The Godfather,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Don Vito Corleone, head of a mafia family, decides to hand over his empire to his youngest son Michael. However, his decision unintentionally puts the lives of his loved ones in grave danger. The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.—srijanarora-152-448595 Michael, the young and idealistic son of Vito Corleone, the head of the most powerful Mafia clan in New York, returns home as a war hero and is determined to live his own life. But tragic circumstances make him face the legacy of his family.—fiveisforsecret The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding with his wife Carmela. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family.—Charlie Ness Vito Corleone is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.—TheElfstone In late summer 1945, guests are gathered for the wedding reception of Don Vito Corleone's daughter Connie (Talia Shire) and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo). Vito (Marlon Brando), the head of the Corleone Mafia family, is known to friends and associates as ""Godfather."" He and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the Corleone family lawyer, are hearing requests for favors because, according to Italian tradition, ""no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day."" One of the men who asks the Don for a favor is Amerigo Bonasera, a successful mortician and acquaintance of the Don, whose daughter was brutally beaten by two young men because she refused their advances; the men received minimal punishment from the presiding judge. The Don is disappointed in Bonasera, who'd avoided most contact with the Don due to Corleone's nefarious business dealings. The Don's wife is godmother to Bonasera's shamed daughter, a relationship the Don uses to extract new loyalty from the undertaker. The Don agrees to have his men punish the young men responsible (in a non-lethal manner) in return for future service if necessary.Meanwhile, the Don's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a decorated US Marine hero returning from World War II service, arrives at the wedding and tells his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) anecdotes about his family, informing her about his father's criminal life; he reassures her that he is different from his family and doesn't plan to join them in their criminal dealings. The wedding scene serves as critical exposition for the remainder of the film, as Michael introduces the main characters to Kay. Fredo (John Cazale), Michael's next older brother, is a bit dim-witted and quite drunk by the time he finds Michael at the party. Santino, who is nicknamed Sonny (James Caan), the Don's eldest child and next in line to become Don upon his father's retirement, is married but he is a hot-tempered philanderer who sneaks into a bedroom to have sex with one of Connie's bridesmaids, Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero). Tom Hagen is not related to the family by blood but is considered one of the Don's sons because he was homeless when he befriended Sonny in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan and the Don took him in and saw to Tom's upbringing and education. Now a talented attorney, Tom is being groomed for the important position of consigliere (counselor) to the Don, despite his non-Sicilian heritage.Also among the guests at the celebration is the famous singer Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), Corleone's godson, who has come from Hollywood to petition Vito's help in landing a movie role that will revitalize his flagging career. Jack Woltz (John Marley), the head of the studio, denies Fontane the part (a character much like Johnny himself), which will make him an even bigger star, but Don Corleone explains to Johnny: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The Don also receives congratulatory salutations from Luca Brasi, a terrifying enforcer in the criminal underworld, and fills a request from the baker, Nazorine, who made Connie's wedding cake who wishes for his nephew Enzo to become an American citizen.After the wedding, Hagen is dispatched to Los Angeles to meet with Woltz, but Woltz angrily tells him that he will never cast Fontane in the role. Woltz holds a grudge because Fontane seduced and ""ruined"" a starlet who Woltz had been grooming for stardom and with whom he had a sexual relationship. Woltz is persuaded to give Johnny the role, however, when he wakes up early the next morning and feels something wet in his bed. He pulls back the sheets and finds himself in a pool of blood; he screams in horror when he discovers the severed head of his prized $600,000 stud horse, Khartoum, in the bed with him. (A deleted scene from the film implies that Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), Vito's top ""button man"" or hitman, is responsible.)Upon Hagen's return, the family meets with Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), who is being backed by the rival Tattaglia family. He asks Don Corleone for financing as well as political and legal protection for importing and distributing heroin. Despite the huge profit to be made, Vito Corleone refuses, explaining that his political influence would be jeopardized by a move into the narcotics trade -- the judges and politicians he's allied himself with over the course of several decades would renounce their friendships with him if he were to enter the drug trade. The Don's eldest son, Sonny, who had earlier urged the family to enter the narcotics trade, breaks rank during the meeting and begins to question Sollozzo's assurances as to the Corleone Family's investment being guaranteed by the Tattaglia Family. His father, angry at Sonny's dissension in a non-family member's presence, silences Sonny with a single look and privately rebukes him later. Don Corleone then dispatches Luca Brasi to infiltrate Sollozzo's organization and report back with information. During the meeting, while Brasi is bent over to allow Bruno Tattaglia to light his cigarette, he is stabbed in the hand by Sollozzo, and is subsequently garroted by an assassin.Soon after his meeting with Sollozzo, Don Corleone is gunned down in an assassination attempt just outside his office, and it is not immediately known whether he has survived. Fredo Corleone had been assigned driving and protection duty for his father when Paulie Gatto, the Don's usual bodyguard, had called in sick. Fredo proves to be ineffectual, fumbling with his gun and unable to shoot back. When Sonny hears about the Don being shot and Paulie's absence, he orders Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano), one of his father's two ""caporegimes,"" to find Paulie and bring him to the Don's house.Sollozzo abducts Tom Hagen and holds him for several hours, persuading him to offer Sonny the deal previously offered to his father. When Tom is released, Sollozzo gets word that the Don has survived the attempt on his life. He angrily tells Tom to convince Sonny to accept his offer.Enraged, Sonny refuses to consider it and issues an ultimatum to the Tattaglias: turn over Sollozzo or face a lengthy, bloody and costly (for both sides) gang war. They refuse, and instead send Sonny ""a Sicilian message,"" in the form of two fresh fish wrapped in Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest, telling the Corleones that Luca Brasi ""sleeps with the fishes.""Clemenza later takes Paulie and one of the family's hitmen, Rocco Lampone, for a drive into Manhattan. Sonny wants to ""go to the mattresses"" -- set up beds in apartments for Corleone button men to operate out of in the event that the crime war breaks out. On their way back from Manhattan, Clemenza has Paulie stop the car in a remote area so he can urinate. Rocco shoots Paulie dead; he and Clemenza leave Paulie and the car behind.Michael, whom the other Mafia families consider a ""civilian"" and not involved in mob business, visits his father at a small private hospital after having dinner with Kay at her hotel. He is shocked to find that no one is guarding him -- a nurse tells him that the men were interfering with hospital policy and were told to leave by the police about 10 minutes before Mike's arrival. Realizing that his father is again being set up to be killed, he calls Sonny for help, moves his father to another room, and goes outside to watch the entrance. Michael enlists help from Enzo the baker (Gabriele Torrei), who has come to the hospital to pay his respects. Together, they bluff away Sollozzo's men as they drive by. Police cars soon appear bringing the corrupt Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), who viciously punches Michael in the cheek and breaks his jaw when Michael insinuates that Sollozzo paid McCluskey to set up his father. Just then, Hagen arrives with ""private detectives"" licensed to carry guns to protect Don Corleone, and he takes the injured Michael home. Sonny responds by having Bruno Tattaglia (Tony Giorgio), the eldest son and underboss of Don Phillip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina), killed (off-camera).Following the attempt on the Don's life at the hospital, Sollozzo requests a meeting with the Corleones, which Captain McCluskey will attend as Sollozzo's bodyguard. When Michael volunteers to kill both men during the meeting, Sonny and the other senior Family members are amused; however, Michael convinces them that he is serious and that killing Sollozzo and McCluskey is in the family's interest: ""It's not personal. It's strictly business."" Because Michael is considered a civilian, he won't be regarded as a suspicious ambassador for the Corleones. Although police officers are usually off limits for hits, Michael argues that since McCluskey is corrupt and has illegal dealings with Sollozzo, he is fair game. Michael also implies that newspaper reporters that the Corleones have on their payroll would delight in publishing stories about a corrupt police captain.Michael meets with Clemenza, who prepares a small pistol for him, covering the trigger and grip with tape to prevent any fingerprint evidence. He instructs Michael about the proper way to perform the assassination and tells him to leave the gun behind. He also tells Michael that the family were all very proud of Michael for becoming a war hero during his service in the Marines and that a war like the impending one that Sollozzo's and McClusky's killings will spark is necessary about every five to tens years to clean out the ambition and resentment that builds between the Five Families. Clemenza shows great confidence that Michael can perform the job and tells him it will all go smoothly. The plan is to have the Corleone's informers find out the location of the meeting and plant the revolver before Michael, Sollozzo and McCluskey arrive. Before he leaves for the meeting, Sonny tells Michael he'll get word to Kay about not saying goodbye.Before the meeting in a small Italian restaurant in the Bronx, McCluskey frisks Michael for weapons and finds him clean. After a few minutes where Michael and Sollozzo converse in Italian, Michael excuses himself to go to the bathroom, where he retrieves the planted revolver. Returning to the table, he fatally shoots Sollozzo, then McCluskey. Michael is sent to hide in Sicily while the Corleone family prepares for all-out warfare with the Five Families (who are united against the Corleones) as well as a general clampdown on the mob by the police and government authorities. Three months later, when the don returns home from the hospital, he is distraught to learn that it was Michael who killed Sollozzo and McCluskey.Meanwhile, Connie and Carlo's marriage is disintegrating. They argue frequently over Carlo's suspected infidelity and his possessive behavior toward Connie. By Italian tradition, nobody, not even a high-ranking Mafia don, can intervene in a married couple's personal disputes, even if they involve infidelity, money, or domestic abuse. One day, Sonny sees a bruise on Connie's face and she tells him that Carlo hit her after she asked him if he was having an affair. Sonny tracks down and severely beats Carlo in the middle of a crowded street for brutalizing the pregnant Connie, and threatens to kill Carlo if he ever harms Connie again. An angry Carlo responds by plotting with Tattaglia and Don Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), the Corleones' chief rivals, to have Sonny killed.Later, Carlo has one of his mistresses phone his house, knowing that Connie will answer. The woman asks Connie to tell Carlo not to meet her tonight. The very pregnant and distraught Connie throws a tantrum, throwing the plates with their dinner around the dining room and kitchen. Carlo takes advantage of the altercation to beat Connie in order to lure Sonny out in the open and away from the Corleone compound. When Connie phones the compound to tell Sonny that Carlo has beaten her again, the enraged Sonny drives off (alone and unprotected) to fulfill his threat against Carlo. On the way to Connie and Carlo's house, Sonny is ambushed at a toll booth on the Long Island Causeway and violently shot to death by several carloads of hitmen wielding Thompson sub-machine guns.Tom Hagen relays the news of Sonny's massacre to the Don, who calls in the favor from Bonasera to personally handle the embalming of Sonny's body. Rather than seek revenge for Sonny's killing, Don Corleone meets with the heads of the Five Families to negotiate a cease-fire. Not only is the conflict draining all their assets and threatening their survival, but ending it is the only way that Michael can return home safely. Reversing his previous decision, Vito agrees that the Corleone family will provide political protection for Tattaglia's traffic in heroin, as long as it is controlled and not sold to children. At the meeting, Don Corleone deduces that Don Barzini, not Tattaglia, was ultimately behind the start of the mob war and Sonny's death, despite showing early signs of senility.In Sicily, Michael patiently waits out his exile, protected by Don Tommasino (Corrado Gaipa), an old family friend. Michael aimlessly wanders the countryside, accompanied by his ever-present bodyguards, Calo (Franco Citti) and Fabrizio (Angelo Infanti). In a small village, Michael meets and falls in love with Apollonia Vitelli (Simonetta Stefanelli), the beautiful young daughter of a bar owner. They court and marry in the traditional Sicilian fashion, but soon Michael's presence becomes known to Corleone enemies. One day, while Michael is teaching his new bride to drive, Tommasino brings the bad news about Sonny's assassination. He wants to movie Michael to a safer location. As the couple is about to leave, Apollonia is killed as a result of a rigged car (originally intended for Michael) exploding on ignition; Michael, who saw the car explode, spots Fabrizio hurriedly leaving the grounds seconds before the explosion, implicating him in the assassination plot. (In a deleted scene, Fabrizio is found years later and killed.)With his safety guaranteed, Michael returns home. More than a year later, in 1950, he reunites with his former girlfriend Kay after a total of four years of separation -- three in Italy and one in America. He tells her he wants them to be married. Although Kay is hurt that he waited so long to contact her, she accepts his proposal. With Don Vito semi-retired, Sonny dead, and middle brother Fredo considered incapable of running the family business, Michael is now in charge; he promises Kay he will make the family business completely legitimate within five years.Two years later, Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda), complain that they are being pushed around by the Barzini Family and ask permission to strike back, but Michael denies the request. He plans to move the family operations to Nevada and after that, Clemenza and Tessio may break away to form their own families in the New York area. Michael further promises Connie's husband, Carlo, that he will be his right hand man in Nevada (Carlo had grown up there), unaware of his part in Sonny's assassination. Tom Hagen has been removed as consigliere and is now merely the family's lawyer, with Vito serving as consigliere. Privately, Hagen inquires about his change in status, and also questions Michael about a new regime of ""soldiers"" secretly being built under Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui). Don Vito explains to Hagen that Michael is acting on his advice.Another year or so later, Michael travels to Las Vegas and meets with Moe Greene (Alex Rocco), a rich and shrewd casino boss looking to expand his business dealings. After the Don's attempted assassination, Fredo had been sent to Las Vegas to learn about the casino business from Greene. Michael arrogantly offers to buy out Greene but is rudely rebuffed. Greene believes the Corleones are weak and that he can secure a better deal from Barzini. As Moe and Michael heatedly negotiate, Fredo sides with Moe. After Moe storms out of the meeting, Michael warns Fredo to never again ""take sides with anyone against the family.""Michael returns home. In a private moment, Vito explains his expectation that the Family's enemies will attempt to murder Michael by using a trusted associate to arrange a meeting as a pretext for assassination. Vito also reveals that he had never really intended a life of crime for Michael, hoping that his youngest son would hold legitimate power as a senator or governor. Some months later, Vito collapses and dies while playing with his young grandson Anthony (Anthony Gounaris) in his tomato garden. At the burial, Tessio conveys a proposal for a meeting with Barzini, which identifies Tessio as the traitor that Vito was expecting.Kay asks Michael if he'll agree to be godfather to Connie and Carlo's newborn son. Michael agrees and seizes the opportunity to eliminate competition from the other five families while also using the baptism as an alibi. The murders occur simultaneously during the ceremony:Don Stracci (Don Costello) is gunned down along with his bodyguard in a hotel elevator by a shotgun-wielding Clemenza.Moe Greene is killed while having a massage, shot through the eye by an unidentified assassin.Don Cuneo (Rudy Bond) is trapped in a revolving door at the St. Regis Hotel and shot dead by soldier Willi Cicci (Joe Spinell).Don Tattaglia is assassinated in bed, along with a prostitute, by Rocco Lampone and an unknown associate.Don Barzini is killed on the steps of his office building along with his bodyguard and driver, shot by Al Neri (Richard Bright), disguised in his old police uniform.After the baptism, Tessio believes he and Hagen are on their way to the meeting between Michael and Barzini that he has arranged. Instead, he is surrounded by Willi Cicci and other button men as Hagen steps away. Realizing that Michael has uncovered his betrayal, Tessio tells Hagen that he always respected Michael, and that his disloyalty ""was only business."" He asks if Tom can get him off for ""old times' sake,"" but Tom says he cannot. Tessio is driven away and never seen again (it is implied that Cicci shoots and kills Tessio with his own gun after he disarms him prior to entering the car).Meanwhile, Michael confronts Carlo about Sonny's murder and forces him to admit his role in setting up the ambush, having been approached by Barzini himself. (The hitmen who killed Sonny were the core members of Barzini's personal bodyguard.) Michael assures Carlo he will not be killed, but his punishment is exclusion from all family business. He hands Carlo a plane ticket to exile in Las Vegas. However, when Carlo gets into a car headed for the airport, he is immediately garroted to death by Clemenza, on Michael's orders.Later, a hysterical Connie confronts Michael at the Corleone compound as movers carry away the furniture in preparation for the family move to Nevada. She accuses him of murdering Carlo in retribution for Carlo's brutal treatment of her and for Carlo's suspected involvement in Sonny's murder and that Michael craftily waited until their father died so Vito couldn't stop him. After Connie is removed from the house, Kay questions Michael about Connie's accusation, but he refuses to answer, reminding her to never ask him about his business or what he does for a living. She insists, and Michael outright lies, reassuring his wife that he played no role in Carlo's death. Kay believes him and is relieved. The film ends with Clemenza and new caporegimes Rocco Lampone and Al Neri arriving and paying their respects to Michael. Clemenza kisses Michael's hand and greets him as ""Don Corleone."" As Kay watches, the office door is closed."
The Poseidon Adventure,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069113/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of passengers must embark on a harrowing struggle for survival after a rogue wave capsizes their cruise ship at sea. A passenger ship, on her way to the scrap yard is pushed to her limits by the new owners to save on the dismantling fees. A tidal wave hits her, flipping her over so that all the internal rooms are upside down. A priest takes a mixed band of survivors on a journey through the bowels of the ship in an attempt to survive.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> At midnight on New Year's Eve, the SS Poseidon is struck by a 90-foot tidal wave and is capsized. Reverend Frank Scott leads nine survivors; an elderly couple, Manny and Belle Rosen headed to Israel to see their grandson; A New York detective and his ex-prostitute wife, Mike and Linda Rogo on their second honeymoon to Italy; A young brother and sister, Robin and Susan Shelby going to meet their parents in Greece; A haberdasher James Martin; a pop singer Nonnie Parry, and a waiter from the ship Acres. They travel from the grand ballroom struggling through, steam, fire and rising water in the upside-down ship to reach the bottom (the propeller shaft), now the top.—TomRicciardi <tomricci@aol.com> The SS Poseidon, a trans-Atlantic passenger steamship slated for retirement, is making its way across the Atlantic from New York City to Athens on its last voyage. On the bridge, company representative Linarcos (Fred Sadoff) orders the ship's master, Captain Harrison (Leslie Nielsen), to empty ballast and proceed at full speed, against the Captain's better judgement.Meanwhile, Detective Lieutenant Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and his ex-prostitute wife Linda (Stella Stevens)--seasick, like much of the passengers--receive an invitation to the captain's table. Reverend Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), a priest questioning his faith, delivers an unnerving sermon at Sunday service. Susan Shelby (Pamela Sue Martin) and her younger brother Robin (Eric Shea) are traveling to meet their parents. Robin is interested in how the ship works and frequently visits the engine room. Retired hardware store owner Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) and his wife Belle (Shelley Winters) are going to Israel to meet their two-year-old grandson for the first time. Haberdasher James Martin (Red Buttons) is a love-shy, health-conscious bachelor. The ship's singer, Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley) rehearses for the New Year celebration with her band, which includes her brother Teddy on drums.That evening, New Year's Eve, everybody gathers in the dining room to celebrate. Captain Harrison is called back to the bridge because of an emergency report of an undersea earthquake near Crete. Harrison receives word from the lookout that there is a huge wave heading towards them. He immediately issues a mayday, but it is already too late. The wave hits the bridge, drowning Harrison, Linarcos and other ship's officers. The ship rolls over, killing and injuring most of the people on board.After the capsized derelict steadies, the surviving passengers and crew in the dining room take stock of their predicament. Robin looks for his sister, who has ended up under a table attached to what is now the ceiling. Scott assembles a team to hold a tablecloth that will cushion her fall and coaxes Susan to jump to safety. Acres, an injured waiter, is trapped at the galley door now high above them. Scott seizes on this, saying that rescue will be found 'upwards', at the outer hull, which is now above water. Robin confirms this, telling the group that the steel plating near the aft propeller shaft is just one inch thick. After some more talking and discussing, Manny, Belle, Mike, Linda, Nonnie, Susan, Robin, Acres, and Martin reluctantly agree to go with Scott. The group need something to climb up to Acres, so they eventually agree to use the Christmas tree as a makeshift ladder. Scott tries to convince more passengers to join his group, but all remain where they are in hopes of rescue.Just after the small group reaches the galley, there is a series of explosions and seawater begins to flood the ballroom. The survivors left behind rush to the Christmas tree, but the weight of everyone trying to climb at once pulls it over into the rising water. Scott, the last to leave, sadly closes the kitchen doors on the desperation below.Acres and Scott find the galley, but a warning light is on and the fire door, hot to the touch, has been shut. Scott enters the incinerated kitchen to investigate, returns, and the survivors pick their way through to a staircase on the other side. Scott climbs the ramped underside of the stairs first and he and Martin use a salvaged firehose to pull Rogo and Acres up. While Rogo pulls the others up, Scott and Acres go ahead and find the only exit to 'Broadway' (the main passageway of the ship) is blocked. Acres suggests an access tunnel to the funnel shaft. Scott undogs the opening and returns for Linda, Martin and Nonnie. Just then, water floods the staircase and the now-panicked survivors race to the tunnel.Temporarily safe, Scott leads them to an access tunnel. Rogo had been instructed to look after everybody but, just as Martin and Nonnie climb into the hole, water begins to fill the corridor. They make it into the funnel and began to climb up with Acres above them. Suddenly, the ship rocks from another series of explosions and Acres falls into the churning water and is lost. Rogo makes an attempt to save him, but the shaft explodes and forces him to abandon Acres.While climbing out of the shaft and into 'Broadway', Scott and Rogo argue heatedly over the loss of Acres when their group meets a larger band of survivors. These are led by the ship's medic and are heading towards the bow. Rogo argues with Scott about which direction to go and gives Scott only fifteen minutes to go aft to find the engine room. Everybody else looks for supplies. Scott and Susan (who has a crush on the charismatic Reverend) find the hatch that leads to the engine room. Scott tells Susan to return to the others and go forward if he's not back in five minutes. After waiting, Susan tells the others the bad news, but Scott reappears and announces he has found the way to the engine room.While Susan shows the survivors where to go, Scott notices that Robin is missing. He finds Robin just as the water begins to flood Broadway. They race to the hatch and make it up just as the water floods the corridor.The group finds the engine room is on the other side of a flooded corridor, so someone must swim through with a line so the others can find a way across. Belle, a former trained swimmer, claims that she could swim under it, but Scott refuses and dives in with the line. Halfway through, a panel collapses on Scott and traps him. The survivors notice something is wrong and Belle dives in to save him. She finds Scott and they make it to the other side. As Scott secures the lifeline, Belle suddenly has a heart attack and collapses. With her last breath, she tells Scott to give her ""Chai"" pendant (representing the Hebrew sign for life) to her husband who in turn will give it to her grandson. Scott weeps at her loss.Rogo swims over during the delay to make sure Belle and Scott are okay. When he surfaces, he sees Belle's death, and returns to the other side. Rosen suspects something is wrong and swims to the other side only to find his wife's lifeless body. A few minutes later, the others make it across and find Manny in tears. Initially he is unwilling to go on, but Scott gives him Belle's Chai pendant, reminding him that he still has a reason to live.Scott continues aft and finds the propeller shaft room's watertight door 'below' a steam valve. He returns and leads the survivors across a catwalk to the door, but there is another series of explosions and Linda falls to her death, presumptively of a broken neck. An infuriated and heartbroken Rogo blames her death on Scott, calling him a ""lying, murderous son-of-a-bitch.""More explosions rupture a large pipe which releases clouds of scalding-hot steam that block the group's path to their escape. Scott, outraged about the three deaths and this final obstacle, screams at God that he has betrayed the survivors. He leaps and grabs onto the burning-hot valve wheel to shut off the escaping steam. Hanging from it, Scott slowly turns off the steam, all the while cursing God. The helpless Scott tells Rogo to lead the group on, then lets go of the wheel and is lost to the flaming, oily water below. Susan, in anguish, tries to follow him.Rogo finally leads the remaining survivors--Rosen, Martin, Nonnie, Susan and Robin--through the watertight door and into the propeller shaft room, but they find no rescuers. Suddenly, they hear a noise outside the ship. They bang on the metal hull to get the rescuers' attention and, after several frantic attempts, finally get a response. The rescuers cut a hole through the hull using a blow torch and help the group from the ship. The survivors, the only six alive after the disaster, fly off to safety by helicopter."
Jeremiah Johnson,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068762/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mountain man who wishes to live the life of a hermit becomes the unwilling object of a long vendetta by the Crow tribe and proves to be a match for their warriors in single combat on the early frontier. During the mid-nineteenth century, Jeremiah Johnson, after a stint in the US Army, decides that he would prefer a life of solitude and more importantly peace by living with nature in the mountains of the frontier of the American west. This plan entails finding a piece of land upon which to build a house. This quest ends up being not quite what he envisioned as he does require the assistance of others to find his footing, and in turn, he amasses friends and acquaintances along the way, some who become more a part of his life than he would have imagined. Perhaps most importantly, some of those people provide him with the knowledge of how to co-exist with some of the many Indian tribes, most importantly the Crow, on whose land in Colorado Jeremiah ultimately decides to build his home. But an act by Jeremiah upon a request by the US Cavalry leads to a chain of events that may forever change the peaceful relationship he worked so hard to achieve with his neighbors and their land.—Huggo An American soldier goes west to escape the Mexican War and becomes a mountain man. He is befriended by a wily old trapper who teaches him how to survive. After unavoidably violating an Indian burial ground, he loses his new Indian wife and their adopted child to the Indians' revenge; a vendetta between him and the Crow tribe ruins his idyllic life as a fur trapper. Gorgeous scenery and a great role for Will Geer in a thoughtful meditation on the American West.—Anonymous This tale of isolation in the great rocky mountains, perhaps reflects America's mood as the Vietnam war was coming to a close as much as anything else. Johnson, seemingly war weary, yet with a sense of respect for indigenous cultures as if one informs the other. The only thing he seems to want is to share utopia with those who were there before him and perhaps leave his implied past behind. But even in the vacuum of an isolated life, Jeremiah Johnson seems doomed by threads to culture he cannot completely escape. As with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" one can't help but feel that along with Indians and animals with which he shares the land, ""A brave new world"" will soon rush in and overrun them all.—TR The opening scene depicts an early Rocky Mountain riverside trading post bustling with activity. Indians, trappers and traders of all stripes freely mingle. A young ex-soldier named Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford), fleeing civilization, equips himself with the needed foodstuffs, gear and pack mule required for life as a solitary mountain man.After a short time in the high mountains, Johnson finds himself critically short on both food and basic survival skills. While comically struggling to retrieve an elusive trout from a swift mountain stream, Johnson is startled to discover a bemused Indian brave silently watching him. The brave quietly rides downstream. After failing in his attempt to kindle a warming fire in the deep snow, Johnson comes upon a dead mountain man, frozen against a tree. A note attached to the dead man's coat identifies him as Hatchet Jack and explains that he was mauled and disabled by a grizzly bear. He bequeaths his prized .50-caliber rifle to whoever finds him. Johnson uses the gun to bag his first deer.Johnson awakens the next morning to find that his horse has died in the night. He continues through the deep snows on foot, leading his pack mule. He is soon surprised by a venerable old mountain man whose bear hunt he has inadvertently spoiled. The old mountain man, Bear Claw (Will Geer), patiently teaches Johnson the ways of the mountains. While hunting elk, Johnson and Bear Claw are surrounded by a Crow Indian party, but Johnson successfully barters their way out of trouble. The leader of the Crows is the same brave who observed Johnson's abortive fishing attempt earlier.After parting with Bear Claw, Johnson comes across a cabin where an Indian band has killed several white settlers. One child survives, along with his grieving, traumatized mother who has clearly gone mad. She frantically places her equally traumatized son in Johnson's charge, apparently intent on killing herself. Since the boy is unable to speak his own name, Johnson names the boy Caleb. As their journey continues, the pair comes across another mountain man, Del Gue (Stefan Gierash), buried up to his neck in burning sand by the same Blackfoot raiding party that attacked the settler cabin. Johnson rescues him and they track down the raiding party, intent on recovering Gue's horses and weapons. Against Johnson's wishes, Gue ambushes the Blackfoot party that night, and the Indians are killed with Johnson's reluctant assistance. Del Gue scalps the dead Blackfeet.This works to Johnson's advantage when they are subsequently surrounded by Flathead Indians, who are the Crows' blood enemies. Seeing the captured Blackfoot ponies and fresh scalps and believing Johnson to be a great warrior, the Flathead chief honors Johnson by giving his daughter to him as a bride. Del Gue goes his own way, and Johnson leads his newfound family deeper into the wilderness.Despite a mute ""stepson"" and a wife he cannot communicate with, Johnson finds fulfillment in his new life. They build a fine cabin alongside a mountain stream before Johnson leaves to hunt for buffalo. A few days after his return, a cavalry detail arrives at the cabin looking for a mountain guide. A small wagon party has become stranded in the high country and is in danger of starving in the freezing cold. Johnson is goaded into leading the rescue attempt.Once in the high mountains, the party encounters a sacred Crow burial ground blocking a mountain pass. Johnson explains they will have to go around, adding considerable distance to the journey. The cavalry officers are skeptical, explaining that the detour could result in many dead settlers. Against his better judgement, Johnson tells the troopers to stay quiet and follow along in single file through the burial ground. It is of no use; the Indians soon know of the desecration. After locating the wagon train, Johnson parts with the white men and traverses the burial ground again, suddenly becoming spooked. He rushes back to his cabin to find his wife and stepson dead, murdered by the Crows. Johnson is wracked with guilt and grief. After some time, he tenderly places the boy and his wife in the bed, covers them, and sets fire to the cabin.Johnson tracks down the murderous group of six or seven Crow warriors and attacks their campsite, without concern for his own life. He wipes out the entire group, becoming wounded in the process. His reprisal invites a seemingly endless series of solitary attacks upon Johnson as he travels the mountains. One by one, the Crow warriors ambush him, only to die in the process. Johnson himself is wounded many times. He becomes a living legend among the Indians and the white settlers alike. During this period, Johnson crosses paths once again with both Bear Claw and Del Gue, who are aware of his predicament. They wish him well and take their leave.After months of attacks, a weary Johnson sees one more Crow warrior approaching in the distance. He warily cocks his rifle and readies for a fight. Suddenly, the Indian raises his hand in tribute and in peace. It is over. Johnson breaks into a wide grin- it is the same Crow who watched him struggle to catch a trout long ago."
Cabaret,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068327/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A female girlie club entertainer in Weimar Republic era Berlin romances two men while the Nazi Party rises to power around them. Cambridge University student Brian Roberts arrives in Berlin in 1931 to complete his German studies. Without much money, he plans on making a living teaching English while living in an inexpensive rooming house, where he befriends another of the tenants, American Sally Bowles. She is outwardly a flamboyant, perpetually happy person who works as a singer at the decadent Kit Kat Klub, a cabaret styled venue. Sally's outward façade is matched by that of the Klub, overseen by the omnipresent Master of Ceremonies. Sally draws Brian into her world, and initially wants him to be one of her many lovers, until she learns that he is a homosexual, albeit a celibate one. Among their other friends are his students, the poor Fritz Wendel, who wants to be a gigolo to live a comfortable life, and the straight-laced and beautiful Natalia Landauer, a Jewish heiress. Fritz initially sees Natalia as his money ticket, but eventually falls for her. However Natalia is suspect of his motives and cannot overcome their religious differences. Also into Sally and Brian's life comes the wealthy Baron Maximilian von Heune, who has the same outlook on life as Sally, but who has the money to support it. Max is willing to lavish his new friends with gifts and his favors. Around them all is the Nazi uprising, to which they seem to pay little attention or care. But they ultimately learn that life in all its good and particularly bad continues to happen to them and around them.—Huggo In 1931, in Berlin, the English professor from Cambridge Brian Roberts comes to the boarding house where the promiscuous American performer and singer of the Cabaret Kit-Kat Club Sally Bowles lives. They befriend each other and soon Sally discovers that Brian is not attracted by women, but they have a love affair. When Sally meets the wealthy Baron Maximilian von Heune, both Sally and Brian are seduced by the baron. Meanwhile there is the ascension of the Nazi Party.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 1930's Berlin, American Sally Bowles works as a singer in the Kit Kat club. At her rooming house she meets Englishman Brian Roberts who has come to Berlin to improve his German. He hopes to pay his expenses by giving English language lessons. Sally is unconventional and she and Robert have a number of adventures together. The romp continues with several of their friends, including the very rich Maximilian von Heune. Life takes a sudden turn for Sally however and throughout it all, the rise of Nazism casts a shadow over everyone.—garykmcd In Berlin in 1931, American cabaret singer Sally Bowles meets British academic Brian Roberts, who is finishing his university studies. Despite Brian's confusion over his sexuality, the pair become lovers, but the arrival of the wealthy and decadent playboy Maximilian von Heune complicates matters for them both. This love triangle plays out against the rise of the Nazi party and the collapse of the Weimar Republic.—Jwelch5742 Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) is an American-singer and dancer who lives in Germany in the between-wars period. She dreams of becoming rich and famous, but has a clear drinking problem. She works at the Kit-Kat cabaret, a seedy place with suggestive musical numbers. The Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey), introduces and participates in the risque acts at the cabaret.We see Nazis asking for donations from the club patrons, but the owner throws them out.Sally meets Brian Roberts (Michael York) when he takes a room in a flat she shares with some older people. He is in Berlin to finish his PhD and teach English, but is currently penniless. They become friends, but fairly quickly Sally discovers that Brian has been ""unsuccessful"" with women, and it is implied that he is gay. The two become friends, with Sally doing much of the talking. She is loud, brash, an alcoholic always bumming cigarettes and dreaming of stardom (though her talent is apparent, she sells herself short and assumes a destructive lifestyle). We learn her father is a diplomat, but he misses a meeting with her, and has apparently been absent (if apologetic, but efficient to the point of counting words on telegrams) for much of her life.Through the other tenant's conversations, street shots, musical numbers and and a few seemingly random scenes or inserts in conversations, the growing influence of racist ideas and Nazism is foreshadowed.Brian is fascinated by Sally (she is edgy and outspoken and almost out of control, while he is composed and rational) and their friendship ends up as a sexual affair. However, Sally doesn't want to fall in love with him because she wants to marry big money. One day, while complaining at the laundrette because of problems with the timing of the cleaning of some garments, she bumps into Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem). He helps Sally by translating the attendant's German into English. Sally flirts with him, and he offers her a ride in his limousine. Sally falls dazzled when she notices the luxurious car. They go out (Brian, invited, refuses) and Max buys Sally perfume, a fur coat and treats her to a life of luxury.Meanwhile, Sally and Brian have been setting up one student of Brian's, a wanna-be gigolo who plans on meeting and wedding an ugly but rich woman, Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper), with a wealthy heiress, Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson). While Fritz was originally after Natalia's money, he finds he has really fallen for her - and she is in love with him. Ironically, it is Sally's bluntly sexual advice (that both seek) that bring them together.Max also buys Brian gifts and finally wins him over--Brian and Sally visit Max at his castle. Max gives them a first-class treatment, and Sally gets completely starry-eyed. However, there, they learn the truth: Max is married, but he and his wife have decided to lead separate lives with many different lovers and sexual adventures on either side, but never breaking up their marriage, as financially that would be an end to their flamboyant living. The three enjoy an evening of decadence.Later, Sally confesses to Brian that she has slept with Max. Brian confesses that he has too.The Nazis are gaining public acceptance and power. Max, Sally and Brian go to a beer garden and a Nazi youth starts singing a ""patriotic"" song; most of the people join in. On the way home, Brian suggests that the growing Nazi threat may not be contained (by people like Max, even). A Nazi gang beats up the club owner in revenge of their previous treatment. One of the acts in the club is a poignant and ironic ""ode"" to anti-Jew sentiment.Natalia finds her beloved dog dead on her door-step. Brian encourages Fritz to propose to her, as he knows she really does love him, and Fritz loves her as a person - not just for her fortune. Fritz says that it won't happen, because he's penniless. Because of the increasingly hostile atmosphere, Natalia rejects Fritz when he finally proposes. She tells him that the marriage can't take place because she is Jewish. Fritz confesses to Natalia that he is Jewish as well, and they get married in a traditional ceremony immediately.Max sends a note to Sally and Brian, saying that he has to leave the country on ""family business"". He includes money for each of them. Soon, she feels gloomy, and tells Brian that she is pregnant, but doesn't know who the father is. It could be Max or Brian's... She considers an abortion, but Brian asks her to marry him. He asks her to have the baby and tries to convince her that they could be happy together in spite of not being millionaires. His demeanor and expression, however, suggests that he is not pleased with this prospect, as Sally says that she'll think about it. It's implied through scenes of their past decadence, that, if she has a baby, she'll give up the only life she knows, nor ever never be able to become a star or marry a rich man.The next thing Brian notices is that Sally hasn't got the fur coat anymore. Brian realizes that she's given it to the doctor as payment for the abortion. Their relationship is over. Returning to his rational self and seeing Sally for who she is, and the rise of Nazism, he decides to return home.Brian and Sally head to the train station so Brian can return to England. Sally stays behind to keep up her performances at the club. She sings her final ode to fatalism and decadence, ""Cabaret"", and the MC closes the show. The atmosphere is not joyous anymore and Nazis are seen among the patrons in the warped mirror of the sax."
The Getaway,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068638/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A recently-released ex-con and his loyal wife go on the run after a heist goes awry. Carter ""Doc"" McCoy is a career robber, currently in his fourth year of a 10-year prison sentence at the Texas State Penitentiary. After his request for parole is denied although he's a model prisoner, Doc, unable emotionally to endure life inside, asks his loving wife Carol McCoy to contact crooked businessman Jack Beynon, a man with political connections, to secure his release in return for being ""for sale"" to Beynon. Beynon is able to get Doc released, the sale price being for Doc to plan and execute a robbery at a small bank branch in Beacon City, Texas where Beynon knows that $750,000 will be kept in the vault for the next two weeks. Rather than Doc using his own men for the job, Beynon directs that the only other people involved will be the men of his own choosing, Rudy and Frank. There are to be no casualties, which is all right with Doc who is not a murderer. After the robbery is completed and the monies divvied up accordingly, Doc and Carol will cross the border into Mexico to live out their lives away from capture. The robbery doesn't go according to Doc's plan, and Doc and Carol go on the run making their way into Mexico with their share of the loot. Various people are in their pursuit, some who know that they will try to cross into Mexico at one of the two major West Texas border crossings. Other bystanders get directly or indirectly involved in the proceedings; two of those people, seeming straight-laced couple Fran and Harold Clinton, get much more intimately involved than the others. Though it all, Doc and Carol must work through some of their own issues, which arise out of a revelation about Doc's release from prison.—Huggo Doc McCoy has been granted parole. The catch is that Sheriff Beynon expects a small favor from McCoy for his generosity: robbing another bank! Beynon does not really intend to let McCoy walk away after the heist and neither does co-robber Rudy Butler, but stopping Doc proves a trifle difficult.—Stefan Kahrs <smk@dcs.ed.ac.uk> Bank robber Carter ""Doc"" McCoy is paroled from a Texas state prison, somewhat to his surprise. His wife, Carol, has arranged for his parole by sleeping with the politically well connected but corrupt Jack Benyon. Doc is aware of her actions and it eats at him over the next several days. He also learns Benyon had him sprung to rob a bank of $500,000. Doc wants to use his own men, but Benyon insists that two criminals he knows, Rudy Butler and Frank Jackson, take part and a reluctant Doc agrees. Along with Carol, the three men plot the robbery that involves Rudy and Frank entering the front of the bank to control the crowd, then letting Doc in the back door so he can crack the safe. While Rudy and Frank purchase the necessary supplies, Doc and Carol scope the bank, drawing up a timetable for the robbery based on the arrival of employees. Doc also wants Rudy and Frank to wear bulletproof vests, but Rudy refuses. At this point, Doc does not trust these men but has no choice but to go forward with their plan.On the day of the robbery, explosives are placed underneath an abandoned house on the outskirts of town as a diversion. Frank and Rudy enter the bank and order everyone on the ground, then let Doc in the back. As Doc is removing the money from the vault, the bank guard tries to pull his gun, but is shot and killed by Frank. Doc and Carol head to the meeting point in one car, while Rudy and Frank take another. On the way, Rudy shoots and kills Frank, then pushes his body out of the car. At the meeting place, a deserted farmhouse, Rudy tries to kill Doc and Carol as well, but Doc shoots Rudy three times, with his body falling into a ditch. Believing Rudy dead, Doc and Carol drive off to Benyon's ranch in a station wagon with the money, but Rudy staggers out of the ditch, as he was wearing Frank's bulletproof vest and wounded only in the shoulder. In Benyon's office, Doc confronts Benyon about the duplicity and he admits that the robbery was staged to cover a short fall in his own business and also goads Doc with Carol's infidelity. As he does so, Carol quietly enters the room and points a gun at Doc from behind, but kills Benyon instead. Doc and Carol leave, but on the highway, Doc angrily pulls over and starts hitting Carol for not telling him about the situation and has doubts whether he can trust her again.Meanwhile, Rudy, who has a hunch Doc will be heading to El Paso, takes off from the farmhouse in Doc's car and goes to Harold, a local veterinarian and his wife, Fran, forcing to them to treat his gunshot wound and then drive him to El Paso. Harold is immediately scared of Rudy, but his wife, Fran, is turned on by him. She and Rudy openly have an affair, tying Harold to a chair in their motel rooms and forcing him to watch as they have sex, with a despondent Harold eventually committing suicide. Doc and Carol decide to take a train to El Paso. While Doc stashes their getaway car in the train station's garage, Carol puts the valise with the stolen money into a locker. Because the bag is heavy, she accepts help from a stranger, who turns out to be a con man, and switches locker keys with her and steals the bag for himself. Doc chases the con man onto the train, but briefly loses him. In that time, the con man realizes what is in the bag and pockets one of the rolls of hundred dollar bills. When Doc finds the con man, he beats him unconscious, then gets off the train at the next station. He returns to San Antonio to pick up Carol as they will now have to drive to El Paso, due to too many complications in their plan, though Doc does not believe that the police have any way to connect him to the robbery. When he comes to, the con man goes to the police, who find the roll of bills he pocketed and, seeing the bank's name imprinted on the band holding the roll together, realize whose trail they are on. They show mug shots to the con man and other witnesses from the train, who confirm that Doc was the man they saw.When Carol and Doc stop in a small town to buy a portable radio, the store's proprietor recognizes Doc from a TV news report and calls the police. Then, Doc goes to a gun store and buys a pump action shotgun and shells, but notices the police arrive and coming over to grill Carol. Doc goes outside and orders the deputies to kick away their guns and lay down on the ground, and destroys their car with the shotgun. He and Carol abandon their car in a driveway outside of town to catch a passing bus and when they arrive in the next town, Carol buys a new car. That night, they stop for food at a drive-in restaurant, but the waitresses, as well as the cook, recognize Doc and call the police.

Meanwhile, Rudy orders the hotel's owner, at gunpoint, to let him know when Doc arrives and the owner sends his wife and son away for the afternoon. When Doc does arrive, he recognizes this as a sign that something is wrong. The owner informs Rudy as ordered, but when he and Fran try to coax Doc and Carol into the hallway. Doc knocks Rudy out with his gun and decks Fran unconscious in the face to keep her quiet. Meanwhile, Benyon's associates have arrived and Doc engages them in a shootout, causing a scared Fran to run for her life. As he and Carol try to escape through a fire escape from the arriving police, Rudy tries to stop them one last time, but Doc finally kills him.

Last Tango in Paris,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070849/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young Parisian woman meets a middle-aged American businessman who demands their clandestine relationship be based only on sex. While looking for an apartment, Jeanne, a beautiful young Parisienne, encounters Paul, a mysterious American expatriate mourning his wife's recent suicide. Instantly drawn to each other, they have a stormy, passionate affair, in which they do not reveal their names to each other. Their relationship deeply affects their lives, as Paul struggles with his wife's death and Jeanne prepares to marry her fiance, Tom, a film director making a cinema-verite documentary about her.—Erich Schneider <erich@bush.cs.tamu.edu> Crazed with grief after his wife commits suicide, Paul, an American expatriate, roams the streets of Paris until, while apartment hunting, he faces Jeanne, an unknown girl across an empty room. Brutally, without a word, he rapes the soon-compliant stranger. It should have been hit-and-run sex, but Paul stays at the scene of the erotic accident. While arranging his wife's funeral, Paul leases the apartment where he is to meet the puzzled girl for a series of frenzied afternoons. ""No names here,"" he roughly tells her, setting up the rules of the game. They are to shut out the world outside, forfeit their pasts and their identities. Paul degrades Jeanne in every possible way, leveling all her inhibitions into sheer brutality. Paul is soon dissatisfied with mere possession of her body; he must also have her mind. When she rejects his mad love to enter a comfortable marriage with her dull fiancé, Paul finally confesses: ""I love you, you dummy.""—alfiehitchie Jeanne (Maria Schneider) is a 20-year-old Parisian woman wondering the streets looking for an apartment to live for herself and her fiancée. She goes alone to look at an apartment in a region of the Left Bank. There, she runs into a middle-aged, obviously depressed man (Marlon Brando) who is also looking at it. Jeanne quickly identifies him as an American because of his thick accent while they are communicating in French. After a few minutes of silence and some quiet dialogue, he picks her up, backs her against a wall, rips off her panties and has sex with her in the deserted apartment. They are very passionate yet never introduce themselves. When it is over, they each go their separate ways.Jeanne goes to the Paris Metro train station to meet her fiancée Tom (Jean-Pierre Leaud), a young television documentarian who has just returned to Paris following an assignment. They walk back to Jeanne's apartment where she currently lives with her mother having taken care of her since her father, a soldier in the French Foreign Legion, was killed in action in 1958 in Algeria. Despite their genuine loving engagement to be married, Jeanne is unhappy and annoyed that Tom insists on doing a cinéma vérité documentary all about her life and of her father, who is a well-known war hero. He films everything she does.Meanwhile, the middle-aged American man, who is named Paul, returns to a flophouse hotel in a run-down part of the city where he ventures to his apartment and watches a maid wash blood off the bathtub and surrounding walls. The maid speaks to Paul about the fact his French wife, Rose, two days earlier committed suicide in the bathtub by slashing her wrists. Paul doesn't say much and goes to his room to be by himself.The next day, Paul and Jeanne rendezvous back at the vacant apartment. Paul lays out ground rules that they are never to reveal their names to each other and never to discuss the outside world or to talk about their pasts. They are to meet there twice a week only for sex and tell no one about each other. But Jeanne (who has some knowledge of English after overhearing Paul talking to himself about his miserable life) keeps trying to find out who the strange American man is. Paul is adamant and refuses to talk about anything for he only wants to have sex with her and nothing else. Jeanne, unhappy with her own personal life, agrees to their arrangement. They lease several items of furniture (couch, chairs, table, bed, etc.) and bring it to the apartment which Paul signs a lease under a false name.The following day, Paul meets with Rose's mother (Maria Michi) to talk about the funeral arrangements. Paul soon becomes furious with her, screaming and cursing at her in a mixture of English and French, after she tells him she wants Rose to have absolution from a priest. Paul does not think that a person who committed suicide should receive absolution because (in his mind) killing oneself is a mortal sin.Meanwhile, Jeanne takes Tom and his camera crew on a tour of her former childhood house and shows him all her antiques. She will not tell him about her very first love who was her cousin. Ironically, Jeanne's cousin was also named Paul (not the same man.)Back in the apartment, Jeanne and Paul meet again where Jeanne wants to talk about her cousin, but Paul angrily stops her, reminding Jeanne of their agreement not to reveal anything, not even about what she did during the day. However, Paul soon relents and agrees to let her briefly talk about her cousin on the condition that no names are to be used. Jeanne talks about her cousin being the first man that she ever had sex with and that it was awkward, but nice. Paul then talks about his youth in the American Midwest and his unhappy childhood. Jeanne is proud she got some information about him, but Paul hints that he wasn't telling the truth. Jeanne becomes angry and asserts that Paul is an egoist and correctly assumes that something terrible happened in his life to explain his need to vent his anger and rage by having a meaningless sexual relationship with her. Paul will neither deny nor admit that Jeanne is right about him. Fed up with his arrogance and egotism, Jeanne masturbates.Another day or so later, Paul visits Marcel (Massimo Girotti), a tenant who lives in the hotel/flophouse that he and Rose managed and operated. It turns out that Marcel was Rose's secret lover. Paul doesn't know what she saw in Marcel or why she killed herself.Jeanne continues to get angry with Tom over filming her wherever she goes. After another argument with Tom, she returns to the vacant apartment to meet with Paul again, wanting to have sex wit him. She is shocked when Paul sodomizes her with a stick of butter, and forces her to renounce the Holy family, the Catholic Church, and all that broke her will as a child. It is painful for her, but she obeys.Another day later, Jeanne is in her wedding dress with her mother and various relatives and guests at the wedding rehearsal. Jeanne becomes more frustrated and insecure with everything happening around her and she leaves the rehearsal and returns to the vacant apartment, still wearing her wedding dress to meet with Paul again. She tells him that she couldn't leave him; although she is engaged to be married to someone she insists she loves while she does not love Paul. After helping her change out of her dress and bathing her, Paul tells Jeanne that true love in this world doesn't exist. To find her true love, Paul says, she ""must go up into the ass of death"". He orders her to snip off her fingernails on two of her fingers and put the fingers ""up my ass"". She obeys. They are both delirious with passion.A little later, Rose's funeral and wake are held at the flophouse. Afterwords, Paul sits alone by Rose's coffin. He insults her dead body terribly over why she committed suicide and left him all alone. He then realizes that he never really did know her or the person that she really was. He cries. He calls her ""sweetheart"". He wished he knew why she killed herself and left behind no note or reason for the act. He wishes he could do the same. He pauses when a prostitute arrives at the flophouse with a client, but Paul chases them away. He follows the prostitute's client a short distance and assaults him before fleeing.A few days later, Jeanne arrives at the apartment only to find it deserted. The ""mysterious American"" (Paul) is gone. It would appear that he has left her for good. Tearfully, she goes back to Tom and asks him to come look at the apartment. After visiting the flat and looking around, Jeanne asks Tom if it would be a good place for both of them to live after they get married. He doesn't like it and thinks it smells due to a musky odor as if someone had recently had sex in the apartment. He insists that the two of them live somewhere else as adults and not as overgrown, oversexed children. Tom walks out, leaving Jeanne all by herself.A little later, while Jeanne is walking on a boulevard, Paul comes up to her. Jeanne insists that their relationship is over for she has decided to get married to Tom. (She defiantly tells Paul her fiancée's name after he angrily tells her ""I said no names!""). Being the egoist that he is, Paul won't accept her decision to break up with him, and he finally begins to tell her all about himself and about how his wife committed suicide weeks earlier (without revealing his name or wife's name). Paul wants to continue their secret relationship of sex to purge his painful feelings about his wife's suicide. All he wants is meaningless sex because he does not want to feel anything at all.Paul and Jeanne spend the rest of the day getting drunk in a cafe where a tango dance contest is taking place. After Paul pesters her, Jeanne alternately tells him that she does love him, but that their relationship is over for she has still decided to marry Tom. They then join the rest of the tango dancers on the dance floor, where she masturbates him, but then runs off, telling Paul ""it's finished!"" Paul chases after her through the streets, telling her that it will never end.Jeanne runs back to her mother's apartment where Paul forces himself inside and tells her that he will never let her go. Paul tells Jeanne that he needs her in order to continue not to feel anything. It is here that Paul finally asks Jeanne to tell him her name. Just after Jeanne tells Paul her name, he lunges at her and she pulls out a pistol from a desk drawer (her father's military service revolver) and fatally shoots Paul once in the chest. Paul stumbles out to the balcony to view the sights of Paris one last time before he collapses to the floor of the balcony, dead. The final shot shows a shaken Jeanne rehearsing with herself over what to tell the police, as she prepares to call them, telling them that she does not know the man who assaulted her, or his name."

The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068853/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In Vinegaroon, Texas, former outlaw Roy Bean appoints himself the judge for the region and dispenses his brand of justice as he sees fit. A no account outlaw establishes his own particular brand of law and order and builds a town on the edges of civilization in this farcical western. With the aid of an old law text and unpredictable notions Roy Bean distinguishes between lawbreakers and lawgivers by way of his pistols.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> It's the turn of the nineteenth into twentieth centuries in Vinegaroon, Texas, west of the Rio Pecos, an area known for its general lawlessness. Due largely to an incident which nearly kills him, outlaw Roy Bean appoints himself the judge for the region, he setting up his residence and court in what was previously the saloon and whorehouse in town. He figures he has the moral authority and knowledge of the laws of Texas to become a judge in what was his flagrant disregard of those laws up to this point. He presides over court with a book of Texas statutes in front of him and his fan worship of actress Lillie Langtry in the form of large posters of her behind him. He also appoints a band of fellow outlaws as his marshals, who work solely under his direction. Standing by him through these proceedings is a young Mexican woman named Maria Elena, who saved him from that near death incident, she, in what is to look proper, living in the small shack next to the saloon instead of with him in the saloon. He becomes renowned for brandishing his form of largely illegal justice, which usually ends in the person on trial being convicted on loose judgments and hanged outside the saloon. As an odd and interesting assortment of people (and some non-humans) pass through Vinegaroon and Roy's life, he is able to build the town largely in his vision. But as he has many detractors, the question becomes how long he will last before someone hits the big target that is on his back.—Huggo Roy Bean is nearly killed by the inhabitants of a badlands bar and brothel. He returns to take vengeance only to find that he is the new symbol of law and order in the area. He becomes the Judge and dispenses justice until time and events pass him by.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>"

Two researchers have come to San Francisco to compete for a research grant in music. One seems a bit distracted, and that's before he meets her: a strange woman who seems to have devoted her life to confusing and embarrassing him. At the same time, a woman has her jewels stolen and a government whistle-blower arrives with his stolen top-secret papers. All, of course, have the same style and color overnight bag.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> This is the comic tale of four identical pieces of red plaid luggage and one San Francisco hotel, in the spirit of Howard Hawks but made by Peter Bogdanovich. One bag contains secret government files, another has expensive jewels, and a third has igneous rocks. It is unclear what is in the fourth bag, carried by the would-be erudite Judy Maxwell, but all four bags end up at the Hotel Bristol. Judy has a yen for food and Dr. Howard Bannister, and lacks an ""off"" button. Dr. Bannister (deliciously deadpan and hunky Ryan O'Neal) has a yen for igneous rock formations. When all four bags are hopelessly mixed up and Howard's prim, bossy fiancee Eunice (unforgettably played by Madeline Kahn) is kidnapped, only the long arm of the law (i.e. the judiciary) can make sense of the chaos. There are no paleontologists or tigers, but there are madcap antics, the obligatory San Francisco chase scenes, and clever one-liners.—LA-Lawyer When Howard Bannister travels to San Francisco with his fiancée to compete for a musicology research grant, he runs into a wild, unpredictable college dropout who brings ""havoc and chaos everywhere (she) goes.""

It's love at first sight for Judy, who does whatever she can to insinuate herself into Howard's life. Further complications ensue as Howard, Judy, wealthy Mrs. Van Hoskins and reporter Mr. Smith - the latter two who are staying at the same hotel as Howard - all have the identical red plaid overnight bag respectively carrying Howard's igneous rocks, Judy's clothes, Mrs. Van Hoskins' jewels and top secret government documents, the latter two which are eyed by others who are trying to get their hands on the contents.—Huggo"

Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068408/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a futuristic world that has embraced ape slavery, Caesar, the son of the late simians Cornelius and Zira, surfaces after almost twenty years of hiding out from the authorities, and prepares for a slave revolt against humanity. Cornelius and Zira's son Caesar leads apes to revolution in this installment of the apes saga. Dogs and cats have been wiped out by a plague and now apes are household pets that are treated like slaves. Caesar has the intelligence to fight this oppression.—Josh Pasnak <chainsaw@intouch.bc.ca> Fourth feature in the simian series has apes domesticated and turned into work slaves in the near future. Along comes Ceasar, son of Cornelius and Zira who died in the third film, who leads his chimp brothers in rebellion against the human oppressors, thus creating the time loop that leads to the first film.—Humberto Amador In 1983 (several years after the end of 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes'), an interstellar disease kills the world's cats and dogs, leaving humans with no pet animals. To replace them, humans began keeping monkeys and apes as household pets. In time, humans notice the apes' capacity to learn and adapt; thus they train them to perform menial household tasks. By 1991, the former United States of America and most of the North American continent has become an oppressive and fascist police superstate culture of uniformed classes and castes, based upon ape slave labor. The different apes are divided into similar caste systems; gorillas wear red jumpsuits; chimpanzees wear green jumpsuits; and orangutans wear orange jumpsuits.In the opening scene, Armando (Ricardo Montalbán) and Caesar (Roddy McDowall), a young chimpanzee horseback rider in Armando's circus, visit a large city to distribute flyers advertising the circus' arrival to town. Armando warns the chimpanzee to be careful; should anyone learn his identity as the child of the late Cornelius and Zira, it would mean their deaths. Walking the streets, they see apes cleaning streets, delivering packages, et cetera, and are shocked by what is done to disobedient apes. Seeing an ape being beaten and drugged by black-uniformed neo-Gestapo police units, Caesar shouts: ""Lousy human bastards!"". Quickly, Armando takes responsibility for the exclamation, explaining to the policemen that it was he who shouted, not his chimpanzee. The surrounding crowd become agitated, and Caesar runs away.Hiding in a stairway, Armando says he will go to the authorities and settle the matter by bluffing. Meantime, Caesar must hide among his own kind (in a cage of orangutans from Borneo), and soon finds himself being trained for slavery through violent conditioning. He then is sold at auction to the neo-Fascist Governor Breck (Don Murray). Gov. Breck allows the ape to name himself by randomly pointing to a word in a book handed to him and the chimpanzee's finger rests upon the name Caesar, as if by chance (but the audience knows that the ape can read and searched for the name). Caesar is then put to work by Gov. Breck's chief aide, the African-American MacDonald (Hari Rhodes), who sympathizes with the apes to the thinly veiled disgust of his boss, and eventually deduces Casear's true identity.Meanwhile, Armando is being interrogated by Inspector Kolp (Severn Darden), who suspects his ""circus ape"" is the child of the two civilized apes from the future back in 1973. Kolp's assistant puts Armando under an authenticator machine that psychologically forces people to be truthful. Rather than confessing, Armando fights the guards and commits suicide by jumping to his death through a window. Learning of the death of the only human he loved, Caesar loses faith in human kindness and begins plotting a simian rebellion.Secretly, Caesar teaches the combat arts to the other apes and has them gather weapons. Meanwhile, Gov. Breck learns from Inspector Kolp that the manifest of the vessel that delivered Caesar lists no chimpanzees. Suspecting Caesar is the ape the secret police are hunting, Breck's men arrest Caesar and electrically torture him until he speaks, thus betraying his identity. Hearing the confession, Breck orders Caesar's immediate death. Caesar survives his execution because MacDonald, feigning over-sensitivity to torture, reduces the electrical power of the machine. Once Gov. Breck leaves, Caesar kills the torturer and escapes.Caesar leads an ape revolt against Ape Management and a violent and climatic 25-minute battle begins. The apes are victorious after killing most of the riot police. After bursting into Gov. Breck's command post and killing most of the personnel, Caesar has Breck marched out to be executed in the courtyard. MacDonald appeals to Caesar's humanity to show mercy to his former persecutor. Caesar ignores him, and in a rage declares:""Where there is fire, there is smoke. And in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch, and conspire, and plot, and plan for the inevitable day of Man's downfall. The day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble! When the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity! And we will build our own cities, in which there will be no place for humans except to serve our ends! And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! And that day is upon you NOW!""However, as the apes raise their rifles to beat Breck to death, Lisa (Natalie Trundy), Caesar's beloved and later wife, voices her objection; ""NO!"" other than Caesar, she is the first ape to speak. Caesar reconsiders and orders the apes to lower their weapons, saying:""But now... now we will put away our hatred. Now we will put down our weapons. We have passed through the night of the fires, and those who were our masters are now our servants. And we, who are not human, can afford to be humane. Destiny is the will of God, and if it is mans destiny to be dominated, it is Gods will that he be dominated with compassion, and understanding. So, cast out your vengeance. Tonight, we have seen the birth of the planet of the apes!""The final shot shows Caesar standing among all his fellow gorillas, chimpanzees, and other apes among the burning buildings as the city burns to the ground."

He takes pictures of the man's apartment and scrutinizes his information at home for the perfect way to kill him. He breaks into the man's apartment and prepares it for the hit by placing a malleable explosive in a book in the man's bedroom rigging the gas oven to leak and drugging his tea. From the facing apartment, he watches the target drink his tea, and get drowsy, He waits until later that night, before shooting the book in the bedroom with a sniper rifle, causing a big and fatal explosion.Bishop next meets with Harry McKenna, (Keenan Wynn) a longtime friend of his father. Harry explains the the Organization says that Harry broke ""the agreement"" and won't take his calls any longer. He would like Bishop to talk to them on his behalf. Bishop doesn't see what difference that will make, but Harry explains that the reverence they had for Bishop's father, might make them more agreeable. Over a drink, Harry reminds Bishop of a story about Harry, Bishop's father and Bishop as a boy on a fishing trip. Bishop had fallen overboard and couldn't swim, which prompted his father to say ""he'll learn"" not moving a muscle to help him. Harry recalls that he himself had to reach out and pull him back into the boat. Harry: Your old man, he laughed like hell!
Bishop: That was a long time ago.
Their visit is interrupted by Harry's son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent) who shows up looking for money. Harry initially gives him a hard time before handing him the $1,000.00 he wants and Steve remarks, ""My father gets uptight when I ask him for money he steals from other people."" Harry apologizes for his son's manner and asks Bishop to call when he knows something.Bishop gets a delivery which is the contract on Harry. He pins up all of Harry's personal information and plans out the hit. He scouts a remote beach location and tells Harry the Organization has asked him to meet there. When they arrive, Bishop drives up to a hill overlooking Harry on the beach. He takes shots at Harry from his hidden location and then acts as if he's discovered a sniper and is attempting to help Harry get away. Harry runs to the car, exhausted and Bishop approaches him gun in hand revealing his intention. Bishop then suffocates Harry in the car.Bishop visits a girl (Jill Ireland) who role plays a rather mundane drama with him, playing his neglected girlfriend, including reading a letter she wrote, requiring him to comfort her. After they spend the night together, she announces that the letter was difficult and will cost him another hundred. He agrees, remarking that the letter was a good touch, recommending something like it for next time.Bishop runs into Steve again at Harry's funeral. Steve isn't too bothered by his father's death, describing his father to Bishop as ""Harry McKenna, fixer extraordinaire, pusher, pimp, thief, arsonist..."" Bishop asks, ""You liked him a lot?"" Bishop tells Steve that Harry had worked for his father years ago. Steve realizes that this means Bishop's father was in the Organization and he asks Bishop if he's in himself, surmising that he is although Bishop tries to change the subject, reminding him to pay attention to the funeral. When Bishop remarks on Steve being sure of himself he responds ""I live in my mind, Mr. Bishop."" Bishop: ""Sounds like something I read someplace.
Steve: And so do you.Bishop leaves the service and Steve asks him for a ride home. Bishop agrees and finds that Harry's (now Steve's) house is full of Steve's friends having a party. Wading through the crowd, Steve tells Bishop, ""My father never really liked my friends, and I'm not so sure I do either."" Steve gets a phone call from a girlfriend, Louise, threatening to kill herself. He asks Bishop if he'll come along to visit Louise. They find Louise with razor blades, preparing to slit her wrists. Steve makes a show of not caring and Louise cuts one of her wrists to prove she will, still getting no reaction from Steve or Bishop, other than Bishop telling her how long it will take her to die based on her weight. Louise insists that Steve will stop her before she dies, but Steve says ""Listen, if you don't care anything about your life, then why should I?"" Steve throws her some car keys and tells her she might live if she heads to the Sheriff's station in Malibu right away.Discussing the situation, and the idea of watching someone die, Bishop he tells Steve ""It just means you have your own rule book.""
Steve: I can dig that.
Bishop: It takes a very special kind of person to pick up the tab for that kind of living. You say you dig it, but you're talking about something you really know nothing about.
Steve: And you do?
Bishop: Do I?Bishop attends to his routines including martial arts, and knife throwing as well as talking a lot of pills. Visiting an aquarium he passes out, and wakes up in the hospital. The Doctor at the hospital recommends he see his own doctor, and says it sounds like he's experiencing ""Acute Anxiety Reaction"" adding that if it isn't that, he may want to try a psychiatrist.He wakes up the next morning to find Steve parked outside his house. Steve is impressed with his place and Bishop explains he inherited a lot. Steve tries to convince him to let him in on his ""action"" Bishop takes Steve out in a plane, letting go of the controls and forcing Steve to take over, which he quickly does. At a bar later, Bishop explains that his father was a ""Judge"" who had the final word settling Organization disputes,until someone didn't like a decision and put a contract out on him, when Bishop was sill in school. Steve shares that his father never let him in on anything, although he wanted to know the business. Bishop lets him witness a karate match which turns pretty brutal. Steve remarks ""He practically murdered that guy."" and Bishop answers ""Murder is only killing without a license and everybody kills, governments, the military, the police.""
Steve: Do you think Yamato's a killer?
Bishop: He's a killer that doesn't kill. It's funny. No, for him, the rules are important.
Steve: That's your expert opinion?
Bishop: That's my opinion.
Steve points out that Bishop is being evasive about giving real answers. Bishop reminds him that he better be sure he wants the answers he's asking for. He asks Steve what he knows about the term ""Mechanic"" and Steve tells him it can be used as synonymous with hit man. Bishop reveals that's what he is and tells Steve that sometimes he could use a back up. Steve asks, ""You do this for money?""
Bishop: Money is paid, but that's not the motive. It has to do with standing outside of it all, on your own.
He offers to teach Steve all he can, and confirming he's in, Steve says ""You've got a partner Mr. Bishop."" Bishop corrects him, ""Associate.""Steve demonstrates an aptitude for the work and they start training for real. Going through a museum Bishop tells Steve ""There are killers and there are killers, to tell you the truth they all have a different book of rules. To get away with it depends on the book of rules you have in your pocket at the time, your own country, somebody else's country, or your own personal book of rules. All this (waves at the museum figures) heroes, half of them are killers. Napoleon was one you know, Pancho Villa, Genghis Khan, and the we have our own domestic brand, like Billy the Kid, Jesse James and John Dillinger. Yeah, they're about as famous as our own honest to goodness heroes.""Bishop gets an assignment to kill three men, who are in the habit of riding around on dirtbikes, but live behind heavy security with constant guards on watch. Bishop includes Steve in the job, including the surveillance. Bishop surprises Steve by watching one of the men in a conversation via binoculars and reading their lips to discover a ""Chicken Licken"" truck set to arrive at the guarded compound for a delivery. Bishop finds vats of acid at a plating plant to dump the bodies afterwards. Steve and Bishop take the Chicken Licken truck and enter the compound. The hit is messy though and one of the men escapes forcing Bishop to chase the man on a dirtbike. Although the man ends up dead, the chase causes quite a commotion running through backyard parties and causing car accidents.Bishop is called to meet with one of the Organization heads. He takes a plane to meet a chauffeured car which brings him to the estate. The man (Frank DeKova) is paining a leopard which he has tied in the yard. The man comments that the last job was very messy and asks about Harry McKenna's son and how he's involved in things. Bishop takes exception at the thought of having to ask permission. The man reminds him that there are rules in place which ensure the Organization survives, implying that Bishop has broken a rule.
He gives Bishop a new assignment saying it has to be done fast.
Bishop: I'll handle it the way I always do.
Man: There may not be time enough for that. The word is he's getting ready to talk to some people. The problem is considerable. Bishop: I'm not some wild Cleveland shooter. I don't cowboy!
Man: If he talks, things could get complicated, sloppy. That would disturb a lot of us. It's not really open to discussion, Mr. Bishop. This business of McKenna's son has upset a few of our associates.
The man tells him that the target is in Naples, where they have him a room already.Bishop gets home and heads to Steve's place. Finding Steve is out, he looks around and finds that Steve has taken a contract to kill him. He puts the papers back and goes home. When Steve shows up at Bishop's house later, he fills him in on the Naples job, telling him they want it ""Cowboyed"" He also tells Steve that he is nevertheless going to do it the way he's always done.They head to Naples and start watching the target, discovering that the man is very unpredictable, rarely doing the same thing twice, with the exception of returning to his boat. Bishop shares a local wine with Steve, explaining that it doesn't travel well and they don't export it. He reminds Steve to savor it and the time he has. He also gives Steve advice about planning hits, telling him, ""You've got to be dead sure, or dead."" Bishop tells Steve he'll pick up some scuba gear and they'll use it to get on the boat undetected to kill the target. They succeed and Bishop plans an explosive before they leave. As they get off the boat, some Organization men show up after them in speedboats. They watch as the men get blown up with the boat. Steve asks who the men are and Bishop explains that they're Organization men, after him because he broke a rule by not asking them to start training him. More men show up soon, leading to a car chase. Bishop blows up a car chasing them and then sends an exploding car into a roadblock set for him, and pushes the last pursuing car off the mountain road with a bulldozer he finds on the side of the road.Back at their room, Steve offers Bishop a glass of the local wine he likes. Steve watches with interest as Bishop has a sip. Bishop insects the glass himself suspiciously before picking up his bag to go, only to double over in pain. Steve says ""Brucine! You'll be dead in a few minutes. Listen, you'll really appreciate this. This stuff is absolutely clear when it's in solution. I just coated the inside of the glass with it and let it dry. When the wine hit it it went right back into solution. No trace. Looks just like a heart attack."" Bishop keeps struggling on the ground in agony. Steve continues ""You said every man has his jelly spot. Yours was you just couldn't cut it alone.""
Bishop: Was it because of your father?
Steve: You killed him? I thought he just died. You see? There you are. They told you who to hit. Kept the whole idea from being what we talked about. You needed a license, their license. I'm gonna pick my own mark, hit when I want. Just like you said, standing outside. See Naples and die.""Steve heads to Bishop's place, as if making it his own. He picks up the ball Bishop would squeeze to strengthen his fingers and then gets into his car and finds a note taped to his rear view mirror. We hear Bishop reading it to him "" Steve, if you read this it means I didn't make it back. It also means you've broken a filament controlling a thirteen second delay trigger. End of game. Bang, you're dead."""
Deliverance,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068473/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Intent on seeing the Cahulawassee River before it's dammed and turned into a lake, outdoor fanatic Lewis Medlock takes his friends on a canoeing trip they'll never forget into the dangerous American back-country. The Cahulawassee River valley in Northern Georgia is one of the last natural pristine areas of the state, which will soon change with the imminent building of a dam on the river, which in turn will flood much of the surrounding land. As such, four Atlanta city dwellers, alpha male Lewis Medlock, Ed Gentry, Bobby Trippe, and Drew Ballinger, decide to take a multi-day canoe trip on the river, with only Lewis and Ed having experience in outdoor life. They know going in that the area is isolated. Their relatively peaceful trip takes a turn for the worse halfway through with river rapids and unwelcoming locals. The four need to battle their way out of the valley and are asked to do things they never thought possible within themselves.—Huggo Four Atlanta businessmen embark on a canoeing trip through a river in deep Georgia. The reason behind their trip is that the local power company is planning to dam the river, making it into a giant lake and so this will be the last time they will get to see the river in it's natural state. The men come across some hostile locals and rough water and things take a turn for the worse and the four men struggle to survive in the American wilderness.—blazesnakes9 They left their troubles at the office. Left the wives and kids behind. Four men bound for the wilderness. It was the weekend they hoped for, a great adventure, without their golf clubs. Soon enough, the trip becomes a nightmare when they run into creepy rednecks, God's forgotten creatures. Based on the novel by James Dickey, it's a thriller with drama, a story of survival, a hellish nightmare. The weekend they should have brought their golf clubs.—Alex On a weekend canoeing trip down a river in the Georgia back country, four urban businessmen enter a nightmare in which both nature and mankind conspire to send them through a crucible of danger and degradation in which their lives and perhaps even their souls are put at horrendous risk.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> Atlanta businessmen Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (Jon Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty), and Drew (Ronny Cox) decide to canoe down the fictional Cahulawassee River in the remote Georgia wilderness, expecting to have fun and see the glory of nature before the river valley is flooded over by the upcoming construction of a dam and lake. Lewis, an experienced outdoors-man, is the de facto leader. Ed is also a veteran of several trips but lacks Lewis' machismo. Bobby and Drew are canoeing novices.From the start, it is clear the four are aliens in this unknown locale. The redneck locals are crude, crass, uneducated, unsophisticated and unimpressed with the presence of outsiders. Drew briefly connects with a local mentally-challenged banjo-playing boy by joining him in an impromptu bluegrass jam (the 'Dueling Banjos'). But when the song ends, the boy turns away without saying anything, refusing Drew's handshake. The four ""city boys"", as they are called by one of the unfriendly locals, exhibit a slightly condescending attitude toward the locals; Bobby, in particular, is patronizing toward them. Nevertheless, Lewis manages to negotiate with a family of local mechanics to drive their vehicles to a town downriver, where they will pick them up in three days. Afterward, the four get into their two canoes, Lewis with Bobby and Ed with Drew, and paddle off.The men spend the day canoeing down the river and encounter some rapids and rough water before camping by the riverside at night. Shortly before they retire for the night, Lewis tells the others to be quiet and disappears into the dark woods to investigate a sound he heard. He returns a few minutes later and says that he didn't find anything. When asked whether he heard ""something or someone,"" he tells them he doesn't know.The next morning, Ed wakes first, and heads into the woods with his hunting bow. He sees a deer, experiencing ""buck fever"", unable to keep his aim straight and kill the deer. He fires and misses. He returns as the others are finishing breakfast and loading the canoes. Lewis tells Ed to take Bobby and they get away first. Lewis says that he and Drew will catch up.After a while, Bobby and Ed pull off to the side to wait, and encounter a pair of unkempt hillbillies emerging from the woods; one toothless (Herbert 'Cowboy Coward), and one wielding a shotgun (Bill McKinney). The hillbillies are mildly hostile at first. Bobby speculates that they have a whiskey still hidden in the woods and amicably offers to buy some, but the hillbillies immediately become angry, and are not moved by Bobby's sarcastic comment. The two hillbillies tie Ed to a tree with his belt around his throat and force Bobby at gunpoint to strip naked. The lead hillbilly chases after and physically harasses Bobby as he tries to escape. Bobby's ear is twisted to bring him to his hands and knees, and he is then ordered to ""squeal like a pig"". Ed is guarded by the toothless hillbilly, helpless as the other hillbilly violently sodomizes Bobby.The second hillbilly comments on Ed's ""pretty mouth"" and releases Ed and tells him to get on his knees. Ed notices Lewis sneaking up behind them through the trees with an arrow drawn. Lewis shoots and kills Bobby's rapist with an arrow through his back, as the toothless hillbilly is disarmed by Ed and quickly escapes into the woods. Lewis and Drew begin to argue with each other about whether to inform the authorities. While Drew wants to find a phone to call the police to report this, Lewis argues that they all would be arrested and not receive a fair trial, as he claims that the entire local hillbilly population are related to one another. They would be put on trial in a small town courthouse and that the judge and entire jury would be comprised of ""the dead man's friends and relatives"". Likewise, Bobby does not want the story of his rape to become public. Lewis tells them that since the entire area will be flooded by a lake soon, the body would never be found, and that the escaped hillbilly could not possibly risk informing the police on them, since he had participated in the assault. Lewis suggests a democratic vote and Ed and Bobby side with Lewis and the recommendation to bury the dead hillbilly's body and continue as though nothing had happened. When the valley is flooded, no one will ever find the body. During the grave digging, Drew is obviously upset with the decision.After having buried the body, the four make a run for it downriver. Soon, disaster strikes as the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. In the lead canoe, Ed repeatedly asks Drew to don his life jacket, but an unnerved Drew ignores him without a word of explanation. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids, a faint gunshot is heard and Drew falls forward into the river.After Drew disappears into the river, Ed loses control of his canoe and both canoes collide on the rocks, spilling Lewis, Bobby, and Ed into the river. Ed and Drew's wooden canoe breaks in half while Lewis and Bobby's metal canoe remains intact. The three tumble down the river through the rapids and a water fall. Lewis breaks his right femur and the two others are washed ashore alongside him in a gorge under a massive cliff. The badly-injured Lewis believes the toothless hillbilly shot Drew and is now stalking them.Later that night, under cover of darkness, Ed climbs the nearby rock face in order to dispatch the suspected shooter using his bow, while Bobby stays behind to look after Lewis. Ed reaches the top and hides out until the next morning, when he sees a man standing on the cliff holding a rifle, looking down into the gorge where Lewis and Bobby are hiding. The man appears to be the hillbilly that escaped through the woods.Ed, despite being a champion archer, again freezes in spite of his clear shot. The man notices Ed and fires his rifle as Ed clumsily releases his arrow. Ed falls to the ground in a panic and accidentally stabs himself with another of his arrows. The man stumbles toward Ed and is about to kill him when he drops his rifle and collapses, revealing Ed's arrow protruding through the back of his neck (Ed had in fact hit him after all). Ed suddenly remembers that the hillbilly who tried to assault him had no front teeth, but upon initial examination, this man appears to have all his teeth, but upon closer examination, Ed discovers that his victim has a partial, movable plate for his front teeth.Ed lowers the dead body down the cliff with a rope and climbs down after it. His rope breaks and he and the dead body fall into the river. Ed swims ashore and meets with Bobby and Lewis. Ed asks more than once if Bobby is certain the dead man is the same toothless hillbilly as the one they confronted earlier. Clearly irritated and not completely sure himself, Ed snaps at Bobby and asks him to confirm the dead man's identity. Bobby does not answer.Ed and Bobby weigh the dead hillbilly down with stones and drop him into the river and then set out with the injured Lewis in the surviving canoe. A little later, they come upon Drew's grotesquely-contorted corpse stuck on a dead-fall in the river. After being unable to find any definite gunshot wound on the dead Drew (save for a deep gash on his forehead which may or may not be a graze from a bullet), they also weigh the body down with rocks and release it into the river. Ed points out that they don't want the authorities examining Drew's body and possibly discovering a gunshot wound. Ed gives a short eulogy and sinks Drew into the river to ensure that he will never be found. With Lewis injured and Drew dead, Ed becomes the leader, trying to ensure their story is consistent, knowing the authorities will investigate.After canoeing through more rapids, Ed, Bobby, and Lewis finally reach their destination, the town of Aintry, which will soon be submerged by the river and is currently being evacuated. They call the police and take the injured Lewis to the local hospital while Sheriff Bullard (played by the author James Dickie in a cameo appearance) arrives to investigate the incident. One of the deputies, Arthur Queen, has a missing brother-in-law (ostensibly one of the hillbillies Lewis and Ed killed) and is highly suspicious of the ""city boys"" version of events. Ed and Bobby visit Lewis' hospital room to make sure Lewis' version of events is consistent with theirs. While they are uncertain whether the apparently unconscious Lewis understands them, as the doctors enter, Lewis appears to awaken, gives Ed and Bobby a knowing wink, and says he remembers nothing. Ed and Bobby then spend the night at a local boarding house and have an uneventful dinner with the local tenants who tell them that they are leaving town soon because of the dam-lake project.Another day or two later, Ed and Bobby pack up their vehicles outside the boarding house and they prepare to pick Lewis up from the hospital and drive home. Just then, Sheriff Bullard suddenly appears and asks Ed why there were four life jackets found in the canoe when only he, Lewis, and Bobby came out of the river. Stammering, Bobby suggests there may have been an extra one. But Ed intervenes and says 'no', that Drew was not wearing his life jacket when he fell into the river and he does not know why. The sheriff also tells them that his men found the remains of one of the canoes above the last set of rapids where the guys claim that Drew drowned, plus no trace of Drew's body has been found along the river. Ed continues to feign ignorance, claiming not to know anything as well as claiming not to have seen anyone else in the area.While the Sheriff remains suspicious, but having no evidence as to what did happen he simply tells Ed: ""Don't ever do nothing' like this again. Don't ever come back up here. I don't ever wanna see you or your friends again! I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful,"" to which Ed readily agrees and drives away with Bobby.The men vow to keep their story a secret for the rest of their lives. In the final scene, Ed awakes screaming from a nightmare in which a dead man's hand rises from the lake."
1776,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068156/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A musical retelling of the American Revolution's political struggle in the Continental Congress to declare independence. The film version of the Broadway musical comedy of the same name. In the days leading up to July 4, 1776, Continental Congressmen John Adams and Benjamin Franklin coerce Thomas Jefferson into writing the Declaration of Independence as a delaying tactic as they try to persuade the American colonies to support a resolution on independence. As George Washington sends depressing messages describing one military disaster after another, the businessmen, landowners and slave holders in Congress all stand in the way of the Declaration, and a single ""nay"" vote will forever end the question of independence. Large portions of spoken and sung dialog are taken directly from the letters and memoirs of the actual participants.—Dave Heston <heston@iName.com> Despite or because of the state of the Revolutionary War led by General George Washington, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, has long skirted the issue of independence from Great Britain, much to the chagrin of its chief proponents, Massachusetts Congressman John Adams and Pennsylvania Congressman Dr. Benjamin Franklin. Adams knows that much of the debate is against him as a person, many who see him as being obnoxious and a blow-hard. He decides a more judicious approach may be to work behind the scenes rather than be front and center in the fight as he has been. On June 7, 1776, Adams gets Virginia Congressman Richard Henry Lee to propose a motion in Congress to debate the issue, which finally passes. However when the vote for independence finally looks like it will pass, its chief opponent, Pennsylvania Congressman John Dickinson, manages to pass a motion that any vote for independence needs to be unanimous. As a delay tactic, Adams initiates a successful motion to postpone the vote for three weeks to July 2, 1776 until they can vote on the actual text for a declaration of independence - his assertion is how can they vote on something that does not exist. Adams and Franklin talk a reluctant Virginia Congressman Thomas Jefferson to be the one to draft the document. Jefferson's reluctance is that he has other more personal issues on his mind. As Jefferson takes to his writing duties, Adams and Franklin and their supporters know they only have three weeks to convince the six opposing colonies to support independence. As Franklin states, it may take some improvisation and some compromise.—Huggo On the evening of May 8, 1776, in Philadelphia, as the Second Continental Congress proceeds with its business. John Adams, the widely disliked delegate from Massachusetts, is frustrated, because none of his proposals on independence have been debated on by congress. The other delegates, implore him to ('Sit Down, John')Adams' response is that Congress has done nothing for the last year. He goes outside and in song ('Piddle, Twiddle, and Resolve'), he reads the latest missive from his loving wife Abigail, who, their home in Braintree, Massachusetts, appears in his imagination. He asks if she and the other women are making saltpeter for the war effort but she ignores that and states the women have a more urgent problem: no straight pins. They pledge their love to each other in song ('Till Then').The next day, Adams finds delegate Benjamin Franklin outside. Adams bemoans the failure of his arguments for independence. Franklin suggests that, a resolution for independence would have more success if proposed by someone else. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia enters on horseback, having been summoned by Franklin. The cocky Lee crows that he is the best man to propose the resolution. Adams has reservations, but Lee is convinced he cannot fail, as a member of the oldest and most glorious family in America ('The Lees of Old Virginia') He is prepared to ask the Virginia House of Burgesses to authorize him to offer a pro-independence resolution.On June 7, 1776, Franklin and Adams enter, and the delegates, along with the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, take their places. Hancock gavels the 380th meeting of the Congress to order.The entire New Jersey delegation is absent. Thomas Jefferson, a young delegate from Virginia, announces that he is leaving for Virginia that night to visit his wife. Soon after Hancock opens the floor to new resolutions, Richard Henry Lee canters into the chamber, having finally returned from Virginia. Lee reads his resolution, but John Dickinson of Pennsylvania moves to indefinitely postpone the question of independence. A vote is taken. Six colonies vote in favor of debate. Five vote to postpone indefinitely and thus kill the proposal.The New Jersey delegate arrives, and the vote now stands at six for independence and six against (with New York abstaining ""courteously""), and Adams reminds Hancock (who supports independence) of his privilege as president to break all ties. Dickinson then moves that any vote for independence must pass unanimously on the grounds that ""no colony may be torn from its mother country without its own consent."" The vote produces the same tie, which Hancock breaks by unexpectedly voting for unanimity (prompting an angry outburst from Adams). He reasons that without unanimity, any colony voting against independence would be forced to fight on England's side, setting brother against brother.Adams, thinking fast, calls for a postponement of the vote on independence, expressing the need for a declaration defining the reasons for independence. Franklin seconds Adams, but when asked why such a declaration should be written, both are lost for words until Thomas Jefferson provides them himself: ""to place before mankind the common sense of the subject, in terms so plain and firm as to command their assent."" The vote on postponement is called, producing yet another tie, with New York abstaining ""courteously"" yet again. Hancock breaks the tie by voting in favor of postponement. He appoints a committee of Adams, Franklin, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert Livingston of New York, and Jefferson to draft the declaration. Hancock adjourns the session over Jefferson's complaints that he must go home to his wife.The Committee of Five argues about who should write the declaration ('But, Mr. Adams'). Adams declines Franklin's suggestion that he do so. Adams asks each of the others, in turn, to be the drafter, but each demurs: Franklin argues that he is not a political writer, only a satirist; Sherman claims that he is not a writer at all, but ""a simple cobbler from Connecticut""; and Livingston must return to New York to celebrate the birth of his son.All eyes then turn to Jefferson. Jefferson tries to wriggle out of the responsibility, pleading that he has not seen his wife in six months. Adams, unmoved by Jefferson's arguments (as he, too, misses his own wife), quotes a passage of Jefferson's Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, bluntly telling Jefferson that he is the best writer in Congress. Jefferson accepts the duty of drafting the document.A week later, Adams and Franklin visit Jefferson to see how the work is coming along. Jefferson has spent the week moping, prompting a sharp rebuke by Adams, which is flatly rebuffed by Jefferson. Finally, Jefferson is brightened when his beloved wife Martha enters (Adams has sent for her). The two older gentlemen leave the young lovers in peace. Adams, alone, again exchanges letters with his wife Abigail. They pledge each other to be eternally ('Yours, Yours, Yours'). Martha finally appears when Franklin and Adams return the next morning, and the two gentlemen ask her how a man as silent as Jefferson won a woman as lovely as she. She tells them that she loves him ('He Plays the Violin').On June 22, 1776, Congress has reconvened. By now, Adams is worrying and begins trying to win over some of the states, sending Thomas McKean to try to convince his Delaware colleague George Read and Franklin to convince James Wilson of Pennsylvania, while himself trying to convince Samuel Chase of Maryland.The remaining delegates in favor of independence also leave the chamber. Alone with his fellow conservatives for the first time, Dickinson leads them in a minuet, singing of their desire to hold onto their wealth and remain ('Cool, Cool Considerate Men'). During their dance/song, another dispatch comes from George Washington warning them of British advances on Philadelphia; however these warnings fall on deaf ears.After the dance number, the remaining delegates depart, leaving Andrew McNair (the custodian), the courier, and a workman in the chamber. The workman asks the courier if he has seen any fighting and the courier replies that his two closest friends were killed on the same day at Lexington. He describes the final thoughts of a dying young man as his mother searches for his body ('Momma, Look Sharp').Jefferson is outside the chamber as Mr. Thomson, the secretary, reads the declaration to Congress. Adams and Franklin meet him delightedly: an exhibition of shooting by the Continental Army has convinced Samuel Chase, and Maryland will vote in favor of independence. They congratulate Jefferson on the excellence of the document, and Franklin compares the creation of this new country to an egg ('The Egg'). This leads the trio to debate which bird is breaking out of its metaphorical shell and would best represent America. Franklin tries to coax them into choosing the turkey, but the three settle on the eagle, as insisted upon by Adams.On June 28, 1776, Hancock asks if there are any alterations to be offered to the Declaration of Independence, leading many delegates to voice suggestions. Jefferson acquiesces to each recommendation, much to Adams's consternation, until Dickinson demands the removal of a phrase calling the King a tyrant. Jefferson refuses, stating that ""the King is a tyrant whether we say so or not. We might as well say so."" When Thomson comments that he has already scratched the word out, Jefferson orders him to ""scratch it back in."" When one delegate wants references to Parliament removed for fear of offending possible friends in that body, an exasperated Adams exclaims ""This is a revolution, damn it! We're going to have to offend somebody!""Edward Rutledge of South Carolina objects to a clause in the Declaration condemning the slave trade, accusing the northern colonies of hypocrisy and telling them that the prosperity of the North depends on the Triangle Trade ('Molasses to Rum') to slaves as well. When this clause is not removed, the delegates of the Carolinas and Georgia walk out of Congress. The resolve of the other delegates is broken, and most of them also leave. Franklin tells Adams that the slavery clause must go; when Adams quarrels with him, Franklin angrily reminds Adams that ""the issue here is independence!"" and berates Adams for jeopardizing the cause. Adams' faith in himself is shaken, and only encouragement from Abigail (and the delivery of kegs of saltpeter from her and other Massachusetts ladies) bolsters his commitment ('Compliments').Re-reading the dispatch from Washington, Adams, now alone in the chamber, echoes his words in song ('Is Anybody There?') Discouraged but determined, Adams declares his vision of his new country: ""Through all the gloom, through all the doom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory!"" Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia, unexpectedly returns to the chamber. He tells Adams ""In trying to resolve my dilemma I remembered something I'd once read, 'that a representative owes the People not only his industry, but his judgment, and he betrays them if he sacrifices it to their opinion.' It was written by Edmund Burke, a member of the British Parliament."" Hall then walks over to the tally board and changes Georgia's vote from ""nay"" to ""yea"".It is now July 2, 1776. The delegates slowly return to the chamber, including Caesar Rodney of Delaware, who had earlier left Congress due to poor health. Hancock calls for the vote on the Lee Resolution. Thomson calls on each delegation for its vote. Pennsylvania passes on the first call, but the rest of the northern and middle colonies (save New York, which, with some self-disgust, again abstains ""courteously"") vote ""yea"". When the vote reaches South Carolina, Rutledge again demands the removal of the slavery clause as the condition of the ""yea"" votes from the Carolinas. Franklin pleads with Adams to remove the clause (""First things first, John ... Independence. America. If we don't secure that, what difference will the rest make?"") and Adams turns to Jefferson. Jefferson reluctantly crosses the chamber and scratches out the clause himself. Rutledge and the Carolinas vote ""yea"", as does Georgia.Pennsylvania's vote, which is the last vote needed to obtain the required unanimous approval, is called again, Dickinson declares that ""Pennsylvania votes..."", only to be stopped by Franklin who asks Hancock to poll the members of the delegation individually. Franklin votes ""yea"" and Dickinson ""nay"", leaving the swing vote to Wilson, who normally adheres to Dickinson. Seeing his hesitancy, Dickinson tries to entice him: ""Come now, James ... the issue is clear."" Franklin remarks that ""most issues are clear when someone else has to decide them"", and Adams mercilessly adds that ""it would be a pity for a man (Wilson) who has handed down hundreds of wise decisions from the bench to be remembered for the one unwise decision he made in Congress."" Wilson doesn't want to be remembered as ""the man who prevented American independence"" and votes ""yea"". The motion is passed.The next day on July 3, Hancock suggests that no man be allowed to sit in Congress without affixing his signature to the Declaration. Dickinson announces that he cannot in good conscience sign such a document and still hopes for reconciliation with England. However, he resolves to join the army to fight for and defend the new nation. Adams leads the Congress in a salute to Dickinson as he leaves the chamber.The next day, Hancock leads the delegates in signing the Declaration, but is interrupted by the courier with another dispatch from Washington, ""Commander of the Army of the United Colonies ... of the United States of America."" He reports that preparations for the Battle of New York are under way, but expresses concern about America's badly outnumbered and under-trained troops. Washington's note to Lewis Morris that his estates have been destroyed but that his family has been taken to safety emboldens Morris to state that he will sign the Declaration, despite the lack of instructions from the New York legislature, saying, ""To Hell with New York. I'll sign it anyway."" New York's vote is moved into the ""yea"" column.On the evening of July 4, 1776, McNair rings the Liberty Bell in the background as Thomson calls each of the delegates to sign their names on the Declaration of Independence. The delegates freeze in position as the Liberty Bell rings to a fevered pitch."

Andrew Wyke is a famous and successful author of detective novels. Milo Tindle comes to him with a strange request, that Mr Wyke divorce his wife so that Tindle can marry her. Mr Wyke is not particularly perturbed by this, he and his wife have drifted apart, and he is having an affair with another woman anyway, but uses the meeting and Mr Tindle's request as a chance to play a game, a game with potentially deadly consequences.—grantss Milo Tindle and Andrew Wyke have something in common, Andrew's wife. In an attempt to find a way out of this without costing Andrew a fortune in alimony, he suggests Milo pretend to rob his house and let him claim the insurance on the stolen jewelry. The problem is that they don't really like each other and each cannot avoid the zinger on the other. The plot has many shifts in which the advantage shifts between Milo and Andrew.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In England, the Italian English hairdresser Milo Tindle is invited by the successful writer of detective stories Andrew Wyke to visit his isolated house. The lower class Milo is the lover of Andrew's wife, who is used to have a comfortable life, and he intends to marry her. Andrew proposes Milo to steal his jewelry simulating a burglary. Milo would make a fortune selling the jewels to an intermediary; and Andrew would be reimbursed by the insurance company and would not pay alimony.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Andrew Wyke is a wealthy, unhappily married country squire and writer of detective novels who delights in playing elaborate games. Aware that Milo Tindle, the struggling owner of two hair salons, is having an affair with his wife, Marguerite, Wyke invites him to his country manor house in Wiltshire. Wyke is also having an affair with a girl named Teija and is quite happy to divorce his wife. His main concern is that Tindle, a struggling businessman, will be unable to maintain Marguerite in the lifestyle to which she has become accustomed, and that she'll leave him and return to Wyke.Wyke suggests that Tindle steal some valuable jewelry and sell it in order to live happily with Marguerite, while Wyke will claim the insurance in order to live happily with Teija. When Tindle agrees, Wyke offers him a disguise in case of unexpected visitors and, dressed up as a clown and under Wyke's supervision, Tindle breaks into Wyke's manor house, blows open the safe and obtains the jewels.Wyke then reveals that he has lured Tindle into a trap whereupon he can legally shoot him as an intruder.Wyke's real grievance is that his wife has been having an affair with a working-class boy made good rather than a member of the upper classes like himself (Tindle's Italian origins make him even worse in Wyke's eyes). He looks upon Tindle as nothing more than a gigolo, ""a jumped-up pantry boy who doesn't know his place"". While Tindle begs for mercy, Wyke fires the gun and he falls to the floor.Two days later, in the evening, the eccentric but methodical Inspector Doppler comes to Wyke's house, announcing that he is investigating Tindle's disappearance. At first Wyke denies ever having had anything to do with Tindle but eventually admits to his meeting with him and the ""game"" they played involving the jewels. Wyke states that he did not really kill Tindle but had used blank bullets. His aim was to humiliate the man and teach him that becoming a member of the gentry requires breeding rather than just joining in. He maintains that, after recovering from the shock, Tindle left the house alive.In the course of searching the house, however, Doppler finds traces of blood, evidence of actual bullets being fired into the walls and Tindle's clothes in a wardrobe. Wyke panics at this stage and tries to get away when Doppler pins him down and reveals himself to be none other than Tindle in disguise.Tindle reveals that he wanted revenge for the way Wyke had humiliated him. Wyke expresses admiration for the way it was done, but Tindle is not prepared to leave it at that. For him, the whole charade has become something of a class struggle: Wyke's gentrified world plays games for amusement; but in Tindle's working-class world the game is a daily struggle for survival. He has therefore set up a new game, this time based on reality, and involving a real-life murder.Wyke's murder mystery novels revolve around an upper-class detective, St. John Lord Merridew, who has a ""nose for smelling out evil superior to anything in the force"". Merridew is always solving cases that leave the official detectives baffled. Tindle has always rejected this image, seeing the police as sharp-eyed professionals who know their job.Tindle tells Wyke that he met Wyke's mistress Teija. He killed her, buried her body and planted evidence around the house that would frame Wyke for the crime. Tindle further reveals that the evidence for Teija's murder is set to look as though Wyke had set it in plain sight to provoke the police; to incite them with the impression that Wyke holds a belief that the police are unintelligent and useless and will not see the evidence for what it is.When Wyke phones Teija's roommate Joyce she confirms that Teija's body has been found and that the police are on their way to question him.A distraught Wyke has thirteen minutes to find and destroy the proof linking him to Teija's murder before the police, led by the all-too-real Detective Sergeant Tarrant, arrive. Tindle reads out riddle-clues to the location and nature of the hidden evidence while Wyke frantically runs around the house, interpreting the riddles and finding the items.After Wyke barely manages to dispose of the evidence in time, Tindle reveals that the police are not actually on their way; the whole thing was a set-up. He further reveals that Teija is alive, that he knows she is only marginally involved with Wyke, and that she wholeheartedly approved of Tindle's plan to humiliate the unpleasant older man, who is impotent.Tindle then goes upstairs to retrieve Marguerite's fur coat, a sign that she is moving in with him for good. Wyke takes his revolver out of a nearby drawer. Having been humiliated himself, Wyke informs Tindle that he cannot let him leave and that he intends to kill him, this time for real.Tindle then tells him that he actually did go to the police in order to make a complaint about the earlier incident but that they are unlikely to do anything since they see him as ""some common little git who's been screwing the wife of a local nob and who got what he deserved."" However, if Wyke does kill Tindle, the police will now not believe that Tindle was there to rob the house. Wyke does not believe that Tindle talked to the police and shoots him through the torso.Within a few moments, a police car, with lights flashing, reaches Wyke's front door, and someone begins to knock. Wyke tries to retreat away from the window to avoid being seen, while Tindle, bleeding profusely and barely able to crawl, grabs the switch wired to the entirety of Wyke's large collection of mechanical toys, which come violently to life and attract the attention of the police. With his world coming down, Wyke realizes that he is ruined and the dying Tindle laughs and says mockingly, ""Andrew... be sure and tell them... it was only a bloody game."""

Man of La Mancha,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068909/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The funny story of mad but kind and chivalrous elderly nobleman Don Quixote who, aided by his squire Sancho Panza, fights windmills that are seen as dragons to save prostitute Dulcinea who is seen as a noblewoman. This musical version of Don Quixote is framed by an incident allegedly from the life of its author, Miguel de Cervantes. Don Quixote is the mad, aging nobleman who embarrasses his respectable family by his adventures. Backed by his faithful sidekick Sancho Panza, he duels windmills and defends his perfect lady Dulcinea (who is actually a downtrodden whore named Aldonza).—Reid Gagle In the sixteenth century, Miguel de Cervantes, poet, playwright, and part-time actor, has been arrested, together with his manservant, by the Spanish Inquisition. They are accused of presenting an entertainment offensive to the Inquisition. Inside the huge dungeon into which they have been cast, the other prisoners gang up on Cervantes and his manservant, and begin a mock trial, with the intention of stealing or burning his possessions. Cervantes wishes to desperately save a manuscript he carries with him and stages, with costumes, makeup, and the participation of the other prisoners, an unusual defense--the story of Don Quixote.—Albert Sanchez Moreno <a.moreno@mindspring.com> It is the late sixteenth century. Miguel de Cervantes, an author and part-time actor, has been thrown into a dungeon with his manservant for openly lampooning the Spanish Inquisition. In the dungeon, he is subjected to a mock trial, and the other prisoners confiscate many of Cervantes's belongings, but he seeks to save a mysterious manuscript. Having a trunkful of costumes, props, and makeup at his disposal, he suggests that he be allowed to present an entertainment, with the other prisoners also playing roles. And now the story of Don Quixote begins:Alonso Quijana - not Quijano as in the novel - (Peter OToole), is a country squire somewhere in La Mancha. He is no longer young. He enjoys reading almost incessantly. He eventually goes mad from reading too many books of chivalry (which were in vogue then) and decides to become a knight-errant himself - Don Quixote de la Mancha.Don Quixote, on horseback and in armor, with Sancho Panza (James Coco) riding a donkey at his side, sets out early one morning to find adventures. They proceed along a road on the plains of La Mancha, discoursing about the rules and customs of knight errantry, until, in the distance, a windmill is seen. Don Quixote, believing it is a ferocious four-armed giant, attacks it.Don Quixote first pierces one vane with the lance, then attacks with his sword. He is scooped up by the sails of the windmill, and ""rides"" it until he loses his balance and clatters to the ground.Don Quixote explains that, at the last minute, an evil enchanter who has it in for him has changed the giant into a windmill. As Sancho tends to his bruises, Don Quixote says in all seriousness: ""A knight must not complain of his wounds, though his bowels be dropping out"".Upon higher ground in the distance, a sprawling establishment is seen, and Don Quixote decides to proceed to yonder castle. Sancho tells him it's really an inn, but no matter . . .In the courtyard of the inn, a group of mule team drivers have stopped and want food and drink. The serving wench is curvaceous Aldonza (Sophia Loren), a hard working servant with a habit of selling herself for money during the night. As she serves, she is accosted by many men, and she pushes them off. Pedro (Brian Blessed) is the leader, and feels entitled to have first dibs on Aldonza, but she rejects him.Pedro: My mules are not so stubborn. Aldonza: Fine! Make love to your mules!While this is going on, a horn blast is heard. It is Don Quixote, arriving, asking for the Lord of the Castle, puzzled that dwarfs have not been sent out to meet him, . The innkeeper (Harry Andrews) welcomes him and soon decides to humor him in his delusions. He explains that the dwarfs are busy with other duties.Don Quixote instructs the innkeeper thus: ""See that your grooms care for my fleet-footed Rocinante, a horse of courage, sobriety, and chastity, the flower and glory of horseflesh"".When the innkeeper's wife expresses concern that he might have no money, the innkeeper replies:
""When has a poor man ever found time to run mad? Of course he has money, he's a gentleman,"" and Don Quixote is shown to an upstairs room.As Don Quixote enters the busy main patio, he addresses the muleteers and others present as Lords and Ladies, causing merriment, but he takes no notice. He does notice Aldonza, and his brain is immediately in a new track, addressing her as his lady Dulcinea, and approaches her, explaining to her who she really is in a song, ""Dulcinea"".Aldonza is puzzled, busy and not in humor for such craziness, although she appreciates being treated with respect. She assumes he wants what all the others want from her. The muleteers all keep guffawing and laughing at him.In the meantime, at the home of Alonso Quijana, his niece Antonia (Julie Gregg) and his housekeeper (Rosalie Crutchley) ask advice from the parish priest (Ian Richardson) and physician Sansón Carrasco (John Castle), who is Antonia's suitor. The women voice their worries in song: I'm Only Thinking of Him, quite concerned with the embarrassment triggered by his antics.Carrasco's views dominate: ""A man who chooses to be mad can also choose to be sane."" He concocts a plot to convince Don Quixote to return home, and then they will see what to do next.Back at the inn, Sancho brings a letter from Don Quixote to Aldonza, asking for a token that he can wear in battle, something like a silk scarf. She is intrigued but scoffs, giving Sancho a dirty floor rag. Eventually, Don Quixote gets the rag, kisses it and holds it as if it were a beautiful pristine silken scarf.An itinerant barber (Gino Conforti) shows up at the gate and enters, wearing a bright brass barber's shaving basin as a hat. Don Quixote sees the bright brass and, very agitated, demands it be given to him, claiming it is the fabled Golden Helmet of Mambrino, a magical item that protects the knight who wears it. The barber recognizes the situation.As the basin is worth only half a crown, the terrified barber acquiesces at swordpoint, and all the mule drivers enjoy the joke.As soon as the barber departs, Don Quixote kneels in front of the innkeeper and asks for a boon, that he should the very next morning dub him knight, as he has agreed to fight a real knight, but has no right to do so until he is dubbed. He will stay up all night, as required by the rules, watching over his armor. He must fast, so he declines dinner.Some time after dusk, a group in black mourning costumes, bringing a bier, the principals masked, show up at the gate and ask for Don Quixote de la Mancha. After he identifies himself, a tearful lady veiled in black asks Don Quixote to grant her a boon. He agrees, of course, and she says that their relative on the bier has been turned into stone by the spell of an evil enchanter. The spell can be broken if Don Quixote will agree to meet the enchanter in battle. The enchanter will presumably wait for Don Quixote the next day, on the road, near Don Quixote's village.The stone man on the bier was a man hired to participate in a hoax, the tearful veiled lady was none other than Antonia Quijana, and the other two were Sansón Carrasco and the housekeeper. Also there was the local village priest, who reluctantly joined the group, although he sympathizes more with Quixote.After the night watch starts, Aldonza comes to talk to Don Quixote. Exasperated, she asks him why he does the things he does. He says that all that matters is that he follow the Quest, and sings the musical's signature song ""The Impossible Dream"": ""To dream, the impossible dream / To right, the unrightable wrong / To love, pure and chaste from afar / To try, when your arms are too weary / To reach the unreachable star. / This is my quest, to follow that star.../ To fight for the right / Without question or pause / To be willing to march / Into Hell for a Heavenly cause!"". etc. Aldonza is deeply moved by the song and begins to sympathize with the knight. Pedro the chief muleteer comes to Aldonza, angry that she is late for their lovemaking. He slaps her, and a brawl ensues, Don Quixote and Sancho and Aldonza on one side, Pedro and the muleteers on the other, but only Pedro fights for real, the others are in it for making fun of Don Quixote, so they clown around somewhat and at the end of it, the muleteers are all unconscious on the ground.The innkeeper thinks things are getting out of control, so he insists on knighting Don Quixote right away, and politely orders him to bed and to leave the first thing the next morning.The muleteers decide to take revenge on Aldonza, and when, by the laws of chivalry, she ""ministers to their wounds"", they savagely beat her and carry her off with them in order to rape her.Don Quixote and Sancho leave the inn, hopeful and joyful, renewing their discussions of knight errantry, and Don Quixote corrects Sancho in his speech, saying he uses way too many proverbs.They come upon the furious Aldonza on the roadside. She is bitter, and mocks Don Quixote's attempts to comfort her.Just then, a few paces away, we see a knight in full armor, flanked by a dozen squires bearing shields decorated with mirrors. They approach and surround Don Quixote, taunt him with his failures, dazzle them shining the sun into his eyes, and Don Quixote, still reeling and shocked by Aldonza's rejections, collapses.We next see Don Quixote in bed, surrounded by the Priest, Carrasco, Antonia, and the housekeeper. His experience with the Knight of the Mirrors has sent him into a coma.First Sancho, then Aldonza, come to see him, and push their way in to talk to him, although Carrasco wants to keep them out, but the Priest says there's no point. Upon hearing Sancho's voice, Don Quixote opens his eyes and starts talking very softly. He says he is no longer Don Quixote, but Alonso Quijana: ""Soft and fair, my friends; in last year's nests there are no birds this year."" He tells the priest to write down his last will. He has only a vague memory of being Don Quixote, but Aldonza, who has found she cannot live without being Dulcinea, begs him to remember. He eventually does, and rises from his bed ready to search for adventures once again. However, his strength fails him, and he dies in Sancho and Aldonza's arms. But to Aldonza, Don Quixote can never die, and when Sancho calls her by her real name, she gently asks him to call her Dulcinea.The prisoners have been deeply moved by Cervantes's ""entertainment"" and return his manuscript to him. It is the still-unfinished novel, ""Don Quixote de la Mancha"". As Cervantes and his manservant are escorted by the Inquisition to their trial, the prsoners sing a final reprise of ""The Impossible Dream""."
Across 110th Street,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068168/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two New York City cops go after amateur crooks who are trying to rip off the Mafia and start a gang war. In Harlem, two Italian mobsters meet three black gangsters that work for the kingpin Doc Johnson to collect dirty money from their associates in an apartment building. Out of the blue, the small-time thieves Jim Harris and Joe Logart knock on the door disguised as police officers to steal US$ 300,000.00 from the Mafia. However, they startle when the suitcase with the money falls on the floor and Jim kills the five men with a machine gun. They flee to the runaway car driven by Henry J. Jackson and they kill two policemen. The idealist NYPD Lt. Pope and the violent Capt. Mattelli investigate the case while the Italian Mafia and the black gangsters hunt the killers down. Will Jim Harris and his accomplices be found?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The NYPD investigates the carnage the aftermath of a crime of a yet unknown nature in Harlem. By the body count at one site - three black men, and two white men - plus one black and one white police officer killed in pursuit, the NYPD believes that at the core of the crime is the Italian mafia. Indeed, three black men - Jimmy Harris, Joe Logart and Henry Jackson - the former two masquerading as police officers, the latter the getaway driver, were able to rob the mafia's Harlem operation of $300,000, and although they walked into the operation not intending on any violence, the seven dead bodies was the final outcome. As the NYPD investigates the crime and the mafia embarks on getting their money back while showing the crooks in no uncertain terms that they will never be able to get away with it, the conflicts are not relegated to just between the three groups, but also within the NYPD and the mafia in the racially charged environment that is Harlem. The NYPD decides to appoint Lt. William Pope, a black man, to lead the investigation, which does not sit well with Italian-American Capt. Frank Morelli, a thirty-three year veteran of the force and an anti-black bigot. And Doc Johnson, the black lead of organized crime in the neighborhood, has no respect for who the mafia sends to lead the clean up, Nick D'Salvio, who Johnson taunts as only having gotten to his position by marrying the boss' daughter, while D'Salvio in return goes to extremes to prove Johnson wrong.—Huggo In a daring robbery, some $300,000 is taken from the Italian mob. Several mafiosi are killed, as are two policemen. Lt. Pope and Mattelli are two New York City cops trying to break the case. Three small-time criminals are on the run with the money. Will the mafia catch them first, or will the police?—Ken Miller <wkmiller704@yahoo.com> This is a violent urban thriller about a corrupt old white cop and an honest young black cop chasing three black robbers-cum-murderers who ran away with $300,000 that belonged to the Italian mob. The police must find them before the sadistic Mafia henchman Nick D'Salvio reaches them first.—Ørnås A trade of drug money is occurring between two Italians (from the South of 110th street in New York) and three blacks (from Harlem to the North of 110th Street). Suddenly, two men (Paul Benjamin & Ed Bernard) uniformed as police officers knock on the door. When they enter one of the two men dressed as cops holds the drug dealers hostage with a machine gun. When one of the black hostages reaches for his pistol, the man shoots everyone in the room to death, except his partner. When the two killers rush out with the drug money, they hop in a car with their driver (Antonio Vargas). When the driver nervously hits a few of the cars around them, it attracts the attention of an African-American cop, who is shot to death by the man with the machine gun before he realizes what's going on. Another cop (this one white) comes upon the situation and pulls his gun, but is fatally hit by the getaway car.Seemingly before the cops are aware of the situation, the two crime syndicates are aware that they've been ripped off. Mafioso Nick D'Salvio(Anthony Franciosa) is coached by his Don (who is also his father-in-law) that this is an opportunity to keep the blacks in check and that he must severely punish the men responsible for the robbery and the murder of the two Italians. D'Salvio pays a visit to the black crime boss in Harlem, Doc Johnson (Richard Ward). Johnson promises to put his main henchman, Shevvy (Gilbert Lewis), on the the trail of the thiefs. But D'Salvio threateningly intones that, while Shevvy may find them, the punishment must be left to the Italians. Johnson, unintimidated, taunts D'Salvio as a ""punk errand boy"", causing D'Salvio to try to attack him. However, D'Salvio's henchman hold him back and calm him before they leave.The police have finally arrived and are all over the building where the drug theft and massacre occurred. Aging Cpt. Mattelli (Anthony Quinn) arrives prepared to oversee the investigation. However Mattelli's chief lets him know to his chagrin that the much younger (and African-American) Lt. Pope (Yaphet Kotto) will be leading the investigation. Pope mistrusts Mattelli because he rightly believes Mattelli to be a drunk, a racist, and a crooked cop who doesn't hestitate to beat up suspects or even crime witnesses.The mostly black residents in the surrounding neighborhood of the crime (although we know many of them witnessed the crime) refuse to disclose information to the police. However, they gladly let Doc Johnson know the vehicle that was used in the getaway. Shevvy and D'Salvio use this track down it's new owner, Henry J. Jackson, who we recognize as the getaway driver of earlier. Meanwhile, tipped off to the vehicle's location, Mattelli and Pope have the car pulled out of the Hudson River. However, before they can figure out who was driving, Shevvy and D'Salvio have tracked down Jackson to a whorehouse. D'Salvio smashes Jackson in the face with a glass and then beats him to the floor until Jackson is a bloody pulp. Before they leave, Shevvy is given Jackson's clothes and finds a note from a dry cleaners. The police find Jackson tied up in crucifixion and that he's been castrated. Pope and Mattelli try to get Jackson to tell them the identity of his killer in an ambulance, but Jackson is only able to scream in agony before he dies.Joe Logart (Bernard), who we recognize as one of the thieves dressed as a cop at the beginning, nervously sees the TV report of Jackson's murder. He is an employee at the same dry cleaner that Jackson had a note from. He goes to see the other, more trigger happy thief, Jim Harris (Benjamin), to let him know that he's going to try and leave the area. Logart suggests that Harris should escape as well, but Harris refuses and wishes Logart well. We find that Harris lives with his girlfriend and has told her about the robbery. Harris is a 42-year-old ex-con and tells her that there's no way he could make money other than by crime.Mattelli takes Pope to Doc Johnson's office. Mattelli warns Johnson ""no more crucifixions!"" However, Johnson is again unfazed and denies involvement in Jackson's murder. For Pope's benefit, Johnson announces that Mattelli has long since been paid off by Johnson for looking the other way in numerous crimes. Mattelli nearly attacks Johnson but sadly backs away. Johnson makes it clear that he no longer wants to deal with Mattelli and offers Pope to take his place. However, the honest Pope tells Johnson to take his money and ""stick it up your ass"". When Shevvy tries to manhandle Mattelli out of Johnson's office, Mattelli assaults him and beats him badly. However, Pope manages to pull Mattelli away.Logart, bags all packed, hails a cab. The cab driver acts suspicuously and calls into say that this be his ""last fare of the night"". Suddenly, two cars, containing D'Salvio, Shevvy and their henchmen, pull in front of the taxi. The cab driver runs off, but Logart manages to jump to the driver's seat and drive off. He runs down one of Shevvy's men and shoots another. Logart speeds off, but hits traffic with the two cars coming after him. Logart abandons the taxi and runs into an empty high rise being built. He manages to kill a couple more henchman, but Logart is soon surrounded and overpowered on one of the highest floors. D'Salvio and his men hang Logart by his ankles and swing him off the edge of the building. They threaten to let him fall to his death if he doesn't disclose the identity of his crime partner. He eventually does tell them about Harris, but D'Salvio still lets Logart die.Mattelli and Pope go to visit Jackson's estranged wife. They let her know that Jackson has been killed, but Pope claims it was in a car accident. When they question her about Jackson's associates, she recalls Jim Harris's name. Going through police records, Mattelli and Pope narrow the various suspects down to the most likely ""Jim Harris"". Mattelli soon offers to confess to his various illegal activities so Pope can take his position, but the angry Pope refuses, saying he wants to become Captain on his own terms.Harris leaves his girlfriend's apartment to go to an abandoned hideout nearby. However, he seems to have forgotten his medicine and goes into a seisure. When his girlfriend rushes to his hideout to give him his medicine, she is followed (without her knowledge) by Shevvy, who concludes that she must be going to see Harris. Shevvy and Johnson tip off D'Salvio to Harris's location, after which Johnson claims to know how this situation is going to turn out.The next morning, D'Salvio and a few henchmen go to the building where Harris and his girlfriend are hiding. D'Salvio knocks on his door and claims to be police. Harris immediately opens fire through the door, killing one of D'Salvio's henchmen. D'Salvio returns fire into the apartment, shooting and killing Harris's girlfriend. D'Salvio and Harris shoot it out through the hideout door. Harris eventually shoots D'Salvio and then knocks him over with the door, sending D'Salvio down the stairs to smash his face through a window . D'Salvio dies screaming. Harris goes out the street and mows down all of D'Salvio's henchmen with his machinegun. When a cop car pulls up, Harris also guns down both cops inside.Soon, the building is surrounded by cops, including Mattelli and Pope, and Harris takes refuge inside. The police trade fire with him until he is cornered on the roof. We see an unnoticed Shevvy crouched on the roof a nearby building, armed but seemingly enjoying the violent spectacle. Although Harris kills a few more cops, some snipers shoot him in the side and the arm. Harris throws his bag of hard-fought drug money over the side of the building into a crowd of onlookers, who fight over it. Mattelli climbs up to confront Harris, but lose his footing and is soon at Harris's gun point. However, before Harris can kill Mattelli, Pope arrives, shooting and finally killing Harris. Shevvy sets up his sniper gun on a mount and then shoots Mattelli. Mattelli falls into Pope's hands and dies."

Rebecca washes clothes for a local white woman, Miss Boatwright (Carmen Matthews). David, his brother and sister deliver the laundry to Miss Boatwright. She pays for the laundry and gives David a copy of the Three Musketeers. 'When you're finished reading it, we'll talk about it, y'hear.'
Nathan is pitching at a softball game. All his family is watching. He gets the final out and wins the game for his team. Ecstatic, the family returns home. The local sheriff (James Best) is in their cabin. He emerges with a side of meat.
Nathan is handcuffed in front of his wife and children. He is pushed into the back of a pickup truck with a deputy and the truck drives away.
Growling, Sounder takes off after the truck. The deputy seated next to Nathan raises his rifle. Nathan attempts to kick the rifle out of the deputy's hand. The gun goes off. Sounder is hit and disappears into high grass. David gives chase but can't find him.
Rebecca tries to visit Nathan in jail. The sheriff won't allow it. Visitors only on Sundays and holidays; women, never.
Rebecca is in the grocery store. She barters walnuts for groceries. The store owner is Mr. Perkins (Ted Airhart), who also owns the land the family works on. Perkins lambastes Rebecca for what Nathan did-namely, making him, Perkins, look bad. In addition, who's going to sharecrop for him if Nathan is in jail?It's Nathan's sentencing. Though Nathan's family are the only spectator's in the courtroom, they are seated at the back. Nathan Lee Morgan is found guilty of 'unlawful trespass and robbery' and sentenced to one year of hard labor. The camp where he is to serve his sentence is not mentioned. Flanked by two white deputies, Nathan is whisked out of the courtroom. No goodbye, no contact at all is allowed with his family.
Life goes on. The children are helping Rebecca with the laundry, and David continues to look for Sounder.
Rebecca and the children go to the station to see Nathan. Rebecca sends David in with a chocolate cake and instructs him to find out what camp Nathan will be sent to.David sees Nathan behind bars. They are both happy to see each other. David hands his Daddy the cake through the bars. They eat and talk. Then Nathan says he doesn't want them to come and visit anymore.Rebecca and the children work the fields. David reads The Three Musketeers to his brother and sister.One Sunday two friends are at Rebecca's home after church, for a meal. Ike (Taj Mahal) is playing the resonator guitar and Harriet (Sylvia 'Kuumba' Williams) starts dancing. The pastor arrives. He had been down to the courthouse, but the police didn't tell him 'nothing' about what camp Nathan was taken to. He warns Rebecca not to be bitter, but, like he's said to other women with similar 'misery or trials,' take it to God.
David is working the fields and hears a dog whimpering. Sounder returns.David drops off another load of clean laundry to Miss Boatwright's house. He asks if she can find out what camp his Daddy was sent to. Miss Boatwright: The courthouse has rules about things like that, but I'll ask around town about it. David is unconvinced: I'll see you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright. Miss. Boatwright: I'll find out where your Daddy is for you...
goes through the sheriff's files, but the sheriff returns and catches her.Miss Boatwright asks the sheriff where Nathan is being held. He refuses to tell her. He leaves the room to answer a telephone call. David appears. Miss Boatwright
Miss Boatwright leaves. David suspects that she saw where his father is being held. She denies it.Miss Boatwright turns up at the Morgan's home. 'The camp where Nathan is being held is called Wishbone Labor camp...' She sits with Rebecca and the children and attempts to find the camp on a map.David sets out with Sounder and a map to find his Daddy.After traveling a great distance, through heat and rain, through fields and across creeks, he comes across a group of black prisoners and their guards. He asks a guard if he knows his father, Nathan Lee Morgan. The guard replies 'Never heard of him, boy.'
Through a fence, David asks a group of prisoners if they've heard of his father. A guard overhears David. He raises his billy club and brings it down hard on David's hand. David flees, Sounder in tow.David gets lost and comes across a schoolhouse with black children and a black teacher. The teacher, Camille Johnson (Janet McLaughlin), invites him in. He asks her if he can wash the blood off his hand. Miss Johnson invites him to stay for class, and invites him to her home afterwards for a hot meal, 'then we can talk about how we can get you back home.'At Miss Johnson's home, David notices her many books. She shows him books on Harriet Tubman and Crispus Attucks, and reads from a work by W.E.B. DuBois. David listens attentively. When she's finished, he smiles: You're a nice lady, Miss Johnson.The following day David attends Miss Johnson's class. A student, Clarence, tells a story about saving his sister from drowning. Another student says he doesn't believe the story because Clarence can't swim. David says he believes Clarence's story, because his family, like Clarence, had to do what seemed impossible to survive, simply because they had to do it. They had no choice.That evening Miss Johnson tells David that she believed Clarence's story as well. When he confides in her that he believes he's failed for not finding his Daddy, she encourages him not to think that way. Not many little boys could have done what you've done, she tells him. David asks if he can come back and study with the other children.David returns home with books Miss Johnson gave him. He tells his Mama about Miss Johnson's offer to teach him at her school. Rebecca replies: 'Who's going to help on the farm? Well, maybe by that time your Daddy'll be back -if it's all right with him it's all right with me.'
Rebecca is on the porch, sewing. Sounder is lying under the porch. Suddenly he springs to his feet and slowly walks out to the front yard, barking. In the distance a solitary figure approaches on foot. Sounder scampers towards the figure. Nathan hobbles on one crutch. The family rushes to meet him. He throws down the crutch and embraces them. 'What happened to your leg, Daddy?' David asks. Dynamite blast. 'When I wasn't no more use to them, they took some time off my sentence and let me come home.'Nathan is hit by a piece of machinery while working the field. He collapses and needs time to get back to his feet.Ike shows up with a letter. Mr. Perkins told him to bring it over. It's from Miss Johnson for David. If he's going to come to her school, he should be there in about a week. David tells his Daddy he doesn't want to go, 'Daddy, you just got home. I wanna stay home and be with you.' Nathan replies, 'I wanna be with you too, but school is something you need, something's good for you, like good air to breathe. And I want you to have it. And that's the way it's gonna be.' David defiantly refuses to go and runs away. Rebecca chides Nathan for being rough with David. Nathan goes after David. They meet at a nearby creek.Nathan tells David of the accident at the labor camp, and his determination to survive and return to his family. He says: 'I'm gonna beat this trouble in my leg. That's what I want you to do. I want you to beat the life they got laid out for you in this place. Son, don't get too used to this place, cause wherever you is I'm gon' love you...'"

In return, they allow the settlers to move across Indian territory unhindered and to hunt a few buffalo needed to feed the wagon-train settlers. However, not everyone in the region is friendly toward the westward-traveling Black settlers. Owners of Southern plantations, dismayed by the loss of slave manpower that previously worked the plantations for free, hire band of white rogues and outlaws to prevent former Black slaves from going West. In order to achieve this aim, the hired bands of rogues attack wagon trains and destroy the wagons, the supplies and the food resources of the former slaves. They threaten the Black settlers with harm and they tell them to return to the Southern states where they came from and work the plantations. Wagonmaster Buck encourages the freed slaves to continue their trek westward and to not give up their dream of settling in the West.

Outside town he meets a wagon train formed of freed slaves and led by none other than Buck. After an angry exchange between the preacher and Buck, the preacher joins the wagon train. During the following days of travel, the preacher notices that all the money of the wagon train is kept in a money belt one of the women carries around her waist.

The preacher follows Buck and he witnesses the payment made by Buck to the Indian chief for safe passage of the settlers. When Buck, followed by the preacher, returns to the wagon train, a gruesome scene awaits. DeShay's gang attacked the wagon train, stole the settlers' money, destroyed their food and supplies and even killed a few settlers. Heartbroken, the surviving settlers want to turn back but Buck encourages them to go on. Angry at the devastation, Buck and the preacher decide to ride to the town of Copper Springs and exact revenge on DeShay's gang and also try to retrieve the money DeShay stole from the Black settlers.

But this turns out to be only the first time they have to steal it... Dr. Amusa approaches Dortmunder about a valuable gem in a museum that is of great signifigance to his people in Africa, stolen during colonial times. Dortmunder assembles a crack team of cat burglars and hatches an elaborate plan for stealing the gem. Despite their care and experience, circumstances and plain bad luck keep the gem just out of their reach.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> A band of four thieves - bomb maker Greenberg, driver Murch, locksmith Kelp and the mastermind Dortmunder (who happens to be Kelp's brother-in-law) - are hired by Dr. Amusa, an African ambassador, to steal the museum-housed diamond called the Sahara Stone, a gem of cultural importance to Dr. Amusa's country. This heist is not going to be the only one that Dortmunder has to plan to retrieve the diamond, as, one time after another, the foursome manage to have the gem, but not quite in their own possession. Working with, or perhaps against the foursome in retrieving the gem is Greenberg's father (shyster lawyer). Despite the problems in getting the diamond, Dortmunder is determined to break what he calls the curse of the diamond.—Huggo John Dortmunder (Robert Redford), an inmate, goes through the exit process at a prison, including retrieving his old clothes, verifying his identity with a finger print, and retrieving his belongings. The warden offers him his rehabilitation speech but John says hes been successfully rehabilitated by the warden's program. The warden sarcastically implies, whatever prison he will wind up working for, that he will see John again.As John walks away from the prison, a car follows him, with the driver calling his name. John runs. When the driver finally catches up to him, he identifies himself as his old pal. John punches him.They drive into the city. The driver, Andrew Kelp (George Segal), hands John a beer and it turns out Kelp is married to John's sister. Kelp asks how his time was and John interrupts saying he's not going to work a job with him. Kelp, feigning offense, starts to tell John about a job.They are at a museum, with a crowd, studying a 10 by 5 by 5 display case holding The Sahara Stone. John doesn't think it's do-able. Kelp recommends John meet The Doctor, the money man, before he makes a decision. Kelp tells John not to mention that he has been in prison so as not to undermine The Doctor's confidence.They meet The Doctor (Moses Gunn) at a park. The Doctor explains that he wants the Stone so that he may return it to his native country which has been fighting with a neighboring country over the ownership of the diamond for generations. The United Nations is deciding the Stone's fate, but The Doctor would be more comfortable if his nation was in possession of it should the UN make a bad decision.The Doctor says it's a four-man job and is offering a payment of $25,000 per man. Kelp and John negotiate with The Doctor to cover expenses during their planning process. The Doctor refuses; John leaves. Kelp tells The Doctor that John is just out of prison and has no means of support. The Doctor gives in. John comes back and The Doctor offers him $75 a week. John leaves again. Kelp says he can convince John to do it if he is offered $150. The Doctor agrees.Kelp catches up to John and John lists the arguments against doing the job: that The Doctor is not experienced in a job; that the position of the stone within the museum (30 steps from the nearest exit); that the case is shatter- and bullet-proof, made with glass embedded with metal; and that there is no alarm system meaning the guards will be extra vigilant. However, John thinks the guards can be occupied with a well-planned diversion, and the locks seem easy to pick. He agrees to do the job.They stop by Kelp's locksmith shop and then go to his apartment. John's sister greets him warmly. John says he doesn't want to work with Kelp because if they get caught, no one will be around to look after her.A woman pulls up to a garage where her son, Stan Murch (Ron Leibman), proudly announces he's purchased a soundtrack album of the Daytona 500. He plays it for her to cheer her. They listen happily. The garage phone rings. It's Kelp.John goes to a bar and the bartender directs him to the back room. Stan is there and immediately goes into a description of the route he took to get to the bar, which explains why he got there early. Alan Greenberg (Paul Sand) arrives. Kelp arrives.Stan asks why they don't just keep collecting the $150 per week. John says there is a time limit on The Doctor's patience. Greenberg wonders why they just don't keep the Stone for themselves and negotiate with the insurance company. Kelp says The Doctor knows who he and John are, and he would rather not have the wrath of an entire African nation upon them. John notes that their prep work will involve a lot of pre-surveillance at night, and the neighborhood around the museum has been hit by muggings.At night, John cases the museum. There are a handful of guards milling around. Kelp works on some locksets at home.Kelp visits The Doctor at his office and presents him with a shopping list of the team's suit sizes for uniforms. The Doctor realizes that they are making progress and proudly identifies himself as a criminal.John and Greenberg are fishing by a quiet lake when John gives him a signal and Greenberg gets up and tosses a handmade grenade into the bushes. It explodes with a fireball. Greenberg tosses another that he learned how to make while studying at the Sorbonne and John says it has to be bigger. Greenberg reaches into his sack for another that he learned how to make while studying at Berkeley and John wants it bigger still, and noisier.At night, after closing, Kelp is casing the museum when a hippie hits him with a baton. Kelp yells for help and a museum guard comes out. As the guard holds a gun on the hippie, Kelp points a gun at the guard. With the guard blindfolded, they go inside. The hippie is John in disguise.Stan, down the block in a beater, checks his watch and then drives erratically toward the museum. He flips the car right at the main entrance and stumbles out as the car explodes. The guards come running out. Stan, lying on the ground with blood all over, repeats that he lost control of the steering.Kelp and John, dressed in guard uniforms, enter the display room. Kelp lies down next to the case and takes out a pick set. John is the look-out. Kelp takes a long time using various picks and John asks how it's going. Kelp almost falls apart, saying that John is only asking him because he has no confidence in Kelp. John reminds Kelp that if he is caught tonight, that he will go to prison for life; and that the reason he chose to do the job with Kelp is that Kelp has golden hands. Kelp gets back to work more confidently.It does not look good for Stan as the guards gather around. Greenberg pushes through saying he is a doctor. He enlists the guards to help him put Stan in traction because his ribs are scratching against his heart.Kelp is as surprised as John when the lock pops. He goes to work on the other lock. The guards all have their hands on Stan, holding him in position, and he cries out if they move the slightest. Greenberg runs off into the museum and changes into a guard uniform. Kelp has popped the remaining lock and the three of them try to lift the display case. They struggle but get it high enough for Kelp to sneak under and in to get the Stone. Greenberg loses his grip and they drop the case, trapping Kelp inside.The ambulance has arrived and takes Stan away. The guards head back inside. Kelp crawls out just as the guards enter. A chase ensues. Kelp and John escape. Greenberg is trapped and swallows the Stone.The next day, at Kelp's apartment, Kelp runs in proudly pointing at the front page of the newspaper. Stan is there, having escaped by assaulting a doctor in the ambulance. John asks Kelp if the article mentions the status of the Stone. Kelp assumes that Greenberg dropped it somewhere in the museum. Kelp asks what he should tell The Doctor. John says he doesn't care and leaves.John is at the doctor worried about ulcers, but the doctor tells him it is gastritis. He recommends John stay away from tense or argumentative situations. He thinks John internalizes his stress.Kelp has found John, with another job in mind, this time to break Greenberg out of state prison because Greenberg has the Stone. Kelp and John go to a quiet park and meet with The Doctor and Greenberg's lawyer (Zero Mostel). The lawyer tells them Greenberg will be happy to give them the Stone if they get him out of prison. Otherwise, Greenberg will exchange the Stone for a lighter sentence. It turns out the lawyer is Greenberg's father and he is not happy the others have corrupted his son. The lawyer gives John some notes and the layout of the prison.The lawyer visits Greenberg in prison and their conversation is a thinly veiled discussion about the plans for his escape.Kelp meets with The Doctor outside the UN and asks for a huge truck. Later, at night, a big rig pulls up outside the prison and Stan lets off Kelp and John. Kelp snips at a cyclone fence with bolt cutters and they enter the grounds, avoiding the searchlights. They cut through another fence and make it to the wall where they throw up a grappling hook and climb over. John pops an antacid and Kelp asks for one, thinking its hard candy. When Kelp realizes what it is, he's disappointed that for all these years he has envied Johns nerves of steel.Kelp picks a door lock to get them into the cell block. Greenberg gets out of bed and picks a fight with his cellmate; they fight. Kelp and John sneak through the kitchen. Stan opens the back door/ramp of the big rig. Two guards walk Greenberg into the prison hospital and Kelp and John sneak up behind them and drag off the guards. They run out of the building and back to the wall. Greenberg says he cannot climb the rope. Stan drives a convertible Mercedes out of the big rig. Greenberg struggles but makes it over. The spotlight catches John just as he is going over. The klaxon sounds and the guards start shooting, but the trio makes it through both cyclone fences and into Stan's car. He speeds off, erratically, and guns it full speed onto the ramp and into the back of the big rig. The door closes behind them. Greenberg urges them to drive off but Kelp says the plan is to wait until 6 AM and drive off with the other trucks, then they will exchange the Stone in the city. Greenberg confesses that he passed the Stone while he was in detention and hid it in the police station. The Doctor wonders why Greenberg didn't just keep swallowing it.John is outside the police station, casing the building. Kelp gives The Doctor another shopping order. Later, the team goes to a riverside location and get into a helicopter. Stan assures them he knows how to fly one. He flies them to the police station and they jump out - it's the wrong building. They make it to the correct building, set up equipment to jam the radio, and cut the phone lines. They throw smoke and tear gas bombs onto the street and the policemen rush out of the building. The Stone is not where Greenberg left it.Back in the helicopter, Stan declares he's had it with the Stone. John thinks he's been personally jinxed by the Stone and swears to get it at all costs. He asks Greenberg if he told anyone about the Stone and Greenberg admits to telling his lawyer dad.John drags the lawyer through a warehouse and ride up a fright elevator to a floor where Greenberg is lying on the ground at Kelp's feet beaten and bloodied. They press him and Greenberg recalls that his father told him he could sell the Stone and use the money to free Greenberg. The lawyer denies this and Kelp drags Greenberg to the elevator shaft. The lawyer glares at John, saying he doesn't have it in him, so John drags the lawyer to the shaft as well. John backs off. The lawyer gloats that he was right about John. John says that some people aren't willing to do such things, but some people are, and calls over a thug wearing a stocking over his head. Chicken grabs Greenberg and holds him over his head by the shaft. The lawyer swears he does not have the Stone and asks John to stop this. Finally, John tells the thug to put Greenberg down, but the thug drops him too close to the edge and Greenberg falls into the shaft. Kelp faints. John, stunned, gets punched by the thug who then heads for the lawyer. As the thug drags the lawyer toward the shaft, the lawyer tells them the Stone is in his safe deposit box and tosses them the keys. John picks up the keys. Kelp stands up. The thug turns out to be Stan. Greenberg, unhurt and hanging from a rope, threatens to tell on the lawyer to his mother.Kelp and John go to the bank. They see another customer sign a card and then the teller comparing the signature to what they have on file. Now at The Doctor's office, the lawyer giddily tells them that even if they use his key and forge his signature, they still wont get away with it because hes been tipping the bank staff very well over the years and everyone knows him by sight. The Doctor is not pleased. Kelp promises it will only take a few more days.At the back room of the bar, John presents a few plans - none will end successfully. Stan is late; there are too many construction projects in the area for a smooth getaway. Suddenly, John says, ""Miasmo.""A woman follows a well-dressed man, a banker, into an elevator and he presses a floor for her. She points out the regular pattern of lights that the floor indicator is showing, and how relaxing it is. This puts the man in a hypnotic trance. Meanwhile, John is at the bank to sign up for a safe deposit box. The woman tells the banker that when a man goes to his bank and says, ""Afghanistan, banana stand,"" that the banker must do everything the man says. The banker, in a trance, agrees. Kelp gets a call that the banker has been successfully entranced and John says he has to go to the bank first thing in the morning before the trance wears off.John waits anxiously outside the bank, popping an antacid.Kelp, Stan and Greenberg meet The Doctor at a park bench. The Doctor tells them he has been convinced to fire them by the lawyer, who is sitting at the other end of the bench. The Doctor tells them he has already incurred a lot of expenses despite their failure and they will have to be satisfied with what he's already paid them. The Doctor and the lawyer get in their town car and head for the bank.John goes to the bank. The valet in the safe deposit vault is the hypnotized man. John checks his own box and then says, ""Afghanistan, banana stand."" John gives the man the lawyer's safe deposit key, the man retrieves the box for him, and John gets the Stone. John makes it out of the bank but hears sirens - it's a fire truck. As he walks away, the town car with The Doctor and lawyer, pulls up but they don't see each other. John walks a few blocks and sees the team in Kelp's locksmith car. They drive away cheering."

Non-confident with himself as a man because of Nancy's action, Allan turns to the spirit of one of his movie idols for advice on how to proceed on his dates:Humphrey Bogart, most specifically his portrayal of Rick Blaine inCasablanca (1942). In wanting those dates to work, Allan tries to be like his version of Bogey, which is no where close to who he really is as a person.

His fascination with Bogart sees him constantly trying to be just like him with the women, giving rise to some hilarious, and totally unnatural, moments.—Kyle Perez Allan Felix (Woody Allen), a San Francisco film critic, watches the final scenes of the 1942 film 'Casablanca' and finds himself inspired by the manliness and selflessness of the character of Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart. Soon, however, he reverts to his typical neuroses and insecurity, and recalls the recent departure of his wife Nancy (Susan Anspach), who left him to experience a more exciting life. Wondering how to be more self-confident, Allan imagines Bogart (Jerry Lacy) sitting in his room, advising him to treat women like dames.Later, Allan is visited by his best friends, overworked businessman Dick Christie (Tony Roberts) and his wife Linda (Diane Keaton), a model. Although Dick tries to convince Allan that Nancy's exodus means Allan is free to play around, Allan complains that he has no luck with women. As Linda, another neurotic, and Allan commiserate and compare medications, Dick obsessively calls his office to report on his exact whereabouts. Although Dick and Linda love each other, she feels abandoned by his constant work schedule.The next day, Dick suggests a double date, and when Allan insists on a blonde with large breasts, Linda points out that girls who look that way often do not have great minds. As Allan imagines Nancy on the back of motorcycle complaining about him to her new boyfriend, Linda decides to invite her photographer's assistant, Sharon Lake (Jennifer Salt), to dinner. Allan is immediately overwrought with excitement.At home, as Allan worries about the possible outcomes of the evening, Bogart materializes and recommends that he remain cool and calm. Allan imagines himself winning over Sharon with his manliness, but by the time of the date, he is verging on hysteria.

That date is even worse, however, as she calls herself a nymphomaniac but then refuses to allow him to kiss her.Allan and Linda go to the museum, where Linda admires his intensity, which is so unlike Dick.

Dick later reveals to Allan that Linda feels neglected, but that he is too busy to dote on her.Dick sets up Allan with a woman from his office, Julie, and on their date Julie insists on entering a biker bar. There, two rough men harass them and Allan ineffectually attempts to protect his date. Meanwhile, Linda learns that he is on a date, and is surprised to find that she is jealous. When Allan returns, bedraggled and bruised, his comments about the date reduce her to tears of laughter. Back in the city, both Allan and Linda wander their respective homes feeling lonely.One night, Linda comes over, suffering an anxiety attack because Dick is away on a business trip.

When Linda arrives she has taken Librium and is light-headed. Nervous, Allan tries to talk her in to leaving the apartment, but when she asks if he believes it is possible to love two people at once, he hears Bogart urging him to kiss her.

Allan brings Linda home then walks back to his apartment, feeling uncharacteristically cocky and gregarious.Buying Linda a music box, Allan runs into Nancy in a store and handles the meeting with aplomb. Later, he frets about how Dick will take the news, imagining him having three different responses: first understanding, then killing himself, then killing Allan. Dick is waiting outside Allan's apartment, and there confides that he is afraid Linda is having an affair. Seeing his friend's distress and repentance, Allan calls Linda to instruct her not to leave him, but she is already telling Dick that their marriage is over.When Dick leaves for the airport in response, Linda follows in a cab and Allan rushes after them. In his mind, his cab driver is Bogart, who demonstrates how to let a ""dame"" down easily, then declares he is proud of Allan for his selflessness. At the airport, the three get to the gate at the same time. Allan tells Linda they must call it off, but she has already reached the same conclusion, and thanks him for helping her realize she still loves Dick. Thrilled finally to have a chance to say the words, he recites the lines from the parting scene of Casablanca , in which Rick tells Ilsa that she will regret not following Victor onto his plane, ending with ""Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."" Allan then reassures Dick that although he tried to seduce Linda, she rebuffed him.As Dick and Linda walk off into the fog, Allan is joined by Bogart.

Cries & Whispers,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069467/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a woman dying of cancer in early twentieth-century Sweden is visited by her two sisters, long-repressed feelings between the siblings rise to the surface. In turn-of-the-century Sweden, cancer-stricken, dying Agnes is visited in her isolated rural mansion by her sisters Karin and Maria. As Agnes' condition deteriorates and pain management becomes increasingly more difficult, fear and revulsion grip the sisters, who seem incapable of empathy, and Agnes' only comfort and solace comes from her maid Anna. As the end draws closer, long repressed feelings of grudging resentment and mistrust cause jealousy, selfishness, and bitterness between the siblings to surface.—duke1029 It's the turn of the nineteenth into twentieth centuries in Sweden. The interrelationships between four adult women - sisters Agnes, Karin and Maria, and Agnes' longtime housemaid Anna - are presented. Karin and Maria, both married, have returned to the family country manor estate, where they stay on occasion as they lead their lives, to watch over Agnes, who is on her deathbed, suffering in pain from the final throes of her illness. Karin and Maria's return is despite the three sisters having an unspoken strained and standoffish relationship with each other. Cold and stern Karin is all repressed emotions as she hides behind a proper decorum, those repressed emotions including a hatred for her diplomat husband, Fredrik. Self-absorbed Maria is the quietly but calculatingly sexual one, her slight smiles and furtive glances only noticed by her lovers, who include David, Agnes' doctor. In her spontaneous cries of pain for assistance, Agnes calls out for Anna instead of her sisters. Agnes does call out for her sisters when she has the forethought to think about what is happening. Devout Anna, who has experienced pain herself in that her daughter died years earlier in infancy, is the only one who provides unconditional love and support to Agnes, both in comforting her in life and also in death. The focus on Agnes provides the opportunity most specifically for the three sisters to confront their relationship demons with each other.—Huggo A powerful existential drama that won the Oscar for Best Photography at the hands of the Cinematographer Sven Nykvist. Agnes, a lonely 37-year-old woman, has cancer of the uterus and slowly waits for her death. Karin, her older sister, is trapped in an unhappy marriage to an older man whom she finds repulsive; she appears to be well and hides hatred for her husband and a constant anger against life. Maria, the youngest sister, has a stable marriage surrounded by wealth. It is like a spoiled child: gentle, playful and smiling; she is fascinated by her own beauty, never tormented by the limits of morality. Anna is the servant of the house, the only one who can comfort Agnes. When the illness of the latter worsens, the women of his life gather on his deathbed. An intense film, from the most impressive experimental works by Bergman. A family drama takes place in a mansion in the late 1800's. Karin and Maria watch over their sister Agnes' sickbed together with the servant Anna. Through flashbacks the lives of both sisters are described, which are full of lies, deceit, callousness, self despise, guilt and forbidden love. Agnes' dramatic death cramp arouses only aversion in them. They both retreat in their own way from her when she grasps for their hands.—Fredrik Klasson <fredrik.klasson@boras.mail.telia.com>"

They place the Major in the maze's center, release the dog and turn off the basement lights....After completing the final tale, the Crypt Keeper reveals that he was not warning them of what would happen, but telling them what had happened; they have all died, and it is too late for repentance. Clues to this twist can be spotted throughout the film, including Joan Collins' character wearing the brooch her husband had given her for Christmas just before she killed him.

Zee (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) and Robert Blakeley (Sir Michael Caine) are members of swinging London's upper crust whose unique love-hate marriage heads towards destruction when Robert falls in love with a beautiful young widow named Stella (Susannah York), and Zee goes through a series of scheming adventures to break Robert and Stella up. Approaching middle age, the Blakeleys, architect Robert (Sir Michael Caine) and his brash, overbearing wife Zee (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), are Londoners who are able to indulge in their collective and individual narcissistic wants because of their financial standing and the fact that they have no children. They have a passionate love and hate relationship based largely on those individual wants. At a party, they meet widowed Stella (Susannah York), a couturier. Robert is immediately attracted to her. Robert and Stella openly embark on an affair, which for Robert is merely the latest dalliance in his life. However, the two fall in love, as, for Robert, Stella fulfills those parts of his life that Zee can't or won't since Stella is the antithesis of Zee: understanding with an air of serenity.

When Zee reminds Robert that she is fully aware of his numerous affairs with secretaries in his office and that Stella is no different, Robert tells her to find a lover of her own and leave him in peace. Undaunted, Zee points out that Robert has long been attracted to her impulsive, reckless nature, something which the sedate Stella lacks.

Hoping to dull Zee's barbed attacks, Robert finally suggests they dine out, but when Zee continues her derision of Stella at the restaurant, an exasperated Robert leaves. Although Stella is amused by Robert's departure, Zee is surprised and for a few moments the women speak candidly. Zee observes they might have been friends in another situation, but Stella states she is not who she appears and admits she was expelled from school when younger.A few nights later, Robert goes over the household bills in rising frustration while Zee casually dresses for a party. Angered, Robert binds Zee's hands behind her and forces her to sit with him in the office to discuss their finances. When Zee maintains her usual taunting response, he grows livid, but cannot resist Zee's manipulations and eventually the couple makes love. Soon after, Zee meets with her homosexual friend Gordon to express concern that Robert may truly be in love with Stella. Scorning Stella's sensitivity and guilelessness, Zee asks Gordon to help her dig up information to use against Stella. When Gordon notes her callousness, Zee claims she can do whatever necessary to protect her relationship with Robert.Disgruntled by Gordon's hesitation, Zee drives to Stella's flat and throws garbage cans against the wall and is satisfied when Robert peers down at her angrily. Distressed, Stella admits to Robert that she is afraid of Zee's obsessive nature and wonders if the couple will ever find peace. To soothe her, Robert offers to take her to Scotland and the couple depart the next day.The night after a wonderful day alone together, however, the couple receives a phone call from Gordon reporting that Zee has been in a car accident. Dismayed and wondering how Zee knew where he and Stella were, Robert promises Stella they will look for a flat together, then reluctantly returns to London. Upon finding an apparently healthy Zee, Robert quarrels with her and Zee fears she may have gone too far. The next day, Stella and Robert find a flat, but when she wonders aloud what it will be like living with Robert daily, he grows distant.That evening at home, Robert finds Zee at home uncharacteristically quiet and withdrawn. The couple talks about never having had children and their inability even to keep pets. Zee ruefully reflects they should never have gone to the party where Robert met Stella and retires. Later that night, Robert is awakened by the sound of running water and must break down the bathroom door to reach Zee, who has slashed her wrists and is unconscious in the running bath. After taking Zee to the hospital, Robert visits Stella at the new flat and observes that Zee must love him a great deal, then confides that it crossed his mind to allow Zee to die. Robert then tells Stella that Zee asked her to visit at the hospital. When Stella expresses surprise, Robert points out that Zee genuinely likes Stella and admires her serenity. Although Stella declares she has grown to hate what others expect her to be, she nevertheless visits Zee, whom she finds unusually composed. Zee matter-of-factly describes how difficult it has been for her while Robert has been seeing Stella and observes that people always find their happiness at the expense of others. Moved to offer a similar confidence, Stella reveals that she was expelled from school for falling in love with a nun, then asks if Zee had planned the suicide long before. Zee admits it was an impulsive act, prompted by learning from a friend that Stella and Robert had rented the flat together. The women continue their candid exchange of confidences and end the visit with an embrace.Some days later, while unpacking at the new flat, Robert tells Stella that Zee is throwing him a small farewell party that night. Instead of the intimate gathering Zee had implied, however, the party is a lively, crowded affair and Robert quickly becomes drunk. Zee hastily takes him to her bedroom and the next morning Robert refuses to acknowledge having had sex with her. When Zee protests, Robert demands that she stop playing games with people and calls her a phony. Zee replies by pointing out that Stella is the biggest phony of them all, but Robert storms out, refusing to hear anything further.At the new flat, Stella is distressed that Robert has stayed out all night and laments that Zee will always be a presence in their lives. In frustration, Robert goes to a nearby bar and after getting drunk telephones Rita, who eagerly agrees to meet him. Meanwhile, Zee goes to the new flat to visit Stella, who grows uncomfortable when Zee suggests that she knows Stella's secret and what she wants.That evening, Robert returns to the flat from Rita's and is surprised to find Zee answering the door. Discovering Stella in bed naked and crying, Robert asks what happened, but Stella claims she does not know. Zee assures Robert that she had in fact seduced Stella after learning about her secret past. Zee claims that Stella will be confused for a brief period, but will be fine in a few days and demands he take her to dinner. Before Robert can answer, the film suddenly ends with a freeze frame... leaving it uncertain to what Robert will say and do now over this turn of events of his wife sleeping with his mistress."

State of Siege,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070959/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Using the interrogation of a US counterinsurgency agent as a backdrop, the film explores the consequences of the struggle between Uruguay's government and the leftist Tupamaro guerrillas. In Uruguay in the early 1970s, an official of the US Agency for International Development (a group used as a front for training foreign police in counterinsurgency methods) is kidnapped by a group of urban guerillas. Using his interrogation as a backdrop, the film explores the often brutal consequences of the struggle between Uruguay's government and the leftist Tupamaro guerillas.—Erich Schneider <erich@alumni.caltech.edu> This closely follows a true account of Cold War US black-ops in South America preceding Operation Condor launched by Augusto Pinochet in Chile following the 1973 CIA-orchestrated coup against President Allende and his death by probable assassination. Costa-Gavros also directed Missing, a film about this event starring Jack Lemmon and Sissie Spacek.The historical figure played by Yves Montand in State of Siege was Dan Mitrioni, a former Indiana police chief working in Montevideo within USAID's Office of Public Safety, which in fact was training civilian police in kidnapping, torture and assassinations of suspected Communists parallel to School of the Americas training of South American military personnel. The film opens with the American found dead in the back of a car. We subsequently learn how and why this came about. The Tupamoros, a popular Uruguay insurgency that robbed the rich and gave to the poor, had captured and interrogated the American ""trainer"" at length about his actions and motivations. The captive-captors interactions that take the form of a trial are the heart of the film, revealing the motives and objectives of the insurgents and the defensive rationalizations underlying violent American interference in Latin American governments. The American never breaks and confesses, so they are left with no alternative but to execute him for his many capital crimes.Both Contra-Gavras films provide important history lessons that Americans receive from neither their schools nor their media. Missing was a major box office success, but State of Siege provides the clearest understanding of US Cold War operations and their impacts on targeted societies."

Roma,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069191/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A fluid, unconnected and sometimes chaotic procession of scenes detailing the various people and events of life in Italy's capital, most of it based on director Federico Fellini's life. A virtually plotless, gaudy, impressionistic portrait of Rome through the eyes of one of its most famous citizens, blending autobiography (a reconstruction of Fellini's own arrival in Rome during the Mussolini years; a trip to a brothel and a music-hall) with scenes from present-day Roman life (a massive traffic jam on the autostrada; a raucous journey through Rome after dark; following an archaeological team through the site of the Rome subways; an unforgettable ecclesiastical fashion show).—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> Federico Fellinipays homage to his adopted hometown of Rome through the presentation of a series of vignettes. Many of those vignettes are autobiographical, relating to his own early memories of Rome, from incidents at school, watching a movie at the cinema, a visit to the city when he was 18 and stayed with the Palletta family, attending a provincial theater performance, and visits to different types of brothels. He provides a view of the experience of people just arriving to the city for the first time via the highways into the city. During present day, he shows the dichotomy between Rome's rich artistic and religious history against the modernism occurring in different facets. And he celebrates the people, whether they be longtime residents, people who came never to leave, or those just passing through.—Huggo"

Accompanied only by three robots, he ponders the fate of his last pocket of nature and the murders of his fellow crew members in this far-looking speculative film.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> Freeman Lowell looks after plants in giant space greenhouses. Back on Earth, all the trees have long vanished, so Lowell puts a lot of heart into his work. When orders from Earth are received to destroy the greenhouses, Lowell can't go through with it, and cannot persuade his three colleagues to help him save the plants, so he makes other ""arrangements"".—Rob Hartill Silent Running takes place in the not-so-distant future, at a time in which Earth's plant life has been decimated. Only a few specimens of flora have been preserved, and are currently in space in a fleet of orbiting greenhouses.Freeman Lowell (played by Bruce Dern) is the main character, one of four extraterrestrial forest rangers aboard the Valley Forge, one of the 2,000 metre-long green house freighters. He is passionately dedicated to preserving the orbiting forests and their natural inhabitants, and eventual returning them to Earth for reforestation of his now-barren planet more so than his crewmates, whose main priority seems to be returning to Earth after their one-year deployment to space.The main conflict comes when Lowell and his crew are ordered to destroy the orbiting greenhouses and redeploy the freighters to commercial service. Lowell decides to disobey orders and save the forests he has worked so hard to preserve.Lowell's crewmates manage to jettison and detonate four of the six greenhouse domes on the Valley Forge. Lowell kills one of his crewmates in a struggle to save the two remaining domes, during which he seriously injures his leg. He then manages to trap the other two crewmen in the other remaining dome, which he then jettisons and destroys.With help from the ship's three robots, Lowell feigns a premature dome detonation to fool his superiors, then alters the orbit of the Valley Forge , redirecting it towards Saturn in an attempt to preserve the last forest dome. Injured and alone with three robots, Lowell programs them to perform surgery on his leg.Still in communication with the rest of the fleet, Lowell is informed that the Valley Forge is on a collision course with Saturn's rings, and there is nothing he can do to stop the catastrophic event. The ship will likely be destroyed. With communications failing due to the distance now between the Valley Forge and the rest of the fleet, the ship passes through the rings of Saturn. While the three robots are outside the ship on maintenance duty, one is blown away from the ship, leaving two remaining robots. The ship, and its single greenhouse dome, emerge undamaged on the other side of the rings.Lowell and the two remaining robots chart a course into deep space, far away from the fleet. Alone except for his accompanying drones, Lowell befriends them and renames them Huey, Dewey and (posthumously) Louie. He teaches them to play poker, plant trees, and bury the killed crewmember.Lowell soon realizes that despite all his efforts, his forest is dying from unknown causes. In a desperate and rushed attempt to save the dome he badly damages Huey in an accident with one of the ship's buggies. Repairs are unsuccessful, the forest continues dying, and Lowell begins to come to realize that his mission to save the forest is bound to fail.After weeks alone in space, faint radio chatter is heard from a rescue party mounted from the Valley Forge's sister ship, the Berkshire, which has located the freighter after a long search. Finally able to communicate with Lowell, they inform him that they will be able to reach him within six hours he must jettison the dome but not detonate the nuclear charge, as it is too dark to do so safely.At this point it dawns upon Lowell that what was killing the forest was lack of sunlight. With little time to work, he activates a series of lights to simulate the sun and instructs his last active robot, Dewey, to ""just maintain the forest.""Realizing that his crime will be uncovered when the Berkshire finds him, Lowell jettisons the last dome to safety with the words ""take good care of the forest, Dewey.""With the Berkshire only two hours away from docking, Lowell and the damaged Huey sit facing each other while he arms the last of the six nuclear charges. As he prepares to destroy himself and preserve the last dome, Lowell says to Huey: ""When I was a kid, I put a note into a bottle, and it had my name and address on it. And then I threw the bottle into the ocean. And I never knew if anyone ever found it.""With that, Lowell destroys the Valley Forge with the last of the onboard nuclear charges.The final scene is of a well-lit forest greenhouse drifting into space, tended by the sole remaining robot with a battered watering can. The scene is accompanied by Joan Baez's rendition of the film's theme song."

A mid-level bureaucrat in the New York City mayor's office, thirty-something Alexander Portnoy (Richard Benjamin) would probably admit that his life since puberty has focused on sex, thoughts of which and of everything in life shaped by his Jewish upbringing and the guilt associated with it leading to he being a bundle of neuroses. He blames the way he turned out largely on his overbearing parents, especially his mother, Sophie Portnoy (Lee Grant). He has been able to turn almost every situation into one centered on thoughts of sex, which has required a sexual release in some form or another, often through masturbation. Because of those neuroses, he regularly attends private therapy sessions, his story which is told in one of those sessions. While he touches on all these issues during this session, he focuses on his sexual relationships and/or encounters with women, three in particular. The first is Italian-American Bubbles Girardi (Genie Berlin) when he was a late teen, his want to do it with her tempered by his fear of catching a sexually transmitted disease. The second is Mary Jane Reid (Karen Black), who, long before she met Alex, given the nickname of The Monkey, it with a sexual connotation. The Monkey is the manifestation of all of Alex's sexual fantasies, and while she being a ""shiksa"" i.e. gentile may outwardly be the issue in he introducing her especially to his family, it is another aspect of her being which may be the hindrance in being able to form a long term relationship with her. The third is Jewish Naomi (Jill Clayburgh), who he may consider his intellectual equal which in and of itself is not enough to sustain what he wants with her. His neuroses at this point in his life are manifested in his constant visions of The Monkey falling out of the sky to the ground in front of him.—Huggo"

Slaughterhouse-Five,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069280/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Billy Pilgrim has mysteriously become unstuck in time. He goes on an uncontrollable trip back and forth from his birth in New York to life on a distant planet and back again to the horrors of the 1945 fire-bombing of Dresden. Using his own terminology, Billy Pilgrim is ""unstuck in time"", which means he is moving between different points in his life uncontrollably, although he is aware of it at certain of those points as witnessed by the letter to the editor he writes to the Ilium Daily News about his situation. Primarily, he is moving between three general time periods and locations. The first is his stint as a GI during WWII, when, as a pacifist, he was acting as a Chaplain's assistant for his unit. This time is largely as a POW, where he was in Dresden the day of the bombing, spending it with among others an older compassionate GI named Edgar Derby, and a brash loudmouth GI named Paul Lazzaro. The second is his life as an optometrist in Ilium in upstate New York, eventually married to the wealthy and overbearing Valencia Merble, and having two offspring, Robert, who would spend his teen-aged years as a semi-delinquent, and Barbara, who would end up much like her mother. And the third is as an abductee on the planet Tralfamadore, along with his devoted dog Spot, and Hollywood starlet Montana Wildhack - who was not averse to taking off her clothes to further her career - the Tralfamadorians who have put them on display. The more time he spends on Tralfamadore, the more he understands the meaning of what is happening to him.—Huggo Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s classic novel comes to life in this haunting and darkly humorous film from acclaimed directorGeorge Roy Hill.

The opening words of the famous novel are the quickest summary of this haunting, funny film. Director Hill faithfully renders for the screen Vonnegut's obsessive story of Pilgrim, who survives the 1945 firebombing of Dresden, then lives simultaneously in his past as a young American POW, in the future as a well-cared-for resident of a zoo on the planet Tralfamadore, and in the present as a middle-aged optometrist in Ilium, N.Y.—Anonymous It is about March of 1968. A young lady in her early twenties and her husband pull up in their 1969 Ford Country Squire Station wagon to a lavish upstate New York home on a lake, near the town of Ilium, believed to be the fictional title for the actual city of Schenectady. She frantically knocks on the front door calling for her father and no response. She peers through all the windows of the lavish home and sees nothing. Then she lets herself in the back of the home in the utility room desperately searching for her father.In the basement of his home, Billy Pilgrim, a balding, bespectacled, mild-mannered, and passive man of 45 years of age is typing a letter to his local daily newspaper of his time travels and how he is uncontrollably traveling from one point of his life to the other, being ""unstuck in time"". While he is typing his letter, he finds himself at the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium in January 1945, at the age of 22 alone and running through the snow. He is not dressed as a soldier at all, no weapon, and wearing a stocking cap, overcoat, sweater, and pants that are nothing suggesting Army attire. He is kidnapped by two brash, uncouth, mean, and very stupid men of his age, fellow soldiers named Paul Lazzaro and Roland Weary. They immediately think he's a German, but he denies it and they soon forget about it, since there's an attack going on. The men's Corporal abandons them and Lazzaro swears revenge.Briefly, Billy finds himself back on planet Tralfamadore in the geodesic dome with beautiful, 20-something porn star queen, Montana Wildhack and she suspects he's time traveling again and wants to give him a kiss to help forget about it. Simultaneously, Billy is back at the Battle of the Bulge and Paul Lazzaro hears him say ""a little kiss"" and Lazzaro is outraged beyond rationalization and accuses Billy of being homosexual, violently attacking him. Shortly after, two German guards take them at gunpoint tell them to get up and for Weary to give up his bootsIt is the summer of 1946, at Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Billy and his annoying and overweight new bride, Valencia Merble Pilgrim, are on their honeymoon. She thinks he had girlfriends during the war, but was glad they waited to have sex and that he married her. Billy seems bored by her doting and chit-chatting .Back to January 1945, Billy, Weary, and Lazzaro are marching with many other soldiers throughout war-torn remains of an unidentified town in Belgium, France, or Germany. Billy is flirted with by two young prostitutes while marching and bumps into Weary, stepping on his gangrene-riddled feet from wearing no combat boots. Lazzaro is furious and beats up Billy for it. Two German officers spot Billy for his clumsiness and bring him over to pose for a photo. Simultaneously, the portrait flashes forward to 1955-1958 with Billy and his family dedicating a new Ilium Optometry Center. Afterwards, an ill, senile, and shell-shocked Colonel named Wild Bob is escorting the men onto the train bound for a POW camp and fails to realize his men are not there. Billy enters the boxcar and goes to sleep. After pulling the covers on his head, it is the Spring of 1946 and he is in a veterans hospital being treated, allegedly for shell-shock or a nervous breakdown. His southern-accented and sweet-natured mother is talking to fellow patient, Elliot Rosewater of Billy's experiences. Soon afterwards, Billy is back in the boxcar with fellow soldier Weary blaming him for his death from gangrene. Paul Lazzaro cradles him in his arms and he dies. Billy finds himself back in the veterans hospital being given shock treatment.The steam locomotive train pulls up to a POW camp somewhere in Germany. Billy is given a blue, fur-collared overcoat way too small for him by German soldiers as a joke. The men are processed by a German officer and led into a shower room to be deloused. Afterwards, Billy finds himself as a little boy of about 6 or 7 in the shower at the YMCA and his father takes him out of the shower and throws him into the pool to ""sink or swim"".Billy and other soldiers are being marched to the mess hall and given a jovial welcome by English officers singing ""The Yanks are Here"". They are led into a dining room decorated with candles and with a potluck of potato soup, hot bread, pies, and marmalade. The English officer escorting Billy tells him the coat was a joke and to wear it with pride and how to hold his head high, despite the deplorable circumstances. Billy passes out at the suggestion.With the tune of the Andrews Sisters singing Johnny Fedora, Billy is at his new home in Ilium in spring and summer of 1947 playing with his new puppy, Spot, with his wife calling him for dinner twice. There is a party going on at his house a later night celebrating his new baby daughter, Barbara. He's obviously feeling out of place at the party with disinterested attendees and his wife chewing him out for the dog peeing on her leg. He takes the dog outside, sits at the lake, and sees a strange occurrence in the night sky, a beam of light coming to him, then leaving.It's back to the POW camp. Paul Lazzaro threatens Billy for Weary's death, but fellow soldier Edgar Derby intervenes. Derby is a middle-aged man of 44 years of age that gave up his job as a trade school teacher in Boston to fight in the war. He is a father figure to Billy and the two immediately form a close bond and friendship. Derby goes through Billy's coat and finds a partial denture and diamond of at least 2 carats.It is Billy and Valencia's anniversary at their home in the summer of 1964. He gives his wife a ring made by the diamond found in his coat. Billy is bored by the crowd and retreats inside his home. He catches his son in the bathroom looking at a porn magazine and scolds him for it. But afterwards, Billy looks at the magazine himself, smiling with delighted interest at the centerfold of Montana Wildhack and goes to the bedroom with it.Billy finds himself back at the POW camp in the briefing room with the rest of the soldiers to be told about the men's new assignment in Dresden and how lucky they are. Edgar Derby is nominated as their leader. Simultaneously, when Derby gives an acceptance speech, Billy is at a Lions Club meeting at his hometown in 1957 giving an acceptance speech.It's about 1964 or 1965 and Billy and his family are watching a soft-core porn flick with Montana Wildhack in it. Billy's son enjoys it and his wife is outraged at the filth. Billy pays no attention to her and is engrossed in it.Billy and fellow soldiers are in a boxcar on their way to Dresden and Derby is going over with him a letter he wrote to his wife about his service and about his pride in his son also serving in the South Pacific.About 1965 or 1966, Billy and his wife pull up to a cemetery with a police officer that caught his now-delinquent son and others vandalizing the tombstones and offers to pay off the officers for the damages.The soldiers pull up to the train station at Dresden, being led by an elderly German officer and several teenage proteges under his wing. They are marched to their new quarters through the beautiful city. A group of kids surround Billy while they are marching and an outraged elderly German civilian slaps him in the face, believing he is insulting his people with the coat he is wearing.It is February of 1968. Billy and fellow optometrists, to include his father in law, are about to take a chartered flight to Montreal for a convention. Billy sees visions of skiers in the crowd when waving goodbye and tells the pilots they need to stop the plane, because it will crash. They refuse to acknowledge, but the plane does crashBack to Dresden, the elderly German officer tells them of their quarters, Slaughterhouse Five, where they will be staying and what to shout in German in case of emergency.Billy is buried in the snow in the Green Mountains and a group of skiers find him bloodied and buried in the rubble.Billy's wife frantically pulls her 1967 Cadillac out of the driveway after hearing the news and comes to his rescue. She is so distressed that she misses her turn, backs into a Mercedes, drives the wrong side of the road, and causes numerous damage in vehicle accidents. She escapes the police, gets on the right side of the road, and goes forward, despite the fact the exhaust is ruined and spewing carbon monoxide. There is a brief flashback of Billy giving his wife the car for her birthday maybe a year or two earlier. Then the car pulls up to a hospital in Vermont and she crashes it into the garage, passed out from the carbon monoxide. Two nurses rescue her and bring her inside, with the gurney she's on passing the one Billy is on.Billy is being operated on and simultaneously, he and the fellow soldiers are in their slaughterhouse quarters being briefed about their working assignments by the German officer and daily routine of work. After the operation is over, the doctor that operated on Billy greets his daughter Barbara that everything will be okay. Barbara's husband Stanley comes over to her to give her the news that her mother died from carbon monoxide poisoning earlier.Billy is in his room recovering with an arrogant professor and historian for a roommate named B.C. Rumfoord telling his much-younger wife about being stuck in a room with such a weak and worthless man. He's writing a story on the bombing of Dresden and Billy says in a daze he was there, but Rumfoord couldn't care less. Simultaneously, Billy is blathering in German that he's an American Prisoner of War and Slaughterhouse Five. Rumfoord loses his temper and tells Billy the bombing was justified, while simultaneously, Billy as a young soldier is walking amidst a crowd of cheerful kids just hours before the bombing.The night of the bombing at dinner, an American dressed up in a Nazi uniform with American flag decor named Howard Campbell, is summoned to recruit the men for the Free American Corps, which is an allied unit with the Germans and that the Communists and Jews are their enemy. Derby calls him out on it for what a filthy traitor he really is, but before he can say anything more, an alarm goes off for the city and the men are ordered to evacuate to an underground cellar for shelter. Dresden gets bombed.In March 1968, Billy is taken home by his daughter Barbara and she pleads with him to stay with she and her husband, but he refuses. He is senile, listless, and apathetic at this point. He takes his elderly dog Spot and shuts the door in her face.The bombing is over and the soldiers go up the stairs to inspect the damage. Simultaneously, Billy is walking upstairs in his posh estate to his bedroom with his dog in his arms. The men walk outside. A teenage German soldier guarding their group denounces the bombers as filthy pigs in German and runs to rescue his family, who were already killed and he burns to death searching for them.Billy is laying in bed at his home with Spot and his son Robert has come to visit him. The former delinquent is now a sharp Green Beret in the Army fighting in Vietnam home on emergency leave. Robert is caring of him and trying to have a conversation, but Billy is preoccupied with himself, looking out the window at the night sky, and uninterested at his visiting, but assures him he's proud of him. Right after Robert leaves, the beam of light he saw in the sky while at the lake at his house in 1947 reappears and takes him away. He and his dog Spot are whisked away to a geodesic dome on the planet Tralfamadore. He's confounded as to his appearance there. The Tralfamadorian elder tells him he can't see them because they live in the Fourth Dimension and that he can't leave the dome. No reason why he is there, he just is.Billy and the American soldiers are ordered by the elderly German officer to process the corpses from the rubble of the bombed Dresden city and to collect their personal remains. They are given a direct order that any looting or stealing will result in firing squad. While Billy and the soldiers are collecting the bodies, he's on Tralfamadore telling the elder about the bombing and how it affected him, but he's comforted and assured that everything that happens always has and always will happen and that the past, present, and future are always happening at the same time in their world, which also gets destroyed and destroys the entire universe because of a mishap with one of their test pilots.Porn actress Montana Wildhack has now been added to the exhibit with Billy in the dome and she's scared to death at first not knowing what's happening. The Tralfamadorian elder insists that they mate, but Billy insists on being a Gentleman with her and does not follow the order. But she lets him go to bed with her and they make love.Some days later after the bombing, Derby finds an undamaged figurine in the rubble that is an exact replica of one his son broke before. He's caught by German officers and shot to death by firing squad. Billy tries to stop it to no avail.Billy is back on Tralfamadore with Montana in her new wardrobe. He tells her of his wife, that the thing he liked best about her was her pancakes. They want to have a baby together.It is back to March 1968 when Billy's daughter was frantically searching for him in his house. He, his daughter, and son in law are at the dining room table and she really thinks he's lost his mind about Tralfamadore and his son in law suggests seeing a psychiatrist. He assures them that the Tralfamadorians do not see past, present, and future the way Earthlings do. And also reveals to them the disappeared porn star Montana Wildhack is the love interest there and that he's seen his death.It is an unspecified time, perhaps the early 2000's. An elderly Billy Pilgrim in his 80's addresses a crowd at a high rise in Philadelphia about Tralfamadore and their lack of concept about time. And that a fellow soldier from World War 2 is about to kill him. Paul Lazzaro is now also a very elderly man that lives in the area shooting him sniper-style and instantly killing him.Billy wakes up to find himself amongst the remains to Dresden in April 1945 with Lazzaro and fellow soldiers attempting to steal a grandfather clock. He's assured all the Germans have left, but when in the process of stealing, Lazzaro and the others leave, with the clock toppling on Billy. It turns out the German side of the war is over and Russian soldiers give Billy a drink to celebrate, which he gagsBilly and Montana have a baby on Tralfamadore, with the entire planet celebrating with an array of fireworks"

Henry had heard stories from his mother about his Aunt Augusta, whom he had assumed had long passed. Information from Augusta about his ""mother"" and an action by Augusta's Sierra Leonean friend Wordsworth convince Henry to agree to Augusta's request to accompany her on an imminent trip to Paris, despite Henry never having done any international travelling. It isn't until they are well on their way that Henry learns that the purpose of Augusta's trip is not to sight-see as he had assumed he would do, but rather to save the only true love that she has ever had in her unusual and unique life, an Italian by the name of Ercole Visconti. As Augusta's task takes her and Henry far beyond just Paris and as they get into one adventure after another in Augusta's often less than above board actions, Augusta and Henry will either be torn apart by their fundamental differences, or brought closer together as they begin to understand the need to be a little more like the other, the only real family they have left in the world.

She invites him back to her apartment, where her lover, an African fortune teller named Zachary Wordsworth, is waiting for her. Shortly after she receives a package allegedly containing the severed finger of her true love, Ercole Viscont, with a note promising the two will be reunited upon payment of $100,000.Augusta asks Henry to accompany her to Paris, and he agrees, unaware she actually is smuggling £50,000 out of England and transporting it to Turkey for a gangster named Crowder in exchange for a £10,000 fee she can put toward the ransom.

The two board the Orient Express, where Henry meets Tooley, a young American hippie who takes a liking to him and gets him to smoke marijuana with her in her compartment.

Augusta attempts to secure the money she needs from her former lover Achille Dambreuse, but the wealthy Frenchman dies of a heart attack in her hotel suite before she achieves her goal. Efforts to extort $100,000 from Achille's widow in return for their silence about the adulterous circumstances of his death fail, and Augusta decides to sell a valuable portrait of herself she claims was painted by Amedeo Modigliani to raise the money.After an argument with Henry, Augusta lets it slip that he is Ercole's ""other son"". Once the painting is sold, they join Zachary on a fishing boat to North Africa, where they pay the ransom and are reunited with Ercole. He removes his bandages, revealing ear and finger intact, indicating he has been the mastermind of a plot to separate Augusta from her money.

He wants to use the cash he kept to purchase the portrait Augusta sold, but she tells him she would prefer to use it to finance more travels.

Clint is drunk, and causes a near collision with Pickett's canoe, which overturns. More than a little annoyed, Pickett hurls Clint into the water first chance he gets, much to the amusement of Karen.

They promise Pickett some dry clothes and offer for him to join their annual family celebration.

Due to his immense wealth, the members of his family are used to indulging his every whim, usually at the expense of their own dignity. Jason reluctantly welcomes Pickett, although it becomes clear that they are on opposite ends of the spectrum involving all things pertaining to nature. Pickett has respect for the natural world, while Jason seems furious that he cannot control it. The private island is experiencing an overpopulation of frogs and toads, which Jason is trying to curb by spreading various types of pesticides and poisons. Jason proudly calls himself and his family the ""ugly rich"", which seem to be true, as the various members of his family seem to be entirely self-absorbed and selfish. The one exception seems to be Karen, who doesn't take everything as seriously as the rest of her family. She and Pickett are attracted to one another.In private, Jason convinces Pickett to explore the island to examine the way the pesticides have affected the environment. He also asks him to look out for Grover, an employee he sent to the other side of the island to spray more poison and insecticides. While Pickett is hiking, he discovers hordes of dead animals, most of them snakes and frogs. After finding Grover's jeep, he finds Grover himself lying face down in a marsh, his body covered with writhing, poisonous snakes that cling to him possessively. After removing the snakes with a stick, Pickett turns him over to find him dead, his face horribly swollen and disfigured.After returning to the estate that evening, Pickett doesn't tell anybody about Grover's body until talking to Jason, who thanks him for keeping it quiet. The next morning, as the Crockett family begins to set up for the celebration, other fatalities begin to happen. Michael Crockett (David Gilliam), Jason's younger brother, goes out to check on a downed telephone line and suffers a hideous death. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg, which immobilizes him under a tree with scores of low-hanging moss. To his horror, a horde of tarantulas descend from the tree, biting him all over his body. The moss seems to act on its own as well, binding him tightly. The spider venom begins to paralyze him, and ultimately he is totally cocooned in moss and webs, the tarantulas presumably feeding on his body.Jason's older sister, Iris (Holly Irving), sends her son Kenneth (Nicholas Cortland) into the greenhouse to gather flowers for a centerpiece. While he is alone in there, scores of lizards enter behind him, swarming over the shelves and knocking over bottles of noxious chemicals until the liquids converge into a toxic cloud of gas, which asphyxiates him.A little later, Iris herself rushes off into the trees, chasing after a butterfly with a net; she is fond of creating dioramas using real insects and flowers, and she sees a butterfly she is anxious to add to her collection. She is stalked by several snakes, which dangle from from tree branches and approach along the ground. After a group of frogs frighten her off the path into the trees, the snakes attack, and she is confronted by a large rattlesnake. Driven further into the brush, she goes into a panic and stumbles through thick undergrowth, which destroys her hairstyle and clothing. She falls into a dirty ditch filled with leaves and filthy water, emerging covered in leeches. Bloodied from the leeches and disgusted by what has happened to herself, she wanders back to the path and is bitten on the arm by the rattlesnake, resulting in her immediate death.Nearby is Iris' husband, Stuart (George Skaff), who misses discovering her body by only a few feet. He is cornered by alligators and driven into a shallow marsh, where the gators kill and eat him.Back at the estate, Kenneth's body is discovered in the greenhouse, much to everybody's horror. His girlfriend, Bella (Judy Pace), is distraught and demands to leave immediately. Jason forbids Kenneth's death to interfere with the plans for the party, resulting in an immediate schism between those who want to leave and those who want to stay in order to placate Jason. Bella leaves with two of the servants, the long-suffering butler Charles (Lance Taylor Sr.) and cook Maybelle (Mae Mercer). Clint agrees to take them across the water in his speedboat to the mainland. Once they reach the other side, the three of them are attacked by seagulls.After looking around the bait and tackle shop on the pier which is deserted as well as the area, Clint returns to the boat only to see that the line has been tethered and it is drifting to the middle of the lake. Clint swims out to his where he is attacked and bitten to death by various water moccasins. His wife, Jenny (Lynn Borden), witnesses Clint's mishap through a pair of binoculars. Rushing down to the water's edge, she becomes stuck in the mud and is immediately attacked and killed by an alligator snapping turtle.Pickett and Karen realize there is no choice other than to leave. Jason remains belligerent, determined to continue with the 'celebration', furious that this bizarre course of events has interfered with his plans.Pickett and Karen head down to the water with Jenny's and Clint's young children, Jay and Tina (Hal Hodges, Dale Willingham). Pickett discovers Jenny's dead body floating in the shallow water, the turtle perched on her submerged head while crabs devour the exposed parts of her body. They shield the children from seeing Jenny's remains and usher them into Pickett's canoe. He paddles them across the water, although their escape is temporarily halted when the canoe becomes stuck on rocks and Pickett is attacked by water moccasins while dislodging it. He escapes unharmed, and they make it to the dock with Pickett fighting off more water moccasins with the paddle and shooting an alligator that attacks.Just beyond the dock area, the four survivors discover the luggage of Bella, Charles and Maybelle, leaving their ultimate fate undetermined. They reach a nearby road and flag down a passing car, driven by a mother and her young son. The mother offers them a ride to Jefferson City, and she says that the four of them are the only people they've seen for miles... suggesting that maybe the phenomenon is widespread. The boy shows them a large bullfrog that he acquired at summer camp where his mother picked him up...Back at the estate, Jason is now alone inside the mansion, save for his dog Colonel, surrounded by an increasing army of frogs outside as it begins to get dark. He listens to patriotic music on his Victrola record player, until frogs begin to crash through the glass of the windows. Although he tries to ignore them, the horror of the situation proves too much for him. As the frogs swarm over him, he falls out of his wheelchair and suffers a fatal heart attack on the floor. The frogs have succeeded in destroying their tormentor. In the final shot, all of the lights in the mansion flicker out... implying that nature has won and the rest of humanity is next."

(10 minutes)A man participates in a sex study at a local hospital and the whole experience ends up turning into one big farce (""Was It Good For You Too? (Green Pants, I Like the Look)"").

The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068655/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hapless orchestra player becomes an unwitting pawn of rival factions within the French secret service after he is chosen as a decoy by being identified as a super secret agent. Two factions of the French Secret Service involve a seemingly normal orchestra player, Francois Perrin, into their battle as one side uses him as a decoy. Soon, agents are all over the place, and one of them, Christine, is sent to seduce Francois. Meanwhile, Francois has his own problems, tangled up in an affair with his best friend's wife.—Kumar Bernard Milan (Bernard Blier), the second-in-command of France's Counter-Espionage department, is out to discredit his chief Louis Toulouse (Jean Rochefort) so that he can supplant him. When a French heroin smuggler who has been arrested in New York claims that the drug smuggling was a secret mission on the orders of French Counter-Espionage (actually on Milan's orders), the resulting bad press reflects on Toulouse, who cannot prove that Milan was responsible. In retaliation, Toulouse hatches a plot to deal with his ambitious subordinate: in a room which he knows is filled with hidden microphones, he sends his assistant Perrache (Paul Le Person) to Orly airport at 9:30 AM the next morning, making Milan (who has been listening) believe that Perrache has gone to meet a master spy who will expose Milan's treachery. However, Toulouse secretly instructs Perrache to choose someone at random from the crowd of travelers arriving at that time.After considering several possibilities from the flight arriving at the specified time, Perrache selects François Perrin (Pierre Richard), an unsuspecting violinist, who is noticeable because, as the result of a practical joke played on him by his fellow orchestra members, he has arrived wearing a black shoe on one foot and a reddish-brown one on the other. Milan takes the bait and immediately begins a series of attempts to find out what Perrin knows-never ever realizing the fact that Perrin knows nothing at all about espionage (although he is an expert on music).Milan's machinations involve Perrin in a series of increasingly peculiar adventures which he either avoids or escapes from by pure luck (which only confirm Milan's increasingly paranoid suspicions), and although Perrin is largely oblivious to the mayhem occurring around him he can't help noticing Milan's top agent, the beautiful femme fatale Christine. Adding to the confusion is the fact that Perrin is having an affair with Paulette Lefebvre (Colette Castel), the wife of his best friend Maurice (both of whom are musicians in the same orchestra as Perrin), and Maurice, upon accidentally hearing a recording of Perrin and Paulette having torrid sex (made by Milan's agents and listened to inside a floral delivery truck), jumps to the mistaken conclusion that Paulette is having an affair with a florist. All the time, Toulouse and Perrache watch the chaos serenely, although Perrache is troubled by his chief's callousness toward the risk that Perrin might be killed.In a startling scene, Christine greets Perrin at her apartment's front door in a demure high-necked black-velvet dress, then turns around and shows that the dress is backless, displaying discreet buttock cleavage (a similar dress is seen once again-at a symphony concert-in the sequel film 'Le Retour du Grand Blond'). A slapstick love scene (watched by Milan and his cohorts on a television monitor) ensues, concluding with Milan's decision (despite Christine's belief that Perrin couldn't possibly be an agent) to have Perrin eliminated. More mayhem (including Maurice's learning the truth about his wife's affair) and treachery (including Christine's defection from Milan's group to save Perrin, with whom she has fallen in love) follow, climaxing in the deaths of not only agents from both Toulouse's and Milan's groups but also Milan himself, who only learns the truth about Perrin from Perrache just before he dies. Realizing how he has been fooled, Milan dies with a smile of appreciation. Maurice, who has repeatedly walked in on the aftermaths of the shoot-outs in Perrin's apartment, suffers a total mental breakdown.The film ends as it began, at Orly airport. Perrin pushes a huge Louis Vuitton steamer trunk in an airport luggage cart, talking softly to Christine, who is hidden inside. Their destination is Rio, Brazil. Toulouse, who has been watching Perrin's departure on a monitor, instructs Perrache to contact Perrin when Perrin returns, remarking ""After all, he handles himself pretty well."""
I Want What I Want,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068726/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A 20-something son of a military officer feels like a woman trapped in a man's body. When he can hide it no longer, he falls out with his ladies'-man father and leaves home. Now what?"
Sisters,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070698/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A small-time reporter tries to convince the police she saw a murder in the apartment across from hers. The Staten Island apartment of lovely model Danielle becomes the scene of a grisly murder that is witnessed by her neighbor, Grace, a reporter. But the police don't believe her story, so it's up to Grace to solve the murder mystery on her own.—alarmanwp Grace Collier is a columnist with the Staten Island Panorama. She generally works on fluff pieces, but on occasion is allowed to do hard hitting stories which she prefers. From her apartment window one morning, she sees what she is certain is the stabbing murder of a black man by a white woman in an apartment across the way, the black man, seeing her, who tried to scrawl the word ""help"" in his own blood on the window. Reporting what she saw to the police, Grace gets little help from them, with who she has a bad relationship if only because of previous stories she has written on police brutality and racism. When the police and Grace arrive at the apartment in question, they find no dead body, no blood, and no woman matching who Grace saw commit the murder. All they find is the tenant, Danielle Breton, a young French-Canadian model/actress, who is visited by her soon to be ex-husband, Emil Breton. However, what Grace saw truly did happen, the dead man being Phillip Woode, a man Danielle just met on her latest job on a game show and her sex partner for the evening, and the murderess being Danielle's twin sister, Dominique Blanchion, who is possessive of her sister. Emil helped Danielle cover up the murder. Grace, with the help of a private investigator named Joseph Larch, tries to find out what is going on, including where the dead body is, which Grace believes they could not have moved out of the apartment between the time she saw the murder and when she and the police initially arrived on the scene. If Grace and Larch find out the truth, they will learn of an unusual relationship between Danielle, Dominique and Emil, one with strong psychological overtones based on the scar Danielle has on her right hip. And even if Grace and/or Larch discover the truth, they may not survive what Emil in particular is willing to hide at any cost to protect Danielle.—Huggo Margot Kidder is Danielle, a beautiful model separated from her Siamese twin, Dominique. When a hotshot reporter (Jennifer Salt) suspects Dominique of a brutal murder, she becomes dangerously ensnared in the sisters' insidious sibling bond. A scary and stylish dissection of female crisis, Brian De Palma's first foray into horror voyeurism is a stunning amalgam of split-screen effects, bloody birthday cakes, and a chilling score by frequent Alfred Hitchcock collaborator Bernard Herrmann. Danielle Breton, a beautiful young model, meets an attractive young advertising rep on a Manhattan game show and he escorts her to her home to Staten Island. The next day, her neighbor Grace Collier, a local reporter, witnesses a bloodbath of violence in Danielle's apartment - and can't get anyone to believe her. With the help of a private detective, Grace attempts to solve the mystery.—alfiehitchie Danielle Breton (Margot Kidder) is a model and would-be-actress hired to pretend that she is a blind woman so that an inssurance seller Philip Woode (Lisle Wilson) would have to decide if he is going to look her undressing or not as part of The Peeping Toms, a hidden camera programme. He doesn't look to her at the changing rooms of his gym, so both win a price in the programme. Philip wins a dinner-for-two at the African Room restaurant, and Danielle wins a cutlery set. After the programme, Danielle and Philip seem to hit it on, so Philip invites her to the dinner.At the restaurant, they are interrupted by Danielle's ex-husband Emil Breton (William ""Bill"" Finlay), but Philip makes him be overthrown from the restaurant. Later, Danielle and Philip go to the former's apartment in Staten Island. The ex-husband follows them, so that Philip has to leave the apartment, make believe that he's leaving for good and then coming back through the back door. When he comes back, Philip opens the door with Danielle's keys, and at the same time he gives the cutlery gift - which Danielle had left in his car - to her. Philip and Danielle make love in the couch of the living room.The next morning Danielle wakes up and he isn't feeling that well. He goes to the medicine box in the bathroom and checks that there are only three red pills left. She takes one immediately and leaves the other two in a corner of the washbasin. However, when Philip also wakes up and dresses himself he throws the other two pills down the sink. Philip overhears Danielle and her sister Dominique fighting and arguing about him. Danielle says she isn't feeling that well, and would please Philip go for more red pills to the chemist's? Philip complies and loses more time because he wants to buy a present for Danielle and her twin sister Dominique, who is supposedly visiting Danielle - although during the game show she said that she was dead.Philip returns to the apartment and unlocks the door with Danielle's key again. She takes the big knife from the cutlery set and offers it to Danielle to cut up the birthday cake. However, she uses the knife to viciously kill him. Philip crawls trying to call her neighbour's attention - her wind is a bit higher but close enough for both tenants to see each other. Philip even tries to write HELP with her own blood in the window.The neighbour is Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt) a journalist who usually writes about the state of things in Staten Island, sometimes to criticize the police officers and their use of violence. So Detective Kelly (Dolph Sweet) is not very kind towards Grace's agitation. Meanwhile, Danielle wakes up confused and dazzled. She has tried to talk to her doctor, who promises to bring her more of the red pills.Emil comes up to the apartment. Danielle opens the door up, still feeling sleepy. When Emil points to the corpse behind, Danielle says that Dominique was there. Emil, who is at the same time Danielle's doctor and the provider of pills, cleans the apartment up while Danielle dresses up.They put the corpse inside the bed-sofa. Emil laves and takes the bloodied knife away. When Detective Kelly and Grace appear, there is not a stain in sight. Danielle is kind, and the only remains of the corpse is a red stain on the back of the fouton where Grace is sitting down. Danielle justifies the double sets of matching clothes due to her job as model, because if one of them gets stained, they would have a completely equal outfit available. Grace finds the cake in the fridge. Also, Danielle had said that she lives on her own, and that's the opportunity for Grace to prove that she is lying. However, Grace falls down and smashes the cake against detective Kelly's leg. Emil appears, saying that they are separating but that they are not still divorced.Detective Kelly tells Grace not to disturb him or Danielle again with that matter. The only clue Grace has got at this moment is that she has read the name of the bakery where Philip bought that cake. She had a date with her mother, annoying Mrs Collier (Mary Davenport), who mentions a new open-door psychiatrict hospital which has been opend in Staten Island. But Grace is not listening to her. When they arrive to the bakery, she jumps to ask the shop assistants (Olympia Dukakis and Justine Johnston), but the only thing that she learns is that there was a black man who had bought that particular cake dedicated to Danielle and Dominique on their birthdays.Grace hires a private detective called Joseph Larch (Charles Durning), who says that the only possibility of hiding a body is within the sofa. Grace tells him that he has found the Blanchion Siamese twins, but the detective says that he didn't see any twins, he has only found a place in which a human body could be hidden without the police finding it.Grace talks to a doctor, Arthur McLennen (Barnard Hughes) who studied the case of the Blanchion Siamese twins, the first set of twins of Canadian origin. Dr Pierre Milius - Emil's younger persona - appears on a news report talking about the delicate psychological mental equilibrium of one of them. As teenagers, Danielle is shy, but Dominique is more talkative and shows off more. McLennen says that, because of the official silence, he had bribed one of the nurses who helped during the surgery, and that nurse told him that there complications had arisen during the process, resulting in Dominique's death.Larch keeps on watching the strange movements in Danielle's apartment. Grace follows Danielle to the hospital sight. There, she overhears a discussion of Emil and Danielle having a row, because she's fed-up of being controlled. She sees how she puts an injection to her, forcibly. Grace tries to use the phone, but one of the interns doesn't let her. Arlene (Cathy Berry), the crazy patient, says that viri and bacteria go through the telephone line, and that she got sick because of answering the phone. A hospital attendant (Burt Richards) asks his boss to see to the problem. Emil tells Jansen, the hospital attendant, that she's the new patient, Margaret, and that she should be put in a room. Grace tries to explain, but it's useless, she's not believed. Emil hypnotises her so that she will believe that everything was a strange dream of hers.Grace appears now on the dreams /reminiscences about Danielle's life while attached to Dominique. Danielle suffered because when she started to be in love with her doctor, she realised that her twin sister will not accept the risk of surgery, and that she will not accept her being in love with somebody else either.Grace wakes up and screams. Danielle also wakes up, dazed. She wants Dominique back, but she is also afraid of her attacking Emil. Emil says that, every time he tried to make love to Danielle, Danielle became Dominique, furious and enraged. Danielle tries to run away from Danielle, He shows her the knife, still bloodstained. Danielle - possibly thinking she's Dominique - picks up a scalpel and cuts Emil's skin. Emil tries to kill Danielle but he bleeds to death instead. All t his happens in the presence of a dizzy Grace who wakes up in time to see Danielle hugging to a dead Emil, still bleeding. Grace screams.Emil is taken away in an ambulance, dead. Danielle denies that she has killed anyone in her life, and she also states that her sister died last Spring. Grace Collier is taken away, dazed and confused.Some time afterwards, Kelly tries to talk to recovering Grace. Danielle has confessed to killing Emil, but he admits that they have problems to detect who the black man could be. However, Grace repeats what Emil has taught her through hypnotism: that she couldn't have possibly seen such a corpse because there was no murder to begin with, and her mother supports him.The shrouded sofa appears in a semi-abandoned semi-dereclict countryside train stating, with a cow chewing peacefully nearby. Detective Kelly watches the sofa, thinking that some day the culprit will arrive to get rid of the sofa and the body for good."

The Legend of Boggy Creek,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068837/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A documentary-style drama about the ""Fouke Monster"", a Bigfoot-type creature that has been sighted in and around Fouke, Arkansas since the 1950s. A documentary-style drama which questions the existence of a monster in an Arkansas swamp. It is really more of a glimpse at lower-class swamp culture from the seventies, though, than a monster flick.—Sean Taylor <st52@cornell.edu> An early 1970's docudrama about a Sasquatch-type creature that terrorized the small town of Fouke, Arkansas for several years. Many of the persons who claim to have experienced these events actually played themselves in this movie version. The film had a big premiere in Fouke and went on to become a minor drive-in hit, grossing over $20 million domestically and appearing repeatedly on many late-night horror TV slots throughout the rest of the 70s, and spawning two sequels and a remake. In addition, the film's visual style is cited as the inspiration for the look and pacing of 'The Blair Witch Project'.—<Tyler@rccinc.com> In the lush backwoods region of Texarkana, Arkansas, local men scorn the legend of the Fouke Monster, named for the 350-person town in which it has been spotted, a giant, three-toed, Sasquatch-like creature that terrorizes local fauna. Jim (Chuck Pierce Jr.), a seven-year-old country boy, is sent by his mother to get help from some of the townsmen after she spots the monster near her house. Receiving no help from the skeptical men, Jim hears the monster scream, and, years later, as an adult, states, ""It scared me then and it scares me now.""Other residents are introduced and the incidents in which the monster was seen or heard are recounted. First shown are Smokey Crabtree and his son Travis, trappers who live near the creek and subsist off the fertile land, which provides a pleasant home for them until the sun goes down, after which they spot the monster.John P. Hixon describes seeing the creature, which has been shot in the chest, flee on two legs.John W. Oates relates that something killed his 200-pound hogs, strangling the heavy animals and carrying them off with ease.Jim recalls that the creek often flooded during his childhood, covering densely thicket-ed bottom-land that sheltered a multitude of creatures. Few humans could make their way into the swamp depths, where the monster was rumored to live. According to the monster's legend, which has evoked terror over the past fifteen years, the creature prowls the swamps and creeps out occasionally at dusk.Hunter Fred Crabtree (Jeff Crabtree) once saw the Fouke Monster and now reports: ""Assuming it is a wild man or a gorilla"", he refrains from shooting it in case it is human. A few months later, Fred's uncle, James Crabtree (James 'Buddy' Crabtree), is hunting when he glimpses the monster, which steps out in front of him without fear.Mary Beth Searcy (Judy Baltom) lives with her baby and older sister, and one night when the women are alone, Mary Beth hears howling outside and notices that the livestock are agitated. When she sees the creature through the living room window, she screams, faints, then spends a long night of terror as the women await sunrise. In the morning, they find their cat dead from fright.Later, a thirteen-year-old boy rushes into the woods after what he believes is a deer. Spotting the monster, he shoots it and flees, after which the creature limps off into the woods leaving bloodstains behind. The community springs into action, bringing in prized hunting dogs from all around. Jim accompanies the search party, which is covered by the local media. Although the dogs eventually catch the creatures scent, they are too frightened to track it. Jim notes that the creature never harmed a human and remained non-aggressive until people tried to kill it. After the hunt, the creature disappears, apparently moving deeper into the bottom-land.Eight years later, Travis visits Herb Jones, who lives in solitude by the creek. Although Herb is sure the Fouke Monster is a myth, a young couple sees it run across the road as they are driving, and later Ol H. Kennedy finds three-toed footsteps in his bean field, garnering national press coverage. Some experts compare the creature to Sasquatch, but the feet are different, as are the feet of gorillas.Bessie Smith's children are playing in the woods one day when they run home and insist that she accompany them to see what they have found. When she catches sight of the creature, she screams and they all run back to the house.Teenager Nancy invites two girl friends over to her trailer one night, and as they chatter, the creature stalks outside. Hearing it draw closer, they scream and grab a rifle, but are too terrified to load it. The creature smashes flowerpots throughout the night, and the next morning, the parents return to find the girls mute from shock.In another incident, Charles and Anne Turner and Don and Sue Ford and their small children rent a house together. While the men are away working, the wives hear the creature on the porch, but landlord Mr. Johnson assures them that they heard only the wind. Later, when Bobby Ford and his young cousin arrive for a weekend of fishing, they spot a footprint, causing them to retreat nervously to the house. The next day, they all hear the creature outside and take preparations against it, then, when Don and Charles return, they search outside with a rifle. The creature approaches, creating confusion that causes the men to shoot at it continuously.The next day, the sheriff declares that it was a panther, but later that night, Bobby sees the creature through the bathroom window. As the women scream, the men shoot over and over, then traipse outside to see if they have hit their prey. Just then, the creature attacks, and in his panic Bobby runs through the glass front door. As he is brought to the hospital for his cuts, the Texarkana police investigate, but find nothing.As an adult, Jim returns to the area, examining the couples long-abandoned home. Wondering what the creature was after, Jim experiences chills down his spine while recalling the terrible, lonesome cry. ""You may believe the whole thing is a hoax"", he says. ""But if you're ever driving down here, keep your eyes out for a creature watching from the shadows."""

Top of the Heap,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180254/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A D.C. black cop is pushed over the edge when he is passed over for a promotion, leading him on a violent personal crusade against criminals punctuated by feverish psychedelic dream visions. Christopher St. Johnwrote, produced, directed, and stars in this unique, unsung blend of psychological thriller and Afrofuturist fantasy. George (St. John) is a police officer in Washington, D.C., who struggles to find his place both within the largely white institution of the force and within a Black community that distrusts cops. When he is passed over for a promotion, it pushes George over the edge, leading him on a violent personal crusade against criminals punctuated by feverish psychedelic dream visions. During a Washington, D.C. riot between construction workers and hippies, policeman George Lattimer is hit in the face with a urine-filled balloon while trying to contain the violence. George, whose mother has recently died, endures racism both from whites, such as the police force superiors who pass him over for promotion, and from blacks, many of whom consider him a sell-out for joining the force. Later at home, George is further frustrated by his wife Viola, who wants him to talk to their thirteen-year-old daughter Valerie about her recent activities with boys. When George dismisses the incident as unimportant, Vi snaps, ""All you care about is playing the big nigger cop."" Out on the beat, George escapes the prattle of his partner, Bobby Gelman, by imagining himself as a NASA astronaut, one of an elite ""Top of the Heap"" group scheduled to walk on the moon. Later, George busts two black drug dealers who try to bribe him and call him a ""black pig"" when he refuses. After hearing their words ring in his ears all night, the next day he shows up for overtime duty guarding War Department employees. Once again George fantasizes that he is walking on the moon, with Bobby as his astronaut partner, planting a flag upside-down. After Bobby litters and George falls into a crater, the scene is revealed to be a movie set. Back in reality, George declares to Bobby that the sergeants' exam is pointless, remaining convinced that he will never be promoted despite Bobby's insistence that he must simply learn to ""play the game."" They are passing a bar when a man with a knife races out, nearly knocking them over. George gives chase and corners the large man in an alley, managing to subdue him and then holding him at gunpoint. After Bobby arrests the man, however, George realizes that his gun had no bullets, and imagines the man stabbing him to death. For comfort, he visits his girl friend, a nightclub singer, but is disgusted that she is high. Nonetheless, he tries to make love to her, but when she pushes him away, he throws down some cash and stalks out. On George's bus ride home, the driver accuses a black man of underpaying the fare, causing the man to threaten the driver. When the man reaches for something inside his jacket, George pins him down, only to discover it is not a gun the man has but a bottle of wine. The driver, not realizing that George. whose jacket covers his uniform, is a policeman, calls the police, and the white officer who responds roughly stops George as he exits the bus. George explains that he is a policeman, but the suspicious officer holds a cocked gun to his throat until he finds George's badge, then apologizes feebly. At home, George dreams that he is running naked through the jungle with the singer, eating watermelon. The next night, George sees Bobby accept a bribe, and refuses to take a cut of the money. He returns home to find the door open, and after inspecting the house, notices Valerie prone on the bed. Deducing that she is high, he searches her purse and find some pills. As he puts her to bed, she states that he does not care what she does. When he then sees a dealer on the street the next day, George beats him viciously, but the man merely spits racial epithets and laughs. Soon, George is disciplined by his captain, Walsh, who assumes his anger comes from grief over his mother's death. To escape, George imagines himself as the astronaut, telling the press that he is naming the moon module after his friend Richard, a White House janitor. When the press question him about the scientific nature of the mission, however, the astronaut cannot answer and instead lights a marijuana cigarette. George has injured his hand while punching the dealer and now visits a clinic for treatment. The nurse is initially rude to him, but after she sees his gun she arranges for him to see a doctor. While waiting, he fantasizes that he is the astronaut who has been hospitalized after his space module exploded. He first tells his NASA supervisor, Walsh, that there was no indication of machine malfunction but he heard a voice telling him to ""get out of the machine,"" so he bailed out minutes before it exploded. When Walsh leaves, the astronaut seduces a blonde nurse named Beulah May Swenson. After seeing the doctor, George drives home, almost hitting a taxi along the way. The driver jumps out and verbally abuses him, demanding a fight until he sees George's uniform, then apologizes profusely. Later, George visits his old supervisor, Tim Cassidy, in his retirement home. Tim, lonely and bereft, calls the home a prison and delights when George pulls out a bottle of bourbon. Hours later, a drunken Tim gives George a shoebox containing his old gun as a gift. George calls on the singer, and after drinking and dancing, they make love. As he is leaving, she takes a photograph of him but he violently knocks the camera out of her hands. That night, he tells Viola that he will not go to Alabama for his mother's funeral, then imagines Bobby driving him there in a hearse, but despite his status as a famous astronaut, no one is there to greet him. ""Don't you realize that I've walked on the moon?"" he shouts, then, spotting his mother in the middle of the street, runs to her and weeps in her lap. His mother dances with him, then becomes an African dancer. Back at home, George relives all of the slurs he has suffered over the past few days and announces to Vi that he is quitting the force. Vi asks how he plans to support them, and when George counters that he no longer cares about money, only about not being hated, she retorts that that he is mean and selfish. George walks the streets, envisaging himself in an astronaut uniform, running through city, then in African garb giving a speech about how no man can be a slave or a judge. He goes to the bar where the singer is practicing and asks her to leave with him, inciting the ire of the bar manager. George fights both the manager and the bouncer, then drags the singer to his car and drives erratically, telling her he is going to the moon. When he asks her to run away with him, he is saddened to hear her respond almost exactly as Vi has, attacking him for wanting to take her away without being able to support her. Two policemen spot George speeding and give chase, and after he expertly eludes them, he drops off the singer and drives away. Wandering the National Mall, he hears a child's voice reciting the Gettysburg Address at the Lincoln Monument, then returns home, chastened and exhausted. Leaving for work the next day, he tells Vi that now he has ""got it together,"" but feels broken and unsure. While patrolling with Bobby, George strolls into an abandoned warehouse, daydreaming that an assassin is aiming at him. As he is shot in his dream, a hidden criminal guns him down in the warehouse, and George collapses, dead."

On an agreement with his controlling and judgmental widowed mother Florence, Don's new living arrangement is on a two month trial basis with Florence not to visit Don within that time period. Florence thinks that Don's trial is doomed for failure. One month into the trial, Linda is no longer in Don's life. But free spirited nineteen year old Jill Tanner moves into the apartment next door to Don. The two have an instant rapport, so much so that they decide to unlock the door that joins their two apartments together.

The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068528/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A middle-aged misfit struggles to raise her daughters, one popular and the other a promising science student. From the Pullizer Prize winning play by Paul Zindel, this is the story of Beatrice Hunsdorfer and her daughters, Ruth and Matilda. A middle-aged widowed eccentric, Beatrice is looking for her life in the classified ads while all about her is the rubble of an unkempt house. All she needs is the right opportunity, she says puffing on a cigarette. Poorly equipped to survive the vagaries of modern life, she has nonetheless always managed to muddle through. Ruth, epileptic and making her way through the rebellious phase of adolescence, seems doomed to make the same mistakes as her mother. Quiet Matilda, on the other hand, seeks refuge in her animals and her schoolwork. ""Jesus, don't you hate the world, Matilda?"" Beatrice asks her youngest daughter. The title of the film is also the subject of Matilda's science project at school and serves as a metaphor for the way life affects each of us differently -- how some are able to find opportunity in adversity and thrive and how some succumb when the burden becomes too heavy. This is the story of slowly drowning and grasping desperately for a lifeline only to find that there's none there and you must save yourself. ""No, Mama,"" Matilda says, ""I don't hate the world."" (Nell Potts, who stars as Matilda, is the stage name of Eleanor Newman -- Joanne Woodward's real-life daughter. She also appeared as the young Rachel in *Rachel, Rachel*.)—Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu> Widowed Beatrice Hunsdorfer is miserable in her life, and in turn she has contempt for everyone around her. She blames everyone except herself for her problems, but most specifically her now deceased husband George who left her before he died. People who know her believe she's crazy. She dreams of a better life - mostly by wanting to open a tea room where she would sell what she believes would be her world famous cheesecake - while realistically not being able to achieve that dream as she lounges around her run down and unkempt house smoking, drinking, reading the personal ads in the newspaper, and somewhat taking care of her elderly boarder, which is how she makes ends meet. Her eldest daughter, Ruth Hunsdorfer, knows the reputation her mother has around town. Although she displays some teen-aged bravada, Ruth seems destined to be just like her mother. Beatrice's younger daughter, Matilda 'Tillie' Hunsdorfer, is the quiet, shy but intelligent offspring. Tillie is supported by her teacher, Mr. Goodman, in achieving academic excellence. The dysfunctional family dynamic is placed to the test in the lead up to the school's science fair awards ceremony, where Tillie's project on the effect of gamma rays on man-in-the-moon marigold seeds is one of five shortlisted for the grand prize, the resulting seedlings which seem to mirror the Hunsdorfer family itself.—Huggo"
Pink Flamingos,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069089/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Notorious Baltimore criminal and underground figure Divine goes up against a sleazy married couple who make a passionate attempt to humiliate her and seize her tabloid-given title as ""The Filthiest Person Alive"". Sleaze queen Divine lives in a caravan with her mad hippie son Crackers and her 250-pound mother Mama Edie, trying to rest quietly on their laurels as 'the filthiest people alive'. But competition is brewing in the form of Connie and Raymond Marble, who sell heroin to schoolchildren and kidnap and impregnate female hitchhikers, then sell the babies to lesbian couples. Finally, they challenge Divine directly, and battle commences.—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> While revelling in her undisputed success as the filthiest person alive, an in-depth cover story in one of the nation's sleaziest tabloids forces notorious beauty Divine to go underground. And sporting a stylish, fresh look, flamboyant Divine now goes by the name of Babs Johnson--she plans to lie low until the trouble passes while holed up in her inconspicuous hideout with her dysfunctional family. In the meantime, Divine is unaware that her sworn enemies--the villainous, green-with-envy Marbles--have spread their tentacles well beyond the city, trying their luck with abduction, pornography, drug-pushing, and all kinds of depravities. However, in this no-holds-barred battle for the coveted title, there can only be one winner. Who are the filthiest people alive?—Nick Riganas The filthiest person alive, Divine, is using the codename Babs Johnson while living in a trailer in the woods with her egg-craving mother Edie, her mad hippie son Crackers, and her traveling companion Cotton. Envious couple Connie and Raymond Marble abduct and impregnate female hitchhikers to sell their babies to lesbian couples; they invest the money they make from this in heroin that's sold in schools. They hire Cookie to have sex with Crackers and spy on Divine to compete for the title of The Filthiest People Alive. When the competition begins, Connie and Raymond Marble learn why Divine has this title.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In a trailer outside of Baltimore, Divine, under the alias of Babs Johnson, is hiding from the press after winning the title ""filthiest person alive''. Sharing her trailer retreat are her egg-loving mom Edie, her equally-criminal son Crackers, and her pal Cotton; neighborhood friendly Mr. Eggman visits Edie regularly. An upper-class couple, Raymond and Connie Marble, suddenly emerge to challenge Divine for her filthy title--and they are serious contenders indeed.—Josh R.S. Lech The film opens on a view of a pink trailer that seems to be located in a clearing near a rural wooded area. A voiceover narrator identifying himself as Mr. J (John Waters) discusses the current status of ""notorious beauty"" Divine (Divine), who has gotten tabloid attention due to her criminal career. The tabloids have given
Divine the title of ""Filthiest Person Alive"", and the coverage has forced her to disguise herself. She has adopted the alias of Babs Johnson and retreated to this rural trailer just outside Baltimore. She lives there with her son, Crackers (Danny Mills), and a young woman named Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce), whom Mr. J identifies as Divine's ""traveling companion"". Also living in the trailer is Edie (Edith Massey), Divine's obese, senile mother.Inside the trailer, Edie has awakened and calls out to Babs; Edie sleeps in a playpen in the living room, wearing nothing but a bra, girdle and underpants. Edie demands that Babs bring her eggs, and we come to
understand that Edie is obsessed with eggs. When Babs doesn't respond soon enough, Edie tries to get Cotton to bring her eggs. Babs appears first, wearing a garish outfit. Her hair is an unnatural bright yellow
color, with an unusually high hairline and a fall attached.Babs and Edie have a brief discussion, with Babs being very patient and accomodating of her obviously feeble-minded mother. Edie calls the trailer a ""train"", and worries about when the Egg Man (Paul Swift) is going to stop by. Babs assures her that they still have eggs that she can prepare for her.Mr. J then discusses Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary), whom he calls ""two jealous perverts"" who are insanely jealous of Divine's fame. Connie is a strange looking woman with hair dyed bright red. We meet her as she is conducting a strange job interview in her home. She tells a young woman named Sandy Sandstone (Nancy Crystal) that she cannot offer her employment because she does not know
enough about Divine; apparently, the Marbles intend to spy on Divine and learn details about her lifestyle. Connie is a snobbish woman who belittles Sandy and infuriates her until she storms out in a rage. The film cuts back and forth between Divine's family and the Marbles, as they progress on a collision course with one another.Divine and Crackers go into town to run errands in Divine's Coup De Ville. Along the way, they deliberately run a jogger (Steve Waters) off the road and pretend to pick up a soldier (Elia Katz) hitch-hiking home, pulling away at the last minute before he can get in the vehicle, much to the amusement of Divine.Connie then meets with a lesbian couple (one of them Pat Lefaiver) who have come to her to adopt a baby. While Connie is talking to them, she sends her servant, Channing (Channing Wilroy) into the basement. There are two young women imprisoned down there, one dead (Marina Melin) and one alive and enraged. The dead woman has just given birth and Channing takes the baby upstairs so Connie can sell it to the lesbian couple. Before he leaves, the surviving girl, Susie (Susan Walsh), verbally berates Channing and curses him for his role in her kidnapping. She, too, is pregnant, and Channing is the father. Channing impregnates the women and gets rid of the bodies when they die in childbirth.After she parks the car, Crackers goes off on his own to make a date he has with a young woman. In a small grocery store, Divine shoplifts a steak from the butcher counter by discarding the wrapping paper and concealing the meat under her dress between her legs. She strolls through downtown Baltimore and turns the heads of passersby, then walks through a suburban neighborhood and urinates on the front lawn of a large stately home.We then see Raymond Marble, whose long hair is dyed bright blue. Raymond has a fetish for indecent
exposure; he lurks outside of an office building and follows two young women as they walk to a park to eat
their lunch. Raymond sneaks up behind them while wearing a bizarre mask, then opens his long coat to
reveal his penis hanging outside his pants with a long piece of sausage attached to it. The girls run off screaming and he takes the purses they have left behind.Later, Raymond and Connie welcome Cookie (Cookie Mueller) to their home. Cookie is a young woman who tells the Marbles that she can get them information about Divine because she is Crackers's date for the afternoon. The Marbles reveal their scheme: learn about Divine's private life and find the best way to disgrace her, while simultaneously seizing her title as ""The Filthiest Person Alive"". The Marbles tell Cookie about their baby ring, and they reveal that they also own several pornography shops and front money to heroin pushers in elementary schools. They feel that this is much filthier than Divine, and are resentful of the attention she has gotten.Cookie and Crackers go back to the trailer, where Cookie has a private conversation with Edie. Edie reveals that it is Babs's birthday and a party is planned. She also tells Cookie a few things about their home life. Meanwhile, Crackers excitedly talks to Cotton about his date, and tells her he has something special planned. Cotton is a voyeur who likes to watch Crackers in sex acts with women, and insists that Crackers never touch her personally.After introducing her to Cotton, Crackers takes Cookie to the little shed behind the trailer that he uses as
a private bedroom. Inside, Crackers and Cookie are naked on the dirty cot, and Crackers shoves two live
chickens at Cookie's nude body while she screams in horror. The chickens claw large scratches on her body, and in the process become crushed and killed between the bodies of Crackers and Cookie. Crackers slits the throat of one chicken and the blood gets all over the two of them. Cotton watches all of this from the window of the shed, shuddering in ecstasy.Immediately afterwards, the Egg Man pays a visit to the trailer, calling out as he arrives. Edie hears him and becomes excited, screaming out for him as if she's afraid he will not stop otherwise. Cotton arrives and invites the Egg Man to Babs's birthday party, then she buys all of the Egg Man's eggs for Edie.Back at the Marbles, Raymond and Connie are making love by sucking each others toes, and we can see that their pubic hair is dyed to match the bright blue and red color of their hair. A phone call from Cookie interrupts them and she gives them the information she has collected about Divine's living arrangement and her birthday party. ""You have no idea what I had to go through to get that information!"" she tells them. The Marbles are thrilled that they know personal details about Divine, and they send her a surprise package in the mail--the address simply reads ""Babs Johnson, A Trailer, Phoenix, Maryland"".At the trailer, Divine prepares the steak she shoplifted and feeds it to her family. A postman (Bob Skidmore) interrupts their dinner, and Divine confronts him angrily, furious that someone has dared to approach the trailer. When he runs off, she unwraps the package to discover human excrement inside. A birthday card announces that Divine is no longer The Filthiest Person Alive. Divine flies into a rage, swearing vengeance for the obscene gesture.Connie and Raymond kidnap Linda (Linda Olgeirson), another young woman, after picking her up while hitch-hiking. They drug her and have Channing place her in the basement, where Susie begins to rant at him again. Channing, who is disgusted that part of his job is to have sex with unconscious women and get them
pregnant, has devised a new method: he masturbates into his hand and uses a syringe to inject the semen into Linda's vagina.Things progress. The Egg Man proposes marriage to Edie and she accepts, and he promises to take her to a large poultry factory for their honeymoon. The birthday party goes ahead as planned, with scores of guests indulging in all sorts of decadent behavior. Raymond and Connie, aware of the party, sneak up into the woods and watch from a distance as Divine snorts drugs with a friend, a woman performs a striptease with a snake, and in one of the movie's most memorable moments, a nude man throws his legs over his head an demonstrates his unusual ability to make his anus dilate rapidly over and over. Raymond and Connie are shocked at this display, and promptly phone the police to report Divine's party. The police arrive, but Divine and her group assassinate them with their bare hands, ripping their bodies apart and eating them raw as in ""Night of the Living Dead"".Connie and Raymond, gloating over the fact that they've called the cops on Divine, return home to discover Channing dressed in Connie's clothes, imitating both Raymond and Connie. Furious, they lock him in his ""room"", which is really just a closet. They then set out for their final act of vengeance: to burn down Divine's trailer. Raymond finds time to stop at the local park to commit another act of indecent exposure, but he is horrified when his victim, a lovely young woman putting on makeup in the park, opens her dress to reveal that ""she"" has male genitals. She laughs with glee as Raymond runs off.Divine and Crackers, having learned of the Marbles through gossip, invade the Marble residence, licking the furniture and rooms to ""curse"" the house. To further contaminate the dwelling, Divine and Crackers commit an act of incest, with Divine performing oral sex on him. They are interrupted by the sound of Channing, still locked inside the closet. They tie him up and intimidate him into telling them about Connie and Raymond. He also mentions the girls in the basement, and they take him downstairs to verify it. Sure enough, the imprisoned girls are there. Divine and Crackers disapprove of this variety of depravity committed by the Marbles, and they free the girls, allowing them to castrate Channing as an act of revenge.Meanwhile, the Marbles invade Divine's trailer, now empty due to Edie's departure with her new husband. They pour gasoline all over and ignite it, delighting in their final act of aggression toward their enemy. After the Marbles run off, Divine returns with Crackers and Cotton to find the trailer ablaze. Beside herself with sorrow and rage, she sets out to seize the Marbles immediately.When the Marbles return home, they discover their house has been contaminated. Their sofa and chair ""reject"" Connie and Raymond, spitting them onto the floor when they try and sit. The rest of the house reacts similarly as the Marbles walk through it in a panic. Discovering Channing's ""room"" empty, they wonder if he's set the girls free. In the basement pit, they find Channing's body, castrated and bled out. The girls are gone.Connie and Raymond assume the girls have sent for the police and they try to flee, but Divine, Cotton, and Crackers are waiting for them in the living room. They abduct the Marbles, tying them up and taping their mouths shut, and drag them back to the site of the trailer for a ""trial"" and execution.Divine summons the local tabloid press for exclusive coverage of the event. Representatives from three tabloids arrive and witness the mock trial for Connie and Raymond. Crackers and Cotton provide testimony and pronounce the verdict and punishment: guilty, with the death penalty to follow. After tarring and feathering the bound couple, Divine executes them with a handgun.The reporters thank her for the scoop and depart to write their articles, while Divine has a discussion with Cotton and Crackers about their next move. They decide to change their appearances and move to Boise. Mr. J discusses their reputation in the last scene of the movie, which depicts the trio preparing to leave Baltimore for Boise. Divine spots a small dog moving its bowels, and in one movement, she kneels down and picks up the excrement and puts it in her mouth, chewing it briefly before spitting it out. The camera zooms in for a closeup of her face as she smiles and ends the movie.Pat Moran...Patty Hitler (Party Guest In Nazi Uniform)Jack Walsh...Party GuestJackie Sidel...Party GuestJulie Munshauer...

In 1876, the Missouri legislature issues a pardon and amnesty to the James and Younger gangs despite many people considering them outlaws.

However, the railroad companies and banks still consider them outlaws and will take matters into their own hands if they come across the gangs. Prior to the pardon, Cole Younger had contemplated robbing the First National Bank in Northfield, Minnesota - what is considered the largest bank west of the Mississippi - but has now decided against it. Circumstances, including learning that Jesse James and his gang are going ahead with the robbery behind his back, and that the railroaders issuing a war against them which also includes bribing the legislature to revoke the pardon, make Cole change his mind.

Before she can even call her parents to let them know where she'll be, the lodge owners arrange her transport and she soon finds herself with two other young women as guests of a kindly old couple. The place is beautiful and the food is fantastic, but something just doesn't seem right. One of the guests has suddenly vanished, and the hosts are certainly reluctant to have anyone poking around the meat locker. Still, the barbecued ribs are delicious, so what's there to complain about?—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> Regina (Linda Gillen) is a lonely young college student. As the rest of the school is departing for spring break, Regina feels left out because she has nowhere to go for her time off. When she returns to her dormitory, she receives a letter informing her that she's won an all-expenses paid vacation to a small seaside resort. When she phones the number given, they tell her that she is to meet a small private plane that will take her to the resort that evening. With no time to plan, Regina hurries away without calling her family.After landing at the airport, Regina is driven to the resort by Baby John (John Neilson), the son of her hosts. Baby John seems to be somewhat slow, but he bonds with Regina when a police officer attempts to pull him over and they have an adventure in escaping him. Instead of being afraid, Regina seems to enjoy the excitement of the high speed chase.After arriving, Regina meets Henry and Evelyn Smith (Arthur Space,Mary Jackson), the proprietors of the ""resort"", which is a large seaside mansion. Regina also meets the other guests, who all happen to be attractive young females. Each night, the Smiths and the guests sit down to an extravagant dinner featuring some main course consisting of meat. The first night, Regina is terrified when she goes to the kitchen to look for antacid and Baby John bursts out of the large walk-in freezer with a wicked looking knife. Evelyn arrives and tells Regina and the others that the freezer is off limits.Regina enjoys the beach near the mansion and flirts with Baby John. However, she is shocked by his outlandish behavior; after reeling in a shark on his fishing line, Baby John beats it against a rock on the beach, killing it. Afterwards, he tells Regina ""I think I love you,"" and walks away.Regina starts to feel uneasy about the circumstances of her ""vacation"", especially the fact that nobody knows where she is. Evelyn initially tells Regina that the phone is out of order, but the naive Regina doesn't get suspicious until she notices that the other guests ""go home"" suddenly in the middle of each night. Pamela (Janet Wood) is the first to go, but after she has supposedly gone, Regina pokes around and finds Pamela's stylish black dress hanging in the carriage house behind the mansion. She also finds a typewriter, and she deduces that it was the very one on which her ""notification letter"" was composed. She finds a framed photograph of a man whom she recognizes as the pilot who flew her to the area.Regina befriends another guest named Edwina (Margaret Avery), and that night Edwina is drugged. The Smiths come to her room and carry her unconscious body downstairs into the large walk-in freezer in the kitchen, and immediately chopping sounds are heard.Regina is confused when she finds out that Edwina has ""gone home"" without a word just like the others, and Evelyn forbids her to use the telephone, disconnecting a phone call Regina makes to her mother. When Evelyn and Henry leave her alone with Baby John, Regina enters the forbidden walk-in freezer and discovers the decapitated heads of Edwina and Pamela, and she belatedly realizes what they've all been eating. When she tries to escape, she flags down a police officer (Michael Macready), who turns out to be another relative of the Smiths, and he takes her back to the mansion. But Baby John has become attached to Regina and tells the Smiths ""I want her, she's mine."" Evelyn tries to discourage this, but it's clear Baby John has made up his mind.Eventually it's Regina's turn to ""go home"", and there is a strange, unspoken challenge she must endure: she again sits down to a meal with the Smiths, this time knowing full well that it's human flesh on the plate. The elder Smiths watch her carefully to see if she could ever ""fit in"" with them and become a mate for Baby John, but when she can't eat the meat, she knows she will be killed that night. She convinces Baby John to help her escape, and the Smiths turn their dog on them. Baby John kills the dog but they are cornered in Henry's greenhouse. Baby John gets a spanking for helping Regina, and Henry comes after Regina with a meat cleaver. Evelyn tries to distract Baby John by pretending to weep over the corpse of the dog, while Henry chases Regina into a corner. It appears as if it's lights out for Regina, and blood splatters across the leaves of a nearby plant.But the epilogue reveals Regina and Baby John living at the mansion. Regina prepares meals for Baby John while he plays with trucks like a child. The camera pans into the large walk-in cooler, where we see the heads of Evelyn and Henry resting in the freezer. The cycle of flesh eating at the Red Wolf Inn will continue."
The Candidate,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068334/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Bill McKay is a candidate for the U.S. Senate from California. He has no hope of winning, so he is willing to tweak the establishment. Californian lawyer Bill McKay fights for the little man. His charisma and integrity get him noticed by the Democratic Party machine and he is persuaded to run for the Senate against an apparently unassailable incumbent. It's agreed he can handle it his own way, on his own terms. But once he's in the race and his prospects begin to improve, the deal starts to change.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Idealistic young lawyer Bill McKay (Robert Redford), thoroughly involved with civil rights, legal aid and ecology, agrees to run for the U.S. Senate - not to win, he tells himself, but to bring vital issues before the voters. He despises political deals and compromises, but when the possibility of victory overshadows what seemed like certain defeat, his integrity begins to weaken. A fascinating and dynamic character study showing all the inner conflicts of a decent man torn between his ambition and his conscience. It tells what it costs - emotionally, morally, financially - to run for public office, and conveys all the doubts, all the self deceptions and ultimately all the cynicism of a man who knows he has sold out for something he isn't sure he really wants. Oscar-winning screenplay by Jeremy Lardner.—alfiehitchie Handsome Bill McKay is not his father's son, his father being former California Governor, John J. McKay. An idealistic civil rights lawyer, Bill believes the political process is all style over substance, and thus he can accomplish more for the people, many of those disenfranchised, in his role as lawyer than politician. For the upcoming midterm election, Bill is approached by strategist Marvin Lucas to contest the Democratic nomination for the California senate seat, the actual election against wildly popular Republican incumbent, Crocker Jarmon. Marvin is able to sell Bill, with his supportive wife Nancy at his side, on the idea as he can easily win the nomination, but has no chance of winning the actual election against Jarmon and thus he can freely speak his mind to the California electorate. Bill's biggest condition is that his father not be involved at all, Bill not wanting his father's legacy to overshadow any of his own messages. Unfortunately for Bill, McKay Sr. may influence Bill's campaign whether or not he is directly involved. What Bill did not account for is that he has to make a credible showing or else his own reputation as a human being may be in jeopardy. So as the polls continually change for the good or bad for Bill, he may buckle under the pressure to become what he didn't want to be in the first place. His entire life, including his marriage, may also be totally taken over by the campaign process until election day.—Huggo Without a candidate to run for the senate seat against admired Republican Crocker Jarmon, campaign manager Marvin Lucas recruits leftist lawyer Bill McKay. McKay's appearance piques the public's interest and gradually Lucas pushes McKay toward a more centrist message. As McKay's original and honest platform gets watered down, his popularity increases so much that he is running even with Jarmon as Election Day approaches.—Jwelch5742"

Not aware that the substance is a piece of the Blob from the original 1958 incident in Pennsylvania, Chester stores the substance in a small metal container in his home freezer prior to taking in to the laboratory to be analyzed. When Marian takes the metal container out of the freezer and leaves it unattended on the kitchen counter, both she and Chester forget about it since Chester is planning to go away on a week-long fishing trip which he has stored several cans of beer in his fishing container. With both Chester and Marian distracted by their bickering, the substance thaws out and a red gelatinous substance oozes from the metal canister after consuming a small house fly. The small blob then quietly engulfs their pet kitten. Seemingly energized by the sustenance, the blob oozes out into the back yard, where Marian is searching for the kitten. As the creature grasps Marian's legs to engulf her, she faints in terror and succumbs, unknown to Chester, who is watching television in the living room.

Meanwhile, the blob, having already devoured the bowling alley mechanic, surges down all the lanes toward the terror-stricken people, who run for their lives.Bobby, Lisa and Fazio barricade themselves in a broadcast booth high above the adjacent ice rink, which is closed for repairs, and watch as dozens of people succumb to the fast-flowing blob. Using the speaker system, Bobby tells the sheriff and his men, who are waiting outside, that the blob is a giant single-celled animal that can ooze through cracks. As the sheriff and his men dress in riot gear to prepare to attack the creature, Bobby tries to electrocute it with a live wire, but does not succeed. Jones and his deputy shoot at the creature, which is unharmed and subsequently eats the deputy.Having devoured the remaining public in the facility, the blob seeps into the booth through a hole in the floor. Scrambling to get away from the creature, Bobby knocks over a small refrigerator and spills ice onto the blob, which shrinks from the cold. Realizing that the air conditioner in their truck must have been the reason the blob did not eat them earlier, Bobby and Lisa asks Fazio how to cool the rink to freeze the blob. Meanwhile outside, the sheriff, having lost contact with Bobby, assumes that he and the others have been eaten, and orders his men to dowse the building in gasoline so they can burn the blob, unaware that fire will have little effect on the creature. Inside, Bobby heroically climbs the ropes leading to the rink's switch box. Once the rink's cooling system is on, the blob freezes solid instantaneously.Bobby then runs out of the building just in time to stop the sheriff from setting it ablaze. Minutes later, the sheriff proudly stands on top of the mounds of the frozen blob to give a television interview about the shapeless monster that almost destroyed their town and possibly the world. Just under his feet, a small section of the blob defrosts from the camera light and begins to engulf the sheriff's boot.....THE END?"
Sweet Sugar,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069336/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Prostitute Sugar is set up by a corrupt politician. She is convinced of the futility of appealing her case in the courts and signs on to a chain gang run by the notorious Dr. John who performs cruel medical experiments on the people who work for him.—Eric Conrad <econrad@magnus.ohio-state.edu> Sugar (Phyllis Elizabeth Davis) is walking with two men, each holding one of her arms; they stop at the entrance of a downtown hotel, one man kisses her good-bye, and the other walks in with her. Up at the hotel room, the john offers her a marijuana cigarette, and she lights it up. He then excuses himself for a moment, and immediately the cops bust in and arrest her, for prostitution and drugs possession. She is not friendly to the two other women in her cell, an Asian looking girl, and a black woman, Simone (Ella Edwards), who, reflecting on her profession tells her, ""No matter who you put out for, it's still a business."" Anyway, Sugar offered a deal by the Police Inspector. She can accept to cut sugar cane for two years, or she can go to court and risk a lengthier jail sentence. She accepts the former. They're tossed into the back of an open truck with five other women, the last aboard a nervous, screeching brunette, and driven away to the Cana Verde plantation.The nervous girl takes advantage of the truck slowing at one point to clamber out and try to escape. Quickly chased down, she is beat up a bit, and is about to be raped by two guards, when Simone shows her breasts, and says, ""Why mess around with that scrawny thing when you could have me."" Simone leads one of the guards off and they have sex (off camera). The nervous girl returns to the truck, after being raped.
The guards at the farm are Max (Albert Cole), a profiteer with a mustache, and Rick (James Houghton), a younger and naive man. The Chief Guard is Burgos (Cliff Ormond), a big and tall man. When the women arrive at the plantation, Burgos gives them a quick orientation: ""Behave or bad things will happen to you."" He frisks some of them and then looks each one in the mouth as if buying a horse.Dr. John (Angus Duncan) appears on horseback to the women, and exchanges a few words with Mrs. Fara Ramirez (Jacqueline Giroux), a woman who arrives in a Mercedes-Benz driven by a chauffeur, and wearing a black dress and large brimmed hat . She is imprisoned because she killed a man - eventually her husband, going by her dress color. She talks back to Dr. John, and he is not pleased, showing his short temper. He lives in an over-decorated mansion on the property, with a butler named Wolfgang - a hint of a possible Nazi past. Another prisoner in the barracks is Dolores (Pamela Collins), a 17-year-old blonde sold into servitude by her uncle.The next day, the girls are dragged out to the fields for the first time. They all choose to wear surprisingly skimpy shorts and tank tops. Sugar takes a few minutes to flirt with the guards. The work is interrupted by an Inspector from the Ministry of Labor. No one complains to the inspector, because ""It's our first day at work"". But when Dr. John comes around, Dolores pleads her case to him. He agreed to looking into the matter.Dr. John calls for Sugar to be brought to his estate. He's waiting for her in his tub.. ""I know the secrets of undreamed of pleasures,"" he says by way of a come-on as he stands up. Sugar demurs. He persists, ""I don't think you understand the extent of my proposal."" She looks down at him. She spurns him, and he sends her away, very angry.Next day Burgos shows up at the women's barracks and asks for volunteers for a medical experiment. He actually gets a volunteer, but he rejects her, and just hauls all the women off to the house. The first called in the lab is Simone, who comes out of the lab shaky, and not telling a word. The second in is Sugar, who the doctor straps down on an examining table, aided by Wolfgang. He wires her up with electrodes and then pulls out a syringe. ""This is used in fertility rituals and as a cure for frigidity."" Sugar starts moaning and groaning. Dr. John urges her to let herself go. She starts moaning louder. A machine is measuring her response, and the indicator creeps upwards into red. Sugar apparently has an orgasm, and this overloads the system and the machine catches fire. The experiments stop there, by machine failure. Dolores, however, doesn't want to leave. Instead, she wants to talk over her case. He takes her into his lab and puts her on the table to examine her, ""It's perfectly alright. I'm a doctor. So tell me, were your parents very strict with you?"" he asks in a creepy tone. She says yes, and that she is a virgin. rips her shirt open, and rapes her (off screen). Dolores returns to the barracks unsteadily, and the other girls sympathize with her. Next day, Sugar takes on additional work to make up for the still shaky Dolores.On this work farm, male and female prisoners get to have weekly campfire get-together. This leads to assorted hook-ups. Max is selling drinks to the male prisoners, and soon two of them - a Brazilian and a Venezuelan - are drunk and fist-fighting over Sugar, who only shows despite at them.Then, Max sends Ricky to the river, where a brunette is waiting for him... Ricky starts telling her the story of the bear and Goldilocks in the forest, getting closer and closer to her, but when he whispers the last sentence to her ear, she knees him to the groin, and he falls back onto the river. All wet, he complaints to Max of the bad result he had been told was always successful with girls. Max shakes his head, ""No! No, you shithead! You got it backwards! It was supposed to be, and now I'm going to snatch a kiss!""Fara and Dolores duck away from the campfire for a little lesbian canoodling in the nearby stream, by a waterfall.Sugar plays cops and robbers with Carlos, a handsome guard, and they decide to have sex in Dr. John's bathtub, and his bed.
Simone gets together with Mojo, a powerful black male prisoner, whom she had told on their first encounter, ""I don't mess around with bush bunnies."" He tells her he is a sort of priest, and he seems to have extrasensory powers.Dr. John walks in on Sugar and Carlos fooling around. For punishment, he turns them over to Burgos who chains Sugar up between two trees and orders Carlos to whip her. Carlos refuses initially, but when Burgos starts to whip Sugar, Carlos agrees to do it . But it was a ruse. Carlos turns the whip on Burgos. At which point, Burgos pulls out his gun and empties it into Carlos' chest. Burgos then kicks the body, takes the hot gun barrel and shoves it down the front of Sugar's short shorts.That night in the women's barracks, Sugar, looking none the worse for the wear, gets up and sneaks away. She decides to sleep in a nearby clearing. She wakes up the next morning and resumes her escape attempt, but unfortunately, she walks right into a trap and ends up dangling from a tree branch by her leg. Sugar is recaptured.All the women will be punished, for failing to warn a guard that Sugar was running away. Dr. John likes to do medical experiments, so, he gathers the women together in a cell. Then he takes a small, orange and white house cat, and he injects it with a drug that ""reduces creatures to their primitive state."" In a moment, the cat screeches and meows. Dr. John hauls out a half-dozen other cats that he has also injected, and then his henchmen throw the cats into the cell with the women. The women catch the cats and roll on the floor fighting them off, and one by one they faint, scratched and covered in blood. All the while, Dr. John is laughing hysterically. The Chief Guard begs Dr. John to stop the assault before the women are too battered to work.The next day the gals are back at work in the field. During a work pause, Rick shows Max his discomfort for Carlos' killing. Simone in yellow shorts, shoves Sugar - in her low-cut top and jeans shorts - into the stream. Simone tells her, as an explanation, ""That's for the fun we had!"" Sugar pulls Simone by the arms, into the water, slaps and punches her. Knee deep in the water, they fistfight, and Dolores, who gets in the middle to separate them, takes a punch that was intended for Sugar, and drops down. Max and Ricky get in the stream and hold back Simone and Sugar, respectively. Dolores shouts at the contenders, trying to convey some sense into them, or Carlos' death would have been in vain.
The next is a shower scene. The women sport a few scars, but nothing serious. Dolores and Sugar start conspiring for a serious escape attempt.Sugar fakes an illness and pretends to collapse. Mojo carries her off accompanied by Dolores, Fara, and Simone. Sugar found some sort of charm necklace, and when Mojo sees it he performs a voodoo ritual. Suddenly Sugar's necklace seems to come to life and drag her several yards down a path. At the point where she stops, Mojo tells the others to dig. They find a mass grave. They confront Dr. John with two skulls, to demand ""no work quotas, higher wages, no deductions for food, and an end to the human experiments"". Otherwise, they will complain to the labor inspector in his next visit. Dr. John lamely answers that he needs time, and Simone says they have no patience to wait. As soon as they leave the house, Dr. John and Burgos start preparing the repression.Before the next campfire, Max is teaching Ricky another chemical secret to win over a girl's interest in sex, this time involving a sticking thumb. Ricky objects that the thumb is physical, not chemical. At the campfire, Mojo is explaining how his voodoo spell on Dr. John will work. He asks Sugar - wearing her low-cut blue mini dress and white shoes - to stand up, pretending she is the incarnation of John, and starts playing with her. Sugar goes along, and half dancing, half walking, she steps astride over his supine body. Simone - shoe-less and wearing the backless white mini dress of her arrest day - screeches and jumps at Sugar. The two roll on the hay covered ground, fighting and displaying their bare legs up to their white slips. The musicians do not stop the music. Sugar wins the first clash and stands up, only to be attacked again by the black girl. Mojo shouts at them to stop, and they do. Again Sugar stands up and walks away, but before she reaches the circle of musicians, Simone picks a piece of rock, and tries to bash Sugar's head from behind. One girl shouts a warning, so that Sugar is able to disarm the jealous black girl, and put her in an arm-lock combined with a strangle hold. Simone submits. Sugar whispers to her, ""I never wanted him!,"" and throws her to the ground.Max is again setting bets with four male prisoners on Rick's encounter with Flower in the woods. But Dolores eavesdrops their conversation, and informs Sugar, and then Fara. So, Ricky ends up meeting with Sugar, instead of Fara. And the result is against Max's bet.Meanwhile, Simone and Mojo sneak off together. They come across a bull's head impaled with a scalpel - a message from Dr. John to Mojo.After the campfire, the guards find Mojo missing, so they decide to search the women's barracks. They burst into the shower, but the naked women shriek and shoo them out, and the guards are apparently too shy to push the issue because it turns out that Mojo is hiding naked in the women's shower. Ater the guards leave, Mojo sneaks out of the women's barracks to do some other ritual. One guard stumbles onto the fugitive. Mojo turns out to be quick, he jumps out of the way of a gunshot. But while he manages to beat up one guard, he is ultimately beaten down by big monkey guard. They tie Mojo up and set him on fire.In the cafeteria next morning, Sugar tells the other women that Mojo has been captured, and killed. The girls keep calm. Simone stands up slowly, pulls out her machete, and chops off Burgos' left hand. Now the riot begins. The women have machetes, but the guards pull guns and manage to suppress things temporarily.Sugar cozies up to Rick and offers to run away with him, and robs his gun. In the meantime, some of the other girls steal some petrol and guns from the guards. They all meet up and raid Dr. John's house. They want to rescue Simone, who's being slowly roasted in a sugar cane cage over an open fire, while Dr. John watches, sitting in a throne-like chair. Sugar knocks Dr. John on the head and he faints. They release Simone and take Dr. John hostage.In the meantime, the other girls are setting the cane fields on fire. Dr. John comes to, and Sugar wants him to open a gun cabinet so she can get more firearms. Dr. John starts talking incoherently, ""Dr. John isn't allowed to touch guns. Mr. Burgos won't let Dr. John hold a gun."" Burgos tracks down the girls and tries to free Dr. John, but Sugar is expecting him and when he shows up, she runs him through with a sword.
The girls and the still-blubbering Dr. John make it to the motor pool. Ricky is waiting there to run off with Sugar. He's surprised to see her arrive with her friends and Dr. John, but he decides to help with the break out. Max stumbles onto the scene , and he too decides to help the escape. But the rest of the guards show up and demand the girls' surrender. The girls shoot their way out in a truck,Simone and Dr. John following behind in a jeep. Fara gets shot, but amazingly Sugar and Dolores manage to out-shoot a bunch of guards from the back of a moving truck, and they get away.Simone gets shot as she pulls out, and crashes the jeep into the compound's gate. This seems to revive Dr. John, as he starts taunting her, ""You're going to die, but I am immortal."" Simone proves him wrong when she machine-guns a petrol can, blowing up the jeep and killing herself and Dr. John while also blocking the guards from pursuing the truck.Ricky and Max drive Sugar and Dolores across the border. The women hide in the back of the truck, under a tarp. Ricky and Max have a debate over who will get Sugar first, but when they pull back the tarp, they find only Dolores.Sugar has jumped over the side some miles back. Sugar gets back in town, a man on each arm - just as she was in the first scene."

The tribe treats him viciously and uses him as a slave. The chief's daughter, Mayara, takes a liking to him, and her mother, who was a missionary child and speaks English, helps him escape. He encounters the fiancé of Mayara during his escape and kills him. He is captured again afterward, but Mayara chooses him as her next groom. He then decides to live with the tribe, protecting them and providing wisdom against modern dangers and a cannibal tribe they're at war with.—Helltopay27 John Bradley (Ivan Rassimov) is a British journalist and photographer on vacation in Bangkok, Thailand. He is first seen taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a kickboxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed the man in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probably sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. Bradley agrees to head back after one more day of traveling.That evening, Bradley falls asleep, and when he awakes the next day, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native Thai tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, Luhanà (Ong Ard), is told that the group has captured a large fish-man. At the village, Bradley is hung in the net from a high pole, where a group of young children hit him with bamboo stalks. While hanging, Bradley witnesses the execution of two war criminals by his captive tribe. The tribe is at war with another, even more primitive Burmese tribe of cannibals, whom are named the Kuru. Two of the Kuru cannibals have their tongues cut off in the village center. Bradley reacts with disgust, labeling the tribe as murderers.Still in the net and hanging for hours, Bradley notices that he has attracted the attention of Marayå (Me Me Lai), the beautiful and naked daughter of the chief who takes an immediate fascination with the stranger. She convinces her father that John is not a fish-man, just a man. Luhanà agrees to release Bradley as Marayå's slave. He is forced to stay locked in a shack for hours, where Taima (Prasitsak Singhara), Marayå's governess, introduces herself. Taima is a former missionary child and can speak English, and tells Bradley that soon he will be released, as Marayå will be married to a fellow tribesman, named Karen (Sulallewan Suxantat), in ten days. Luhanà interrupts the two and unties Bradley because it is the day of the Feast of the Sun. During the feast, a helicopter flies overhead. Bradley tries to be rescued, but he is subdued by other warriors, who nearly kill him. Marayå intervenes, however, protecting her property. The helicopter gives John hope, and he plans escape, which Taima agrees to eventually help him with.A month or so passes, as Bradley grows even more tense. During one day of labor, a building accident kills a young man. Bradley watches the funeral ceremonies and is again shocked by the actions of the natives. During the ceremony, Taima tells Bradley that now is his time to escape. He does, but Karen and a group of warriors chase after him. They corner him at a waterfall, where Bradley kills Karen. Again a helicopter flies by, and again John goes unnoticed. After Karen's death, the tribe decides to incorporate Bradley as one of them. He faces various rituals and tortures until he is finally released and accepted as a warrior, and he uses his knowledge of modern technology and medicine to help the tribe, but, as a result, becomes an enemy of the tribe's witch doctor (Song Suanhud). During this time, he and Marayå begin to become fond of each other, until Marayå must choose a new fiance. Of the tribe's warriors, Marayå chooses John Bradley, and the two are married. After the wedding, the two run into the wilderness where Bradley gets naked and has sex with Marayå. This ends up getting Marayå pregnant. During the conception, however, a black butterfly flew over the two lovers, a foreboding of ill fate.Six months after Bradley has been captured, he has finally accepted his new life with Marayå. However, this is also when the Burmese Kuru cannibals decide to strike. Two teenagers, a boy and a girl, are ambushed outside of the village by the Kuru. The girl is killed and the boy mortally wounded, but he still is able to inform the others of the attack before he dies. Bradley joins other warriors to eliminate the attack party, and they arrive to see the Kuru party consuming the young woman. The group attacks the cannibals, with Bradley participating in activities he earlier condemned. When Bradley returns, however, he learns that Marayå has fallen ill from the pregnancy and has been stricken blind. John believes the only way to save her is to take her back to civilization for modern medicinal treatment. Taima helps the two escape, but she is caught in doing so has her hand cut off as punishment. Bradley and Marayå are captured and forced to return to the village.Upon their return, Marayå goes into labor. Again Bradley rejects the witch doctor, sending him away from the ailing Marayå. At this time, the Kuru warriors return to attack the village. They set fire to many huts before John and the other warriors are able to react. In the ensuing and graphic climatic battle, Bradley takes Marayå to safety until the cannibals are fought back and withdraw. As John tries to comfort Marayå's pain, he points out a black butterfly overhead. Marayå then reveals the significance of the butterfly: death. Marayå finally gives birth, and dies shortly after. Bradley wanders aimlessly through the jungle upon his wife's death, only sadly recollecting memories of her. Again a helicopter flies overhead, and after a moment of contemplation, he takes cover with the rest of the tribe, deciding to stay with them, probably for life, to help them rebuild and live against the Kuru and the elements."

The Solaris mission has established a base on a planet that appears to host some kind of intelligence, but the details are hazy and very secret. After the mysterious demise of one of the three scientists on the base, the main character is sent out to replace him. He finds the station run-down and the two remaining scientists cold and secretive. When he also encounters his wife who has been dead for ten years, he begins to appreciate the baffling nature of the alien intelligence.—Dan Ellis Psychologist Kris Kelvin is sent to a space station orbiting the moon of a distant planet. Once built to hold over 80 people, the station now has only 3 occupants. The space station has long been a troublesome issue with many occupants suffering from delusions while there. Kelvin arrives to learn that one of the three, Gibarian, has died leaving only two others as inhabitants. Soon, Kelvin is also seeing things that cannot be.—garykmcd Kris Kelvin is a renowned psychologist, about to head to the space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Several years earlier Solaris was the focal point of scientific research. Then a research party met with a fatal accident while exploring the surface and a member of the rescue party reported seeing strange apparitions. This dimmed the scientific community's interest in the planet to the extent that the space station's crew has decreased from 85 to only 3. When Dr Kelvin arrives he immediately senses that something strange is afoot.—grantss A psychologist is sent to a space station orbiting a planet called Solaris to investigate the death of a doctor and the mental problems of cosmonauts on the station. He soon discovers that the water on the planet is a type of brain which brings out repressed memories and obsessions.—notoriousCASK This is the summary for the 169-minute English-subtitled dvd version.During the opening credits, the chorale-prelude in F minor by Johann Sebastian Bach is playing.Part One:Plants move gracefully through a flowing stream of water. A man, Chris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), stands silently amidst lush plant life and a rippling lake, observing the living beauty of nature. He walks back through a field, past a lake next to a free-standing wooden house. He washes his hands in the lake as he hears a car approaching. An older man, Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetskiy), and his young son (Vitalik Kerdimun) get out of the car and are greeted by Chris' father (Nikolay Grinko), who tells them that Chris makes an hour-long walk each morning. While the boy starts to play with a girl already present, inside the house, Berton explains he wants to discuss something with Chris: they are getting confusing messages from a station in orbit around the planet Solaris, to which Chris himself is scheduled to leave the next day. It begins to rain, but Chris remains outside, immersing himself in the falling drops with a background of singing birds and dripping water.While drying himself in the house, Chris is shown an old video from Berton, one which his father has already seen many times. In the video, a board of inquiry discusses an exploration mission on the planet Solaris. After 24 days, two scientists, Vishnyakov and Fechner, went missing over an ocean in their air vehicle. Due to adverse weather conditions, a massive search was called off, only Berton's craft carried on. When Berton returned to base, he arrived in deep shock, refusing to get near the ocean ever again. The next part of the video shows a young Berton giving his testimony: due to the adverse flying conditions, his craft had entered an extremely dense fog bank. When he finally cleared the fog, he noticed the ocean became still and transparent. A boiling substance arose from the water, and reshaped into many forms and colors, among which an elaborate garden. A film is started, made by Berton's craft, briefly showing the planet's ocean and some boiling white foam, but to everyone's surprise, the rest of the footage shows only the fog that Berton mentioned. One of the scientists on the board mentions that the bio-magnetic current of the ocean, which is hypothesized to be the planet's cerebral system, may have interfered with the camera, but others imply that Berton may have been imagining things. The next part of the video shows an apprehensive Berton describing a twelve feet high shape of an unknown newborn infant appearing on the water surface. The scientists, however, explained away this experience as an elaborate hallucination caused by the atmospheric influence of the planet; however, one of the scientists, professor Messenger (Georgiy Teykh), contends this explanation, and calls for additional probing of the planet. It is implied by his argumentation that many years of study of the planet (called Solaristics) have actually yielded very little understanding of Solaris, as the researchers are painfully confronted with the limits of their knowledge. Despite professor Messenger's argumentation, the board decides to discontinue all research activities on the planet.Berton stops the tape, stating that his story is still ridiculed. He requests to talk to Chris alone, and will be waiting outside. Chris' father laments that he and Chris have seen each other so little over the years, but Berton insisted on coming on this final day before Chris is leaving. Berton's son, playing outside, is scared by the sight of a horse, a species he has apparently never seen before. Chris goes outside to talk to Berton. Berton claims that Solaristics has stalled since all that is done is theorizing. Chris is not interested in speculations, only in facts; all research should either be stopped, or more extreme measures taken to advance the field of Solaristics, like bombarding the planet with high-intensity radiation. Berton disagrees, as he is concerned how immoral science could destroy the planet. When Chris says that all science is, in essence, immoral (referring to Hiroshima), and suggests that Berton may have indeed been hallucinating that day, Berton angrily leaves by car. Father berates Chris for his cold attitude towards Berton, and reminds him that Chris will probably not be back before his own father's funeral.Chris' mother (Olga Barnet) is watching a program about Solaris; the ocean is still theorized to be a thinking substance, despite lack of conclusive evidence. Although there used to be place for 85 scientists at the station, all but three still remain: astrobiologist Sartorius, cyberneticist Snaut and physiologist Gibarian. The program is interrupted by a video call from Berton's car. Berton has one thing he wants Chris to know. After the incident, he and professor Messenger visited the widow and orphaned son of the deceased scientist Fechner. Fechner's son looked exactly the same as the child that Berton saw on Solaris' surface. Chris is listening in from the next room. Berton disconnects the call, and during his long car ride through a futuristic city, he seems mesmerized and visibly haunted by memories.Back at his parents' home, Chris is burning all books and papers related to his research which he no longer needs. He will be taking some personal videos. Chris' mother is crying as he puts a picture of a young woman in the fire. He makes one final round through the house as the horse walks by.Chris makes the trip to the planet, finally arriving at the circular space station that hovers miles above the ocean surface. Once inside the landing bay, there is no one to greet him. He proceeds, to find that the station is in disarray: wires are sticking out of the walls, some of the panels seem to be short-circuiting, and there is junk everywhere. He sees the door to Dr. Snaut's quarters, but there is no response to his knocking. He looks down a hall, and sees a human figure walking away; a children's ball is rolling towards him. He then finds Snaut (Jüri Järvet) in another room, singing. Snaut seems startled at the sight of Kelvin. He tells Chris that Sartorius is in his quarters, and Gibarian is dead by suicide. Chris knows Gibarian and is skeptical, but Snaut says Gibarian was suffering from a profound depression since an unnamed mysterious disorder began. Chris insists on meeting with Sartorius, but Snaut replies that Sartorius is in his lab and is unlikely to let Chris in. He shows Chris out, urging him to pick a room and come back tomorrow; he also warns him not to lose his head if he sees other people on board, but refuses to elaborate. Just before the door closes, Chris sees another man lying in a make-shift hammock.After picking a room, Chris goes to Gibarian's quarters. There is a child's drawing titled ""human being"" on the door. Gibarian's room is a giant mess, but there is a note addressed to Kelvin taped to a video screen. Chris starts the video and sees a recording of Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan) speaking to him. Gibarian assumes that the others have already informed Chris about his death. He has a warning for Chris, but can't explain what is happening; he fears it is only the beginning, and everyone will be affected. He assures Chris he has not gone mad; as for the research, he agrees with Sartorius that they can only break this deadlock and communicate with the planet by bombarding its oceans with high-powered X-rays, before it draws Chris in too. The door of the apartment starts to open; Chris becomes anxious, getting aware of another presence, takes the recording out and goes into the hallway towards the lab. He is drawn to a window and looks outside, but there is nothing in the vast darkness of space. He proceeds to the lab and knocks on the door, trying to reason with the doctor. Sartorius (Anatoliy Solonitsyn) agrees to come out, on the condition that Chris not enter. Sartorius is as nervous as Snaut, mentioning that Gibarian may just be the first victim. He had expressed his wish to be buried on Earth, in the dirt. Sartorius mentions that Fechner died a magnificent death in his search for truth, whereas Gibarian died a coward. Chris scoffs that such courage is mere inhumanity. Suddenly, the lab door opens and a dwarf runs out; Sartorius quickly picks him up and puts him back into the lab, stating that Kelvin is overemotional and should adapt.Kelvin leaves, noting that the windows, which were dark just before, are suddenly filled with light. Through them, he can see the ocean swirling below. A young woman in a short vest (Olga Kizilova) suddenly passes him by. He follows her through the station into a refrigerated room where he finds the dead body of Gibarian on a slab. He leaves again and returns to Dr. Snaut's quarters, telling him about his unfriendly talk with Sartorius. Chris asks if there are more people on the station, and if the young woman he saw was real; Snaut seems paranoid and asks Chris if he himself is real, refusing to answer more questions. Chris assures the doctor he doesn't believe him to be insane, but Snaut retorts that insanity would actually be a blessing.Chris leaves to his quarters, barricading the door from the inside. He resumes Gibarian's video message, in which the doctor voices his suspicions that the others think he is going mad. The young woman who Chris saw aboard appears next to Gibarian, but he pushes her away. He makes a paranoid impression, expressing his fear of the other two doctors and saying he 'has to do it'. When Snaut and Sartorius are heard knocking on the door in the video, urging Gibarian to come out, Gibarian picks up a syringe. He states he has not gone mad, his conscience is simply torturing him, implying the girl has something to do with it. He finally laments that Chris did not come earlier and stops the recording. Chris lies down on the bed, keeping a gun next to him, falling asleep. When he wakes up, he finds a woman (Natalya Bondarchuk) sitting in a chair nearby. She wears a mantle which she takes off, and puts it over a chair. She walks over to him and they kiss, but Chris is confused, unable to believe what he sees and asks her how she found him. The woman seems unaware of any problem with her presence. She finds a framed picture of herself among Chris belongings, and only realizes it is her while looking in the mirror. She seems not to remember having this picture taken. She asks if he loves her, but Chris, calling her 'Hari', says she already knows that. He asks her to stay behind for a short while, but she wants to stay with him at all times, despite his objections. She says he is as nervous as Snaut, confusing Chris even further. He invites her along, but asks her to put on a suit. She asks him for help with her dress: Chris finds that the dress won't open, and there is a tear in it at the arm, with a puncture mark in Hari's skin. He uses scissors to cut the dress open. Hari notices Chris' anxiousness as he sees that his door is still barricaded from the inside.Part Two:Chris takes Hari to the landing bay, where he readies a rocket from the station for departure. He urges her to enter it first under the pretense that he has to enter last to close it. After she has entered, he quickly traps her inside and starts the lift-off sequence. Despite her screams and pleas, Chris tries to leave but finds that he is locked inside the room. He tries to take cover underneath a blanket, but sustains some burns on his suit and face from the launch. Disturbed by his own action, he returns to his room and douses himself under a shower. Snaut enters, implying that he knows Chris had company and probing him about his response to the event. He seems to know fully well what Chris did with Hari and tells him not to panic 'next time'. Chris tells him the woman had died 10 years earlier. According to Snaut, she was a manifestation of his perception of her. The manifestations started after an experiment where X-rays were applied to the surface of the ocean. Snaut says that Chris is fortunate that his manifestation is a figure from the past, because it can also be an imagined person. Apparently, the ocean has probed the scientists' minds and extracted isolated parts of memory from it; more Haris will probably appear. Chris asks why Snaut did not warn him this would happen, but Snaut replies he would not have believed him anyway. Chris admits he was scared and acted wrongly, but quickly focuses on his task of liquidating the station, asking for Snaut's support. Snaut implies that this encounter with Hari is just what Chris may have always wanted. He attaches some paper to the air vents, an idea of Gibarian to simulate the sounds of leafs, as on Earth. He urges Chris to rest and meet him in the library later, to give him some books.Chris goes to sleep and has vivid dreams. He awakens thinking Snaut has entered the room. However, it is Hari who is back. She takes a pair of scissors and opens her dress herself, and puts her mantle over the chair, seemingly not surprised by the mantle and dress already present. Chris takes her in bed and acts as if everything is normal. Sometime later, Chris takes her mantle and dress, and exits the room, leaving Hari sleeping. He closes the door, but Hari immediately starts to pound on it from the other side, pushing herself through the metal door and severely lacerating herself. Chris quickly stuffs the dress and mantle in a corner and carries Hari onto a bed. He picks up something to tend to her wounds, but to his astonishment, the wounds on her arms have already closed within seconds. She sits upright and says that she panicked when she noticed that Chris was not around. There is a call on the phone from Snaut: he asks about the situation and says that Sartorius has summoned everyone to the laboratory. Hari has also noticed that her wounds have already healed, and is deeply disturbed by it.Snaut and Sartorius see Chris approaching as he shows Hari around the station. He lets her introduce herself. Sartorius explains that, while people are made of atoms, the Visitors are made out of neutrinos. Neutrino systems are inherently unstable, so the planet must send out a magnetic field that keeps them stable. Sartorius calls Hari an 'excellent specimen', but Chris really considers her his wife. Sartorius suggests that Chris take a blood sample from his so-called 'wife' to clarify some things.Chris finds out that Hari's blood keeps regenerating itself, as if she is immortal. Sartorius implies that Chris should try an autopsy on Hari, reasoning that the Visitors are inferior to lower animals on Earth. Chris is shocked, indicating that Hari feels pain as any human being, and warning Sartorius to stay away from her. Sartorius admits that he is somewhat jealous of the emotional contact between Chris and his Visitor. Chris sarcastically comments that this makes him feel guilty, and leaves.The liquid surface of Solaris is swirling violently. Chris shows Hari a home video made by himself and his father. It shows Chris as a boy, a woman and a man in a snowy landscape around their house. The film jumps several years ahead, showing an teenage Chris and his mother in the same setting during spring. It then shows Hari in winter, wearing the same dress and mantle as the Visitor Hari. After the film is finished, Hari looks in a mirror and says she does not know herself; as soon as she closes her eyes, she cannot remember her face. She suddenly remembers that the woman in the video hated her. Chris tries to assure her that this woman already died before he met Hari, but Hari is not fooled, as she remembers vividly how the woman told her to leave the house. Chris reveals that after that event, he was transferred for his work, and Hari refused to come with him; something she also remembers.Hari sleeps, but Chris can't. Snaut knocks on the door, and while bandaging his hand, he tells Chris that the rate of regeneration has slowed down, so they will be rid of the Visitors for 2 or 3 hours. He reasons that since Solaris extracts the Visitors from the scientists' minds during sleep, they should send their waking thoughts towards the planet by X-rays, which will hopefully stop the apparitions. Although Chris does not like the experiments with X-rays, Snaut proposes modulating the beam with the brain waves of Chris. However, Chris fears that the planet may read that he wants to get rid of Hari, and it will kill her. Both men do not realize that Hari is awake and hears everything. Snaut mentions that Sartorius is working on another project, something called the 'Annihilator', which can destroy neutrino systems. Chris feels this is blackmail, to get him to cooperate with the brain wave project. In order to make up, Snaut mentions tomorrow is his birthday, and that all are invited. He notices that it is worrying that Hari already knows how to sleep. He invites Chris to come with him to Sartorius, leaving Hari to sleep. As Chris leaves, Hari seems to sob under her blanket. At the lab, Chris suddenly says he forgot something, and returns to his quarters. He grabs Hari, hugs her passionately and asks her to forgive him. They kiss as clouds roll over the liquid surface of Solaris.Hari is standing next to the bed as Chris is waking up. She is apparently confused about her origin and claims Chris does not love her. Chris does not understand, so she explains that the real Hari poisoned herself, meaning she must be someone else. She is saddened that it Sartorius who told her the night before, and not Chris himself, and she does not want to continue this way, fearing for Chris' well-being. She asks him to tell her about the real Hari. Chris explains that at the end of their relationship, they quarreled a lot, and Chris left, even though he often thought of her. Chris implies that Hari threatened with suicide, but he left anyway, until he remembered that he had left an experimental liquid in the fridge. He went back, but Hari had already injected herself with this poisonous liquid. Visitor Hari is distressed when she sees a needle mark on her arm as well. She asks Chris why real Hari did it; Chris believes that she incorrectly thought he did not love her anymore. Visitor Hari says how much she loves him; he urges her to sleep, but she says that even her sleep feels unreal.In the library, everyone is waiting for Snaut. Sartorius, who is immersed in his books, says Snaut may be delayed due to more Visitors. Snaut arrives an hour and a half late, much to Sartorius' chagrin, and once again makes a very incoherent impression. He hands Chris a book from a pile for him to read out loud, while giving Hari a kiss on her hand. It is an excerpt from Don Quixote, where Sancho praises the blessings of sleep. Sartorius proposes a toast to Snaut's courage and devotion to science. Snaut responds that science is a fraud, and claims their present scientific problem won't be solved. He says mankind has no ambition to conquer the cosmos; Man simply wants to extend Earth's borders, wanting no others worlds, but only mirrors to see his own in. Attempts at contact with extraterrestrials is doomed to fail, as the goal is one mankind fears and does not need: ""Man needs Man"", he concludes. Instead, he proposes a toast to Gibarian, who was fearful. Chris does not agree, stating that he thinks Gibarian committed suicide because he thought he was alone in what happened to him, seeing no other way out. Sartorius counters this, claiming that nature created Man to gain knowledge in search of truth; he criticizes Chris for only showing interest in lying in bed with his ex-wife all day, and Gibarian for being contemptible. Snaut quickly quells the argument. Hari is visibly disturbed by the exchange of words; she claims that Chris is the only one displaying some humanity under inhumane conditions, whereas the other two do not seem to care and regard their Visitors as external enemies. She claims the Visitors are their conscience, and Chris may indeed love her, or show a humane reaction at the very least, unlike the others, who she resents. Sartorius becomes confrontational again, questioning her right of existence, as the real Hari is dead and she is a mere reproduction or copy. Hari acknowledges this, but says she is becoming human; she can feel and love, and can exist independent from Chris. She walks away, hurt by Sartorius' cruel words, and knocks over a chandelier. She tries to take a drink, but cannot swallow it, breaking down in tears. Chris tries to comforts her, much to Sartorius' disgust, who leaves. Snaut says that all the quarreling makes them loose their humanity and dignity. In tears, Hari says that each of them is human in his own way, and thats why they quarrel. Chris thanks Snaut for his continuing kindness. Snaut is inebriated; he says he is completely worn out and starts a walk with Chris. He says that he is entitled to get drunk for all the sacrifices he has made for the mission. He likens Sartorius with Faust, as he is seeking a way against immortality. They walk through the station, Snaut singing and talking gibberish about communicating with the planet. Chris wants to return as he left Hari alone in the library. Snaut warns him that the station is shifting orbit, so there will be 30 seconds of weightlessness at 1700 hours.Chris returns to the library, finding Hari sitting and smoking, lost in thoughts. She thinks of voices as she looks intensely at a painting in the library, depicting a lively winter landscape back on Earth. She has a brief memory of Chris as a boy, standing in the snow as well. Chris awakens her from her trance. Objects as well as Chris and Hari start to float due to weightlessness. They share a short moment of happiness amidst the art in the room as the gravity comes back.The planet surface starts to make boiling movements. There is a sound of something shattering as Chris finds Hari lying dead on the floor in the main corridor, having immersed herself with liquid oxygen. When Snaut enters the corridor, Chris tells him she killed herself out of desperation. Snaut says that it will get worse as she gets more human from being around Chris. Chris intends to wait until she revives, but Snaut warns him that Hari cannot live outside the station. Chris says he has no choice, as he loves her, but Snaut tells him that what he loves is just a scientific anomaly that can be endlessly regenerated, and implies he should do something about it. As he leaves, he says he could never get used to the continuous resurrections. The shock of the revival is apparently agonizing for Hari, as she convulses and realizes to her horror that she is alive again. Chris tries to calm her down, assuring that even if her presence is a torment from the ocean, she means more to him than all science ever could; but Hari goes into hysterics, repeating that she should not exist. Snaut suddenly runs past them with a box.Clouds evaporate from the swirling ocean. Chris puts Hari on the bed, and assures her he will stay with her on the station. They embrace and Chris falls asleep. He awakens, soaked in sweat. As if in a dream-like state, he wanders through the central corridor, finding Snaut looking outside. He says that the ocean seems to be more active due to Chris encephalogram. Chris makes some incoherent philosophical remarks about life, souls and suffering, and the nature of love as something inexplicable and perhaps the reason of human existence. Apparently feverish, he stumbles on, supported by Hari and Snaut. He surmises Gibarian did not actually die out of fear, but out of shame. ""The salvation of humanity is in its shame"", he proclaims. He is put to bed and has feverish dreams of his parental home, Hari, his mother as a young woman and his dog aboard the station. He has a conversation with his young mother in her home, as if he has just returned to Earth. The painting in the station's library is hanging on a wall in the house, and there are plastic sheets covering some of the walls. Chris tells her he almost forgot her face, and says he is unhappy and alone; his mother asks why he never called them. She asks him why he is seemingly neglecting himself. She notices stains on his arm, which she washes off. The reunion causes Chris to cry. He then awakens to the sound of Snaut boiling water. Snaut gives him a letter, saying Hari is gone. Snaut reads out her letter: she is sorry for deceiving Chris, but she saw no other solution. It was her decision, and none of the others are to blame. Snaut adds that she did it for him. Chris is shocked and asked how it went. Apparently, the Annihilator caused an explosion of light, and then a breath of wind. Chris tearfully reminds himself of all his quarrels with her the past few days, and asks why they are so tormented. Snaut replies that it is because Mankind, unlike his primitive ancestors, has lost his believe in greater Cosmic powers, and draws a parallel with the myth of Sisyphus (a Greek king punished by the Gods for his treachery and cruelty by having to do a task that he could never complete). Since Chris' encephalogram was sent down to the planet, the Visitors have stopped appearing, and now, islands are appearing on the ocean's surface. Chris believes that the planet may finally understand them now.Chris and Snaut continue their philosophical talk in the library. Chris asks if Snaut feels a clear link with the life below after so many years on the station. Snaut cryptically remarks that the meaning of life and other eternal questions only interest unhappy people, and such questions should be asked at the end of one's life; Chris still sees Hari's cloak hanging on a chair, and mentions mankind is always in a hurry since they never know when their life will end. The happiest people are the ones who never ask such questions; we question life to seek meaning, yet to preserve all the simple human truths like happiness, death and love, we need mysteries. Not knowing the date of your death practically makes one immortal.As clouds roll by, Chris is immersed in thought, narrating that his mission is over. There is now the option to go back to Earth and let everything be normal again, to resume his life. But he also thinks that is no longer a reasonable option. The other possibility is to stay, even for an imaginary possibility of contact with the ocean, which his race is desperately trying to attain. And perhaps hoping for Hari to return. But he has no more hope and can only wait for a new miracle.In the station, Snaut tells Chris that he thinks it is time for Chris to return to Earth. Chris questions this opinion, smiles and looks at the box which Snaut was carrying earlier. It contains a growing plant.Once again, plants are gracefully moving through a flowing stream of water. Chris is back on his parents' land, observing the lake which is frozen. He returns to the house where his dog is running to him. The fire outside where he burnt his books is still smoking. Looking inside the house, there is water dripping inside the living room. Chris' father is sorting books; as he moves under the drops of water, smoke comes off him. The old man notices Chris and goes outside. As Chris gets on his knees and hugs his father, the camera pulls back through the swirling clouds, revealing that the house, the lake and the surrounding land are lying on a small island amidst the vast ocean on Solaris.The End"

Based on ""Sister of the Road,"" the fictionalized autobiography of radical and transient Bertha Thompson as written by physician Dr. Ben L. Reitman, 'Boxcar' Bertha Thompson, a woman labor organizer in Arkansas during the violence-filled Depression of the early '30's meets up with rabble-rousing union man 'Big' Bill Shelly and they team up to fight the corrupt railroad establishment and she is eventually sucked into a life of crime with him.—alfiehitchie In the 1930's American south, Bertha Thompson decides to live the life of a transient after her crop duster father dies in a crash leaving her alone in the world. She grows up quickly from the experiences she has with various people she meets while riding the rails. Ultimately, she ends up traveling with three others: ""Big"" Bill Shelly, a laborer who now speaks on behalf of workers' rights and unions; Rake Brown, a gambler not averse to cheating and who carries a gun but is too scared to ever use it; and Von Morton, a harmonica playing black man who worked as her father's mechanic. Despite their different motivations in life, the four become fiercely loyal to each other, especially Bertha and Bill, both who consider the other to be the love of their life. Besides Rake's need to cheat to make a living, none of the four is predisposed to criminal behavior, but they end up living a life of crime out of circumstance, which included a card game gone wrong. Bill in particular feels uncomfortable with the criminal behavior in and of itself, except for the good he can do for the working class in the crimes. Even before their overtly criminal activities, they riled the police, who harassed them for riding the rails and for Bill's ""Bolshevik"" talk. But they also rile a railway owner named Sartoris and the sadistic McIver brothers, who work as henchmen for both the authorities and Sartoris, as Bill's pro-union/pro-striking diatribes are generally against the railroad.

During the trip, a life force trapped in the frozen creature is released, killing and stealing the memories of the passengers.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 1906 Shanghai, anthropologist Professor Sir Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee) is returning home to England via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow. He brings with him a large crate containing the prize from his expedition in the mountains of Manchuria: the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature, which Saxton is sure is the missing link in the evolutionary chain. Also on board is Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), a colleague of Saxton's from the Geological Society of London.Mysterious deaths occur even before the train sets out. A known thief is found dead on the platform after having looked into the crate. His corpse is discovered bleeding from the eyes, which have turned blank and white. A slightly unbalanced, Rasputin-esque monk named Pujardov (Alberto de Mendoza) claims that the contents of the crate is evil. Pujardov is the spiritual adviser for Count Maryan Petrovski (George Rigaud) and his wife, Irina (Silvia Tortosa), and he tries to demonstrate to them that the crate is an omen of evil: in a bizarre rationalization, he claims that where there is evil, there is no place for the sign of the cross, and a piece of chalk fails to make the marking of the cross on the side of the crate. Saxton dismisses it as a trick and discredits the monk.Saxton is eager to keep his find a secret from everyone, especially Dr. Wells, but Wells pays the baggage man (Víctor Israel) to look into the crate when everyone is gone and tell him what's inside. Later, the man does this and is also killed by the creature, which possesses a glowing red eye. After gazing at the red eye, the man's eyes begin to bleed and turn white until he falls down dead. The ape-man quickly picks the lock of the crate just like the Chinese thief did back at the beginning of the train's voyage. The creature leaves the crate and places the baggage man's corpse inside instead; the others discover it later and Saxton is forced to come clean about his discovery. Inspector Mirov (Julio Peña) represents authority on the train, and he tries to keep the news of the death quiet among the passengers, while simultaneously searching for the creature.A beautiful woman insinuates herself into Dr. Wells' compartment; she is Natasha (Helga Liné), and she uses her feminine charm to convince Wells that she is a lady in distress. In reality, Natasha is a spy intent on pilfering a block of steel belonging to the Count - who knows the formula for its creation - from the train's safe. She is recognized by Yevtushenko (Ángel del Pozo), a prominent engineer who knows he has seen her before. Wells dines with the both of them in the dining car, but Mirov summons him and his assistant, Miss Jones (Alice Reinheart) to perform an autopsy on the baggage man. When they remove the top of his skull, they find that his brain is strangely smooth; Wells concludes that the brain has somehow been ""drained"" of all knowledge and memory. Later, when he sees a boiled fish with a white eye, he decides that this is the reason the eyes of the victims turn white; the memories and information are absorbed through the eyes, causing this reaction.The fossil continues to haunt the train and kills two guards, eventually overcoming Natasha when she sneaks into the baggage compartment and attempts to remove the steel block from the safe. Wells happens upon the murder scene and the fossil tries to attack him, but it is gunned down by Inspector Mirov, who stares at the creature and then collapses into unconsciousness.In a strange experiment, Saxton, Wells and Jones discover images embedded in liquid inside the eye of the fossil, images that reveal a prehistoric Earth, as well as a view of the Earth from outer space. They deduce that the real threat is a formless alien creature that was simply inhabiting the body of the fossil, and that it has now transferred itself to someone else on board the train. These fears are confirmed when Jones is found dead in the baggage compartment, attacked by the Inspector and drained of her brain, her eyes white and bleeding. The monk senses the evil presence inside of the Inspector and pledges allegiance to it, declaring it to be Satan. Yevtushenko becomes a victim, too, when the creature learns that he has studied the laws of physics and theories of space travel.When news of the murders on the train is wired to Siberian authorities, the train is stopped and an intimidating Cossack named Captain Kazan (Telly Savalas) boards with a small group of his men. Mirov is discovered to be the creature and is shot and stabbed, but not before the alien presence transfers itself to the monk. The passengers all evacuate to the caboose, while the monk murders Kazan and his men by draining them of their brains.The creature attacks the Count to absorb his knowledge about steel; using the combined knowledge of the minds it has absorbed, the creature intends to build a vehicle that will allow it to escape Earth. When it threatens the Countess, Saxton arrives and confronts it with a shotgun and a powerful light, which renders its deadly red eyes temporarily ineffective. Playing for time, the creature tempts Saxton by revealing that it is a formless energy that came to Earth millions of years ago from another galaxy, and was accidentally left behind by its own kind; it has survived by transferring itself to each form of life that has evolved over time. As such, it possesses all of the knowledge that Saxton so desperately wants - including, it claims, the knowledge to cure disease and end hunger. Saxton, however, decides that the alien is too dangerous to be left alive. Realizing that Saxton cannot be bargained with, it resurrects all of its victims as white-eyed zombies. Saxton and the Countess fight through the zombies back to the caboose, where the others are waiting. As Saxton and Wells desperately work to detach the caboose from the rest of the train, Kazan's superiors in Moscow send a telegraph to the next station ahead, ordering them to divert the train to a siding overlooking a precarious cliff. The operators follow this order, speculating that a war has broken out. Just as Saxton and Wells uncouple themselves from the rest of the train, it crashes over the cliff and explodes into a fireball as it hits the ravine below. The caboose rolls to a safe stop precariously near the edge, where the survivors watch the fire consume the train and the unearthly inhabitants within it."
"Aguirre, the Wrath of God",1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068182/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the 16th century, the ruthless and insane Don Lope de Aguirre leads a Spanish expedition in search of El Dorado. A few decades after the destruction of the Inca empire, a Spanish expedition leaves the mountains of Peru and goes down the Amazon river in search of gold and wealth. Soon, they come across great difficulties and don Lope de Aguirre, a ruthless man who cares only about riches, becomes their leader. But will his quest lead them to ""the golden city"", or to certain destruction?—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> South America, 16th Century. Spanish explorer Don Lope de Aguirre leads an expedition down the Amazon river to find the fabled city of El Dorado. Beset on all sides by unfriendly natives, the journey will turn out to be a treacherous one. An even bigger enemy to the party is themselves, as they start to turn on each other. Even more problematic is their leader, who is quite oppressive and does not appear to be entirely sane.—grantss It's 1560; the Spanish Empire's reach has come across South America. Now leading an expedition on the Amazon River, a group of Conquistadors are now looking for the legendary city of gold: El Dorado. Descending into madness in the depths of the South American jungle, the Conquistadors will soon find a fearless and unforgiving leader in Lope de Aguirre; and from him they will suffer the Wrath of God.—Johnny A band of ruthless conquistadors venture up a river in sixteenth century South America in search of fortune only to find that the journey rapidly becomes more perilous. Morale and feelings of loyalty to Spain deteriorate thus power struggles ensue amongst the soldiers.—Ben Parish <parishb@cs.man.ac.uk> Opening titles lay out the background of the story. After the conquest and plundering of the Inca Empire by Spain, natives invented the legend of El Dorado, supposedly situated in the headwaters of the Amazon. In 1560 a Spanish expedition set off from Peru. This is the story of the expedition based on the surviving diary of the monk Gaspar de Carvajal.As the film opens a narrator informs us that it is the 25th of December. The expedition has just passed the final peak of the Andes Mountains and is afforded its first glimpse at the jungle. We see hundreds descending into the Amazonian jungle- Spaniards in full armor, ladies in courtly dress, a monk, and hundreds of enslaved Indians carrying food, cannons, sedans and other supplies. The expedition reaches the bottom of the mountains. While many rest, Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) and Gonzalo Pizarro (Alejandro Repullés) stand looking at the river and discuss what faces them. Aguirre maintains that no one can conquer that river, but Pizarro believes that their journey will be easier from this point forward. Aguirre says, No, from here we are all going under. We see only the raging river for nearly a minute.Their break is not long. The group quickly begins their trek through the jungle. They begin to make their way through the jungle. On his horse, Pizarro struggles to cut through the branches with his sword; Indians struggle to carry the cannon, sedan and other goods. As they struggle in the mud the Indians are accosted by Aguirre for nearly dropping the sedan carrying one of the lady travelers. The narrator states that the Indians are useless as leaders and are dropping off like flies because of colds caused by the dramatic climate changes. The expedition stops and sets up camp near the river. Pizarro delivers a speech to the entire group. They cannot continue like this- the terrain is too difficult, rations are almost depleted, and they cannot hope of finding a populated area for a long time. As such he has changed his plan. Rafts will be built and manned by 40 men- these men will seek food, information about hostile Indians, and directions to El Dorado. They will have one week to return. If they don't return, they will be assumed dead, and the remainder of the expedition will march back the way they came. Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) will be in charge of the group. His mistress Donna Inez (Helena Rojo) will accompany him. Don Lope de Aguirre will be second in command, his daughter will accompany him. Brother Gaspar de Carvajal (Del Negro) will go to take the word of God to the pagans, and Don Fernando (Peter Berling) will represent the royal house of Spain. Pizarro says no one who wasn't selected should feel rejected.The group sets off on three rafts; each raft is rowed by Indians. The Spanish cast wary looks as they can hear only the raging river and the calls of the birds in the jungle surrounding them. One of the rafts gets stuck in an eddy on the other side of the river. As they are swept about in continuous circles, the remaining two rafts land on the other side of the river. They watch, clustered in a group, shouting and gesturing at the other group. Their advice, however, cannot be heard.Ursua and Aguirre discuss the trapped men. Ursua wants to help the men, but Aguirre disagrees. He does not want to stop to help them. Ursua maintains that he is still the one giving orders. As Ursua walks away Aguirre softly says, Is that so?Ursua walks over to Armando, one of the only men who will stay loyal to him, and instructs him to form a rescue party. He is to take as many men and supplies as he needs and cross the river to retrieve the trapped party. The newly formed rescue group ventures into the jungle to find a point where they can cross the river. The remaining men begin to set up camp, putting up coverings made from trees they've cut down; the women relax, and the horse gets water. Darkness falls and the group is gathered around a campfire. They discuss their trapped comrades. Several shots sound. One asks if they are being signaled, another mentions that perhaps it is a battle.Morning comes and the trapped men are dead. The river is calm now and several of the men, led by the monk, venture curiously into the river. The rescue party has just arrived and looks down at the raft, now full of only dead bodies. One notes that three men are missing- two Indians and a Spaniard. Armando directs the rescue party to return to the main body. Be wary of the Indians, he warns, the jungle is infested. One man in the party lags a few feet behind the others. His foot is caught in a trap and he is silently swept up into a tree. A comrade turns to look for him, and retraces his steps. Blood drops onto his helmet and the leaf in front of him. He looks up, and is terror struck. He turns to catch up with the group and runs screaming, Indians! Help, Help!At the camp Aguirre is unnoticed by Carvajal and Ursua as they walk past. They discuss the burial of the murdered men. Carvajal thinks the men must be buried according to a proper Christian burial. Ursua agrees and allows him to begin preparations for the ceremony. The men have passed. Aguirre calls over Perucho, one of his devotees, and mentions that the cannon is looking rusty. Perucho nods and walks over to the aforementioned cannon. Whispering La, la, la, la, he blows on a ashy light and looks around. Seeing no one he shifts the cannon slightly and ignites it. The raft and the men who were left on it are blown to bits.Inez sits halfway in her sedan and addresses Ursua. She reminds him that he knows who is responsible, and if he is allowed to get away with this- what's next? Ursua nods, but tells her they have bigger problems- Indians- theyre everywhere and no one wants to die like the men on the raft. Aguirre wouldn't rebel against the Spanish crown. Inez is skeptical and reminds him that they are no longer in Castile.Aguirre speaks with his daughter Flores. He found a tiny sloth and shares it with her. It is a little animal that sleeps the entire day.Two Spaniards sleep on rocks at the rivers edge. One awakens with a start to realize that the river has flooded and wakes up his comrade. The narrator begins: the river flooded fifteen feet last night. The rafts were swept away. Men begin scouting wood to build new rafts. Iron is collected to forge nails to help hold it together. Aguirre pulls a lifeless Indian from the water and drops him shortly thereafter. Guzman shakes an Indian, demanding an answer- will he run away if Guzman loosens his chains? He gets no answer from the silent slave. A man walks by. Guzman turns his attention to the passerby and accuses him of taking his pot. The black slave advises a conquistador not to use a tree for the raft. His advice is rejected- the advisee is afraid to venture further into the hostile jungle.
As this goes on, Ursua emerges. He asks one man what he is doing, but receives no answer. Another only responds with, everyone is doing it. No one will tell him who ordered them to begin building a raft. Ursua sees Aguirre but says nothing to him. The women observe the men as they work. Flores asks Inez, What does it all mean? Inez tells her to be quiet. It's her father's fault.The men are gathered around Ursua. Ursua speaks: He has decided that they will return to Pizarro. Aguirre is heard in the background, It is not my habit to retreat. Ursua continues: They must hike because the current is too strong. Another declares the plan is suicide- they'll all be killed by Indians! Ursua ignores the interjection- they will return to Pizarro, whatever the cost. Aguirre begins again, Shit on Pizarro- we can conquer without him. Perucho reminds them that this is why they built the rafts this morning. Aguirre calls Cortez to their attention. The great Spanish conquerer only became so renowned because he disregarded his orders. Ursua repeatedly orders Silence! But to no avail. He orders Aguirre put in chains, but is shot in the abdomen. Inez rushes to his side. His loyal Armando draws a sword, but he too is shot. Aguirre orders silence asking if anyone else wishes to join Ursua and Armando. Everyone stands silently. One begins to speak wondering what will happen now? Perhaps there are waterfalls downriver, questions another. What does it matter so long as they get closer to El Dorado, interjects another. Another man notices Ursuas fist is clenched. Surely Ursua will be killed, he mentions, but no one is willing to help him.An Indian plays a flute while Aguirre watches him.Armando is confined to chains in a jail constructed out of tree branches. Inez comforts Ursua.Monk Caspar de Carvajal sits on a rock at the river's edge. Inez approaches him. He is their last hope; Aguirre will kill Ursua and Armando. Carvajal can only console her a little- God is always on the side of the strong.Aguirre approaches Armando's cell. We want you on our side. We need men like you. He circles the cell, thwarting Armando's attempts to avoid his gaze. Think about it- but not too long. Aguirre gathers the men for a speech. They've rid themselves of the troublemakers, now it is time to elect a leader. The choice is clear- Don Fernando de Guzman. Guzman appears confused by the nomination. Perucho immediately set forth a formal proposal among the group to elect Guzman. Aguirre glares at each of the men until they reluctantly raise their hands and the decision is unanimous. Perucho elects Aguirre to remain second in command, the group agrees.Balthasar, one of the Indian slaves, speaks with Flores. He has survived plagues and floods, but what the Spanish have done to him is far worse. They named him Balthasar, his name was Runo Rimac. He was a prince before, and no one could look him in the eye. Now he is a slave like his people were. He feels sorry for Flores though, because there is no escape from this. The men sit and eat. Inez brings Armando some food to eat in his cell. While feeding him through the bars of his jail, Perucho hovers around them taunting them with a steady, la, la, la, la, la. Armando inquires quietly about how Ursua is doing. Inez does not reply.Aguirre rises to address the group again. Their position must be made legal. He orders Gaspar de Carvajal to read a document. Gaspar reads- The article addresses the king. Until yesterday these men considered themselves in the king's service. Fate, Gods Help, and their own work carried them down the river, but now they are 200 miles from Pizarro. Now they will share none of the fruits of their conquest with the Spanish crown. We Rebel Until Death. May our hands perish and our tongues dry up if this is not so. The house of Habsburg is overthrown and Phillip the Second is dethroned. By this declaration you are annihilated. Guzman is king of El Dorado. God Bless.Aguirre seizes the document from Carvajal. He declares that fortune smiles on the brave and spits on the coward. The reluctant King Guzman is shown his throne- merely two pieces of wood with a bit of velvet thrown over it. Scoffing, he asks if this is really to be his throne. Aguirre assures him it is as he forcibly seats him in it. Guzman sits there and begins to tear up. Aguirre inspects the jail cell. Armando has escaped, and the guard is dead.Guzman sits on a bench in the river, washed and massaged by two men. Aguirre comes up behind him and warns that so long as Ursua lives, his life will be in danger. Ursua still has sympathizers within the group. Guzman declares that so long as he is king, law will prevail. There should be a trial. Fine, hisses Aguirre. Try him. Then kill him.Gaspar de Carvajal leads the trial. Perucho testifies that Ursua will say nothing. No one can take what is clenched in his fist, to do so they would have to cut off his hand. Balthasar testifies that he and other Indians have received money from Ursua; Okello testifies that he has received money as well though he is not really sure as to why. Ursua is called on for a defense. Defiant, however, he says nothing. Inez sits next to him. She rises to speak. Back in Spain they paid their servant. Surely they should do the same here, even if they are Indians. Carvajal dismisses her calling her a confused child, no one will hold her testimony against her.Carvajal speaks. He declares that Ursua has been found guilty of treason and will be sentenced to death. Guzman, sitting behind him on a throne confirms the verdict and a confident Aguirre begins to walk away. He turns around, eyes wide and raging, as Guzman begins speaking again. Today is the anniversary of the last moor leaving Spain. He will grant Ursua clemency, but he forfeits all rights as a citizen. His portion will be divided- half for the church, half among the best soldiers. The following day the party continues down the river on their newly built raft. Ursua reclines by Inez, he still refuses to speak, and has begun to lose his vision. It's noon and the party spots a fire on the banks of the river. A village is burning. Aguirre sets up an attack. Okello, the black slave, is stripped save for a loin cloth, so he can scare the Indians. The group lands and, prodded by the Spaniards behind him, Okello reluctantly runs in front of them into the village. The men grab at fruit, and are admonished- they must conquer. King Guzman sits on the edge of a platform eating ripe fruit. As they discover a bucket with human skulls, and a mummy, they realize they are in a village where cannibals lived. Grabbing what little food they can, the disturbed group quickly returns to the raft and begins again to venture down the river.The river comes to a near standstill. Weary adventurers seek refuge under newly built thatched roofs. Inez warns Aguirre as he walks past- She knows his intent to kill Urusa, and God in heaven will punish him for it. Silence falls over the raft as they see Indians on the distant shore. One man is shot and dies. A perturbed Aguirre orders the men to shoot at anything to break the ominous silence. Noting the men are stilled unsettled, Aguirre orders an Indian slave to play the flute for them.Two Indians, a man and a woman, paddle over to the raft in a canoe. The Spaniards are wary of a trap, but pull them up onto the raft. The man explains with Balthasar as a translator that they have long awaited the foretold arrival of the white man with sticks that throw lightning.Guzman listens, but is quickly distracted and focuses only on the gold pendant he rips from the mans neck. They demand to know where the gold came from. The Indian's only answer is that gold is father downriver.
Gaspar de Carvajal steps forward to show the pair a Bible. He holds it up explaining that this is the word of God. He hands it to the man, who takes it and, confused, holds it against his ear. He tells the Spaniards that he hears nothing. Accused of blasphemy, he is killed. Carvajal comments that it is difficult to convert these heathens.Given hope the group begins to dream of the riches of El Dorado. Gold abounds, they have governorships, provinces and Okello even dreams of freedom. While tracing out a map Guzman declares that all the land to the left and to the right is the property of El Dorado. Every day they drift his kingdom grows larger.Okello fixes dinner for Guzman- fish stuffed with fruits and cooked over a fire. Upon being served, Guzman whines that he has no salt and holds out his cup as if expecting wine at a fine dinner. The men behind him however, are counting out the last grains they have. Today there are only ten grains per man. The horse is frightened and begins to thrash around kicking and stomping. Angry that his meal was disturbed, Guzman orders the horse off the raft. The men shove the horse off of the raft and ignore its attempt to get back on. The horse swims to the bank and stands on land the raft floats away. Carvajal muses with Perucho, that Guzman is a dead man. The sight of a horse could scare away armies of Indians, and the horse was meat for a week. Shortly thereafter Guzman is found dead just outside the raft's outhouse.Ursuas fate is sealed by Guzman's death. He is taken by Perucho and two others inland via canoe. Here, they find a tree barely able to hold his weight on its spindly branches, hoist him up so they can tie the rope down, and let him hang. Perucho sits on a branch below him and eats while reciting nonsense, waiting for Ursua to die.With all of its remaining members on board the raft keep moving slowly down the river. They approach a new group of Indians who, according to Balthasars translation, shout, Meat, Meat! Meat is floating by! As the Spaniards land, arrows fly. Spaniards shoot at Indians and light the village on fire. Starving men are soon distracted and begin to lick up salt from the ground. Suddenly a beautifully adorned Inez emerges and walks calmly and alone into the jungle. The attack is complete, and Perucho reports to Aguirre. They followed Inez's tracks a half mile into the jungle but saw neither her nor the Indians. The men accompanying him panicked at the silence and returned to the camp. As he reports a voice comes from the background. A man is plotting to return to Pizarro. He has counted the bends in the river and will travel by night and hide by day to avoid the Indians. Aguirre hears the traitor and comments to Perucho that the man speaking is a head taller than himself, and that should soon change. Perucho walks quietly over and slices the oblivious man's head off mid-sentence. Aguirre speaks- he is the greatest traitor, there will be no greater. The earth bows to his will. Anyone who attempts to leave will die. The group returns to the raft to continue downstream. As they float along, two more men are picked off by the arrows of Indians.Gaspar de Carvajal speaks with Aguirre about morale. They see nothing but death but never see their enemy. Perhaps even El Dorado is an illusion. Aguirre, however, will not have it. Mexico was no illusion, and if they give up then someone else will come along later and take it. Power and Fame are riches as well. Carvajal muses that Aguirre is leading them to their destruction- perhaps even doing so intentionally.Weeks later unbearable suffering is rampant among the men. Many are struck with fever and hallucinations due to hunger and illness. Okello sees a ship with sails in a tree. Carvajal dismisses this as a hallucination. Aguirre, however, is convinced that they will retrieve the ship and go to the Atlantic. Carvajal dares to defy him- the men are sick and near dying. They will not go with Aguirre. Okello is struck by an arrow, then Carvajal. They believe, however, that these are illusions and don't move. Flores walks to the edge of the raft and is struck by an arrow as she looks into the trees in front of her. Aguirre walks over and takes her in his arms. She dies quietly and motionless in Aguirres arms.Monkeys suddenly appear all over the raft and Aguirre follows them around the raft. He speaks- He will reach the Atlantic, take Trinidad from Spain, and Mexico from Cortez. They will have all of New Spain. He will marry his own daughter and found a pure dynasty. They will rule the entire continent together and endure. The film closes with Aguirre being the only person clearly alive. The camera circles him until the credits roll."

Peter Cushing returns as Van Helsing for the second time after a long hiatus. This time Dracula is brought back to life in modern London and preys on a group of young party goers that includes the descendant of his nemesis, Van Helsing.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com NOTE: Sequel to ""Scars of Dracula"" (1970).Hyde Park, London, 1872: A coach is seen on a road in the woods of Hyde Park. It is the 'final' confrontation of Professor Lawrence Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] and his arch enemy, the demon vampire Dracula [Christopher Lee], struggling on top while the frightened horses pull the driverless vehicle at high speed. The band around a leather strap securing the horses gives out, causing them to separate from the vehicle, and as Dracula hurls Van Helsing from the coach it crashes into a tree. A stranger (Christopher Neame) on horseback some distance away is catching up to the coach. An injured Van Helsing struggles to his feet. Dracula has been impaled on the exposed spoke of a wheel, but when their eyes meet he still lunges forward to continue the fight. Van Helsing pins Dracula to the ground until the makeshift stake destroys him and he turns to dust. Having completed his task, Van Helsing dies as the stranger arrives, approaches the pile of dust and gathers some in a vial, placing Draculas ring on his own finger. At the funeral for Van Helsing in the graveyard of St. Bartolph's Church, he digs a hole near the gravesite into which he pours some of the dust and uses the wheel spoke to seal it in.The time shifts to early on a Friday night in September 1972, a century later. Teenagers have crashed a party. Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) dances with her boyfriend Bob Tarrant (Philip Miller), while their friends Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame), Laura Bellows (Caroline Munro), Joe Mitchum (William Ellis), Greg Puller (Michael Kitchen), Anna Bryant (Janet Key) and Gaynor Keating (Marsha Hunt) also enjoy the music of the band (Stoneground) they came to hear. Another teen is painting a group scene on a mirror, and two others make out beneath the buffet table as the homeowners, Charles (Michael Daly)--who is the honoree--and their staid guests look on. Charles tells his mother (Lally Bowers) that he invited only the band to his party and does not know anybody else there. Joe is mildly rude to her, she urges Charles to take action, and he calls the police. The group make bets as to how long it will take the police to arrive, planning to be gone one minute before then. Johnnythe descendent of the stranger from the pastguesses eight minutes because of heavy traffic, but Joe is sure they will arrive in four minutes. The sirens come at four and a half minutes, and the teens file out. Johnny picks up a prized figurine and teases the mother by passing it hand to hand before breaking it and making his exit. The teens under the table are the only ones discovered by the cops.The group gathers at the Cavern coffee bar, where Johnny suggests they try a black mass. He has the perfect location, as St. Bartolph's Church nearby is condemned, and that evening is an insignificant date on the satanic calendar. Jessica is leery, but the others encourage her to join them. At his apartment later, Johnny looks at his inherited ring and vial with the remaining vampire dust inside. Bob uses a carwash before he drives Jessica home, assuring her that they will probably wind up partying instead of trying to raise up Beelzebub. He asks if her grandfather, as an authority on demonology, could help, but she says he is an anthropologist and dismisses the notion. He kisses her and says he will pick her up for the midnight gathering. She enters the house and finds the housekeeper Mrs. Donnelly (Constance Luttrell) is away. She goes to the home library, pulls a book about black masses and sits to read it until her grandfather Lorrimer Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) appears. He asks why she is casually reading a serious scientific work. She dismisses the concept of black magic. He asks if she wants to go out to dinner with him, but she wants to go with her group instead, and she candidly assures him before she leaves that she is only indulging in being with people her own age and has dabbled in beer, but is not into drugs or sex. Putting the book away, Lorrimer looks at an image of Dracula displayed on the wall.Late that evening, Bob pulls up at the fenced-in church and finds a loosened plank for them to enter the churchyard. He comes upon the grave of Lawrence Van Helsing. He thinks somebody has played a prank, but Jessica says it is indeed the grave of her great grandfather. Its inscription ""Requiescat in Pace Ultima"" (rest in final peace) puzzles her. She also sees that the date is exactly one hundred years to the day after his death. Joe then jumps from behind a headstone in a mask and scares Jessica. Bob is furious, but Jessica assures him she is not deterred. They enter the church to find the group decked out in shrouds Johnny has provided, and Jessica and Bob join them. Joe activates a reel tape recorder which plays a soundtrack of eerie noises and drums, while they all sit at the edges of a satanic circle on the floor and sway to the music (and to any drugs they have taken) as the aura around them takes hold. Johnny encourages them from the altar, reciting summonses to satanic entities as the tape plays out of its reel but the noises continue. Johnny mentions Dracula, and the ground around the spoke in the graveyard moves. He then calls Jessica to help him perform a baptism of blood ceremony, but she refuses. Laura excitedly volunteers. Johnny carries her to the altar and sets a chalice on her chest, pours the remaining ashes from the vial into it and slices his wrist, adding his own blood to reconstitute it. The concoction liquefies, swells and overflows the chalice. Laura screams and jumps off the altar covered in blood, but then finds she is unable to move from the circle. The others flee. Jessica wants to help Laura, but Bob pulls her to the car and they leave. Johnny proceeds to the graveyard and withdraws the spoke, a heavy mist pours out and swirls into a pillar to reshape into the revived Dracula. Johnny says he summoned Dracula, who replies it was his will as he raises his hand to show his reclaimed ring. He enters the church and bites Laura, draining her blood and claiming her as his first victim.As Bob drops Jessica at home, he rejects what they saw, saying they will all surely meet at the Cavern as usual. The group, minus Laura and Johnny, convene at the coffee bar, saying that the event could not have been real. Johnny arrives with the clothes they left behind and tells them he took Laura to the train to see her parents in Ramsgate. Gaynor says they live in Watford, but Johnny insists he is right. He uses a fake blood capsule in a water carafe to show that the ceremony was, in his words, hokum, and says Laura was in on the stunt. When the others leave, he offers Jessica a ticket to a must-see concert, but she refuses and goes away with Bob, so he invites Gaynor instead and takes her back to his place.Several young boys are playing with a ball and kick it by accident into the churchyard. They find the loose plank, enter to find the ball and come upon the mutilated body of Laura in a pile of debris. The police surgeon (Artro Morris), the detective sergeant (David Andrews) and Inspector Murray (Michael Coles) of Scotland Yard confer at the crime scene. The surgeon notes that the body was drained of blood. Jessica tells Bob she is sure Johnny is lying about where Laura went, but Bob urges her to forget it. Murray and the sergeant have identified Laura from arrest record fingerprints, and discuss the dark implications of the case. As they check her file, they see Jessica among the list of her friends. They remember that her grandfather worked with them on a blackmail case with elements of witchcraft, and decide to enlist his help again while trying to find out how Jessica might be involved. They visit Van Helsing at home and discuss vampires, the occult and supernatural phenomena when they bring up the fact that Jessica is slightly linked to the case. Outside Bob is dropping Jessica off and they see the police vehicle. Jessica tries to slip past, but Lorrimer calls her into the study to talk to the police. Though she tries to be flippant and evasive, once she learns that Laura is dead, she breaks down and admits that she and her group were at the church, details what happened, and says that the group is with Joe Mitchum. Murray tells Lorrimer she is involved but he is not sure she is implicated. Outside, he tells the sergeant to accompany him to visit Joe, where there will likely be drugs and, therefore, an opportunity to detain and talk to the others in the group. After they leave, Lorrimer finds Jessica with the phone to warn Joe about the pending police visit, and he dissuades her. He learns that Johnny Alucard, whose name was not on the police list, mysteriously insinuated himself into her group and took leadership.At his apartment, Johnny offers Gaynor a smoke and puts on a record; later they kiss and she soon falls into a stupor. He helps her into his car and drives back to the church to bring her to Dracula. In his study. Lorrimer writes the name Alucard on a piece of paper, reveals it is Dracula backwards, and concludes Johnny is a disciple. The count drains Gaynor of her blood, but he wants Johnny to bring him Jessica. Asleep in bed, Jessica tosses and frets as she has a nightmare in which she seems to witness what happens to Gaynor, and she awakens screaming. Lorrimer helps her settle back to sleep, assuring her the nightmare is over, but she replies that she doubts it. Johnny demands to be granted immortality, and Dracula reminds him that he was chosen to help destroy the Van Helsing family through Jessica. Johnny says vampirism would make it easier to find her and begs to be turned, assuring the count he will get rid of Gaynor afterward. Dracula grips Johnny by the shoulder as he turns his head for the fatal bite. Lorrimer takes out a bible, a silver knife, and a cross which he places around the neck of the sleeping Jessica. Johnny dumps the body of Gaynor out of the car to fall into the river. Later he spots a woman leaving a laundromat and he smiles, revealing fangs, and exits the vehicle.In the morning, Van Helsing goes to Sunday services at a local church and fills a vessel with holy water. Later Murray informs Van Helsing that Gaynor was found dead in Hyde Park. She was not mutilated as significantly as Laura. He also says a woman named Marjorie Baines was discovered. Lorrimer guesses correctly that her body only had two neck punctures, but Murray admits he does not know what he is dealing with. Van Helsing says Dracula had been in London before and could have returned. A phone call comes, informing Murray that the detained group members were bailed out by their parents and accompanying lawyers. Lorrimer says they might be safer in jail, but then assures Murray that he sees a pattern leading back to Johnny, and he can help crack the case, so Murray says he will officially attribute the deaths to a criminally insane killer and asks what to do next. Van Helsing recommends removing the police presence from the church so Dracula can reach his resting place, and to notify him if Johnny is located. Then he mentions possibly making use of the Cavern, but Murray says the police will be shutting the coffee bar down due to suspected drug activity.Bob goes to the Cavern and finds it closed with a police guard in front, so he sneaks in the back entrance to find Johnny, who says he has been waiting for him. Lorrimer walks to St. Bartolph's, finds the loose plank, and leaves. At the house, Mrs. Donnelly finds Bob at the door. He tells Jessica that Johnny has been arrested at the Cavern and the police want her to come join the others to add her statement. She goes with him through the back entrance of the bar to find nobody there until Johnny comes out of hiding. She sees that he is a vampire, then turns to Bob to find he is undead as well. Johnny removes her cross, burning his hand, and Bob is prepared to bite her, but Johnny says the Master wants her, and Jessica faints. When Lorrimer calls in to Mrs. Donnelly, she informs him that Jessica has gone to the Cavern. In a panic, Lorrimer runs there and finds the cross on the floor. He rushes out and nearly collides with Anna in her car. She called his home, spoke to Mrs. Donnelly and wants to help, being the only one in the group alive who has visited Johnny at his apartment. Lorrimer asks her for the address.At the apartment Johnny has a coffin in his living room and is packing a bag with candles and a folding knife when Van Helsing arrives. Johnny goads him, asking if he will give the bride, Jessica, away, and they struggle as the sun begins to rise. Van Helsing wraps the cross around the bible and tosses it into the coffin. Johnny retrieves the knife and slashes Lorrimer in the arm, but a shaft of sunlight reflected in a mirror hits him and he shrinks back, so Lorrimer uses the mirror to repel Johnny. Backing upstairs into his bathroom, Johnny accidentally releases the skylight window shade, flooding the room with sunlight. He falls into the bathtub and grabs the faucet lever, turning it on, and the running water paralyses him. Lorrimer tries to get him to talk, but as Johnny succumbs he says Lorrimer will never find Jessica. Murray and the sergeant arrive. Lorrimer says Dracula has Jessica and asks for one hour at the church as the sun sets with no police, and Murray agrees. The sergeant recommends Lorrimer visit the hospital for his bleeding arm, and Murray says they will follow other leads and visit the church later.A weak and bandaged Lorrimer returns to St. Bartolph's to find Bob has been destroyed by sunlight in the churchyard. Jessica is on the altar inside the church. She is in a trance and will not awaken until Dracula summons her. Lorrimer whispers to her and returns the cross to her neck, hiding it in her bodice, promising he will not be away for long. In the churchyard he digs an immense hole and fills it with handmade upright stakes resembling crosses, covering the trap with grasses. At dusk, Dracula appears and awakens Jessica. When she sits up, the cross appears, and the count cautiously removes it, causing his hand to smolder. Before he can bite Jessica, Van Helsing appears, urging him to remember the past encounter. Recognizing his enemy, Dracula challenges Van Helsing, pursues him upstairs and corners him, but Lorrimer produces the silver knife and stabs him in the heart. The count tumbles over the ledge to the floor below and hypnotically summons Jessica to his side for help. Though Lorrimer yells to Jessica to stop, by the time he reaches the ground floor she has removed the knife and the chase resumes. Lorrimer runs outside, stumbling at the trap, and some of the covering gives way. As Dracula reaches its edge and spots the trap, Lorrimer produces the vial of holy water and, with a quick blessing, flings the water at him, which burns the vampire like acid. Dracula loses his balance, slips on the ledge and falls, landing full body onto the stakes. He lunges back at Van Helsing but is pinned prone and helpless. Lorrimer picks up the shovel and pushes down on the vampire. The stakes impale him through the back and seal his doom as Jessica screams under his fading thrall. Lorrimer watches as the body disintegrates into dust, and Jessica rushes into his arms in time to witness the phenomenon. Lorrimer puts his coat around her shoulders, she sees Bob lying dead nearby and nearly collapses, but Van Helsing assures her gently, ""Requiescat in pace ultima,"" as she sobs in his comforting arms and they turn for home.

In the backward village of Accendura, the boy Bruno Lo Casio goes missing and the police inspector and the local commissioner and the village Captain Modesti investigate the case. When his father receives the request of a ransom, the police arrest the local Giuseppe and realize that he is innocent. Then the boys Michele and Tonino are also murdered and the police suspect of the local witch Maciara, who practices black magic, might be the killer but they find she is also innocent. However the superstitious and ignorant locals brutally kill her. Meanwhile that village is crowded of journalist, including the experienced Andrea Martelli (Tomas Milian) from Rome. He befriends Patrizi, a daughter of a wealthy entrepreneur that is living in the village after a drug scandal. They meet the village priest Don Alberto Avallone, who has a group of boys that plays soccer at the church and is the son of the weird Dona Aurelia Avallone that raises her slow six year-old daughter. They believe the child has witnessed the murders and might know who the killer is.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Overcome with dread, the God-fearing townsfolk of the sleepy Italian village of Accendura are completely helpless before the invisible deranged killer who has been murdering their innocent children. As reporters--including the inquisitive, Andrea Martelli--flock into the superstitious community to cover the shocking story, yet another young boy goes missing. To ferret out the elusive psychopath, Martelli teams up with the seductive newcomer from Milan, Patrizia, and before long, there is the first arrest among a series of prime suspects. Can the amateur detectives and the police unearth the murderer before it's too late?—Nick Riganas In the small Southern Italian village of Accendura, three local boys, Bruno, Michele, and Tonino are engaged in mischief and other activities. Guiseppe Barra (Vito Passeri) a local simpleton and peeping tom, who is seen spying on two rowdy swinging couples, is surprised when which the three boys appear behind him and yell out, ""Giuseppe's a big baby!"" which goads him into a state of bitter resentment.Meanwhile, in the hills surrounding the village, a reclusive Gypsy witch named La Magiara (Florinda Bolkan), is conducting sinister black magic ceremonies, first by digging up the skeletal remains of an infant, and then plunging pins through the heads of three tiny clay dolls. It makes it clear that these are the three youths taunting Giuseppe.When Michele returns home, his housekeeper mother urges him to deliver some orange juice to their employer, Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) a young woman from Milan who is laying low in the village after a drug scandal. It becomes apparent that Patrizia offers undefined sexual favors to the local adolescents when she's shown sexually taunting Michele.When Bruno Lo Casio goes missing, a media circus begins as reporters from all over Italy converge on the town. One of them is Andrea Martelli (Tomas Milian) a sharp-witted journalist from Rome whose insights into the case are acknowledged by the regional police commissioner (Virginio Gazzolo) working with the collaboration of the village chief of police Captain Modesti (Ugo D'Alessio). Amid local hysteria, Giuseppe is soon arrested when he's found near the dead body of Bruno. But he protests his innocence for he claims to have only discovered the body of the boy and then phoned the parents in a feeble attempt to extract a pitiful ransom of six million lira. When another dead body of a young boy, that of Tonino is found, the police realize that he really is innocent.A few nights later, during a raging thunderstorm, Michele Spriano, sneaks out of his house to meet with someone he speaks to over the phone, and he too is strangled by an unseen assailant and his body is found the following morning.Martelli soon meets and befriends Patrizia whom he recognizes from newspapers where he used to work in Milan. Patrizia is considered a slut by rest of the insular villagers mainly because of her modern style of dress with halter-tops and mini-skirts. Martelli also meets with the amiable young village priest, Don Alberto Avallone (Marc Poreli) and his strangely reserved mother Aurelia (Irene Papas). Don Alberto runs a boys group at the church (which the murder victims came from) and he also encourages the boys to play soccer on the church grounds to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. Since he is the priest and connected with the powerful Catholic Church (which holds the real power in Italy), he is well known and respected by everyone in the village and surrounding area. But Aurelia is a dour mysterious woman. A villager confides in Martelli that, ""she is only tolerated because she is the priest's mother.""Elsewhere, Captain Modesti and his aide meet with Francesco (George Wilson), an eccentric old hermit living in a tumbledown stone hut in the hills overlooking the town, who practices black magic and offers charms and potions to the superstitious. He claims to the police that he has passed his knowledge of black magic to his disciple, Magiara, and also shares time with the causal thrill-seeking Patrizia. He is also rumored to have had (and then disposed of) a baby from a tryst with Magiara.Angered by Francesco's unwillingness to co-operate with the investigation, the police proceed to hunt down and arrest Magiara. Under interrogation, the fevered woman gleefully confesses to the murders. However, it transpires to Modesti and the Commissioner that she believes her voodoo dolls and incantations have merely brought about the deaths of the three interfering boys, and she profess to have no interest or awareness of the physical methods used. An alibi provided by a policeman sighting Magiara miles away from the latest murder scene clinchers her legal innocence and she is released the following day.Nonetheless, the hostile and superstitious villagers are not convinced and the so-called ""witch"" is set upon in a local graveyard by a small mob of men who savagely beat her with heavy chains and then leave her for dead. The bloodied and mortally wounded Magiara drags herself quite a distance to the nearby expressway where she futilely tries to flag down a car, and then dies on the shoulder of the road. The following day, another young boy is found murdered, drowned in a local stream, which further increases police frustration to the case. However, the unsophisticated and religious townspeople are beside themselves with silent fear... continuing to believe that ""the witch"" is responsible for the killings and she is doing so from beyond the grave with a curse over the whole town.Patrizia herself briefly becomes a suspect when Martelli finds her gold-plated cigarette lighter at the scene of the latest killing and while being interrogated by the police, she refuses to supply an alibi for those nights of each killing. But under the threat of incarnation, she's forced to admit that she traveled outside Accendura to buy marijuana for herself. With little to hold her on, the police let her go as well.Martelli and Patrizia become more determined to track down the killer on their own. During further meetings with Don Alberto, Martelli also learns that Don Alberto's mother has another young child, a six-year-old girl born mentally retarded. Martelli becomes convinced that the little girl is a witness to the killings after seeing that she compulsively pulls the heads off her dolls, as if doing an imitation to the strangulation's. One doll's head, that of Donald Duck, is found near the latest crime scene, which this leap of reason proves accurate. But Martelli and Patrizia wonder: is the killer the priest or his mother?When Aurelia disappears with her daughter, Martelli and Patrizia track her down to a remote shack on a hill overlooking the town and when they arrive, Aurelia is found barely conscious begging them to help her stop her crazy son. It is Don Alberto who is the killer. It turns out that he straggled those young boys not for their sins, but to PREVENT them from committing sin when they grow up, as well as save them from the ""horrors of sexuality"", thus (in his mind) sending them to heaven with clean souls.In an act contrary to even his sick rationale, he attempts to throw his little sister, a witness to the crimes, off a remote cliff. Martelli arrives in the nick of time, and after a long and climatic fistfight between Martelli and Don Alberto, the twisted priest looses his balance and falls of the cliff to his gruesome death."

Frustrated at her current situation, Joan seeks solace in witchcraft after visiting Marion Hamilton, a local tarot reader and leader of a secret black arts wicca sect, who inspires Joan to follow her own path.

With images of subjugation and assault haunting her dreams, she searches for new methods of empowerment and begins to experiment with witchcraft.—Molly Rose Steed During a long and vivid nightmare, thirty-nine-year-old Joan Mitchell (Jan White) is tormented by her fear of aging and the neglectfulness of her work-obsessed husband, Jack (Bill Thunhurst). In her dream, a real estate agent tries to sell her on the amenities of her large home and affluent lifestyle. Introducing her to a virile, young man he calls Billy, the agent urges her to try him. When Joan awakens, Jack, who is preparing to leave on a business trip, kisses the air near her cheek and tells, her to have a good day. Later, while discussing the dream with her condescending psychologist, Dr. Miller (Neil Fisher), Joan is told that she has only herself to blame for her feelings of imprisonment. Joan is shown food shopping at a local market, dropping off her husband's suit at a local dry cleaners, getting her car washed at a local car wash, as well as cleaning house.At a cocktail party, Joan's confidante, Shirley Randolph (Ann Muffley), relates to Joan and several of their female friends that she has met a woman who is a witch. Before falling asleep that night, Jack, who has no sense of Joan's anguish, boasts that they are doing well. As it begins to storm, Joan drifts into a nightmare in which she sees hands rising from the side of the bed and awakens to find Jack seated on the floor doing sit-ups.The next morning, Joan's nineteen-year-old daughter Nikki (Joedda McClain) surprises Joan by remarking that she looks good and has a great body. Later, the usually repressed Joan enjoys lying naked in bed as well as looking at her nude body in the bathroom mirror.That evening, Joan picks up Shirley where the Catholic-reared Joan confesses that she feels guilty for fantasizing about having an affair. They drive to a local house where Shirley introduces Joan to Marion Hamilton (Virginia Greenwald), a second-generation witch who otherwise lives a lifestyle much like theirs. Although she is too frightened to have her tarot cards read, Joan peruses a book about witchcraft while Marion reads Shirley's cards, and she listens thoughtfully as Marion discusses how former secrets of the craft are now available in books. Afterward, while driving back home, Joan admits to Shirley that she is intrigued by witchcraft, but believes that treating it like another fad undermines what it has to offer.Joan and Shirley return to the Mitchell house, where Nikki is entertaining Gregg Williamson (Raymond Laine), a friend from college whom Joan recognizes as Billy in her dream. When Gregg claims he recognizes Joan, they soon establish that they had participated in the same volunteer community clean-up project. After Joan offers everyone drinks, Shirley, troubled by marital problems, gets inebriated and blurts out that Joan wants to be a witch. A discussion ensues, during which Gregg, an arrogant student teacher of sociology, claims that the occult seems real to people who are manipulated by the power of suggestion. To prove his point to Joan, he alters a cigarette to look like a hand-rolled joint of marijuana and offers it to the unwitting, but curious Shirley, who soon believes she is high. At Gregg's cruel prodding, Shirley hysterically voices her anxieties about getting older. Joan and Nikki silence Gregg, who offers an apology, but noting his insincerity, Joan tells him to leave. Before heading for the door, Gregg further angers Joan by saying that she is interested in him sexually. Nikki apologizes to Joan and admits that her relationship with Gregg is not serious. Afraid to face her husband alone in her present state, Shirley asks Joan to spend the night at her house.After informing Nikki of her plans, Joan drives Shirley home, but during the drive, Shirley angrily accuses her of forming opinions about experiences she has never had. Offended, Joan leaves Shirley at her door and returns home. Sensing that Gregg and Nikki are there having sex, Joan slips discreetly into her own room, where she buries her head under a pillow to block the sounds of a storm and their exuberant copulation, and struggles with her own sexual urges. Realizing that Joan has returned home, Nikki enters her room and accuses her of violating her privacy.In the morning, Joan discovers that Nikki has run away. During a therapy session, Miller brushes aside Joan's anxieties about Nikki's welfare, but enthusiastically pronounces a breakthrough when Joan cries about her personal worries. When Jack learns about Nikki's departure, he is more concerned that she might get pregnant and slaps Joan several times for not interrupting their daughter's tryst. Two policemen investigating Nikki's disappearance question the Mitchells about their acquaintances, but Joan is careful not to implicate Gregg.When Jack goes away on a two-week business trip, Joan temporarily dismisses the housekeeper so that she can be alone. After getting dressed up, Joan visits Gregg at the university to ask him where Nikki is staying. Claiming not to know, Gregg states that just because they had sex does not mean they are having a relationship. Again, he accuses Joan of desiring him and adds that he is available.Some time later, after Jack has returned from his business trip, Joan dreams that someone is trying to break the chain on the door. She grabs a kitchen knife, but a grotesquely masked man (Bill Hinzeman) knocks it from her hands and chases her. In her bedroom, as he rapes her, she pulls off his mask, but then wakens to learn that she has disturbed Jack's sleep.During Jack's next business trip, Joan creates an altar on her living room coffee table and begins to experiment with spell-casting, which she has learned from a book that she purchases during an excursion to Antic Row in downtown Pittsburgh which is titled 'How to Become a Witch; A Primer'. After performing a conjuration, Joan waits for something to happen, but when nothing does, she calls and invites Gregg to come over to have sex. Soon after, Joan asks to join Marion's coven, saying that she believes in the power of witchcraft, as she has already ""made things happen."" Marion agrees to consider her request, but warns her not to abuse the power.Joan then has another nightmare, similar to the last, in which a masked man again breaks the chain on the door and chases her through the house, but she is awakened by a call from the police, who have found Nikki. Slightly drunk, Joan is feeling vulnerable when she again invites Gregg over for sex. When she tells him she is a witch, he calls her a hypocrite. Insisting that the only thing they are doing is balling, he initiates rough sex. Afterward, as he lies naked, she begins a ritual in which she summons the spirit Virago, which enters the house through a utility room window as a cat. As it approaches the living room unnoticed, Gregg grabs Joan for an even wilder session of sex. After they are finished, Joan says that this was their last time, as Nikki will be returning in a few days after she was told by the police over the phone that Nikki is in Buffalo and will be returning.During the night, in another dream, Joan goes about her chores, happily awaiting the return of Nikki. She is pleased when she hears a car approaching, but is struck with terror when she realizes that the masked man is trying to break in. She runs to the basement, where she finds her husband's rifle and bullets. Jack, returning late in the night from his business trip, finds the door to the house chained. Cursing, he tries to force it open, and Joan shoots him dead. Although suspicious, the investigating policemen note that Jack was not expected to return from his trip until the next day and that Joan can convincingly claim that she thought he was an intruder. For lack of evidence to support murder, they report his killing as accidental.Later, Joan undergoes a ceremonial initiation into Marion's coven, which culminates in a ritual flagellation. Months later, while attending a party of her housewife friends, the widowed Joan is asked by an amazed acquaintance why she seems so different. Joan states simply, ""I'm a witch."""
Vampire Circus,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067924/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As the plague sweeps the countryside, a quarantined village is visited by a mysterious traveling circus. Soon, young children begin to disappear, and the locals suspect the circus troupe might be hiding a horrifying secret. A village in 19th-century Europe is at first relieved when a circus breaks through the quarantine to take the locals' minds off the plague. But their troubles are only beginning as children begin to disappear and the legacy of a long-ago massacre is brought to light.—David Carroll <davidc@atom.ansto.gov.au> Count Mitterhaus [Robert Tayman] was a vampire, preying on the children of the town of Stetl. With the death of one more child, the people became sufficiently enraged that they stormed the Count's castle and drove a stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus vowed, ""Your children will die to give me back my life."" Seven villagers went in, four came out -- Professor Albert Mueller (whose wife Anna had become the Count's willing consort), the Burgermeister, Dr Kersh, and Herr Hauser. Just as the castle is consumed in flames, the Count whispers to Anna, ""Tell Emil. He will know what to do.""Fifteen years later: The town of Stetl is dying, literally. A plague is slowly killing the people, although some believe it is the Count's curse at work. At any rate, neighboring villages, afraid that the plague/curse may spread, have placed roadblocks around Stetl, and they vow to shoot anyone attempting to leave or enter the town. Dr Kersh [Richard Owens] is among those who believes it to be a disease not a curse, and he plans to sneak out of the town and bring back knowledge and medicines from the city. With his son Anton [John Moulder-Brown] acting as a decoy, Dr Kersh manages to get away. Before his father leaves, Anton reminds him to find his girlfriend Dora Mueller [Lynne Frederick], the daughter of Professor Mueller [Laurence Payne] and tell her not to come back. Unbeknown to them, Dora is already planning to sneak through the roadblocks in an attempt to get back to her father and to Anton.Somehow, the Circus of Night manages to make it through the roadblocks. Tricks, performances, dancers, aerialists, wild animals -- the people of Stetl are, at least, to be entertained in their misery. But this is no ordinary circus. Serena [Serena], for example, dances totally nude, except for the tiger stripes on her body, aerialist twins Helga [Lalla Ward] and Heinrich [Robin Sachs] turn into owls as they soar through the air, and when the panther jumps up, he comes down in the body of Emil [Anthony Corlan], who seems smitten with the Burgermeister's daughter Rosa [Christina Paul], and she with him. Emil is a vampire, really Count Mitterhaus's cousin. The ring mistress, known simply as the Gypsy woman, is really Anna Mueller [Domini Blythe], and the twins are her children with the Count. Their purpose in Stetl is not to entertain, but to kill.First to suffer the consequences is the Burgermeister [Thorley Walters] when he is invited to make a special trip through the ""Mirror of Life."" At first, he is overcome with laughter at the silly distortions in the various mirrors. In the last mirror, however, he sees himself being bitten by the Count, who speaks to him, reminding him of his curse. Schilt [John Bown] and his family are among those who believe that the Count's curse is coming true. Schilt bribes Michael [Skip Martin], the circus dwarf, to lead him, his wife, and his mother out of town. Michael is happy to comply but leaves them stranded just beyond the roadblocks, where they are torn up by the panther. Next to be invited through the Mirror of Life are the Hausers, Jon [Roderick Shaw] and Gustav [Barnaby Shaw]. In the final mirror, they see the twins, Heinrich and Helga, who take them through. The next morning, their bodies are found lying on the ground, drained of blood, with holes in their necks. The Burgermeister, afraid that his daughter will be next, orders that all the circus animals be killed. Herr Hauser [Robin Hunter] shoots the monkey and the tiger, but just as the Burgermeister is about to shoot the panther, he has a heart attack, and Emil disappears. Next is Rosa's turn. Emil leads her to the crypt where the Count's body is being kept. There, Emil bites Rosa and allows her blood to spill on the Count. Emil vows that tonight Professor Mueller's daughter Dora will die, and the Count will live. During the next circus performance, Dora is invited through the Mirror of Life. Anton follows, just in time to see her go through the mirror. Heinrich prepares to bite her neck but is thwarted by the cross around it, and she is cast out of the mirror.Dr Kersh returns to Stetl with the information that the plague is actually a virulent strain of rabies caused by bats. He brings medicines, but he also brings the news that there are vampires in the land and that, in each case where people have been reported killed by vampires, the Circus of Night has stayed for a day or two. It appears that Stetl must rid itself of two plagues, not just one.Following her brush with the vampires, Dora has locked herself in the living quarters of the school where her father teaches. But that doesn't thwart the vampires. Emil gets through an open window on the second floor, changes himself into the panther, and attacks the students, killing every last one. Meanwhile, Heinrich, Helga, and the Gypsy find Dora. The Gypsy removes the cross from Dora's neck, and Heinrich and Helga draw in for the kill. Dora runs to the school chapel where she knocks over a cross that impales Helga and, by twin empathy, the gaping hole also appears in Heinrich's chest. Emil and the Gypsy escape, but the Strongman [David Prowse] breaks into Dora's house and takes her and Gerta Hauser [Elizabeth Seal] to the crypt. Hauser, Mueller, Dr Kersh, and Anton form a brigade of vampire hunters and they storm the circus, killing the Strongman. Hauser sets the Mirrors of Life on fire, but he becomes trapped in the flames and burns to death. The vampire hunters figure that the Count is probably in the crypt, so they head there.Meanwhile, Emil has just finished feasting on Gerta Hauser and turns his attentions to Dora. As he leans forward for the bite, the Gypsy (who has been holding Dora) aka Anna suddenly pushes her daughter to the side, and Emil bites Anna instead. Anton attempts to chase off Emil with a crucifix, but a bat knocks it out of his hand. Suddenly, the other vampire hunters break into the crypt and tussle with Emil. Emil kills off a number of them, but Mueller manages to pull the stake out of the Count's body and uses it to stake Emil. With the stake removed from his chest, the Count wakes up. He goes after Dora, but Anton beheads him with a crossbow. Only Dora, Anton, and Dr Kersh manage to survive the carnage. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"
Asylum,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068230/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In order to secure a job at a mental institution, a young psychiatrist must interview four patients inside the asylum. A young psychiatrist interviews four inmates in a mental asylum to satisfy a requirement for employment. He hears stories about 1) the revenge of a murdered wife, 2) a tailor who makes a suit with some highly unusual qualities, 3) a woman who questions her sanity when it appears that her brother is conspiring against her, and 4) a man who builds tiny toy robots with lifelike human heads.—Wes Clark <wclark@uspto.gov> The young psychiatrist Dr. Martin comes to an isolated mental institution for a job interview with Dr. B. Starr; however his associated Dr. Lionel Rutherford tells that the chief doctor had a mental breakdown and now is an inmate. Dr. Rutherford proposes Martin to interview four inmates to find who Dr. Starr is; if he succeeds, he would have the position. He goes upstairs and is received by the nurse Max Reynolds. 1st Interview: Bonnie (""Frozen Fear""): The inmate Bonnie tells that her lover Walter and she have plotted to kill his wealthy wife Ruth, who studies voodoo with a powerful priest, and hide her body in a freezer. Walter dismembers her body and wraps the pieces; however Walter and Bonnie have a dreadful surprise. 2nd Interview: Bruno (""The Weird Tailor""): The tailor Bruno is completely broken and needs money to pay the rent to his landlord Stebbins; otherwise, his wife Anna and he will be evicted. He accepts a weird request from the mysterious Mr. Smith to make a suit for his son. But when the suit is ready, Mr. Smith tells that he has no money to pay for his work and there is a tragic consequence. 3rd Interview: Barbara (""Lucy Comes to Stay""): Barbara is released from an asylum under the custody of her brother George and he brings her home to be nursed by the nurse Miss Higgins. Out of the blue, her best friend Lucy visits her and invites Barbara to flee with her. What will Barbara and Lucy do? 4th Interview: Byron (""Mannikins of Horror""): Dr. Byron explains that he has built organic toys to transfer soul to it. Who might be Dr. Starr?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The young Dr. Martin goes to a job interview at a psychiatric hospital. Thinking he would meet Dr. Star, he instead meets with his assistant Dr. Rutherford. Dr. Martin is confused until he finds out that Dr. Star can not interview him because he has just gone insane! Dr. Star is now a patient instead of the director.
Dr. Rutherford wants Dr. Martin to interview several patients as a test of his competence for the position. Rutherford is behaving oddly but Dr. Martin complies with the test. The first patient is Bonnie and her tale in this anthology is called ""Frozen Fear"". Bonnie is having an affair with a married man named Walter. His wife, Ruth is aware but is not letting him go. So, Walter takes her to the basement and kills her with his ax and freezes her as he wishes her to rest in pieces. Then he calls Bonnie to tell her that the deed is done. They are going to take a plane and then they decide to take Ruth's frozen pieces along to dispose of them. Oh but there is a problem. Ruth's pieces escape and she gets her revenge by choking Walter to death and her head and other parts send Bonnie over the edge and into the Asylum in a very creepy sequence. Of course Ruth made sure that Bonnie was framed and left scarred forever.
The next patient is named Bruno and his tale is the ""Weird Tailor"" and he tells it to Dr. Martin as he is sewing a garment. Bruno is in danger of being evicted and losing his tailoring business. As his and his wife's fear and stress mount, a stranger (Peter Cushing) arrives, offering a large sum for an unusual job. Bruno works on the suit of strange material, and then delivers it at midnight as instructed to. He travels to the large mansion to find that his customer is broke so they must wait for his son to return for the tailor to be paid. Then Bruno learns that the stranger's son is a corpse and the two begin to fight. Peter Cushing drew a gun and of course was killed, like he is in all of his movies. Bruno returned home after taking a rare book as payment. Bruno's wife puts the suit on a mannequin. When the couple fights over the murder of the stranger, the mannequin comes to life and settles the score. Next the Dr. visits with Barbara and she tells her story, "" Lucy comes to stay"". Barbara's brother George, and his assistant Miss Higgins bring her home from the mental hospital and are quite controlling. Then Miss Higgins' mother becomes ill so she leaves for the hospital with George offering to give her a lift to the station. Barbara stays home and that is when Lucy appears. The beautiful Lucy greets Barbara and shares her plan. Lucy is adventurous and mischievous and proves that as she cuts the phone lines and manipulates Barbara. Much to Barbara's shocking dismay, Lucy did not just use the shears to cut the lines, but she buried them into George's chest. And Miss Higgins who has just returned, is next. Who was Lucy? Was she a ghost, a villain, or a second personality? You must watch to unravel this one.
The last patient is a man that calls himself Byron. He tells the tale of ""Mannikins of Horror"".
Byron claims to be a Dr. and tells Martin that Rutherford is a liar. Dr. Martin has seen enough and is disgusted with how the hospital is run and how no attempts to bring the patients back are made. As Martin lectures Rutherford, Byron and Dr. Star, unleash a surprising but deadly force to destroy Rutherford. Which Dr. or Drs. meet their doom? The answer is hidden in the absolutely chilling and outstanding conclusion brought to you by Dr. Star! Of course, now Star is ready for his next interviewee."
Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068555/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Seven stories are trying to answer the question: what is sex? Or maybe they are not trying. Seven segments related to one another only in that they all purport to be based on sections of the book by David Reuben. The segments range from ""Do Aphrodisiacs Work?"" in which a court jester gives an aphrodisiac to the Queen and is, in the end, beheaded to ""What Happens During Ejaculation?"" in which we watch ""control central"" during a successful seduction.—Scott R. Vaughn <scott@vaughn.hon.msu.edu> Seven unrelated stories are presented, they only tied together in that each loosely tries to answer a question about sex. In ""Do Aphrodisiacs Work?"", a court fool in medieval England is in lust with the Queen. He believes the only chance he has with her, regardless of the consequences by the King if he is caught (the King who already believes the fool not to be funny), is to ply the Queen with an aphrodisiac obtained from a sorcerer. Even if the aphrodisiac works, the fool may have more challenges in having the Queen. In ""What Is Sodomy?"", married Dr. Doug Ross, who has a general practice in New York City, receives a visit from a new patient, Stavros Milos, a rural Armenian recently arrived in the US and the brother of an existing patient. The reason for Mr. Milos' visit leads to Dr. Ross questioning his own sex and love life, as well as his sanity. In ""Why Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching an Orgasm?"", mod Italian couple Fabrizio and Gina have a passionate yet detached relationship, typical of what one might see in aFederico Fellinimovie. The problem is that he cannot bring Gina to orgasm. In asking his friends and acquaintances how to overcome the problem, Fabrizio may come across the answer in the most inopportune of ways. In ""Are Transvestites Homosexuals?"", middle aged Sam, who has long been married to Tess, has been feeling out of sorts of late. At a small dinner party hosted by their daughter's in-laws, Sam takes measures to make himself feel better, being caught in his self-pleasurement which would lead to some tough questions by all. In ""What Are Sex Perverts?"", celebrity panelists on the game show ""What's My Perversion?"" ask questions of the guest to figure out what his sex perversion is. This particular episode also contains a weekly feature, where a pervert of the week gets to act out his/her fantasy on the air. In ""Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research and Experiments Accurate?"", Dr. Bernardo, who formerly worked for Masters and Johnson, is doing his own sexual studies now. Victor Shakapopoulos, a researcher who will be working with Dr. Bernardo, and Helen Lacey, a journalist who will be interviewing Dr. Bernardo for a news article, meet en route to Dr. Bernardo's house cum laboratory. Victor and Helen will find that their encounter with Dr. Bernardo is nothing as they imagined, and has potentially deadly consequences. And in ""What Happens During Ejaculation?"", mission control in Sidney's brain believes, based on everything that has happened on his current date, that he will have sex tonight. After a dry spell, mission control may have problem coordinating all Sidney's bodily functions, while his sperm, anxious for a release, may not know how to proceed due to lack of practical knowledge.—Huggo The credits at the start and close of the film are played over a backdrop of a large mass of white rabbits, to the tune of ""Let's Misbehave"" by Cole Porter.The film is divided into seven vignettes, as follows:""Do Aphrodisiacs Work?""In Elizabethan times, the king (Anthony Quayle) is infuriated by his fool (Woody Allen), whom he considers unfunny. Later, the fool follows the queen (Lynn Redgrave) into the gardens and fondles her. After she stalks away, the ghost of the fool's father appears and commands him to have sex with the queen. A sorcerer provides him with an aphrodisiac but warns him that if the king discovers the potion, he will be killed. The fool then gives the queen the potion, and as soon as she drinks it, she demands that he ravage her. Upon removing her clothes, however, the fool discovers her chastity belt, and gathers keys and tools in a desperate attempt to break it open. As the fool opens the belt, the noises from inside the room attract the attention of the guards and the king himself. Hearing him approach, the fool and the queen struggle to close the belt, but his hand becomes stuck inside, so she throws her dress over his hand to hide it. When the king wants to make love to his wife, the fool pretends to leave but hides beneath her skirt. Soon, the king uncovers the fool and has him beheaded.""What Is Sodomy?""At Dr. Ross's (Gene Wilder) busy practice, he is surprised by a visit from Armenian shepherd Milos Stavros (Titos Vandis), who announces that he is in love with a sheep named Daisy. Unsure how to respond, Ross is further horrified to hear that Milos made love to the animal but now imagines that she is cold and indifferent to him. When Milos urges the doctor to speak to her for him, Ross gently suggests psychiatric care. Milos insists on carrying Daisy inside, where, as Ross explains why Milos' feelings are completely inappropriate, the doctor strokes the sheep and begins to fall in love with her.That night at dinner Ross is listless and later, his wife Anne (Elaine Giftos) finds him petting his lambswool sweater. The next day, Milos brings Daisy to the office, and Ross nervously woos her. He takes her to a hotel room, ordering caviar and grass from room service. Soon he is buying the animal diamonds and lingerie, but when Anne catches the two together, Ross loses his family and his license. Waiting tables to support Daisy, he screams to the crowd that he is a doctor, then returns home to find a note from Milos stating that he has taken Daisy back to Armenia. A broken man, Ross drinks Woolite on street corner.'Why Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching an Orgasm?""(Note: this segment is filmed entirely in Italian)After his wedding, Fabrizio (Woody Allen) takes his bride Gina (Louise Lasser) to bed, but she is unmoved and passive. Over the next weeks, he grows despondent at his wife's lack of passion, and disheartened by his friends' tales of their sex lives. Despite his exhaustive efforts, she remains bored. Fabrizio visits his priest, who states he can do nothing to help. One day the couple is in a store when Gina becomes aroused and urges Fabrizio to make love to her. Realizing that she wants to make love only in public places, the two enjoy sex in church, restaurants and friends' homes. Although Fabrizio is concerned that they will one day be discovered, he is relieved that at least his wife is not frigid.""Are Transvestites Homosexuals?""Sam (Lou Jacobi) and Tess have dinner with the parents of their daughter's fiance Alvin. During the meal, Sam goes upstairs, ostensibly to use the bathroom but really to try on Alvin's mother's dresses. As the others are downstairs discussing their travels, upstairs he prances in a dress, hat, high heels and purse. Upon hearing Alvin's father climbing the stairs, Sam hangs from the window ledge to hide. Unable to hold on, he drops to the ground and walks to the sidewalk in front of the house, where his purse is snatched by a man running by. Women walking nearby gather to help him, then the police arrive. Insisting that he does not want to press charges, Sam struggles to hide his mustache. When another police car pulls up with its siren blaring, everyone in Alvin's parents' home steps outside to investigate. Sam tells the police that he is three months pregnant, prompting Alvin's father to invite him inside. At that point, Tess recognizes him, shouting ""She's my husband."" Later, in bed, Tess tells her husband that she does not mind that he is ""diseased and perverted,"" and pleased that she is so understanding, he agrees to see a doctor about his condition.""What Are Sex Perverts?""The television game show ""What's My Perversion?"" begins with a commercial for hair conditioner that features two football players in a locker room. As the ad ends, the men begin kissing. Jack Barry emcees the show, which asks celebrity panelists Pamela Mason, Regis Philbin, Toni Holt and Robert Q. Lewis to guess a contestant's deviant sexual preference, based on the answers to questions they pose. Contestant Bernard Jaffe, who likes to expose himself on subways, answers a series of questions, but the panel cannot guess his perversion, speculating that perhaps he is a rapist or child molester. Later, one lucky winner acts out his fantasy on air: Rabbi Chaim Baumel, a silk stockings fetishist, is tied up and whipped while his wife sits at his feet eating pork.""Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research and Experiments Accurate?""Victor Shakapopulis (Woody Allen in another role), a sexual phenomena researcher, stops at a gas station on his way to the home of Dr. Bernardo (John Carradine), a renowned sex expert with whom he plans to work. Helen Lacey (Heather MacRae), a young reporter planning to interview Bernardo, tells him her car has broken down, so he offers her a ride. At Bernardo's mansion, the door is opened by hunchback Igor. Bernardo enters and whips Igor, then serves dinner, at which the two younger visitors praise the doctor and his innovative findings. He notes that although he was thrown out of the Masters and Johnson Institute for Sexual Studies and labeled insane, he initiated dozens of major findings in the field. He then takes them to his laboratory, where Victor and Helen are horrified to see the experiments being performed on unwilling human subjects: one man has sex with a huge loaf of bread, while the brain of a lesbian is being transported into a man who works for the telephone company. Bernardo holds them at gunpoint and declares that Helen will be the subject of his new experiment, in which he will test her heart rate while she is ""gang-banged"" by twenty Boy Scouts. Igor restrains Victor and straps Helen down, but Victor escapes, grabs Bernardo's gun and shoots into the lab, ruining his equipment. As the lab begins to burn, Victor frees Helen and they flee. Bernardo and Igor are trapped in the ensuing explosion.Outside, the car will not start, and Victor and Helen witness a giant breast burst out of the house and move toward them. They race to the sheriff to report the ""fiendish tit"" on the loose. Meanwhile, a couple parked nearby is attacked by the breast. Victor plots to destroy it, and so lures it out into a field. Dodging the milk it squirts at him, he holds up a cross and leads it into a giant bra, trapping it. Walking with an admiring Helen, Victor decides that some things about sex are better left unknown.""What Happens During Ejaculation?""In a mission control center inside one man's brain, operators are busily controlling all his bodily functions. The main operator (Tony Randall) signals the eyes to show him the man's dinner date and agrees with the controller (Burt Reynolds) that there is some likelihood of sexual activity later. The sperm prepare to launch, hoping this is not another false alarm. The operator directs the man to attempt to make love to his date in his car. Engineers winch up the penis, but the workers fail to keep the erection upright. All of the body systems check in with each other to locate the problem, and finally a 45-degree erection is achieved. As he lines up for penetration, one sperm (played by Woody Allen) is scared to go out, but his friend reminds him that he took an oath to fertilize an ovum or die trying. Suddenly, the erection once again flags, and the operators scramble to alleviate the problem, which is revealed to be a priest in the conscience room turning up the guilt mechanism. Jettisoning the priest, the main operator calls ""Full steam ahead."" In the erection room, the laborers sing ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" while the sperm play a melancholy tune, then launch. When the orgasm is completed, the controllers celebrate with champagne and cigarettes. In the car, the date asks to ""go again,"" and the main operator signals the gonads that ""We're going for a record."""

Night of the Lepus,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069005/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Giant mutant rabbits terrorize the south-west. Cole Hillman's Arizona ranch is plagued with 'mongrel' rabbits, and he wants to employ an ecologically sound control method. As a favor to college benefactor Hillman, college president Elgin Clark calls in zoologist Roy Bennett to help. Bennett immediately begins injecting rabbits with hormones and genetically mutated blood in an effort to develop a method of disrupting rabbit reproduction. One of the test subjects escapes, resulting in a race of bloodthirsty, wolf-sized, man-, horse-, and cow-eating bunnies. Eventually the National Guard is called in for a final showdown with the terrorizing rabbits.—Jeff Hole <jeffhole@aol.com> In Arizona, the rancher Cole Hillman has his lands invaded by rabbits and he asks to the college president Elgin Clark an ecologic alternative to poison to get rid of the rabbits. Elgin contacts the researcher Roy Bennett and he goes with his wife Gerry and their daughter Amanda to the ranch. Roy collects samples and uses hormones in the rabbits expecting to sterilize the rabbits. However her daughter takes one of the injected rabbits with her but Amanda accidentally lets the animal escape. Soon the animal reproduces in an abandoned mine becoming a new breed of huge carnivorous rabbits.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Cole Hillman's Arizona ranch, in the decimation of the local coyote population, has been overrun by what have become feral rabbits, wreaking havoc in more ways than one. He doesn't want to use poison to kill them fearing that solution worse than the problem. He consults with his friend, local college president Elgin Clark, who believes he has the people for the job. Visiting scholars, husband and wife Roy and Gerry Bennett, have been doing research on biological methods of pest control, and although their current research looks at bats to control the mosquito population, they believe they may be able to find a biological method to control the rabbits. Wanting to test their theory of hormones to disrupt the rabbits' reproduction, Roy and Gerry capture a few of the rabbits to bring into their laboratory. In her love of rabbits, the Bennetts' adolescent daughter, Amanda Bennett, accidentally allows one of the rabbits that had been injected with an experimental serum to escape back into the wild. What happens is that a mutation occurs within that one rabbit spreading through the wild rabbit population creating a race of giant killer rabbits who maul and mutilate their largely human prey. The collective have to find a way to kill these giant killer rabbits before they decimate the local human population, with Gerry and Amanda's lives in greater risk as they become separated from Roy and anyone who may be able to help them.—Huggo The movie opens showing a news report about how overpopulation is not just a human problem, but exists in the animal kingdom as well, using the rabbit population explosion in Australia in the 1950s as an example. There was a similar plague of rabbits getting out of hand in the American Southwest, especially in Arizona, where the rabbits were devouring crops, destroying property, and out-competing livestock for a finite supply of food and water.Moving to the action in Arizona, our first view is of rancher Cole Hillman, riding his horse. The horse steps into a rabbit hole and injures itself, and Cole must shoot it and walk home. He instructs one of his ranch hands to take the truck to go get his saddle, then makes a phone call to the university in Ajo, hoping to find a cure for the rabbit infestation. He meets Dr. Elgin Clark, but his first suggestion is for the same person who killed all the coyotes that were keeping the rabbits in check. Cole is hesitant to make the same mistake twice, but agrees to visit the Bennett family, scientific researchers who are looking for more ecologically friendly ways of controlling wildlife.We meet the Bennetts, father Roy, mother Gerry, and daughter Amanda. Roy was capturing bats for an experiment. They want to control the bats' flight pattern, hoping to use them to kill mosquitoes, without the nasty side effects of DDT and other insecticides. Elgin Clark comes to see him and asks him to visit Cole, to see if he could come up with an ecologically friendly way to solve the rabbit problem. On the way there, they see ranchers desperately shooting at rabbits trying to preserve their livelihoods.At Cole's ranch, Cole explains his problem. Although hardly an environmentalist, Cole has reasons of his own for not wanting to use poison to kill the rabbits. The poison would harm his cattle, so he would have to sell them at distress prices, and eventually his land would become toxic and barren. He can hold out only a few more weeks before using the cyanide, and the other ranchers are anxious to use it sooner. Roy suggests interfering with the rabbits' hormones, or introducing a disease that affects only rabbits, and takes several rabbits with him to begin experiments. Meanwhile, their daughter Amanda becomes friends with Cole's son Jackie.Back at the university, the experiments are not producing any useful results. They will never have a solution in time to save Cole's ranch. He tries one last injection, in an untested rabbit, over the objections of Amanda, who has become attached to the rabbit in question. While her parents' backs are turned, the mischievous little girl switches the rabbit with another one from the control group, hoping to protect it from further harm. Then she pesters her parents into letting her adopt it as a pet. They think that the rabbit is from the control group and thus has had no injections.They return to Cole's ranch to pick up more rabbits for experimentation, but Jackie does not like Amanda's new pet, since the rabbits are a menace to his family and they killed his chickens at one point. He seizes the rabbit and releases it, and it runs away. Amanda forgives him and they go off together to talk.At the university, the experiments have failed. Some of the rabbits have grown enormously, but are otherwise unaffected. Roy, depsite his misgivings, calls Cole to tell him to do what he needs to do. Cole has one more try, though. He sets part of his range on fire, sacrificing some of his land in hopes of creating a strip of charred land that is completely devoid of food and water, that the rabbits will not be able to cross. Some of the other ranchers are skeptical, but they trust Cole's judgment enough to delay their own use of poisons a little longer. The fire drives away the rabbits, for awhile.While inspecting the land, the Bennetts and Cole find an unusual animal track. They don't know what the animal was, but they know that it was big. Meanwhile, Jackie takes Amanda to meet a friend of his, Captain Billy, who has a gold mine in the hills. Arriving at the mine, they find no one home. He sends Amanda into the mine to look while he looks outside. Jackie finds more animal tracks, while Amanda sees the shadows of enormous rabbits. Then she sees a dead body, presumably that of Billy. She screams and runs out of the mine. We next see her being examined by a doctor, who determines she only had a shock and will be fine. Jackie describes what he could remember, but everything happened very fast; he doesn't remember much.At night, a driver with a refrigerated truck stops to check his truck, and hears the thunder of paws and heavy breathing nearby, but it's too dark to see what's going on. He fails to get back in the truck while the getting is good, and is attacked by the rabbits. The next morning, a policeman finds the abandoned truck, its cargo of vegetables scattered over the ground, and then finds the driver's body. He calls for the sheriff to examine the body. While he is there, he gets a call. The body has been recovered from the mine, and it is Captain Billy, looking as badly mutilated as the truck driver.Back in town, the coroner determines that the bodies and boxes of vegetables were not chopped with an axe, but were chewed or gnawed. He can't think of what animal could cause so much destruction, except maybe a saber-toothed tiger. Meanwhile, another policeman finds more mutilated bodies nearby.At the university, Roy and Elgin realize that the huge rabbits that Amanda saw are likely the cause of the destruction, and are probably the result of their experiment. They debate calling the sheriff, but Elgin, fearing the bad publicity that it would draw to the university, talks them out of it until they can gather more evidence. Roy tells Gerry to go call Cole, intending to go see him the next day to look for the rabbits, and try to destroy them.The next day, Elgin, the Bennetts, Cole, and his ranch hands Frank and Jud, arrive at the mine with cyanide and dynamite. Elgin and Frank go up into the hills to look for more holes and plant dynamite, while Jud and Cole plant dynamite at the main entrance. Elgin drops a rock into one of the holes and listens to the noises the rabbits make in reaction, holding out his radio microphone so that Roy and Gerry can hear it too. Roy and Cole go into the mine, hoping to capture a rabbit, or if that isn't possible, take a picture. They go in, camera and shotgun in hand. The others are apprehensive as Roy and Cole remain inside the mine, out of reach. Finally, Roy and Cole reach the chamber where the rabbits are holed up, and realize that using the gun may cause a cave in. They see them clearly for the first time, describing them as big as wolves and just as vicious. Roy takes several pictures, but the rabbits start to chase them, and they must escape. They didn't mark their way, so they are in danger of making a wrong turn and becoming trapped. Meanwhile, another giant rabbit burrows out of the ground outside and attacks Jud, and Gerry must save him by shooting the rabbit, and treat his injuries. Time passes, and the groups outside become more worried for Roy and Cole's safety. Finally, they reach the entrance of the mine and run out, and Elgin sets off the dynamite, collapsing the mine and burying many rabbits.At the university, Elgin examines the photographs, and he realizes that it is time to inform the sheriff. They plan to go back to the mine the next day, to make sure all the rabbits are dead. Roy, realizing that the press will be all over the place soon, advises Gerry to take Amanda and go to another town, for their privacy, until the whole thing blows over. Next, we see rabbits leaving the mine; obviously the cave-in left a significant number of them to escape and raise more havoc. The thunder of paws panics Cole's horses, waking him up. The horses soon escape. Cole gets his family together in the storm shelter under his house, while the rabbits attack the horses. Jud, still panicked from his encounter with the rabbits earlier, runs to the truck and flees. He encounters the herd of rabbits and quickly turns around and drives back to the ranch. In his panic, he crashes the truck, knocking out the phone lines to Cole's house, just when Cole was trying to call for help. Jud runs from the truck, but the rabbits have arrived and they pounce on him. Cole shoots at them, but it's too late to save Jud. He joins his family in the shelter. There is a tense moment as the rabbits try to scratch through the door, but they are driven off. The rabbits get into the house's main floor and destroy everything inside. Cole and Frank keep them from scratching through the floor by shooting at them.At the store in the town of Galanos, the switchboard operator Mildred is unsure what to think of Cole's telephone line going out suddenly, while Cole sounded agitated. It's late, so her husband and a friend take off to go home. Soon, she can hear the thunder of paws, too, and she looks out the window to check. The rabbits have arrived and they jump through the window to pounce on her. The rabbits also reach her house, where they catch and kill her husband before he can get inside.In the morning, Cole and Frank go outside; the rabbits have holed up somewhere for the day. They mourn Jud, and Cole tells Frank to stay with Jackie while he goes to town. The horses are gone and his truck is wrecked, so his only option is to walk, shotgun in hand. Meanwhile, Roy sends Gerry and Amanda off in their RV to Wooddale. She promises him to call him when she gets there. Roy and Elgin contact the sheriff, who has already been informed of the rabbits. They get into a helicopter to check the area around the mine. Meanwhile, Cole has a long walk. He tries to flag down passing motorists, but traffic is light, and few people are going to pick up a man with a shotgun. Perhaps realizing this, Cole ditches the gun and continues. Gerry's RV becomes stuck in the sand on the way to Wooddale, leaving her and Amanda stranded.Hours later, Cole finally makes it to town, and finds the store that was attacked by the rabbits the previous night. The rabbits are still inside, feasting on the food as they wait for the sun to go down. Finding no help here, Cole takes off again on foot, needing to find help, or at least shelter, before dark. During the day, Roy, Elgin, and the sheriff arrive at the mine, and they find it empty. The sheriff calls the National Guard. In the afternoon, Cole finally is able to get a ride with a priest.The sheriff gets authorization to use the National Guard, but he is unable to contact Cole, since the switchboard at Galanos is out. Cole, riding with the priest, finally reaches a phone and calls in, and tells the sheriff where the rabbits are. The sheriff sends a deputy out to pick him up, but it will be dark soon, and the National Guard will not be able to arrive in time to catch the rabbits before they start moving again. They will likely move toward Ajo, so the sheriff decides to evacuate the town. Meanwhile, Roy is getting worried, since he has not yet heard from Gerry. It gets dark, and the rabbits start to move again, leaving the ruins of Galanos behind. The policemen get more reports of death and destruction from the areas in the rabbits' path and proceed with the evacuation as best as they can. His deputy, who has picked up Cole, reports that the rabbits are right behind them, moving fast and coming in a front about two miles wide, and they have but 50 minutes to prepare before the rabbits reach Ajo.The National Guard major realizes he doesn't have enough men to handle a front of rabbits that long. Roy has an idea involving using the railroad. He calls the railroad dispatcher, and asks him to isolate a siding near town. The deputies can then hook electrical power up to the isolated section of railroad, and the rabbits will be electrocuted as they cross it. The National Guard will use its men to funnel the rabbits onto this section of railroad. However, there is a freight train on the tracks, and they will have to wait for it to pass before implementing the plan.Needing more help, the sheriff goes to the local drive-in movie theater, and enlists the help of the patrons. He has them line up their cars with the lights on to help drive the rabbits in the desired direction. Roy still hasn't heard from Gerry, and he asks the sheriff to check. There have been no calls, and Elgin has called Wooddale and Gerry has not yet arrived. He asks the sheriff to being the helicopter back so that he can go look for her.Meanwhile, Gerry and Amanda are still trying to free their RV from the sand. It's dark now, and they have made no progress. Hearing the noises from the rabbits in the distance, Gerry sends Amanda into the RV while she gets the emergency flares from the glove compartment. From the air, Roy can see lots of rabbits on the road that Gerry was supposed to take. The rabbits arrive at the RV, and Gerry holds them at bay with the flares, but she has a finite supply of them. Finally, the helicopter arrives. The noise and lights drive off the rabbits, and the family is saved. The rabbits attack a herd of cattle instead, causing a stampede.The sheriff has the deputies ready to electrify the railroad, but the train still hasn't cleared the tracks, and the rabbits are getting closer to town. Roy and his family return in the helicopter and the deputy turns the power off just as the train starts passing, amid more reports of death and destruction from the area. When the train passes, the men set wooden stakes in the railroad to keep the section of track isolated, and then turn the power on. The trap is set. Soon, the rabbits come into sight, and the National Guardsmen start shooting at them. The lights from the cars repulse the rabbits just as hoped, and they run straight for the railroad. When they reach it, the electricity does it work, killing the rabbits that reach the tracks. Sparks fly from the overtaxed transformers overhead, but the power stays on. Few rabbits make it past, and the men have no trouble shooting them with their guns. Eventually, the ground is covered with thousands of dead rabbits.Some time later, Cole reports that life is getting back to normal and he has repaired his ranch. Better still, some coyotes have been heard nearby, keeping the normal rabbits in check naturally. He invites them to visit the ranch some time."

They pound the pavements then duck into the doorway of a dilapidated building and wait for the first unlucky dude to come through. Priest (Ron O'Neal) is a thin, light skinned Black man with shoulder length relaxed hair and a handle-bar mustache. After making love and snorting some coke, he tells one of his girlfriends, a White woman (Polly Niles), he's got to leave. He's got to make a 'pickup.' He gets dressed-designer fedora and a classy long coat--gets into his Cadillac Eldorado, and rolls through the streets of New York City. The Caddy is a black, tricked out, two-door convertible, customized with a Rolls Royce-inspired grill and oversized headlamps. Unbeknown to Priest, the junkies are waiting as he arrives for his pickup. They jump him as he walks through the door. In the fight that follows one of the junkies gets away. With Curtis Mayfield's frenetic 'Junkie Chase' on the soundtrack, Priest takes off after him on foot, down the street, through grimy back alleys and vacant lots. He chases the junkie up a fire escape and crashes through an apartment window. Priest puts the boots to him in front of a family who had been sleeping--a woman and two kids.Priest's pad. Fat Freddie (Charles MacGregor) and his drug dealer partner arrive. Freddie is one of Priest's fifty dealers. He doesn't have the money he owes Priest. Priest wants his money. If he doesn't get his money 'tonight' he's going to put Freddie's young wife out on 'whore's row.' Priest gives Freddie a gun. Freddie pleads; he doesn't want to have anything to do with violence. Priest insists he get the money, then meet him that night at 'Scatter's' - a nightclub owned by an old-school drug dealer, and Priest's mentor.Eddie (Carl Lee), Priest's partner, is shooting craps with a bunch of guys. Priest wants to talk to him. Eddie knows it's serious since Priest never comes around when he's hanging with his gambling buddies. Priest and Eddie go to Eddie's apartment. He tells Eddie he's getting out. Out of the cocaine business. Eddie laughs. 'You gonna give all this up. Eight track stereo, color TV in every room, and can snort a half a piece of dope every day.' Priest asks how much money they have. Three hundred thousand, one fifty each, enough to keep your nose open for about a year. Eddie knows it's a rotten game, but it's the only one 'the man' left them to play, 'and that's the stone cold truth.' Priest lays out his plan. They're going to take that 300,000. They're going to buy thirty 'keys' of coke, and in four months they can turn it into a million dollars. Half a million each. Enough for them to live on for the rest of their lives. Eddie doesn't believe they can get thirty keys for that price. Priest says they'll get the coke from his mentor, Scatter. Eddie doesn't believe him. Priest says he has to get out, before he kills somebody, or somebody 'ices' him. 'Are you with me?' Eddie nods. 'Solid.'Little Child Running Wild. Freddie and his partner are in a car waiting for a 'fat cat.' A middle aged White man appears and gets into a Cadillac. They follow him until its dark. The man stops and gets out. Freddie, in a stocking mask, runs up behind him and pulls the gun Priest gave him. You know what this is. Give me your money.Pusher Man. Later that night Priest and Eddie meet at Scatter's nightclub. The Curtis Mayfield Experience is on stage performing the tune 'Pusher Man'. Scatter (Julius Harris), the owner and chef, invites Priest and Eddie to the kitchen. Priest offers Scatter some coke. Scatter takes it: 'Now that's what I need...What you come to see Scatter about?' Priest tells him he's got $300,000 and wants to buy 'thirty keys' which he'll deal in four months. He'll make a million in cash and he's off the street forever. Scatter says he isn't dealing anymore. He's out of the business. He's retired. Priest presses Scatter. He wants to get out while he's still young. He can get into something else. 'Do it for me; you can depend on me for the rest of your life.' No reply. 'Then turn me on to your man.' If he did that, Scatter says, he'd be killed. Priest: If Scatter doesn't help him out, he'll get the coke anyway. It'll take longer, but he's going to get it. One way or another. Scatter thinks for a moment, and smiles. He's got one key left in his personal stash. They can come around tomorrow night and pick it up. As for the thirty keys, maybe he'll do it for them. 'But this is the last time.'At an after-hours club, Priest orders a 'nice cold beer' and manages a faint smile. Things are finally looking up. Freddie shows up with his wife and his dealer partner. 'How did we do tonight, Freddie?' Freddie dumps a wad of cash on the table. Priest returns some of the cash. A gift. Freddie's wife takes it. She leaves to play a song on the jukebox.

She can't be just another 'someone he's got to deal with.' She loves him. They share a passionate kiss and make love in the tub.Freddie's Dead. Freddie uses a set of brass knuckles to viciously beat a man behind a building. He's arrested and interrogated by four detectives. He's bloodied and crying. 'You mean you beat a man half to death because he touched your wife's hand,' asks the lead detective. They slap Freddie around. They lay his gun and packages of dope on the table. They don't want him--they want his man, the guy he's working for. Freddie finally gives Priest up and tells them about the pickup Priest has arranged with Scatter. The police prepare to take Freddie 'downtown' where he'll be booked. As he's taken out of the police station Freddie breaks away and runs into the street. He's struck and killed by an oncoming car.In a park, Priest tells Georgia of his plan to get them both out of the business. Georgia asks him what he's going to do when he gets out. He doesn't know. But he'll have a choice. He could buy some time, time to be free. She asks him if that'll make him happy. He doesn't know, but he can't be happy the way things are now.That night four plainclothes officers apprehend Priest on the street. They push him and Eddie into a doorway. Priest has the one 'key' from Scatter. The police know that Scatter has been trying to get out of the business; that he hasn't dealt 'direct' for over a year. They also know that Priest just picked up one key from his mentor, and that Scatter just ordered 'thirty more.' Are they working for Scatter? Eddie says they are. The cops want a piece of Priest's action. In return they'll provide protection .The police shake Eddie's hand. 'You'll see that I'm good, stand-up people.' The police leave, and Eddie is elated. They've got it made. 'If we can make a million in four months, imagine what we can make in four years...Just think about it.' Priest says he's thinking about thirty keys.A photo montage of the cocaine dealing process. The initial agreement. Procurement. Cutting. Packaging. Distributing. Selling. Coke lines. Coke spoons. Snorting. Users of different races. Black. White. Construction workers. Business executives. Male. Female. Stacks and stacks of cash.Priest and Eddie are in a restaurant. Waiting for some people. Three 'militants' sit at their table, uninvited. They're trying to build a new nation for Black people. Dope peddlers owe Black people something, and it's time the dope dealers to pay up. Priest says he isn't giving them anything as long as they're just talking. Go get a gun and put your words into action and he'll be right there with them. Otherwise go sing your marching songs somewhere else. The militants leave and Priest's dealers show up. They snort his stuff. They ask how much. 'Let's get it on.'Priest is with his White girlfriend, Cynthia, at her apartment. Her friends want to buy a pound of coke. The telephone rings. Scatter is downstairs. 'Send him up.' When Scatter arrives Priest tells his girl to go into the bedroom, even though it's her apartment. Scatter is now running for his life. His protector, his boss, is now trying to kill him. He needs money. Priest has $20,000, which he'll get from Georgia's place and give him later that night. Before Scatter leaves, he gives Priest a manila envelope with incriminating information about his long-time contact, his 'boss,' the mastermind behind the whole business. Scatter leaves the apartment. Three men in trench coats surround him on the sidewalk. They snap handcuffs on him. The skipper wants to see him. The hustle him into a waiting Rolls Royce. They roll up his sleeve and stick a needle in his arm.Super Fly. Priest hears of Scatter's death. He picks up a gun in his pad and drives to a restaurant where he meets two White men. Through the window we see them shake hands and start talking. He gives them the manila envelope. He also gives them a bulging white envelope with the dimensions of a large wad of cash. They shake hands again, and he leaves.Priest is back at Eddie's pad. He's carrying a black satchel. He wants to get out now. Things are worse than they were before. The guy who put the hit on Scatter will use them and then kill them. 'People been using me all my life,' Eddie says. 'I'm glad he's using me...because I'm gonna make a piss pot full of money...Yeah, this is the life. I could be nothin' nowhere else...' Priest asks, suppose he can figure a way out for both of them. Eddie says he's not going with Priest. Priest pushes the satchel into Eddie's chest. 'Fill it.' 'Why don't you fill it?' ''Cause I want to keep my eyes on you every minute, Eddie.' Eddie goes to a clothes closet, opens a safe, and fills the satchel with cash. Priest takes the satchel and leaves. Eddie picks up the phone. 'He just left the apartment.' The police send a car to pick Priest up. Priest boards the elevator. On the way down, a woman enters. She's wearing a large headscarf, and holds her head down so we can't see her face. She opens a large shopping bag. There's a satchel identical to the one Priest is carrying. They switch satchels, and she balls up pieces of fabric and covers the satchel. Priest gently lifts her chin and kisses her on the lips. Georgia smiles. The elevator door opens and they go in separate directions. Priest approaches his Caddy. Two uniformed police officers stop him. Priest places his hands on the roof of the car. One of the patrolmen calls in the arrest. Yeah, they've got the briefcase too. The lieutenant replies that three detectives are on their way to take custody. As the police are on the radio, Priest watches Georgia walking in the distance, clutching bundles of cloth over the satchel. The detectives arrive. They stuff Priest into the back of an unmarked police car. One detective drives Priest's Caddy.They take Priest to a deserted area, maybe a riverfront shipyard. Priest finally meets the big boss. Scatter's former boss. 'So you're Priest,' the boss man says. 'I thought you were going to be the best dealer I ever had. What do you want to quit for? What else can you do...You're making more money than you ever did in your life.' Priest snorts some coke from a small spoon hanging from his neck. The boss sticks his finger in Priest's chest. 'You're going to work for me until I tell you to quit.' 'You don't own me, pig,' says Priest. And no one tells him when he can split. 'Who do you think you're talking to,' the boss says. Priest insults him to his face. A detective punches Priest in the jaw. A fist fight follows, finishing with Priest throwing one of the detectives headfirst into a garbage can. Priest turns around. The boss is pointing a gun at his head. 'You move a muscle and I'll kill you.' Priest says, 'Kill me, Reardon. Kill me like you killed Scatter, and you're one dead pig.' Deputy Commissioner Reardon is shocked that Priest knows his identity. 'What did you call me?' Priest says, yes, he knows who he is, and who every member of his family is. If Reardon kills him, the whole Reardon family dies. He took out a $100,000 contract out on Reardon's life, his family's life. 'If I choke on chicken bone all the Reardons is dead.' 'You ain't got a hundred thousand dollars. Not anymore,' Reardon says. One of the detectives opens the satchel. Pieces of cloth. 'I think you ought to know something, cap'n. I hired the very best killers there are. White killers. So you better take good care of me, baby. Nothing...NOTHING better happen to one hair on my gorgeous head. Can you dig it?'Priest backs away, turns past the detectives, gets into his Caddy and drives away. The camera pans up, way up, to the top of the Empire State Building in the distance."

Alex and Patricia inform a police officer about Manfred, Alex and the officer return to the stairwell to Alex's surprise find that Manfred has vanished. Inspector Calhoun (Donald Pleasence) is assigned to look into the disappearance. Calhoun antagonistically questions Alex, who asserts the man was a drunk, and suggests he and Patricia robbed the man.While discussing the case of the missing Manfred, Calhoun's colleague Detective Sgt. Rogers (Norman Rossington) tells him about the history of the London Underground, particularly the Victorian railway workers who constructed the tunnels under dire conditions, and an urban legend that a group of descendants who survived an 1892 cave-in still live below ground in an abandoned section of the tunnels.Meanwhile, one of the last surviving members of a family of these railway workers (Hugh Armstrong) watches his sick, pregnant, female companion (June Turner) die; they have survived since birth in the underground by resorting to cannibalism of the railway patrons. In an empty chamber, Manfred's body lies, mutilated beside other decomposing bodies of various victims. The man laments the woman's death, as he is now left in complete solitude. The man goes into a rage and brutally murders three Underground maintenance workers in, taking one to his lair to feed on.Calhoun remains suspicious of Alex and Patricia, and calls Alex in for repeated interrogations. After seeing a film one night, Alex and Patricia take a train home and get off at Holborn station. While de-boarding, Patricia realizes she forgot her textbooks on the train. Alex attempts to retrieve them, but the doors close before he can exit; just as the train leaves, Patricia yells through the window that she will meet him at home. Once the train exits the platform, Patricia is attacked by the cannibal man and incapacitated.When Patricia fails to meet him at their flat, Alex seeks help from Calhoun, who is dismissive of him. Alex returns to Holborn station to search for Patricia, and enters the tunnel against the orders of a station attendant. He manages to breach an abandoned area of the Underground that had caved in, and finds the skeletal remnants of the miners who worked there over a century ago.Meanwhile, Patricia awakens in the cannibal's lair. She finds him to be aphasic and unable to communicate with her. When he begins grabbing her aggressively, she hits him over the head and manages to flee, escaping into a tunnel. He finally corners her and attempts to communicate with her, speaking in the only line that he knows: ""mind the doors""- having heard the phrase repeatedly from train conductors at the tube stations. But the man becomes frustrated when Patricia does not reply and he violently attacks her.Alex stumbles upon the scene and begins fighting with the cannibal, stomping him on the head. Patricia, however, begs Alex not to hurt him, and they watch as the cannibal stumbles into a passageway. Calhoun, Rogers and several other police detectives who have entered the Underground discover Alex and Patricia. As they search through the abandoned section of the Underground tunnel, the detectives uncover a room full of corpses laid in bunk beds - the generations of survivors from the cave-in that occurred a century before. There they find the cannibal, bleeding profusely, and he collapses in front of them, apparently dead. The detectives return meet Alex and Patricia, who have been waiting outside the cannibal's lair, and they all head to the station platform to call in backup and a forensics crew. After they leave, the cannibal screams ""Mind the doors!"" revealing that he is still alive.End credits"

English country squire Sir Hugo Cunningham (Robert Stephens) arrives to his manor house, where his two sons -one adopted, Giles (Robert Powell), the other one being Clive (Ralph Arliss)- and one daughter, Christina (Jane Lapotaire) are already waiting for him. The three children are grown-ups now. He introduces to them his fiancée, Anna Wheatley (Fiona Walker), whom he intends to marry the following Saturday. The father also announces that he's brought with him a special camera.At the manor house library, Hugo explains to Anna that he enjoys taking photographs of dead people. He is not alone on this weird passtime, as his friend Sir Edward Barrett (Alex Scott) also enjoys so.We see a slide presentation in front of a small audience. Edward and Hugo explain that they found a dark romboidal stain in photographs of people who had just died. They think they have photographed the souls of the people who died leaving the body. Hugo tries to explain to Clive - who looks like his favourite son - that with power comes responsibility when the son comments on Hugo's generosity towards the waiting servant. He also says that death is the last change. Hugo still misses his late wife.It's March at the manor house during Hugo and Anna's visit, and it's freezing cold. He insists to record everybody soaring on a boat. First, it's Giles and Christina, then Clive and Anna. Clive's oar gets stuck in the mud, which causes him not to see a branch of a tree. A sharp pointed part of the tree stings him, who falls to the muddy river. Anna also falls to the water. Giles tries to rescue them but the water is so muddy that he can't see anything. Clive and Anna's muddy body will appear later on during the night.Two weeks later, Hugo checks on the motion picture. There appears the same black stain, so he decides to photograph the two-week old corpse of Clive.Giles is worried about Hugo's unhealthy obsession, because it causes him to disregard himself. Hugo starts thinking about the Asphyx, a spirit which appears near people who are about to die. Hugo starts looking a bit out of his mind, even asking Giles to photograph him while drinking a cup of poison.There is going to be a public hanging the following day, says Edward. Hugo wants to photograph the execution.Hugo kills a mouse so that the Asphyx appears and he can imprison it in a kind of laboratory tube with strange liquids. With a strong lamp, Giles has captured in in the halo of light. Christina appears to question what the racket was about.Later, Christina goes on her own and takes the guinea pig out. She wonders at the strange box at his father's laboratory. Hugo -with Giles at his tail as usual- goes to visit a home for the paupers. There, one of the homeless men (Terry Scully) is severely ill.Christina questions Giles about what she saw at the laboratory. Giles is worried for Hugo but can't explain it all to her because he swore to secrecy. Christina tries to console Giles even though he can't confide on her. Hugo gives the sick man home, food and shelter. The bump is so sick that he'll only live one or two days more, says the doctor. The homeless man coughs and coughs. When he is about to die, the Asphyx appears, and Hugo captures it with the strong focus light. However, in his last moments, the dying man picks up the acid which Hugo had shown Giles before, and he splashes mit all over Hugo's face. He will be left with the scar for the rest of his life. Christina has been woken up by the acute shrieks of the Asphyx, so she arrives to the laboratory to see it all.Hugo has the idea of electrocuting himself in an electric chair while Giles traps the Asphyx. Christina appears and panics, but Giles slaps her and she is the one who moves the light to trap the Asphyx inside the coffin-shaped box. Giles and Christina put the Asphyx inside of a safe box. That night, Christina is woken up by something in her bedroom: it's the guinea pig she's let loose before. She takes the mouse outside of the house and releases it just outside the door. It looks like the mouse prefers to stay inside, where he is safe and has food, water and shelter without having to survive by itself!So Hugo recovers from the electrocution. He has not died.From that moment on, Hugo behaves weirdly. He wants Anna to marry Giles -is that even possible legally?- so that they have children and the lineage goes on forever. Christina doesn't like his father's plans, but she finally obliges. Hugo wants to make them immortal, the same as him. First goes Christina. Hugo wants to trap the Asphyx when it appears to claim her. They are going to cut her head with a gillotine. But the mouse she released appears to bite off the pipe which carries the water to make the lights work. The light goes out, in the panic Hugo causes Giles to release the guillotine, and Christina dies because her head was severed off.Giles feels guilt of Christina's death. Hugo wants to die now: he wants to join his children. Giles puts the mouse inside the lamp, and doesn't allow Hugo to check it before attempting to catch the Asphynx again. Giles has thought about the way: he will be enclosed in a plastic box and then Hugo will put gas in through a pipe. When Giles is about to die and the lamp doesn't work, Hugo has time to put oxygen in. But Giles wants to die, so he takes a match out. He softly whispers ""Christina"", and lights the match. That causes an explosion. At that moment, Hugo realises that he has killed his two remaining children. Hugo is not alone though: he has as a companion... the mouse.BACK TO MODERN TIMESA man - Hugo with a completely disfigured head - caresses a mouse.

On his deathbed Tudor-king Henry VIII remembers his long reign and especially the crucial part his six marriages played in it, without producing the male heir he desired most to prevent civil wars for the succession as England suffered before his father's ascent. His first queen, Spanish princess Kathryn of Aragon, had one fatal flaw: her children died, except daughter Mary, so he pressed Rome for an annulment, and when that failed out went cardinal Wolsey as chief minister and Henry made himself head of the Church of England instead of the papacy and married Anne Boleyn. When she too failed to produce a male heir, just princess Elisabeth, he had her head roll for 'infidelity'. The third queen, gentle Jane Seymour, died giving birth to sickly prince Edward. For diplomatic reasons Henry married minor princess Anne of Cleves, whose utter lack of female charms causes another annulment and the fall of Thomas Cromwell, who recommended her.

A rich but racist man is dying and hatches an elaborate scheme for transplanting his head onto another man's body. His health deteriorates rapidly, and doctors are forced to transplant his head onto the only available candidate: a black man from death row.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> In California, the renowned Dr. Maxwell Kirshner is a brilliant transplant surgeon and owner of the Kirshner Transplant Institute. He is dying and develops a technique to transplant his head in another body in a gorilla. Kirshner, who is racist, hires the prominent Dr. Fred Williams to help in his surgery but when he sees that the doctor is black, he unsuccessfully tries to call off the contract. He uses his friendship with the Governor expecting to use the body of a convicted in death row that could donate his body to his experiment instead of being executed. The strong and black inmate Jack Moss accepts the offer expecting to get more thirty days to prove that he is innocent. However Dr. Philip Desmond immediately operates Kirshner and Jack, but he is not able to control Jack that escapes from Kirshner's house. Jack teams-up with his girlfriend Lila and Dr. Fred Williams, who is convinced of his innocence and decides to remove Kirshner's head. But how to find another compatible body for Dr. Kirshner?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A car pulls into a pathway and up to a vast mansion. A driver gets out and walks to the boot to get out a wheelchair. An Orderly comes out to open a rear door. Dr. Maxwell Kirshner (Ray Milland) is helped out of the car and put in a wheelchair. He gets wheeled up the steps and into the mansion.Kirshner asks if his experiment has been a success. He is told by the orderly that it has been. He is wheeled down the stairs into a basement where we see the experiment is in fact a two headed gorilla (Rick Baker) that Dr. Kirshner has in fact made. The experiment is to determine whether another head can survive on one single body. Dr Kirshner has done this because he hasn't got much longer to live and wants to transplant his still living head from his lifeless body and onto a another donor so that he may continue living and get back to working as the world's most successful surgeon. He approaches the bars of the cage that hold his new creature, even when told not to but he is unafraid. He says that the creature understands him and therefore will not hurt him.Dr Kirshner returns to his hospital institute to over look an operation done by his close friend and associate doctor named Phillip Desmond (Roger Perry). An onlooker asks why during the operation why he cant see more blood. He is told that both patients are hooked up to individual heart and lung machines and the blood is easily passed through plastic tubing all the time during the operation. Dr Kirshner returns back to the basement and his two headed gorilla to remove one of the heads from its body. A cage is opened to allow them to get inside from their original cage. The cage has no bottom layer so they use a table to place the cage on. Kirshner orders his assistants to sedate his creature but plans go awry when the creature is upset about the needle and knocks both the cage off of the table and Dr. Kirshner out of his wheelchair, hurting him severely. It then proceeds to smash up the lab and escapes. Kirshner tells the assistant to get the creature back as he doesn't have much time left to live. The creature runs away and into a supermarket where the assistants chase after it. The gorilla is found eating a banana in the fruit section of the supermarket. Kirshner hires a new doctor to help his friend with the transplant. Little does he realize that the new doctor is an African American and Kirshner hates African Americans. He is a bigot and a racist. He tells the new doctor that his services that were about to start are now no longer required because he doesn't want an African American doctor working anywhere near him or with him. He tells the African American doctor that he will be remembursed for his time and the original duration that he was supposed to be working for. The African American doctor whose name is Dr. Fred Williams (Don Marshall) takes great offence to this. Dr. Desmond sticks up for Dr. Williams saying whether he is African American or not, he is a damn good doctor.This disgusts Kirshner and he wheels himself out of the office. He returns once again back to the basement where he successfully removes the 2nd head of the creature. He calls his friend Dr Desmond and Desmond rushes over. He tells him he is ready for his own transplant to a healthy donor. Desmond is not sure about it until Kirshner tells him that the head that is now on the gorilla is in fact the 2nd head he put on. He had successfully removed the original gorillas head and replaced it with the 2nd transplanted one. Meanwhile on death row the convicts are told that if they donated their bodies to science, it will stop them getting the electric chair. One convict is lead to the chair which turns out to be an African American himself, a very big African American named Jack Moss (Roosevelt ""Rosey"" Gier). Just as they sit him in the chair, he decides to volunteer for the science experiment because he is innocent of the crime he was supposed to have committed and therefore he believes that in 30 days he will have freed himself of the accusation. The police, including Sergeant Hacker (Roger Gentry), escort Jack to the transplant center for this experiment they have been told about. The doctors are surprised to see a large African American being brought before them for this experiment knowing full well that when Kirshner wakes up, he isn't going to like what he sees. However the doctors work around the clock to transplant Dr Kirshner's head onto Jack's body.After the operation Kirshner wakes up and Desmond tells him that the operation was a success. Kirshner says he can feel the breath in his new lungs and that he can move his arm. Desmond tells him that they had no other choice but to transplant his head onto the African American's body. Kirshner says to Desmond ""is this part of a joke?"" Desmond tells him that he would not have lived another day if they hadn't of operated when they did.At that moment, Jack awakes and is freaked out by the fact that Kirshner's head is on his body. Kirshner tells him to shut up and rest so they can recuperate the energy to test drive his new body and try out his surgical procedures to become the world's greatest doctor again. Jack gets angry and try to get up from the table but Kirshner cries out for someone to sedate the Jack of the body, which Desmond does. Kirshner exhausted, tells Desmond that he couldn't control the Jack side of the body, he can only control the body if Jack is sedated or asleep. Kirshner is worried that Jack could harm his half of the body.Desmond tells him that he will keep the Jack side heavily sedated all the time while Kirshner regains the power to move the body. Leaving Kirshner to rest, Desmond meets up with Dr. Williams again and tells him he needs his help. Williams is reluctant at first because of Dr Kirshner but Desmond reassures him that his beliefs are not the same as Dr. Kirshner's and that his help is very much needed. Although Williams still doesn't know what has been asked of him, he is told by Desmond to go home and get some things together. Williams asks when he will find out what is going on in the room that is keeping Jack and Kirshner. Desmond tells him that he will find out in good time.Meanwhile a nurse (Britt Nilsson) comes to administer a sedation to Jack's side of the body. Jack tricks the nurse and wakes up, giving her the sedation needle instead by stabbing it into her bum. He tricks one of the cops outside the door to come in and knocks him unconscious. Grabbing the cops gun, he beats up the other cop and runs out of the building taking Williams with him/them. Williams drives the car under gunpoint by Jack and Desmond chases after them. Jack asks Williams if he can get rid of Kirshner's head off of his body. He tells Williams that if he won't help him then, as he will kill Kirshner and remove his head himself. Williams warns him that if he did that, he would be killing himself also. He also tells him that Kirshner's head can only be removed surgically if he wants a safe procedure.The police chase after Jack, Kirshner and Williams. Jack takes over driving and accidentally crashes the car and causes a flat tire. Williams sits with Kirshner and Jack beneath a tree and asks why Jack was on Death Row. Jack tells him that he was framed for a stick up that went wrong, a friend of his used a gun that Jack owned to knock off a store and he shot a cop. As the gun was Jack's and his prints were on the gun. Knowing that Jack was arrested for the murder, his friend ran away and Jack took the fall. Kirshner then tries to appeal to Williams by offering him the accolade of the transplant. Williams sees through his ploy and tells him that he insulted him and therefore would not accept his offer as it would mean that he would have to take off Jack's head from the body.All three of them run up a hill and find a motocross track. Jack watches as a motocross rider falls off his bike and Jack takes it and rides off round the motocross track with Kirshner and Williams riding also. Several bikes crash after seeing the two headed horror and soon the police are hot on their trail. Kirshner screams to Jack that he will get them all killed. Jack snaps back that he will get them out of this mess. Kirshner doesn't believe him and the bikes speeds towards a gap, a very deep gap which Jack easily jumps. The police cars chasing them, crash one after the other, some even land on each other. Luckily the cars are wrecked yet the cops are not injured.Jack rides the bike to his wife's house. Lila (Chelsea Brown) isn't that pleased to see him because of Kirshner's head is on his body. Jack asks his wife to kiss him, she almost does but is put off from the intimate moment by Kirshner's head. With a degree of sexual chemistry she then asks if he has two of everything meaning does he have two genitals. Jack laughs at this. Jack lays down to rest and Jack's wife Lila says she is gonna get dinner. Jack asks her to stay and he feels some sexual energy towards her. She is put off about this. Jack tells her that if Kirshner's head is putting her off that he will cover it with a pillow case. That doesn't change her mind and she walks off. Jack turns to Kirshner and tells him for interrupting his sexual activity that he has got to go.While Jack is sleeping Kirshner finds out that he can control the body almost fully. Kirshner is very happy about this. Jack, Kirshner, Williams and Lila sit down for dinner. Jack offers some to Kirshner who tells him he doesn't eat that kind of food. Lila says to Kirshner ""What's the matter baby, dont you like soul food?"". Kirshner replies with a bigot remark of ""What's for pudding? Watermelon?"" Jack tells Kirshner not to worry about the food as he is eating it not Kirshner. Lila strikes up a cigarette to which Kirshner asks for a cigarette. Lila gives him one and the smoke ends up coming out of Jack's mouth while he is eating. Disgusted by this, Jack takes the cigarette out of Kirshner's mouth and tells him not to smoke while he is eating. Lila asks what it will take to take Kirshner's head from Jack's body. Kirshner tells her that without a specially crafted surgical team, it is impossible to do the operation and both of them will die. Williams tells Kirshner that he is dead wrong about that, as the removal procedure is easily done without the aid of the surgical team.Williams drives to a medical warehouse to get what he needs for the operation. Frightened by what Williams has told him, Kirshner manages to take over Jack's body and starts playing around with his face. Jack asks him to stop it and Kirshner knocks out Jack by punching him in the face and then knocks over Williams too. Cornered by William, Kirshner calls Desmond for help in removing Jack's head so that he may live. Kirshner manages to get away and drives back to the basement in Kirshner's house, where he made and removed the gorilla's head. Before Kirshner can sedate Jack, Williams comes in and stops Kirshner. Williams then calls Desmond to get over to Kirshners' house as soon as possible. Desmond arrives with a nurse and an associate who find Kirshner detached head lying on the utensil table hooked up to a heart and lung machine which has his blood constantly pumping through the plastic tubes to keep him alive for a while. Kirshner calls to Desmond and begs for him to bring him another body.The film ends with Lila, Jack and Williams driving down the highway singing Oh Happy Day. They turn to each other and smile, they got rid of Kirshner and won the day."

In this first film of the Lone Wolf and Cub series, adapted from the manga by Kazuo Koike, we are told the story of the Lone Wolf and Cub's origin. Ogami Itto, the official Shogunate executioner, has been framed for disloyalty to the Shogunate by the Yagyu clan, against whom he now is waging a one-man war, along with his infant son, Daigoro.—Anonymous Set in Japan during an unspecific year of the Edo period, Ogami Itto, disgraced former executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin, to the shogun, wanders the countryside, pushing a baby cart with his 3-year-old son Daigoro inside. A banner hangs off his back. ""Ogami: Suiouryo technique"" (Child and expertise for rent), it says. His services are asked for in a most unexpected way, when an insane woman seizes Daigoro from the cart and proceeds to try and breastfeed the boy. Daigoro at first hesitates, but after stern look from his father, he proceeds to suckle the crazy woman's breast. The woman's mother then apologizes for her daughter's behavior and tries to give Itto money, but the stoic ronin refuses, saying his son was hungry anyway.As he walks in the rain, he remembers another rainy day several months earlier when his wife, Asami, was slain by three ninjas, ostensibly in revenge for Itto's execution of a boy daimyo in the opening scene, but it was really part of a complicated plot by the shogun's Inspector Bizen and the ""Shadow"" shogun of the Yagyu Clan to frame Itto for treason and take over the executioner's post. Itto takes on Bizen and his men killing them all.Now a wandering assassin for hire, Itto takes a job from a local chamberlain, to kill a rival and his gang of henchmen, who pose a threat to the chamberlain's lord. The chamberlain plans to test Itto, but a quick slash behind his back with his Dotanuki sword dispatches the chamberlain's two men. The targets are in a remote mountain village that is home to hot-spring spa pools.As Itto pushes the baby cart, and Daigoro observes scenes of nature, such as a mother dog suckling one puppy, and two children singing a song and bouncing a ball, Itto thinks back again to the time just after his wife was killed. He gave Daigoro a choice between a toy ball or the sword. If the child chose the ball, Itto would put him to death send him to be with his mother (a better place in his opinion). But the curious child reaches for the sword; he has chosen to take the path of the ronin with his father, to live like demons at the crossroads to hell.Flashing forward to the present, Itto reaches the hot-spring village. He finds that the rival chamberlain and his men have hired a band of ronins who have taken over the town and are raping, looting and pillaging. Itto is forced to give up his sword and take his place as a hostage in the village.The ronins discuss killing Itto, but then decide to let him live if he will have sex with the town's remaining prostitute while they watch. The prostitute refuses to have any part in it, but then she's threatened by one of the men, a knife-throwing expert, and in order to save the woman, Itto steps forward and disrobes, saying he will do the men's bidding with the woman.In yet another flashback it shows the dramatic beheading and blood-spurting scene in which Itto defeats one of Yagyu Retsudo's best swordsman, with the aid of a mirror on Daigoro's forehead to reflect the sun into the swordsman's eyes.And then there is the big showdown in the village, where it is revealed that the baby cart harbors some secrets various edged weapons, including a spear-like naginata, which Itto uses to take out the evil chamberlain's men, chopping one off at his ankles, leaving the bloody stumps of his feet still standing on the ground.One of the men has matchlock pistols, but Itto quickly upturns the baby cart, which is revealed to be armored underneath, and when the gunman's pistols are empty, Itto quickly leaps over the baby cart and brings his blade down on the man's forehead, splitting it two.After all the enemy ronin are dead, Itto leaves the village, and the prostitute hopes to follow, but Itto makes a motion to cut the ropes on the bridge leading to town, to stop her from following, for the journey he is on is one that is for only him and Daigoro to make."

Peter then produces an ancient document he claims to have found at his grandfather's house back in America.

Karl asks how can she know and Gretchen replies that she recognized him by his eyes, which ""burn like fire.""Realizing that any man who has the ability to rise from the dead might also have the power to alter his appearance, Karl, Peter and Eva go to the castle to confront Becker, who denies knowing what they are talking about. When he shows them the castle which is now restored, complete with dummies impaled on wooden stakes, the appearance gives the trio the impression that Becker really is the Baron. As Karl, Peter and Eva secretly debate what do to, Becker, no longer pretending to be crippled, rises from his wheelchair and advances towards them. Peter tries to reason with Becker, but he only knocks him out. Karl pulls out a gun and tries shooting at Becker/the Baron, but he keeps on advancing and also knocks Karl out. Eva holds up the magic amulet to try to use against him, but Becker only flings her aside against a wall, knocking her out.

Becker ties up Karl to a rack to be slowly stretched to death while he ties up Peter and begins torturing him with red-hot pokers. As Eva struggles to untie herself, she accidentally drops the amulet onto Fritz's dead body. A few drops of Eva's blood from her wounds lands on Fritz's body and the amulet itself. Suddenly, the Baron starts to suffer terrible pains as Fritz rises out of his coffin. The secret of how to destroy the Baron finally comes to light: the Barons victims all rise from their coffins, empowered by the magic amulet which is powered up with blood of the ones who raised him (either Eva or Peter). The undead victims whom include Fritz, Dortmundt, Christine, the doctor, grave digger, etc, all attack the Baron and literally rip him limb from limb. Eva manages to untie both Peter and Karl, and the wounded, blood-covered trio flee from the dungeon, and into Karl's car where they drive away from the castle, while the sounds of the Baron's dying screams echo into the night air."

The family become the housekeepers to a derelict country mansion in the charge of the solicitors. One day the children meet the spirits of two other children who died in the mansion nearly a hundred years previously. The children prepare a magic potion that allows them to travel backwards in time to the era of the ghost children. Will the children be able to help their new friends and what will happen to them if they do??—Mark Smith <msmith@osi.co.uk> Its 1917. A black wreath is put on the front door of a terraced house. Soon after, a mother with 2 children and a baby are seen moving out of the house.Its now a dark early Christmas evening and a smartly dressed old man is weaving his way through the market in Camden Town, noticeably shying away from a lit brazier. He knocks on the door of a dingy basement flat to which this family has now moved. He quickly explains he is not a rent collector but a partner in a firm of solicitors Blunden, Blunden, Claverton and a 4th member he cannot remember, who are seeking a reliable person to act as caretaker to a property in the firms charge. He is reluctant to go into details other than its a bit remote, but there is a rent-free caretakers cottage and the duties would be light. Saddled with little money other than a widow's pension and large debts, the mother (Mrs Allen) is tempted. The old man asks the 2 children Lucy (Lynn Frederick) and James (Garry Miller) if they would be afraid if they saw ghosts - say of children their age or an old man such as himself. He warns them they will hear tales about the house but when the time comes, they will know what to do.When the family accept his proposal, he visibly brightens and outside disappears mysteriously, saying to Lucy and James ""We 3 Kings of Orient are my dears"".Next day the family present themselves at the solicitors address. The clerk is puzzled as the job had not yet been advertised but shows Mrs Allen in to the partner Mr Claverton. Whilst waiting for their mother, Lucy and Tom see a picture of their visitor - Mr Blunden. The clerk retorts that is a picture of the current Mr Blunden's great grandfather who died 100 years ago and doubted if they had seen even the current Mr Blunden who was bedridden and senile.Mr Claverton delightedly offers the post to Mrs Allen and soon the family is travelling by bus to Langley Park, Buckinghamshire. The house proves to be derelict and overgrown and the cottage very sparse. They go to bed that night wondering what they have done.Next morning Lucy explores the house which has been extensively damaged. She hears childrens voices upstairs but is then startled by the presence of Elsie Tucker the daily cleaner. She mysteriously tells Lucy that the voices she hears are only kiddies.The following day the sun is shining and Lucy is happily picking flowers when out of a sudden mist she sees two figures approaching. She initially flees to find James but both return in time for the approach of two children dressed in old clothes. The ghost children, called Sara and Georgie, are pleased that Lucy and James have not run away and Sara recounts their story. Their parents had tragically died in a carriage accident in 1818. Their father's half brother Uncle Bertie, who lived in London, became their guardian as had the family solicitor Mr Blunden. Uncle Bertie, despite appearances, was short of money and often returned to Langley Park to steal and pawn the family silver. He subsequently married Bella, a simple chorus girl, and with her parents moved into Langley Park. He admitted to his new mother-in-law Mrs Wickens (Diana Dors) that he was hopelessly embarrassed financially. He explained that 10 year old Master Georgie was the only member of his family with money - £30,000 which was held in trust for him until he was 21. Uncle Bertie and Bella would only inherit this money if Georgie died before then.
Appalled at this revelation, Mrs Wickens assumed the role of housekeeper and sacked most of the staff at Langley Park as part of an economy drive. Mrs Wickens then got the idea that if the children caught their death of cold, her Bella would be in the money. She fed Sara and Georgie only on scraps and ordered the remaining servant - the timid Meakins - to make sure when she took their food up to their room that their window was left open during the cold nights. However Tom the gardeners son was very fond of Sara and used to climb up the drainpipe to their bedroom to provide them with newspaper to go under their bedding to help keep them warm and then close the window on his way downSome months passed until one night Sara and Georgie overheard the frustrated Mrs Wickens saying it was taking too long and a quick accident was now required. Sara burst in on Uncle Bertie to tell him and also wrote to Mr Blunden explaining their plight but neither believed her and ordered Mrs Wickens to prevent them running away at all costs by locking their window and bedroom door.That following night Georgie saw a message appearing on the window which said ""look in library"". Meakin had forgotten to lock the door so they crept down to the dusty old library. They saw an arrow drawn in the dust pointing to a book which contained a single sheet headed ""A charm to move the wheel of time"". It contained a recipe for which they had found the necessary herbs in the garden to concoct a potion, trying it first on the unsuspecting Mrs Wickens to make sure it wasn't poisonous. They used the potion to travel forward in time to try and get help and now Lucy and James are the first to stay and listen to their story. Their own potion is wearing off but before they leave Sara begs Lucy and James for their help and gives them the recipe for making it so they could travel back with her in future.The next day the children are in church when James gets Lucy to leave with him early to search the graveyard. Lucy refuses to help but James finds a grave for Sara and George Latimer dated April 21st 1818 ie 100 years ago tomorrow. They are startled by the sexton who says he's been there 40 years and knows the stories of each grave. He says a fire started in the library while the children lay in their beds and nobody could get to them to save them. He showed them another unmarked grave which his grandfather had told him belonged to the gardener's son, trying to save them by climbing up the drainpipe but he had fallen to his death.He said one of the guardians had left for London but his carriage had broken down. When he saw the flames he rode back to no avail saying over and over again that he was too late and subsequently died of a broken heart.Lucy and James now brew up the potion and meet Sara in the garden who says Georgie has been locked in the cellar. She begs them to return with her. Mr Blunden also appears and says he has a chance to put things right, promising them he will guard them and no harm will come to them.Lucy and James take the potion and travel back to 1818. They meet Tom who excitedly reckons they have come from America - the new world - where one day he hopes to go. They quickly realise no adults can see them, the exception being Bella who has the mind of a child. They spook her into getting her mother to release Georgie from the cellar.That night the 4 children eavesdrop on a dinner involving the Mr and Mrs Wickens, Uncle Bertie and Bella and Mr Blunden. As Mr Blunden leaves with Uncle Bertie, Sara and Georgie rush down to beg them to stay. The children are carted off by Mrs Wickens and the ghost of Mr Blunden appears to James, telling him to wait until the time comes. Then the ghost Mr Blunden goes down the stairs to be subsumed into the body of the living Mr Blunden.Lucy and James realise the nursery where Sara and Georgie sleep is above the library where the fire will start. They try unsuccessfully to get the keys off Mrs Wickens and rush outside to see Mr Wickens carrying a bundle of wood to the fire he has just started outside the library. Lucy waits for Tom who climbs the drainpipe to rescue Sara and Georgie, while James goes for an axe to break down the locked bedroom door. Mr Wickens sees Tom and tries to pull down the drainpipe but Lucy sufficiently distracts Mr Wickens to enable James to smash down the bedroom door and then smash the window locks to enable Tom to clamber in to safety. They find Sara and Georgie have been drugged but James leads Sara first and then Tom outside to Lucy and safety.James is afraid to go back in to the inferno to rescue Georgie but Mr Blunden appears back on horseback and promises they will go in together and he will protect James. They find Georgie and Mr Blunden pushes James and Georgie to safety before succumbing to the fire saying ""Thank you Thank you"". Georgie stumbles out of the house but theres no sign of James, leaving Lucy screaming for him and crying ""You're always too late Mr Blunden"".Her potion now wears off and shes back in the garden in her own time. She eventually finds an unconscious James lying outside the house and he is taken to his room.Next day being Sunday and with James still unconscious in bed, Lucy is in church when she suddenly decides to search the graveyard. This time there is only a gravestone for Mr Blunden with the inscription ""He gave his life to save the children in his care"" and dated April 21st 1818.As she wanders back home, her mother calls out that James is awake. Lucy tells James what she saw and they laugh with relief that the rescue had been successful.Sometime later a car pulls up and Clutterbuck gets out for a private meeting with their mother. Lucy and James gloomily say goodbye to the house and garden when their mother calls them. Clutterbuck says that Mr Blunden had suddenly got out of his sick bed the previous Thursday and ordered him to find the papers on the marriage of Miss Sara and Master Tom who are now revealed to be great-grandparents of their father. Sara Latimer had married a Tom Mortimer and they had sailed to America. As direct descendants, this makes James and Lucy legal owners of the house and cottage with an annual allowance of £500 for the rest of their lives.Clutterbuck leads them back to the car where he says all will be revealed. Inside is Mr Blunden and in reply to the childrens' question ""which one are you?"" says ""We 3 Kings of Orient are"" and gives them a wink.In front of their bemused mother, Lucy and James rush delightedly round the garden before the cast give their farewells."
"So Sweet, So Dead",1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069186/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A serial killer is on the loose. His victims are unfaithful wives and he always leaves compromising photographs at the crime scene. Inspector Capuana investigates serial murders where the victims of unfaithful wives were get killed as they were having sex with their husbands. A naked woman is found murdered and mutilated in a prosperous small province town in Southern Italy. But who is murdering her? After a while, the killer who wears black fedora, gloves, and trench coat starts photographing unfaithful wives as they start having sex with their lovers and also killing them.—c9rm9n In a prosperous small provincial town in Southern Italy, a naked woman is discovered murdered and mutilated. By her body are a number of photographs of her having sex with her lover, his face having been cut out. At the morgue, the chief pathologist suggests to the detective in charge of the case, Inspector Capuano, that the victim was killed almost instantly by a from an open blade razor to the neck, the subsequent blows being the result of a homicidal fury. A fellow police officer is of the opinion that, due to the circumstances surrounding the murder, especially the presence of the photographs, they are dealing with a maniac. Capuano considers having the pictures of the lover blown up so that all his physical details can be logged, but rejects the idea as impractical, not least because the victims husband is a general with very powerful political connections, meaning that any investigation must be handled very delicately. It is decided in the meantime to arrest members of the local criminal fraternity and determine any links, no matter how tenuous, with the case. Despite intensive questioning of suspects, no new information is yielded and so Capuano returns home to his wife. She is worried about the effect his latest investigation is having on him, while he complains about the wall of silence surrounding the case, meaning that he cannot perform his duties properly. He also believes that the killer is very likely to strike again. Out in the countryside, a woman cavorting with her lover is covertly photographed by a figure whose features are obscured by gloves, a hat and heavy overcoat. Later, at a secret hideaway, the couple finish having sex. The lover bemoans having to leave, but is reminded that the woman must also leave so that she can host a bridge game organised by her husband. Shortly after he leaves, and she begins to dress, the villa is plunged into darkness and an attack is launched by the figure seen photographing the couple earlier. The woman manages to escape her assailant and makes it onto a nearby beach, before succumbing and being hacked to death by a razor. The killer scatters photographs over her body. The next morning her boyfriend is reassured by his lawyer that he has nothing to fear from the resulting police investigation, since his face had been removed from the photos. He is advised that because of the victims powerful husband, the police will not pursue the case too forcefully and that he should continue with his life as normal. Detective Capulano and the pathologist discuss the connection between the two murders and mull over possible motives for the crimes, including jealousy and psychosis brought about by impotence or homosexual rage. The detective hears strange laughter coming from the morgue and is taken inside by the pathologist. There they encounter, Gastoni, the morgue assistant who takes a strong pride in his work as an embalmer and whose laughter is the result of perfectly restoring a corpses former beauty. As they leave, the assistant is heard muttering something about forgiveness for sins. The next day, the police mount a surveillance operation on the latest victims funeral, filming those present. Nothing untoward is found. The following day, in a beauty salon, some of the well-to-do women of the town discuss recent events, and are concerned as to who could be the next victim. At a meeting with the Police Commissioner, Capuano admits that he has hit a dead end with the investigation, since the only suspects that he has are considered untouchable because of their social standing and political connections. He decides to continue the case nevertheless, convinced that the killer will strike again and possibly make a mistake. He is warned to tread carefully by his superior. Meanwhile, in a wooded area, two lovers are photographed as they make love in a car"

Private Parts,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069124/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Young Cheryl moves into her estranged aunt Martha's rundown King Edward Hotel. One of its offbeat residents, disturbed photographer George, takes special interest in her. Cheryl begins suspecting that a resident was murdered. After a falling out with her roommate Judy Adams, a friend from home and her only real friend in Los Angeles, Cheryl Stratton, a teenaged runaway from Cleveland, searches out the Kingston Hotel, operated by her maternal Uncle Orville and Aunt Martha Atwood neither who she's ever met but of who she's only heard stories, for a place to stay temporarily instead of going home. In Cheryl finding the rundown hotel and her uncle long deceased, seemingly puritanical Aunt Martha reluctantly allows Cheryl to stay for a few days. Cheryl, who tries to be more grown up emotionally than she actually is, is ill-prepared for living at the Kingston, being scared not only of the things that go bump in the night, but those that go bump in the day as well. After meeting a few of the rather odd cast of long term residents of the hotel, Cheryl discovers that one of them anonymously has an interest in her and is thus watching her. In Cheryl secretly going on a search for her admirer, one-by-one she discovers some of the many secrets of the hotel, but not the full meaning behind those secrets. As she befriends fifteen year old Jeff from the neighborhood, he who has some history with former resident Alice Rogers, Cheryl, growing up quicker than Aunt Martha would like, may stumble onto the meaning of those secrets, but perhaps after it's too late.—Huggo When Cheryl and her roommate quarrel, Cheryl moves into her aunt's skid-row hotel in downtown L.A. rather than return home to Ohio. The lodgers are odd, Aunt Martha is a moralizer obsessed with funerals, murder is afoot, and the inexperienced and trusting Cheryl may be the next victim. She wants to be treated like a woman, and she's drawn to George, a handsome photographer who longs for human contact but sleeps with a water-inflated doll and spies on Cheryl as she bathes. Jeff, a neighborhood clerk, may be Cheryl's only ally in what she doesn't realize is a perilous residence haunted by family secrets. And, what happened to Alice, a model who used to have Cheryl's room?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Young Cheryl (pronounced ""CHAIR-ul"") is a runaway shacking up with her friend Judy. After Judy throws her out for watching her have sex with a guy, Cheryl packs her suitcase and takes off, along with Judy's wallet, and heads out into the sleaziest part of L.A. looking for her long-lost Aunt Martha's rundown hotel.Aunt Martha is a stout, homely woman with no tolerance for worldly ways. She insists that Cheryl wash ""that paint"" off before joining her for dinner, and lectures her on the evils of sex. Cheryl plays along for a place to stay, but she soon finds out that the hotel is full of loonies of all types. There's a gay priest who has a thing for male bodybuilders, a drunk guy who doesn't do anything except pass out in his room, and an old lady who wanders around looking for a girl named ""Alice"". Perhaps the weirdest tenant is a reclusive photographer named George, who shows his affection for Cheryl by spying on her through cracks in the wall, leaving her pornographic reading material in her room, and offering her fetish gear to wear for his amusement. Cheryl craves the attention, but she's not aware that people are being murdered in the hotel. A hunky stud who comes looking for Cheryl gets his head cut off with a machete, and the other tenants of the hotel start dropping off too. Cheryl's arrival seems to have set somebody off.Despite Aunt Martha's objections to men, Cheryl secretly begins dating Jeff, a young man who takes an interest in her. She must take great pains to ensure that Aunt Martha doesn't find out.George will not directly interact with Cheryl, choosing instead to spy on her and photograph her. In one of the film's most disturbing scenes, he engages in a most unusual sex act. He fills a vinyl blow-up doll with water, simulating a body as best he can. He dresses it like Cheryl and attaches a closeup photograph of Cheryl's face to the doll's head. He then gets in bed with it and simulates sex, climaxing with a bizarre moment: he draws a syringe of blood from his body and injects it into the doll.Judy shows up at the hotel looking for Cheryl and is murdered while nosing around in the basement. Eventually we learn that Alice, the girl who used to live at the hotel, has met with the same fate, after becoming the object of George's strange affection.Finally all is revealed. Aunt Martha is the one who has gone machete-happy, murdering anybody who interferes with her notion of morality, as well as anybody who will go near George, who is her child. Note that George is not her son--George is actually female, urged by Aunt Martha to avoid embracing feminine wiles. This explains George's need for a syringe to complete the sex act, as well as his unstable condition. It is also suggested that Aunt Martha is not really a woman herself, but rather a man who has adopted the opposite gender to avoid the moral pitfalls of being male.Before Cheryl can fall victim to George and Martha, Jeff and his father intervene with some rather inept policemen. The film concludes as we learn that Cheryl has taken over Aunt Martha's hotel. Has she also taken over Aunt Martha's strange outlook on life?"

He leaves the house in pursuit of Emil and Elizabeth.The villagers pull the bodies of the women from the lake. The priest appears with a burning cross and they march together to find the Baron, no longer afraid of demons in the woods. The baron pursues Emil and Elizabeth through the forest.

To save the patients from being ""abused"" further by the doctors, Wilfred freed the inmates. The crowd of lunatics walked into the house as a Christmas Eve dinner was being held and savagely murdered the doctors at the dinner table. As Wilfred went to the car, Marianne has slipped away, and the inmates, believing she was a doctor, killed her.Diane walks into the house and Jeffrey tells her that Wilfred is still alive, making the town believe he was dead by setting fire to a squatter he found at the house. Jeffrey also says that the sheriff, Tess, Towman, and Diane's father were all former inmates at the asylum and they had in fact founded the town while Wilfred had apparently been residing in an another asylum all these years. Mayor Adams arrives at the house and finds a corpse on the porch and screams. Diane gives Jeffery her revolver. As Mayor Adams walks inside, the two men shoot each other. At the top of the stairs, the killer, whom is finally revealed to be an 80-year-old Wilfred Butler, appears, telling Diane (whom he addresses as ""Marianne"") not to run away. A flashback shows a young Marianne running from her father. Diane goes to Jeffrey's side, grabs the revolver, and shoots Wilfred three times, who tumbles down the stairs... dead. Diane runs into a room and cries, leaving the house at daybreak.Nearly one year later, Diane takes one last look at the Butler mansion before it is destroyed by a bulldozer crew."

In the second film of the Lone Wolf and Cub series, Ogami Itto battles a group of female ninja in the employ of the Yagyu clan and must assassinate a traitor who plans to sell his clan's secrets to the Shogunate.—Anonymous In this second Lone Wolf and Cub movie, the disgraced former executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin to the shogun, Ogami Itto is now living rough on the land with his three-year-old son Daigoro, travelling the countryside as a hired killer. Pushing his son in a baby cart, he stops at a bathhouse looking for a room and a bath, and is eagerly welcomed in by a young woman. However, the manager of the house sees Itto as a dirty vagabond and scolds the young woman for letting him in the house. Overhearing this, Itto goes to the baby cart and retrieves a bundle and hands it to the manager for safe keeping it is 500 gold pieces, earned from a recent job. The manager's tone quickly changes, but when he tries to wash Daigoro's feet, the boy kicks water at the old man and tromps across the floor, leaving wet footprints.Itto's activities are being watched by the Kurokawa spy clan of Shinobi-class ninja, which have fallen in with Itto's nemesis, the Shadow Yagyu. They report on his activities to Sayaka, head of Akari Yagyu clan of female assassins. But the Kurokawa are unsure that the women are up to the task of killing Itto. Sayaka laughs confidently and tells the Kurokawas' leader to send their best man into the room. She then orders the man to try and exit the room. He tries to do so by grappling onto the ceiling, but the female assassins set upon him and make short work of him, hacking off his ears, fingers, arms and legs, leaving the man a writhing heap of just a torso and head before he is finally finished off.Itto, meanwhile, is hired by a clan that specializes in making indigo dye and has a secret process. One of the clan plans to sell out the secret to the shogun. Itto must kill him. The turncoat will be escorted by the three Hidari brothers, each a master of a deadly weapon; the iron claw, the flying mace, and a pair of armored gloves.As he travels to his job, Itto encounters three groups of female assassins of the Akari clan. The first group is disguised as an acrobat troupe that turns deadly as their gymnastic moves are combined with blades and turned against Itto. He then encounters a pair of women who with blades on their straw hats that they throw at Itto as if they are Frisbees. Finally, some women washing vegetables by the river turn out to be assassins and the daikons they are washing are wielded as weapons. Itto kills them all.Then he meets Sayaka, who catches him, his son and the baby cart in a steel net. Itto cuts his way out of the net and engages in a sword duel with her. He delivers what should be a disabling blow to her ankles, but the woman fighter jumps straight up out of her kimono to reveal a fishnet body suit and then runs away, bizarrely jogging backwards.Next, the Kurokawa clan are waiting for Itto, who puts together his naginata (disguised as railing on the baby cart) and gives the baby cart a shove toward the waiting enemies. Daigoro, still in the baby cart then activates blades in the axles of the cart, which cut off the feet of several men. The battle that ensues between Itto and the Kurokawas is fierce and Itto is injured before he kills them all.Weary from the endless fighting, Itto struggles along the road and eventually finds shelter in a shack. Daigoro, seeing that his father needs his help, must do what he can. Unable to carry water in his tiny hands, Daigoro carries water from the river in the only vessel available his mouth. He spits the few drops he could carry between his father's parched lips. For food, Daigoro finds some rice cakes given as an offering to a Buddha statue and takes them for his father, leaving his vest in exchange. Itto recovers and finds that his son is missing. Daigoro has been taken by the Kurokawa and Sayaka, tied up and suspended over a water well. If Itto attacks, they will let go of the rope and Daigoro will plunge to his death. Daigoro lets his sandal drop into the well, giving Itto a gauge of how deep it is. He then makes his move as the rope unspools, stopping it just in time.Sayaka watches silently and makes no move to engage the swordsman, realizing his technique far outstrips her own and perhaps also out of a sense of honor for the devotion of the father to his child.Itto then finds himself aboard a ship, carrying the three Hidari brothers. Itto is met by several other members of the indigo-dye clan, who try to kill the Hidaris but are bloodily rebuffed. The clan then sets the ship on fire in an attempt to kill the Hidaris, but the three killers escape. Itto tosses Daigoro and the baby cart into the water, the cart proves itself by floating.Sayaka has followed Itto onto the ship and in the water, she tries to kill him, but is disarmed. Itto, with Daigoro and Sayaka, find shelter, but they are cold. Itto disrobes himself and Daigoro, then turns on Sayaka, tearing off her clothes. But he does not mean to rape her. Instead, he is seeking to get her out of her cold, wet clothes and cling to her while nude. ""Three people are warmer than two,"" he explains. She thinks about taking his sword and killing him, but the cozy scene, with Daigoro sitting between them, playfully fondling her breast, makes her abandon the plan.The final showdown takes place on a vast area of sand dunes. The three Hidari brothers are at the head of a caravan of men carrying a palanquin with the indigo expert inside. The brother with the iron claw runs forward and thrusts his claw into the sand, which boils up with blood. There are men hiding in the sand. He digs his claw into the sand several times, each time creating a pool of blood and pulling up a hiding warrior by his head. The rest of the hidden men in the sand emerge and fight, but the Hidari brothers dispatch them all.Itto awaits, alone, at the top of a large dune. Each brother is dispatched in a high-pressure spray of blood, with the last brother dispatched in a lethal stroke along the throat, a cut that sprays blood in a fine mist, while making a sound like the ""howling of the wind"". The final slain Hidari brother comments such a fabled finishing stroke is referred to as ""Mogaribue"", and wishes he had heard the sound just once from the many people he has killed, but is instead hearing it from his own neck as his life slowly drains away.Itto approaches the palanquin with the traitorous indigo expert inside, finishing him off before gathering Daigoro and again setting off. The final scene shows them walking out of the desert and on a coastal trail, followed by Sayaka. Aware of her presence Itto stops the cart, looking straight ahead whilst holding out his dotanuki blade, as Sayaka wielding a katana is revealed behind him. Itto stands ominously still until he hears the sound of Sayaka dropping her sword; knowing that she can never defeat the master swordsman."

He leaves the field and goes to spend the night with a cinema cashier. After letting in an easy goal, experienced German goalkeeper Josef Bloch, believing it is offside, engages in a loud, fierce argument with the referee. Moments later he's sent off; he packs his things into a small bag and catches the first tram into Vienna to wander aimlessly from his cheap hotel to the local cinema. Before long, the polite cashier Gloria catches Josef's eye. She seems willing to hear him; can she prove a cathartic means of escape?—Nick Riganas Based on the 1970 novella by Peter Handke, Wim Wenders' The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, completed in 1972, documents the warped journey of athlete Josef Bloch (Arthur Brauss) as he slowly and unhysterically transitions from a professional football goalie to a peripatetic madman.In Vienna. After being ejected from a football match for missing a penalty kick, and angrily resisting what he sees as a bad call, Bloch takes a trolley to a cinema, where he buys his ticket from a female cashier (Erika Pluhar). He watches a Western. Later that night, he books a room, and lazily fiddles with a television on the front desk to catch a re-cap of the day's game. After checking in, he goes outdoors to make a phone call. Despite being told that the payphone isnt working, he tries to call someone anyway, only to fail. Weary, he then waits outside the same cinema he visited earlier in the day, and watches the female cashier get into a car and drive off. Back at the hotel, he asks for a paper. Not having any, the hotel clerk offers him a crime novel instead, but Bloch has walked away by the time he returns with the text. Bloch goes to bed.At breakfast the next morning, he scans the local newspaper, searching for the football game results. He takes a brief walk and enters a sports bar; Roy Orbison's ""Dream Baby"" is blaring from a jukebox, and many pictures of footballers adorn the walls. While looking at the pictures, Bloch strikes up a conversation with a girl standing beside him, and tells her of a former teammate who disappeared after moving to play football in the United States. The two go walking to the girl's apartment building and, while riding the elevator to her room, he touches her suggestively. After a time, they are on the street once more, where they part. Bloch continues his search for the football match results, taking in street attractions and merchant booths along the way. While walking through a dark alley, he is the victim of an attempted mugging; one stopped short by the appearance of passers-by. Shaken, Bloch continues on his way through town, ultimately arriving at the same cinema he visited earlier. He chats briefly with the same female cashier, gets a ticket for a seat with extra legroom, and watches a movie about counterfeiters.After the movie, he stands in a dark alley adjacent to the theater, waiting once more for the cashier to leave. This time, he follows the girl onto a bus, first sitting behind her before boldly moving to her front. Though she appears not to notice him at first, when both get off at the same spot, she allows him to accompany her to her residence, where they then have sex. The next morning, Bloch is the first up. He opens her blinds, and sees (and hears) that she lives near an airfield. While she sleeps, Bloch takes a shower, his face betokening a mix of relaxation and disturbed contemplation. Bloch's shower wakes the girl who, over breakfast preparations, tells Bloch of a recurring dream of hers in which she wears a dress made of money that breaks out into flames at odd intervals. After switching on some Top-40 rock music, she prepares to run errands; Bloch requests that she bring him back a paper. While eating breakfast, formal introductions are made: Josef Bloch, professional goalkeeper; and Gloria, cinema cashier. Gloria remarks that she thought Bloch a boxer first, due to his many bruises. They continue to talk, with Gloria relating a tale of watching a football match with a former beau, and Bloch recalling a flub made during a game, along with his football-related travels to South America and the United States. He takes an interest in one of the postcards Gloria has posted by her mirror. Laid out on her bed, she says she's a collector. Bloch drops the postcard and joins her, stiffly reacting to the playful strangling motions she directs his way with one of her ropes. Suddenly, Bloch reaches out and chokes Gloria dead.We find him next sprawled out on Gloria's carpet, groggy. Aware of what he has done, Bloch wipes every utensil and every surface free of his fingerprints, and swipes the American currency lying on Gloria's table. He then returns to the hotel from two nights ago. After paying the 300 shilling bill, Bloch curiously fakes punching the hotel clerk before walking away. He enters the cinema once more, is found to be sleeping in the seats and is asked to leave. Angrily, Bloch knocks the concessionaire's flashlight from his hands and storms away. The concessionaire files a complaint and, when questioned later by the local police, Bloch reluctantly professes to not intending to knock the flashlight away, saying it was just a reflex. Later, Bloch boards a bus and, in the process of sitting down beside an old woman (Rosl Dorena), American coins spill out of his jacket. When the woman looks at him askance, Bloch casually passes off the coins as money left over from his time spent playing football in the United States. During a long bus ride through the countryside, Bloch completes a crossword puzzle and temporarily disembarks at a country bar, where he plays one record on its jukebox before re-boarding the bus. He rides until arriving at the bus terminus, listening to American rock n roll on his pocket radio. Once off the bus, Bloch finds a free room at a hotel. While being shown to his room (upstairs, adjacent to a bowling alley), Bloch asks the hotel girl if she knows an acquaintance of his, one Hertha Gabler (Kai Fischer). The girl replies to the affirmative, saying Gabler leases the Border Inn by the customs border. The next morning, the townspeople speak of a local handicapped boy who has been missing for three days. Bloch takes a newspaper, and finds that the mysterious murder of a female cinema cashier is front page news. He quickly hides the page, and reads the story of the missing cripple. He then leaves the hotel, and enquires for directions to the Border Inn.After receiving very detailed directions from two women in a store. Bloch has one of them mend his jacket; he also buys shirts. Outside, a cop car drives by, and Bloch becomes visibly worried. He leaves town, and walks on the roadside until he reaches the Border Inn. When he arrives, he is informed by the Inn's female employee that Gabler is sleeping; he orders a beer, establishes that he knew Gabler in days past, and listens as the employee tells him of a man from out of town who tried to force himself on Gabler under the guise of wanting to dig a well, and wanting to see the Inn's cellar. While waiting for Gabler, Bloch finds an unplugged jukebox, activates it, and plays more '50s rock. When Gabler arrives, she says that she saw his name in the paper recently. He's taking a break from the game, he says. She talks about the make-up she dons when out at night, and how it covers her up well. Bloch says he'd know her still by her blue eyes. Before leaving, he helps Gabler move furniture, and says hell stop by again in the morning. While walking by a one-room schoolhouse, Bloch comes upon an old man chopping wood. The man criticizes the local school system, and bemoans how kids today cant speak one proper, original sentence; it's all rote memorization, he argues. The next morning, Bloch mails a postcard at Gabler's; while entering Gabler's place, he grimaces at the weird smell outside. Gabler says one of the neighbors just died. Bloch asks of border guards, rent, and what number Gabler starts with when counting. He says he doesn't count the ones anymore, and adds that he almost got run over this morning while crossing the street for he only saw the second car. Gabler's young daughter, who has been easily frightened ever since the cellar incident, runs in and complains about the dead flies the neighborhood boys have placed under her pillow. Gabler explains to Bloch that the neighborhood boys are staying over until the body is buried, and shoos her girl away. After asking how country people do their loving, Bloch remarks that he saw a woman with a spot of blood on her dress two days back.The next morning at the hotel, Bloch strikes up a conversation with some locals who are interested in the appraisal of items. Bloch then gets a haircut, telling the two women in the shop (Monika Poschl, Sybille Danzer) that he places more trust in male hairdressers. The two women laugh, and say that they had bet on him being either a goalie or a boxer, and both admit to enjoying standing behind goalies and making them nervous. Bloch says he wouldn't be made nervous so easily. He then wanders through the countryside, passing the time staring into a stream. Later, after telling his host at the hotel that he'll pay for the room in the evening, he attends a football practice and exercises behind the goalie, shadowing his movements. Back at the hotel, he wakes up during the night and barfs into his sink. When he arrives late to breakfast the next morning, he admits to the hotel girl that he likes the place.Nevertheless, he becomes very much concerned by a headline in the paper announcing that the cripple boy was found dead in the same stream he stared at the day before. He tries phoning a Mr. Schneider, asks of a football practice, has a difficult time comprehending what is said to him, and is then disconnected. Later, in a meat shop, Bloch laughs with the butcher at the news that the cripple boy's bloated body was mistaken for a mattress, and then returns to the stream. In the evening, he meets the same hairdresser girls from a day before, and tells them of a dream he had. Bloch then wanders into a bus stop bar, meets some guys, and follows them to the cinema. They then embark for a small club, where Bloch meets up with Gabler, and listens to a jukebox spinning '50s hits. He drinks, and starts to play cards with a group of men. Just as the tune ""Gloria"" plays, Bloch, who is blankly staring at his hand of cards, tosses his chips in a guy's face and proceeds to fight him outside, where it is raining steadily. Bloch gets beaten up badly, and is left out in the rain. He stumbles back inside, drinks, and dances wearily with Gabler before returning with her to the Border Inn. There, they discuss diverse things until Gabler begins to rail on him for his slovenliness and messiness. Before the situation becomes any more intense, a border official (Bert Fortell) pops in and requests an umbrella for his walk home. Gabler assents, and Bloch volunteers to accompany the man on his way home. During the trek, the border officer shares with Bloch what it is like to be in law enforcement, how the crime rate in town has declined since the mining of the frontier, and how keen observations and swift reactions to movements are key to successfully catching a crook. Once home, the border officer offers Bloch a drink. He declines and returns to the hotel. Bloch listens to his pocket radio.In the morning, on the way down to breakfast, Bloch encounters a man and asks of the reading habits of the locals. He learns that the guests like to read the newspaper, and that the townsfolk usually read magazines. In the dining room, the hotel girl hands Bloch a paper. On the front page, there is a police sketch which bears great resemblance to him. He wanders away from the hotel, spooked. While waiting at a nearby bus stop, Bloch reads a headline in bold: ""Hot Clue in Gloria T. Mystery?"" When the bus comes, he stares at the driver, and does not board. Instead, he heads to the local football field and observes the ongoing match. While watching, he shares his experiences and his feelings on the game with a salesman (Michael Toost) sitting beside him. Bloch reflects on how hard it is to focus on anything but the ball during a game, and how strange it is to see a goalie running around without the ball involved. During a penalty kick, Bloch tells the salesman of the anxiety which runs through a goalie's head when not knowing what corner the ball will come to, and what the kicker is aiming at. Ultimately, the goalie blocks the ball, and the match continues. Bloch and the salesman watch in silence.FINIS"
They Only Kill Their Masters,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069371/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"California small town police chief investigates a suspicious death involving the victim's own dog that presumably killed its owner. An enigmatic young woman has been murdered in a small California coast town. The investigation by the local sheriff uncovers a complex web of relationships centering on the victim; the scattered trail of evidence ranges from a mysterious photograph to the victim's own dog. During the investigation, the sheriff meets and becomes romantically involved with a woman whose connection to the murder is ambiguous.—Elisabeth Pruitt <foosi@global.california.com> Off the shores of the beach-front town of Eden Landing, California, the dead body of thirty-nine year old divorcée Jenny Campbell is found washed up on the beach, hovered over by her pet Doberman, Murphy. Because of the marks on her body, the initial belief is that Murphy mauled her to death. About one week after the fact, Police Chief Abel Marsh, who had been in Los Angeles at the time of the body being found, takes over the investigation. He has to be resourceful as the detachment is cash-strapped. From the autopsy, he finds that she didn't die from being mauled by Murphy - who was actually trying to pull her out of the water - but by drowning in fresh water made to resemble salt water. So the investigation turns to one of murder. The autopsy also uncovers that she was pregnant, which is a seeming dichotomy to the information that Abel receives from her estranged ex-husband that she was a lesbian, the reason for their divorce. He finds from veterinarian Dr. Warren Watkins that Murphy is a well-trained animal, who was initially court ordered put down when the belief was that he killed his master. Through the investigation, Abel begins a relationship with veterinary nurse Kate Bingham, a divorcée recently arrived from New York City. Although not a dog person, Abel, with Kate's assistance, ends up taking care of Murphy. Abel believes Murphy and a photo he finds in Jenny's house are the keys to finding Jenny's murderer. An obstacle in Abel finding the killer is Sheriff Daniel Streeter, who wants to take over the investigation and who seems often to work at cross-purposes to Abel.—Huggo The dead body of thirty-nine year old Jenny Campbell (Lee Pulford) is in the surf on the beach outside her isolated house in the ocean-front community of Eden Landing, California. By the wounds, it looks as if her Doberman, who is snarling as he hovers over her body, mauled her to death, specifically by going for her throat.This death is the biggest case for Eden Landing police chief, forty-year-old Abel Marsh (James Garner) upon his return from a week-long vacation in Los Angeles, where, rumor has it, he went ""to get some"" as the running gag is that there are no good-looking, available women in Eden Landing. Most of the time, Abel only has to worry about his department doing whatever little actual police work they have on no budget, which forces them all to use the two police cruisers on a rotating basis for their collective personal business. Meanwhile, their regional county sheriff, Captain Daniel Streeter (Harry Guardino), seemingly gets whatever he wants. Abel's first order of business on this case is to serve the notice to put down the Doberman, who is currently being housed at the professional compound of Abel's casual friend, veterinarian Dr. Warren G. Watkins (Hal Holbrook). This is a task which Abel is not looking forward to, if only because he doesn't like dogs. At the vet's office, he meets Warren's beautiful new nurse, thirty-year-old Kate Bingham (Katharine Ross), from whom he learns that the dog, named Murphy (Hans), is very well trained, but that there are documented cases of Dobermans killing their masters in such a manner. Warren further confirms that they can put Murphy down using a humane method of drugs, specifically sodium pentobarbital. The court order is rescinded, and the case turns into a double murder investigation when Abel learns from the coroner's office that Jenny died from drowning - in fresh water made to resemble salt water - and that Jenny was three months pregnant when killed. Murphy's actions at the beach were efforts to pull her out of the ocean and protect her body.During Abel's initial search through Jenny's home for clues, the house which looks as if a party had just been held in it, he seems most interested in the smell of the bathtub and a bottle of Cromarty, a single malt scotch in the liquor cabinet. He takes the bottle with him to consume himself at the diner owned by his friend Ernie (Arthur O'Connell), and he later learns Cromarty is not stocked at the local liquor store. He hears a noise sounding like someone else is in the house. He is only able to catch a glimpse of someone running away from the scene.At a private club, Abel speaks to Jenny's ex-husband, wealthy non-local businessman Lee Campbell (Peter Lawford), who has an alibi for the time of the murder. Campbell tells Abel that Murphy was initially his, that the house belongs to him, and that he was letting Jenny use it after their divorce, which was the last time he saw her alive. Also, that he paid for, but did not attend, the funeral because the reason for their divorce was that she left him for another woman. He notices that Campbell is drinking Cromarty. As such, he returns to Ernie's to retrieve the bottle he took from Jenny's house. Back at Jenny's house, he knows that beneath the mess, someone was careful to remove all incriminating evidence of the murder. However, he does find something that intrigues him: a photograph, taken from the house toward the beach, of a nude man and woman running toward the surf holding hands. He can't tell the identity of either person. As she has a science background, Abel calls Kate to the house, and she is able to identify the smell in the bathtub as a disinfectant masked by deodorant, to hide the fact of where the drowning probably took place. He takes the opportunity to learn about Kate - that she is from New York where she was running away from a bad marriage. Unable to find a home for Murphy, Kate convinces Abel to take him. The two make plans for a date. After their dinner date at Abel's house, she spends the night. This date is the beginning of their relationship.Abel learns from Campbell that the woman in the photograph is not Jenny, that he does not know who either person is, and that Jenny liked to take photographs of her friends in compromising positions. Although the house used to be full of such photos, this is the only one Abel found.Abel fills Streeter in on the case at Streeter's request, although Abel tells him they don't need the help of the sheriff's office. Streeter implies that it is his business because if things go sour on the investigation, he gets the blame.As Abel heads to Jenny's house late one evening, he sees a Chevy sedan speeding away in the opposite direction on the only road leading to and from the house. Arriving at the house, he sees that it is engulfed in flames. He notices Campbell's sports car on the scene. Fighting the flames, Abel enters the house and sees a man fleeing, who manages to escape in the sports car, while Abel's car is now disabled from a slashed tire and cut cord to the police radio. He is able to telephone the fire department from the house, as the part of the house where the telephone is located is not yet touched by the fire. While in the house, he sees an unconscious body inside. He is able to get the body out, that being Campbell himself, meaning that the persons fleeing, both in the Chevy and Campbell's sports car, were not Campbell. By the time the fire department, ambulance, and police arrive, who all were delayed as the perpetrator was able to place a roadblock, the house is totally destroyed, and Campbell is dead.As Abel and Kate are in bed later that night, Murphy enters the bedroom and begins to snarl, as if he is ready to attack, which is the first time he's done such since either has known him. They are both scared, but Kate, using what she knows as his training, is eventually able to get Murphy back to a normal state. Although able to subdue him, she does not know what set him off. Because of Murphy's volatile behavior, Abel wants Kate to take Murphy back to Warren's office.Streeter and his men come storming into town, he telling Abel that he is taking over the investigation. A comment by Streeter before he leaves makes Abel wonder how Kate knew Murphy's name, as Warren's office had never treated him before. This question also makes Abel think that the woman in the photograph is Kate. Confronting Kate at her apartment, Abel manhandles her as her answers to his question about Murphy aren't as he would like. Thinking about it, Kate remembers that Warren was the one who mentioned the dog's name to her, as he was the one who got the call to pick up the dog from the beach. Later, Abel heads to Warren's office, where he clandestinely watches Warren in the pen with Murphy, training him to attack. As Abel confronts Warren, Warren tries to dismiss what he was doing a friendly play with Murphy. Abel then arrests him for the murder of Jenny, her ex-husband, and his own unborn child. The one piece of the puzzle Abel has not yet figured out is the identity of the third party, the woman in the photograph who was the third in Warren and Jenny's ménage-a-trois. Just then, a patient (Norma Connolly) arrives with her dog. Warren asks if he can attend to this emergency, which was the reason he came to the office early. Abel allows him as much. Warren gets Abel to hold onto the dog, to whom he will give an injection to reduce the swelling in the dog's prostate. Instead, Warren stabs Abel with the needle and runs off. A car chase ensues, with Abel able to radio for help. The primary question's are what was in the injection and will Abel be either conscious or alive long enough from that injection to catch Warren. Abel does catch up to Warren, but passes out before he can do anything. Warren drives off. One of Abel's officers, John (Christopher Connolly), arrives to take Abel to the hospital.When Abel awakens in the hospital, he learns from Streeter that he was injected with sodium pentobarbital, and that the dose would have killed a large dog. Based on information from John, Streeter also mentions that they have picked up Kate as the co-murderer, but Abel responds that she is not the other person they are looking for. Later that night, Abel, still in a groggy state, sneaks out of the hospital and heads to Kate's. Seeing him, Kate is concerned for him. He, in turn, is unable to say anything to her, and he walks off.Streeter and his men are unable to locate Warren, whose office is being packed up on the directive of an unknown woman. Warren's boat is also missing from the harbor. They assume he has sailed away to parts unknown. But upon questioning Streeter, Abel and John realize that what Warren has done is hide out in his own house in town, and his wife (June Allyson) was able to provide Streeter with all the right answers.The moving company makes delivery of Warren's office items to his house. Across the street, Streeter, his team, and Abel's team are on surveillance. In Warren's house, Abel appears from behind a door in the room where the delivery has just been made to confront Warren. Abel threatens to kill Warren, who states that he has killed no one. Abel is able to open the blinds as a signal to the surveillance team, before he takes Warren at gunpoint down into the kitchen, where Warren's wife is preparing lunch. As Abel and Warren are walking down the stairs, Abel is hit over the head from behind by an unknown assailant. Warren rushes out of the house, and the entire surveillance team pursues him. Streeter orders him to stop, which he doesn't. As Abel emerges onto the street, he shouts at Streeter to not shoot Warren, which Streeter does anyway. He shoots Warren dead. Abel then tells him that Warren killed no one. Mrs. Watkins then rushes out from the house to her dead husband. Abel confronts Mrs. Watkins as the murderer. Despite Abel's accusations of her and Jenny's affair, she calls Jenny a bitch, as a person whose love was not pure, in the sense that it was not solely in her direction as she wanted, but rather wanting to bring Warren in as the third, before a fourth and fifth in Jenny's pursuit of free love. The pregnancy was the last straw as a sign of how she was not truly a part of Jenny's life. She is handcuffed and taken away.As Abel is alone at the police station surveying the broken equipment received as part of the request from their latest budget, Kate arrives, announcing that she is leaving town since she is out of a job. Kate mentions that she never thought Warren a murderer, which he wasn't. He was just a man in love with his wife, who cleaned up after her messes. Abel then confesses that he thought, if only for a second, that it was Kate in the photograph. Kate departs for good, leaving Abel alone with Murphy. Abel looks out the window as Kate gets in a taxi that drives away. Abel gets on the police radio to Streeter asking for a favor: to tell him where the taxi, which will be passing by his area, is going."

A gang of thieves plan to make their fortune by stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from Finisham maternity hospital. They assume disguises and infiltrate the hospital, but everything doesn't go according to plan. (Of course!) The hypochondriac consultant Sir Bernard Cutting, Matron, and the doctors and nurses at Finisham have a habit of getting in the way.—Simon N. McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> The last of four ""Carry On"" medical movies centres on the plan by a group of criminals to steal some contraceptive pills from the hospital which involves one of them (Cyril) dressing as a nurse. In this film, it is Sir Bernard (Williams) who is after Matron and not the other way around. With a great but slight appearance by Charles Hawtrey as Dr. Goode, and funny cameo appearances by Joan Sims and Kenneth Connor, the subplots in the film come together at the end when the criminals decide that tonight's the night.—Graeme Huggan <hia95gh@sheffield.ac.uk> Sid Carter (Sid James) is the cunning head of a criminal gang that includes the long-haired drip Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), the cheeky Freddy (Bill Maynard) and Sid's honest son, Cyril (Kenneth Cope), who does not want to live a life of crime but is emotionally blackmailed by his father into going along with his scheme to rob Finisham Maternity Hospital for its stock of contraceptive pills.Cyril reluctantly disguises himself as a new nurse to case the hospital and the booty, however he is assumed to be one of a batch of new student nurses who have just arrived, and is assigned the same room as the shapely, blonde nurse, Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Unfortunately for Cyril, he also catches the eye of the hospital Lothario, Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott.). Dr Prodd is infamous for ogling the student nurses & is under constant watch from the matron who wants to save the nurses from Dr Prodd's unwanted advances.Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), the hypochondriac registrar of the hospital, is convinced he's undergoing a sex change, however when he consults the nutty Dr F.A. Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Goode dishes out psychiatric Mumbo Jumbo, stating that Cutting merely wants to prove his manhood, and Cutting realizes he is in love with Matron (Hattie Jacques).
Matron, on the other hand, has more than enough to contend with on the wards, with the gluttonous Mrs Tidey (Joan Sims) who seems more interested in eating than producing a baby and her long-suffering British Rail worker husband (Kenneth Connor) who continually hangs around the waiting room.
When Cyril goes back to Prodd's room to get a map of the hospital, Prodd attempts to get intimate, only to be knocked across the room. Prodd and Cyril are called out on an emergency when lovely film star Jane Darling (Valerie Leon) begins to have her baby, but as Cyril knocks Prodd out in the ambulance, he is forced to deal with the actress's triplets being born. However, Jane Darling is delighted with Cyril, and hails ""the nurse"" a heroine for her efforts, bringing fame to the hospital.

Bernard finds Dr Goode hiding inside the Matron's cupboard. Dr Goode & Matron had a weekly appointment to watch a TV serial together in her room, & Matron had hidden Dr Goode, when she heard Dr Bernard coming to her room.

The criminal gang don disguises - Sid dresses as the foreign ""Dr Zhivago"" and Ernie as a heavily expectant mum. They enter the hospital citing an emergency delivery. Sid & Freddy have to enter the Matron's room to retrieve the keys to the basement medical store. But they are found by Dr Bernard, who again thinks that Matron is having an affair & is a sex fiend. The Matron convinces Dr Bernard that the men are suspicious & orders the doors to the hospital locked. Sid & co have stolen the pills, but can't escape.The medical hierarchy's threat to call the police is halted when Sid reveals the heroine of the day is a man, and the hospital realize they would suffer nationwide humiliation if anyone found out.

Squabbling Sharma family has a dubious reputation of not having any cook last there for more than a few months. Word spreads out about this family to such an extent that no person wants to be employed as a cook in this household, ironically named Shanti Nivas (""Abode of Peace""). Then one day a young man named Raghu offers to work as a cook and he is hired. Raghu quickly gets a grip on his job and on each of the family members, and soon their internal squabbles and arguments come to an end. And then the Sharmas find that Raghu might have been too good to be true.—Soumitra The film starts by the introduction of Shanti Niwas and its residents by Amitabh Bachchan, who is the narrator here. He points out that Shanti Niwas is a pot of ironies: Even though its name means ""Home of Peace"", there is no peace here. The home, which houses the Sharma family, has members who hate each other for reasons unknown. Even a servant cannot withstand the Sharmas for more than a month.
Ramnath Sharma (Munna) (A. K. Hangal) & wife Seeta Sharma (Badi Maa) (Durga Khote); younger bro Kashi (Kali Bannerjee) & wife Shobha Sharma (Choti Maa) (Usha Kiran); youngest bro Vishwanath Sharma (Bubbu) (Asrani); Krishna (Jaya Bhaduri) is the recluse daughter of Daduji's dead son and daughter-in-law.
Ramnath drinks at night.. Shobha wants to live separately, but Kashi thinks the minute they leave the house Daduji will give all wealth to Ramnath. Ramnath's daughter Meeta is learning to dance and Krishna secretly watches her. Krishna is secretly dating a boy named Arun, who also tutors her.Ramnath is in trouble at work for coming in late daily (all morning goes in sorting out daily family and household quarrels and issues)..After every month, the search for a new servant has to start. Then, suddenly a servant named Raghu (Rajesh Khanna) comes in. Even though nobody remembers asking for Raghu, they hire him. But Raghu has his own surprises in store for them. Gradually, the whole home comes to know that Raghu is not only an accomplished chef, but also an expert singer and dancer.
Raghu tells his masters that he worked for reputed veterans of given fields, who taught him something or the other. Gradually, many aces start falling out of his sleeves, causing the Sharmas to develop an attraction to him. Even Daduji Shivnath (Harindranath Chattopadhyay), the disgruntled patriarch of the family, develops love for Raghu. Ramnath's performance at work improves and he gets a raise and 3 yr extension of service. Raghu celebrates the little things in the house and encourages family members to help in daily tasks and sharing the little moments. ""Apna Kaam Tow Sabhi Karte Hain, Kabhi Doosron Ka Kaam Karne Ki Khushi Bhi Leejiye)The family puts so much trust in Raghu that they even unwittingly show him the box containing the family jewels.
Krishna loves to dance as well. On learning this, Raghu tutors her and brings her talents to the fore. Krishna wins the dance competition that Meeta is also participating. He also helps in clearing up the misunderstandings and calling truces between the family members (between Ramnath and Kashi) (between Badi ma and Choti Ma) (by getting them to share their past stories and reminding them how much they love each other). Daduji cannot help but think that Raghu is actually a savior sent by god. Meanwhile, nobody notices that Raghu is suspiciously eyeing the jewel box the whole time.Meanwhile, Raghu learns that Krishna loves Arun, but the Sharmas are strictly against the union of Krishna with him (Arun was kicked out of the house when Krishna one day took him up to her room when Daduji was asleep. Badi Ma thought they were doing immoral stuff in her room). Arun also loves Krishna, but is helpless before Krishna's relatives as well. Amongst all the tangle, Raghu suddenly disappears. The Sharmas are also aghast to know that the box is missing as well.
It does not take the Sharmas long to put two and two together. At the same time, Arun shows up. He explains that he saw Raghu in a suspicious condition with the box. When he asked Raghu about the box, Raghu tried to run away. He tried to stop Raghu, even beat him up (the boy is a wrestler), but Raghu somehow managed to escape.Stunned by this unexpected turn of events, the attitude of Sharmas towards Arun changes and they agree to get him married with Krishna out of gratitude. Krishna, however, refuses to buy the story. When the Sharmas start abusing Raghu, Krishna's lover cannot take it anymore and tells them what really happened.
He tells them that he met Raghu at his own wrestling ground. He had a little friendly match with Raghu, where he suffered minor injuries from Raghu. He saw the box and asked Raghu about it. Raghu said that the box was the real reason he came there. Raghu had asked him to take the box to the Sharmas and tell them that Raghu had stolen it so that Krishna's lover can get back his place in the house.
Meanwhile, Krishna sees Raghu outside the house and asks him why did he do all this. Raghu told her that his real name was professor Prabhakar, but he took the fake name of Raghu. He had seen many families like the Sharmas which were on the brink of breaking up and hence decided to use his knowledge to stop this.
Raghu tells her that this is his life's mission and now he has to go. The film ends with a scene of him traveling to a new destination and narration from Amitabh Bachchan that ""Raghu is going to a new home. Let's hope it is not yours.""
The movie was a hit. It was the 8th highest-grossing film of the year."

Willy, Richard, and Lionel, three blue-collar friends from Montreal East, leave the city and travel to the countryside for a weekend of hunting. Richard's wife forces him to bring along his young son, Michel.

The group spends their first night at a motel bar and Michel silently observes as the adults get drunk, try to outdo each other with insults, and sexually harass the waitresses at the bar. It becomes apparent to him that Willy is not up to trip; he is overweight and clings to his glory days of the past. Michel must also watch as his father conducts an affair with a waitress. When the hunt finally begins, Michel contemplates the imposed belief that a man ought to be a womanizing drinker who's good with a gun.

Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart to Hades,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068817/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ogami Itto volunteers to be tortured by the yakuza to save a prostitute and is hired by their leader to kill an evil chamberlain. The third instalment of the 'Lone Wolf & Cub' film series sees Ogami Itto and his son; Daigoro, face with with a series of foes; new and old, as they wander across feudal Japan. From despicable ravaging ronin, to the honourable yet dangerous Bohachimono gang, and not to mention the allies and agents of the dreaded Yagyu Clan.—samrussell-82620 In this third 'Lone Wolf and Cub' movie, Ogami Itto, the disgraced former shogun's executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin, is travelling by river on a boat with his young son Daigoro floating behind in the baby cart. A young woman at the front of the boat, clearly distraught for some reason, accidentally drops a bundle into the water, which Daigoro retrieves.Itto, meanwhile, draws his sword part way and notices in the reflection on the blade that some bamboo reeds are also trailing the boat. Itto is being followed by operatives of his mortal enemy, the Yagyu Clan; a constant threat that he can never ignore. Later, as Daigoro is relieving himself in a bamboo glade, Itto slices some bamboo stalks, causing some ninja assasins to fall from their perch.According to the voice-over narrator, this is a time in the Edo period in Japan when there are ronin, or at the very least a low-class of samurai termed ""watari-kashi""; small bands of fighters who move from job to job, working from one ""daimyo"" (feud lord) to the next, depending on who's hiring.A group of four watari-kashi are idling along the road. Hot and bored, they spy an attractive young woman and her mother being escorted by a servant. Three of them run off to take advantage, but one of the band Kanbei, the more honorable of the four remains uninterested. The three knock the escort unconscious and proceed to rape the two women. The servant regains consciousness and is furious when he sees the triad violating his mistresses. He attempts to beat them with his bamboo pole, but is slain by Kanbei, who then also slays the two women to silence them. Kanbei then makes his three companions draw straws, saying the one unfortunate enough to draw the short straw will be killed to take the blame for the rapes and murders.Itto happens along this grim scene just as Kanbei is slaying the watari-kashi who drew the short straw. Itto kills the other two rapists when they attempt to attack him. Kanbei recognizes Itto and requests a duel. Itto accepts and they prepare, but at the last second Itto re-sheathes his sword and calls it a draw, leaving Kanbei to ponder his fate alone. ""You are a true warrior,"" Itto says, ""One I hope lives on.""At an inn, it turns out that the young woman from the boat is to be sold into prostitution. Her pimp tries to have his way with her, but she bites off his tongue, spitting the bloody appendage onto the floor. The pimp dies from the injury.The girl seeks refuge in Itto's room, who steps in to protect her from the local police. But then the town's real authorities show up which are the local Yakuza, led by a young woman named Torizo. Some verbal sparring begins as Itto defends the girl against Torizo's threats. After Torizo pulls out a pistol and fires at shot at Itto's feet to indimidate him into surrendering the girl, Itto agrees to act as a substitute for the young woman and undergo ""buri-buri"", a form of torture that involves the subject being hogtied and hung in the air and repeatedly dunked headfirst into a tub of water. The subject is then beaten to unconsciousness by men wielding thick rattan canes and shouting ""buri-buri"". Itto endures the torture with his typical stoicism. This frees the young woman from having to work as a prostitute.Itto, still with a debt to pay for the death of the pimp, agrees to take on an assassination for Torizo and her father, a one-armed man that Itto is acquainted with from his past life as the shogun's executioner - acting as second during the execution of a daimyo who, fear-stricken, struggled dishonourably; Torizo's father had restrained the daimyo, sacrificing his arm to Itto's killing stroke.The target is a corrupt district deputy. Initially Itto is to face the deputy's personal bodyguards, one of whom is a sharpshooter and quick-draw artist who wields a pair of revolvers. Through cunning and guile (and the help of his young son Daigoro, who acts as a decoy), Itto defeats the armed man and takes his guns. The other is defeated by Itto in a sword duel.Itto's battle culminates in his facing the deputy's army perhaps 200 men singlehandedly. For the first time, the true power of the baby cart is revealed as it proves to harbor an entire arsenal of weapons, including spears, daggers, a bullet-proof shield, and a small battery of guns, capable of taking out many enemy soldiers like a heavy machine gun. All of the deputy's men are killed as Itto first takes out half of them with the baby cart's machine gun, and then takes out the rest with his sword and other weapons from the baby cart. The deputy is the last to fall when Itto, deprived of his sword when it falls out of his hands when he falls down an embankment, takes out one of the pistols he took earlier from the deputy bodyguard and uses it to shoot and kill the deputy. Itto then discards the gun and reclaims his sword, mumbling to himself that firearms are so uncivilized.Word of the fight has been passed to neighboring districts, and the ronin Kanbei shows up just after Itto has slain the deputy, and makes his demand again for a duel. Though battle-weary, Itto accepts the challenge. The fight is over in an instant. Itto is sliced across his back, but Kanbei is mortally wounded, impaled on Itto's Dotanuki battle sword.As Kanbei kneels to the ground, dying, he tells Itto his story and why he became a ronin a tale involving an ambush on his master's convoy. Seeing his side outnumbered, Kanbei seized an opportunity and ran ahead to attack the enemy head on. He surprised the enemy and prevailed in deflecting the hostiles, and saved the lord's life as a result, but since he left his lord's side, he was dishonored and expelled from the clan. He questions Itto whether he had done the wrong thing, and whether being a samurai means to fight and live, or to simply never leave the master's side and die. Itto replied that he would have done the same. ""I am glad to hear that,"" Kanbei says, who then asks the former shogun's executioner to act as his ""second"" in the act of seppuku. This Itto does with honor.When asked by Kanbei what is the true ""Way of the Warrior"", Itto replies that it is neither to simply live nor die, but to live through death.As Itto walks away, pushing Daigoro and the baby cart, Torizo begins to runs after him, but is stopped by her men. They implore her not to go to him, saying he is not human, but a monster."
Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart in Peril,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143348/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ogami is hired to kill a tattooed female assassin.

Gunbei Yagyu, an enemy samurai, happens upon Ogami's son, and sees his chance for revenge.—barabbas <barabbas@dsp.net> In this fourth 'Lone Wolf and Baby Cart' movie we are introduced to Oyuki, a tattooed female assassin and the renegade member of a daimyo's personal bodyguard detail who is killing every man that is sent up against her. Along with her deadly use of the short blade, she strips to the waist while fighting to reveal elaborate tattoos on her chest and back. On her front is a kintar grasping her left breast. A portrait of a mountain witch covers her back. She then cuts off her victims' topknots, or chonmage, which brings dishonor to the dead man and his family.Ogami Itto, the disgraced former shogun's executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin, is hired to kill Oyuki. He tracks down the tattoo artist, who explains that she was a ""fine"" woman who did not scream as he dug into her flesh with his needles.Meanwhile, Itto's 3-year-old son, Daigoro, has grown restless waiting by the baby cart his father uses to trundle him about in. He goes exploring and finds a pair of performing clowns on the street. When the clowns finish their performance, Daigoro follows them, hoping to see more. But the clowns shoo him away, saying it's time to go home. Now, Daigoro has wandered too far. He is lost, and has become separated from his father.Agents of the Ogamis' mortal enemies, the Yagyu, are never far away. A procession of them, accompanied by the sound of gongs and loud shrieks, sends Daigoro into hiding. Itto must give up his search rather than risk an entanglement with the men, so he travels on alone.Daigoro spends days looking for his father, searching in every temple in the countryside. He enters one temple and sees a figure at the altar praying, but it is not his father. Rather, it is a man whom Daigoro immediately recognizes as someone who is unfriendly.The man follows Daigoro, who wanders into a grass field as it is being lit on fire by farmers. Unwittingly, Daigoro is surrounded by the flames, but he proves his resourcefulness by burying himself and surviving.The man then turns his sword on Daigoro, who raises a stick to defend himself, and in that instant the man realizes who Daigoro is. Just then, Itto comes into the picture, and the two recognize each other. The man, it turns out is Gunbei Yagyu, the outcast son of Retsudo Yagyu (from the first 'Lone Wolf' movie). Gunbei and Itto had competed for the post of shogun's executioner, and Gunbei's fierce swordsmanship surely would have won him the post, but in his overzealousness, he ends up pointing his sword at the shogun a taboo movement that costs him the job and makes him an outcast.Itto and Gunbei now have a rematch, but Itto is much improved and is ready for Gunbei. With a swift stroke, he chops off Gunbei's right arm. Gunbei then begs Itto to kill him, but Itto refuses, saying there is nothing to be gained from slaying a man who is already dead.With Gunbei out of the way and father and son reunited, the action then turns on finding the tattooed killer, Oyuki. He first stops at a settlement of street actors that Oyuki was said to be a part of. He talks to the elder and hears more of her story, and it happens that the elder is Oyuki's father, who is opposed to her actions, and cooperates with Itto.Itto finally locates Oyuki at a hot spring and witnesses her in action against more vassals who have come to try and kill her. Then her arch nemesis, her former instructor who raped her and set her on her bloody vendetta, shows up with his flaming sword and blazing eyes. But she is no longer in his sway, and when he sees her tattoos, he is distracted and killed.Finally, Itto and Oyuki must duel, and he makes quick work of her. She dies a splendid death, as Itto says, without having to disrobe.Retsudo Yagyu, meanwhile, has been playing politics. He manipulates a local daimyo into bringing in Itto, but Itto is able to use the baby cart and its weapons to escape from the daimyo's palace and take the man hostage. As Itto is leaving the area with the daimyo along for safety, he is attacked by the Yagyu. The daimyo is killed by some musketeers and Itto goes headlong into battle, telling his son Daigoro that he is entering the ""crossroads to hell."" It is a fierce battle, ending with Itto and Retsudo in combat. They trade blows Retsudo gets a blade in his right eye and Itto a sword in his back. Itto kills the swordsman who stabs him, but Retsudo gets away.Daigoro finds his father and with great effort, pulls the sword from his father's back. Despite being severely wounded, Itto carries Daigoro to the cart and slowly pushes it away, seeking medical treatment for himself. Watching over the scene is the now one-armed Gunbei, who is happy to see Itto live to fight another day."

A biker comes upon a girl with a flat tire and offers her a ride home. He winds up at a drug party with the girl's sister, then follows her to a turkey farm owned by her father, a mad scientist. The father turns the biker into a giant turkey monster who goes after drug dealers.—frankfob2@yahoo.com Narrator [Brad Grinter], puffing on a cigarette: The one constant in this world is that things change.
There is order in change in that one thing leads to the next thing, and
one seemingly random event can affect the course of the future.Herschel [Steve Hawkes], an out-of-work and homeless Vietnam vet, meets and
befriends Jesus freak Angel [Heather Hughes] when her car breaks down on the Florida
turnpike. Angel takes Herschel home where her hot-to-trot sister Ann [Dana Cullivan] is
smoking marijuana and doing drugs with a bunch of her friends.Narrator: *puff* Angel and Ann are both truth-seekers, although each goes
at it from a different angle.Herschel accompanies Angel to a meeting with her Jesus freak friend
Tom Nolan [?], who offers Herschel a job on his poultry ranch. Angel invites
Herschel to stay with her and Ann until he can get on his feet. The next
day, as Herschel cleans their swimming pool, Ann dons her bikini and tries
to get Herschel to notice her. When that doesn't work, she gets Herschel
to take a drag on a joint laced with something that Ann's friend Guy [Larry Wright]
guarantees will hook him after only a few tokes. Into the bedroom they go,
and off comes Ann's bikini.Narrator: *puff* Because Herschel is a real man, he couldn't refuse Ann's
attentions. But the paths of life are predicatable, and we choose them
over and over again.The next morning, Herschel heads over to the Midway Turkey Farm &
Hatchery. Tom introduces Herschel to Lenny and Gene, who work in the
farm's laboratory. They are currently researching the chemical
""caponization"" of poultry. Needing a human to eat the meat in order to see
if there are any side-effects, they rope Herschel into it by offering him
some recreational drugs for his personal use. Later that evening, Herschel
begins to withdraw from that incredibly-addicting grass and is in dire
need of a fix. Ann calls Guy, who brings over some more weed.The next day at work, Lenny presents Herschel with a whole roasted
turkey, which Herschel proceeds to gobble down. After finishing off the
turkey, Herschel isn't feeling so good, so he goes for a stroll in the
yard and passes out in the bushes. Lenny finds Herschel suffering from
convulsions in the grass and he and Gene cart him off and dump his body
elsewhere. Sure that they are going to be caught for killing Herschel,
Lenny and Gene split. Later that evening, the drugs appear to have run
their course, and Herschel wakes up and goes home to Ann. Unfortunately,
Herschel has turned into a were-turkey and can only communicate with Ann
by writing; when he tries to speak, all that comes out is a gobble.
[Herein is one of the most bizarre seduction scenes I've ever seen.] Ann
feels awful, because she thinks it is all her fault, so she calls her
sister Angel.Narrator: *puff* Interesting how, in times of trouble but not before, we
turn to God. Be careful what you pray for.Herschel has learned that he can get his drug fix by hanging users by
their feet, slitting their necks, and drinking their blood. While Herschel
goes around drinking the blood of various drug-abusing girls, Ann talks
turkey with two of her friends, trying to get them to help her find and
take care of Herschel until he reverts back to normal. When Herschel is
spotted by a non-druggie man, he is forced to kill the man. The man's wife
or son (it's hard to tell) attacks Herschel and stabs him in the eye.
Bleeding all over his turkey feathers, Herschel stumbles home to Ann.Meanwhile, Guy is trying to buy more drugs, but his pusher refuses to
deliver unless Guy pays what he already owes. Guy offers him $175 and a
chance to make it with Ann, who is taking a nap in the bedroom. The pusher
agrees. As he fondles Ann's breasts, she wakes up and sees that it isn't
Herschel. The pusher sees Herschel out the window and runs out of Ann's
bedroom. He tries to hide in a garage, but Herschel finds him and cuts off
his leg with a tablesaw. Herschel isn't feeling too steady and falls to
his knees in the grass. As Herschel folds his hands in prayer, Ann's two
friends find him. They cut off the head of a turkey. The final scene shows
people's hands tearing the meat from a roasted turkey. Next to the turkey
is Herschel's turkey head.But wait a minute. Back up a few paragraphs and pick up where
Herschel goes for a walk and passes out in the bushes. Tom finds Herschel.
It was all a hallucination. Turns out that Herschel was badly burned in
Vietnam and became addicted to pain killers. The combination of smoking
marijuana and eating drugged turkey brought on hallucinations. Tom calls
Angel who works at the Drug Center. Angel calls Ann and offers to bring
her to pick up Herschel at the turkey farm, but Ann feels too guilty to
face Herschel right now. Angel explains everything to Herschel, tells him
how much Ann loves him, and they pray together to increase Herschel's
faith.Narrator: *puff* This movie has been a story about the horrors that can
occur when we use the human body as a mixing bowl for drugs. *cough*
*puff* *cough* *hack*Epilogue: Herschel finds Ann walking alone on a pier near the ocean. They
smile at each other, kiss, and walk away in each other's arms. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Philipp Wermeer has been framed for the murder of a powerful figure known as The Patriarch. Wermeer escapes, but the three Saxon brothers, sons of The Patriarch, have arranged for a large bounty on Wermeer's head. Clayton is a grizzled ex-sheriff stripped of his office in Jefferson after refusing to acknowledge Wermeer's guilt. During a series of fire-fights, Clayton contrives to help Wermeer escape from attacks of bounty-hunters. Together, the two make their way to Jefferson, where they can confront the three powerful Saxon brothers, and reveal the surprising truth about who killed The Patriarch.—Charles Delacroix Holed up in the dusty town of Gila Bend, Philip Vermeer, an escaped prisoner convicted of killing Ebenezer ""The Patriarch"" Saxon, is saved by the skin of his teeth when Clayton, the hard-boiled ex-sheriff of Jefferson City, fends off an army of murderous bounty hunters sent by the three sons of the deceased. Of course, Vermeer claims that he is innocent, framed by the corrupt judge who was paid off by the Saxons; however, Clayton, who tries to bring him to justice and ensure a fair trial, knows that he has to take matters into his own hands and let guns speak. Now, the Saxon gang is nipping at their heels, hell-bent on making Vermeer pay; but, if Philip is indeed innocent, then, who killed the Patriarch?—Nick Riganas In the Wild West, Philip Wermeer (Peter O'Brien) has escaped from prison where he serves a sentence for the murder of Ebenezer Saxon, the patriarch of Saxon city, who in his turn is believed to be behind the murder of Wermeer's father. Wermeer is holed up in the small mining town of Gila Bend by a swarm of bounty killers, who want his $3,000 reward, posted by Saxon's three sons David, Eli and Adam. A sheriff named Clayton (Lee Van Cleef) arrives on a stagecoach and bosses his way through the cordon set up by the local lawmen. While walking to the saloon, he performs actions that tip off Wermeer as to where some of the besiegers are hidden (like throwing a lit match so a man hidden in a haystack has to put it out). Wermeer makes it to the saloon, where Clayton, who has counted Wermeer's shots and knows that he is out of bullets, arrests him. Holk, a spokesman for the bounty killers, calls on Wermeer to surrender. A shot rings out and Clayton emerges dragging the ""dead"" convict. They argue that Clayton is a sheriff and therefore he cannot collect bounty, and that he instead should give up the body. The disagreement develops into a gunfight. Wermeer jumps up on a horse and escapes, pursued by the pack (though not Clayton). Wermeer makes the bounty hunters follow his horse, then hitches a ride with the stagecoach, where he finds Clayton among the passengers.When the group stays for the the night at Silver Bells, Wermeer goes for a shotgun hanging on the wall, but Clayton stops him. A drunken stationmaster assures the gun is empty, but Clayton retorts: ""Never consider a gun empty"". Then he and Wermeer play cards, Wermeer betting his $3,000 bounty. Wermeer wins and Clayton promises to take him to Saxon city as he wants. Wermeer steals a revolver from Clayton's bag, but is told that it is empty. Wermeer repeats Clayton's earlier saying and pulls the trigger, but Clayton shows him the bullet, taking it out of his mouth. Wermeer tries to leave, but Clayton shoots the door, this time with the other five bullets.Meanwhile, the bounty hunters led by Holk surround the house. They give Wermeer 30 seconds. He and Clayton are inside with Elisabeth, a female passenger who has earlier shown interest in Wermeer. Clayton tells her that Wermeer is innocent and that he saw who did it, but if Wermeer walks out the door he will never know. Wermeer gives himself up. Holk and two of the bounty hunters now kill the others in their pack, then ride off with Wermeer.Clayton finds them beating and questioning Wermeer in a waterfall, asking where the silver of his father is and offering to let him go if he tells. Clayton shoots off the rope and liberates him. Wermeer asks if he is still a prisoner. When Clayton says no, he holds a gun against Clayton and rides off to Saxon city on the latter's horse. After arriving Wermeer confronts the Saxon sons, Adam and Eli. He accuses Eli (who is the town's sheriff) and asks who killed his father. We also learn that Holk was sent by Eli to find out who really killed the old man Saxon. Clayton arrives and demands that the Saxons reopen Wermeer's case. Wermeer sends word to his friends and people loyal to his father to gather at the silver mine. A duel between Holk and Wermeer is supervised by Clayton after he reveals that it was Holk who killed Wermeer's father, following orders from Ebenezer Saxon. An ambush-er is there helping Holk, but Wermeer shoots him without Clayton interfering.David Saxon, the oldest of the brothers and the one responsible of running the town, orders Adam to stop the people heading to the silver mine. Shortly after, Adam massacres Wermeer's followers with hidden explosives and a machine gun. He also kills his own men, following his brother David's instructions to not leave any witnesses. Meanwhile David meets with Clayton, who says that they both know who killed the old man Saxon. David offers $25,000 if he and Wermeer leave town. Clayton relays the offer that the charge will be dropped. Wermeer replies that the Saxons made the offer because ""dead people don't need a leader"", and reveals the wagon in which he carries the bodies of those killed by Adam. Adam shoots him from a window, though Elisabeth, who arrived in town to marry Adam, cries out a warning. Clayton escapes during the gunfight.In the morning, Wermeer is to be hanged. Clayton says he knows who is the real killer. David wants the hanging to continue but Eli says that he must know. Clayton confesses that he himself did it, explaining that Ebenezer Saxon killed Wermeer's father, and that David Saxon bought the judge who sentenced Philip Wermeer and stripped Clayton of his title of Sheriff after he stood in trial to declare him innocent, so justice could only be done ""the Saxon way"". Clayton also denounces the massacre at the silver mine, and the Saxons agree to meet Clayton at the cattle pens.At the confrontation, when Clayton approaches, David says that the three must draw first to overcome Clayton's faster and expert gun play. Wermeer, from a distance, shoots off Clayton's hat so that he draws first. It works and Clayton reacts by killing the three men and only getting a small wound. Wermeer picks up his hat and gun and says that Clayton now can go back to being a sheriff. Wermeer leaves for Mexico with Elisabeth, not caring about the silver. Bighorse, the old man from the stagecoach that carried the initial group, now friends with Wermeer, drives them down the road, while Clayton goes his own way."

Dusty Cole is a young prostitute who lives with her boyfriend, Tony, in a small apartment above a street front store somewhere in Queens, New York. When Tony arrives home after grocery shopping, he is dismayed to see Dusty sitting around the small apartment, doing nothing. Tom and Dusty get into a big argument where Tony demands that she either get a job or clean up the place. Dusty manages to calm him down by pleasuring him with sex.When Tony leaves to go to work at his job as a bartender for the afternoon and evening shift, Dusty packs her suitcase, steals some items from his apartment including an old TV set and a tape recorder. She goes down the street to a pawn shop and tries to sell the items for cash. The sleazy owner, Sammy, refuses to give Dusty any money for the worthless items, but instead offers to give her $55 if she has sex with him in the back storage room. After having sex, Dusty tells Sammy that she wants to meet him later for lunch. While he is not looking, she steals an extra set of keys off a hook in the storage room. When she leaves the store and Sammy leaves soon after and locks up, Dusty returns, steals all the cash she saw him kept in a vase in the back room, as well as some silver items, and leaves the store, throwing the spare keys in a wastebasket outside on the street. Dusty then takes a subway train to Manhattan.The next morning, while walking down 42nd Street near Times Square, Dusty runs into an old friend, an aging drag queen hooker named Cherry Lane. After talking over coffee, Dusty shacks up with Cherry at his small apartment in the Lower East Side where they decide to team up to trade tricks like the old days when Dusty used to cruise 42nd street and hustle johns and other victims out of their money. There, a trick named Jimmie visits, and upon seeing Dusty, insists on hiring her instead of Cherry. Although Cherry is concerned that Dusty will steal her clients, she accepts Dusty's offer of half of her earnings. After Cherry leaves the apartment, Dusty insists that Jimmie have sex ""normally,"" but as soon as they begin, he takes out a belt and whips her. Afterward, she inquires about his wife and recalls her own four-month marriage at the age of sixteen. When Jimmie, like all of Dusty's tricks, declares that his wife will not have sex with him, Dusty counsels him to be more honest and more demanding with his wife. He asks her to attend a poker game the next Friday night, in order to have sex with four men present, for a fee of $150. After agreeing, Dusty shies away when Jimmie touches her face, then tells him her reaction is ""just a reflex.""That night, Dusty and Cherry go to a bar with another homosexual prostitute, Billy. They are joined by the Simmons sisters, Susie and Sally, two loud and boozy streetwalkers with whom Cherry regularly spars. Susie and Sally show off some of their singing ability while talking about currently working at an off-off-Broadway theater to make some extra money on the sides.

When he stares into her eyes, she flinches and asks that he not look too deep, but he responds that he is not looking for perfection.

Dusty states that Bob makes her want to change and go ""legit,"" and she plans to take it slow with him.Although Dusty announces that she is canceling her Friday night appointment at the poker game, Cherry, concerned that she is so quickly losing her new roommate and source of income, urges her to go. Dusty reluctantly concedes, and shows up to the game, where Jimmie, along with three card-playing friends, Walt, Joe and Carl, have a separate room available for her use. After the first man, Joe, takes his turn, Jimmie enters and, against Dusty's wishes, begins to beat her again.

In the morning, she walks with him to the ferry he takes to work, but as they step into the street, Bob is run over by a car. As a crowd gathers around, Dusty claims not to know him and runs off, collapsing in tears around the corner.In the final scene, set some time later in Times Square on the street outside the notorious Grant's Deli, Dusty is seen back to the only life she knows, turning tricks on the streets while clearly high on drugs."

A thief breaks into the home of a wealthy, happily married Beverly Hills couple. He soon finds out, though, that the couple is neither as wealthy as he thought they were and are not as happily married as they appeared.—Anonymous In Beverly Hills, CA, used-car salesman Bill Lennox (Andrew Duggan) grows overwhelmed by the hypocrisy and shallowness of his work and the empty, extravagant life he leads with his self-indulgent wife of 19 years, Bernadette (Joyce Van Patten). One morning while the couple lounge at their swimming pool, Bill is horrified to find a live rat in the drain. When a tall black stranger (Yaphet Kotto) appears, Bill and Bernadette conclude that he is an exterminator and explain their predicament. After killing the rat, however, the man refuses to depart, prompting Bill and Bernadette to rightly fear that he is a criminal coming to rob them. Although the man has no weapon, Bill and Bernadette comply with his order to go to the house, where they proudly relate the structure's long Hollywood history. When the man, who introduces himself as 'Bone', rifles through a desk and finds a photo of a handsome young man, the Lennoxes explain it is their son, who is a lieutenant in the army currently serving in Vietnam.Critical of the couple's numerous charge-account debts, Bone demands money, but Bill admits their bank account is empty and many of their bills are overdue. Bone continues to threaten the couple and after hitting Bill in the stomach, forces them to their bedroom, where he discovers a small box under the bed. Opening the box, Bone finds papers revealing that Bill has taken out a loan against the house, as well as another loan against his life insurance policy, both without Bernadette's knowledge. Outraged, Bernadette turns on Bill and as a furious argument ensues between them right in front of their captor. Bone comes upon a checkbook in Bill's name with $5,000.Disgusted by the Lennoxes' bickering, Bone threatens to tie them up together, but Bernadette refuses and Bill offers to go to the bank to retrieve the money. Bone agrees, but insists Bill return in one hour with the money or he will rape and murder Bernadette. As Bill hurries away in his Rolls Royce, Bernadette nervously listens as Bone describes the squalor of his childhood and how he was forced to kill the cockroaches that infested his family's home.A little later at the bank, Bill is disconcerted when a young woman (Jeannie Berlin) begins chatting with him as he waits anxiously in a long line. Once Bill reaches the teller and makes his request, the teller suggests that he take out a loan rather than make a full withdrawal. Abruptly recalling Bernadette's refusal to be tied up with him, Bill leaves without making the withdrawal.At a bar across the street, a woman recognizes Bill from his television advertisements and strikes up a conversation, then offers to pay the bar tab when Bill realizes he has no money.Back at the Lennox home, after Bone demands that Bernadette make him a meal, she admits with embarrassment that she does not cook, as she and Bill dine out frequently. Growing more fearful as the hour quickly slips by, Bernadette makes a full pitcher of cocktails and urges Bone to share it with her.Meanwhile, while walking down Sunset Boulevard, Bill runs into the young woman from the bank and, drawn to her, accompanies her to a grocery store, where she convinces him to steal several items then pays for others using food stamps. Bill then accepts her invitation to lunch at her apartment and purposely avoids looking at his watch.Although Bernadette grows drunk, when Bone tells her the hour is up and he will make good on his threat, she sobers up and struggles furiously as he strips off her bathing suit and throws her on top of the pool table. When Bone does not go through with the rape, however, Bernadette is grateful, then puzzled.Back in town, Bill lunches with the woman, who is surprised when he admits that he does not have a mistress. The woman confides that she was molested by her father when she was a child, then proceeds to seduce Bill by re-enacting her molestation.Back at the Lennox home, Bone admits to Bernadette that he initially embraced the role that society had created for black men as criminals and rapists. The recent shift in cultural and social attitudes on racial relations, however, had affected Bone, who has been unable to recapture the mystique of being the ""Negro Rapist."" Moved by his confession, Bernadette empathizes and says white men have similar difficulties, then sets about seducing Bone. Although initially uncomfortable, Bone eventually gives in. Afterward, Bernadette telephones the bank and is angered to learn that Bill did not make the withdrawal. Fearful that Bill will return with the police, Bone grows anxious to depart, but Bernadette considers Bill's behavior, then tells Bone they should kill him and collect the life insurance.Back in town, Bill flees from the clinging woman and at a phone booth contacts the police to leave an anonymous tip about Bone, but, suspecting the call is a prank, the police hang up on him. Now frightened by the long lapse of time, Bill goes to his advertising agent, Woody (James Lee), to ask for money. Calculating that Bill is at Woody's, Bernadette gives Bone her husband's clothes and drives him into town. On the way, she confesses to Bone that they lied about their son, who is actually languishing in a Spanish prison for attempting to smuggle hash out of Tangiers. Bernadette grows distressed when she can not recall when or why she and Bill made up the lie about their son, and Bone comforts her.Arriving at Woody's, who has refused to lend Bill money, Bernadette and Bone chase Bill, who gets on a bus headed to the beach. Bernadette and Bone follow and threaten Bill throughout the long ride, but confident that the two will not act in front of witnesses, Bill says he will remain on the bus. Later, realizing the bus has emptied of all the passengers, Bill panics and gets off at the beach, pursued by Bone and Bernadette. Bone assures Bill his murder will be quick and painless, but when Bill breaks into a monologue from his advertising, an outraged Bernadette attacks him furiously, beating him unconscious, then smothering him in the sand. Taken aback, Bone attempts to intervene, but Bernadette says she does need him. Ecstatic about having killed Bill, Bernadette looks around moments later and is shocked to find that Bone has disappeared. Suddenly terrified, Bernadette struggles to concoct a story to tell the police that Bill was killed by a large black man, then lapses into despair when she cannot recall why or how she decided to murder her husband."

But the Italian Army has been bugging the senate phones, in the hope of learning something that will ensure the planned military coup stays on course. The Vatican secret police, led by the percistiant Mafioso Don Gesualdo (Corrado Gaipa) have been bugging the army's phones and also learn about Puppi's mysterous exit. Cardinal Maravigili (Lional Standar), a powerfull member of the clergy, which has the real power in Italy, is sitting in his office watching the film footage of Puppis at the airport. Cardinal Maravigili is enraged for apparently Puppis owes his political success to shady deals with the Vatican and military hierarchy. Maravgili, a manipulative sociopath willing to commit murder to facilitate divine will, has groomed Puppis for position of president. Even Puppis preference for men is tolerated for the cardinal confindes in Don Gesualdo that he prefers that Puppis should be homosexual, expecting less scandal from this man than the customary womanizing of Italian politicians.At the spiritual retreat, Puppis describes a dream to Father Schirer while under hypnosis, featuring the devout nurses at the clinic, and visions of the Garden of Eden where foliage bursts with naked female bottoms. The next night, Puppis sleepwalks to Father Schirer's room and molests him while he is fast asleep. Protecting his vow of chastity, the priest/analyst wakes up the randy senator. Once fully awake, Puppis realizes his actions and professes to feel much better claiming his dreams have liberated his mind. The following morning, Puppis returns to Rome full of optimism about his cure. However back at the clinic, when Father Schirer takes confession from the nuns, he discovers that Puppis rampaging sexual dreams have actually been enacted for real. The libidinous sisters all recount sexual encounters with Puppis.An angry Father Schirer arrives at Puppis house and demands an explanation. But he is forced to hide when Cardinal Maravigili arrives unexpectedly to meet with Puppis. Hiding in the bathroom in a shower cubical, Father Schirer suffers a fatal heart attack when he thinks that Cardinal Maravigili will walk in. Unaware of Schirer's sudden demise, Puppis leaves with Cardinal Maravigili to a garden party prior to the celebration of the founding of the Italian Republic. After experiencing erotic visions, Puppis swiftly seduces the French ambassador's wife (Anita Strindberg) in the bushes. Back at Puppis house, Carmelino discovers the dead body of Father Schirer and rushes to tell Puppis, only to be grabbed by Don Gesualdo leading the Vatican secret police, and he is taken away.Returning home later that evening, Puppis is visited by Sister Hildergardt (Laura Antonelli), the only one of the cloistered order not to have been ravished by him. Begging him to relived her of temptation and simultaneously scolding him for wickedness, she implores that they whip each for their sins. Just as the twisted couple get down to it, the Vatican thugs arrive. Puppis and Sister Hildergardt escape through a back window.Hiding out in a secluded motel room, Puppis and Sister Hildergardt are tracked down where Don Gesualdo and his thugs take her away. Puppis is confronted in the motel room by Cardinal Maravigli where he tells the cardinal that he wants out of politics. But the cardinal replies that there will none of that talk. Too much time and effort has been expended behind the scenes to hoist Puppis into position as the puppet Chief of State for his feelings to matter now. The Cardinal takes Puppis into the bowels of the Vatican to view waxworks of recently canonized saints. The include Carmelino and Father Lucian as well as Father Schirer. The threat to Puppis is made explicit when he is told to look carefully at an unfinished rough wax model. Staring at the shapeless features, Puppis imagines a waxwork of himself. When Senator Torsello dies the next day in a mysterous ""plane crash"", Puppis is declared the winner of the election by default now that his polical opposition has been removed.At a ceremony to accept his appointment as president of Italy, Puppis genuflects before a wax statue of Sister Hildergardt. Puppis knows that he is trapped in his own political position with the corrupt Vatican thugs he knows that he now can never escape from. ""The new president is remarkably religious,"" whispers an onlooker to another. As Puppis, the new chief of state, gives his inaugural address on live TV, the televised ceremony is switched off by a customer in a local bar, who chooses instead to watch an asinine game show on the next channel."

Armed with a hammer and a wooden stake, he arrives at Castle Dracula and duly dispatches the vampire Count. Next day, however, Dr. Frankenstein arrives with his assistant, Morpho, and a large crate containing the monster. Using the blood of a pub singer who has been abducted by his creation, the doctor brings Dracula back to life and uses him for his own ends. The Count and a female vampire continue to terrorise the town, so Dr Seward once again sets out for Castle Dracula. Unfortunately, he is attacked by the Frankenstein monster and left for dead. Amira, a gypsy, rescues him and summons up a werewolf to do battle with the forces of evil...—A Franco fan Doctor Jonathan Seward [Alberto Dalbés] runs the Halic Sewardis Klinik (Seward
Sanitarium) while doing a little vampire hunting on the side. When he
examines the body of a girl who has recently died, he notices the two
telltale puncture wounds on her neck. Looks like Drácula [Howard Vernon] is on the prowl
again, so Dr Seward pays a visit to Castle Drácula and runs a stake
through the King Vampire's heart. Drácula turns into a bat and lays dead in
his coffin. Not long afterwards, a deaf-mute wanders into town looking for Castle
Drácula (hard to miss the huge castle at the top of a mountain just
outside of town). The deaf-mute is Morpho [Luis Barboo], lab assistant to Doctor Ranier
von Frankenstein [Dennis Price] who has also come to town with his monster and a grand
plan to awaken Drácula and create an Army of Shadows that will serve him
in his attempts to take over the world.He begins by awakening his monster, whom he then sends on a task to
kidnap a French cabaret singer [Josyane Gibert] so that he can use her blood to awaken
Drácula, which he does by giving the bat a bath in the blood. Poof!
Drácula is back, although he's more like a zombie now that he's a prisoner
of Dr Frankenstein. Frankenstein orders Drácula to be fruitful and
multiply and, so, leads him to his first victim--María, a flaky patient at
Seward's sanitarium. When Seward notices the two puncture wounds on María's neck, he
realizes that Drácula is at it again and heads back to the castle. On the
way, however, he is met by the Frankenstein monster, who beats him up and
leaves him for dead. Fortunately, Seward is found by a band of gypsies,
who take him home so that Amira [Genevieve Deloir], apparently their resident witch and
psychic, can care for him. Amira isn't feeling too good herself, having
been recently bitten by one of Drácula's vampiresses. She knows that her
time is short, but she explains to the doctor how the gypsies have been
slaves to Drácula and they're tired of it. She knows that Seward tried to
destroy Drácula once before and impresses upon him to try again and, in
doing so, free her people. This time, she's going to help by conjuring up
a werewolf during the next full moon.At the next full moon, Seward is feeling much better, but Amira is
worse. She has only enough strength left to remind him that the werewolf
will come this night and that he must kill Drácula and the other evil
things and so free the gypsies. Suddenly, the werewolf's howl can be heard
coming from Castle Drácula. While the werewolf and the monster fight it
out, Dr Frankenstein decides that Drácula has somehow betrayed him and
plunges a spear through his heart. Seward gathers up the gypsies, and they
all race up to the castle. The Frankenstein monster, bloodied from his
fight with the werewolf, returns to his own coffin and is electrocuted by
his creator. By the time Seward and the gypsies get there, both Drácula
and Maria have been reduced to skeletons. Seward holds up a crucifix and
thanks God for His divine help. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Encounter with the Unknown,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072937/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three eerie tales based on actual events are enacted in this film. First, three college students play a prank on a geeky classmate, who is accidentally shot and killed. His vengeful mother forecasts the deaths of the three young men she holds responsible, on 7, 14, and 21 days hence. And, one by one, her grim predictions come true. Next, a ghoulish sound emanates from a mist-shrouded hole in the Earth near where a Missouri boy has lost his dog. The boy's father is lowered into the hole and lets out an agonizing scream! Finally, a senator returning home from a party finds a lost girl on a bridge and learns from her father that she died years earlier!—Kevin McCorry <mmccorry@nb.sympatico.ca> The film presents three allegedly true stories of the supernatural. The first story, ""The Heptagon"", opens on a somber note at the funeral of college student Johnny Davis. His friends Dave, Frank and Randy are in attendance at the burial. It is revealed that they played a seemingly innocent phone prank on Johnny, telling him to go to a certain address where a date was waiting. The old woman who lived at the address accidentally shot Johnny to death. As the funeral service ends, Johnny's mother (who is the seventh daughter of a seventh son) recites a cryptic message to the three young men she blames for the death of her son: ""One by land, two by sky...seven times around go the three of you, and may your reward be just and true."" Later Frank relates this story to a priest, Father Duane, sitting next to him on a plane. He says that Dave was run over and killed seven days after the funeral. The priest tries to ease Frank's anxiety, assuring him that it's all a coincidence. However, after Father Duane exits the plane, it crashes upon takeoff. On the runway Father Duane attempts to comfort a dying Frank, who tells him that exactly fourteen days have passed since Johnny's burial. The troubled priest--beginning to suspect that there might be more to this pattern of deaths than mere chance--speaks to his superior, who suggests telephoning the remaining young man at the state university. Father Duane tries to call Randy but instead reaches his roommate, who tells him that Randy has gone skydiving. It is now twenty-one days after Johnny's burial, the narrator reminds us, and according to Mrs. Davis's prophecy, two of the young men would perish by sky.The second story, ""The Darkness"", is set in rural Missouri during the early twentieth century and involves the disappearance of a boy's dog in the vicinity of a mysterious hole in the ground. Concerned about the inexplicable moaning sounds coming from the hole, the boy's father agrees to be lowered in on a rope to see if he can recover the dog and to find out what's making the noise. Suddenly a terrifying scream emerges from the depths of the pit and the boy's father, now a raving lunatic, is hoisted back up. The mystery of the hole is never solved, and the story closes with the narrator's revelation that the father spent the rest of his life in an insane asylum.The final segment, ""The Girl on the Bridge"", involves a strange disoriented girl and the Arkansas state senator who attempts to give her a ride home. Most of the story unfolds via the girl's flashbacks; as the senator and his wife arrive at the address the girl had given them, they find that she has mysteriously vanished from the back seat of the car. The girl's elderly father answers the door, telling the senator that his daughter died in a car accident many years earlier when she and her boyfriend were leaving town to get married. The father had disapproved of the relationship and told his daughter that he would rather see her dead.According to the opening narration, the stories are based on research conducted by Dr. Jonathan Rankin, a parapsychologist, but this is evidently a fictional device as no record of the name ""Jonathan Rankin"" exists in the annals of parapsychological research. One of the segments, ""The Girl on the Bridge"", is simply a version of the Vanishing hitchhiker, a widespread and very popular urban legend. The stories themselves are narrated by Rod Serling, but the opening and closing portions of the film feature a second, uncredited narrator."

In the late 1800s London, surgeon Dr. William Jekyll (Dennis De Marne) procures the corpse of a murderer and rapist, hoping to prove his theory that he can isolate and treat the part of the brain associated with evil behavior. Although he is confident in his research, the medical establishment disputes his radical ideas, thus isolating Jekyll to a home laboratory. Regardless, Jekyll is excited by the promise of curing murderers and sex criminals and eagerly demonstrates to his six students, Victoria, Lucas, Webb, MacGregor, Jones and Murphy in a local classroom a formula that, when injected into the corpses brain, locates the evil sections by turning them a green hue. Although one student Murphy (Jeremy Brooks) walks out, stating that tampering with the soul is the dominion only of God, his other five students, as well as his assistant Smithers (Berwick Kaler) and loyal Victoria (Jennifer Summerfield), are committed to his experiments.That night, Jekyll, having already worked with live laboratory animals, finalizes his antidote to change the behavior then shows the written formula to Smithers and asks him to copy it. While Jekyll is out of the room, Smithers accidentally spills liquid on the document, which he then attempts to rewrite. Although he realizes that his notes might not be accurate, Smithers is too embarrassed to tell Jekyll the truth and leaves.Late that night, Jekyll's ever patient and loving fiancee Mary Ann Marsden (Gay Feld) pries him from his laboratory to attend their engagement party at her family's house. Over dinner, Mary Ann's brother, Dr. Oliver Marsden explains to their father, who also is a doctor, that both his work and Jekyll's are too progressive.The next day, Jekyll becomes sullen after learning that the next shipment of live laboratory animals is delayed, thus postponing any trial of the antidote. Although Smithers senses that Jekyll is becoming desperate, he once again avoids telling his master the possibility of his having made a mistake in copying down the antidote. Alone that night, Jekyll tests the formula on himself and is immediately tortured by crushing pain. Looking in the mirror, he sees a pale, gruesome and unrecognizable fiend, Mr. Danny Blood. Despite choking down the antidote, Danny Blood becomes enraged and flees into the streets.Stopping at a pub, Danny Blood grabs singer April Conners, who, despite the strangers gruff manners, eagerly accepts his money for sex. When her latest lover tries to intercede, Blood leads him outside and beats him unconscious with his cane. Unaware of the danger, April takes Blood to her apartment, where he sadistically demands that he serve him, burns her with a cigarette and then beats her mercilessly. After threatening to kill her if she mentions the incident to anyone, Blood returns to the street, where he slashes a prostitute with such precision, that upon finding her dead body, the police suspect the murderer has some medical knowledge.Waking up the next day in his lab, Jekyll cannot recall his evening's activities, but his torn and blood-stained clothes concern his sister Carla (Jacqueline Lawrence). Jekyll, whose temper is now easily aroused, can only show bitter hatred for her and shuts her out of the laboratory. While working with his students that afternoon, Jekyll looses his train of thought as his mind becomes increasingly deranged. Realizing Jekyll's erratic behavior must be the result of not using the correct antidote, Smithers privately admits his mistake to Jekyll, who then explains that after he secretly took the formula and antidote, he was consumed by evil thoughts and now cannot remember his actions from the previous night. Fearing that authorities will shut down his experiments, Jekyll swears Smithers to secrecy until he can find the formula for the real antidote.Returning his students, Jekyll turns vicious and ridicules Victoria, insisting that women were meant to remain home as slaves to men. Jekyll then collapses in a rage, prompting Smithers to sedate the doctor and put him to bed. Fearing for the doctor's health, Smithers tells the details of their research and his own mistake to Carla, who later tells Jekyll that she knows the truth, then leaves to seek help from Oliver. Enraged by Smithers' betrayal, Jekyll transforms into Blood, then murders Smithers and returns to April, whom he beats with a belt. As he leaves her building, Blood pays for another prostitute, who takes him to an orgy, where participants are bound to the walls and tortured.Waking up the next day again with no memory of the past evening, Jekyll conducts his class, then meets Victoria alone. Excited by Jekyll's suggestion for a paper she is writing, Victoria embraces and kisses him. The intimacy prompts his violent urge to return and Jekyll momentarily attacks Victoria. Quickly recovering, Jekyll apologizes, but Victoria is so distraught by his unpredictable behavior that she tells Carla.Meanwhile, April, having found a calling card for Jekyll that fell from Danny Blood's bag, seeks the physicians help, not recognizing him as Blood. Although Jekyll assures her that the man will no longer haunt her, hours later Jekyll again becomes Blood and goes to Aprils apartment, where he beheads her with a hatchet. Meanwhile, Carla, Victoria and Oliver, who have gone to the police, make their way to Jekyll's house to force the doctor to commit himself to an asylum. Having heard the plan, Mary Ann rushes ahead to warn him, but he attacks her.

Timothy admits he has a bad feeling about their landlord, but Lily disagrees with him. When Timothy tries to drive off in anger, Ritchie's dogs suddenly appear and viciously circle his car, frightening him into honking until Ritchie comes out of his house to call them off. Amused by Timothy's fear, Ritchie says condescendingly that the dogs are unfamiliar with his smell.Another day later, as Lily and Ritchie walk along the beach, she explains that she met Timothy when he jumped out at her wearing a clown nose and made her laugh. Proudly, she explains that Timothy studied mime in Paris, art, photography and drawing and then, aware of Ritchie's unspoken disapproval of Timothy, adds that she hopes the beach house will bring out Timothy's good qualities. While talking, she strips down to her bikini in order to get a tan, embarrassing Ritchie. At her questioning, Ritchie admits that Timothy seems younger than his age, but evades answering her direct question of whether he thinks Timothy is immature. Lily points out that, while Ritchie feels certain about himself, Timothy ""does not know who he is yet."" Meanwhile, as Timothy is taking photographs of himself and the area, he encounters another bay resident, an older veteran named Stanley (Eric Clavering), who simply stares at him in amusement when he tries to start a conversation.One night, Ritchie invites the couple to his house, where Lily and (especially) Timothy get inebriated. Lily asks Timothy to perform mime and his clown act. As Timothy prepares in another room, Lily, sensing Ritchie's disdain of Timothy and wanting his respect, tentatively explains that she is more than she may seem and makes the money in their household. Ritchie interrupts, saying, ""I respect you."" Timothy then bursts into the room, with his face covered in shaving cream to imitate the white makeup of a mime, and begins to perform ""the definitive ape."" This disappoints Lily, who prefers his clown act, but Ritchie comments that Timothy shows more concentration when he does his ape routine than he shows in the rest of his life. He points out that gorillas are usually seen behind bars and, claiming that the experience of prison focuses a person, convinces Timothy to agree to meet him at dawn for a psychological experiment.The next morning, Ritchie wakens the hung-over Timothy and, treating him like a subordinate in the military, orders him to carry a pile of rocks to the beach. Timothy treats it as a joke, but Ritchie insists that he carry out the task. Leaving one of the dogs to guard Timothy, Ritchie proceeds to the beach house, where he wakens Lily, and stands at the door until she gets up and dresses. Then, after asking if he can ""borrow"" items, he walks through the rooms and gathers knives, razors, belts and other implements that could be used as weapons. Although bewildered, Lily plays along, acknowledging that they are playing a ""prison game.""As Timothy continues to move the pile of rocks, Ritchie and Lily sit and watch from the beach house porch. When Timothy starts to take a break, Ritchie orders him to stand and hold a large rock, and tells Lily that Timothy is undergoing the most therapeutic experience of his life. Ritchie informs Lily that, during Revolutionary War battles, families of officers often watched from nearby. He also describes how he collected guns from the enemy corpses in Vietnam and that when he was wounded, someone stole his guns, believing he was dead. Unexpectedly, the dog attacks Timothy, causing him to bleed and, although the wound is minor, both Lily and Timothy panic.In the evening, Timothy paints, ignoring Lily, who resumes a former smoking habit. At the same time, Stanley visits Ritchie, who regales him with military stories of tormenting subordinates, and their loud laughter, amplified by the water, unnerves Lily and Timothy. Later, the Frishers awaken to discover Ritchie towing away their car. When they go out to protest, the dogs threaten to attack them. During the night, Timothy tries to escape using the motorboat, forcing the frightened Lily to join him. However, the boat is cabled to the dock and Ritchie takes them back to the beach house, where he orders both dogs to guard them.The next day, which happens to be the Fourth of July, American Legionnaires ceremoniously present Ritchie with a flag to honor his deceased father, a colonel, as part of an annual ritual. Afterward, while Timothy continues to move the rocks, Lily goes to Ritchie's house to talk. When she admits she is lonely, Ritchie asks if it is because of Timothy and promises that the situation will soon be different. She asks Ritchie's opinion of her and he says she needs a man, not a boy, who will bring her ""peace and pleasure"" that she has never known. Lily agrees that her soul is starved and, as Ritchie confides to her a story about a little girl he knew as a child, she removes her clothing, angering Ritchie. When she begs him to let them leave, he yells at her, forcing her to retreat, naked, to the beach house. Ritchie then shouts at Timothy, who has removed his shirt in the hot sun, and tells him to put it back on and button it up. Almost incoherently, he bellows that buttons are the difference between wild savages and civilization.That night, still out of control, Ritchie prays for God to kill his enemies and burn them. He begs, ""Bring fire on them!"" and, as if on cue, a fireworks display commences, causing Ritchie to rejoice in sardonic glee. Meanwhile, Timothy pens up a dog and tries to barricade himself and Lily in the beach house. In retaliation, Ritchie shouts an attack command to the dogs, and while Timothy fends off one dog, Lily manages to stab the other dog to death. Soon after, Ritchie gains entrance through a window, and he and Timothy fight in the dark. Their struggling ends, and Ritchie, lying on the ground exhausted, catches his breath. Near him lies Timothy, who, between bursts of fireworks, relives moments from his recent past. Shortly after, Lily announces that Timothy is dead."
The Mattei Affair,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068346/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An Italian industrialist died in a plane crash. An accident or an assassination? Enrico Mattei helped change Italy's future, first as freedom-fighter against the Nazis, then as an investor in methane gas through a public company, A.G.I.P., and ultimately as the head of ENI, a state body formed for the development of oil resources. October 27, 1962, he died when his private airplane crashed, one minute before it should land at Milan airport. Officially, he died of a flight accident. Actually, many journalists explored other plausible reasons for the untimely landing of the small aircraft.—Artemis-9 This is the enigma and the mystery surrounding Enrico Mattei. It is a mosaic which surrounds a narrative film...not chronological but emotional. It ranges from the world-war to post-war period to now, from Milan to Russia from North Africa to Iran, from Monte Carlos to Sciily where Mattei spent the last day of his life, promising the most-underdevelopment area of Italy the hope of work and well-being. Mattei, 'the oil czar,"" ""the white Communist,"" ""the emperor of the Republic,"" ""the man of disorder"" will attempt to explain himself and his motivating force. The film is open-ended, as open-ended as the history of economic and social progress in Ital, as the history of the third world, the capital, oil revolutions and wars.—Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net>"

It's the early 1940s in small town Ontario. Sixteen year old Jeannie Dougall is slightly dim, naive and lacks any self-confidence, immersing herself in the romantic lives of characters she sees on the movie screen as witnessed by the pictures she has plastered on her bedroom wall. Anything that Jeannie tries that is new or different is usually a result of being egged on by her more experienced best friend, Dolly, who flaunts her burgeoning sexuality. Jeannie lives with her working class parents, Jim and Mary Dougall, Scottish immigrants who live by their conservative and religious beliefs. Jim is a member of the Honor Guard, and has a view that anyone who wears a uniform in service to the country, such as his and Mary's son Jimmie Dougall, is to be admired regardless. Jimmie's non-battle service in Canada is in munitions requisitions. One day, Jeannie announces to her mother that she believes she's pregnant from what was her only sexual encounter to date: being raped by Jimmie's soldier friend Billy when they had a few days leave during the summer. Unlike Dolly, Jeannie didn't have the power or the wherewithal to deal with drunken Billy, and was scared of the aftermath when Billy and Jimmie skulked away in the middle of the night without a word of goodbye due to Billy's act. While Mary has some sympathy for her daughter, Jim, not caring about the details, only sees in his daughter a whore who has brought shame to the family if the truth were ever to emerge, she who cannot ever be married as a wanton woman. What Jim does in dealing with the issue is all in an effort to protect what he sees as his own good name among his friends without any regard for Jeannie's life or her future, she who doesn't truly understand the consequences until she is faced with it directly in real terms.—Huggo A young girl's brother comes home from the army, and brings an army buddy with him.

N. Took the Dice,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067469/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Long before there was any notion of ""remix culture,"" famed French writer Alain Robbe-Grillet created this radical re-imagining of his own feature EDEN AND AFTER (which no doubt to most viewers had already been quite radical enough). In the 1970 original, perverse games amongst student types at a Mondrian-inspired cafe are kicked up a notch when a mysterious older stranger (Pierre Zimmer) appears to offer a hallucinatory ""fear powder."" A young woman (Catherine Jourdan) who ingests it finds herself trapped in a bizarro world of sex, violence and surrealism, first at a maze-like factory, then in Tunisia where youths are subjected to S&M tortures in striking all-white settings. This enigmatic narrative and its outré content are pushed several degrees closer to total madness in N. TOOK THE DICE, which scrambles an already ambiguous chronology to the point of freeform collage. A voiceover narrator provides the only semblance of logic in a mash-up that incorporates not just footage from EDEN but outtakes and new sequences as well. Originally made for French television and never given a commercial release, the film is an arresting pure sensory experience that one is advised not to even try making conventional ""sense"" of. - Dennis Harvey"

The Mooneys are an eccentric English family whom live in a large house in rural England in the early 1900s. The invalid patriarch 'Pa' Mooney (Douglas Phair) is a retired medical doctor who claims to be 199 years old. His eldest daughter, Phoebe (Joan Ogden), more or less cares for him and is head of running the household. His eldest son, Mortimer (Noel Collins), is a businessman whom conducts the finances of the family and contributes to the family income. Younger daughter Monica (Hope Stansbury) is a sadist who keeps live rats as pets and frequently mutilates them and other small animals. Youngest son Malcolm (Berwick Kaler) is a half-wit with animal tendencies in which the family keeps him locked up in a room of the house with live chickens. The family has a secret: they are all werewolves! They are natural born, not made, werewolves whom turn once a month on the night of the full moon and Pa Mooney has been researching for years to find a way to break the family curse. Youngest daughter Diana (Jackie Skarvellis) returns home from medical school with a new husband, a former classmate named Gerald (Ian Innes), which Pa Mooney heartily disapproves of. Pa tells Diana that she is the last hope that the family has to overcome the ancient curse since she is the only member of the family who does not turn into a werewolf on the night of the full moon. Will Diana succeed? However, Diana is revealed to have other plans.—Larry B. Set in England at the turn of the century, the reclusive Mooney family lives in their country estate, where their eccentric behavior frightens the local villagers. One afternoon, two hooligans attack Malcolm Mooney (Berwick Kaler), the most deranged member of the family. Mortimer (Noel Collins) and Phoebe (Joan Ogden), Malcolm's older siblings, rescue Malcolm and, after returning him to his chains, tend to his injuries. Phoebe blames Malcolm's escape on their younger sister, the sadistic, spoiled Monica (Hope Stansbury).When Phoebe pleads with their father, Papa Mooney (Douglas Phair), who although an invalid is a stern patriarch, to reprimand Monica, Papa grows so angry that he collapses and Phoebe must administer one of his live-saving injections. Phoebe discusses Papa with Mortimer, then muses about the upcoming arrival of their youngest sister, Diana (Jackie Skarvelis), and her new husband, Gerald (Ian Innes), whom they have not met. Papa, a former doctor, is furious about Diana's marriage, as he had sent her to medical school in Scotland so that she would be able to continue his experiments, and during lunch, Monica rages that Diana has betrayed her promise to care for Papa.When Diana and Gerald arrive, Mortimer and Phoebe warn Diana that Papa is still angry. Phoebe then urges Papa to be lenient because Diana is not the same as them, but he refuses to talk to Gerald at all. Meanwhile, Diana tries to reassure Gerald that they will be happy, even though he wishes that they had stayed in Scotland. Monica interrupts them and drops hints about Malcolm, forcing Diana to tell Gerald about her abnormal brother, whom they have kept locked up his entire life. When Gerald questions her about Monica's resentment of her, Diana explains that after Papa's first wife died, he married Diana's mother, and even though she died mysteriously after giving birth, Monica has remained jealous of Papa's love for Diana and his late second wife.Diana then sees Papa, who declares that because she is not an ordinary woman, she should not have married until after exhaustive tests had been conducted. Papa orders her to obtain a divorce but Diana refuses, stating that she hopes her love with Gerald will make up for her miserable family life. Papa collapses during their argument, and when Phoebe gives Diana the serum with which to inject him, she is distressed to see how much his dosage increased during her absence. Diana then informs her that Papa will die soon, as a man's heart is not meant to last so long, but Phoebe cries that he must be saved, as he means more to her than to anyone else in the family.After an unsettling dinner, during which Monica throws food at Diana, Diana attempts to soothe Gerald's fears that they will be unhappy there. During the night, however, Gerald is frightened by Malcolm's howling, and other noises, which he does not realize are caused by Phoebe, Mortimer and Monica as they tear apart and eat a live chicken. When Gerald sees the debris left by the Mooney's late-night meal, Phoebe claims that the mess was made by Malcolm, who escaped from his chains. Gerald presses her to convince Diana to return to Scotland, but Phoebe states that Diana must care for Papa, and that the best thing would be for them to divorce. Angry, Gerald declares that he will take Diana away, and Phoebe retorts that Diana had no right to marry. Outside, Diana reveals to a pleased Mortimer that she is pregnant, which she hopes will revive the disintegrating family.In the village, Monica visits disfigured shopkeeper Mr. Macawber, who supplies the rabbits and chickens Malcolm loves. Monica demands a new pet, and Macawber shows her a cage filled with rats, which he has fed only flesh, both human and animal, since they were born. Fascinated, Monica buys the creatures, but at home, one bites her and she kills it. She takes the animals back to Macawber and when he refuses to return her money, she gleefully orders the rats to kill him.Later, Phoebe and Mortimer discuss the upcoming full moon and plan on when to sedate Papa. Mortimer accidentally reveals that Diana is pregnant and Phoebe worries that the child could turn out like Malcolm, and although she hints that there is an unpleasant reason for Malcolm's abnormality, she refuses to disclose it. That afternoon, Diana finds a silversmith/gunsmith (played by an uncredited Andy Milligan) whom she coaxes into making bullets from Gerald's silver cross.Back at the estate, Monica plays outside with her friend, villager Rebecca (Lillian Frith) who lives next door, but when the girl threatens to reveal the Mooney's odd activities if Monica does not remain loyal, the infuriated Monica brutally murders her.Upon her return home, Diana meets with Papa, who again refuses to acknowledge Gerald. When Diana tells him that she is pregnant, however, Papa ecstatically announces that they will begin testing to assure that her baby is born healthy. Papa finally consents to see Gerald, who is astonished when Papa relates that three centuries earlier, his great-grandfather was bitten by a diseased animal and that the family has been cursed ever since. Papa continues that because Diana's mother was of clean blood, Diana is the only Mooney who can marry, although it is still risky to let her have her baby. Contemplating the information, Gerald calculates Papa's age, and the old man confirms that he is 180 years old and that his longevity comes from the serum he developed when he was a doctor.As they are talking, however, the full moon rises and Papa begins to growl. Much to his horror, Gerald finally discovers the Mooneys secret: they are werewolves. Phoebe, Mortimer and Diana rush in with the sedative as Gerald fights off Papa, but Papa dies from the exertion. Crushed, Phoebe confesses that she and Papa loved each other deeply and that she was the one who poisoned Diana's mother out of jealousy. After her revelation, Phoebe also turns into a werewolf, as does Mortimer, but Gerald and Diana manage to escape. In their room, Diana shows Gerald her new pistol and silver bullets, with which her family can be stopped. Meanwhile, Monica and Malcolm have transformed, and after Malcolm kills Monica, he is strangled by Mortimer. Gerald then succeeds in shooting and both killing Phoebe and Mortimer.Afterward, as Gerald and Diana discuss their future, Gerald declares that they will return to Scotland. Diana demurs, however, telling Gerald that she no longer needs him now that he assured the continuation of the Mooney line. Diana then reveals that unlike the rest of her family, she can become a werewolf at will, and after transforming herself, kills her husband.In the final scene set a few months later, the very pregnant Diana relaxes with a neighbor, Mrs. Veschinsky, who praises Diana for recovering so quickly from the shock of discovering her family murdered. As Mrs. Veschinsky mentions baby names, Diana placidly states that she only wants the baby to be healthy."

Deathmaster,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068459/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Quarry is a mysterious, articulate stranger who draws a cult like following of local hippies. Rather than showing them peace and love, he has more sinister plans for them, as he is a vampire. On a deserted beach somewhere near Topanga Canyon in southern California,
a surfer comes upon a coffin-shaped box that has just washed ashore. When he
opens the box, he is aghast at what he sees. He doesn't have time to
contemplate it, however, before he is strangled by a tall, zombielike man with
a misshapen face and an afro hairdo. Barbado [La Sesne Hilton] wordlessly drags the coffin to a
pickup truck, loads it in the bed, and drives into Topanga. Meanwhile, Monk
Reynolds [William Jordan], his girlfriend Esslin [Betty Anne Rees], and the half dozen members of his motorcycle
gang are also tooling into Topanga on their motorbikes. Watching them are
hippies Rona Ashby [Brenda Dickson-Weinberg] and her boyfriend, Pico [Bill Ewing].When Monk starts hassling Pop [John Fiedler], a serape-clad, aging hippie over the price
of his necklaces at his sidewalk display, Pico comes between Pop and Monk. A
few kung fu chops later, and it is obvious that Pico has the upper hand...until
the ""heat"" suddenly appears. Monk and Pico run for the trees, Esslin and Rona
right behind them. Now partners in crime, Pico and Rona invite Monk and Esslin
to come home with them for dinner. Home is an enormous house on a cliff
overlooking the beach. A dozen or so hippies live there, communal style, where
they indulge in the arts, smoke a lot of pot, and sing angstful folk songs
about how a man without a dream is like a willow floating on a stream or a
piece of driftwood rotting on a lonely shore. After an evening of drinking wine
and passing the bong, Monk goes outside to take a whizz and comes upon an empty
coffin hidden in the trees. When he comes face-to-face with Barbado, he takes a
few steps backwards and falls down the hill.A storm suddenly erupts, and the lights go off in the house. A window
blows open, and the wind extinguishes all the candles. By the time the candles
are relit, a stranger has joined them. He sits in the shadows, but it is easy
to see that he is tall, bearded, with long dark hair and piercing eyes. He is
wearing sandals and is dressed like a maharishi. He speaks with an air of
authority about ""being alive"" and finding ""a spark to ignite the fuel within.""
When he claps his hands and the lights come back on, everyone is dually
impressed. The stranger introduces himself as Khorda. When invited to stay for
dinner, Khorda admonishes the unwholesomeness of their food, the filthy
condition of their house, and the importance of cleansing their blood and
eating living food. Only then, he says, will they come alive and be deserving
of their purpose. When Khorda rises to leave, the hippies beg him to stay
because they dig what he has to say and want to hear more. When he finally does
take his leave, Khorda walks toward the door but, rather than go through it,
his body simply fades into nothingness. Groovy, man!The next day, the hippies clean house and stock up on bottled water and
organic food. In the evening, they sit around the fireplace and listen
spellbound to Khorda speak about flowers and eternity. The only one not
grooving on Khorda is Monk. He tells Khorda pointblank that he doesn't buy his
sweet talk and the way he has moved in and taken over the commune. Furthermore,
he's going into town to buy some steak and whiskey, he says, and he wants
Esslin to be ready to split when he gets back. They're going to cut out and
blow this joint, he says. Esslin, however, has no desire to leave. When Khorda
asks to speak to her alone, she willingly goes to him. When Khorda challenges
her to settle for more in her life, she asks him to show her. When Khorda
kisses her, she kisses him back. Then she notices that Khorda is not reflected
in her bedroom mirror and starts to freak out. When Khorda sinks his fangs in
her neck, she begins to scream. By the time Monk gets back to pick up Esslin,
it's too late. Khorda attacks Monk, too.Meanwhile, Esslin's and Monk's screams have carried to the bathrooms where
the hippies are getting ready for bed. When they try to leave the bathrooms to
investigate, they find that they are locked in. When the doors finally unlock
and they amass in the hallway wondering what happened, they see Esslin dancing
to Barbado's conga drum while Khorda watches. Silence overtakes them and, like
zombies, they are drawn into the dance...all except for Pico and Rona. Pico has
realized that something strange is going on. He convinces Rona that they have
to leave. Best to leave separately, he says, so that they are not noticed.
Slowly, they make their way upstairs to get their stuff, but Kirk [Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett] intercepts
Rona and tries to put the bite on her, and Esslin intercepts Pico. When Esslin
bares her fangs at Pico, he runs away, ending up in a cavern of underground
tunnels where he is apprehended by Barbado and chained by the wrists to the
ceiling. Rona also makes it into the tunnels, but when she tries to free Pico,
she is carried away by Barbado.Khorda joins Pico and attempts to talk him into joining with the secret of
eternity, that is, after giving him a pep talk about the things he has seen in
his long life -- the Aramaeans, Julius Csesar, the Crusades, Attila, Bonaparte,
Stalin, Hitler. Pico refuses and, when Khorda walks away, Pico works his wrists
free of the chains and attempts to make his way out of the tunnels. He ends up
in a room containing a coffin in which he is horrifed to find Khorda. Pico
slams the lid closed and backs up, his hand landing in a bowl of leeches which
he has to pry off before he is confronted again by Barbado. Pico draws a cross
on Barbado's cheek using the blood from his hands, Barbado sinks to the ground
in pain, and Pico runs out the door, making his way to Pop's. When he asks Pop
for help, however, Pop doesn't believe a word Pico says and merely gives him a
tranquilizer and tells him to sleep it off.Pop changes his mind, however, when he finds that his dog has been
vampirized, Monk's body is discovered on the bluff overlooking the beach, and
two of the girls from the commune are seen walking zombielike down the street
and wearing necklaces that Pop recognizes as being Druid blood ritual designs
worn for protection by novice vampires who must venture out during the
daylight. That night, Pico and Pop, accompanied by a policeman and a homocide
detective, pay a visit to the commune to ask questions about Monk's death. Of
course, Khorda denies knowing anything about it. When the detective asks
whether Rona is being held against her will, Rona appears and denies it. When
Pico tells how Barbado tied him up and then tries to show the bruises on his
wrists, Khorda's gaze makes them mysteriously disappear.Pico and Pop return to Pop's house and scour his library for information
about vampires. Pop finds a book that talks about an ""incubation period""
between the time a person is bitten by a vampire and actually turns into one.
Because it doesn't say how long the incubation is, Pop agrees that they have to
act immediately before it's too late. They sneak into the commune via the
underground tunnels. As they get closer to the interior, they hear chanting.
Some sort of ritual is taking place, and it looks like Rona is entranced and
about to be sacrificed to the Unholy. As Pico and Pop watch from a balcony,
Khorda bites Rona's neck and fills a cup with her blood, which he then proceeds
to drink.Just then, Pico and Pop are grabbed by Barbado, but Pico breaks free and
leaps over the balcony. He tries to wake up Rona, but she is unresponsive. Once
again, Khorda extends a welcome to Pico and asks him to join the group in
eternity. Once again, Pico refuses, so Khorda sics the vampire hippies on him.
Suddenly, a clock is heard chiming 5 AM, and Khorda heads for his coffin,
leaving Pico to the vampires. Pico eludes them and runs back down into the
tunnels, Barbado in pursuit. Pico grabs a knife from a pile of tools and ropes
it to a door handle. When Barbado comes running after him, Pico slams the door
shut, and the knife impales Barbado. Next, he fashions a stake from a pole of
wood and goes looking for Khorda's coffin.Pico finds the room that holds Khorda's coffin and thrusts the stake right
through the top. A groan is heard. When Pico opens the coffin to peek at his
handiwork, horror of horrors, he has staked Pop through the heart. Khorda steps
out of the shadows, laughing maniacally. Pico tosses the bowl of leeches at
Khorda, and a half dozen or so leeches attach themselves to Khorda's face.
Khorda pulls them off, his face now dripping with blood. Khorda advances on
Pico but, instead, falls on the stake and is destroyed. PIco races upstairs to
save Rona, and finds that all of the vampire hippies have turned to dust,
leaving Rona lying alone on the altar. As Pico leans over Rona, telling her
that she is going to be alright, Rona also crumbles to dust. Pico screams."

Deals with the problems facing a group of women married to men who are missing in Vietnam action. This is a slice-of-life film with each woman representing a different category: Nolan is the mother of four whose husband has been missing for years; Justice is a socialite who refuses to believe, despite strong evidence, that her husband has been killed; and Jackson gives a fine performance as a young woman, married only two weeks before her husband went off to war. He is missing in action, and she has met another man. This is one of the few films about Vietnam's effect on the home front and is certainly one of the only films made while the war was in progress. It also is a stand-out for the number of women involved in production. Silver wrote the story and collaborated on the screenplay.

However, the patriarch of Shahabuddin's family, Hakim Saab (D.K. Sapru) rejects this alliance, as he finds it unacceptable to welcome a Tawaif in his respected family. Dejected, Nargis flees to a nearby cemetery and lives there. Shahabuddin keeps looking for Nargis across all brothels of the town. Ultimately, Nargis dies, giving birth to a daughter.
On her deathbed, she writes Shahabuddin a letter asking him to come for his newborn daughter. Nargis' sister, Nawabjaan (Veena), a brothel madam, finds the Nargis at the cemetery (dead) and then brings her daughter back to the Kotha. She never finds the letter Nargis had written for Shahabuddin as it was kept inside a book that was in her possession. Nawabjaan gives the stuff to a maid to sell off..
When Nargis' book is sold several years later, a book lover finds the letter in her book and posts it. Shahabuddin comes to collect his now adult daughter, Sahibjaan (also played by Meena Kumari). Shahabuddin meets Nawabjaan, who tells Shahabuddin to come the next day to collect his daughter, as for now she has already sat on Mujra. But Nawabjaan takes her niece and flees by train to another town, before Shahabuddin arrives.While traveling by train, a dashing young man enters Sahibjaan's compartment by happenstance. He is struck by her beauty and leaves her a note with the famous lines: ""Aapke Paon Dekhe, Bahut Haseen Hain. Inhein Zameen Par Mat Utariyega... Maile Ho Jaayenge [I saw your feet - they are very beautiful. Please don't step on the ground, as they will get dirty]. Sahibjaan falls in love with this mysterious stranger and yearns to meet him. Nawabjaan and Sahibjaan reach the Kotha in another town, run by Nawabjaan's elder sister. Nawabjaan knows she cannot put Sahibjaan on Mujra anymore and wants a Haveli for refuge. So she decides to purchase a mansion being auctioned by Madame Gauhar Jaan (Nadira), who is neck deep in debt. Meanwhile Nawabjaan's sister also arranges for Sahibjaan to live with Guahar, as her niece, till the threat from Shahabuddin abates.
The note gives Sahibjaan hope even as she avoids unwelcome attention from her patrons (while performing at Gauhar's Kotha) while entertaining them.One particular patron, the aggressive Nawab Zafar Ali Khan (Kamal Kapoor) (from Panipat), wishes to own Sahibjaan (he shoots at the other patrons when Sahibjaan performs at the Kotha of Gauhar Jaan. He later also showers her and Gauhar with the most expensive and exquisite gifts). Sahibjaan is now officially the talk of the town and becomes really famous due to the Nawabs favors on her. Gauhar is too much in debt to refuse the gifts from Zafar and agrees to his terms that Sahibjaan be sent to him for the night.
Zafar takes her to his boat for the night. The boat is attacked by elephants and Sahibjaan is carried away by the fast flowing river in a broken boat. As fate would have it, she is taken to the riverside tent of a forest ranger, Salim Ahmed Khan (Raaj Kumar). Alone with his diary, she reads how he was the same man who had earlier left her a note on her feet, and left for her to read it while traveling in the same compartment. Sahibjaan finally meets the stranger, but feigns amnesia to avoid telling him her true identity. Sahibjaan loves Salim, but is afraid that he identity as a Tawaif will come in the way of Salim accepting her as an equal. Before sunset, Nawabjaan tracks Sahibjaan and brings her back to the Kotha.Sahibjaan is smitten in love and does not perform Mujra when Guahar orders it. Gauhar sells Sahibjaan's virginity to a contractor, but a cobra in Sahibjaan's room protects her and allows her to escape. But her dress is caught on a railway line and she is saved as the train stops in time. Incidentally Salim was travelling on the same train and takes custody of her.Salim takes Sahibjaan to his home. Sahibjaan is accepted by the family, since Salim introduces her as a homeless person, who doesn't remember her own name. Salim's home turns out to be the house of Hakim Saab and his son Shahabuddin.

During this event, Nawabjaan recognizes Shahabuddin and calls him to witness the irony of the situation; his own daughter dancing and entertaining his family. Shahabuddin's father tries to shoot Nawabjaan to silence her, but instead ends up killing Shahabuddin. With his dying breath, Shahabuddin asks Salim to marry Sahibjaan. Finally, Salim's Doli (palanquin) defies all conventions and arrives at Sahibjaan's Kotha, thus fulfilling her wishes and leading to a happy, emotion-charged ending."

the village squire, believes Ralph to be below her station and disapproves
of their relationship, so the lovers take to meeting secretly in the
gardens of the abandoned Old Hall. Although Ralph has plans to buy more
land in order to expand his farm and eventually convince the Squire to
approve of him, Julia doesn't want to wait the five years it might take,
so Ralph suggests that they mark their betrothal by mixing their blood.
They each cut a thumb and press them together. Unfortunately, a drop of
Julia's blood spills onto the gravestone on which they are seated. Because
the grave is one of a suicide, Julia's blood is all it takes to open the
gates of hell and allow one of Satan's disciples to incarnate.Almost immediately, things start happening in the formerly quiet
little village. That very night, Julia is awakened by a face at her
window, but her parents tell her it was just a nightmare. The next day,
when Julia goes to meet Ralph at the Old Hall, she runs into a Stranger [Mike Raven]
who claims to be the newly-returned owner of Old Hall. Fortunately, the
Stranger is sympathetic to Julia and Ralph's predicament and assures them
that they can use the gardens freely. When he later calls at the Squire's
house, however, the Squire likes the tall, dark, and rich Stranger and
gets the idea that he would be a worthy match for Julia. That night, the
village gypsy and the Squire's manservant Mathew [Joe Dunlop] are found dead, and
Mathews' girlfriend Betty [Louise Jameson] is missing. The next day, at Mathew's funeral,
the Parson [Ronald Lacey] warns the villagers that there is evil abroad and points out
that the advent of this evil coincides with the arrival of the Stranger.
When the Parson begins to choke on his own words and the Stranger is seen
laughing at the church door, it appears that the Parson was right.Ralph is worried because he must go to town the next day on the
business of purchasing land, so he attempts to visit Julia, but her mother
informs Ralph that Julia is taking a basket of food to Mathew's mother.
Meanwhile, the Parson is snooping around Old Hall and comes face to face
with the Stranger, who denies knowing anything about Betty's
disappearance. Noticing the big inverted pentagram painted on the
Stranger's door, the Parson decides to seek advice from the Bishop. As the
Parson heads down the path from Old Hall, he meets Julia. The Parson warns
Julia not to go near Old Hall, but she doesn't listen. She runs into the
Stranger who once again assures her that she may have free rein of his
gardens. Continuing on to Mathew's mother's house, Julia runs into Ralph
and is downright rude to him when he asks where she's been. ""You've no
right to cross-question me,"" she scolds and then runs away.While Ralph is away, his twin sister Ruth [Virginia Wetherell] is kidnapped by the
Stranger and strapped to an unholy altar by the missing Betty, now a
zombie, while the Stranger, now looking grey and ashen, prepares to make
Ruth a sacrifice to his master...Satan. ""My task on earth is to supply my
master Satan with an endless line of virgin sacrifices,"" he intones while
holding a knife over Ruth's chest, ""unless I find a maiden willing to
accept her death and spend eternity with me in my dark palace in the
depths of hell. Will you accept and share my destiny?"" When Ruth refuses,
the Stranger plunges the knife into her chest. ""Then die and be my slave!""
he shouts, then cuts out her heart. Her blood is then collected in a
chalice, and the Stranger drinks it.When Ralph returns from town and finds his sister missing, he informs
the Squire who promises to raise the parish to search for her in the
morning. Ralph goes home to sleep but he is awaken by Ruth, now a ghost,
scratching at his window. Ruth leads him to Old Hall where he is surprised
to find Julia with the Stranger. Ralph forces Julia to choose between him
and the Stranger, and she chooses the Stranger. Ralph runs to the Parson
who informs him that the Bishop has recommended they talk with an old
cabbalist named Melchisidech. Together, the Parson and Ralph pay a visit
to Melchisidech [Nicholas Amer], who assures Ralph that Ruth's sisterly love for him has survived her death. To help them combat the Stranger, Melchisidech gives
them a golden talisman and two potions -- holy water and magic sand. He
also warns that they must destroy the jewel that the Stranger wears around
his neck for it contains the drop of blood spilled by Julia as she and
Ralph pledged their troth. Only then will the Stranger's power be broken
and the spirits of his victims be able to rest in peace.Meanwhile, the Stranger has evoked a vampire dwarf [Rusty Goffe] whom he sends out
to stop Ralph and the Parson from returning to the village before he can
conduct the ceremony that will make Julia his bride forever and free him
from his duty to Satan. When the dwarf tries to trap Ralph and the Parson
with a ring of fire, they toss the holy water on the fire, putting it out
completely. When the dwarf increases the flow of a stream into a raging
river, they toss the magic sand into it, and the stream returns to a
trickle. The dwarf continues to pursue them, so the Parson sends Ralph
ahead and stays behind to combat the dwarf. Unfortunately, the dwarf
overpowers the Parson and takes a bite out of his neck.Meanwhile, the Squire has caught Julia packing her nightgown and,
thinking she intends to run away with Ralph, locks her in her bedroom.
When the Stranger figures out that Julia is late for the ceremony, he goes
to fetch her himself. Ralph finds Julia gone and the Squire and his wife
murdered, so he rushes to Old Hall where the ceremony that will tie Julia
to the Stranger's destiny is already underway. Ralph arrives to find Julia
tied to the altar and the Stranger about to plunge the knife into her
chest. Ralph shines the talisman on the Stranger's face, grabs the jewel
from around his neck, and tosses it into the fire. Julia is released and
leaps into Ralph's arms. The Stranger uses the moment to snatch the
talisman from Ralph's hand.P.O.ed that Ralph has destroyed his chance at eternal peace, the
Stranger chains both Ralph and Julia to some contraption that, powered by
Ruth's footsteps, will eventually tear off their arms and legs. Left alone
to their deaths, Ralph cries out to Ruth for help. Ruth's love for her
brother overpowers her zombiness, and she knocks over a candle, which
burns the ropes that bind them. Ralph and Julia escape, but Ruth is burned
to a crisp. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

The clans, united during the Jacobite uprising of 1689, are debating whether to accept William as their new king or honor their oath previously given to the ousted Catholic King James the 2nd who lived in French exile. Some clan chiefs argue they should remain loyal to ousted King James while others argue they should recognize the new English sovereign. In arguing the case for accepting the new monarch, some of the clan chiefs acknowledge the reality of having lost the military initiative during the latest Jacobite rebellion and being too weak to oppose the numerous English armies of King William. They understand that ousted King James is far-away, in French exile, and penniless, most likely unable to raise an army, while King William is already firmly entrenched on the English throne. So, after debating and taking a vote, the clan chiefs decide to support the new monarch, with the honorable condition that exiled King James allows them to do so. Therefore, the clan chiefs send a messenger to France, to seek ex-King's James blessing in allowing the Scottish clans to change their oaths of allegiance to the new monarch. But King William is no fool and he doesn't trust the Scots who are Catholic, like the French, the arch-enemy of Protestant England. Besides, King William cannot forget the trouble the Scots gave him during the latest Jacobite rebellion. William and his court view the Scots as primitive trouble-makers who must be taught a lesson. Therefore, King William gives the clans a strict deadline by which the clans must swear an oath to him or else face war.

After receiving word from exiled King James from France who allows them to submit to the new English monarch, all clans submit, except the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe.

My Brother Has Bad Dreams,1972,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069238/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mentally ill eight-year-old sees his father commit matricide and has flashbacks years later. Karl is a young man in his 20s who lives with his sister, Anna, in a large suburban house near Tampa, Florida (we see the Sunshine Skyway bridge at one point). The opening credits depict him walking home alone carrying a fishing rod. As he reaches the house, he enters and starts talking to his mother, who is not depicted onscreen other than as a figure in a wheelchair. Karl sees a cat in the kitchen and panics, apparently terrified of cats, and grows more and more agitated until he picks up a fire poker and beats his 'mother' to death. She is revealed, however, to be a mannequin in a wheelchair. Anna returns home and discovers the mannequin in pieces on the floor and reacts angrily. It seems this is not the first time Karl has done something like this; Anna speaks to him as if he is a child, explaining that their mother has been dead for many years and admonishing Karl for his bizarre behavior. She orders him to remove the mannequin from the house, as apparently Karl has a strange attachment to them. It comes to light that Karl's and Anna's father beat their mother to death with a fire poker as she sat in the wheelchair, and Karl saw the murder happen. After the crime, the father was convicted and hanged. The mannequins aren't the only bizarre aspect of Karl's interests, and we see him masturbating while spying on Anna while she's nude in her bedroom after a shower. He is plagued by nightmares where strange, terrifying figures surround him and speak to him in unintelligible, taunting voices.Karl goes to a secluded beach and removes his clothes, planning on going swimming, but before he can jump into the water, he is nearly run down by a man on a motorcycle who appears suddenly. This man is Tony, a Vietnam veteran who is traveling the country on his bike. In a strange moment of intimacy, Tony also takes off his clothes and the two of them go swimming together. Tony also teaches Karl how to drive his motorcycle, and Karl is delighted that he has a friend who doesn't treat him like a child. He invites Tony back to the house for dinner, and Anna agrees, although she gives him a somewhat hostile reception. After some verbal sparring, Tony and Anna warm up to one another and there is an obvious attraction between the two of them. This seems to dampen Karl's excitement, as he feels territorial about the both of them.Tony stays on for several days at Anna's insistence, while Karl's behavior continues to become more and more erratic. Like a mischievous child, he spies on Anna and Tony, and he continues to refer to his mother as if she is still alive. Against Anna's wishes, Karl retrieves their mother's wheelchair from the garage and becomes extremely upset when Anna and Tony attempt to remove it. He also keeps a mannequin secretly stashed in his closet, even though Anna has insisted that he get rid of all of them. Karl has an increasing sense of awareness regarding his family situation as well; since their father was convicted and executed for their mother's murder, the locals in their neighborhood are all aware of what happened, including Karl's perpetual immaturity. Anna seems complicit in this, refusing to force Karl to grow up and become self-reliant.Karl cunningly gets some outside perspective on himself from the mail carrier, an older man named Mr. Phillips. He invites Mr. Phillips inside for a cool drink, and then begins to question him about why he speaks as if Karl was a child. Mr. Phillips reveals details of his mother's murder that Karl was not previously aware of, suggesting that Anna was an accomplice in hiding the mother's body after the murder. To Karl, this clarifies Anna's reasons for remaining as Karl's guardian and refusing to take him to a professional who may have been able to help him mature. Triggered by this revelation, Karl gives in to his murderous impulses, coaxing Mr. Phillips to sit in his mother's wheelchair and then bludgeoning him to death with a fire poker, the very thing that Karl's father used to murder Karl's mother. Before Anna and Tony can return home, Karl buries the body in the garden behind the house, narrowly managing to avoid detection when they come home.Unaware that Karl is now dangerously unhinged, Anna and Karl go to bed that night as Karl lies in his bedroom with his mannequin 'girlfriend'. Telling it ""I'll be right back,"" Karl goes to their room and murders them in their sleep. In the morning, he cheerily makes plans to leave the house and strike out on his own, using Tony's motorcycle to escape. The mannequin is with him, the lower half of its body strapped to the bike while the upper half is strapped to Karl's back, in a bizarre appropriation of a human rider facing the rear. As we see footage of him driving away on the bike, a voice over from Karl reads a letter he has left behind for Anna and Tony, as if they are still alive and will find it. The letter explains that he is now free to live his own life, and Karl is clearly happy with this new freedom. However, the bizarre sight of him driving a motorcycle while carrying a mannequin attracts the attention of an officer in a passing police car. A chase begins, ending with Karl escaping and the policeman dead when the car flips over and explodes.Although he seems to have escaped, Karl drives to a bridge and maneuvers the bike down onto a pedestrian walkway right along the side. Stopping over a deep part of the waterway, he tosses each half of the mannequin into the ocean, slashes his own wrists, and leaps into the water after it. Perhaps attracted by the blood gushing from Karl's body, sharks appear immediately and begin to tear the dying young man apart."

Can Seema handle the truth?—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Mohan (Amitabh Bachchan) falls in love with Asha (Mala Sinha). Asha is the daughter of Shiv Dayal (Madan Puri) (who is a peon at a local college). In fact he is a peon at the same college where Asha studies and keeps this a secret. He tells Asha that he wants her to be successful and doesn't want his poverty to be a roadblock to her success. Shiv sees Asha and Mohan together in college and tells Mohan to focus on studies.
Mohan comes to Asha's house to ask for her hand in marriage and realizes that Shiv is Asha's father.. Shiv agrees to the marriage, but wants Mohan to check with his parents. Mohan writes them a letter saying he is marrying Asha and knows they will never accept her.. Mohan mother and her brother are greedy for dowry and know that a peon wont be able to give anything.The marriage is not accepted by Mohan's mother (but his dad (Keshto Mukherjee) is more docile and agreeable). She shows that she is OK with the wedding, but then Mohan leaves for Delhi for his IAS exam. Once Mohan leaves, his mom leaves Asha with Shiv and refuses to take Asha with her to their home.
Asha is pregnant and her father Shiv Dayal, realizing that no man will marry Asha second time, decides to make her a collector.Mohan meanwhile had moved to South India, where he later married Seema (Aruna Irani) as he was informed through his parents that Asha died. They live a happy life with their two children and Seema's father (Nazir Hussain). Mohan's mom died after his 2nd marriage and her brother stole all their family property and lost it in gambling and booze..Mohan works as a clerk in the collector's office (which means he failed the IAS exam). A new collector arrives at the office, and it turns out to be Asha. They tend to work together.. Asha is a strict operator, but treats Mohan with kindness and deference. Asha wears a Mangalsutra and has a kid named Ramesh.. The office is flush with rumors about who the husband is..
Mohan asks for forgiveness for the fraud his family brought on them both. He wants to meet his kid. Asha keeps running into Mohan outside of the office and Mansukh (an office employee) spots them. Mohan goes to Asha's home to meet Ramesh, but is thrown out by Shiv Dayal. Asha is still humble and has lots of respect for Mohan, who is still her husband..Mansukh brings his kid to the office since he is a widower. The kid tears up important papers and thus Asha forbids him from bringing the child into the office. Mansukh (Johnny Walker) is angry and with his friends, he spreads a rumor across stating that there is an affair between Asha and Mohan.
This rumor reaches Seema (Mansukh calls Seema personally) and she is completely disturbed.
Mohan misplaces a critical file, for which he should be dismissed (as it would cause loss of rs 2 Lakhs to the govt). But Asha is torn, as she does not want to boss over Mohan.. at the same time, she cannot overlook the rules applicable in the matter.. She gives Mohan 2 days to find the file.Seema discovers the secret of Mohan's affair with Asha. Seems sends her son, who studies in the same class as Ramesh, to Asha's house to check if Mohan is spending time with Asha..
Office employee Dubey takes bribes and hence is never promoted.

Dubey slips a box of money in Mohan's bag and makes an anonymous phone call to the office manager Jagdish. The Manager calls the police and Mohan is searched in front of Asha, revealing the bag of money with rs 5000. The bag also has the visiting card of the company whole file Mohan had misplaced. Asha orders Mohan's suspension.Mohan is under financial distress, so Asha sends some money via Suresh (Seema's son) to Seema, but she is offended and sends the money right back. As luck would have it Mansukh's son finds the missing file in office, hidden between magazines. The matter is brought to Asha, who immediately re-instates Mohan. Mohan finds that the bribe money (which Asha had given him to deposit in the official treasury), was wrapped in a drawing paper that he had seen in Asha's house. Mohan confronts Asha at her house.. Ashs convinces her that she is not the one wanting revenge against Mohan.After much turmoil, Seema finds out that Asha and Mohan had married 10 year back before her marriage to Mohan (she finds a photo behind the photo of her own wedding to Mohan). Seema thinks that Mohan cheated on her and got married to Asha very recently. She calls Asha and Ashs confirms that she and Mohan are married, but she doesn't listen to her full explanation.

He sets up shelter in a cave and is warily accepted by his new ""neighbors""--the animals who live in the vicinity.—frankfob2@yahoo.com During America's Civil War, wealthy citizens on both sides routinely bought their way out of military service. However, people who avoided military service out of principle, then as now, were rare. History records that one such man was Ashby Gatrell of West Virginia, played here by Martin Sheen. Since West Virginia was a border state, its citizens enlisted on both sides of the conflict. Gatrell was reluctant to kill friends and relatives, as he would have had to do no matter which side he joined. Instead, he spent three years hiding in a cave, occasionally gleaning information about the progress of the war from comments made by passers-by. The whole movie is seen and told from his point of view, and other people are usually only glimpsed.—Mike McAndrew At the outbreak of the Civil War in Doddridge County, in western Virginia, farmer Ashby Gatrell refuses to take part in the conflict, choosing instead to hide out in a riverside cave near his hometown. There he survives alone, fishing and hunting at dusk, keeping well away from the sporadic fighting. One day, hearing distant cannons and gunfire, Ashby follows the sounds and comes upon the final moments of a skirmish. After the clash, Ashby walks among the dead of both the North and the South, and is deeply distressed for the victims of each side. When Union soldiers return to evaluate their losses, Ashby throws himself down next to a body and overhears an officer chastising a soldier for attempting to strip the dead of their valuables. Ashby waits until the soldiers depart, then carries the body of a dead Confederate away to the forest where he digs a grave and prays over the man before burying him.The next afternoon, shots ring out near Ashby as he wanders by the cave, sending him rolling down a hill to hide in the brush. He then listens as a local father and son out hunting discuss the senselessness of the war. Although the father initially claims no allegiances, he soon admits that he would support the South and is annoyed when his son states his preference for the North. The son then mentions Ashby, whose disappearance has been the talk of the town, and expresses amazement that he could have abandoned his wife and young daughter. When the son concludes that Ashby is a traitor and coward, his father cautions him about making harsh judgments and points out that political loyalties have split many local families. When the son admits he does not know if he has the nerve to kill, the father comments that it might take courage to refuse to fight at all.Over the next several weeks as winter approaches, Ashby gathers an increasing amount of fruit, nuts and vegetables to store in the cave. Although armed, Ashby uses his shotgun and pistol sparingly to save ammunition and refrain from attracting attention. One evening as Ashby staggers back to the cave with an armload of kindling, he is greeted by the rumblings of a bear who has settled inside. Angry, Ashby chastises the beast, declaring they had come to an ""agreement"" the previous winter about who had a right to the cave. Lighting a torch, Ashby proceeds into the cave waving it warningly and, although the bear initially gives several threatening roars, it eventually scurries away. As winter settles in,Ashby's sources for food grow increasingly scarce and he is forced to track and kill a deer. The animal supplies Ashby with weeks of food and its skin helps warm the thread-bare Ashby. Through the long, frigid nights, Ashby seeks comfort from his sole book, the Bible, and a worn picture of his wife, Callie. To release his tedium and frustration, Ashby continually works at chiseling his name and the year into the cave walls.Once spring arrives, a galvanized Ashby bathes and shaves carefully and one night walks back to his home. Ashby's hound dog, Blue, tied to the front porch, greets him happily while inside Callie and Ashby's young daughter Sarah lie sleeping. Ashby creeps inside to look at his family longingly, but hurries outside when Callie abruptly awakens. While Ashby hides in the darkness, Callie wanders outside to confide out loud to Blue that despite missing Ashby, she hopes he never returns as she fears he will be killed. Despondent, Ashby returns to the cave and over the next several days falls into despair over his outcast existence. Despite temporary relief provided from eating and smoking ""loco weed,"" Ashby remains dejected. One night, however, in the cold dankness of the cave, a rattlesnake bites him. Terrified, Ashby realizes his strong desire to live and desperately treats the bite while praying fervently. After recovering, Ashby resumes his solitary life, struggling to find food and protect himself against the elements over several more months.One evening, Ashby, drawn to the sound of voices and the smell of food, comes upon several men around a campfire discussing the war. One of the men, a wounded veteran on his way home, describes the horrors of killing and speculates that war cannot last much longer. Ashby returns to his isolation in the cave and as 1865 arrives, he repeatedly assures himself he has made the right choice not to take up arms. One spring afternoon, Ashby eavesdrops on a young couple flirting in the woods and, to his shock, learns from their conversation that the war has ended. When the couple calls out to returning soldiers on the road below, Ashby hears them mention one of his brothers' names and enthusiastically hastens to join them. Pausing on a ridge overlooking the road, Ashby sees only one of his two brothers and, stunned, wonders if the other has died. Confused and frightened about confronting the returning men, Ashby returns to his cave. Later that night, however, ecstatic about the war's end, he destroys his makeshift home and bids farewell to his self-imposed exile. The next morning, Ashby sets off on the road toward town singing a hymn, but upon hearing horses, reverts to his old habit of hiding. In the bushes, Ashby listens as returning Union soldiers discuss the sacrifices made, lives lost and the conviction that they must extend their hands to their defeated enemy as decreed by President Lincoln. The men depart, and, impressed, Ashby comes out of hiding and proceeds home, praising himself for not having killed. Upon reaching his home, however, he finds it empty as well as that of the neighbor's. Hearing distant singing coming from the church, Ashby hurries there, but stricken by doubt and confusion, cannot go inside. Torn by his great desire to reunite with his family and community, but uncertain if they will accept him, Ashby collapses in the dirt and weeps."

But Sonia breaks his heart and marries a older but much wealthier man by the name of Maganbhai. Unable to get Sonia out of his mind, Ajay hangs around her house. Then Sonia is shocked to find that Ajay is wooing her step-daughter, Rekha, right in front of her eyes. She confides in Maganbhai, who hopes that Rekha will marry a young man named Pritam. But Rekha is determined to marry Ajay and any opposition only makes her even more resolute. Then Maganbhai witnesses Ajay with a woman named Lily. Magan must now find out why Ajay continues to follow Sonia around; at the same time get ready to marry Rekha; and carry on having an affair with Lily.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Goldie's main objection to the English version of 'Guide' was the bedroom scene involving Rosy and Raju in the opening five minutes of the film.But his movie 'Double Cross' opens with a steaming hot bed-room scene involving the hero and his girlfriend Sonia( Ranjeeta Thakur) who is in her last session of lovemaking with the hero before she marries Maganbhai ( Madan Puri). If the reader is not able to place Ranjeeta Thakur(Rajeeta) , she was Vidya Sinha's Mumbai friend in 'Rajnigandha'.The penniless hero Ajay Arya ( Goldie) is madly in love with the heroine who opts to break up with the hero to marry a much older but supposedly rich man played by Madan Puri. I say 'supposedly' because he has no money of his own, but he is shining in the reflected glory of a very rich heiress (played by Rekha) who is his ward, and whose custody was given to him by her dying father. After being rejected and snubbed by Ranjeeta Thakur, the hero hits the bottle, becomes unconscious in a bar, gets picked up by a dancer Lily ( Asha Sachdev) who takes him home. She introduces him to a Gangster( a role surprisingly played by David) who trains our hero to be a tough man who then assumes the identity of Jimmy to indulge in the acts of crime like stealing jewelry, and impersonating as income tax inspector to conduct fake raids. The hero is also seen as pursuing the rich heiress, Rekha, who is living with her guardian Madan Puri and his wife Ranjeeta Thakur who want her to marry Pritam, Madan Puri's son from an earlier marriage ( played by Kuljeet Walia - please recall the character actor who played Peter the Mawali in 'Deewar' - can you imagine him as playing Rekha's potential suitor?). After some scenes of misunderstandings between Rekha and the hero, it is revealed that Rekha's boyfriend and Ranjeeta Thakur's ex are two different persons- actually, twin brothers- Ajay and Vijay ( both played by Goldie). After the misunderstanding is cleared Rekha marries Vijay and asks Madan Puri and Ranjeeta to leave her house - who then shift to a chawl where Ranjeeta tells Madan Puri 'you double crossed me, you pretended to be rich, but you are not'. The other avatar of the hero, Ajay, visits the chawl as a churi seller , and offers to sell a nose-pin to Ranjeeta for two hundred rupees. When Ranjeeta is not able to buy it, he says- one day you left me because I didn't have two hundred rupees for your make up kit , today you are so poor that you cannot buy a nose-pin costing just two hundred rupees. Ranjeeta is in tears but it is too late to repair the damage, and Ajay goes back to Lily( Asha Sachdev) who is carrying his child. The climax is rather lame (so unusual for a Goldie movie). Dev Kumar, the gargantuan character actor of seventies, kidnaps Lily and asks Ajay to steal Kohinoor diamond because, in an exhibition in India, the British Government, is displaying it as a special case. Ajay is able to reach the precious stone by outsmarting the security personnel, but has a last minute change of heart, and decides against stealing it. Lobo(Dev Kumar) is not happy with this double cross and it leads to tragic consequences.
The movie was produced by Yash Kohli under the banner of Pashupati Films.It is fast-paced and the narration is engaging mainly because of the tight script and screenplay by Vijay Anand and Suraj Sanim, but the direction of Gogi Anand can at best be rated as average. The combination of Majrooh Sultanpuri and RD Burman gave lovely background music and some catchy tunes like ' Jeevan Bhar Ke Liye Tu Mere Sath Hai' which became popular in early seventies. It was a treat to watch Rekha, Ranjeeta Thakur, and Asha Sachdev who were in their prime at that time, and Goldie was not bad except for his selection of wigs which didn't suit him. His line ' ek taash me chhah ikke nahi hote hain'( there cannot be six aces in a pack of cards), when he is playing cards with Man Mohan in a club, had become rather popular in my school days. The director failed to exploit Ranjeeta Thakur's charm and histrionic abilities ; maybe Rekha was a higher priority."

Politically, Sicily is part of a large Southern Italian kingdom. The much more prosperous and advanced Northern regions are fighting to bring about the union of the whole Italian peninsula under the Savoy royal family, originally governing only the Region of Piedmont and the Island of Sardinia. Garibaldi with a thousand volunteers invades Sicily intending to bring Southern Italy under the Savoy rule. The Sicilian peasants view Garibaldi are the liberator from the tyranny of the landed ruling class rather than the idealistic patriot who wants to bring about Italy's unification. When the news of his imminent arrival reach the village of Bronte, the peasants revolt, looting the landowners houses and warehouses and killing the most hated member of the ruling class. When Garibaldi's lieutenant arrives to formally occupy the town, he is appalled by the violence.
