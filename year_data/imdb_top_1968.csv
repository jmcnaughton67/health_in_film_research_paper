We see her rise to fame as a Ziegfeld girl, subsequent career, and her personal life, particularly her relationship with Nick Arnstein. Early twentieth century New York.Fanny Briceknows that she is a talented comedienne and singer. She also knows that she is not the beauty typical of the stage performers of the day, she with skinny legs and a crooked nose among other physical issues. So she knows she has to use whatever other means to get her break in show business, that break so that she can at least display her talents. With the help of Eddie Ryan who would become her friend, Fanny is able to get a part in a novelty act in a vaudeville show, the renown from which eventually comes to the attention of famed impresarioFlorenz Ziegfeld Jr.Fanny does become one of the Ziegfeld Follies most popular acts, despite she almost getting fired after her first performance by defying Flo's artistic vision for her closing number. Beyond stage success, Fanny also wants a happy personal life, most specifically with the suave Nicky Arnstein, a gambler in every respect of the word. Fanny loves him and loves that he loves her despite her lack of traditional beauty, but she does not love that he comes in and goes out of her life based on his financial standing at any given time and his need to earn that quick buck by the next poker game or high stakes business deal as he feels he needs to play the traditional role of money maker in their relationship on his own terms.—Huggo The vibrant and youngFanny Bricestarts out as a bit player on the New York City vaudeville stage, but works her way up to stardom on Broadway. Valued for her vocal and comedic talents by the renowned theater impresarioFlorenz Ziegfeld Jr., Fanny thrives, but her relationship with her suave, imprisoned businessman husband, Nick Arnstein, is another story.—Jwelch5742"
2001: A Space Odyssey,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After uncovering a mysterious artifact buried beneath the Lunar surface, a spacecraft is sent to Jupiter to find its origins: a spacecraft manned by two men and the supercomputer HAL 9000. ""2001"" is a story of evolution. Sometime in the distant past, someone or something nudged evolution by placing a monolith on Earth (presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well). Evolution then enabled humankind to reach the moon's surface, where yet another monolith is found, one that signals the monolith placers that humankind has evolved that far. Now mankind, assisted by artificial intelligence (such as HAL), must dare to encounter the monolith placers. If successful, the next step in evolution--whatever it is--will be achieved.—Larry Cousins A black monolith affects on humans, focusing on two specific time periods. The first period is four million years ago, at the dawn of man. After the appearance of the monolith, the ape men begin to display behavior unknown before then. The second period is the near future, in the year 2001. Five astronauts are aboard Discovery One, which is on a mission to Jupiter, but at the beginning, they don't know the reason for it. Three of them are in hibernation at the start, preserve the manpower over its entire course, leaving mission commander Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole as the two manning the spacecraft. There is another what is often considered ""sixth"" astronaut on board, HAL 9000--referred to simply as Hal--the artificially-intelligent computer which controls all of the craft's functions, including the systems keeping the three hibernating astronauts alive. Hal is made all the more astronaut-like as it is given an artificial voice, Hal and the astronauts often having conversations. A 9000 series computer is considered infallible, any error one has ever made being human caused. Ultimately, Bowman and Poole believe that Hal is malfunctioning, they are unaware that Hal's behavior is due to knowledge of classified information it has about events at Clavius, a lunar outpost, 18 months earlier. However, the issue between the astronauts and Hal becomes a fight for survival. The mission in its entirety has profound consequences for the human race.—Huggo Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece traces an expedition to the moon, Jupiter and beyond, and imagines the future evolution of humanity. A group of ape-like creatures - primitive humans - discover the use of bones as weapons in a quarrel over a waterhole. Jump forward 1000s of years, and an American expedition finds a mysterious black monolith--an obvious alien artifact--on the Moon. Another expedition is sent to Jupiter, where a second monolith has been discovered. But during the journey the ship's computer, HAL 9000, develops paranoia. This movie is concerned with intelligence as the division between animal and human, then asks a question: what is the next division? Technology is treated as irrelevant to the quest--literally serving as mere vehicles for the human crew and as a shell for the immature HAL entity. The story is told through a montage of impressions, music, and impressive and careful attention to subliminal detail. A very influential film and still a class act.—Robin Kenny <robink@hparc0.aus.hp.com> ToRichard Strauss' tone poem ""Thus Spake Zarathustra,"" the title sequence shows the sun rising behind the Earth, which is behind the moon.The Dawn of ManIn a sere African landscape, a group of ape-like hominids and some tapirs compete for the meagre green plants. A leopard attacks an ape. While one group of apes is drinking at a waterhole, another group approaches; the two groups scream at each other and one party is driven off. At night the apes huddle in fear among the rocks. In the morning a tall, thin, rectangular black monolith stands among the rocks. The apes are excited but touch the object and calm down. (Soundtrack: György Ligeti's ""Requiem."")An ape (Daniel Richter) lifts a femur bone from a skeletal pile and realizes it makes a fine weapon. (Soundtrack: ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" again.) The ape realizes that it can destroy other bones with the club. Three turning points in evolution happen simultaneously: proto-humans learn to kill with weapons, to hunt using weapons and eat meat, and to walk upright. Club-carrying apes approach the group that drove them away from their waterhole. The club-carriers bludgeon the other group's alpha male to death and chase off the rest. The victorious alpha male throws his club and it spins into the air.TMA-1, or the Monolith on the Moon(No title card introduces this section of the film)The spinning bone segues to spaceships above Earth. A Pan-Am space shuttle approaches a large spinning space station, its revolutions mirroring those of the ape's spinning bone. As a single passenger dozes in his seat, a flight attendant with Velcro shoes recovers his floating pen. The shuttle pilots carefully match rotation and steer the shuttle into the station's central docking bay. (Soundtrack: Johann Strauss' Blue Danube waltz.)Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) meets an old friend in the arrivals lounge. They go through a voiceprint security check in which Floyd identifies his destination: the moon. The men chat; Dr. Floyd has a connecting flight in one hour. Floyd calls home from a video payphone booth and talks to his young daughter (Vivian Kubrick), whose birthday is the next day. He's sorry he'll miss her party but asks her what sort of present she wants; she asks for a bush-baby. The cost of the call is $1.70.In the Hilton lounge, Floyd stops to chat with some Russian scientists on their way back to Earth. When Floyd mentions he is going to Clavius, the Russians say no one has had contact with Clavius for 10 days and there are rumors of an epidemic. Floyd says he cannot discuss the matter and goes on his way.A smaller spaceship approaches the moon. A flight attendant serves food trays that consist of many compartments of liquid nourishment labeled with pictures -- carrots, peas, and so on. Floyd sips his meal, talks briefly with one of the flight officers, then contemplates the long list of instructions for the zero-G toilet. He watches the moon approach. The craft lands in a domed landing pad then descends underground to the main complex, once again to Johann Strauss' stately Viennese waltz.Floyd is introduced to a group of people in a conference room. He congratulates them on their discovery. He tries to explain the need for secrecy and the epidemic cover story. Floyd has come to get more facts and write a report for ""the Council.""A shuttle skims over the lunar landscape. Inside, Floyd and two scientists enjoy sandwiches and review the findings. A magnetic object was found and excavated. They're not sure what it is, only that it was deliberately buried four million years ago.At the dig site, a tall, thin, black rectangular monolith -- identical to the one the apes encountered -- is examined by six people in spacesuits. (Soundtrack: György Ligeti's ""Requiem"" again.) As they pose for a photo the object emits a loud, high-pitched noise and the astronauts grab their heads in pain.Jupiter Mission 18 Months LaterA long narrow spacecraft moves through space, its parabolic antennae pointing backwards. In the crew compartment, Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) jogs around the artificial gravity wheel. Along the narrow corridor formed by the edge of the wheel, he runs past work stations, communications equipment, and five large, coffin-like life support chambers with glass covers. Two are unoccupied and three hold white, sarcophagus-shaped pods containing hibernating members of the crew.Frank is joined by Commander Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea). The two men have a meal and watch a BBC news video from earlier that day. The news report is about them and their ship, the Discovery, 80 million miles from Earth. The report mentions the three astronauts who are in hibernation to save air and food; they will be needed at the destination for a survey. The sixth member of the crew is the HAL9000 computer, which can talk and mimic the human brain. The newscaster interviews Dave and Frank together and then speaks to Hal (Douglas Rain), who states he is foolproof and incapable of error.Frank catches some UV rays on a tanning bed and watches a video birthday greeting from his parents. Hal also wishes Frank a happy birthday. Frank and Hal play chess -- Hal wins. Dave sketches and shows his artwork to Hal. The computer expresses some concern about the mission and secrecy. Hal then announces there is a problem with the AE-35 unit and it will fail with 100% certainty within 72 hours. Dave and Frank discuss the problem with Mission Control; they need to ""go EVA"" (outside the ship -- extra-vehicular activity) to replace the unit. Dave goes out in a spherical EVA pod to the parabolic dish antennae in the center of the long ship. He leaves the pod and swaps out the black box from a service panel.Later the two astronauts scan the removed AE-35 unit but can't find any defects. Hal suggests putting it back in service to let it fail. Mission Control believes Hal has made an error because their HAL9000 unit, a twin to the one aboard Discovery, finds no flaw in the AE-35. Hal says that similar problems in the past have always proved not to be his fault (""It can only be attributable to human error"") and denies any chance of computer error. Dave and Frank go to a pod to have a private chat under the ruse of looking at a communications problem.Dave turns off all the pod's communications switches and the two men share their worries about Hal. If the AE-35 unit doesn't fail as predicted, the astronauts decide to disable Hal's higher functions without disturbing the automatic ship control functions, which Dave says will be tricky to do. Dave also wonders how Hal will react, because no 9000 unit has ever been disconnected before. Hal can see the men through the pod's window and reads their lips.This time Frank goes out in the EVA pod. As Frank approaches the dish assembly the pod sneaks up behind him. Suddenly Frank is spinning off into space fumbling for his air hose, which is disconnected, and the pod is drifting in the other direction. As Frank tumbles away, his voluntary movements slow and stop. Dave goes to the pod bay as Hal says he doesn't know what happened. Dave uses a pod to recover Frank's body. While he's away, a computer malfunction alert goes off and the life signs of the three hibernating astronauts flat-line. A display reads ""Life functions terminated."" Hal refuses to open the pod bay doors for Dave, explaining that he knows Dave is planning to disconnect him because he was able to read Frank and Dave's lips when they discussed it. He says the mission is too important to allow humans to jeopardize it. Dave says he'll return to the ship through the airlock; Hal replies that Dave will find that difficult without his helmet -- which, indeed, Dave forgot in his hurry to go after Frank. Hal ends the conversation.Dave releases Frank's body and maneuvers the pod to the emergency airlock hatch. He uses the pod's arms to open the door, then lines up the pod's hatch with the opening. Dave holds his breath and jumps over to the ship, where he's tossed around by escaping air before he's able to close the hatch. Now in a helmet, Dave goes to the computer room and climbs into an access compartment. Hal pleads for himself as Dave pulls crystals from the memory center. Hal's voice gets lower and slower as he sings ""Daisy Bell"" (Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do, I'm half crazy all for the love of you), and fades out as he is completely shut down. (Hal's performance is a nod to a speech synthesis project at Bell Laboratories in which an IBM 704 was programmed to sing the same song.) Suddenly a video screen comes on and plays a recording of Dr. Floyd explaining the secret purpose of the mission: ""This is a prerecorded briefing made prior to your departure and which for security reasons of the highest importance has been known on board during the mission only by your HAL9000 computer. Now that you are in Jupiter's space and the entire crew is revived it can be told to you. Eighteen months ago, the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth was discovered. It was buried 40 feet below the lunar surface near the crater Tycho. Except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery.""Jupiter and Beyond the InfiniteClose to Jupiter, another black monolith floats among the many moons. We hear György Ligeti's ""Requiem"" once again. Bowman leaves the Discovery in another EVA pod. As the monolith and moons align, a psychedelic light show begins and the pod enters a wormhole to the music of Ligeti's ""Atmosphères."" Dave sees a series of oddly-colored landscapes as if he was flying over them. The pod ends up somewhere in time and space in a bedroom with a luminous white floor and furniture in the style of Louis XVI. Dave gets out, now a trembling grey-haired man. Next door in a similarly styled bathroom, Dave looks at himself in a mirror. Back in the bedroom someone is sitting at a table eating. It's Dave again, now much older and dressed in a dark velour robe. Old Dave has a drink of wine; the glass falls to the floor and breaks. Another man lies sleeping on the bed. It is a still older Dave, who stirs and raises an arm. The black monolith appears in the center of the room. Dave is transformed into a fetus in a sac. Floating in space, the large open-eyed fetus -- the Star Child -- gazes at the nearby Earth. Soundtrack: ""Thus Spake Zarathustra."""

Bullitt,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062765/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An all-guts, no-glory San Francisco cop becomes determined to find the underworld kingpin that killed the witness in his protection. San Francisco Police Lieutenant Bullitt's tasked by ambitious Walter Chalmers, to guard Johnny Ross, a Chicago mobster who's about to turn evidence against the organisation. Chalmers wants Ross' safety at all cost, or else Bullitt will pay the consequences.—Huggo Frank Bullitt, a police detective who works for the San Francisco Police Department, is assigned to protect a witness for 40 hours, issued by the ambitious politician, Walter Chambers. Before the night is over,two hit men break into the witness's room and kills him and wounded a police officer. Knowing this, Bullitt gather up information about the incident and opens up a investigation on his own after his police captain gives him the permission to investigate the crime. When Bullitt opens up the investigation, people around start to ponder about his behavior and his antics on pursuing those who are responsible of the crime.—blazesnakes9 Senator Walter Chalmers is aiming to take down mob boss Pete Ross with the help of testimony from the criminal's hothead brother Johnny, who is in protective custody in San Francisco under the watch of police lieutenant Frank Bullitt. When a pair of mob hitmen enter the scene, Bullitt follows their trail through a maze of complications and double-crosses.—Jwelch5742 Lt. Frank Bullitt is selected by Walter Chalmers, a politician with ambition, to guard a Mafia informant. Bullitt's friend and underling is shot and the witness is left at death's door by two hit men who seemed to know exactly where the the witness was hiding. Bullitt begins a search for both the killer and the leak, but he must keep the witness alive long enough to make sure the killers return. Chalmers has no interest in the injured policeman or the killers, only in the hearings that will catapult him into the public eye and wants to shut down Bullitt's investigation.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> It is a Friday night in April 1968 in Chicago. Johnny Ross works with his brother Pete; both are involved with organized crime, and ""the Outfit"" is after Johnny Ross because he siphoned off $2 million of their money. Johnny escapes a mass of gunmen outside his office, then greets Pete in the garage of their office building. The two exchange brotherly greetings and go on their way - Johnny drives past yet another attempt on his life while Pete telephones his higher-up and tells them that Johnny escaped.Saturday afternoon in San Francisco. A man goes to a hotel and asks the desk clerk for a message for ""Johnny Ross"", and seems surprised that no message is there. The man takes a cab and has the driver stop by a phone booth, where the man makes a pair of calls, one of them long-distance. At that point, Sgt. Don Delgetti of the SFPD awakens his partner, Detective Lt. Frank Bullitt, at his apartment. Bullitt has been trying to get some sleep after a case that stretched to 5 AM that morning and grumpily chats with his partner.After showering and getting dressed, Frank Bullitt is driven by Delgetti and another policeman, Sgt. Carl Stanton, to the plush mansion of politician Walter Chalmers, who is entertaining a vast pool of guests at a function. Chalmers tells Frank of a star witness who will testify against the mob - Johnny Ross - and who needs protection through his appearance to testify on Monday morning. Chalmers clearly hopes to use Ross as well as Bullitt to the benefit of his political career, and leaves Frank and his two partners to guard Ross at the Hotel Daniels, a flophouse on the Embarcadero near a highway overpass.Frank, Delgetti, and Stanton meet the man who had inquired about a Johnny Ross letter, and the man is puzzled about Chalmers putting him up in such a cheap hotel. After phoning his boss, Captain Samuel Bennett, Frank arranges three shifts to guard Ross, with Delgetti going first, then Stanton, then Bullitt.Around 1am the following morning Stanton gets a call from the front desk claiming that Chalmers and a friend want to see them. Stanton has the two men wait, then calls Frank, who realizes something is wrong and rushes to the Hotel Daniels. Stanton then notices the door to their room is unchained, just as the two men - one white-haired, elderly, and fairly short, the other dark-haired, wearing glasses, and tall, - kick the door open and shoot both he and Ross. Stanton is hit in the leg, crumples to the floor and is kicked in the face by one of the hit men. Ross is shot in the upper chest, neck and head and is thrown back into the wall next to the bed.Delgetti and ambulances arrive before Frank does, and Frank accompanies Stanton in the ambulance ride to the hospital, where the injured officer describes the gunman, identifies the gun brand (a Winchester pump-action shotgun), and relates that Ross unchained the door, to the puzzlement of Frank.Captain Bennett arrives at the hospital after getting a report on the hotel from the SFPD crime lab, and after getting what he can from Frank warns him that Chalmers is livid upon learning of this fiasco and will try to lay the blame on the department in general and Bullitt in particular. For his part, Bullitt is ready when Chalmers arrives and questions him; Chalmers demands to know how Bullitt fouled up the protection detail and Frank pointedly asks Chalmers about Chalmers' deal with Ross, but the oily politician vows to ruin Frank's career if Ross dies - even to the point of requesting a different doctor be assigned to Ross.A white-haired man - the shotgun killer - appears at the hospital and asks a doctor about a friend of his with a gunshot wound; the doctor tells him that it might be the man on the second floor (Ross), then phones Bullitt. Frank has a policeman guard Ross' room, and when a nurse spots the shotgun killer untaping an ice pick from his leg, Frank chases him through the hospital. Bullitt nearly corners the man in the physical therapy wing in the basement, but the killer eludes him and escapes.More bad news arrives when Ross suddenly goes into respiratory failure and dies. Frank tells the doctor not to confirm Ross' death, as Chalmers will ruin them both. Bullitt also believes that the killers, upon knowing they've succeeded, will disappear; the doctor agrees to misplace Ross' medical chart and Frank has Delgetti take Ross' body under the name John Doe to the coroner's office.While Frank goes home to shower and get some rest, Chalmers, accompanied by a posse of assistants and police Captain Baker, arrives at the hospital and immediately demands to know Ross' location. The supervising nurse tells Chalmers that Ross' file has been misplaced. He telephones Bullitt and gets the runaround, and tells Baker to punish Bullitt for the mishap.Frank and Delgetti, meanwhile, question the Hotel Daniels desk clerk -- he'd been hit & knocked unconscious by the killers. They get a description of the cab Ross arrived in as well as a description of the driver; Frank deduces who drove Ross and rides with the cabbie in question and learns about Ross' phone calls -- the cabbie has a sharp recollection of Ross' stops during the ride & is able to point out that Ross had made a long distance phone call at a phone booth. Frank telephones Eddy, an informant, and they arrange a meeting near Enrico's restaurant, where Eddy tells Frank about the Outfit's pursuit of Ross and what they're after him for.Chalmers, meanwhile, intercepts Captain Bennett while he and his family are going to mass and serves him with a legal writ, duly witnessed by two of Chalmers' aides-de-camp, requiring Bennett to turn in Ross by Monday morning.After being dropped off at his own car at the cabbie's garage - a Ford Mustang - Frank notices that a black Dodge Charger has been following him around the city. He drives around some of the hilly side streets and eludes his pursuers enough to become the pursuer himself. The two mob assassins, realizing they've been outmaneuvered, make a break and a mad high-speed pursuit ensues through the hills of the city and eventually spilling onto a two-lane freeway. The shotgun man finally opens fire on Frank but Frank bumps the Charger as they approach a gas station/repair shop; the Charger flies off the road, plows through the gas station, and explodes as pumps are sheared off, killing both gunmen.Frank and Delgetti are now angrily questioned by Bennett and Baker and Frank reveals Ross' death, and that a check of phone records shows that Ross called a woman, Dorothy Simmons, staying in a San Mateo hotel hours before his death. Bennett holds the legal writ until Monday morning, giving Frank one day to prove the two men killed in the gas station were Ross' killers. He is driven to the San Mateo hotel by his girlfriend Cathy, but he finds the woman dead. Cathy follows Frank into the room, and is horrified by what she sees there. As they drive back to San Francisco, Cathy confronts Frank about his work, expressing a fear that he is becoming as inhuman in his own way as the criminals that he pursues, and wondering what will happen to them.Later, Frank and Delgetti search the victim's luggage and discover a travel brochure for Rome and books of travelers checks worth tens of thousands of dollars, made out to Albert Renick and Dorothy Renick, the latter being the real name of the dead woman. Delgetti calls Chicago to fax their passport applications to the SFPD while Frank gets a fingerprint check on Ross at the coroner's office. The fax printout comes through and Bullitt shows that Chalmers had the wrong man the whole time - the man that the police had been guarding was actually Albert Renick, a used car salesman from Chicago - and realizes that Ross has been playing Chalmers by using Albert as a double, in order for Ross to flee the country on Sunday night.Frank and Delgetti must now comb the San Francisco Airport to find the real Ross while Chalmers, determined to take in the real Ross himself, follows. Renick was originally booked on a flight to Rome, however, after he arrives at the airport, he switches to an earlier flight to London. Frank, going on a hunch when Renick doesn't show at the Rome check-in, gets the airport controllers to order the London plane to return to the terminal, then boards the plane himself to search for Ross, and identifies him by his expression and actions. Ross jumps off the plane through its rear cabin door and runs across the runway, with Frank pursuing. Ross runs back into the terminal as Delgetti arrives with a security guard. Trapped between two automatic doors, Ross tries to shoot his way out and kills a deputy sheriff before Frank shoots Ross dead. Chalmers arrives at the scene and is disgusted that he's lost his star witness, but he leaves without saying a word.Frank returns home, where Cathy is sleeping, and looks at his reflection in the bathroom mirror as he starts to wash his hands. He begins to wonder if she may be right about him becoming as inhuman as the criminals he pursues. He puts his badge on a table and joins her in bed."

Thinking they are alone, the surprise comes when life forms appear, not just as mute human but as apes. Walking, talking apes. The apes see themselves as the original beings on the planet and do anything to keep all humans locked up.—FilmFanUk The film opens with the image of a ship in space. Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston) is at the controls. He's making a log entry about the journey so far. Although nearly six months out from Earth since they took off in 1972; they have traveled 700 years into the future due to their faster than light speed through a wormhole.Taylor takes an injection and enters his stasis chamber to wait out the rest of the voyage with his three fellow astronauts. As he sleeps, the ship continues on before encountering a planet and crashes into a lake. The ship awakens the crew, who immediately realize their situation. One of the four (a young woman) has died in stasis.Suddenly one of the bulkheads collapses and the ship begins to sink. The remaining three crewmen scramble to escape after being unsuccessful in sending a message to Earth. As Taylor leaves the ship he sees the ship's clock showing the year as 3978. They have been in space for over 2,000 years, yet by traveling through a hyperspace wormhole they have aged only about 20 months, with long beards to prove it.The three men, Taylor, Landon (Robert Gunner), Dodge (Jeff Burton) take to a raft and begin paddling to shore. Taylor surmises that they are some 320 light years from Earth on a planet orbiting a star in the Orion system. Landon calls him out on this information claiming Taylor didn't have enough time to read the tapes before their ship sank.Coming ashore they take stock of their situation: they have food and water for three days and a handgun. Taylor tells the others about the clock and proof it offers about the theory of relativity. Landon stops to plant an American flag before moving off.They begin their journey in the rocky desert; around them, unseen figures move across the cliff tops watching their progress. Slowly the country changes, and stray vegetation is seen. Passing an outcrop, they see wooden crosses planted in the ground resembling a borderline fence. Evidence something intelligent lives on the planet.Passing the crosses, they see trees and can hear a waterfall. Realizing they may survive, they take all their clothes off and go for a swim in the lake. Further along on a muddy bank, they find footprints, which seem human. As they investigate, someone steals their clothes. The crew give chase catching fleeting glimpses of humanoids through the thick vegetation.Working their way to a clearing, they find a tribe of native men and women harvesting food from a tree. The humanoids freeze as a bizarre noise echoes over the area; the sound sends the tribe into a stampede. The crew become swept up in the human tide and become part of the rout. Ahead they hear horses and gunfire, the men change direction realizing it is a trap, and they are being hunted by ape-like creatures riding on horses. Landon is knocked unconscious and captured. Dodge is shot and killed. The apes continue to herd the rest of the tribe into various traps, and Taylor is shot in the neck.As quickly as it began, the hunt ends. Dozens of humans have been captured, even more killed and collected as trophies. At a clinic, ape surgeons remove the bullet from Taylor's neck and continue to treat him.Doctor Zira (Kim Hunter), a chimpanzee scientist, wants Taylor kept alive so that experiments on his brain can be conducted. Taylor wakes later to find himself in a cage. Zira visits to see how the captured humans are going. She has given him the nickname 'Bright Eyes'.Taylor tries to communicate but can't speak because of his throat injury. Doctor Zaius (Maurice Evans), the orangutan Minister for Science, arrives at the lab to investigate the latest captured humans. Zira points out 'Bright Eyes' to Zaius, again Taylor fails to communicate. Zira is convinced of his intelligence, but Zaius is not and cautions Zira about her behavioral studies.Taylor discovers that the apes, who can talk, are in control and are divided into a strict caste system: the gorillas as police, military, hunters, and workers; the orangutans as administrators, politicians, lawyers, and religious clerics; and the chimpanzees as intellectuals and scientists. Humans, who are mute, are considered feral vermin and are hunted for sport and either killed outright, enslaved for manual labor, or used for scientific experimentation.Zira gives Taylor a human woman, Nova (Linda Harrison), and she is now assigned to his cage, hoping that she will mate with him. Days pass and Nova tries to bond with Taylor, but his own moral code stops him. Zira, becoming more excited by 'Bright Eyes' each day, invites her fiance, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) to the clinic see the progress she's made.At an outdoor confinement area near a large cage where the humans are kept, Zaius meets Cornelius, who is an archaeologist and planning another expedition into the so-called 'Forbidden Zone' (The vast desert where Taylor and his crew marched overland from their crash site.) to search of artifacts. During the conversation, Taylor attempts to communicate with them by writing a message in the dirt ground, but Nova innocently wipes the marks away. Then a fight between Taylor and another man breaks out. Taylor is removed by the gorilla guards to an isolated cage.Later, Zira gets close to Taylor's cage, and he grabs her note book and pencil. Julius (Buck Kartalian), the gorilla guard, enters the cage to beat up Taylor and retrieves the stolen items. Zira notices that Taylor has written a note that she understands; it says ""My name is Taylor"". Stunned, she speaks to Taylor one-on-one, realizing he really is intelligent.After taking Taylor out of his cage to her office, Zira tries to convince Cornelius of Taylor's origins. He refuses to believe that Taylor is no more than a hoax. Still mute because of his throat injury, Taylor points out a map where the ship went down and describes the journey the crew undertook by writing it down. Cornelius is even more disturbed that any creature could survive in the Forbidden Zone. Taylor takes an interest in Cornelius's work and Zira explains in more detail that Cornelius's theory that the apes evolved from a lower form of life such as the humans. In the Forbidden Zone, Cornelius claims to have discovered artifacts that point to a civilization that predates the current ape society. Zaius arrives and interrupts the discussion and orders Taylor returned to the compound.Later in his cage, Taylor overhears orders that he is to be gelded (castrated). As the gorilla guards prepare him, he escapes into the ape village, first taking refuge in a church during a funeral. Discovered, he again escapes through a market place, then into a museum with various humans that have been stuffed and put on exhibition. There he finds the body of Dodge. Back in the market place, he is surrounded and subdued by apes. Suddenly Taylor discovers his voice has recovered yells, ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!""Back at the medical compound, Nova is removed from Taylor's cage. With his throat completely healed and able to speak again, Taylor reflects on the humor that for the first time he needs someone and she taken away. Over the next few days, Taylor, now alone in his cage, muses about Earth and the life left behind. One day, a group of apes comes in where they collar and restrain Taylor before taking him via a horse-drawn wagon to a large building in the middle of the so-called 'Ape city' which Taylor reads from its name as the 'National Ministry'. In a large assembly hall, Taylor is seated at table where Cornelius and Zira are also seated. It soon becomes apparent to Taylor (and the viewers) that this hearing is actually a trial to decide Taylor's origin and fate. Three orangutans are the judges of the case; they are the President of the Ministry (James Whitmore), Dr. Maximus (Woodrow Parfrey), and Dr. Zaius. Zira and Cornelius have been appointed by the panel of judges to defend him. Taylor tries to speak, and is immediately restrained from doing so by the President of the Ministry who tells Taylor that under ape law, humans have no rights. A speech is given by Dr. Maximus defending the First Article of Faith that only apes should study apes.Dr. Zaius is called to testify where he argues before the court claiming that since Taylor was operated on his throat for his bullet injury, that Dr. Zira 'programmed' his vocal cords so he could appear to speak. Dr. Honorius (James Daly), the orangutan prosecutor, challenges Taylor to explain the Second Article of Faith and why humans have no soul. Taylor states he cannot because he has no knowledge of the ape's society or rules. Taylor then asks Cornelius to read a statement to the tribunal for him. But the tribunal refuses to allow the document to be entered into evidence since it was written by a human. Taylor claims there were other 'talking humans' when they arrived. The tribunal adjourns to inspect the survivors of the hunt.A little later, Taylor is led outside where his collar and restraints are removed and he is allowed to mingle with the group of captured humans that had survived the hunt. Taylor recognizes Landon in the group. He goes to talk to Landon, only to discover a large scar on the side of his head. Taylor realizes that Landon has had most of his brain removed. Taylor physically attacks Zaius for performing a crude lobotomy on his friend, but is restrained before he can do any harm.The tribunal resumes where Dr. Zaius is recalled to testify claiming that the human (Landon) which Taylor pointed out suffered a head injury due to being shot and never could talk. Taylor disrupts the testimony by calling Zaius a liar, but he is again restrained and gagged by the gorilla guards standing beside him.Cornelius steps in and concedes that Taylor could not have come from outer space, but he clearly came from somewhere such as the past. Cornelius goes on to tell how accurately Taylor described the Forbidden Zone to them, and Cornelius's own research shows a civilization predating the apes lived out there as well. The biased orangutan tribunal rejects the theory and counters by charging both Zira and Cornelius with contempt of court and heresy. The court adjourns to consider their fate as well as the fate of Taylor.Afterwords, Dr. Zaius takes Taylor to his private chambers and explains what Taylor's fate will be unless he co-operates. He challenges Taylor to admit where he really came from, but Taylor stands firm claiming to have come from a distant planet where humans are the dominant species. Zaius then admits that he knew Landon could talk, and intentionally had a lobotomy performed on him to prevent him from talking and keeping the knowledge of intelligent humans suppressed from the ape public. Zaius tells Taylor that he believes that Taylor and his ""tribe"" originated from the other side of the Forbidden Zone and worries what they might do in the future. Zaius again tries to make Taylor admit that he comes from a tribe of intelligent humans, but Taylor continues to maintain that he comes from a distant planet in the past. Realizing that Taylor won't budge, Zaius orders the gorilla guards to send Taylor back to the clinical compound.Later, a chimpanzee attendant, who is Zira's socially-rebellious nephew Lucius (Lou Wagner), arrives at the compound to explain to the gorilla guard, Julius, that Taylor is being transferred to the zoo. Julius becomes suspicious and Lucius, with the help of Taylor, subdues him and escapes. Taylor insists on Nova coming on the escape.Taylor and Lucius meet up with Zira who disguises Taylor and takes them across country in a horse-drawn wagon. Later, Cornelius meets up with them bearing fresh horses and supplies. To escape, Cornelius is going to lead the party back into the Forbidden Zone desert to where he found the artifacts a year before. He tells Taylor that only his discovery of the artifacts will prove Zira and him innocent of the heresy charges.They travel across the desert and reach the dig site at a cave overlooking a beach facing a vast ocean. Taylor examines the artifacts that Cornelius has discovered. As they do so, Zaius and a group of gorilla soldiers arrive and a brief fire fight develops before a truce is called by Zaius (under threat of being shot by Taylor). He then tries to negotiate with Cornelius for him to retract his findings and says Cornelius will get off lightly.Ultimately, Taylor negotiates with Zaius that if Cornelius can prove his theory, Zaius will let him off his charges. Zaius agrees, and they enter the cave. Cornelius shows the diggings and explains that the deeper they dig the more advanced the culture seems to be. Zaius brushes off Cornelius's argument as primitive and undeveloped. Finally Cornelius shows Zaius a human doll. Zaius does not understand the significance of the doll and dismisses it. Taylor looks over the other items and identifies what they were. Again, Zaius refuses to believe the evidence. Finally, Nova presses a button on the doll, and it speaks. Taylor challenges him as to why apes would make a human doll that talks.Outside the cave, the firefight erupts again. Lucius is overpowered and captured, but Taylor manages to kill and/or wound a number of the gorilla soldiers before faking an injury to draw Zaius out of the cave. Zaius is trapped, and he is forced again to order his soldiers to retreat. Taylor tells the gorillas he wants food, a horse, and ammunition, and he will let Zaius go free.Taylor challenges the captive Zaius that he knew about the older civilization of humans and covered it up. Zaius admits he did know about it from the ancient writings. Zaius has Cornelius read aloud one of the so-called ""sacred scrolls"" that he keeps with him at all times. The 29th Scroll, 6th Verse written by apes many years earlier as part of their religious hierarchy is as Cornelius reads:""Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him... for he is the harbinger of death.""According to Zaius, the writings of the scrolls give a dire warning about man and the danger he presents. Zaius argues that nothing Taylor has done proves the writings wrong. Zaius then admits that he always knew that an intelligent human like Taylor would show up sooner or later. When Taylor asks Zaius why he hates humans so much that he believes that all humans must be killed to a point of total extinction, Zaius replies that he doesn't really hate humans, but he fears humans. Not for what they are, but for what they were. Zaius claims that man's high intelligence mixed with his need to war... to destroy. Zaius explains that the Forbidden Zone was once a paradise, but it was destroyed by man many hundreds of years ago.When Lucius is released and arrives with the horse and supplies, Taylor continues to argue with Zaius that he is going deeper into the Forbidden Zone to try and understand what happened... to find out how or what brought the previous culture to an end. Zaius warns Taylor that he might not like what he finds out there. Taylor says his goodbyes to Cornelius and Zira and rides on his horse off along the shore with Nova. After Taylor rides off, the gorilla soldiers appear and release Zaius, but he tells them not to chase after Taylor. He instead orders the cave to be destroyed and sealed, and orders his gorillas to arrest Cornelius, Zira, and Lucius, telling the three chimpanzees that he will take them back to Ape City and they will stand trial for heresy after all. Zaius states that he and the ruling ministry will continue to cover up the true origins of humanity. When Zira asks Zaius about what Taylor might find out there in the Forbidden Zone, Zaius replies: ""his destiny.""After riding a distance, Taylor catches sight of something sticking out of the sand on the beach. Overcome with grief, he dismounts from his horse and falls to his knees in the sand of the surf, screaming to the sky. The camera pans out to show the Statue of Liberty half-buried in sand, and in a highly corroded state. He understands now that he has been on Earth the whole time, and Zaius was right. Humanity did destroy itself and apes became the dominant species.""Maniacs!! You finally blew it all up!!!"" Taylor screams in despair. ""God damn you all to hell!""The image fades to black."

The Lion in Winter,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063227/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"1183 A.D.: King Henry II's three sons all want to inherit the throne, but he won't commit to a choice. When he allows his imprisoned wife Eleanor of Aquitaine out for a Christmas visit, they all variously plot to force him into a decision. It's Christmas 1183, and King Henry II (Peter O'Toole) is planning to announce his successor to the throne. The jockeying for the crown, though, is complex. Henry has three sons and wants his boy Prince John (Nigel Terry) to take over. Henry's wife, Queen Eleanor (Katharine Hepburn), has other ideas. She believes their son Prince Richard (Sir Anthony Hopkins) should be King. As the family and various schemers gather for the holiday, each tries to make the indecisive King choose his or her option.—Jwelch5742 1183. Fifty year old King Henry II of England is holding Christmas court in dealing with the issue of who will succeed him on the throne after his ultimate death, he outwardly wanting England to be left in the best hands possible. Arguably the person he has summoned who is the most important in this court is his estranged wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, who he had imprisoned ten years ago in her attempts to overthrow him. While love was questionably never in the picture between husband and wife, there is a fine line in their emotions toward the other of hate and admiration in their sheer tenacity to come out on top. While Henry favors youngest son, now sixteen year old privileged John, to ascend to the throne, Eleanor, who admittedly does not like any of her children, favors oldest surviving son (following the death of Henry ""Jr."") Richard, the determined one to who she had signed temporary stewardship of Aquitaine in her imprisonment. Her choice is largely because he is the least favored by Henry in being the one tied to Eleanor's apron strings in childhood. Lost in the fray is middle son Geoffrey, the scheming one who, like his two brothers, wants to be king one day, sooner than later. Each, behind the scenes, plots to achieve his/her end goals at any cost, especially the downfall of the others in the picture. Thrown into the mix is seventeen year old King Philip II of France, who ascended to the throne following the death of his father, King Louis VII. Outwardly, Philip solely wants Henry to honor the agreement made with Louis for Louis' daughter Alais to become Queen of England - by marrying whoever Henry's heir - or return the sizable dowry that came with that agreement. Philip is well aware that Alais is Henry's latest in a long line of mistresses - Eleanor who throws the most beloved but long deceased mistress Rosamund in Henry's face more often than not - and thus a pawn in the negotiations, she who does not want to leave Henry to marry any of his sons. While he does not really care what happens to Alais, Philip has the end goal of wanting control of both France and England.—Huggo Christmas 1183: An aging and conniving King Henry II (Peter O'Toole) plans a reunion where he hopes to name his successor. He summons the following people for the holiday: his scheming but imprisoned wife, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn); his mistress, Princess Alais (Jane Merrow), whom he wishes to marry; his three sons, Richard (Sir Anthony Hopkins), Geoffrey (John Castle), and John (Nigel Terry), all of whom desire the throne; and the young, but crafty, King Philip of France (Timothy Dalton) (who is also Alais' brother). With the fate of Henry's empire at stake, everybody engages in his or her own brand of deception and treachery to stake his or her claim.—<jgp3553@excite.com> Henry II (Peter O'Toole) and Eleanor (Katharine Hepburn) meet with their three surviving sons at Christmas to decide which of them should become the new King after Henry's death.

The Green Berets,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063035/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Col. Mike Kirby picks two teams of crack Green Berets for a mission in South Vietnam. First off is to build and control a camp that is trying to be taken by the enemy the second mission is to kidnap a North Vietnamese General. U.S. Special Forces troops (""Green Berets"") under the command of Colonel Mike Kirby defend a firebase during the Vietnam war. War correspondent George Beckwith accompanies Kirby and objects to both the war and the means by which it is executed. Kirby's firebase is overrun and his troops fight bravely to retake it. Kirby and a select group of his men are then ordered on a special mission to capture a high-level Viet Cong officer.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> At Fort Bragg, a U.S. Army training camp in North Carolina, cynical newspaper reporter George Beckworth (David Janssen) is at a Special Forces briefing about the American military involvement in the war in Vietnam. The briefing at Gabriel Demonstration Area (named for SGT Jimmy Gabriel, the first ""Green Beret"" soldier killed in Vietnam), includes a demonstration and explanation of the whys and wherefores of participating in the Vietnam War.Skeptical civilians and journalists are told that multinational Communism is what the U.S. is fighting in Vietnam; proof: weapons and equipment, captured from North Vietnamese soldiers and Vietcong guerrillas, manufactured in the Soviet Union, Communist Czechoslovakia, and Communist China. Despite that, Beckworth remains skeptical about the value of intervening in Vietnam's civil war. When asked by Green Beret Colonel Mike Kirby (John Wayne) if he had ever been to Southeast Asia, reporter Beckworth replies that he had not, prompting a discourteous acknowledgment of his opinion. Realizing his own ignorance, Beckworth decides to go in-country to report on what he finds there so he may better his argument that America needs to stop participating by what he sees as a ruthless and unwinnable war.Colonel Kirby is posted to South Vietnam with two handpicked A-Teams of Special Forces troopers. One A-Team is to replace a team at a base camp working with South Vietnamese and Montagnard soldiers while the other A-Team is to form a counter guerrilla Mike force. While selecting his teams, Kirby intercepts a Spc. Petersen (Jim Hutton) from another unit who is scrounging supplies from Kirby's supply depot. Realizing Petersen's skills, Kirby promotes him and brings him onto his SF team. The A team includes Captain MacDaniel (Edward Faulkner), a replacement for Captain Coleman (Jason Evers), Lieutenant Sachs (Frank Koomen), a Savoy 8 team leader, Master Sergeant Muldoon (Aldo Ray), the senior NCO, Sergeant First Class ""Doc"" McGee (Raymond St. Jacques), the teams medical Sergeant, Sergeant First Class Kowalski (Mike Henry), the teams communications specialist, Sergeant Provo (Luke Askew), the team's heavy weapons specialist, Sergeant Watson (Eddy Donno), the teams Mortar crewman, and Sergeant Parks (Rudy Robbins), a man from the Southern United States.Arriving in South Vietnam, they meet Beckworth whom Kirby allows to join them at the base camp where he witnesses the humanitarian aspect (irrigation ditches, bandages, candy for children) of the Special Forces mission. Still, he remains skeptical of the U.S.'s need to be there.Meanwhile, Petersen befriends a young native boy named Ham Chuck (Craig Jue), a war orphan residing at the Special Forces camp who has no family other than his pet dog and the soldiers at the base camp.Also introduced is the ARVN base camp strike force leader Captain Nim (George Takei), who arrives on one rainy day from a patrol with his team after narrowly escaping a Viet Cong ambush in the woods several miles away. Nim was a former Viet Minh officer from Hanoi during the previous war against the French, and is now fighting for the anti-communist South Vietnamese government. He obsesses with Kirby over having to ""kill all the stinking Viet Cong"" to win this war. He also claims to Beckworth that there is a spy network within the camp and ARVN strike force.One night on Coleman's final night of his tour, he spends some time in the Team House, writing a letter, announcing of his return, Beckworth, and several of the A detachments, Sergeant's Provo, Watson, and Lark are playing cards, one member Parks cannot play in the game as his reputation for cons, and luck-playing was well known, Coleman instructs the men to check their guard duty rosters before they turn in to rest, he bids everyone good night and Coleman returns to his own sleeping quarters, not long afterwards, the camp begins to get hit with Viet Cong mortars in a harassment action, the mortar fire strikes the dispensary, ""communication bunker"" and the team house, however the team house is in flames when other soldiers hastened to check on Coleman whom was known to be inside at the time of the attack. However, MacDaniel dispersed nearby soldiers on various assignments to check if they're is any damage done with the communication bunker as well forming a reconnaissance patrol, however Coleman is found dead by Sergeant Provo and a soldier amidst the flaming debris, after Coleman's death MacDaniel informs Colonel Kirby of his demise, Provo observed the fact that Captain Coleman was due to return home the following day.A day or two later, Muldoon and MacDaniel board two UH-1 Huey helicopters for a patrol in the woods west of the camp near the Lao border to draw Viet Cong gunfire from the ground to locate the destroy the enemy. While the two helicopters are flying over a large muddy river, they find a small group of VC and North Vietnamese army regulars building a boat bridge. After taking rifle fire from the enemy Vietnamese, the two helicopters move in and fire rockets at the VC and NVA forces, destroying most of the enemy soldiers as well as the incomplete bridge.One day, Sergeant Muldoon, while supervising a group of U.S. Seabees clearing part of the jungle around the base camp and evacuating the civilians in preparation for a potential Viet Cong attack, notices an ARVN soldier pacing unusually outside the team house and mess hall and slugs him out. Upon interrogation by Captain Nim, the ARVN soldier denies being a Viet Cong spy, until Nim discovers a silver cigarette lighter in the ARVN soldier's possession, which belonged to a Green Beret medical specialist, a friend of Kirby's, recently murdered by the VC. After Beckworth sees Nim beat and torture the Viet Cong suspect to get a confession from him, he confronts Kirby about it. The Colonel justifies the interrogation by telling Beckworth about the cigarette lighter the Viet Cong suspect had and how the VC are ruthless killers who deserve no protection of any kind in this new kind of war.Another few days later, Beckworth accompanies Kirby and his team on a patrol to a local village in the nearby mountains. It is here that Beckworth changes his mind about the American involvement in the Vietnam war after witnessing the aftermath of a Viet Cong terror attack on a nearby Montagnard village in which the young grand-daughter of the village Chief he had befriended earlier, as well as the Chief and most of the male villagers, are tortured and executed by the VC for cooperating with the Americans.Another evening or two later, the Special Forces camp is attacked in a massed nighttime attack by thousands of enemy Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops. Kirby and Muldoon fly out to assess the situation. Their helicopter is shot down by enemy fire, but they are soon rescued by a patrol where they secure a field as a LZ for US and ARVN reinforcements as a 'Mike Force' to aid the besieged camp.Meanwhile, the ferocious North Vietnamese Army attack upon the SF camp continues relentlessly. Beckworth is forced to take a rifle from a fallen ARVN sergeant and fights alongside the Green Berets as well as helping move the local villagers into the camp to protect them from the enemy onslaught.As the battle rages, Ham Chunk's pet dog is killed and the young boy tearfully buries his faithful companion. Symbolically, the boy uses the stick he had used to dig the dog's grave as the tombstone. He is found by Petersen who takes him to safety with the other refugees. As ARVN soldiers rush to their defensive positions, the stick is knocked away, leaving an unmarked grave.At this time, the perimeter of the camp is breached by enemy sappers who blow up holes in the barbed wire fences around the camp, and the Green Berets and ARVN soldiers are forced to fall back to the inner perimeter however though the battle costs the lives of Lieutenant Sachs, Sergeant Sooby, and many Americans and South Vietnamese troops and civilians are killed in the battle. Captain MacDaniel, (Seabee) Lieutenant Jamison, (Patrick Wayne), Sergeant Griffin (Chuck Roberson) are wounded. Provo, however, is mortally gunned down by double agents posing as South Vietnamese soldiers. Nim however sets off the hidden explosives which kill the double agents, Parks however finds Provo hit pretty bad but still alive. Just then, Kirby and Muldoon arrive with the Mike Force reinforcements, supported by a US airstrike in which A-1 Skyraiders drop napalm on the attacking enemy troops with little success. Nim is killed by enemy artillery as he is detonating clay-more mines to kill more attacking enemy soldiers within the camp's lines.By dawn, with the enemy attack still continuing, Kirby orders the troops to fall back and withdraw from the camp which is then taken by the enemy. At a nearby LZ, more US Army helicopters arrive to evacuate the refugees and Petersen puts Ham Chuck on one of the helicopters and promises to return for him in Da Nang. With the base in VC/NVA hands, Kirby orders an airstrike of a C-47 on the camp, which kills more enemy troops forcing them to withdraw later that day. When the enemy departs, Kirby and his team re-occupy the destroyed camp.Afterwords, Kirby has a talk with Beckworth where the reporter admits that he probably will be fired from the newspaper where he works for filing a story supporting the American war. He then thanks Kirby for the experience and returns to Da Nang with the Mike Force reinforcements. Jamison tells that Provo is requesting Colonel Kirby's presence, however Provo starts to almost die of his wounds but tells Kirby to request for his memorial sign name to the public to be known as 'Provo Privy'.After that battle, Beckworth temporarily disappears from the story, while Kirby meets with his superior officer Colonel Morgan (Bruce Cabot) as well as Kirby's ARVN counterpart, Colonel Cai (Jack Soo), where he is told about a top-secret mission they have been planning to kidnap a very important North Vietnamese field commander named General Pha Son Ti who is currently living in North Vietnam. The capture of General Ti is seen as a bargaining chip to ending the war on South Vietnam's terms as well as disrupt the leadership of the Viet Cong. Colonel Cai uses his sister-in-law, a top Vietnamese fashion model named Lin (Irene Tsu), as a honey trap to lure General Ti to a guarded former French colonial mansion located in a well guarded valley deep in North Vietnam.Kirby, Muldoon, Peterson, and a handful of Green Berets, Montagnards (Degar), and ARVN soldiers are selected for this secret mission by Cai, who will be accompanying them. At nightfall, they are airlifted in a C-130 transport and parachuted into the North Vietnam jungle. After Kirby's point man, Kowalski, is killed by a patrol of local enemy militia, all of whom he kills single-highhandedly, the group continues on. Muldoon, the medical specialist Doc McGee, and two of Cai's men are to stay behind at a local bridge over a river to set explosives to blow it up to prevent the team from being chased by the NVA forces.At nightfall, Kirby and the group arrive outside the guarded plantation where they witness the enemy general arrive at his plantation with Lin. After Kirby and Cai and their men kill all the sentries around the mansion, they quietly enter, subdue the enemy general with Lin's help and hoist him outside, where they put him in the trunk of his car. Kirby, Cai, Petersen, Watson, and Lin pack into the car and drive off, but the rest of the team is killed in a hail of bullets by the North Vietnamese guards while attempting to escape.The next morning, the survivors drive over the bridge which is now fully rigged with explosives. Muldoon, Doc McGee, and the other two ARVN soldiers assisting them all escape on motorcycles, but Doc McGee is seriously wounded after being shot in the back by a NVA guard during the escape. The bridge is blown up and the group is reunited in the nearby woods where they dispose of the General's car by pushing it into a nearby lake and successfully airlift the captured General out of the area by a Skyhook device.While Kirby and the group advance through the woods to the LZ for the helicopters to pick them up, Petersen is killed by an enemy booby-trap when he is gorily impaled to a trap of punji sticks. Kirby and his team are forced to leave his dead body behind.Back at Da Nang Air Force base, Beckworth watches as Ham Chuck awaits the return of the helicopters carrying the survivors of the raid. He realizes the toll of the war as Ham Chuck runs crying from helicopter to helicopter, searching for Petersen who is not there. Beckworth then accompanies a group of US soldiers whom have arrived in the country and are sent to the war zone area. Kirby, in a touching moment, walks over to the boy and tells him the sad news. Ham Chuck asks plaintively, ""What will happen to me now?"" Kirby places Petersen's green beret on him and says, ""You let me worry about that, Green Beret. You're what this thing's all about."" The two walk holding hands along the beach into the sunset."

He enjoys playing on the playground with kids. He goes to night school, and his teacher, Mrs. Alice Kinnian (Claire Bloom), asks him to come to a research clinic as part of a study. She takes him through logic tests while scientists watch and film him from behind a 2-way mirror.Charly lives in a small, sparsely furnished upstairs room in the home of his landlady Mrs. Apple (Ruth White), who is both cautious and protective of him; he scrawls each day's plans on a small chalkboard. He works at a bakery, sweeping floors, where he is the target of teasing and practical jokes by his co-workers, led by Gimpy (Edward McNally). Charly doesn't realize they are jokes at his expense.The next day, Alice take Charly back to the laboratory, where he races a mouse named Algernon in solving a maze. Algernon wins, and Charly is baffled - he had his lucky rabbit's foot, too. She drives him home, and asks to see his apartment, which is very plain. His landlady is concerned he's fooling around with her. Alice tells him that Algernon had a special operation that made him smarter, and asks Charly if he would like to have the same operation.Alice discusses Charly's qualifications with the psychologist Dr. Straus (Lilia Skala) and the surgeon Dr. Nemur (Leon Janney).

Charly chats with the lab technician Bert (Dick Van Patten).Charly rides a tour bus to get around and try to learn things. His friends Hank (Barney Martin), Joey (William Dwyer) and Gimpy take him to Paddy's (Dan Morgan) bar, where they play tricks on him.

He yells at Algernon, but Mrs. Apple tells him that having a pet is a gift from God.Charly begins to show improvement, and finally beats Algernon in a maze race. Alice continues to teach him, and Charly begins to fall in love with her. He studies more advanced subjects, and his co-workers try to fool him by having him try to work the bakery machines, but he finds it easier than they had when they started.

Alice tells Dr. Straus that she wants to resign from the program.Charly's maturation continues, and he is fired from the bakery, since his ""friends"" no longer feel comfortable mocking him. Alice explains that growth can be painful. Dr. Nemur wants to continue pushing Charly's education, but Dr. Straus thinks he needs to mature emotionally first.

They have a wonderful vacation and return to the seminar to present the ""Algernon-Gordon"" effect. Doctors Nemur and Straus show Charly's original test footage, as he watches from backstage. When he comes onstage, he answers questions about what is, and what is to be. Charly then turns to the audience and asks what will become of him. No one answers, and Charly tells him that he will return to his previous intelligence - he has discovered the tragic effect on Algernon, and realized more quickly than the scientists that the operation's effect is only temporary. He runs from the seminar, and is haunted by images of how he used to be.Charly winds up at a bar, where a retarded busboy is made fun of by the patrons; after a minor accident provokes laughter, he quiets the room by silently helping the boy. The doctors and Alice argue over what to do about Charly, and he offers to use his vast intelligence to help, trying to use computers and scientific theory to propose a possible solution. But he begins to experience mental blocks, a possible sign of regression. His research is unsuccessful, and Alice asks Charly to marry her. Fearing his quick decline which she would witness, he asks her to leave.Days later, Alice sadly watches Charly playing on the playground again, having completely reverted to his former state, with no apparent memory of what has transpired.The End."

Finian's Rainbow,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062974/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An Irish immigrant and his daughter move into a town in the American South with a magical piece of gold that will change people's lives, including a struggling farmer and African American citizens threatened by a bigoted politician. Of Glocca Morra, Ireland, Finian McLongeran, who has his own unique belief system of Irish legends, uproots himself and his adult daughter, Sharon McLonergan, and heads for the mythical land of Rainbow Valley, Missitucky, USA where he believes he will become rich. One of those beliefs is that burying a crock of gold in Rainbow Valley will make it multiply, due to the power of rainbows and the Valley's close proximity to Fort Knox. Finian considers that he ""borrowed"" the crock of gold he has from the leprechauns of Glocca Morra, which he plans to return once he makes his fortune. Little does he know that in taking the gold, the leprechauns can no longer make wishes come true and are slowly turning mortal. One of those leprechauns, Og, has come to retrieve the crock of gold to save himself and his fellow leprechauns. Finian and Sharon's arrival in Rainbow Valley coincides with the return of the Valley's prodigal son, Woody Mahoney, who has come to repay back taxes before his land is auctioned off. Woody's sister, Susan Mahoney, is referred to by most Susan the Silent, as she has never spoken and communicates primarily through dance. In helping the Mahoneys repay those taxes, Finian only asks for a small parcel of that land for him and Sharon, and mostly for a place to bury the crock of gold. With the rest of the land, Woody and his friend, Howard, a research botanist, plan to revolutionize the tobacco industry by growing the first ever mentholated tobacco plants, which is a little more difficult to accomplish than they initially believe. Much like Finian, Woody plans on getting rich the easy way, in Woody's case off the hard work of Howard. Regardless of Sharon's dislike of what Woody is doing by being what she considers a schemer, the two fall in love. Finian's assistance of Woody in keeping the land irks bigoted Senator Billboard Rawkins, who has been trying to buy up as much land in the Valley as possible. Complications ensue for all involved because of the crock of gold, even though most have not seen it or even know it exists for real.—Huggo A mysterious Irishman, Finian, and his beautiful daughter Sharon, arrive one day in Rainbow Valley, a small Southern town of tobacco sharecroppers in the mythical state of Missitucky. The town has its own resident dreamer, Woody Mahoney, who thinks that he might be able to put the town on the map by crossing mint with tobacco so that it'll grow already mentholated. Finian's come to the town because he's stolen a leprechaun's crock of gold and plans to plant it in the ground so it'll grow faster (or else why would the Americans have rushed to dig the gold out of California only to plant it back in the ground at Fort Knox?). But trouble arrives in the form of Og the leprechaun, who has followed Finian to America and is bent on retrieving his gold. Meanwhile, the bigoted Senator Billboard Rawkins, in an effort to stop progress in his state in the form of a new dam and hydroelectric system, plans to take the remaining parcel of land needed to stop the project - Woody's, which Finian has purchased to save from the auctioneer's gavel. But then the government's geologists reveal to the Senator that gold has been detected on the property! Rawkins and his men confront the sharecroppers to seize their land using as an excuse an obscure law making it a felony for blacks and whites to live together, but when Sharon, outraged at this bigotry, cries out while standing right over the pot of gold, ""I wish to God you were black ..."" all hell breaks loose as wishes come true.—Kathy Li"
Blackbeard's Ghost,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062737/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An unassuming track coach accidentally invokes the spirit of a notorious pirate long believed dead, and who must now team up to lay the pirate to rest, and save a local hotel from a mobster. In this comedy, Sir Peter Ustinov is the famous pirate's ghost that returns to our time. Blackbeard has been cursed by his last wife who was a notorious witch, so that he will never die. The only way to ""break"" the curse is to do (for once in his life) a good act. Is the famous pirate able to do something good?—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Steve Walker (Dean Jones) arrives in a Maryland seacoast town to take the position of track coach at Godolphin, the local college. The night of his arrival coincides with a charity bazaar at the hotel where he will be boarding: Blackbeard's Inn, named after the notorious English pirate Captain Edward Teach, and now run by the elderly descendants of the pirate's crew. The owners are attempting to pay off their mortgage in order to keep the inn from being bought by the local crime boss, Silky Seymour (Joby Baker), who wants to build a casino on the land. In quick succession, Steve discovers his track team's shortcomings and runs afoul of the stiff dean of Godolphin College, its football coach, and Seymour; but he also makes the acquaintance of an attractive Godolphin professor, Jo Anne Baker (Suzanne Pleshette), who is anxious to help the elderly ladies save the Inn.A bidding war with the football coach at the charity auction nets Steve an antique bed warmer, once owned by Blackbeard's wife, Aldetha Teach, who - in addition to being a witch - is also the spitting image of Jo Anne. Inside this bed warmer is hidden a book of magic spells, that had once been the property of Aldetha. Steve recites one on a lark, unintentionally conjuring up the ghost of Captain Blackbeard (Peter Ustinov), who appears as a socially-inappropriate drunkard whose wife cursed him to an existence in limbo since his death in 1718 for all eternity unless he can perform one good deed.Steve and Captain Blackbeard soon learn that the two of them are bound to one another by the power of the spell and only the very reluctant and somewhat eccentric Steve can see or hear the ghost (whom is also coporial and can physically moves things with nobody seeing his physical image). As a result, the increasingly frustrated Steve must deal with the antics of the wayward pirate while attempting to revive Godolphin's track team and form a relationship with Jo Anne.The next evening, Steve gets arrested falsely for drunk driving in his automobile, which was in the control of Blackbeard, who was steering the steering wheel like a pirate ship. As a result of this, as well as causing the cop's motorcycle to crash into a tree, he spends a night in jail, while Blackbeard goes in and out of the cell creating havoc for Steve who begins to lose his sanity among all of this (Steve keeps forgeting that no one, except him, can see or hear Blackbeard and begins to increasingly talk to him in public with everyone around him thinking that Steve has finally lost his sanity... which is only half-true).While in jail, Steve tells Blackbeard what Mrs. Stowcroft mentioned that if Blackbeard did a good deed, the curse would be broken. However, when Steve asks for the treasure that would help save the Daughters of the Buccaneers, in keeping the inn, Blackbeard admits that his hidden treasure no longer exists for he had spent all of the money years before his death, therefore causing Steve to no longer trust Blackbeard.Steve gets released from jail the next day, but he's placed on probation with the college due to this mistaken drunk driving incident and rumors of mental incapacity. The hostile Dean tells Steve that his team has to win the Broxton relays, or he will be finished. Things get more complicated when the pirate steals one of the Inn's mortgage payments and bets it on Steve's track team. Blackbeard's intention is to use his ghostly powers to help Godolphin win the Broxton Relay track meet, and thereby pay the mortgage in full. Though Steve (who is an overly scrupulous man) is at first outraged over the pirate's interference, he eventually decides the greater good is to win the money for the sake of the Inn and help the old ladies, whom he also has grown fond of.During the Broxton Relays, Steve watches helpessly while Blackbeard uses his ghostly powers to help his team win and prevent the other team players from winning. Despite everyone around him thinking that Steve has gone insane (Steve keeps yelling to Blackbeard; telling him not to intervene with the relays when no one else can see or hear Blackbeard), the tean wins the relays. But when Steve goes to collect the winnings, Seymour is revealed to be a sore loser and refuses to pay out the winnings from the bet.The following evening, Steve, with Jo Anne in tow, as well as the unseen Blackbeard, go to Silky Seymour's casino to try to win the money made and Steve accepts the pirate's help in shaking down Seymour. With Blackbeard again using his ghostly powers, he manages to help Steve and Jo Anne with all of the money needed to save the Inn at the craps and roulette tables, and when Seymour's thugs attempt to steal the money rather then let them go, Blackbeard intervenes and beats up Seymour and his thugs allowing Steve and Jo Anne to escape.Finally, with the mortgage paid, Blackbeard has performed his good deed and is released from the curse. In the final scene, Steve finally reveals Blackbeard to the old ladies and Jo Anne on the beach by having them recite the incantation. Blackbeard bids them all a cordial goodbye and departs to join his former crew aboard his ship, leaving Steve and Jo Anne to pursue their future happily together."

She is openly racist, and she makes it clear that she won't do the wild thing with her brother's biker friend, who is black.—Mark Logan <marklo@west.sun.com> Vixen is the nymphomaniac spouse of a bush pilot who owns a fishing lodge in British Columbia. While her husband, Tom, is away, Vixen frolics in the woods with a Canadian Mountie and then returns to the lodge to tease her motorcyclist brother Jud and insult his black friend Niles, a draft dodger from the States.When Tom flies in with a young married couple, Dave and Janet King, Vixen takes immediate advantage of the situation by seducing Dave, midstream, during a fishing expedition. At the same time, Janet attempts to arouse Tom, but she meets with no success. Her frustration is assuaged the next day, however, when Vixen recommends ""a change of pace"" and takes her to bed. Their lovemaking is interrupted when Dave appears, but, rather than being upset, he merely takes over where Vixen has left off.After the apparently happier couple has left, Vixen contents herself with her husband until he is once more forced to leave. She then corners her brother in the shower, unaware that they are being observed through a window by Niles. Sensing that his friend has been stimulated, Jud encourages Niles to pursue Vixen, a feat he undertakes with such zealousness that Vixen is saved from rape only by the unexpected return of Tom.This time he has brought back a bearded Irishman, O'Banion, who has hired Tom to fly him to San Francisco. O'Banion's dealings, however, are only a pretense, for he is actually a Communist who intends to hijack the plane to Cuba--and quickly sensing that the young draft dodger might be a willing accomplice, he persuades Niles to join Tom and Vixen on the flight. Once aloft, Vixen has a heated argument with Niles and is instrumental in getting him to help thwart O'Banion's hijacking scheme. When the plane lands in the States, O'Banion is turned over to the authorities, and Niles decides to remain there as it is ""the lesser of two evils."""
Once Upon a Time in the West,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064116/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mysterious stranger with a harmonica joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad. Story of a young woman, Mrs. McBain, who moves from New Orleans to frontier Utah, on the very edge of the American West. She arrives to find her new husband and family slaughtered, but by whom? The prime suspect, coffee-lover Cheyenne, befriends her and offers to go after the real killer, assassin gang leader Frank, in her honor. He is accompanied by Harmonica, a man already on a quest to get even.—DrGoodBeat / edited by statmanjeff The sprawling railways are reaching the far west, and somewhere along its way, in a small border town, the paths of four characters will cross and clash: a young woman looking for a fresh start, an outlaw on the run for a crime he didn't commit (this time), a ruthless killer on the payroll of a railroad tycoon, and a mysterious man with no name who plays a couple of sad chords on a harmonica and a few cadences on his revolver.—Azeitonascomchantili The beautiful Jill McBain, married in New Orleans a month ago, arrives at her new husband's place to find him and his children dead. Also new to the area, a man known only as Harmonica (met by three gunmen whom he soon dispatches). All of the men, those at the McBains and the train depot, wore long coats, a trademark of local bandit Cheyenne and his gang, but it's Frank, who works for a railroad baron, who wants McBain's land and is trying to frame Cheyenne for the killing. Harmonica has his own reasons for seeking Frank, leading to a showdown.—garykmcd / edited by statmanjeff A young woman leaves her old life behind for her new husband and a new future out West. When her train arrives, she finds that he and his children have been murdered. A man known only as Harmonica knows Frank did it and goes after him. Just then, another outlaw, Cheyenne, appears intent on tracking down Frank. As good pursuit of Frank gets closer to him, Cheyenne leaves none of Frank's associates alive.—J. S. Golden In the desert Southwest of America during the waning days of the Old West, three gunmen (Jack Elam,Woody Strode,Al Mulock) approach an isolated train depot; two are wearing duster overcoats. The men take over the station and settle in to wait for the train. When the train finally comes, a nameless harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) gets off and asks for someone named Frank. They tell him Frank sent them in his place. In the ensuing showdown, all four men go down. Only the man with the harmonica gets up again.The soundtrack to the opening scene is a creative orchestration of ordinary sounds in the style of John Cage. ComposerEnnio Morriconeuses dripping water, the clicking of a telegraph, a buzzing fly, and over all the persistent, annoying squeak of a windmill-powered pump to build tension, punctuate visual jokes, and emphasize the tedium of waiting for the train. The scant dialog allows the soundtrack to consume much more of our attention than a score usually does.On a remote farm called Sweetwater, Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his children are preparing an outdoor wedding feast. McBain tells his son Patrick to drive into town to pick up his new mother, who is arriving by train from New Orleans. Suddenly shots ring out from the desert, and McBain's daughter Maureen, son Patrick, and McBain himself are slain. The youngest McBain, Timmy, runs out of the house to find that his entire family has been destroyed. He watches in terrified silence as a group of five gunmen in duster overcoats emerge from the scrub brush. When one of the men calls their leader Frank by name, asking what to do with the child, Frank (Henry Fonda) draws his pistol and slowly takes aim at the last remaining witness. With a self-satisfied grin, he pulls the trigger.In the town of Flagstone, McBain's bride Jill (Claudia Cardinale) steps down from the train to find that no one is there to meet her. Giving up hope, she steps through the train station into the bustling new town still being built. She hires a carriage to drive her to Sweetwater. The farm's name draws laughter from the driver, Sam (Paolo Stoppa), who informs her that ""Sweetwater"" is a worthless piece of ground, and McBain is crazy for trying to farm it.Along the way, Sam speeds through a group of railroad workers busily laying their ""damn rails."" Then he stops at a wayside inn/tavern/trading post, and Jill follows him inside. Her beauty draws the unwelcome attentions of the barman (Lionel Stander). After a noisy off-screen gun battle, the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) enters wearing shackles on his wrists. The sounds of a harmonica again reveals the presence of the nameless stranger, who has been watching from a dark corner of the tavern. Cheyenne dubs him ""Harmonica,"" and he uses Harmonica's gun to force another patron to shoot apart the chain between his wrists. Cheyenne's men soon arrive, too late to help him escape the prison guards who now lie dead outside. Harmonica notes that the three men he killed earlier were wearing the same duster overcoats as Cheyenne's men, and Cheyenne is annoyed that rivals may be copying his trademark dusters.Jill and Sam arrive at Sweetwater to find a crowd of somber wedding guests standing around the outdoor tables, now put to use as funeral biers. Jill is horrified at the carnage. When one of the women bemoans that this should happen to the ""poor little miss"" on her wedding day, Jill informs the guests that she and Brett McBain were married a month earlier in New Orleans. As the burial comes to an end, the crowd discovers that the torn-off collar of a duster overcoat was found on a nail by the door. This marks the massacre as Cheyenne's work. The men form a posse and ride off to track down the outlaw and hang him. Sam offers to drive Jill back to Flagstone, but she says she will stay at Sweetwater. That evening, she ransacks the McBain household, looking for anything of value that might have been hidden away.At the town laundry in Flagstone that night, Harmonica puts the laundry man Wobbles through a violent interrogation, wanting to know why Frank didn't show up at the train. Wobbles doesn't know; he only arranged the meeting. Harmonica suspects Frank was occupied at McBain's farm just then, but Wobbles insists otherwise: ""Cheyenne did that job--everyone knows that. We got proof."" Harmonica doesn't believe it: ""That was always one of Frank's tricks--faking' evidence.""Jill finds a group of miniature buildings stored away in a trunk, including a model train station with a fancy swinging sign that says ""STATION."" She hears the sound of a harmonica outside and fires a shotgun into the darkness. The sound of the harmonica moves farther away. In the morning as she is about to leave for good, she finds Cheyenne on her doorstep. While his men wait outside, he barges in and asks for coffee. He tells of being chased by the posse all night and helps make the fire for the coffee. He says he would never kill a kid: ""I ain't the mean bastard people make out."" He decided to come take a look at the scene of his supposed crime. Not only is he annoyed that someone is trying to blame him, but neither he nor Jill can understand why the killings happened at all. The place looks so worthless, he imagines that McBain must have hidden a treasure away somewhere. Jill tells him that if so, she couldn't find it. Aware that she is vulnerable to any sort of mistreatment Cheyenne and his men might deal out, she serves the coffee.In a private railroad car, Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti), a crippled and dying railroad tycoon, berates Frank for killing the McBains. He only wanted Frank to scare McBain, not kill him. And now a Mrs. McBain has shown up, making the killings pointless. Morton began building his railroad in sight of the Atlantic Ocean, and he means to build his way to the Pacific before he dies. He hired Frank to ""remove small obstacles from the tracks,"" but Frank intends to become a wealthy businessman himself. Morton tells Frank he will never be like Morton, because Frank doesn't understand that money is more powerful than guns.After having sex with Jill, Cheyenne finishes his coffee and rides away with his men. Jill takes her traveling bags out to the wagon. But Harmonica is there and demands that she stay. As he throws her down roughly and begins ripping at her clothes, Jill becomes alarmed. Instead of harming her, he simply removes the white trimmings from her black dress, leaving her in full mourning. They go to the well for a drink of water, only to be attacked by two more of Frank's men. Harmonica kills them, and from a nearby vantage point Cheyenne sees how handy Harmonica is with a gun.Jill goes to the laundry and asks Wobbles to tell Frank she knows everything and wants to negotiate with Frank personally. Wobbles denies knowing anyone named Frank, but Jill repeats her demand and leaves. Wobbles heads out to Morton's private train, unaware that Harmonica is following him. Morton scolds him for coming there, but Wobbles says he wasn't followed, and he thought Morton and Frank would want to know about Mrs. McBain. When Frank sees Harmonica's shadow on the ground, he knows someone is on the roof, and he signals the train to start moving.Stopping in open country, Frank captures Harmonica. A blurry flashback appears of an indistinct man walking through a desert landscape, but no explanation is given). Frank has Harmonica brought on board and bound. He kicks Wobbles off the train (literally) and shoots him down just as Wobbles is about to reveal the presence of Cheyenne hiding in the train's undercarriage. Harmonica lets Frank know that the two men he sent to kill Jill are themselves dead. Realizing this is the man who wanted to meet with him, Frank asks Harmonica who he is. Harmonica answers with the names of two men Frank has killed. Morton interrupts the interrogation to remind Frank he has more urgent business: the woman. Taking to horseback, Frank rides away with three of his men to do away with Mrs. McBain himself. He leaves three men behind on the train to guard Harmonica and keep an eye on Morton, whom he doesn't trust. Frank tells the men to meet him at the Navajo cliff, and the train gets under way again. Over the next few minutes, Cheyenne craftily disposes of the three gunmen one by one and sets Harmonica free. They now have Morton in their power, but they will deal with him later, choosing to stop the train and ride to Jill's aid.At Sweetwater, Jill is puzzled by the arrival of a large amount of lumber and building supplies that McBain ordered. Since he paid cash, it all belongs to her. Neither the lumberman nor Sam can say what it's for, but there are enough materials to build at least eight buildings. When the lumberman shows her a blank sign and asks if she knows what should go on it, she recognizes its outline from the miniature train station and tells him it should say ""STATION."" Inside the house, she looks through the trunk again for the model train station. Just then, Frank captures her.At the Navajo cliff, Morton offers to buy Sweetwater to avoid more killing--he's had enough of Frank's butcher tactics. He doesn't have time to compete with Frank. But away from his train, Morton looks weak and pathetic, no competition at all as far as Frank is concerned. Frank kicks one of his crutches out from under him, sending Morton sprawling face first: ""I could squash you like a wormy apple."" Frank tells some of his men to take Morton back to his train and watch him.At Sweetwater, Cheyenne and his men are just as puzzled by the building supplies as Jill is. Harmonica paces off the dimensions of a train station while explaining to Cheyenne what he has seen in a document: McBain was planning to build a town at Sweetwater, which has the only water supply for fifty miles west of Flagstone. Since trains need lots of water for their boilers, the railroad must inevitably come through Sweetwater. McBain contracted for the rights to operate the depot himself, provided it was built by the time the tracks reached it. Knowing that the rail gangs are just over the hill, Cheyenne puts his men to work building the station.Inside a ruin at the Navajo cliff, Frank enjoys sex with his captive Jill. He remarks that she will do anything to stay alive and that it seems she can't resist a man's touch, even the touch of the man who killed her husband. Frank knows from inquiries sent over the telegraph that Jill was one of the most popular prostitutes in New Orleans until she married McBain. As he undresses her, he thinks of marrying her himself to take over the land. Realizing he would make a bad husband, he comes up with a quicker, simpler solution.Jill sits in quiet resignation in the saloon at Flagstone, where people have gathered for a land auction. One of Frank's men hovers over her, and several more are scattered through the crowd, ready to intimidate anyone who even starts to make a bid. It's Frank's way of getting the property for himself cheaply. The sheriff (Keenan Wynn) reluctantly gets the auction under way.Meanwhile Morton, aboard his train, senses that his dream of seeing the Pacific is growing remote. He joins a game of poker with four of Frank's men who are now his captors. Instead of dealing out cards, he deals out five hundred dollars to each of the men to buy their allegiance to him.Back at the land auction, one of Frank's still-loyal men bids five hundred dollars for the farm. Just as the sheriff is about to close the sale, Harmonica calls out a bid of five thousand dollars. In what is most likely a scheme devised by both men, Harmonica brings in an indignant Cheyenne at gunpoint and turns him in for the reward money to cover his bid. The sheriff puts Cheyenne under guard on the train bound to Yuma, where there is a new, strong, modern prison that is much more secure than the local jail. But two of Cheyenne's men follow him onto the train after buying one-way tickets to the next station. Meanwhile, one of the men on Morton's train rides into town to tell the others what transpired in the poker game.Jill is grateful that Harmonica has saved the farm for her, and she begins to look at him more warmly. Frank enters the saloon and offers Harmonica five thousand dollars for the farm, plus one silver dollar profit. Again he asks Harmonica's name, and Harmonica answers with the names of two more dead men: ""They were all alive until they met you, Frank."" Again the blurred flashback appears, but the image of Frank walking through the desert becomes clearer than before. Harmonica rejects the offer but uses Frank's silver dollar to pay for his drink. Having noticed suspicious activity outside, Harmonica goes to watch from the upstairs windows and balcony, breaking into the room where Jill is taking a steamy bath. Frank steps out of the saloon onto the street--and into a deadly cat-and-mouse game. His former men, now Morton's men, try to gun him down. But with some timely assistance from Harmonica, Frank manages to kill them instead and rides out. Jill is furious at Harmonica for saving Frank's life. He tells her, ""I didn't let them kill him and that's not the same thing.""Frank discovers the aftermath of a gun battle at Morton's train. Bodies of Frank's men and Cheyenne's men lie strewn along the tracks and in Morton's private car. He finds Morton crawling desperately to a nearby mud puddle. Frank draws and cocks his gun to finish him off but then decides to let him suffer. Morton dies with the sound of ocean waves crashing in his mind.The track laying crew is reaching Sweetwater at last, and construction crew are busily turning the stacks of lumber into the beginnings of a town. Harmonica sits at the farmyard gate as Cheyenne comes riding awkwardly in and goes inside. Not quite his usual self, he again asks for coffee, which Jill has ready this time. They both sense that outside something important is about to happen with Harmonica. Cheyenne: ""He's whittling' on a piece of wood. I got a feeling' when he stops whittling', something's gonna happen.""Frank rides up to the gate, and Harmonica stops whittling. They exchange a few words. Frank admits he'll never be a businessman: ""Just a man."" They acknowledge they're of an ancient race being killed off by the coming of the modern age--arriving right next to them as they speak. Then Frank gets to the business between them: ""The future don't matter to us. Nothin' matters now--not the land, not the money, not the woman. I came here to see you. 'Cause I know that now you'll tell me what you're after.""""Only at the point of dying',"" Harmonica tells him. Frank says, ""I know,"" and they stride out into the farmyard to face off for the final showdown.Inside, Cheyenne begins to clean up and shave while he watches the railroad move up. He tells Jill she should take water out to the workers at the tracks, letting them enjoy the sight of a beautiful woman. And if one of them should pat her behind, she should just make believe it's nothing. They earned it.As Frank and Harmonica square up a few feet apart, preparing to duel, Harmonica remembers his history with Frank, in the flashback, a young Frank strides out of the desert to the isolated ruin of a Spanish mission--a lone arch with a bell hanging at the top. He places a brand-new harmonica into a young man's mouth, telling him to keep his loving' brother happy. The youth's hands are bound behind him, and his older brother, also bound, is standing on his shoulders with a noose around his neck. Frank and his men wait for the inevitable moment when the boy's legs will give way and complete the hanging. The doomed man curses Frank and kicks his younger brother away. The harmonica drops out of the young man's mouth as he falls into the dust.Frank and Harmonica draw and shoot. Frank turns around and staggers a few steps before he falls to the his knees. He asks Harmonica again, ""Who ... who are you?"" In answer, Harmonica places the old, beaten-up harmonica into Frank's mouth. Frank's remembers--he sees the image of the boy falling into the dust and the harmonica dropping out of his mouth. Frank falls lifelessly into the dust and the harmonica drops out of his mouth.Cheyenne tells Jill he's not the right man for her, but neither is Harmonica. There's something inside a man like that, he tells her, something to do with death. Once Harmonica has dealt with Frank, he will come inside, pick up his things and move on.Harmonica comes in and, true to Cheyenne's prediction, picks up his belongings and tells Jill he has to go. Jill is wearing a dress whose top reveals her cleavage. They share a lingering look, and then he opens the front door and surveys the developing street scene outside. ""It's going to be a beautiful town, Sweetwater,"" he says. Jill hopes he will come back someday. With a doubtful ""Someday,"" Harmonica leaves. Cheyenne too says goodbye and pats Jill on the behind, telling her to make believe it's nothing.As the two men ride away, Cheyenne pauses and gets off his horse before dropping to the ground. Harmonica discovers that Cheyenne has been gut-shot, the work of Morton himself during the gun battle at the train. Cheyenne asks Harmonica to go away--he doesn't want Harmonica to see him die. Harmonica turns away and soon hears Cheyenne fall over dead. Just then, the work train rolls into Sweetwater and stops at the station, which has its ""STATION"" sign in place. Harmonica takes Cheyenne's body away as Jill carries water out to the newly arrived railroad workers."

That reluctance is heightened when the car does things outside of his control, which makes him believe it defective.

Pepperland is inhabited by a group of music lovers who dwell in peace and harmony. The peace of Pepperland is threatened by an attack of the Blue Meanies, who hate all music and beauty. Their attack freezes the inhabitants of Pepperland and destroys all of their art and natural beauty. One inhabitant of Pepperland is the uniformed Fred, who is named Admiral by the Lord Mayor and sent off in Pepperland's Yellow Submarine to seek help in the surface world. Young Fred, as he is called by the ancient Lord Mayor, escapes just in time as the mayor is Bonked by the attacking Blue Meanies.(Song:Yellow Submarine) over creditsFred arrives in Liverpool, England and spies upon a lonely Ringo (Song: Elanor Rigby) and follows him home in the submarine. Ringo is made confused and nervous by the sneaky sub and fails to find help from a Bobby (policeman). Fred knocks on Ringo's door, explains the plight of Pepperland and asks him for help. Fred enters the cavernous, weird mansion labled The Pier then is picked up in Ringo's car. Ringo is sympathetic but wants to ask the others, so they start to look for Ringo's mates. They first meet the Frankenstein Monster who turns into John, the leader of the Beatles. They find George meditating atop a mountain in the next room, yet also driving in Ringo's car. ""its all in the mind"" explains George helpfully. Finally, Paul appears from one of the mansion's many doors from an adoring crowd. The Beatles decide to help Old Fred as they have christened him. They depart immediately aboard the Yellow Submarine.Non-animated montage of various scenes of London and the English countryside speed by, giving the illusion of flying as the submarine takes off. (The creshendo of music is from the song ""A Day in the Life"". )The Beatles learn the workings of the submarine from Old Fred (Song: All Together Now) as they go beneath the waves. They sail into the Sea of Time and become very young and then very old Senile Delinquents (Song: When Im Sixty Four). They leave the Sea of Time and enter the Sea of Science. (Song: Only a Northern Song).Finally they arrive in the Sea of Monsters, where a throng of bizarre creatures dwell, some of whom threaten the submarine. But disaster is always averted by the pressing of a random button. That is, until Ringo hits the Panic Button and is hurled onto the back of a galloping monster. The rest of the Beatles manage to rescue him, but soon after they are swallowed by the dreaded Vacuum Thrask. The Thrask then swallows the entire sea of monsters. The Thrask has nothing left to suck up until it notices its own tail. It sucks up the tail and disappears up its own existence. Luckily, this causes the Yellow Submarine to be thrown clear.The Submarine motor has malfunctioned and they come to rest in the blank nothingness that is Nowhere Land. The Beatles notice that there is an inhabitant here, the tiny, poetry spouting Nowhere Man. He introduces himself as Jeremy Hillary Boob, Phd. Jeremy fixes the motor and goes back to his meaningless activities. (Song: Nowhere Man) Ringo feels sorry for Jeremy and invites him aboard.They sail for a while, but the submarine conks out again. The Beatles and Jeremy get out to try and repair the ship. Jeremy fixes the screw with bubble gum, but this causes the Yellow Submarine to take off with Old Fred and leaves the rest stranded. They realize that they are in the Foothills of the Headlands. John questions the heads and meets a lady friend. (Song: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds). They realize that they must be near Pepperland since the ground is covered with pepper. The pepper causes the heads to sneeze, blowing our friends all the way to the Sea of Holes. They remember Old Fred told them that the way to Pepperland was via the Sea of Holes to the Sea of Green. They search the holes and Ringo puts a hole in his pocket. Jeremy is kidnapped by a lurking Blue Meanie while the others are searching for a way out. Finally, they find the Sea of Green and end up in Pepperland just as Old Fred arrives in the Yellow Submarine.Old Fred suggests that the Lord Mayor can be revived by music, and the Beatles hum a tune and the Lord Mayor is UnBonked. The mayor notices that the Beatles strongly resemble Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He suggests that they disguise themselves as the band and rally the land to rebellion. Since their instruments were lost in the Sea of Monsters, they sneak past the sleeping Blue Meanies to the Bandstand where all of the musical instruments are being held.They find instruments, and band uniforms belonging to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They hide until dawn and make their escape. They are almost caught when George steps on a bagpipe, but they escape and begin to rally and unfreeze the people of Pepperland. (Songs: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and part of A Little Help From My Friends).The Beatles then dispatch a group of giant Blue Meanies called Apple Bonkers by standing on each other's shoulders and bonking the giants and their Blue Meanie Sergeant with a huge Baldwin Apple.The Chief Blue Meanie and his henchman Max notice what is going on and dispatch the Dreadful Flying Glove to stop the Beatles. However, Glove is defeated by John as he sings (Song: All You Need is Love). Meanwhile, Ringo rescues Jeremy, who gets a boost to his confidence when he accidentally knocks out his guard with a falling apple.The Beatles then come across a giant Glass Globe, which encases the real Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They were trapped at the start of the Blue Meanie attack by an Anti-Music Missile. They cannot open the globe until Ringo remembers that he has a hole in his pocket. He uses the hole to open the globe and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is released. The dopplegangers are greatly amused by their resemblance until the blue four-headed dog attacks.Our heroes confuse and defeat the dog by hiding in a player piano (Song: Hey Bulldog). <the Hey Bulldog sequence was omitted from the original theatrical release>Jeremy confronts the Chief Blue Meanie and defeats him by quoting poetry that causes the Chief to burst into bloom with pink flowers. The Blue Meanies all run away in confusion.The Beatles and Jeremy call on the Blue Meanies to change their ways and join them in the musical fun. The Chief Blue Meanie and Max have a change of heart and the Blue Meanies join and party with their new friends. (Song: Its All Too Much)The real Beatles (in a live action sequence) reprise their adventures. John then warns that there are newer and bluer meanies sighted near this theatre! So, the Beatles go out singing. (Reprise: All Together Now)."

Link Bickering siblings Johnny and Barbra are traveling by car to a rural cemetery, where they visit their father's grave. Johnny complains that the drive is too long for the simple act of placing a flowered cross on the grave. Johnny teases his sister's fear of the cemetery after dark, saying ""They're coming to get you, Barbra!"" They are approached by a tall, pale-faced man who stumbles toward them and suddenly attacks Barbra. Johnny pulls the man off of Barbra and struggles with him, but is knocked unconscious and possibly dead after the man thrusts Johnny's head violently on the edge of a gravestone. The man then pursues Barbra back to the car, but Barbra cannot start it without Johnny's keys. She takes the car out of gear and it begins to drift away on its own, but she accidentally steers it into a tree. She abandons the car and runs down a roadway to a nearby farmhouse, with the man still pursuing her. She discovers the house seemingly deserted, and the phone is out of order. Her attacker stumbles around the outside of the house looking for her, and is joined by several others. They all seem to be in a kind of trance. Exploring the house further, Barbra makes a gruesome find at the top of the stairs: a human body that seems to have been partially devoured by something.In a panic and attempting to flee the house, Barbra is intercepted by Ben, who arrives in a pickup truck and attacks the mysterious figures with a tire iron. Barbra is further driven into hysteria when she sees Ben violently smashing the skulls of the strange men who keep trying to get into the house. Ben urges her into action and the two of them begin boarding up the doors and windows from the inside with dismantled furniture and scraps of wood. They awkwardly trade their stories; Ben seems to be a drifter who was passing through the area when suddenly a wave of unexplained violence began unfolding. He tells Barbra about a scene of mayhem that he encountered at a diner, and Barbra tells him about the incident with Johnny in the cemetery. When Barbra becomes hysterical and wants to go out after Johnny, she strikes Ben and Ben hits her in the face. Barbra passes out in shock.Ben finds a rifle and a radio as Barbra lies incapacitated on a couch in the living room listening to the radio report. Emergency broadcasters tell stories of widespread violence and mayhem being committed by people who seem to be in a 'trance'. Ben continues to board up the doors and windows with anything he can find: he finds a hammer and nails and uses the interior doors, part of a dining table and an ironing board. He also makes a lucky find with a lever-action rifle and cartridges. Suddenly, Barbra is startled when the cellar door opens and two men emerge from the basement. Ben is attracted by her screams and they confront the newcomers. An older middle-aged man introduces himself as Harry Cooper, and the younger man is named Tom. Harry says that he has his wife, Helen, and his daughter, Karen, are in the basement as well. Karen has been hurt and cannot be moved. Tom has a girlfriend named Judy, also in the cellar.Immediately the group begins bickering. Ben is furious with Tom and Harry for not coming out earlier to help him barricade the house. Harry is an irrational and domineering man who insists that they all barricade themselves in the cellar and wait for help. Ben refuses, saying that if their attackers ever got into the cellar, it would be the end of all of them, as there is only one entrance -- if they stay upstairs they have a ""fighting chance"" to hold off their attackers outside. Harry angrily says he's going back to his family in the basement and will barricade the door. Ben angrily agrees, saying that he'll defend everything in the upper part of the house. Tom calls his girlfriend Judy upstairs. Harry bars the door while Tom tries to reason with him, saying they can defend the house if they all work together. Harry gloats that they'll be safer down there, but when Helen learns about the group and that they have a radio that keeps them informed, she insists that they go upstairs into the house to help out.Radio reports explain that an epidemic of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern seaboard of the United States. Later, Ben discovers a television and the whole group watches the emergency broadcaster who reveals that the murderers are recently deceased human beings who have returned to life and who are consuming their victims' flesh. Experts including scientists and military generals are not sure of the cause of the reanimation, but one scientist is certain that it is the result of radiation emanating from a Venus space probe that exploded in the Earth's atmosphere. The report instructs that a gunshot or heavy blow to the head will stop the ""ghouls"" and that posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.The TV broadcast provides a constantly scrolling list of local towns that contain ""rescue stations"" to provide citizens with protection and necessities. Ben notices a nearby town called Willard which Tom and Judy recognize since they're from the area. Ben devises a plan to escape using his truck, but it needs refueling. While Harry throws Molotov cocktails out a second floor window at the walking dead outside the house, Ben exits the house armed with the rifle and a flaming torch. Tom and Judy offer assistance, but when they arrive at a fuel pump near the house, Tom carelessly splashes gasoline on the truck and torch, starting a grass fire that quickly spreads to cover the truck. Judy's sleeve is caught on something inside the truck when it explodes with Tom and Judy inside. Ben runs back to the house to find that Harry locked him out. He kicks the door open and forces his way inside, and after Harry helps him board up the front door again, he punches Harry repeatedly for his cowardice, furiously telling him he should throw Cooper out the front door and let the zombies eat him. As Cooper watches in horror, some of the living dead eagerly begin eating Tom and Judy's charred remains.A little later, another broadcast comes on the television, showing a local news reporter (Bill Cardille) interviewing a local sheriff (George Kosana) about the search and rescue operations that are underway in the area. Another news report indicates that the levels of the ""mysterious radiation"" in the area have been increasing, suggesting that the phenomenon is going to become even more widespread than it already is, but also that the situation is going to be under control soon. The reporter asks if ordinary people can fight off the attacks and the sheriff confidently tells him shots to the head, blows to the head with blunt objects and fire are all effective against the hordes. At that moment, the house goes dark when the area loses power. Perhaps triggered by the darkness, the ghouls surrounding the house begin to attack, attempting to break through all of the boarded up the doors and windows of the house. Ben manages to hold them back, but drops his rifle. Harry seizes the fallen rifle and turns it on Ben. Cooper orders his wife to go down to the cellar. Ben manages to wrest the rifle away from Harry and then shoots him. Harry stumbles into the cellar and dies, approaching Karen's seemingly lifeless body.Helen also attempts to hold off the zombies, whose great numbers are beginning to overwhelm the barricades over the windows and doors. Barbra suddenly comes out of her catatonic state throws herself into the battle, and Helen escapes back into the cellar, where she discovers that her daughter has been transformed into one of the living dead and is consuming part of Harry's corpse. Karen stabs her mother repeatedly with a cement trowel, killing her, before going upstairs.Meanwhile, the undead finally break into the house and Barbra sees her brother Johnny among them. The resultant shock causes her to lower her defenses and she is carried away into the zombie horde. (Barbra's fate is not shown, but it is strongly assumed that she is eaten alive by the mob of flesh-eating ghouls). Then, the zombie Karen comes up from the basement and attacks Ben, but he throws her aside and retreats into the cellar, locking the door behind him (which, ironically, was Harry's plan all along). When Harry and Helen Cooper reanimate, he shoots them both. With nowhere to go, Ben crouches in a corner of the basement with his rifle ready to make his last stand, while the undead walk through the house as well as pound on the boarded up basement door. The reinforced door holds and the ghouls give up trying to force their way into the basement.In the morning, the undead mob has left the house and disbursed. A posse approaches the house and kills the remaining zombies lurking around the house. Hearing the commotion and gunshots, Ben cautiously goes up the cellar stairs into the living room and peers out the window. The sheriff from the newscast sees Ben and orders one of his men to shoot him. His body is carried from the house and burned in a large bonfire with the rest of the zombie corpses."

Bounty killers led by Loco prey on outlaws hiding out in the snowbound Utahn mountains. After Pauline's husband becomes Loco's latest victim, she hires a gunman for revenge; Silence, mute since his throat was cut when he was a boy.—Tom Seldon <elpuro@msn.com> Henry Pollicut (Luigi Pistilli), a corrupt Utah banker and justice of the peace, has a man named Gordon (Jean Louis Trintignant) and his wife murdered by two bounty killers. To prevent Gordon's son from giving them away, one of the killers slices the boy's throat, rendering him permanently mute.Years later, in the year 1898, a severe blizzard has swept the Utah frontier, bringing privation to the town of Snow Hill. As a result, much of the community is forced to steal in order to survive. Pollicut, seeking to make a profit, places prices on the thieves' heads, attracting the attention of a bounty killer gang led by ""Loco"" (Klaus Kinski). As they prey on the outlaws, Gordon's adult son, now going by the moniker ""Silence"" (also played by Jean Louis Trintignant), works with the bandits and their allies to fight against the killers. Silence operates on a principle whereby he provokes his enemies into drawing their weapons first so he can kill them in self-defense with his Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol.One of the outlaws, James Middleton, leaves the safety of the group to be with his wife, Pauline (Vonetta McGee). James is subsequently killed by Loco when he takes Pauline hostage. Vengeful, Pauline writes to Silence, requesting him to kill Loco. Meanwhile, the newly-elected Governor (Carlo D' Angelo), hoping to have order maintained before declaring an amnesty regarding the outlaws, assigns the righteous but bumbling soldier Gideon Burnett (Frank Wolff) as the sheriff of Snow Hill.On his way, Burnett encounters the outlaws, who steal his horse for food. After getting lost in the snow, he finds a stagecoach travelling to Snow Hill, on which he meets Silence, and later, Loco. Upon arrival, Silence meets Pauline, who promises to raise his reward.Pauline attempts to sell her house to Pollicut, who demands that she becomes his mistress; his reason for putting a bounty on her husband. Pauline bitterly refuses.Silence leaves for the town saloon, and attempts to provoke Loco into drawing. Instead, Loco savagely beats him before Silence fights back. Angered, Loco attempts to shoot him, but he is stopped by Burnett, who arrests him for attempted murder and prepares to take him to a prison in Tonopah. Before leaving, Burnett requests that the townspeople provide food for the outlaws. Meanwhile, Pauline becomes romantically and sexually involved with Silence while tending his wounds.Burnett and Loco stop by a frozen lake to allow Loco to relieve himself, but he springs a trap, shooting the ice surrounding Burnett and leaving him to die in the freezing water. Loco rides to his hideout and convinces the rest of his gang to confront Silence.Determined to take Pauline by force, Pollicut attempts to rape her as his henchman, Martin, tortures Silence by burning his right hand. Silence overpowers Martin and kills Pollicut.Loco and his gang arrive to look for Silence, just as the outlaws appear at the edge of town to collect the provisions, having been previously advised to do so by Burnett. Deciding to use them to draw out Silence, the gang herds the bandits into the saloon and captures Pauline. Loco tells Pauline to have Silence duel with him... if Silence wins, the outlaws will be set free; if he wins, they will be killed.Despite Pauline's pleas that the duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly impairing his speed and marksmanship. Loco then stands in the doorway, ready to face the weakened Silence. As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser, Loco reaches for his Colt Single Action Army... but as Silence draws, another wounding shot is fired. Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him. Distraught, Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself, but swiftly dies as well. The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws, massacring the entire group. As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun.A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in widespread public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed."

Desirous of starting a family, young Catholic homemaker Rosemary Woodhouse and her struggling actor husband Guy move into The Bramford: New York City's iconic building brimming with unpleasant stories of obscure dwellers and ghastly occurrences. And before long, the eccentric next-door neighbours Roman and Minnie Castevet befriend the young couple; shortly afterwards, Rosemary gets pregnant. However, as the inexperienced mother becomes systematically cut off from her circle of friends, alarming hints of a sinister, well-planned conspiracy start to emerge, enfolding timid Rosemary in a shroud of suspicion and mental agony.

Guy becomes enchanted with their eccentric neighbors, Roman and Minnie Castevet, after the elderly couple's ward seems to commit suicide. Then Rosemary becomes pregnant. A caring Minnie keeps giving her weird concoctions for the pregnancy and Rosemary does not feel at all well. As the tagline says, the only solution is to pray for Rosemary's baby.—alfiehitchie New York City, fall of 1965: Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young married couple who rent an apartment in the gothic and splendorous Bramford building in Manhattan. At first, their friend and current landlord Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins (Maurice Evans) tries to dissuade them from doing so: the building has a rather unsavory past. It has been occupied by cannibal killers, Satanists and witches, such as the Trench Sisters, Keith Kennedy, Pearl Ames--and the sinister Adrian Marcato, who created a scandal in the late 1890s by claiming to have conjured ""The Living Devil.""Rosemary and Guy decide to move in anyway. Guy is an actor with a fledgling career. He's done plenty of TV plays and commercials, which have made him good money; but he wants great parts. Rosemary is a gentle soul, originally from Omaha, Nebraska, where she had been raised in a Catholic home and had attended convent school.As it is, Rosemary is estranged from her family, since they don't accept her marriage to Guy, who is not only an actor, but is also of mixed Jewish/Protestant upbringing. So her life in New York is all she has: she is a young housewife dedicated entirely to making a good home for her husband, whom she adores. She has a good circle of friends, but is at core sweetly naïve and lonely.One day in the laundry room, Rosemary makes the acquaintance of Terry Gionnoffrio (Victoria Vetri), a young former drug addict who was ""rescued from the gutter"" by an elderly, eccentric couple, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). The Castavets's apartment had formerly been the front part of theirs, but is now separated by a partition.Her friendship with Terry is short-lived. A few days after Rosemary meets her, Terry plunges to her death from the bay window. She and Guy are walking home when they see the police surrounding Terry's corpse. The Castevets happen to be walking home, too. Presumably distraught, they strike up an acquaintance with the Woodhouses and later invite them to dinner. Rosemary becomes suspicious about their new elderly friends, particularly the way that Roman insists on speaking with Guy in private. Other things trouble her, too, such as when Guy's career gets a jump start when his main rival, Donald Baumgart, suddenly goes blind. Now all he cares about is his new play.But then suddenly, he decides he wants to become a father. Rosemary is thrilled. Evidently having studied her ovulation cycle himself, he announces the ideal ""baby night."" That evening, Minnie drops by to give them some chocolate mousse -- or ""mouse"" as she calls it. Rosemary complains of a chalky undertaste, but Guy gets angry over her ingratitude. She eats part of it, and then furtively hides the rest in her napkin.Suddenly feeling disoriented after dinner, she passes out and has a bizarre dream. Rosemary is floating on a mattress in the sea, visits a cruise ship with the Kennedys, has her wedding band removed, is carried through the Sistine Chapel, a brief shot of the linen closet with guy saying ""easy, you got her too high"" then she's back on the cruise ship naked and told by the skipper go below the deck and passes by a burning church and lays down on a mattress. The unsettling dream becomes a nightmare when she finds herself surrounded by naked elderly people, a statue figure of a bearded man staring down at her, and two men tie her to a bed. Then Jackie Kennedy soothes her for not feeling well. Guy approaches her bed, but then something that looks and feels inhuman brutally rapes her. ""This is no dream!"" she cries. ""This is really happening!"" Pope Paul VI, then visiting NYC and having mass at Yankee Stadium, comes to offer her absolution.When she wakes up, Rosemary is sore and scratched. Guy half-heartedly apologizes for having had her while she was out. Rosemary is angry, but ""baby night"" later proves successful. Dr. C.C. Hill (Charles Grodin) -- referred to her by her girlfriend Elise Dunstan (Emmaline Henry) --
confirms it.Upon hearing the news, the Castevets persuade Rosemary to go to Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), a prominent obstetrician who delivers all the babies of the upper class in the city. Rosemary entrusts herself to him, accepting his odd advice and his recommendation of Minnie's strange ""vitamin drinks"" which include a rare herb, tannis root. She develops pain during her first trimester, which causes her to lose weight and look emaciated, alarming Hutch -- but not the doctor, Guy, the Castevets or their Saturday night gang of quaint old timers, including Dr. Stan Shand (Phil Leeds) and the obnoxious Laura-Louise McBurney (Patsy Kelly).As her pregnancy progresses, Rosemary feels a mounting sense of dread and angst, especially since no one close to her seems to want to acknowledge her pain. She decides to throw a party for her young friends, a qualification she insists upon. She also insists that they not invite the Castevets. Her girlfriends -- including Elise, Joan Jellico (Marianne Gordon) and Tiger Hoanigsen (Wende Wagner) -- tell her she looks awful and that her pain is far from normal. She has to see a new doctor. Rosemary tells Guy, and they fight bitterly over it, but at the last minute she relents. The pain has suddenly stopped. And she can now feel the baby kicking.Rosemary's friend Hutch drops by for a visit; Roman and Minnie spot him, and suddenly Guy arrives home unexpectedly, as if they'd phoned him and urged him to rush back to the apartment. Hutch asks a lot of questions of Roman and Guy, and before he leaves the apartment, he realizes he's misplaced one of his gloves. Later, Hutch falls into a mysterious coma and dies. Rosemary receives a book from Hutch's companion, Grace Cardiff (Hanna Landy), which Hutch had intended to give to Rosemary personally. It's called ""All of Them Witches,"" a study on witchcraft through the ages, featuring a chapter on Adrian Marcato (his appearance is familiar from the ""dream"") and his son, Steven. ""The name is an anagram,"" is the final clue Hutch had left for her. Rosemary uses her Scrabble tiles to learn the horrible truth: ""Roman Castevet"" is an anagram for ""Steven Marcato.""Now she suspects Roman, Minnie and all their all-too-helpful friends are Satan worshipers. She visits Dr. Sapirstein and tells him she'll have no more to do with them. It's just as well, Sapirstein informs her: Roman is dying and would like to go away to Europe on a farewell tour. Rosie feels guilty about her suspicions, and when the time comes, bids them a fond farewell.But not all is what it seems. As her due date -- June 28, 1966 -- nears, she learns one strange thing after the other. Could it be that Guy is involved with witches? Witches use babies for their rituals. Has he promised them the baby? She also learns that witches use the belongings of their intended victims to blind or kill them. On a hunch, she contacts Guy's former rival, Donald Baumgart, and gets him to reveal that Guy swapped neckties with him just before he went blind.Distraught, Rosemary packs a suitcase and goes to Dr. Sapirstein to tell him what she's learned. But his secretary's off-hand remark reveals something horrible -- the good doctor sometimes smells like tannis root, which she has learned is more commonly called Devil's Pepper. Dr. Sapirstein is a witch, too and must be part of the plot against her. Rosemary calls Dr. Hill from a payphone on the street and persuades him to see her. When she reveals her suspicions to him, he seems to take her seriously, and he gives her a sedative to help her sleep, but she is horrified when she awakens and find that Guy and Dr. Sapirstein have arrived to take her back home and Hill is unwilling to stop them, seemingly frightened of them. She manages lock them out of the apartment, but before she can call for help, Guy and the others appear in the apartment, having entered by some other means. Rosemary tries to fight them off and she goes into labor. They have to force her down on her bed, while Sapirstein injects her with a sedative.When she wakes, Guy tells her she has had a boy and that he's fine. Later, Sapirstein tells her that the baby is dead. The coven members sit with Rosemary, collecting her breast milk, and she thinks she can hear a baby crying through the walls of the apartment. She knows they have taken the baby, and she thinks they are planning to sacrifice it for one of their rituals.After a few days of pretending to cooperate and take her sedatives, Rosemary arms herself with a sharp butcher knife and finds the partition between her apartment and the apartment of the Castevets. Removing the closet interior, she finds the hidden doorway to the other apartment and steals inside. She looks at an oil painting of a burning church whispering ""you got her too high"", apparently having a flashback of the ""dream"". She discovers the entire coven sitting in the living room around a bassinet, including Minnie and Roman. A photo of Adrian Marcato is up above the mantle. There are other people there, too, that Rosemary does not recognize, people that seem to have come from as far away as Japan. She approaches the bassinet, which is adorned with an inverted cross, and sees the baby for the first time (not shown to the audience), horrified that the baby has strange eyes. ""He has his father's eyes,"" Roman tells her, and the coven tells her that Satan is the baby's father, not Guy. Guy finally tells her that he made an agreement with the coven to allow them to impregnate Rosemary with the spawn of the Devil in exchange for a successful acting career. Rosemary spits in his face and sinks into a chair, defeated. Minnie brings her a cup of tea. Roman speaks more gently to her and encourages her to be the baby's mother and does not need to join their evil coven. Although Rosemary hesitates at first, her maternal instincts win and she approaches the bassinet, telling the witch rocking it that she's rocking the baby too fast. The witch protests at first until Roman orders her to leave the crib. Rosemary begins to rock the baby and sings to it."

After peaceful floating in zero-gravity, astronaut Barbarella lands on the frozen planet Lythion and sets out to find renowned scientist Durand Durand in the City of Night, Sogo, where a new sin is invented every hour. She encounters such objects as the Excessive Machine, a genuine sex organ on which an expert artist of the keyboard--in this case, Durand Durand himself--can drive a victim to death by pleasure, a lesbian queen who can make her fantasies take form in her Chamber of Dreams, and a group of ladies smoking a giant hookah which dispenses Essence of Man through a poor victim struggling in its glass globe.

Durand Durand has invented the Positronic Ray, a powerful weapon that Earth leaders fear will fall into the wrong hands.

Barbarella rewards him with sex and Mark informs her that Durand Durand should be in the City of Night, Sogo. Barbarella begins a dangerous mission to save Earth from the evil Durand Durand, who prepares to crown himself lord of Sogo. On her perilous (and quite sexy) trek, she teams with blind angel Pygar and battles the Black Queen along with various sexual-torture devices.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the future, a beautiful astronomatrix named Barbarella (Jane Fonda) floats through the galaxy in her spaceship, the Alpha-7. Suddenly, she receives an urgent call on her monitor from none other than the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin). He informs her that a young scientist named Durand Durand went missing sometime during a mission to the North Star and is believed to have landed somewhere in the Tau Ceti star system. Not much is known about this region of space--the President worries that Durand's invention, the positronic ray, may fall into the hands of a primitive culture; beings who might seek to use this technology as a weapon and launch an intergalactic war. Since the Earth, free of all conflict for centuries, lacks military and police personnel, the President tasks Barbarella with a mission to find the scientist. He teleports her some weapons and a device that will signal the presence of Durand Durand. The latter has a tonguebox incorporated in its design which can translate any language.Barbarella spends most of the journey to Tau Ceti in suspended animation. She awakens just in time to lose control of her spacecraft and crash land on Planet 16, which her spaceship informs her contains an atmosphere similar to Earth's. She changes into a new outfit to explore the arctic terrain. The first humanoids she meets are a pair of twin girls--they jabber to her excitedly in a language she can't understand. Before she can adjust her tonguebox, one of them knocks Barbarella unconscious with a piece of ice. The girls then pull the dazed explorer along in their sled, which is attached to a manta ray-like creature that glides across the ice.The girls arrive with Barbarella at the wreck of another craft where several other sets of twin children are sheltered and indigo-blue bunny rabbits abound. Barbarella recognizes the wreck as the Alpha-1, former spaceship of Durand Durand. The children tie Barbarella to a post and bring out several mechanical dolls that walk towards her. It soon becomes apparent that the dolls all have sharp metal teeth and hinged jaws. They bite Barbarella while the children giggle gleefully, amused by their game.Suddenly, a man appears with several armored guards. He cracks a whip and captures the children in a net, then unties Barbarella. Once she gets her tonguebox working, she's able to understand him when he explains that he is a Catchman named Mark Hand (Ugo Tognazzi) and that all children are sent away to the forests of Weir ""until they've reached a serviceable age"", at which point he captures them and brings them back to civilization. He offers Barbarella a ride back to her spaceship. When she asks how she can repay him, he tells her that he would like to make love to her. Back on Earth, when people want to bond, erotically, they each take an exultation transference pill and press their palms against one another's. Barbarella is prepared to do this with the Catchman, but he's not interested in all that, he tells Barbarella that he wants to have sex on the bed in his snowship. She reluctantly agrees to do this the old-fashioned way, but soon discovers that she finds the experience quite enjoyable. The Catchman gives her a fur and repairs her spaceship, only when she tries to fly off, the ship's computer informs her that it's been repaired in reverse. She crashes back into the planet and quickly activates the ship's terra-screws so that she can tunnel through the planet's core.She surfaces in the Labyrinth, amongst strange creatures including an ""ornithanthrope"", or angel, named Pygar (John Phillip Law), who was blinded in the city of Sogo. Pygar takes Barbarella to visit Professor Ping (Marcel Marceau) who explains that Pygar is aerodynamically sound, but lacks the morale to fly. Pygar, Professor Ping and all of the other unfortunates who roam the Labyrinth were imprisoned there by order of the Great Tyrant. They are not evil enough to be allowed to live in Sogo, the City of Night. Pygar takes Barbarella to his nest where they have sex. This restores Pygar's will to fly and Barbarella convinces him to fly them both to Sogo. Meanwhile, Professor Ping agrees to try and repair Barbarella's spacecraft.As they fly over the Labyrinth, Barbarella and Pygar are attacked by several of the Great Tyrant's black guards, but they destroy them all. They enter the city where Pygar's wings attract immediate attention. He is abducted and Barbarella is cornered by a pair of ruffians who seem to have rape on their minds, but before they can lay a hand on Barbarella, they're both stabbed in the back by a woman with an eyepatch. The woman wants to play with Barbarella, but Barbarella rejects her advances and runs off to find Pygar.She sees the angel up on another level of the city, drawing jeers from a mob. Shielding him from the mob, she tells Pygar to back up since there's a room behind them. The mob doesn't follow, and Barbarella belatedly learns that it's because they've retreated into in the Chamber of Ultimate Solutions, which metes out various ""exciting and surprising"" forms of death. Before they're forced to choose one of the solutions, the Concierge of the Great Tyrant (Milo O'Shea) enters and escorts them both out of the room. He explains that the silvery slime moving under the floor is the Mathmos, the lifeforce that sustains all of the evil in Sogo. Pygar is immediately swooped up in a net, while the Concierge pushes Barbarella down a chute. She emerges in the court of the Great Tyrant. The twin girls from Weir, Stomoxis and Glossina (Catherine ChevallierandMarie Therese Chevallier), clamor to play with Barbarella, but the Concierge scolds them to allow their aunt, the Great Tyrant, have her turn first. Barbarella is soon granted audience with the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg), whom she recognizes as the ""one-eyed wench"" who rescued her earlier. The Great Tyrant drawls that she often likes to walk disguised among her people. She reveals that she's crucified Pygar and is holding him hostage so that Barbarella will play with her. Barbarella pretends to acquiesce but reaches under Pygar's loincloth and grabs a gun she had stashed there. She threatens to shoot the Great Tyrant in the face unless Pygar is released. The Great Tyrant complies, but her Concierge calls Barbarella's bluff when he notices that her power buckle is depleted. He suggests giving Barbarella ""to the birds"".The Great Tyrant absconds with Pygar and attempts to ravish him, but he doesn't understand her demands for sex, stating that ""An angel does not make love; an angel is love."" She sends him away to be devoured by the Mathmos.Meanwhile, the Concierge locks Barbarella in a glass cage. It's empty at first but soon fills with hundreds of finches and parakeets that peck her mercilessly. In the middle of this ordeal, a trap door opens up and she slides down a chute into the secret headquarters of the Resistance, led by one Dildano (David Hemmings). Dildano informs Barbarella of his plans to overthrow the Great Tyrant by ambushing her while she sleeps in her Chamber of Dreams. He even possesses a key to this chamber which is invisible. He asks Barbarella to help their cause, and she agrees to do what she can once Professor Ping has fixed her spaceship. She offers to have sex with Dildano, but he disdains sex, preferring to use the pill like a civilized Earthling. Barbarella reluctantly agrees even though they haven't exchanged psychocardiograms. After a session of hand-to-hand intercourse, Barbarella leaves the headquarters via another chute that deposits her somewhere else in the city. The Concierge finds her and takes her to his torture device, an organ-like machine that will cause Barbarella to die of pleasure. Barbarella's capacity for pleasure is so great that she breaks the machine, enraging the Concierge. Just as the Concierge is deciding what to do with Barbarella next, her homing device begins to bleep, indicating that she is in the presence of Durand Durand. Barbarella can't believe that the Concierge is the man she has been seeking; she was told that Durand Durand was in his mid-20s and the Concierge looks to be in his 50s. He attributes this to the lifestyle of pure evil he has been enjoying in Sogo.When he learns that Barbarella has the key to the Great Tyrant's Chamber of Dreams, he confiscates her copy of the key, throws her inside the Chamber while the Tyrant sleeps, steals the Tyrant's key and seals them both inside. He plans to take over Sogo and enacts a coronation ceremony, but before he can be crowned, the city falls under attack by the Resistance. Durand Durand uses the positronic ray to send the resistance fighters to the Fourth Dimension. However, the Great Tyrant unleashes the Mathmos, which consumes everyone else, including Durand Durand. Only Barbarella and Pygar prove immune to the Mathmos, which cannot digest their goodness. Pygar takes Barbarella in one arm and the Great Tyrant in the other and begins to fly to safety. When Barbarella asks why he's saving the woman who tried to kill him and has destroyed the entire planet, he serenely replies that ""An angel has no memory."""

Where Eagles Dare,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065207/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Allied agents stage a daring raid on a castle where the Nazis are holding American brigadier general George Carnaby prisoner, but that's not all that's really going on. During World War II, a British aircraft is shot down and crashes in Nazi held territory. The Germans capture the only survivor, American Brigadier General George Carnaby (Robert Beatty), and take him to the nearest S.S. headquarters. Unknown to the Germans, the General has full knowledge of the D-Day operation. The British decide that the General must not be allowed to divulge any details of the Normandy landing at all costs, and order Major Jonathan Smith (Richard Burton) to lead a crack commando team to rescue him. Amongst the team is an American Ranger, Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), who is puzzled by his inclusion in an all British operation. When one of the team dies after the parachute drop, Schaffer suspects that Smith's mission has a much more secret objective.—Dave Jenkins <david.jenkins@smallworld.co.uk> Several months before D-Day, the British stage a daring rescue deep inside Germany. Led by British Major Jonathan Smith (Richard Burton) and including one American, Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), their mission is to rescue American Brigadier General George Carnaby (Robert Beatty), whose airplane was shot down over Germany. Carnaby, one of the architects of the D-Day invasion, is being held in the Schloss Adler, the Eagle's Castle, built high on a promontory and accessible only by cable car. The team successfully parachutes into Germany, but loses its radioman in the jump, and then a second member of the team within a day. Taken prisoner by the Germans, Smith's true mission is revealed.—garykmcd In 1944, American Brigadier General George Carnaby (Robert Beatty) is shot down over a heavily defended German fortress and imprisoned within. A rescue attempt is at once is launched by British Intellegence, since the General must be liberated before being made to reveal Allied plans for an invasion of France. As the mission unfolds, however, double and triple Agents begin to appear in the ranks of the rescue team, with the added mystery of American Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood) assigned to the mission for reasons unknown.—Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> It is the winter of 1944. A lone transport plane, in German Luftwaffe insignia, picks its way through the peaks of the Bavarian Alps by night. Inside, seven paratroopers, in German Fallschirmjaeger uniform, wait in grim silence for the jump signal. Among them is their leader, Major Smith (Richard Burton) and his junior officer, Lieutenant Schaeffer (Clint Eastwood). The others: Christiansen (Donald Houston), Barkely (Peter Barkworth), Thomas (William Squire), Mac Pherson (Neil Mc Carthy) and Harrod (Brook Williams) are enlisted men. In the silent tension, Major Smith ponders his mission briefing.Flashing back to headquarters in London, the Fallschirjaeger paratroops turn out to be a team of highly trained British MI6 agents (except for Shaeffer, who is on loan from the American OSS). Briefed by intelligence chief, Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern), and his executive officer, Colonel Turner (Patrick Wymark), the team's mission is to rescue a captured American, General Carnaby (Robert Beatty), an Allied planner for Operation Overlord (D-Day). The General's plane has been shot down, and he is being held prisoner at the Schloss Adler (Castle of Eagles), an impregnable mountain-top fortress that also serves as headquarters for the German Alpine Korps. The prisoner must be rescued before he can divulge any information about Operation Overlord.Back in the present, the plane reaches its drop zone and the seven commandos parachute into a snow-covered mountain wilderness. Unseen by any of the men, a mysterious woman, also in Fallschirmjaeger gear, emerges from the planes cargo compartment and jumps after them. Smith's team gathers on their landing zone, only to find that their radioman, Harrod, is missing. After a quick search, he is found dead, his neck apparently broken in the drop. However, Major Smith is suspicious. Though the radioman's neck is bruised, there are no logs or large rocks buried beneath the snow to account for such an injury. He keeps silent, however, about his misgivings, and the group carries on to shelter in a high Alpine farmhouse that remains unoccupied in winter.Once there, Smith claims he's forgotten the code books carried by the dead radioman and goes back out into the night to get them, but instead detours around to the barn where he meets the mystery woman from the plane, Mary (Mary Ure). They obviously know each other very well, and after an hour of her company, Smith returns to the farmhouse. A skeptical Lt. Schaffer sits there patiently waiting, cleaning his gun, He obviously doesn't believe a word of Smith's story, but says nothing.The next day, the team climbs over the next ridge in the mountains, and see the Schloss-Adler castle on a peak across the valley. Waiting until dusk, they descend and sneak into the village at the base of the mountain. Changing into Wermacht uniforms, they bluff their way into the village and enter an inn, listening for information on Gen. Carnaby. Smith has a coded exchange with the barmaid (who turns out to be a British agent as well), and shortly thereafter meets both her and Mary in the woodshed behind the inn. He explains that he's in a hurry to get into the castle above because the Germans don't really have an American General, but instead have an impersonator named Cartright Jones who knows nothing about the second front. Astonished, Mary can't believe they've gone to all this trouble to rescue an imposter, but Smith has no time for further explanations, and produces forged papers that will get Mary into the castle that night with a new job as a servant.Exiting the woodshed, Smith finds another member of his team murdered, laying in the snow behind a scout car. He rejoins Schaffer in the inn, who has had enough of Smith's deceptions, and demands to be told the real story behind this mission, or he's out. As Smith starts to explain, the SS bursts in, capturing Smith, Schaffer and the other three agents. Smith and Schaffer are driven away in a staff car, while the other three men are taken away for questioning. Mary meanwhile rides the cable car up to the castle and begins to make her preparations.A mile from the village, Schaffer and Smith manage to start a fight in the car and to kill the German soldiers. They hike back to the village, pick up their hidden gear, blow up a warehouse as a diversion, steal a motorcycle and drive back out of the village along the road to the airport. They install small bombs on the telephone poles along the road, and rig trip wires to snow-poles along the road edge. Returning once more to the village, they find their three fellow agents being led into the cable car for a trip up to the castle, and make their way quickly up onto the roof of the terminal. As the car pulls out, Smith and Schaffer climb onto its roof, riding unseen up to the castle.After a harrowing ride on top of the cable car, they leap to the ledge above the terminal and claw their way up. Far above, Mary lowers a rope from a castle window, and they climb up the cliff face. Laying their final plans, Smith and Schaffer quietly make their way to the castle's great hall, where the Germans are talking to ""Carnaby"" over brandy and cigars. Since he politely but firmly refuses to tell them anything, they must regrettably resort to Scopolamine to get the information they want. The three captured members of Smith's rescue team are also brought in, and it is revealed that they are really double agents, posing as British but working for the Germans. As they are about to inject the fake General with truth serum, Smith quietly walks up out of the shadows surprising everyone, and declares that the double agents are still lying. Smith himself is tracking them, and he is really working for SS Military Intelligence. Pointing his gun at an astonished Schaffer, Smith tells him to sit down and shut up.Smith goes on to prove his true loyalties to the German High Command, and manages to convince the three traitors that they have been trapped. Desperate to prove they are really on the same side, they write down all the info they have on Nazi agents working in England. Smith gathers this up and asks German Col. Kramer (Anton Diffring) to review it, then quietly signals Schaffer to get ready. ""Compare their notes with my original,"" he tells Kramer, handing him another notebook. Leafing through it, Kramer finds all the pages are blank, and is stunned by the realization that Smith had duped them all. He really is a British agent, and has tricked the Nazis into revealing their entire spy network in England.In the ensuing confusion, Smith and Schaffer (who tells Smith that he's ""about as confused as I ever hope to be"") battle their way back out of the castle and onto the cable car. Escaping back down to the village, they highjack a large bus and speed out of town with the Germans in hot pursuit. Tripping the bombs they'd laid ealier as they drive by, the telephone poles are blasted in half and fall to block the road. The Germans are slowed but not stopped, and use dynamite of their own to blast through the obstacles. The team manages to beat them to the airport, where the same plane that had flown them in now swoops down and lands, allowing them to clamber in and escape through a hail of gunfire.Taking a long sigh of relief, they sit back as they're met in the plane by the man who'd sent them on this mission, Col. Turner (Patrick Wymark), second in command of British Intelligence. As he reviews the list of agents in disbelief, as Smith calmly tells Turner that there's one name that isn't on the list: that of the top German agent in England, confirmed by Colonel Kramer back at the castle. He shows the note to Turner, who shoots an alarmed look back at Smith.""It's your own name Colonel,"" he says. ""Don't look so surprised.""Pointing a gun at Smith, Turner calmly tries to talk his way out, but cannot. When in desperation he pulls the trigger to shoot Smith, the gun doesn't fire; Smith had removed to firing pin before the mission. With no cards left to play and facing certain hanging, Turner, sweat beading on his forehead, calmly asks if there is an alternative.""Do you want it?"" asks Smith.Turner nods. He slowly gets up, walks to the door in the rear of the plane and opens it. Taking a last bitter look at Smith, he jumps to his death.""Is that it Major?"" asks Schaffer tiredly as he replaces the door.""Yes, that's it,"" replies Smith. He leans back in his seat and closes his eyes. The plane lumbers on through the night, returning to England."

The Thomas Crown Affair,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063688/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A debonair, adventuresome bank executive believes he has pulled off the perfect multi-million dollar heist, only to match wits with a sexy insurance investigator who will do anything to get her man. Four men pull off a daring daytime robbery at a bank, dump the money in a trash can and go their separate ways. Thomas Crown, a successful, wealthy businessman pulls up in his Rolls and collects it. Vickie Anderson, an independent insurance investigator is called in to recover the huge haul. She begins to examine the people who knew enough about the bank to have pulled the robbery and discovers Crown. She begins a tight watch on his every move and begins seeing him socially. How does the planner of the perfect crime react to pressure?—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> An unknown man hires four unrelated men to carry off a bank heist of over $2 million. The four meet for the first time during the actual heist itself, which is carried off successfully. Their unknown leader is suave and wealthy Sir Thomas Crown, an executive at the bank that was hit. Eddy Malone, the Boston police detective in charge of the case, is coming up empty in his investigation, that is until beautiful insurance investigator Vicki Anderson comes on the scene. Anderson, admittedly self-serving in that she works on commission, thinks like a thief and works on her instincts. Looking through the evidence, she believes that Crown is her man. Upon meeting, Anderson knows that Crown is the thief. Crown knows what Anderson believes as she tells him as much. Despite their positions, they are immediately attracted to each other and begin a relationship. But this does not stop their cat and mouse chase. However, the role of the cat and the role of the mouse are not always clear cut.—Huggo Millionaire businessman-sportsman Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) accomplishes a perfect crime by orchestrating four men to steal $2,660,527.62 from a Boston bank ($22,389,167 in 2022 dollars), along with a fifth man Erwin who drives the getaway car with the money and dumps it in a cemetery trash can. None of the men ever meet Crown face to face, nor do they know or meet each other before the robbery.
For planning, men were summoned to a hotel room, where they faced a set of bright lights, and a man speaking into a microphone. They are promised a payment on $50,000 in monthly installments, so they don't spend it all quickly. Thomas asks Erwin to buy a used car, with cash money provided by Thomas.The 4 men are Carl (Yaphet Kotto), Dave (Sam Melville), Benjy (Todd Martin) and Abe (Adison Powell).
Thomas coordinates the actions of the 4 men via public telephones. Abe and Carl get into a bank and take control of an elevator. Dave takes control of the security room.
They take possession of a money trolley, when it is being moved by the elevator to the vault. Once the money is in their possession, they move it to Erwin's car waiting outside.
Erwin dumps the money in a garage can in a cemetery and then changes his number plates.Crown retrieves the money from the trash can after secretly following the driver of the getaway car. He deposits the money into an anonymous Swiss bank account in Geneva, making several trips, never depositing the money all at once so as not to draw undue attention to his actions.The police are not able to find anything. All suspects were wearing sunglasses and hats. They cannot find the getaway car.Independent insurance investigator Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway) is contracted to investigate the heist; she will receive 10% of the stolen money if she recovers it. Vicki believes that the money has been moved to numbered accounts in Switzerland. The money would have to be moved by plane, and in multiple trips. She asks the Boston police to make a list of people who made multiple trips to Switzerland recently.
Vicki believes that the robbery was masterminded by an unknown entity, who orchestrated the robbers, who probably never even met each other before the day of the heist.
Vicki runs an advertisement in the papers for news on the heist, against a reward of $25,000.When Thomas first comes to her attention as a possible suspect, she intuitively recognizes him as the mastermind behind the robbery, and shortly thereafter guesses that he organized the robbers so none of the men knew him or met each other.Thomas does not need the money, and in fact masterminded the robbery as a game. Vicki makes it clear to him that she knows that he is the thief and that she intends to prove it. They start a game of cat and mouse, with the attraction between them evident. Vicki declares to Thomas that she is after him. Thomas already has $4 Million as net worth, and there is no motive for him to steal any more.
Their relationship soon evolves into an affair, complicated by Vicki's vow to find the money and help detective Eddy Malone (Paul Burke) bring the guilty party to justice.The reward offer entices the wife of the bank robbery's getaway driver, Erwin Weaver (Jack Weston) to ""fink"" on him for $25,000 ($210,383 in 2022 dollars). There are 2 witnesses who saw Erwin drive away from the bank and Erwin paid for the Ford station wagon in cash.
Erwin gets monthly payments into his bank account, from a numbered account in Geneva.
Vicki finds out that he was hired by a man he never saw, but whose voice he heard (via a microphone). She tries putting Erwin in the same room as Thomas, but there is no hint of recognition on either one's part.
Thomas knows that by now his home has been bugged by the police. He invites Vicki for a game of chess. They end up having sex.
Vicki asks Eddy to keep the pressure on Thomas. Vicki believes that Thomas is bound to make a mistake. While Vicki continues to spend personal time with Thomas. News of their romance reaches Eddy. Eddy cannot make up his mind about what Vicki is up to.
Eddy tells Vicki that Thomas has been cheating on her. He says that after leaving Vicki, Thomas goes to meet another girl.However, while Vicki is clearly closing in on Thomas, using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as leverage against his liquid assets, he forces her to realize that she is also becoming hemmed-in by her emotions. When she (seemingly) persuades him to negotiate an end, his point is proven when Eddy stubbornly refuses to make any deal.Thomas organizes another robbery exactly like the first with different accomplices and tells Vicki where the ""drop"" will be, because he has to know for sure that she is on his side. The robbery is successful, but there are gunshots, and the viewer is left with the impression that people might have been killed, raising the stakes for Vicki's decision.Vicki and the police stake out the cemetery, where they watch one of the robbers make the drop and they wait for Thomas to arrive so they can arrest him. However, when his Rolls-Royce arrives, she sees that Thomas has sent a messenger in his place, with a telegram asking her to bring the money and join him - or if not, ""you keep the car"". She tears the telegram to bits and throws the pieces to the wind, looking up at the sky with tears in her eyes. Crown flies away in a jet."

The Monsignor decides to exorcise the castle and prove to the villagers that the evil is gone. He and the priest climb the hill to the castle, but the priest chickens out halfway. The Monsignor continues alone to the castle door where he performs his exorcism and seals the castle door with a large cross. The priest, in the meantime, is taking swigs from his hipflask. He stumbles over a cliff, cuts his head, lands on the river ice, causing it to crack open just above Dracula's body.

The Party,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063415/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A clerical mistake results in a bumbling Indian film star being invited to an exclusive Hollywood party instead of being fired. Blocked from Hollywood after unwittingly levelling the set of General Fred Clutterbuck's latest war epic, bumbling Indian actor Hrundi V. Bakshi can now kiss his brief career in the movie industry goodbye. Having burned his bridges, Bakshi instead mistakenly receives an invitation to Clutterbuck's exclusive dinner soiree at his magnificent, hi-tech mansion. As the welcome intruder merrily rubs shoulders with the unaware host's hand-picked guests, Bakshi has his first-ever sip of alcohol and soon picks up where he left off. Now, only God knows how this well-thought-out gathering will end. But one thing is for certain: this will be a night to remember.—Nick Riganas Brought to Hollywood from his native India to add authenticity to a period piece filming for General Federal Studios, actor Hrundi V. Bakshi is the singular cause for one delay after another culminating with one explosive incident which ruins the picture. As such, his Hollywood career is over before it even begins. Even with the movie's Producer C.S. Divot getting word to studio chief General Fred Clutterbuck of him ruining the picture, Hrundi is inadvertently placed on the invitation list for the General and his wife Alice Clutterbuck's black tie dinner party. With neither of the hosts knowing who he is but they just assuming he is a true invited guest, Hrundi circulates among the party's other guests wreaking havoc at every turn, in part aided unwittingly by others in attendance, including the increasingly inebriated bar waiter, and aspiring actress Michele Monet, Divot's date who is unaware that this unofficial audition for Clutterbuck is planned to include a casting couch audition with Divot himself. If Hrundi is true to form, he may end up doing to the Clutterbuck house before night's end what he did to the movie set, namely inadvertently blow it up.—Huggo After getting fired from General Federal Studios, Junior Artiste, Hrundi V. Bakshi, ends up getting invited to an upscale party thrown by the wealthy Clutterbuck family. After his tryst with his shoe, he is aided by an inebriated butler and a baby elephant to create hilarious chaos for the hosts and their chic guests.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Unknown Indian actor Hrundi V. Bakshi (Peter Sellers) has been hired to play a bugler on the set of a costume epic in the style ofGunga Din (1939). He keeps on playing his bugle even though he has been shot several times, and even after the film director (Herbert Ellis) has yelled ""Cut!"". Later, as he staggers around the set, he accidentally falls on a plunger and blows up an enormous fort set. The director immediately fires Bakshi and calls the head of the studio, Fred Clutterbuck (J. Edward McKinley) to tell him about the mishap. Fred writes Bakshi's name on a piece of paper thinking he is putting him on a blacklist, but he inadvertently writes it on a list of guests to invite to an upcoming dinner party that his wife Alice (Fay McKenzie) is holding.Bakshi receives the invitation and drives in his car, a Morgan three-wheeler, to the Clutterbucks' home. When he arrives there, he tries to rinse some mud off his shoe in a large pool that flows through the house, but in doing so he loses his shoe. He makes many attempts to retrieve the shoe, but they all fail.Bakshi has several awkward interactions with everyone else at the party, even Cookie, the Clutterbucks' dog. He meets ""Wyoming Bill"" Kelso (Denny Miller), a famous Western movie actor, and receives an autograph from him. Later, Kelso is shot with a toy gun, but he doesn't see that the gun was fired by Bakshi. Bakshi feeds a caged macaw some bird food from a container marked ""Birdie Num Num"", but drops the food on the floor. He also finds an electronic control panel and at various times in the film presses the buttons for the intercom, a replica of the Manneken Pis fountain (which causes a guest to get soaked) and a retractable bar (which retracts while Fred is sitting at it).When Kelso shakes Bakshi's hand, he hurts it, and Bakshi sticks it into a nearby bowl of crushed ice unaware that it contains caviar. As he waits to wash his hand in the bathroom, he meets aspiring actress Michèle Monet (Claudine Longet) and producer C.S. Divot (Gavin MacLeod), who came to the party together. Divot shakes Bakshi's hand not knowing that it has been dipped in caviar, and as Divot goes around and interacts with other guests, he shakes their hands too and passes the fishy smell around to them, even back to Bakshi after he has washed his hands.At dinner time, Bakshi's place setting next to the kitchen door has a very low chair that puts his chin close to the table. A waiter named Levinson (Steve Franken) tries to serve dinner despite becoming increasingly drunk. Bakshi finally gets his shoe back when it is served with the hors d'oeuvres. During the main course, Bakshi's roast Cornish game hen catapults off his fork accidentally and lands on another guest's tiara. Bakshi asks Levinson to retrieve his meal, but when he tries to take it, the woman's tiara and wig both come off with it. The woman continues to engage in her conversation oblivious to her situation. The dinner is disrupted after Levinson gets into a fight with the other kitchen staff.Bakshi apologizes to his hosts, then says that he needs to go to the bathroom. He wanders through the house in search of the bathroom, and opens several doors that see him barge in on various guests and servants in embarrassing situations. His search takes him into the backyard, where he accidentally sets off the irrigation sprinkler system. Divot insists that Monet give an impromptu performance of ""Nothing to Lose"" on guitar in order to impress the guests. Continuing his search, Bakshi goes upstairs and finds Monet and Divot in a room together. He dislodges Divot's toupee and saves Monet from Divot's unwanted sexual advances. Finally, he finds a bathroom, but he breaks the toilet, drops a painting in it, gets toilet paper everywhere and floods the bathroom when some of the paper blocks the bowl after the toilet flushes. Bakshi sneaks out through the bathroom window onto the roof in order to avoid being discovered, but he loses his balance, slides down the roof and falls into the pool. Because Bakshi cannot swim, Monet has to leap into the pool to save him. Several guests race to the side of the pool to pull Bakshi and Monet out, and they coerce Bakshi to drink some alcohol to warm up, unaware that he is not accustomed to it. Under the influence, he struggles to put on a red terry towelling jumpsuit.Bakshi goes to a room where he finds Monet crying, and consoles her. Divot bursts into the room and demands that Monet leave the party with him that instant. When Monet refuses, Divot cancels her screen test for him the next day. Bakshi convinces her to stay at the party and have a good time with him. They both return to the party in borrowed clothes as a Russian dance troupe arrive.When the party gets wilder, Bakshi offers to retract the bar to make some more space for the guests to dance, but at the control panel, he presses a button that makes part of the floor where the dance troupe are performing open up, causing them to fall into the pool underneath. As the guests rush to the side of the pool to help them out, Levinson stumbles to the open panel and presses a couple of buttons that make more parts of the floor retract and send many of the would-be-rescuers into the pool themselves.Meanwhile, Clutterbuck's daughter Molly (Kathe Green) arrives at the party, along with her friends and an elephant painted with hippie slogans over its body and ""THE WORLD IS FLAT"" on its forehead. Alice, already distraught after the commotion involving the dance troupe, walks alongside the pool unaware that the elephant is following her. When she turns around and sees it, she screams and falls into the pool, and Molly and her friends jump in to get her out.

The first hint that all may not be what it seems, is when Ned refers to his wife Lucinda and the two couples exchange puzzled glances, but continue to talk as normal, discussing other neighbours; The Grahams who have installed a new swimming pool.This plants an idea in Ned mind; to swim home using a string of pools across the county to his house. He explain the route will take him via pools of the The Grahams, The Lears, The Bunkers, a portage through the Patisons riding ring, to the Hallorans and the Gilmartins. Then down to the Biswangers, Shirley Abbots, across route 424 to the public pool and then up the hill and home. He exclaims he will call it the Lucinda river, after his wife. As he departs, Helen Westerhazy poses the question; ""Swim to his house, now why would he want to do that?""Next Ned arrives at the pool of Howard (Howie) and Betty Graham. In the initial conversation with Betty, she explains how expensive the new pool was to get installed, but hints that money was no object since Howie is doing so well in his work. In the course of conversation with Betty it transpires that, when younger, Ned didn't think much of Howie and didn't believe he would succeed. Ned brushes this off as jealousy, saying it was because he was crazy about Betty, even though it emerges he was dating his future wife Lucinda at the time of Betty and Howard's wedding. Howie arrives on a new fangled, ride on lawnmower, which Ned feels compelled to fix the engine idle on.The talk turns to Ned's home, as Howie asks why he never put in a pool? Howie speculates that the house is probably still worth much more than Ned paid for it, with the tennis courts and all the planting done. Ned doubts whether he'll ever sell it and says he wants to see his girls married in the house, which causes puzzled glances between Howie and Betty. The arrival of the The Grahams offers a welcome distraction for an embarrassed Howie and Betty, who go to meet their guests as Ned resumes his swim.In the next scene, Ned emerges from the pool of the Lears to be greeted by a very hostile woman called Mrs Hammar. When she enquires what he is doing there, he tells her he is Ned Merril, a friend of her son Eric. When Ned inquires about her son it transpires that Eric is now dead and Ned didn't even visit him in hospital when he was in his final illness. Shocked at this revelation, Ned makes to leave, but is stopped by Mrs Hammar, who tells him that this is now her property and he is never to visit again.At this stage, it is becoming obvious that Ned is in severe denial, or is obviously running from a lot of things in his past. However, on spying a stallion in the distance, he soon recovers his old virile demeanour while racing against the horse.He next arrives at the pool of the Bunkers, where he meets 20 year old Julie Anne Hooper who, it transpires, used baby-sit his girls. He is amazed to see her all grown up and wonders why he doesn't see her anymore. To which she replies that they obviously don't need her (as the girls are now grown up). Nonetheless, Ned tries to book her for babysitting for the following Sunday night, which Julie thinks is a joke. The arrival of Julie's brother and his girlfriend adds a bit more to Ned's back story, where we learn he used drive a red Jaguar sports car and his daughter's names were Ellen and Aggie.Ned's enthusiasm about his swim entices Julie to join him and so they set off for the next pool. Along the way Ned remarks on the apparent changing of the season by referencing the flowers in bloom. Julie then confesses that she had a crush on Ned as a young babysitter to the extent that she once stole one of his shirts to wear.They arrive at the pool of the Bunkers where a party is ongoing. Ned is again greeted enthusiastically by many of the guests, even thought one of the ladies inquires if it is undiplomatic to ask about Lucinda, a question which Ned ignores. More hints of Ned former life of yachting and drinking Dom Perignon champagne are revealed. Julie becomes somewhat more flirtatious in a bid to show how grown up she's become. Another somewhat drunken male guest corners Ned to apologise for not calling him and says that he thinks it was a rotten thing for Ned to be ousted from his job like that by some new firecracker. Ned deflects the conversation and moves on with Julie to encounter yet another of his past conquests, a divorcee, Cynthia, who witheringly tries to dismisses Julie as competition. When Cynthia seductively invites Ned over to visit, he says he will need to discuss it with Lucinda which disgusts Cynthia. Another guest, Danny offers Ned the prospect of a new position, which Ned rejects dismissively when told he may have to take a cut in pay.As Danny tells Ned he doesn't have to pretend with him, Ned and Julie resume their swim and then move on to the Patisons riding ring. There Ned again impresses Julie with his athletic virility by jumping over the horse jumps, before over reaching himself and hurting his ankle in the process. Julie tells Ned some more about herself, which leads Ned to come on to her. Ned reveals that he married into money, that he was from humble origins and it was Lucinda who was rich. He then revisits the subject of his stolen shirt and possessively offers to be Julie's guardian angel, which spooks Julie and she runs off.Ned limps along a road alone and finds himself at the entrance to the Hallorans estate, just as a chauffeur driven Rolls Royce is driving in. Thinking he knows the chauffeur, he bums a ride, only to discover that the former chauffeur Steve has left. However, the new chauffeur also calls him by name. On the drive up to the house he discover the new chauffeur has been in his position for almost two years. He is the epitome of discretion (unlike, it would appear, Steve) and refuses to engage in discussion about Steve or much else either. Ned leaves the car at the front of the house and brings the newspaper for the Hallorans out to their pool at the rear.Sitting by their pool, it is soon obvious that the Hallorans are nudists. Mr Halloran is engaged in a conversation with their daughter on the phone, who obviously disapproves of their nudism and refuses to bring their grandchildren to visit unless the older couple put on clothes. As Ned approaches he removes his swimming trunks out of respect, while the Hallorans argue about refusing him if he asks for money. The three exchange petty conversation, which mainly reflects the Hallorans snobbery and the value they place on maintaining their privacy. Ned notices Mrs Halloran is organizing a safari benefit ball and tells her to put him down for a table. She balks and tells him a table costs $1,000. Mr Halloran interjects to tell Ned he was awfully sorry they couldn't be of help. When Ned replies he didn't recall asking for help Mr Halloran diverts by inquiring how Lucinda and the girls are. Chillingly, Ned retorts that Lucinda is fine and the girls are at home playing tennis and then takes his leave to go swim in the pool. As he leaves, Mrs Halloran removes his name from the list for the ball.Next Ned approaches the Gilmartins where he encounters a young boy (Kevin Gilmartin, Jr. ""after my father"") selling lemonade and practicing playing a recorder. Ned asks for a cup of lemonade and Kevin tells him it costs 10 cents. Ned tells him he'll owe it to him, but Kevin is skeptical, even when Ned says he'll drop it round to him tomorrow. Kevin relents however and gives Ned a cup, commenting that he is shivering. Ned inquires about Kevin's parents. He says his mother is in Europe on her honeymoon, so she couldn't take him and his father is in love with the manicurist (that's what his mother says). Ned notices the boy is lonely and says he'll invite him over to his house and he can play with Ned's girls who he says are not much older than Kevin. Kevin is excited at the prospect of this and of cycling his English racing bike. He offers Ned another drink but Ned says he hasn't time as he is swimming home. He asks Kevin if it is ok to use his pool and Kevin says yes but hesitates. Ned walks him up to the house, where he discovers the pool is empty. Kevin says they took the water out of the pool because he's not a good swimmer. Ned say he will pretend to swim the pool using all the strokes and invites Kevin to join him. While going up and down the length of the pool, Ned paints a glorious picture of himself, to Kevin, as a wonderful dad who floods the tennis courts in winter to turn them into a skating rink and says Kevin will have to join them next winter. Kevin is delighted at his achievement of having ""swum"" a full length of the pool. Then he begins to have doubts, but Ned tells him, if you believe in something enough, then it can be true. Kevin asks to do it again but Ned says he has to leave, at which point Kevin gets angry as everyone appears leaves him. As he walks into the forest Ned hears Kevin jumping on the diving board above the empty pool and returns, worried that Kevin will hurt himself. Kevin is puzzled when Ned says he was worried he might dive in, to which Kevin replies ""but there's no water in the pool"".Next, Ned arrives at the Biswangers, where yet another party is in full swing pool side, with people dancing, drinking and gorging themselves on caviar. Henry Biswanger is explaining to an audience of other men about the all-weather sliding cover over his pool, which will allow its use all through the year. Grace Biswanger greets Ned coldly, accusing him of gate crashing their party. Ned goes to get a drink and strikes up conversation with the bartender, saying he must be new, explaining he hasn't seen him at parties. The bartender replies that he hasn't seen Ned either. Another female guest, Joan, arrives to jump the bar queue before Ned. He talks with her about swimming. Joan asks is he a neighbour and Ned replies ""No"". She asks if he is a friend of the Biswangers, Ned replies that they are not even on his Christmas card list. He tries to entice Joan to come along with him, telling her he is noble and a very special human being. Another male guest arrives and takes Joan aside, obviously to explain to her who Ned really is. Ned jumps in the pool to swim a length and emerges at the other end as one of the catering staff wheels a hot dog wagon past. Ned recognises it as one he built for his kids. He gets quite emotional, loudly explaining its providence. Mrs Biswanger approaches angrily and explains that they bought it at a white elephant sale. Ned offers to buy it back, offering to send a check for whatever price they want, at which Mr Biswanger scoffs. When Ned threatens to make a bigger scene, Mr Biswanger tells him to leave. Ned does so, humiliated, but says Mr Biswanger will be hearing from his lawyer. As he limps away, all the party guests watch on.Ned next arrives at the pool of Shirley Abbot, an actress. When he tells her he is swimming home she tell him to grow up. It soon become obvious that Ned and Shirley have been lovers and that she has been hurt by Ned's behaviour in the past. When he tries to come on to her like old times she rejects him brutally. He tells her about the hot-dog wagon at the Biswangers and she asks how would she know it, that she's never been to his house. As he makes a drink, Ned exclaims to her that ""we are running out of Tabasco"". Shirley, irritated at his use of ""we"" says he is a little confused this afternoon, living in Never Never Land and inquires about his house (she's heard he's had a change of residence, which Ned denies) and Lucinda, whom she obviously dislikes. When Ned says Lucinda has always done a lot of good in the town, Shirley acidly replies that she just didn't do very good at home.
Ned begins to reminisce on their affair, recalling the previous winter in Toronto. Shirley replies that she hasn't been in Toronto for 3 years. She tells Ned that she wants him to get out of her garden, he asks is it because she is expecting someone, another male? When she confirms this Ned is taken aback and Shirley asks him if he thinks she's been in a deep freeze while he's been playing happy families. For the first time, we begin to see a real chink in Ned's facade, as he asks her what's happened and says that nothing's worked out the way he thought it would. She replies that he got turned out of his golden playpen. Shirley tells a story of once going to spy on Ned and his family on their way to the ballet and watching him schmoozing, smilingly with the hoi polloi, when hypocritically, one hour previously, he had been in bed with her. When he asks if her new man is better in bed than him she throws a drink in his face. Then she relates how he broke up with her by bringing her to a posh New York restaurant hoping she wouldn't make a scene. She says he sold her the yarn about having to go back to his wife and kids, even though he didn't love his wife (but the real estate was in her name!). She then mocks him about her affair with a bell hop to spite him further. He tries to entice her to come away with him to a castle in Ireland, but she again replies that she wants him to leave. He attempts to placate her and says he never meant to hurt her. His increasing shivers cause Shirley some genuine concern and she offers to drive him home. But he refuses and repeats the mantra that Lucinda is waiting for him, and the girls are at home playing tennis, as Shirley stares on in disbelief.
Ned draws her into the pool and tries to remove her swimming costume, but finally Shirley breaks and tells Ned what she really though about him; that he was a bore with his stories about his old deals and his old girls and his golf scores and his war stories. To Ned's dismay she says she was acting with him all the time, but he still tries to convince himself that she is lying and she loved it all.Struggling out of the pool, Ned is next confronted by route 424 and struggles to cross the six lanes of traffic, like a wounded animal. When he eventually succeeds he slinks away into the woods on the other side.Ned's next stop is the public pool where he pleads to be allowed enter, even though he doesn't have the 50 cents entry fee. He's resorting to begging when another couple approach and the man, Howie recognises Ned. Ned asks him if he will lend him the 50 cents and even though Howie's wife advises against it, Howie gives it to him. Ned is further humiliated by the pool staff, by being sent to take a shower and even being sent back again to wash his still dirty feet. Even then, he is subject to a careful inspection of his toes, akin to a criminal, before he is finally allowed to swim.He struggles to swim a single length of a pool crammed with other users and emerges seemingly exhausted by the effort. He is again confronted by Howie and his wife, along with another couple who are also less than impressed to see him. Howie's wife, frustrated at Howie's attempt at friendliness towards Ned, instead asks him when he is going to pay his bills? She is joined by the other couple, who echo the same sentiments. Ned promises to send them both a check the next day, which invites further scorn. The second male starts talking about the ostentatious orders he used deliver to Ned's house. Ned asks Howie how is his family and Howie begins to tell him about how well his oldest boy is doing, but is interrupted by his wife who says that they know how to bring their kids up right, Not like Ned, where it appears one of his daughters has been caught drink driving and Ned paid to keep her name out of the papers. Howie's wife continues to plunge the knife in further when Ned claims that his daughters worship him, by saying they laughed about him behind his back and when Ned accuses her of being a liar, Howie finally cracks and tells Ned the obvious truth, that his girls thought he was one big joke.
Stunned at this revelation, Ned pushes Howie aside and climbs up a rocky slope to escape the pool compound and their mocking of him.Ned finally arrives at the entrance to his own house and pushes his way in through the rusted gates as thunder crashes above. He limps into an unkempt and overgrown garden. As he walks through the dilapidated tennis courts, rain starts to fall and autumn leaves are piled in heaps. He approaches a once obviously grand, but now deserted house. He tries the front door but it is locked. He begins to bang on the door as rain falls in sheets and is blown by the wind. Through a crack in one of the windows we get a view inside one of the rooms of the house, empty save for some discarded boxes and an old tennis racket.This is revealed as Ned's true reality, that of the broken man slumped outside as the rain pours down on him."
If....,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063850/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In this allegorical story, a revolution led by pupil Mick Travis takes place at an old established private school in England. In an indictment of the British public school system, we follow Mick and his mostly younger friends through a series of indignities and occasionally abuse as any fond feelings toward these schools are destroyed. When Mick and his friends rebel, violently, the catch phrase, ""which side would you be on"" becomes quite stark.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Mick Travis Is In his final year at public school, and hates every minute of it; the outdated traditions, the beatings from the teachers, the silliness of the games they're forced to play, Younger students are bullied by older ones, and the teaching staff bullies them all. When the opportunity arises, MIck and his friends have a surprise for parents and other guests.—garykmcd Set in a British independent boys boarding school in the late 1960s (most of the scenes were filmed at Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire, with the remainder at Uppingham School in Rutland and Aldenham School in Hertfordshire, England, UK). Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) is one of three non-conformist boys among the returning class. They are watched and persecuted by the ""Whips"", senior boys given authority as 'prefects' over juniors. The prefects are entitled to the services of ""Scum"", who are first-year boys assigned to run errands, make tea and generally act as unpaid servants. This refers to the old tradition of ""fagging"" which still persisted in many British independent boys' schools.The early part of the film shows scenes in the school as the pupils return at the start of a new term. Mick Travis, the protagonist, arrives with a suitcase on his shoulder, wearing a black Derby hat, with a black scarf across his face to hide his moustache. Stephans comments, ""God, it's Guy Fawkes back again"", hinting at the conclusion of the film. Rowntree (Robert Swann) is the Head Whip, and he revels in his power, ordering the junior boys to ""Run! Run in the corridor!""After the first evening meal, the Whips conduct some of the more mundane business of the school, signing up boys for ""Confirmation class"" and ""VD clinic"". Each boy has to lower his pants so the school nurse can inspect his genitals.These early scenes show the school's customs and traditions. The Headmaster (Peter Jeffrey) is somewhat remote from the boys and the House Masters. Mr. Kemp (Arthur Lowe), the House Master to Mick's dorm, is told ""I'll have to get back to you on that"" when he brings things to the Headmaster's attention. Kemp himself is easily manipulated by the Whips into giving them a free hand in enforcing discipline. Some of the staff are shown as suffering from various perversions. For example, the school chaplain (Geoffrey Chater), who is also the geometry master, enjoys grasping the boys and hurting them during class. At bedtime, Mr. Kemp sings a hymn as his wife (Mary MacLeod) accompanies him on the recorder; the matron (Mona Washbourne), overhearing, is driven to near orgasm. Mrs. Kemp herself enjoys walking naked through the boys' dormitory and washroom while fondling soap, towels and other objects the boys have carelessly strewn about.One day, having sneaked off campus and into the nearby town (an act strictly forbidden by house rules), Mick steals a motorbike from a showroom and has an affair with a local waitress. Meanwhile, Wallace finds adolescent romance with Bobby Philips, a junior boy, whom he takes to bed. They indulge in self-inflicted ordeals, such as seeing how long they can hold a plastic bag over their faces.As the film progresses, it concentrates on Mick's group and their clashes with the school authorities. Mick and his friends are subject to punishments, and eventually they are sentenced to corporal punishment in the form of a severe ""beating"" (i.e. a caning) by the Whips. The caning is administered by Rowntree in the gym with a long run-up. The three boys are left with bleeding buttocks. Mick's punishment is especially brutal (10 strokes), yet tradition demands that he shake hands when it is over and say, ""Thank you"".(Note: scenes are shot through with surreal elements, such as some scenes being shot in black and white. This was not for dramatic emphasis, as people presumed, but simply because the huge windows at the college gave off obstructing light that affected the camera lenses. Another explanation given later by Lindsay Anderson is simply that the production was running out of money.)A few days later, during a paramilitary exercise training in the nearby woods, Mick and his friends play a practical joke on the Whips by planting a bomb containing paint which they detonate and humiliate the Whips and the supervisors of the military exercise. As a result, Mick and his friends are punished by being forced to clean up the church basement for the weekend. During the cleaning, Mick and his group find a large cache of various weapons dating back to the second world war (rifles, heavy machine guns, sub-machine guns, pistols, grenades and even mortar tubes with live rounds). Mick decides to use this to get revenge against the establishment for their misfortune.At the climax, in a surreal sequence, on Founders' Day, when parents are visiting the school, Mick and his group start a fire under the hall, smoke out the parents, staff and boys, and open fire on them from a rooftop. Led by the visiting General who was giving the speech, the staff and boys break open the Combined Cadet Force armoury and fire back.The Headmaster tries to stop the firefight and calls for peace. Mick's girl, who is on the roof with them, produces a Webley Revolver from her belt and shoots the Headmaster through the forehead in cold blood. As the battle continues, the camera closes in on Mick's face as he defiantly keeps firing, ending the film with a fade-out and an echo of gunfire with the film's title ""if...."" emblazoned in red on the screen."

Targets,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063671/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An aging horror star questions his place in modern Hollywood, while a disturbed young man goes on a killing spree. Byron Orlok is an old horror-movie star who feels that he is an anachronism. Compared to real-life violence, his films are tame. Meanwhile, Bobby Thompson goes on a killing spree...—Gary Couzens <gjcouzens@btinternet.com> Peter Bogdanovich's debut feature is a thinly disguised account of ex-marine Charles Whitman, who, after murdering his mother and his wife, armed himself with a number of rifles and handguns and on a sunny 1966 Texas morning, began a shooting spree that killed 14 people and wounded 32 people. Bogdanovich's version tells two stories concurrently, about an aging horror-film star who feels that his type of movie monster has become passé, and the other about a father-hating gun freak who goes on a rampage to get even with his dad by shooting at people from the top of a water tower and then from behind a drive-in movie screen.—alfiehitchie A movie clip from the film 'The Terror' is shown (the climatic flooding scene at the end featuring actors Boris Karloff, Dick Miller, Jack Nicholson, etc.). The clip ends with the final fade out and it is being shown in a small screening room somewhere in Hollywood. The elderly star of the film, Byron Orlock (Boris Karloff), tells the producer Marshall Smith (Monty Landis) that he has decided to retire from acting because he considers his performance no longer frightening in mainstream society. Marshall and the film's director Sammy Michaels (director Peter Bogdanovich) try to convince him to appear in their next film, but Orlok refuses and plans to return to his native England to live out the rest of his days, and refuses to even read the new script that Sammy gives to him. Orlok walks out with his young secretary Jenny (Nancy Hsueh), whom is Sammy's current girlfriend. Sammy follows him outside to persuade him to stay in Hollywood, but Orlok tells Sammy that he considers himself to be an anachronism because people are no longer frightened by horror pictures. ""The world belongs to the young. Let them have it"", says Orlock.Across the street, a young man named Bobby Thompson (Tim O'Kelly) is seen buying a high-powered semi-automatic .303 caliber hunting rifle and pays with it by check. He goes out to the parking lot to his white convertible and places the newly purchased rifle in his car truck which has more then a dozen firearms of various calibers. Bobby drives along a freeway listening to the car radio and munching on Baby Ruth candy bars. He arrives home in a suburb of the San Fernando Valley where he lives with his wife Ilene (Tanya Morgan) and his parents and has dinner with them.Across town, Orlok is dining with Jenny at a local restaurant when his manager Ed Laughlin (Arthur Peterson) arrives and tries to persuade him to stay in town at least for a few days to attend the premier of 'The Terror' at a local Racine drive-in theater the following evening. But Orlok refuses and even refuses to speak to Marshall over a phone that Ed tries to set up.After dinner, Bobby and his father go out to a shooting range where they shoot at tin can targets. Bobby has a keen talent from shooting guns apparently due to his recent military service. Since Bobby still lives with his parents, its convenient for him and his father, Robert Thompson Sr., to go out shooting together. While his father is setting up more tin targets, Bobby, for some odd reason points his rifle at his father seemingly intent on shooting him. Robert Thompson sees Bobby aiming the rifle at him and orders him to put the rifle down, because pointing a gun a people goes against everything he has taught his son.That evening, Orlok is in his hotel suite with Jenny who is setting up his schedule for his return to England the following day. Jenny also tries to persuade Orlok to stay at least for the premier of his latest film, but Orlok tells her that he is through with the movie business and still refuses to read Sammy's script. Orlok then sends her home while he stays alone in his room to watch TV.At the Thompson house that evening, the whole family is watching TV together when Ilene says that she has to go to her night job as a switchboard operator. Bobby follows her to the bedroom and wants to talk to her saying that he has not been feeling well lately and has been getting ""funny ideas"". But since she is late for her job, she tells him that she doesn't have time to talk and leaves. He asks her not to take his car but take her mother's to work and she agrees. After Ilene leaves and his parents go to bed for the night, Bobby goes to his car and takes out one of his guns, a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol before returning to the house.At Orlok's hotel room, he orders room service and watches himself on one of his old movies 'The Criminal Code' that is playing as a late-night movie. Sammy arrives and demands that Orlok hand over his script and they both watch the movie together. Over drinks, Sammy again tries to convince Orlok to appear in his latest film because the script that he wrote will cast Orlok as a real-life person rather then a bogeyman. But the bitter Orlok announces that he is still fed up with the film business and shows Sammy that people are more frighted by the latest newspaper headings about crimes committed by random people then horror films. Sammy gets so drunk that he attempts to leave, but collapses and Orlok puts him in his own bed and soon afterwords also collapses drunk next to Sammy.Meanwhile at the Thompson house, Bobby is sitting alone in his bedroom chain smoking when Ilene returns home. His tone of voice is now very cold and he asks her not to turn on the lights because he has a headache. When she asks him what he wanted to talk to her about and why he is perplexed, he no longer wants to talk and asks her to go to bed.The next morning, after his father has apparently left for work, Bobby types out a note and when Ilene walks in the room, he suddenly takes out his .45 caliber gun and violently shoots her dead. When Bobby's mother runs into the room, he shoots her dead too. He then shoots an unfortunate grocery delivery man who enters the house. Bobby hides the bodies in rooms through the house, hides the bloodstains and leaves, leaving behind a note saying that he has killed his wife and mother and will continue killing until he is caught or killed.In Orlok's hotel suite, a hung-over Sammy wakes up and sees a sleeping Orlok next to him and jumps, waking him up. Sammy says that he was having a nightmare and woke up to see Byron Orlok. As Orlok gets up to answer a knock on his front door, he passes a mirror and he too jumps from his own reflection. Jenny has arrived with Orlok's internary with his airline tickets to New York as well as his tickets for the ship to take him back to England. However, Orlok finally agrees to make the final promotional appearance at the Racine Drive-In that evening for the premier of his latest film.Across town, Bobby arrives at another gun store and asks for 300 rounds of ammunition for his new rifle as well as box of 12-gauge buckshot for his double-barreled shotgun. Despite the fact that Bobby looks a little jittery and of the unusually large quantity of ammunition requested, the clerk sells him the ammunition. When the clerk asks Bobby about the order, Bobby tells him that he is going out to ""shoot some pigs.""In Orlok's hotel suite, he, Jenny, Sammy along with a brash radio disk jockey named Kip Larkin (Sandy Baron) discuss his appearance at the drive-in theater for that night and Orlok decides to reherse to them a ghost story that he plans to tell after the movie premier.Meanwhile, Bobby drives to an industrial center and after parking his car, pulls out of the trunk all of his guns in a large pouch and enters an abandoned amusement park that sits next to an oil storage tank facility where he scales a cynderblock wall and climbs up the stairs of one of the oil tanks that sits alongside a busy freeway. Bobby lays out all of his rifles and pistols that he brought with him as if displaying them for himself and then eats a sandwich and drinks soda pop that he also brought before taking am with his new high-powered rifle at motorists traveling along the road and opens fire, killing and/or wounding many in which some cars veer off the road. An oil company worker investigates the shooting, but Bobby kills him too with a blast from his shotgun as he is reloading. When Bobby hears police sirens and sees police cars approaching on the freeway, he grabs most of his guns and runs down the stairs and back to his car, but drops several of his weapons including his .45 pistol, an unused .44 magnum revolver, as well as his shotgun and a rifle and some boxes of ammunition. As Bobby drives away, a police car appears and give chase, but he eludes it by driving into the very same drive-in theater that is showing Orlok's 'The Terror' for that night. After reloading and having a meal from the concession stand, Bobby carries his remaining guns in his US Army pouch and walks through a door leading to the big screen.When it gets dark and the movie finally goes on, Bobby climbs up the structure and begins to shoot the viewers through a small hole in the screen. He first shoots a man in a telephone booth and then shoots people in their cars, on by one. He even shoots and kills the projectionist. Orlok arrives for his special appearance and the limo parks close to the screen. Meanwhile, many viewers start to leave because they realize that there is a sniper present. A traffic jam ensues. When Bobby pauses to reload, he accidentally knocks over his last few boxes of ammunition. Panicking, Bobby climbs down the screen and tries to retrieve the ammo from a drainage but without success.Some male viewers take guns from the trunks of their cars and charge towards the screen. Seeing the vigilante mob approach, Bobby runs to an area to the side of the screen and opens fire randomly. One of his shots seriously injures Jenny as she gets out of the limo. The police soon arrive as does Sammy and they try to find both Orlok and the sniper. Orlok angrily walks towards the screen as Bobby finally runs out of ammunition for his rifle and opens fire with one of his smaller pistols. He gets confused when he sees the Orlok character on the drive-in screen walking towards him and sees the real Orlok walking to him as well. Bobby first shoots Orlok, but misses and only gazes his forehead with the bullet. Bobby takes aim and shoots at the Orlok on the big screen. Blinded by police searchlights zeroing in on him, Bobby fires widely until he runs out of ammo. When Bobby takes out another one of his pistols, Orlok rushes up and knocks the gun out of Bobby's hand with his walking cane and beats Bobby with it as well as literally slapping him into submission. Bobby then cowers in fear as Orlok says, ""Is that what I was afraid of?"" Two policemen run up to the screen and arrest Bobby. As he is being led away, Bobby says to his police captors, ""I hardly ever missed, did I?"" Bobby is taken away in a police car while Sammy tends to Orlok and takes him away in his limo as the crowd of people and cars file out of the drive in theater.The final shot shows the deserted drive in theater the morning after which is now empty, except for Bobby's white car sitting alone in the empty lot as the end credits silently roll."
The Boston Strangler,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062755/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A series of brutal murders in Boston sparks a seemingly endless and increasingly complex manhunt. Boston is being terrorized by a series of seemingly random murders of women. Based on a true story, the film follows the investigators' path through several leads before introducing the Strangler as a character. It is seen almost exclusively from the point of view of the investigators who have very few clues to build a case upon.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In 1962, elderly women are being strangled to death in their homes in the metropolitan Boston area. Panic ensues not only in the general population, but also within the police forces in the Boston area; they begin to apprehend and question every known sexual criminal. Things for the police departments start to get out of control when subsequent stranglings extend to younger women. To show the public that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is taking the matter seriously, the state attorney general appoints law professor John S. Bottomly to lead a multi-jurisdictional task force to apprehend the perpetrator. Bottomly feels ill-equipped to do so. Eventually he and his team come across two leads: one a victim, Dianne Cluny, who survives her strangling, and the other a man named Albert DeSalvo being detained for a seemingly unrelated crime. Bottomly notices that DeSalvo, who is institutionalized when he is diagnosed with a possible case of dissociative identity disorder, has an injury matching one that Cluny inflicted on the strangler. Beyond his mental disorder, DeSalvo seems like a decent man. Regardless, Bottomly wants to find out conclusively if DeSalvo is indeed the strangler, even if he will never be tried for the crimes, and even if it causes DeSalvo possible permanent injury to his psyche.—Huggo"

"Rachel, Rachel",1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063483/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Rachel is a lonely school teacher who lives with her mother. When a man from the big city asks her out, she starts thinking about where she wants her life to go. Thirty-five year old spinster and virgin Rachel Cameron is a sad, lonely woman. She lives in the small town of Japonica, Connecticut where she grew up. She teaches second grade at Japonica Elementary School and lives with her highly demanding widowed mother (her funeral director father passed away fourteen years ago) in the same apartment above a funeral home where she grew up, despite the home now not being owned by them. Rachel often uses her mother as an excuse not to do things. Rachel represses her emotions, and is prone to daydreaming to envision alternate paths for herself in certain situations if she only had the nerve to do those things. Even when Nick Kazlik, a childhood acquaintance who has returned to Japonica for a summer visit with his family, makes it clear that he wants to have fun with her while he's in town, she can't act on his request out of fear of the unknown. But after a couple of incidents with her only real friend Calla Mackie, who is a fellow teacher at the school, Rachel begins to allow herself more freedom. But as Rachel's repressions slowly melt away, how her emotions will manifest themselves becomes the question.—Huggo Rachel Cameron (Joanne Woodward) is a shy, 35-year-old spinster schoolteacher living with her widowed mother in a small apartment above a funeral home that was once owned by her late father in a small town in Connecticut. Haunted by memories of her unhappy childhood and her mortician father, Rachel spends each frustrating day taking care of her mother and working with the schoolchildren. School is soon let out for summer vacation and Rachel figures it will just be another lonely and boring summer for her. (It's implied that she may even hate summer as her job provided somewhat of an escape from her domineering mother who's always trying to compare her to her sister, who married a successful businessman in Boston.)Rachel's closest friend is Calla Mackie (Estelle Parsons), a fellow unmarried teacher who persuades her to attend a revival meeting, where a visiting preacher, named Reverend Wood, encourages Rachel to express her need for the love of Jesus Christ. Rachel is overwhelmed by God's grace, baring so much pent-up emotion, that she is humbled after the service. While comforting Rachel, Calla suddenly begins to kiss Rachel passionately. (It is never explained if Calla is a lesbian, bisexual, or if she merely reacted to the emotion of the moment.) Rachel's reaction is to withdraw from the friendship for the time being.Note: Brief daydreaming sequences of the adult Rachel also appear, including those showing her imagining seizing a stolen moment with the school's possibly sexual-harassing principal; taking an under-loved boy in her classroom home with her; and rocking an expected baby in a park while children play nearby.Rachel realizes that only by exposing herself to life is the way she can she experience it. She therefore gives herself to a former high school friend, named Nick Kazlik (James Olsen), who is in town for a visit with his parents which she and he sleep together after first meeting. Mistaking her first sexual encounter for love, she fantasizes about a future with Nick. Her hopes are shattered, however, when Nick, put off by her seriousness, abruptly ends their affair.A short time later, Rachel discovers that she may be pregnant. Determined to accept the consequences of her actions, she decides to go away and have the child. After Calla has helped her find a teaching post in Oregon, Rachel learns that her pregnancy is merely a cyst requiring minor surgery. After undergoing surgery to have the cyst removed, she tells her mother, in the hospital, that she has decided to relocate, and that her mother may accompany her or not, as she wishes. Her mother quickly agrees to go, in a way that suggests she realizes her dependence on Rachel and perhaps even will take her less for granted from now on. Rachel sets out with hope for the future, having learned that she has choices, that she is able to give and receive sexual pleasure, that it is possible for her to take on life actively, rather than wait for it to find her. In the final scene, as Rachel leaves town with her somewhat reluctant mother and looks for the last time at the familiar sights of her home town, she speculates on what the future may bring."

Checking the torpedo tube, a slight trickle of seawater is noted draining from it, but all indicators show clear. The hatch is hard to open, and as the crewman thrusts against the handle, it suddenly slams open, ice-cold seawater flooding the torpedo room.Fighting for their lives, the men struggle to close the outer hatch while Ferraday orders engines full astern, hoping to prevent the crippled boat from heading for the bottom. Pumping pressurized air into the flooded forward rooms and red-lining the engines does little, and the Tigerfish plummets deeper and deeper into the darkness. Passing far below their dive limit, the outer torpedo door finally begins to close, and once sealed the boat slows its deadly descent. At extreme depth, and withstanding incredible pressures, they manage to halt the dive, and slowly head back up. Badly shaken, they are further stunned at Jones' claim that this was no accident. Someone very capable had sabotaged the tube controls, and tried to murder them all.Ferraday has had enough of Jones and Vaslov's cloak-and-dagger tactics and demands to know what the hell they are really doing here. ""You seem to know an awful lot about the business of operating a submarine"", snarls Ferraday.""I know how to wreck them,"" replies Jones, shivering under a blanket. Jones angrily demands that Ferraday blast open the ice and get him to Zebra, but furious that one of his crewmen is now dead, Ferraday refuses and demands Jones come clean on his real mission. The sonar man breaks in to report they are now under Zebra's position. Disgusted, Ferraday leaves for the control room.With consummate skill, the crew locate and surface through a relatively thin layer of ice, exposing the submarine's conning tower to the blast of an Arctic ice storm. Quickly taking a fix in Zebra's weak signal, a rescue team sets out across the rugged ice pack, led by Jones, Vaslov and Ferraday. Only a few miles need to be covered, but the way is filled with danger, and several men are nearly lost when an unseen crevasse opens up at their feet. Tied together for safety, the other manage to pull the trapped men out, but back at the Tigerfish, the ice pack is shifting, squeezing the submarine. Unable to contact Zebra or the rescue party, they are forced to submerge once more.As they near the station, Jones can smell burned rubber in the tearing wind. Finally stumbling into the camp, they see through the storm that the station is in a shambles. Several of the huts are wrecked or burned, and there seem to be no survivors. Cautiously searching the huts they find one is still intact and sheltering a few numbed, barely alive scientists, and these are quickly warmed and revived. Jones and Vaslov both find familiar faces and begin to probe for answers as to what happened, but the frozen men are still too much in shock to provide any information. Leaving the scientists to the rescue team, Jones begins to hunt through the rest of the camp, desperately searching for something. In what's left of the laboratory, he turns to find Ferraday watching him.""What size is the film?"" Ferraday asks.Surprised, Jones replies that it's a standard film canister, ""And all of a sudden, you know a whole damn lot about my business."" Ferraday confesses that he has been briefed on the real nature of their mission, despite all the precautions taken by Jones, so he continues to elaborate. The film he's searching for came from a Russian spy satellite, equipped with a special camera stolen from the British, and using a new type of film developed by the Americans, ""all very hush-hush,"" says Jones. Launched by the Russians, it was capable of taking pictures of incredible detail, and it had photos of all missile bases in North America. Unfortunately for the Russians, something went wrong, ""and that darling little satellite just kept on taking pictures of Soviet missile bases, even when it wasn't supposed to, making it the most valuable piece of film in the world."" Attempting a recovery, the satellite merely shifted to a new polar orbit, meaning that the only choice the Russians had to bring it down was over the North Pole. The British sent an agent up to Zebra, as did the Russians, and the satellite was brought down. ""Then disaster, fire, silence,"" mused Jones, ""and here we are. No agents, no clues, and no film."" As they think about their next move, a deathly silence settles over the camp: the storm is finally dying down.Ferraday uses an ice drill from the tool shed, and has his men drill a small hole in the ice a short distance from the camp. Dropping a transponder down the hole, they are quickly located by the Tigerfish which surfaces through the ice a few minutes later. ""I want a hundred men out here on the double,"" orders Ferraday. The entire crew is sent out through the camp and across the ice, looking for the hidden film. Meanwhile Jones has discovered a homing device hidden in the fuel tank of the camp's tractor, and he turns to leave the hut.A crowbar strikes him across the chest, flinging him back across the room and knocking him out. The attacker cautiously approaches and pulls his hood back; it is Vaslov, the Russian defector, and Jones' supposed friend. Now revealed as a double-agent, he takes the homing device to search for the hidden film but is caught by the Captain of the marine platoon, and they fight to the death. Just as the marine gains the advantage, shots ring out and he falls to the floor, dead. Jones had come to and shot the marine, thinking he was the traitor. Ferraday and the others hear the shots and come running in before Vaslov can regain the homing device, and he quickly re-assumes his old character. As the others take the homer out to search, Ferraday looks over the fight scene with suspicion. Re-checking the tractor fuel tank, he finds another device wrapped in plastic.The homer quickly finds the film canister, buried in the ice a few yards from the camp. Torches are brought out to melt the ice away, but another problem looms. The clearing storm has allowed the Russians to fly over the camp and drop a squadron of paratroops to take the camp and the film by force. As the Russians approach the camp, Ferraday orders most of the men back into the submarine. The Russian Captain steps quietly up to the edge of the camp, and calmly asks for Ferraday by name, claiming the satellite is Soviet property and stating that they wish only to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. A tense situation ensues, and Ferraday stalls for time while the canister is melted out of the ice. A tricky self-destruct device had been attached to the canister, making things even more difficult. The Russian captain gives Ferraday two minutes to turn over the canister.Vaslov, still playing the double agent, disarms the small bomb and opens the canister removing the priceless film. Still shaky, Jones walks up behind and observes. Ferraday calmly re-arms the bomb and carries the canister to the Russian captain, tossing it lightly to him. But the captain is no fool, he too disarms the bomb and checks the canister and when he finds it is empty, an order is barked and the Russians open fire.Smoke bombs are fired into the camp, filling the air with dense fog and hiding everything. Vaslov sees his chance in the confusion, and runs for the Russian troops outside the camp. Another man looms up in his path: Jones. Smiling grimly at each other, they both realize the charade is over, and they begin a fight to the death as machine gun fire whistles all around them. As the smoke clears and everyone is ordered to hold their fire, Vaslov is lying on the ice and Jones is holding the film.Covered by the Russians, Jones cannot escape. Ferraday takes control of the situation and orders Jones to drop the film. Shooting a venomous look at Ferraday, Jones is forced to toss the film at the Russians in defeat. The film is quickly returned to the canister, still attached to its self-destruct unit, and run up a thin line attached to a weather balloon for collection by a circling Russian plane. As the aircraft approaches, Ferraday turns his hand and reveals the object he'd found hidden in the fuel tank: a remote trigger for the self-destruct unit on the canister. Jones looks at the device and then at Ferraday, understanding dawning on his face.Just as the Soviet plane swoops down to snare the canister, Ferraday triggers the bomb. In a brilliant flash, the capsule and its film are destroyed, startling everyone. The Russian captain looks across to Ferraday, also beginning to understand. Stepping back across the ice, they contemplate each other for a moment.""Our mission here is completed"" he says, ""at least in part.""""Agreed"", replies Ferraday. With the precious film now gone, both sides realize it is time to leave. The Americans move to pick up their wounded, and Ferraday tells the Russian that ""you sir, may pick up your man"", indicating Vaslov, still laying on the ice. They separate, and make ready to depart.The Tigerfish, carrying the Zebra survivors and wounded marines, submerges once more and begins its long voyage back home."

Danger: Diabolik,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062861/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A master thief and his sensual lover pull off heist after heist, all while an envious coalition of cops and gangsters is gunning for them. In psychedelic swinging 60s style, the dreaded thief Diabolik wreaks havoc on a generic European country for his own financial gain and amusement. He shares an extravagant underground lair (and a giant bed of money) with his curvaceous, beautiful girlfriend...who uses her awesome powers to help Diabolik foil gangsters and steal billions from the government. As the anti-hero of the film, Diabolik must face off against bumbling cops and revenge-seeking mafiosi.—Michael ""Rabbit"" Hutchison <rabhutch@spacestar.net> In a generic European country of the late 60's, Diabolik is an anti-hero whose life consists on preparing schemes to steal government money and make a fool of the entire police department. Helped by his gorgeous girlfriend Eva, Diabolik begins by stealing a few dollars, but his duel of wit and audacity with police inspector Ginko will take them both to some extreme consequences. Based on the Italian comic books by sisters Angela and Luciana Giussani.—Daniel Poeira In a nameless European country, Inspector Ginco (Michel Piccoli) takes every precaution to ensure that a $1,000,000 shipment of money reaches a local bank. Despite having decoy armored trucks, the real one containing the money is sidetracked to a marina where a masked career thief, known only as Diabolik (John Phillip Law) steals the whole truck by lifting up by an electric magnet and dropping it into the water, where he dives in and retrieves the money. In a long chase, Diabolik eludes the police by switching cars with his mistress and partner-in-crime, Eva Kant (Marisa Mell) who drives Diabolik back to his hideout, a remote cave in a mountain side which has miles of underground passageways, and their living quarters is a mod of various expensive designed bought with their ill gotten money.Having heard of the latest robbery by the masked thief, the Minister of the Interior (Terry Thomas) arranges for a press conference. But Diabolik and Eva sneak into the conference disgused as reporters where, using their flash bulbs on their camera, they set off some 'exhilarating gas'. When the Minister informs the press of this latest theft and preaching to the reporters that he is not to be made a fool of, the Minister is reduced to just that when the gas reduces everyone in the room to hysterical laughter, while Diabolik and Eva quietly leave unnoticed.Following the press conference, Inspector Ginco attempts to resign. But his boss (Claudio Gora) refuses to accept his resignation. Ginco reluctantly agrees to stay on the police force, and is subsequently put in charge of the current plan to put all criminals behind bars. With tireless precision, Ginco and his men clean up the city. Mobsters are put behind bars, and then executed. When a drug den is raided, the jaded hippies and drug addicted are carted off.Ralph Valmont (Adolfo Celi), the head of a large crime syndicate which is responsible for most of the murders and drug trafficking in the country, learns about the raid on one of his establishments, and makes contact with Inspector Ginco. In exchange for his life, Valmont promises to help Ginco capture Diabolik.When the visiting British finance minister and his wife are honored at a gala party in a large castle by the beach, the press, encouraged by Ginco, play up the wifes recent acquisition of a rare emerald necklace, which is to be unveiled at the celebration. Ginco knows that Diabolik will not pass up the chance to steal the valuable jewelry, so he and his men lay in wait all around the castle for Diabolik to show up. Diabolik does show up, by scaling the seaside wall of the castle to the living quarters of the finance minister's wife where he steals the necklace, and makes another clever escape by constructing a makeshift catapult, but tricks Gino and the police into thinking he used it to eject himself to safety, when he really hides underneath it and simply walks out of the castle dressed as a policeman.Meanwhile, Valmont and henchmen recognize Eva at an Esso filling station, and they kidnap her. After making contact with Diabolik though a local newspaper, he promises to hand over the emerald necklace in exchange for Eva. Valmont wants to meet Diabolik aboard his private airplane. The following evening, Diabolik meets with Valmont's henchmen who herd him aboard Valmont's plane which takes off. But it is revealed that this is all part of Ginco's plan for once the plane reaches a destined spot, Valmont is to release a trap door on his plane which will literally drop Diabolik into the inspector's lap. But the plan backfires greatly when Diabolik figures out what is going on and in the subsequent shoot-out aboard the plane, Diabolik frees Eva, and he and Valmont stuggle in which they fall through the trapdoor, but Diabolik leaves behind a bomb which explodes, killing all of Valmont's henchmen. The three of them parachute to safely on the ground near the police rendezvous spot where in a continuation shoot-out, Diabolik kills Valmont by shooting him before apparently committing suicide when Ginco and the police close in on him.Ginco is saddened by Diabolik's death for he never got the chance to really arrest him. But Diabolik is not dead. During the shoot-out he took a drug which slowed down his heart and matabolsim to the point where he appeared dead. At the mourge, Eva, disguised as a nurse, arrives and administrates the antidote. Diabolik awakens, and kills the coroner before making his escape.Unaware of Diabolik's most recent escape, Gino is puzzled over the missing emeralds. Upon reading Valmont's death certificate, an idea puzzles him. All totaled, there are eleven emeralds missing. Valmont died form eleven bullet wounds. Ginco realizes that Diabolik is clever enough to use the jewels as bullets, therby proving a very safe hiding place for them. Ginco runs over to the crematorium to inspect Valmont's ashes. Diabolik, disguised as Valmont's elderly brother, has already arrived to lay claim to his brother's ashes. When the morgue attendant begins to scoop the ashes into a urn, he is shocked to find the emeralds. But before he can do anything, Diabolik knocks him out, and makes his escape with the emeralds. As usual, Ginco arrives at the morgue missing Diabolik by a matter of seconds.With no other alternatives open, the police offer a $1 million rewards to anybody to is able to lead them to Diabolik, Ginco realizes the foolishness of this plan, but his superiors refuse to listen him because of his string of bad luck in trying to catch Diabolik. Soon after, Diabolik sends a note to the government saying: ""in view of the bad use of the government is making of the public's money, I shall take steps to remove it from circulation."" In a matter of days, he blows up all tax offices, federal banks, and treasury buildings to smithereens. The former Minister of the Interior, now working as the Minister of Finance, makes another comic appearance on television where he reveals that with the destruction of the tax offices, the tax records of all citizens have been destroyed. He employs everybody to come forward voluntarily and pay the tax they think they owe. His speech elicts nothing but more laughter from the TV viewers.With the government now strapped for money, Ginco decides to put one last plan into action. He has the entire gold reserve melted down into a 20-ton ingot so that it can make up for the lost taxes. Yet he realizes that Diabolik is going to attempt to steal it too. Rather than be outwitted again, Ginco has the container of the gold partially 'radio activated'. In this way, once it is stolen, he will he able to use radioactive detectors to lead them to Diabolik's hideout, and leading him to all of Diabolik's stolen goods.The next day, the ingot is duly stolen by Diabolik who sabatoges the train carrying it by blowing up a railroad bridge, in which the railroad car containing the large ingot falls into the river. Diabolik and Eve, donning wet suites, then use inflatable underwater balloons to transport the large container though an underwater passage to their hideout.At Diabolik's hideout, he dons a protective heat suit and plans to melt down the gold into gold bricks. But as he's doing so, Ginco and his men follow their radiation tracker devices to the underground lair and make their entry. For the first time, Diabolik is caught off-guard by the advancing police, but not entirely unprepared as he decides to flood the entire cavern therby destroying himself and everyone in it. But unaware that the ingot container is partly radioactive, Diabolik leaves his electric drill on the container in which the extreme heat from the drill makes the container glow red hot. Just as Diabolik is about to pull a lever to flood the cavern, the container explodes, showering him in molten gold.The police are finally delighted to have finally disposed of Diabolik, and allow reporters and the public into Diabolik's cave to put on display Diabolik. But Ginco is not at all pleased by the decision to display the body, which now is a picturesque gold statue for the general public. The police and workers begin to haul all the stolen appliances and loot out of the cave. Later when the cavern is now deserted and empty, Eva, who had earlier fled at Diabolik's instance, comes out wearing a black funeral dress to play her respects to her lover. Ginco appears and places Eva under arrest, but allows her for a few minutes alone with the body. When Ginco leaves for a minute, a distraught Eva catches sight of Diabolik's still exposed left eye. Amazingly, it winks at her. The protective suit he is wearing has prevented him from being burned alive, though he is now trapped in his gold shell. The inspector arrives to take her away. Soon after they leave, a diabolical laugh rings out in the dark, empty cave."

With a mother who insists on treating him like a child, a stepfather who can't wait to see the back of him, and a brother with Down's Syndrome shut away in an institution, is it any wonder he retreats into an alternate personality - that of six-year-old Georgie? It is Georgie who befriends Susan Harper (Hayley Mills), but friendship soon turns into obsession.

Her divorced mother, Joan Harper (Billie Whitelaw), takes in boarders both as income and for company (in many aspects of the word) especially while Susan is away. Her two current boarders are crass Gerry Henderson (Barry Foster), with whom Joan does occasionally share her bed, and Indian national Shashie Kumar (Salmaan Peerzada), who works at a nearby teaching hospital as an intern. Martin presents himself to Susan as mentally slow ""Georgie Clifford"" - always referring to himself in the third person - who Susan takes under her wing as ""Georgie"", enacting an elaborate plan, does whatever he can to insinuate himself into Susan's life in his romantic infatuation with her. In Martin's psychopathy, he has the potential to harm anyone who frustrates him which thus places the lives of Susan and those around her in danger if they do anything against ""Georgie"".—Huggo The film opens with Martin Durney playing catch with his young mentally challenged brother, Pete, (whom suffers from Down Syndrome) at a special school in London. Martin is the only thread to Pete's family life; their father died years before and their mother has a new life with a new husband.

Certain that this was a misunderstanding, the manager lets them leave.Martin returns home to his parents arguing in the parlor over his lack of interest in life. There is allusion to some perverse behavior he has exhibited, though this is not elaborated upon. He shuts himself in his room. While secluded, Martin stares in the mirror, bare chested, examining his frame. He seems disappointed at his appearance, eventually punching and cracking the mirror in frustration. The camera reveals a stack of body building magazines on Martin's dresser.The next day, Martin goes to Susan's house and waits for her to return. She arrives with a young Indian man named Shashee. He drops off Susan, who thanks him, and she goes to the library, where she keeps an after-school job. There, Martin approaches Susan who immediately recognizes him as 'Georgie'.

Head,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063049/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Monkees are tossed about in a psychedelic, surrealist, plotless, circular bit of fun fluff. Running in from seemingly nowhere,Micky Dolenz,Davy Jones,Michael Nesmith&Peter Tork- better known collectively asThe Monkees- disrupt a bridge opening ceremony. From where and why did they come to disrupt the proceedings? They were filming a series of vignettes in several different genres, including a wild west sequence, a desert war sequence, a Confederate war sequence, and a science fiction sequence. They disagree with much of what is happening around them, and try to figure out how to escape the oppression they feel - symbolized by a big black box in which they are seemingly imprisoned - by the forces around. That oppression is often shown in the form of ""The BigVictor Mature"".—Huggo A film featuring The Monkees (Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Michael Nesmith and Micky Dolenz) is a variety of scenes and adventures. It starts with them disrupting a bridge opening ceremony and then goes from there, often in a mini-story featuring one of the band.—grantss In this 1968 film, the Monkees valiantly attempted to deflate their own myth. The plot is, essentially, about demystification. Mickey Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Mike Nesmith - with the aid of writer Jack Nicholson (the only credited author due to legalities)- tackle such topics as filmmaking, the media treatment and madness of the Vietnam War, Davy Jones' ""way with the ladies"", and, most importantly, commercialization. Each group member is presented in a unique light - in every case shattering the image that had been produced by the ""media machine"". The Monkees went out on a limb with this film by creating an almost surreal work with a loosely bound ""plot"". Their younger fans, unfortunately, simply missed the point. Because of the poor publicity of the film at the time of its release, older teenagers had no clue what ""Head"" was trying to say. As a result, its box office showing was disastrous. ""Head"" is more for the film enthusiast than the casual Monkees fan in some respects. The soundtrack does, however, feature some of the finest and most sophisticated music of the group's career. And yes, they DO play their own instruments on the tunes, but receive assistance in composing and performing from the likes of Neil Young, Stephen Stills, and Carole King.—Tony - Media Librarian, New York This movie 'Head' is about the nature of free will, conceived and edited in a stream of consciousness style with no plot at all.'Head' begins at the dedication of a bridge. As a local politician struggles with his microphone during the dedication speech, the ""wacky, fun-loving"" Monkees (Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Michael Nesmith), suddenly interrupt the ceremony by running through the assembled officials, to the sound of various horns and sirens....The rest of the film shows what happened that led up to that.Earlier... the four have just all kissed the same groupie, who tells them that they were indistinguishable. Throughout the film, they make their way both together and seperately through a series of unrelated vignettes, each being a different type of movie (a mystery, a war movie, a western, a desert adventure, etc...).One memorable segment shows Micky trecking alone through a vast desert until he finds a soft drink vending machine standing on top of a sand dune. He is overjoyed to find that it is not a mirage, and happy that he has spare change, but infurated when the machine takes his money and gives him nothing back, for the machine is out of order. Then a small group of heavily armed soldiers, complete with a tank and all, arrive to fight Micky for control of the vending machine until Micky subdues the commanding officer, the entire unit surrenders to the lone Micky, who then takes advantage of this to commandeer the tank and blows up the broken down vending machine.In each one segment, the Monkees try to deal with the fact that they're four real people in a real band that makes records for real people, but are also scripted characters in a fake TV band doing nothing except exactly what the director wants them to.They continually try to prove to themselves that they're free and can make any choice they want. But no matter what they try deliberately flubbing their lines in scenes from their TV show, pointing out to other characters that they're really just actors making a movie, complaining to producers Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson... who are on the set but not part of the film, smashing through the painted paper walls, walking off the set and into the street, physically attacking other actors for no reason, and making everyone they encounter mad at them they discover that their every word and deed was predetermined to the finest detail by the script of the movie they're in and the director directing it.For example, they forget their worries at a party where girls are go-go dancing. But a mirror on the wall reveals the movie camera shooting directly into it, recording the scene we are watching while Rafelson sits next to the camera in the mirror.At one point, Peter actually discovers the answer to the free will contradiction in their reality. The four frequently find themselves inside a large black box from which they cannot escape. The box represents the constraints of being fictional characters unable to make any real choices. Peter announces that he will talk about the nature of conceptual reality, then informs the others that ""it doesn't matter if we're in the box"". He realizes that the difference between free will and pre-scripted action is illusory. As long as you can do anything you want, 'it doesn't matter' if your choices were known in advance by some powerful entity in a higher level of context outside the universe, because the situation in which you find yourself is identical to one in which there is no outer context and you really are free.Unfortunately, the other three pay no attention to Pete's liberating revelation, which they characterize as navel-contemplating nonsense, and soon, even Pete forgets about it.While being chased by everyone they've encountered (and disrupted) in the various vignettes, they run onto a bridge, shoving people out of the way. We see that they weren't being ""wacky"" at the beginning of the film; they were desperately trying to escape being mere scripted puppets. Finally, we see that they went to the bridge to make the ultimate assertion of free will. They jump off the edge and commit suicide, falling a very long way and slamming into the water far below.However in the final scene, we see that this, too, was scripted. The film's director hauls their soaked bodies away in a huge aquarium while the four stare blankly through the glass, struggling under the water.

The Night They Raided Minsky's,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063348/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A naive young Amish woman runs away from her home in Pennsylvania to New York City, where she hopes to act in religious stage plays but ends up performing in Burlesque theatre. Rachel arrives in New York from her Amish community intent on becoming a dancer. Unfortunately, Billy Minsky's Burlesque is hardly the place for her Dances From The Bible. But the show's comedian Raymond sees a way of wrong-footing the local do-gooders by announcing the new Paris sensation, ""Madame Fifi,"" and putting on Rachel's performance as the place is raided. All too complicated, the more so since her father is scouring the city for her and both Raymond and his straight-man Chick are falling for Rachel.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} In 1925, Rachel Schpitendavel, a young Amish girl, comes to New York City to dance. She ends up at Minsky's, a legendary burlesque house that prude Vance Fowler is trying to shut down. As she grows more accustomed to the ways and mores of city life, her family searches for her and a comedian falls for her.—Huggo Included throughout the film are various dances and routines actually used in the days of burlesque and they play as an important part in the movie as the actual plot itself.The story opens in 1925 with a young Amish girl, Rachel Schpitendavel (Britt Ekland) arriving in New York City. Rachel has dreamed of being a dancer from the time she was a little girl much to the displeasure of her strict, religious father, Jacob Schpitendavel (Harry Andrews). Rachel has run off to New York from her home in Pennsylvania to join the Minsky Burlesque show at the National Winter Garden Theater.Upon arriving at the theater she meets Professor Spats (Bert Lahr) a retired performer. He takes her into the theater to see the show. Rachel is excited about the dancing she sees, but seems clueless about most of the sexual innuendo in the performance. Spats promises her that after the show he will introduce her to the cast and Mr. Minsky.Bill Minsky (Elliott Gould), however, is having his own problems. Secretary for the Society for Decency, Vance Fowler (Denholm Elliott) is writing letters complaining about the show's skimpy costumes, suggestive dancing and bawdy humor. So far, Fowler has not convinced the police department to shutdown the show, but the letters have been disturbing to Louis Minsky (Joseph Wiseman), Bill's father. Louis owns the theater and leases it to Bill. He tells him he will not renew the lease when it expires next week. To continue the show Bill will have to buy the theater for $190,000. Bill tries to convince small time gangster and speakeasy owner Trim Houlihan (Forrest Tucker) to become partners with him and give him the money. Though Trim is a big fan of burlesque, he declines to invest.Word of the situation soon reaches the cast including the comedy team of funnyman Chick Williams (Norman Wisdom) and straight man Raymond Paine (Jason Robards). Chick is a decent, dependable, short guy who can't get a girl to take a second look at him, while Raymond is a handsome, untrustworthy womanizer that every girl adores. When Spats introduces Rachel to them, Chick is immediately taken with her while Raymond is unimpressed with her dancing specialty: interpreting stories from the Bible.After returning to his dressing room, however, Raymond gets an idea to save the show. He proposes putting Rachel into the midnight performance billed as ""Madam Fifi"" from Paris and start a rumor that she is will be doing a daring new erotic dance. This should be enough for Fowler to convince the police to raid the place. However, when the police and press appear and find only Rachel dancing her innocent Bible stories, Fowler will be discredited and cease to be a problem.Bill Minsky approves of the plan, though Chick is concerned that Rachel will be humiliated. The cast takes Rachel, their newest member, to lunch where she meets Trim Houlihan. It is clear he is interested in her, so to distract him Chick and Raymond instigate an argument between Trim and the restaurant owner. While they fight, Chick, Raymond and Rachel slip out and go to a shop where they arrange for Rachel's costume. By this time Raymond is starting to get interested in Rachel himself, and slips out of the shop with her while Chick is bargaining with the owner over a fake snake for Rachel's Garden of Eden dance.Raymond takes Rachel back to his hotel room, but they are interrupted before much happens by Chick at the door pretending to deliver steamship tickets. When Raymond opens the door Chick sprays him with the hotel's fire hose. At the next performance Raymond gets his revenge by roughing Chick up.When Raymond gets back to his dressing room Trim is waiting for him and makes it clear he is to leave Rachel alone as Trim wants her for himself. Raymond reluctantly agrees and Trim leaves. When Chick gets back to the room Raymond makes up with him promising he will lay off Rachel, which is not much of a sacrifice given the threat from Trim.Between performances, however, Raymond breaks his promises to both and gets Rachel back to his room. This time, however, they are interrupted by Rachel's father who has come to take her home. When Rachel refuses he tells her he will be on the 1AM train back to Pennsylvania and if she is not with him he will disown her. He then leaves. Rachel is upset at first, but then brightens telling Raymond she will have a new life with him and be happy working as a dancer at Minsky's. Raymond is taken aback knowing that the dancing is all a sham and she will be losing her family for nothing.Raymond convinces Rachel to take a nap before her performance and leaves her at his room and heads for the theater. There he instructs Spats to get Rachel onto the 1AM train. Inside the theater Billy Minsky is concerned as the theater is packed and interest in Fifi's performance is at a fever pitch. He knows that he will need more than Rachel's Bible dancing to satisfy the crowd and talks dancer Mae Harris (Gloria LeRoy) into putting on Rachel's French costume, though Mae is a bit perplexed about how she is to dance. Meanwhile Fowler and the police arrive to watch the show and see if the law is broken.In the middle of Chick and Raymond's performance Spats signals from off-stage and Raymond walks off leaving Chick to finish the act alone. Spats tell Raymond that Trim picked up Rachel and took her to his speakeasy with the idea of delivering her to the theater in time for her performance. Raymond immediately heads to the speakeasy to rescue Rachel. Chick follows and the two fight until Chick realizes that Raymond is genuinely concerned for Rachel. By this time Trim has appeared and they try to force him to let Rachel go, but even together they are no match for the brawny gangster and return to the theater bruised and without her.Trim does deliver Rachel to the theater in time and she is surprised to see Mae wearing her costume. At this point Billy Minisky confesses to her and Trim that the whole thing was a sham to embarrass Fowler. Rachel's father also arrives and when he sees her in a low-cut, sparkling evening gown Trim has given her, he calls her a whore. Something snaps in Rachel at this and when Fifi's cue is called she heads out on stage against the wishes of both Minsky and her father.Once she gets on stage she is at a loss about what to do, but tries some of the bumping and grinding moves shes seen the other girls dance. With the help of a sympathetic drummer giving her rolls and shots to her movements, she begins to improvise a routine. When she gets close to the wings, however, her father makes a grab for her and tears her dress along the leg. The crowd goes wild at this and Rachel tears the seam on the other side herself. With the crowd cheering her on she invents the art of striptease.Rachel unzips her dress and slides the straps off her shoulders so that it is only being held up by her hands. At this point she notices Raymond in the wings. Raymond, disgusted with himself for having turned the innocent Rachel into a stripper, has packed his suitcase and is leaving her and the show. Rachel calls his name and reaches out to him accidently letting the dress fall to the floor. She is clad only in her panties. At this Fowler signals the raid and Billy Minsky and Rachel are arrested. When Chick stands up for them, demanding to know why he hasn't been arrested, Fowler replies that Chick has not broken the law. Chick responds by squirting Fowler with seltzer and a general melee breaks out. It ends with the whole cast (with the exception of Raymond who has left) being arrested along with Rachel's father and Trim. As they emerge from the Theater to the press and the flash of cameras, we get the feeling they are considered more folk heros than criminals.Back in the theater the stage is littered with the remains of the show. Spats walks across the stage, picks up the seltzer bottle and puts it on a ladder, then leaves, turning out the lights. The credits roll."

This low budget first film from director Jean Rollin is in reality two very loosely-connected, surreally erotic shorts about vampirism. In the first, three Parisians including a psychoanalyst try to convince four neurotic sisters living in a decaying country chateau that their belief that they are 200 year old vampires is false. The alluring young women are influenced and controlled by a enigmatic disembodied voice which turns out to be the an aging, aristocratic lord of the manor, whose motives are unclear but clearly perverse. Local rustics unite to hunt down and kill the sanguine siblings. In the second, the Queen of the Vampires and her acolytes arrive on the scene, resurrect the dead, and promulgate the cause of the Undead while a medical researcher works to find an antidote to vampirism.—duke1029 Holed up in a decrepit old castle nestled deep in the French countryside, four troubled sisters are convinced they are centuries-old vampires. To help them dispel their senseless vampiric delusion, a Parisian psychiatrist and his companions set foot in the mansion, bent on finding a remedy. But the voice in the sisters' heads says otherwise. Now, as warm, thick blood starts flowing, the magnificent queen of the vampires emerges, demanding carnage and sacrifice. Nevertheless, revolt brews over. Is there a cure for vampirism?—Nick Riganas Three strangers--Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte--are coming to cure four sisters (for want of names, I shall call them Catherine, Nicole, Sylvie, and Marie) of their vampirism. Legend has it that vampire hunters ran a sword through Catherine's heart during the reign of Louis XV, and villagers raped Nicole and blinded Sylvie with a pitchfork. But they neglected to cut off their heads, and so the sisters survived. Today, they live on a manor, surrounded by crosses and protected from the villagers. Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte don't buy the legend. They think the sisters are simply humans who have been driven mad by years of persecution and villagers who think of them as monsters. Curing them will require only dispelling the sisters' belief that they are vampires. The first step is to burn all the crosses around the house. Catherine succumbs to Thomas' promise to cure her, but Marie feels that this is a betrayal and that Catherine must die to protect the other three. Catherine and Marie stage a sword fight, but it is Marie who gets stabbed. The next morning, Catherine goes off with Thomas to see if she can get over her fear of sunlight (she can't).With the crosses removed from around the house the sisters are free to roam. This causes fear among the villagers, and they gang up to search for and kill the sisters. When Nicole goes wandering in the village, the villagers get her. They also kill Brigitte, who happened to be standing nearby. The villagers then storm the manor. Sylvie is wounded. Thomas tells Catherine that he doesn't think she is a monster and asks for 'the kiss of the vampire.' Catherine obliges. When Thomas comes to, he has been turned into a vampire. So the legend was true! To escape the angry villagers, Catherine takes Thomas through a secret passage leading to the beach. Marc follows and, knowing that Thomas is now a vampire, he shoots both Thomas and Catherine, leaving their dead bodies on the beach.As the lord of the manor checks the dead bodies of Thomas and Catherine, he is surrounded by a group of vampires wearing long robes with hoods. They present him to the Queen of the vampires who, angry at the lord for failing to protect the sisters, kills him and licks his blood from her knife. ""Now we have to start all over again,"" she says. The Queen orders that the bodies of Thomas and Catherine be destroyed, but her subjects disobey her and leave them lying on the beach. Eventually, Thomas and Catherine awaken.Marie's body has been taken to a clinic where she awakens. The Queen orders her to find Sylvia and also to bring her the body of a woman who recently died a violent death (turns out to be Brigitte). Brigitte's body has been placed in a crypt. The blind Sylvie has opened Brigitte's coffin and is singing to her. A funeral wagon flanked by vampires makes its way to the cemetery. They take the body of Brigitte away and transfer it into an ambulance just as Marc arrives with an armload of flowers. When he discovers that Brigitte's body is missing, he first knocks out Sylvie and carries her body outside. Then he jumps into his car and pursues the ambulance. He catches up with it, jumps from his car into the ambulance, but the driver knocks him out and takes him back
to the clinic. As the vampires pass the cemetery, they find Sylvie sitting on the ground. She has had her eyes gouged out and apparently is insane, believing that she's about to be married. The vampires take her to the beach, strip her naked, and leave her to wander in the waves.Meanwhile, back at the clinic, Thomas and Catherine have somehow made it there. Dr Semski asks Thomas for his help. At first, Thomas refuses. The doctor's assistant/lover explains how the Queen turned them both into vampires and then forced them to work in the clinic so that she could carry out research on vampires. But Dr Semski has been working on an antidote. Thomas finally agrees to help. Unfortunately, the Queen has learned that the doctor's assistant has betrayed her. The Queen has the assistant brought to her, where she is stripped, tied up, and beaten with seaweed.Thomas and Dr Semski are now performing in autopsy on a vampire. They find a reduction of the stomach and small intestine and enlargement of the heart. The doctor decides to test out the antidote on the autopsy victim (who is still alive) but, before they can finish preparing it, they are attacked by two of the Queen's vampires. Thomas is tied up and left on the floor in the autopsy room. When the autopsied vampire wakes up, she cuts Thomas loose.Marc has gone home and gotten some sleep. When he wakes up, he finds Brigitte in his living room. He can't believe his eyes but knows that she must be a vampire. He and Brigitte go to the Queen's house/clinic where they find some of the subjects in a lab, hypnotized, being brainwashed by a tape made by the Queen while they are hooked up to large cylinders that are either draining their blood or feeding them (it's hard to tell). Marc shuts off the tape, and Brigitte dies in his arms.There is to be a wedding. The queen has chosen Dr Semski and his assistant to be united in ""the imminent triumph of the immortal race...the wedding of blood that will open the doors to the world."" The doctor and his assistant are nailed into a coffin together. As the Queen revels in her triumph, Dr Semski suddenly breaks out of the coffin, and Thomas and Catherine appear and start shooting the vampires. The Queen escapes into the research lab to take a drink from a canister of blood. Unfortunately for her, someone has poisoned the blood. She dies in agony. The doctor decides to try out the antidote on his assistant. It works! She is no longer a vampire but, as a human, she is also dead. An unfortunate side effect.Marie runs down to the beach to escape in a boat, but she is attacked by Sylvie. Thomas and Catherine enclose themselves in a tomb to await their true deaths. Marc is last seen carrying the dead Brigitte from the Queen's house while crying out, ""All the vampires are dead! Chere, chere, chere Cordelia."" [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]."

We come to know that Kamenev was Kiril's torturer years ago. Both recognized that they came to know each other well. Kamenev tells Lakota that he will be released, no questions answered, on condition that he will never say who freed him. Kiril wants to reject the offer, but he is told that the conditions had been accepted for him. Kamanev shows Kiril some news reports about China being about to invade Korea, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and other wheat-producing Asian nations because, in only three months, the Communist leader will not be able to feed his people and millions and millions of people will starve to death. American submarines armed with heavy and nuclear weaponry have already been deployed the area of the China Sea. David Telemond (Oskar Werner) appears and gives Kiril a Vatican passport. Kiril will be subject to diplomatic immunity until he leaves the USRR. They talk in the plane out to the Vatican, and tells him that he's written a book which the Vatican officially has considered heresy, and the next day he has to defend his last book. He also tells Kiril that he has a deadly disease, so it won't take long for him to die. George Faber (David Janssen) is the first journalist who interviews him.The present Pope (Sir John Gielgud) insists on making him a cardinal. Kiril says that he kept a steadfast faith, but that he has only worked as a priest for his fellow prisoners, so is not prepared for the position. The Pope insists so Kiril has not option but to obey.George himself has a complex personal life, with a very jealous wife, Dr Ruth Faber (Barbara Jefford), who wants him to get rid of his lover Chiara (Rosemary Dexter). A tense moment happens when the nosy Marchesa (Isa Miranda) tells Chiara to settle down and get married during a high-class party.Kiril tells David that he didn't see much conventional faith in his book. However, David insists in his views: he wants to remain a priest, and is trying to fulfill his last years alive with purpose. David answers to the court who is judging him. During the interrogatory, he stresses that the design of God includes evil acts, according to him. However, there is no verdict, as news arrives that the Pope has collapsed. George is the first who gives live the news that the Pope has died. Everybody wonders who the next Pope will be. The two most thought-of candidates, Cardinal Rinaldi (Vittorio De Sica) and Cardinal Leone (Leo McKern) do not deem themselves worthy of the position, as they are too old and a bit old-fashioned. They need new blood and new ideas for the 20th Century. After the burial of the Pope in three coffins, one inside another, all the cardinals of the church move behind locked doors until they have chosen a new pope.Kiril insists on taking David as his secretary, although it's David himself who points to the fact of the ongoing court -the decision will be taken as soon as the new Pope is elected- and he believes the verdict will be against him, but Kiril insists. They joke that the only sure thing is that the next pope would be Italian.A crowd starts gathering around Saint Peter's while all the rituals before the votation are completed: the locking of doors, the gathering of all the cardinals. Neither Leone nor Rinaldi are able to get enough votes to be elected. As the 6th vote -at two votes per day that means three days later- still shows no decisive solution, George and other people wonder how long it may take to elect someone. Even Kamenev watches George on the news. They wonder also what Cardinal will be elected, as the right person could help them to their own ends. Kamenev admits that the situation in China could blow the world out. His assistant laughs because he is asking magic to solve his problems. Kamenev says that he has run out of maths and facts.In one of the meetings between votes, Kiril says that Communism has become really conservative. Some cardinals are afraid of revolutions, and Kiril is the only one who admits violence as a means to certain ends and social justice. Questioned further, he admits that he stole bread in the Siberian camp to feed a fellow prisoner with a broken jaw, and he almost killed the guard who attacked that prisoner. When questioned how he would have felt if he had killed that guard, he says that he doesn't know, but insists that sometimes violence may be the only way out.When nighttime arrives and everybody goes to sleep, Kiril keeps on praying, tormented by his memories.The next day, after the 7th vote having been void as well, Cardinal Rinaldi (Vittorio de Sica) takes a privilege of church law to openly proclaim Kiril Lakota as his choice. Lakota, Rinaldi says, has preached and suffered imprisonment because of his faith, and he has the strength of personality to adapt the doctrine of the Catholic faith to modern times. Although Lakota is reluctant, other cardinals join in the proclamation, and Cardinals stand up and finally Lakota accepts.Gelasio (Arnodo Foà) has set out three robes, as is the custom, to accommodate the newly elected pope, whatever his size. David feels completely shocked when he, with all the rest of secretaries, sees Kiril as the new Pope. Kiril chooses his own name to carry, as it was the name of the first preacher who ""carried the Gospel"" into Ukraine.All the public falls silent when they see it's Kiril. Then, the public cheers, and Faber says that, with the world on the verge of a crisis, it's impossible to know what the possible ramifications may be in the future.INTERMISSION - ENTR'ACTEKiril wants to keep David close to him, although the rest of the cardinals disagree. Kiril thinks he's an honest man in spite of his wrong opinions. He also wants time to act and pray, changing things. Igor Bounin (Frank Finlay) comes to talk to him, with a gift from Kamenev, some sunflower seeds. Kamenev still thinks that Kiril could see the right word at the right place. Bounin, under other name, was one of the torturers of Kiril under his interrogation. Bounin, on behalf of Kamenev, says that in two months' time there will be war, and that the only solution is that Kiril speaks to China on behalf of the Western countries, and to the Western countries in behalf of China. Kiril dictates his answer: it's a risky thing to do and needs more time to think about it.Chiara meets George at the zoo. His wife has followed them there, and sees them together.Kiril wants to talk with Gelasio, who's always busy with housekeeping. Gelasio says that Rome inhabitants will make jokes about the foreign pope, but in time they will get used to it. Kiril has an idea and asks Gelasio to give him a black dress and beret like a normal priest. Kiril goes out to visit Rome, and sees a painter painting, the heavy traffic, people going out having fun, the poor noisy neighborhoods, where Dr Ruth Faber almost runs him over. She asks him to go the a chemist's nearby for some medicines. He goes, but hasn't got any money to pay. The pharmacist trusts him and gives him the medicines. The dying man and his family (Leopoldo Trieste) is a Jew, so he prays in the typical Hebrew way. Kiril and Ruth bade goodbye, and he says ""shalom"" to everybody. Kiril used to work with a rabbi in the Siberian camp. On their way out, they see a couple kissing and caressing. Ruth is only worried about his failing marriage. They talk. He tells him to find the love she used to feel. However, the Pope's security is awaiting outside, so they can't go have dinner.When Ruth arrives home, George is packing. All correspondents have been called to Paris. Meanwhile, the Cardinals advice Kiril to wait, but he doesn't want to delay. David has to answer the Cardinal's court. David seems to go dizzy when trying to answer. (He is actually fatally ill; he has an inoperable aneurysm in his brain.) David's concept of Christ is different. They ask David Telemond to put his beliefs in a clear statement. He says he also believes in the world. Kiril himself will tell David that the court has decided that his opinions are not to be divulged and are dangerous. David is completely frustrated, because he has been condemned to silence. Kiril orders him to get medical care and stay silent. David says that he hates and loves the church at the same time.Kiril dresses in civil clothes to meet with Peng (Burt Kwouk), the Chinese leader, and Kamenev. Kamenev says that Kiril cannot be too humble or too proud. Kiril says he'll try to make peace, and open the markets of surrounding countries for China. Peng asks for Kiril to risk something if he fails.Back in Rome, Kiril asks for David's help. Kiril says that he should have not accepted. Kiril prays and says that his only consolation is that he cannot be mistaken, no matter what folly he commits. David says that he has no grudge against Kiril, although he'll still hold his beliefs. As they pray, David suddenly collapses, clutching his head and screaming. His brain aneurysm has burst. He dies offscreen as the Pope picks him up and rushes him to the infirmary.Cardinal Leone, feeling guilty about the way he treated David, asks Kiril to hear his confession. Leone admits he was jealous of David because Kiril loved and trusted him. Kiril admits he kept Leone at a distance because Leone opposed him. Leone says that Kiril must act, but he shouldn't expect approval or understanding. All popes felt lonely when they had to make decisions. Leone says that it can't be avoided.George is the reporter on the coronation of Kiril. All cardinals oppose Kiril's idea. Kiril offers his abdicadtion. Leone immediately says no.Immediately after being crowned, Kiril pledges all the wealth of the church to pay for food for China's people."

The Killing of Sister George,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063185/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The life of a soap opera actress begins to unravel as she fears her character will be written out of the series. George lives with her lover, Childie and plays a cheerful district nurse in a BBC soap opera. However, her character is to be killed off, and George realises that the only other job she can get is the voice of a cow in a children's tv programme. Her life begins to fall apart as Childie has an affair with a predatory tv producer.—Paul Baker <bakerjp@unix.lancs.ac.uk> ""Sister George"" is a BBC soap opera character who is ""killed off"" due to low ratings. The aging actress who portrays Sister George is a lesbian living with a childish middle-aged woman named Childie, who works in a factory when not playing with her doll collection. Conflict arises between the two lovers when the hard-nosed BBC female program director, who told George of her canceled part, also steals Childie away. As consolation for losing both her job and her lover, George is offered the voice part of a puppet cow in a new animated cartoon series.—alfiehitchie For its time, The Killing of Sister George was a groundbreaking film - and one of the first films in history to be released with an 'X' rating in the United States - a fact which no doubt impacted its first-run boxoffice total.The film centers around the soon-to-be-ending television career of June Buckridge (Beryl Reed) - a staple of a long-running British soap opera based in a bucolic and idyllic English countryside town called 'Applehurst'. On that series, she plays a motor-scooter-riding jack-of-all-trades (nanny, health provider, sage, best friend) - a feisty yet lovable and omnipresent voice of reason in the small town.Fiercely protective of her career and her character, she is equally fierce and protective of her live-in lover, 'Alice' (or 'Childie' as she is 'affectionately' called by her lover) (Susannah York) - a much younger, more nubile, and therefore more unstable presence in her life. Outwardly a simpleton - but possessing enough cunning to know where her future prospects lie, Alice is kept on a short leash by her 'master' - a fact made clear in a near-bondage scene in which June punishes her for a perceived slight by forcing her to kneel on the floor and consume her used cigar butt. (In a classic psychological moment of role reversal, Childie suddenly goes from grimacing while chewing the cigar butt to pretending that the experience is a pleasurable one - mimicking orgasm as she chows down on the rancid tobacco leaves. Of course, this spoils the effect for June (or 'George' as she is affectionately called.Problems develop when a drunken George enters a taxi and molests 2 Catholic nuns. In response to complaints to her station by the local Archbishop, George is visited by Mrs. Croft (Corale Brown) - a tightly-wound and prissy woman who holds George's future in her hands. She informs George that her future is 'dependent' upon her contrition and apology to the nuns involved - as well as a general change in her attitude towards her coworkers and her director. Mrs. Croft also appears to hit it off with Childie, encouraging her to continue in her ambition to become a poet.George's problems continue as we learn that Childie is likely seeing other people on the side - one of them her supposedly young and virile boss - AND misleading George as to her relationship with a local female prostitute who lives across the street. Unable to get honest answers to her questions, George flies into frequent drunken rages - her behavior spilling over into her deportment at work. Frustrated, she is 'written out' of the series for 2 weeks in order to have time to consider her actions and reign in her behavior.Her world begins to crumble when she and Childie attend a party at a local lesbian bar - and Mrs. Croft is sent there to discuss her future on the series. When told that her days in Applehurst are numbered and that she is to die by being 'hit by a delivery truck', she snaps - turning her frustration on both Childie (whom she secretly checks up on behind her back) and her coworkers (whose performances she tries to sabotage on her last day of filming). Discovering that Childie has been lying to her repeatedly (her boss is NOT young and virile, but old and balding - AND she has been talking to Mrs. Croft behind George's back), George explodes at her closing cast party. She confronts Mrs. Croft and Childie both - driving them out of the celebration.Back at the apartment, Childie is persuaded to move out and to live with Mrs. Croft 'temporarily' while she decides her future direction in life. Subtly, slyly, Mrs. Croft maneuvers Childie to the bedroom - then to her bed - and seduces her. Caught by George, there is a final scene in which all parties vent their frustrations to the fullest. Left alone and unemployed, George can only wander among her acting props, desolate, and abandoned."

Double-Agent Alexander Eberlin (Laurence Harvey) is assigned by the British to hunt out a Russian spy, known to them as Krasnevin. Only Eberlin knows that Krasnevin is none other than himself.

It's the late nineteenth century Austria. The Emperor Franz-Joseph and his son, the Crown Prince, Archduke Rudolf, have never seen eye to eye. While the Emperor retains the traditions of the empire in the rapidly changing world keeping it a police state, Rudolf is liberal, wanting to see the people have a say in what happens in their lives. Rudolf even rejected the Emperor's choice of a Spanish wife for him, he instead choosing Belgian Stephanie as his wife, that marriage which he himself never saw and will never see as anything more than a political alliance, Stephanie who he considers a shrew. While Rudolf has almost an unhealthy infatuation with his mother, the Empress Elizabeth, she has largely been an absent figure from Vienna and thus his life.

The province is defended by the feared 3rd Foot and Mouth Regiment (The Devils in Skirts), who are said to not wear anything under their kilts. When Private Widdle (Charles Hawtrey) is found wearing underpants after an encounter with the warlord Bungdit Din (Bernard Bresslaw), chief of the warlike Burpa tribe, the Khasi of Khalabar (Kenneth Williams) plans to use this information to incite an anti-British rebellion. He aims to dispel the ""tough"" image of the Devils in Skirts by revealing that contrary to popular belief, they do indeed wear underpants under their kilts.A diplomatic operation ensues on the part of the British, who fail spectacularly to prove that the incident was an aberration. The Governor's wife Lady Joan Ruff-Diamond (Joan Sims), in the hope of luring the Khasi into bed with her, takes a photograph of an inspection in which many of the soldiers present are found wearing underpants, and takes it to him. With this hard evidence in hand, the Khasi would be able to muster a ferocious Afghan invasion force, storm the Khyber Pass and reclaim India from British rule; but Lady Ruff-Diamond insists that he sleep with her before she parts with the photograph. He delays on account of her non-attractiveness, eventually taking her away with him to Bungdit Din's palace.Meanwhile, the Khasi's daughter, Princess Jelhi (Angela Douglas), reveals to the British Captain Keene (Roy Castle), with whom she has fallen in love, that the Governor's wife has eloped with the Khasi, and a team is dispatched to return her and the photo to British hands. Disguised as Afghan generals, the British interlopers are brought into the palace and, at the Khasi's suggestion, are introduced to Bungdit Din's sultry concubines.
Whilst enjoying the women in the harem, they are unmasked amid a farcical orgy scene, imprisoned, and scheduled to be executed at sunset along with the Governor's wife. The Khasi's daughter aids their escape in disguise as dancing girls, but during the entertaining of the Afghan generals, the Khasi, contemptuous of an annoying fakir's performance, demands that he see the dancing girls instead.
After their disguises are seen through, the British and the Princess flee, but Lady Ruff-Diamond drops the photograph on leaving the palace through the gardens. The group returns to the Khyber Pass to find its guards massacred and their weapons comically mutilated, in a rare moment of (albeit tainted) poignancy. All attempts to hold off the advancing hordes fail miserably, and a hasty retreat is beaten to the Residency.The Governor, meanwhile, has been entertaining, in numerical order, the Khasi's fifty-one wives, each one of them wishing to ""right the wrong"" that his own wife and the Khasi himself have supposedly committed against him (though no such wrong took place), by offering themselves to the Governor. After a browbeating from his wife, Sir Sidney calls a crisis meeting regarding the invasion, in which he resolves to ""do nothing"". A black-tie dinner is arranged for that evening.Dinner takes place during a prolonged penultimate scene, with contrapuntal snippets of the Khasi's army demolishing the Residency's exterior, and the officers and ladies ignoring the devastation as they dine. Shells shaking the building and plaster falling into the soup do not interrupt dinner, even when the fakir's severed - but still talking - head is served, courtesy of the Khasi.
Only Brother Belcher fails to display a stiff upper lip, and panics like a normal person. Finally, at Captain Keene's suggestion, the gentlemen walk outside to be greeted by a bloody battle being waged in the courtyard. Still dressed in black tie, Sir Sidney orders the Regiment to form a line and lift their kilts, this time exposing their lack of underwear. The invading army is terrified, and retreats at once."
Secret Ceremony,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063571/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A penniless woman meets a strange girl who insists she is her long-lost mother, and becomes enmeshed in a web of deception, and perhaps madness. Leonora Grabowski (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) mourns the death by drowning years earlier of her daughter. She encounters a strange waif-like girl, Cenci Engelhard (Mia Farrow), who bears a strong resemblance to her lost child. Cenci is struck by the great resemblance of Leonora to her own mother, whose death the mentally unstable Cenci has been unable to accept or even acknowledge. The two women quickly develop a symbiotic relationship, moving in and out of the illusion that each is the lost loved one of the other. The complicating factor is the arrival of Albert (Robert Mitchum), Cenci's stepfather, whose incestuous attachment to her may well be the cause of her mind's unbalance. With Albert's arrival, no one in the strange trio is safe.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> Leonora Grabowski (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), and Cenci Engelhard (Mia Farrow), a twenty-two year old heiress now alone in the world, embark on a relationship of sorts following their chance meeting. That relationship stems from Cenci, who suffers from psychological issues, believing, due to a physical resemblance, that Leonora is really her mother, Margaret Engelhard, who recently passed away. Learning why Cenci has this attachment to her, Leonora senses an opportunity to get out of her low rent life by realizing Cenci's delusion in becoming her mother, at least in her eyes. But Leonora also takes on this persona in her own unrealized motherly instinct, as her own daughter, Judith Grabowski, passed away five years ago at the age of ten in an accidental drowning. Reality could threaten this new arrangement, that reality in the form of Cenci's paternal spinster aunts, Hannah (Peggy Ashcroft) and Hilda (Pamela Brown), who, if they can't inherit the Engelhard estate, plan to steal it one item at a time, and in the form of Margaret's second husband, Albert (Robert Mitchum), who returns from abroad where he was living and who not only has that opportunistic sense like the rest of them, but also a predatory nature specifically when it comes to Cenci. What happens is also affected by Leonora coming to a better understanding of Cenci's psychological and emotional issues, and she doing whatever required to protect her ""daughter"" at whatever cost in not wanting to lose another child all over again.—Huggo While riding on a bus in London, Leonora (Elizabeth Taylor), a fading prostitute, discovers that she is being stared at by Cenci (Mia Farrow), a sad-faced younger woman who bears a remarkable resemblance to Leonora's recently deceased daughter. Cenci follows Leonora to her daughter's grave and invites her to the shuttered old mansion where she lives. There, Leonora learns that she closely resembles Cenci's dead mother. Touched by Cenci's need for love and intrigued by the luxury surrounding her, Leonora succumbs to the young girl's wish that she stay on and live with her as her mother.Explaining to Cenci's two greedy aunts, Hilda (Pamela Brown) and Hannah (Peggy Ashcrof), that she is the dead mother's sister, Leonora assumes her role with ease, settles down to a life of comfort, and becomes devoted to the child-like Cenci with them sharing a bed, bathing together, and doing everything together in a faux mother-daughter like relationship. Eventually, however, Leonora learns that Cenci is really 22-years-old, that her stepfather, Albert (Robert Mitchum), was banished from the house for attempting to seduce her, and that her mother was hopelessly insane.Returning to the mansion one day, Leonora finds Cenci cowering under a table after a visit from Albert. Cenci convinces Leonora that she has been raped by her stepfather, and the two leave for the seashore. Albert follows and confronts Leonora with the fact that Cenci is a sexual psychotic who has repeatedly tried to seduce him. Realizing the truth of his statement, which is supported by Cenci's infantile attempt to appear pregnant by stuffing her dress with a doll, Leonora desperately tries to force Cenci to face reality. Instead, Cenci seeks out Albert on the beach, consummates her love for him, and sends Leonora away.A short time later, Leonora visits Cenci, asks to be forgiven, and pleads for the chance to resume their former mother-daughter relationship. But Cenci sends her away once more and then commits suicide. When Leonora and Albert meet in silence at Cenci's funeral, Leonora suddenly pulls out a knife and plunges it into Albert, killing him."

Moe's live-in mother wishes her son would be a successful Jewish doctor like his big brother.—alfiehitchie New York City, 1968: A priest walks briskly up the sidewalk, whistling an odd little tune. He turns in at the entrance of a comfortable old apartment building, and heads up the stairs. Kate Palmer (Lee Remick) is coming down the stairs. ""Top of the morning to you, young lady,"" he says, in a lilting Irish accent, and she replies, ""Hello, Father,"" as they pass each other. The priest stops in front of Apartment 2B, and knocks. Alma Mulloy (Martine Bartlett) answers, a plump, middle-aged lady in a house dress and hair curlers. The priest introduces himself as Father McDowell, and she lets him in. After exchanging a few pleasantries, she tells him apologetically that if he's there about the church, she's no longer a Catholic...she lost her faith after her husband died. He acknowledges that most of us suffer in this vale of tears, and launches into a rambling discourse about his sainted mother, and what a beautiful, voluptuous woman she was. ""But she had a delicate spot on her body,"" he says, ""just there,"" and he touches Mrs. Mulloy on the ribs, and she giggles and squirms. He touches the spot again, and again she giggles and squirms. He swiftly moves around in back of the chair where she's sitting, and begins tickling her vigorously with both hands, until she is screaming and writhing with laughter. Suddenly his hands close around her throat, and he laughs like a hyena while he strangles the life out of her. When he is done, he kisses her on the forehead, and murmurs softly, ""So, now, Mama, you rest in peace."" He drags her body into the bathroom and seats her on the toilet. He finds a tube of lipstick and carefully paints a set of full, red, ""Cupid's Bow"" lips on her forehead. He stands in the doorway of the bathroom for a last look at his handiwork, blows poor Mrs. Mulloy a kiss and leaves.Morris Brummel (George Segal) is getting dressed in the apartment he shares with his mother. Mrs. Brummel is nagging him about his eating habits, his appearance, his profession (cop). She compares him to his older brother: married, three children, a doctor, making a thousand dollars a day...and all she gets from Morris is heartbreak. Morris, clearly accustomed to this, offers only token resistance. The phone rings, and he answers: his boss, Lieutenant Dawson (David Doyle), is calling to tell him that one of the other detectives has fallen ill, and Morris has been assigned to the Mulloy homicide in his place.Christopher Gill (Rod Steiger) comes downstairs to breakfast, a well-to-do, middle-aged bachelor, living a quiet, orderly life. Nevertheless, we see he is the man who strangled Mrs. Mulloy the previous day. He sits down at his dining room table, and his quiet, efficient housekeeper, Mrs. Fitts (Irene Daily), brings him his morning newspaper. He finds what he's looking for near the end of the second section, but it doesn't make him happy. He calls the newspaper to complain about the placement and brevity of the paragraph announcing the murder of Mrs. Mulloy. An assistant editor replies that it was probably due to the fact that they were racing a deadline. ""May I ask who's calling?"" he says. Gill hangs up. ""No, you may not,"" he mutters.Morris arrives at Mrs. Mulloy's apartment, swarming with police, technicians and reporters. He finds the super and asks which tenant saw the priest at Mrs. Mulloy's door. He replies, ""3E, directly above."" As they head upstairs, a reporter asks Morris if he can get a quote. Morris tells him no, unless he wants to print that the murder was well-planned and well-executed.Kate is slow to answer the door, and she is still half asleep...but undeniably lovely. Morris asks if she can describe the priest. ""If you've seen one, you've seen them all,"" she replies. He asks if he had any distinguishing features. ""You mean, like a big nose? I can't remember. But you've got kind of a sweet-looking nose, there, yourself,"" she adds flirtatiously. Then she realizes that she's barely dressed in a rather revealing nightgown. She tells him she's going back to bed, and he should come back later. ""I meant that about your nose,"" she says, with a little smile, as she stretches out on her bed. Morris leaves, but pauses in the hall just outside her door...to feel his nose.Later in the day, after Mrs. Brummel has seen the papers, she calls Morris: ""I am sick at my heart when my own son goes looking at dead women's naked bodies. I tell you, Morris, it is no way to treat a lady.""Mrs. Himmel (Ruth White), a plump, middle-aged German lady, has just fixed a tray for herself and settled down in front of her TV, when there's a knock at her door. She answers, and a gray-haired German plumber (Gill) tells her apologetically, ""I have to pound on your water pipes."" ""Oh, no,"" says Mrs. Himmel, ""Not on MY pipes...you go somewhere else."" She starts to shut the door, but he interrupts, ""What do you mean, go somewhere else? That's the trouble with the world. No one has any sympathy for anyone else, anymore. Well, I'll tell you something, it was a sad day when I left Frankfurt."" He turns to leave. ""Frankfurt!"" Mrs. Himmel exclaims, ""I'm from Frankfurt, too!"" ""Well, it's a small world,"" says the plumber, and turns back, smiling. ""I'm sorry I yelled at you,"" she says, contritely, and lets him in. He heads for the kitchen, but stops when he sees the cake on her tray. ""Baumkuchen!"" he exclaims, ""I haven't had baumkuchen since I left Frankfurt!"" ""Have a piece,"" she says, kindly. She asks if he'd like to look at some old photos of Frankfurt. He directs her to sit on the couch, so he can stand behind her and look over her shoulder. ""Look, look, look!"" he exclaims, pointing, ""There's my friend, Fritz, right there...he's waving to you..."" Mrs. Himmel looks closer, confused. ""He's saying, 'Goodbye, Mrs. Himmel...auf wiedersehen'."" He kisses her on the cheek. And in the next scene, poor Mrs. Himmel is seated on the toilet in her bathroom, with ""Cupid's Bow"" lips painted on her forehead. The plumber surveys his handiwork from the doorway.Morris is in the squad room, looking through fingerprint reports. Another detective, Monaghan (Val Bisoglio) asks what he's still doing here...it's past 10 p.m....asks why he doesn't get married. ""You sound like my mother,"" says Morris. The phone rings and he answers. Gill introduces himself as Hans Schultz. ""At least, that's who I am today,"" he says, ""but last week I was Father Kevin McDowell."" ""What do you want?"" asks Morris impatiently. ""I just want to tell you,"" says Gill, slowly, ""that I'm in Mrs. Himmel's apartment, and she is...quite dead."" Momentarily stunned, Morris recovers quickly. He attracts Monaghan's attention, who quietly picks up his own phone and requests a trace. Morris sets out to keep Gill talking as long as he can. But Gill, lying on Mrs. Himmel's bed and enjoying himself immensely, lets Morris know that he's familiar with call tracing, and knows just how long he can stay on the line before they locate him. He tells Morris that he liked the quote in the newspaper, about Mrs. Mulloy's murder being well-planned and well-executed. He gives Morris Mrs. Himmel's address, so he can come and see that her murder is well up to his previous standard...""And I want you to put that in the newspaper,"" he adds. ""In fact, I insist on it."" And he hangs up.The police, the technicians, and the reporters all swarm over to Mrs. Himmel's apartment. Morris looks at Mrs. Himmel, and turns away, disgusted and discouraged.Next day, Gill is seated at his dining room table, humming his tune. Mrs. Fitts brings in his daily newspaper. This time, what he's looking for is splashed all over the second page, and he smiles as he reads it all.Kate Palmer has come to the precinct, to look at mug shots. Once again, she hasn't been much help...""Some people remember faces,"" she says, ""with me, it's names."" Morris offers to take her home, and they catch a bus at a nearby stop. She asks if he's a good detective; he replies modestly that he thinks so. And she teases him, saying she doubts it, since he'd insisted on her coming in even though she'd told him she wouldn't be any help. ""You know what I think?"" she says, impudently, ""I think you just wanted to see me again."" Morris starts to protest...she laughs and accuses him of fibbing. ""Well,"" he finally admits, ""I might have fibbed a little."" They both smile. She looks around, and tells him this is their stop. They get off the bus, and as it pulls away, the camera shifts to the back of the bus, and we see that Gill is there, watching them through the rear window...in another disguise...on his way to another victim.The camera cuts back to Morris and Kate, walking along the street. ""Why did you move?"" he asks. ""The ghost of Mrs. Mulloy finally got to me,"" she says. She remarks on what a fancy name he has. ""What's your first name?"" she asks. ""Morris,"" he answers, sheepishly. She laughs...""I'll bet everyone calls you Moe"". ""They do,"" he admits, and they both laugh. They stop at the door of her apartment building, and he tells her goodbye. ""Was there something you wanted to ask?"" she prompts him. He hesitates, knowing he's not in this beautiful, elegant woman's league...then finally says, ""I guess not."" Then he blurts out, ""Oh, well...maybe I could call you...say, Saturday night?"" ""Don't bother,"" she replies, poker-faced. ""Huh?"" he says, a bit confused. ""Calling,"" she finishes with a smile. ""I'll be ready at eight."" He smiles, too, and walks on. She looks fondly after him, still chuckling over the name Moe Brummel.Gill walks up the hallway of another apartment building, dressed in a navy-blue jacket and yellow slacks, carrying a striped hat box. He pauses in front of a door and rings the bell. ""Miss Belle Poppie?"" he calls, in a lisping, effeminate voice. Inside the apartment, a middle-aged woman in a lace caftan (Barbara Baxley) gets up from her typewriter, and asks, ""Who is it?"" ""It's Dorian Smith, dear,"" he replies, ""I've brought your wig."" Miss Poppie is puzzled. Dorian assures her she won a contest after signing a coupon at the drugstore. She opens the door about six inches, keeping it on the chain, and asks, ""No strings?"" ""Absolutely none,"" he replies. ""All right, I'll take it,"" she says, holding out her hand. ""Oh, no,"" says Dorian. ""I have to fit it for you...otherwise you'll look absolutely dreadful."" She hesitates, but after making him promise he'll speak in a soft, low voice, so not to disturb her five cats, she lets him in. He directs her to sit on the couch, and takes a mirror off the wall so she can watch as he fits the wig. After some adjustment he asks, ""Now...what do you think of that?"" ""I don't like it,"" she says. ""Well, that's because I haven't finished,"" he tells her. ""It needs to be fitted in here, and tucked in here, by your neck...you do have a lovely neck, don't you..."" His facial expression hardens and his hands move into position...but just before they close on her throat the front door opens, and another middle-aged woman bustles into the room. ""It's only me, Belle,"" she says, ""and look what I brought for the babies!"" She produces a new, deluxe scratching post. Belle admires it, then introduces the woman as her sister, Sylvia (Doris Roberts). Belle tells Sylvia that she's won a wig, and Mr. Smith is here to fit it for her. ""Do you like it?"" she asks Sylvia. ""No,"" says Sylvia, bluntly. ""But I guess if you won it, you won it."" She looks at Dorian, and asks suspiciously, ""and you're absolutely sure it's free?"" He decides two Poppie sisters are more than he can handle. ""Of course,"" he replies. ""She gets the wig, and a custom fitting, and if she's still not happy with it, at the end of two months she'll get every penny of her money back."" The two women begin to protest, with Belle saying, ""That's dishonest!"" He shouts, ""Absolutely no one ever calls me dishonest!"" He gathers up the wigs and the hatbox and storms over to the door. Sylvia calls him a homo. He pauses with his hand on the door knob, says, ""Doesn't make you a bad person,"" and flounces out.Morris is at home, sitting at the table, reading crime scene reports and whistling softly. His mother brings in two plates, sets one down in front of him, and asks point blank, ""So, who is this girl you're thinking about?"" He tries to change the subject...asks if they didn't have kneidlach last night. ""Loss of appetite...that's the first sign,"" she declares. He asks her to just lay off for once, and she says, ""Temper...that's the second sign."" She asks if the girl is Jewish and Morris admits he doesn't know. Mrs. Brummel is distraught at the idea of Morris dating a shiksa! They are wrangling back and forth when the phone rings...Morris answers. It's Gill, using his Dorian voice...he's calling from a wall phone just outside his latest victim's bathroom. ""Oh, Morris,"" he says, ""I've been a bad boy, again."" At first Morris doesn't realize who he's talking to, and Gill blasts him for forgetting so soon. In his Dorian character, he is much more volatile, less controlled. He rambles about his brilliant characterizations, even giving Morris a sample of his ""uncanny"" W.C. Fields impersonation. Morris asks quietly if they can talk, one human being to another. ""Oh, no,"" says Gill, with a shaky little laugh. ""And I'm not going to tell you where I am this time, either...you'll have to figure it out for yourself."" And he hangs up.They find the latest victim's apartment. A technician finds a few strands of long, blonde hair that don't match the victim...asks if there was a wig found in any of her stuff. They tell him no. ""I don't know,"" complains Morris, ""how can you figure with a pervert like this?"" A lurking reporter asks Morris if he can quote him on that...Morris yells no, and has the uniformed officers escort him out.Back at the station, Morris calls Kate to cancel their date. The moment she hears his voice, she begins to talk excitedly about the dinner she's prepared...she watched that Julia Child woman, and has to admit it smells pretty great. Morris tells her, apologetically, that he can't make it, he has to work. Disappointed, annoyed, she says, ""Oh, well...okay. Just a small, crummy dinner. It probably tastes rotten, anyway."" ""Maybe I could come over later,"" he suggests. ""What for?"" she retorts. ""I don't know,"" he stammers, ""I thought...maybe..."" ""Morris,"" she says, with finality, ""I'm going to hang up now. Goodbye."" ""Goodbye,"" he murmurs, dejectedly. ""Morris?"" she says at the last moment, ""Tonight you be careful, all right?"" and then hangs up. Morris's face lights up...""Do you know what she said to me?"" he asks Monaghan. ""She said, 'Be careful.' Isn't that beautiful?""Gill is on his way to work, walking down the sidewalk with his briefcase, whistling his tune. He stops at a newsstand and buys a paper. He opens a wrought-iron gate, goes down the alley beyond, and enters the building...which turns out to be a theatre. He takes a private elevator to his office, takes the two wigs he was using as props out of his briefcase and puts them away. Then he opens his newspaper to read his latest notices...to be greeted by the headline, ""Killer is a Sexual Pervert.""Morris is at his desk, on the phone, with a tape recorder running and several detectives standing around listening. Gill is on the other end of the line, so angry he is almost in tears. ""You had no right to call me a pervert, and you had no right to bring my mother into the story!"" he screams as Hans Schultz. ""My mother and I were famously close! And we LOVED each other! I want a retraction!"" ""I can't do that,"" says Morris. ""I don't care,"" Gill screams, ""I want a retraction printed, or you will suffer the consequences! I am NOT a pervert...and you will NOT dishonor my mother!""Morris, Monaghan, and Lieutenant Dawson are in the office of Inspector Haines (Murray Hamilton), listening to the tape of this conversation. The inspector asks Morris if he called the Strangler a sexual pervert. ""Well, not for the record, sir,"" Morris replies. ""Our own expert on Freud,"" says the inspector, wearily. ""Brummel, I'm taking you off the case. In fact, I want you to stay home for a few days. You see, we can't print a retraction for your opinions, but maybe if we take you off the case, that will placate this madman."" He continues, telling them he wants additional safety measures taken, to include dispatching officers to hotels and apartment houses that cater to women. ""Tell them to stay inside,"" he says. ""Tell them to keep their doors locked.""A uniformed policeman, his back to the camera, is knocking on an apartment door. A middle-aged woman in a green suit and mustard-colored hat comes out of another door and walks by, glaring at him. A middle-aged lady in a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around her head opens the door, and is startled to see him. ""What have I done?"" she asks. ""You haven't done anything, ma'am,"" he says, in a familiar voice. ""Officer Brummel, 19th Precinct...I'm just giving out some precautionary information to women who live alone. May I come in and explain?"" ""Oh, yes, please do,"" she says, smiling, and steps to one side to let him in. The camera switches to the officer's face: it is Gill. ""Thank you, ma'am,"" he says, and walks in.Morris is at home, getting ready to go out, bantering back and forth with his mother. The phone rings, and Mrs. Brummel answers. Gill asks to speak with Morris, using a Cary Grant accent. ""Morris,"" Mrs. Brummel whispers, ""It's HIM!"" Morris takes the phone from her, and says ""Yeah?"" "" 'Ello, Morrie, 'ow are you?"" says Gill. ""Listen...I think it's terrible the way the police are treating you. You tell 'em I'm not going to talk to anyone else but you. You tell them to put you back on the case or I'm liable to be a very naughty boy again tonight."" ""Hey,"" says Morris, ""Don't do that, come on!"" ""I've got the simply sensational idea of guarding that woman what said she saw me dressed up in a police uniform,"" says Gill. He recites a bad limerick about Morris and the Strangler, then says ""Cheery-bye"" and hangs up.Morris hurries down to the precinct, and tries to sneak a look at the Strangler file. Monaghan catches him at it. He persuades Monaghan to tell him the new witness's name, in spite of the trouble it could cause both of them. ""Her name is Pearl Menzel,"" says Monaghan. ""You probably won't find her, though. I think she left town as soon as she talked to the newspapers. Or else she's boozing it up in some gin mill.""Morris arrives at one of the bars she is known to frequent, a rundown neighborhood dive, and asks the bartender (Val Avery) if he's seen Pearl Menzel. The bartender says no. ""Are you positive?"" asks Morris. ""As positive as I am that you're a cop,"" says the bartender, evenly. Morris decides no help is forthcoming from this quarter, and leaves. Shortly afterward, Sadie comes in: a tall, plump ""lady"" wearing a sleeveless black sheath, stiletto heels, a '60's bubble hairdo, and lots of make-up. She sits at the bar and orders a double Pink Lady in a suspiciously deep voice. While the bartender is getting it, she turns around and tells a bad joke as a come-on to a couple of guys sitting at a table. They rebuff her, and she turns to the man sitting next to her, and recites a bad limerick about the Strangler. A middle-aged woman at the end of the bar who's been sniffling into a handkerchief begins to cry, loudly. ""Knock it off,"" growls the bartender to Sadie. ""Can't you see she's scared to death?"" Sadie retorts, ""Well, who isn't?"" ""Yeah, but she says she actually saw him,"" says the bartender. ""Oh,"" says Sadie, chastened. She goes around the bar to the woman, to comfort her. She asks if the woman has anywhere to go. The woman sobs no. Sadie invites her to come home with her. ""I just live across the street,"" she says, ""He won't attack two of us together."" The woman hesitates. ""Come on,"" coaxes Sadie, ""We'll watch TV, have a few drinks...we'll have a ball."" The woman finally nods, and they walk out together, with Sadie supporting the smaller woman as she sobs into her handkerchief.Morris has been checking the bar next door...he sees the women come out and cross the street, and on a sudden hunch, he runs back down into the first bar, and asks the bartender who the hooker was. ""What hooker?"" asks the bartender, stolidly. ""The hooker that just left here!"" says Morris, exasperatedly. ""How would I know?"" retorts the bartender. Morris turns to a couple of apple-cheeked frat boys sitting at the bar, and says, ""Say, are you two familiar with the legal age for drinking in this state?"" ""All right, all right,"" says the bartender. ""She just moved into that brownstone across the street, basement apartment.""Sadie settles the woman on her couch, still quietly crying. ""You know what I think,"" Sadie says, ""I think you should call the cops. You need to get yourself some protection."" She lights a cigarette, and heads for the refrigerator. ""I can't,"" sobs the woman. ""Well, it's up to you and your own conscience,"" says Sadie, ""but just remember, he's killed four women."" ""Five,"" sobs the woman. ""Five?"" repeats Sadie, surprised. ""I didn't know it was five."" ""It is now,"" the other woman growls in a masculine voice. She sits up, and we see it's Gill.""Who was that woman with her...was it Pearl Menzel?"" Morris asks. ""No,"" says the bartender, ""THAT'S Pearl Menzel,"" and points to a woman in a green suit with a mustard-colored hat at the other end of the bar. ""Well, keep her here,"" says Morris, and runs out. He crosses the street, and runs down the stairs to Sadie's apartment. The door is open. He draws his gun and cautiously enters...the room is a wreck. He finds Sadie in the bathroom, sprawled on the toilet, a hasty ""Cupid's Bow"" smeared on her forehead. On the mirror above the sink, scrawled in red lipstick and underlined three times, are the words: ""Reinstate Morris"".They are back in Inspector Haines's office. ""I want all press releases on this latest murder to include the fact that Detective Brummel has been put in charge of the case again,"" he says. ""I'm doing this solely at the recommendation of our expert, Dr. Shaffer. But I want everyone here to know that I still consider Lieutenant Dawson to be in charge.""Gill walks into Sardi's. He is greeted cordially by the maître d, and shown to his usual table. His waiter asks what he would like, and Gill replies he'd like something French. And he asks for a telephone. ""May I 'ave Monsieur Brummel, s'il vous plait?"" he says, a la Maurice Chevalier. ""Maurice Dubois 'ere...'ow do you like my new accent? I am very 'appy that they...uh, 'ow you say...reinstate you. C'est bon, ca."" ""That's very good, very French."" says Morris. He is surrounded by detectives again, and Lieutenant Dawson, and the tape is running. ""How about a little more?"" ""Ah, no, no, no, mon ami,"" replies Gill, ""because if I take too much time you trace the call. I just called to say I start my vacation, and I promise not to be a bad boy. I give you my word of honor. A tout à l'heure."" ""Hold on...Can't you wait just a second?"" asks Morris. But Gill is gone.Kate is leading a tour at the Lincoln Center, where she works. She passes Morris, sitting on the edge of a planter box, without acknowledging him. He gets up and follows after the group. As she is talking about the Mark Chagall painting, he moves a little off to one side where only she can see him, and without any change in his expression, opens the right side of his suit jacket and shows her his gun in its holster...she starts to laugh, barely able to finish. She leads the tour group away, and Morris follows, apparently forgiven. They are both unaware that Gill is watching from across the plaza.They have lunch together, at an outdoor cafe. ""So,"" she says, ""you finally found out."" He asks, ""Found out what?"" She replies, ""That I'm the Strangler. How else can you spare me these few precious minutes? Oh, at first that was one of the things I liked about you, that you didn't try to make a pass at me right off. But don't you think you're carrying a good thing a little too far?"" He says nothing, still a little shy with this lovely woman. ""Morris, would it bother you if we stopped seeing each other?"" she asks. ""Yes, of course,"" he says, vehemently...but seems unable to say anything further. ""What do I do wrong?"" she asks, frustrated. ""Is a Jewish cop so wrong for me?"" ""The thing is,"" he says, and hesitates...""I want to show you my yacht."" ""Yacht?!"" she says in disbelief. ""My yacht,"" he replies, firmly.They are on a police launch, cruising around the harbor. They sit down in the stern, look at each other and smile. ""To tell you the truth, Morris, I've had him,"" says Kate. ""Had who?"" he asks. ""Randy Beautiful,"" she replies. ""And he was beautiful, old Randy...good future, good family...good everything. And then one day, I don't know...the message just came to me. I turned over and tapped him on the top of his beautiful head, and said, 'You only love me for my body, not for myself...for my mind.' And he screamed, 'What mind? Any thought of yours would die of loneliness.' So I got up, got dressed, packed my little suitcase, and I left Randy Beautiful...AND his good family, AND his good future. Tell me the truth, Morris...Do I have a good mind?"" Morris replies earnestly, ""You have a brilliant mind."" ""Are you tender, Morris?"" she asks, wistfully. ""You can have me if you say yes."" ""Yes,"" he says, firmly. ""Do you love me, Morris?"" she asks. He hesitates a moment, then replies, ""Yes, I think so."" She smiles and says, ""Kiss me, Morris"". He leans over and kisses her, a bit awkwardly because of the way they're sitting. They both stand and kiss again...and Morris IS tender...and they keep on kissing.Morris is sitting at his desk, alone in the squad room. A uniformed officer brings in Mr. Kupperman (Michael Dunn). He stands at Morris's desk and says, ""Ok, you got me."" ""For what?"" Morris asks, blankly. ""What do you think?!"" snaps Mr. Kupperman. ""You're the Strangler?"" Morris asks, incredulously. He can be forgiven his doubt...Mr. Kupperman is, after all, just under four feet tall. ""I killed them all,"" says Mr. Kupperman, smiling proudly. ""Mr. Kupperman..."" Morris begins. ""You be careful what you're going to say,"" interrupts Mr. Kupperman, ""I'm very sensitive on certain subjects."" Morris begins again...""Well, naturally, I wouldn't bring it up if it didn't have some bearing on the case, but...you're a midget. The few witnesses we have claim that he was of normal...uh...that is to say...he was taller than you."" ""You see how I fooled them,"" says Mr. Kupperman, eagerly. ""Did you talk to me several times on the phone?"" asks Morris. ""That's right,"" says Mr. Kupperman. Morris hands him the mike to the tape recorder on his desk, and says, ""Imitate Barry Fitzgerald."" Mr. Kupperman does so...very badly. Morris reaches for the mike, and Mr. Kupperman says, ""Wait...I can do W.C. Fields."" This effort is only slightly better. Morris takes the mike from him and says, ""Mr. Kupperman, I just don't believe you're the Strangler."" ""Bigot! You're a bigot!"" declares Mr. Kupperman, and the conversation deteriorates into a shouting match. Lieutenant Dawson's door opens: he pokes his head out, looks at them, nods slightly, and goes back inside. ""I'm very sorry, Mr. Kupperman,"" says Morris, quietly, ""but you're going to have to leave now."" ""You're turning me loose to murder again,"" says Mr. Kupperman, bitterly. ""All right, but this is what it's going to say in tomorrow's paper."" He grabs a piece of chalk off Morris's desk and writes ""6th Victim"" on one of the partitions. He throws the chalk at Morris and stamps out. Morris stares at the words for a moment, then he knocks on Lt. Dawson's door. ""I've got an idea,"" he says. ""It's kind of crazy, but it just might shake things up.""Gill is seated at his grand piano, playing a lovely, peaceful melody. Mrs. Fitts brings in a vase filled with flowers. He asks her if his airline tickets have arrived, and she says yes. He tells her that the flowers are lovely. ""Romance,"" he says, smiling a little as he plays...""Romance is the thing that makes men hold, and women bold, Mrs. Fitts."" ""If you read the papers, there isn't much love in them these days,"" she responds, stepping outside of her quiet, professional demeanor, for once. ""Riots, and wars...and all these murders. It's getting so I don't dare set foot outside anymore. Imagine, Mr. Gill, one man killing six women!"" ""What do you mean?"" says Gill, startled. ""Here,"" she says, and hands him his paper. The headline reads ""Sixth Victim"". ""Killed the same way as the others,"" she says, ""with the lipstick across the forehead and everything."" ""Yes,"" he says, slowly, preoccupied, ""yes. Uh, could I have my tea, now?"" ""Yes, of course...I'm sorry,"" she says, stepping back behind her mask, leaving him alone to contemplate this new development.He calls from a public phone booth. He tells Morris in his German accent that he didn't do it...he did NOT kill that woman. ""Say you believe me,"" he says. ""I can't say that, because I don't believe you,"" replies Morris. The detectives are standing around him, the tape is running. ""It's a copycat,"" insists Gill. ""I did everything up to now, and he comes along and wants to take credit, and it's not fair!"" Morris, enjoying the upper hand for once, replies, ""This is getting a little too weird for me, I think I'll hang up now."" ""Don't you hang up on me,"" hisses Gill, ""or I'll kill a hundred women...I promise you that."" He tries to calm down, so he can reason with Morris. ""A little commons sense will tell you that it's a copycat. Did he call you on the phone? Did he tell you where the body was?"" ""Neither did you the first and fourth time,"" counters Morris. ""But you forget,"" says Gill. ""I've given you my word of honor that I'll stop."" Morris murmurs, ""For all that's worth."" A uniformed officer enters the squad room and says, quietly, ""Pan Am Building, downtown."" The lieutenant and a couple of other detectives rush out. Gill continues to argue his innocence regarding the sixth victim...but Morris interrupts, saying, ""This time we got a full description of you. You're very short...you have blonde hair...a wide nose...bushy eyebrows."" Gill laughs, and says, ""That's very funny, you see, because first of all I have brown hair, brown eyes, and I'm approximately six feet tall, and..."" then, finally realizing, ""...and you are clever. Oh, Mr. Brummel, you are very, very clever."" He hangs up. ""But you're not quite clever enough,"" he adds, and leaves the building...swiftly, but not hastily. Uniformed officers arrive shortly afterward, and round up a few suspects. But when Morris, Monaghan and Lt. Dawson arrive, it's obvious they didn't get the one they wanted.Morris and Kate arrive in the hallway just outside Morris's apartment. ""Ok, I think I'm ready,"" says Kate. ""But tell me, Morris, do you love me?"" ""Yes,"" he replies. ""Madly, deeply? she asks. ""Madly, deeply,"" he confirms. ""Then I can move mountains,"" she says. He unlocks the door and they go inside. After introductions, Kate says to Mrs. Brummel, ""It's such a pleasure to finally meet you...and to see your lovely home. Morris, look at this,"" she says, gesturing, ""Isn't it wonderful? It's just so Jewish."" Mrs. Brummel is rather flummoxed by this comment, not sure it's a compliment. ""Jews always have the best apartments,"" explains Kate. ""The best taste, the best apartments...it follows."" ""Are you Jewish?"" asks Mrs. Brummel, brightening. ""I have been studying to be Jewish since I was 14 years old,"" says Kate, as they move into the living room and sit down. ""Off!"" Kate exclaims suddenly. ""What?"" says Mrs. Brummel, startled. ""Look at him,"" Kate gestures toward Morris. ""He has his foot up on your coffee table. Off!"" she orders, and he moves his foot. ""Lummox,"" she murmurs. ""Honestly, I don't know why I go out with him. On the money he makes we can't do anything. A Jewish cop, can you imagine anything so ridiculous?"" ""I keep telling him that!"" says Mrs. Brummel, amazed. ""Oh, but your son, Franklin,"" says Kate, with a smile. ""I wish I'd met him before it was too late. With a son like him, you don't mind having this one so much. But he is good for one thing,"" she adds. ""Morris, light my cigarette,"" she orders. He jumps to his feet, comes to stand in front of her, with his back to his mother. He gives her a faint, conspiratorial smile while he lights her cigarette. She smiles back, and blows him a secret little air-kiss. ""Now, go away,"" she says. He walks dejectedly into the kitchen. ""He's good for ordering around,"" says Kate to Mrs. Brummel, ""for yelling at and ordering around."" ""He is,"" agrees Mrs. Brummel, delighted. ""I can see we're the same person,"" says Kate. ""Yes, we are,"" agrees Mrs. Brummel. ""Would you excuse me a moment, please?"" ""Of course,"" says Kate. Mrs. Brummel slips into the kitchen and says to Morris, ""That girl is a gem...a GEM! And you know something else? She reminds me of me."" Kate breathes a long sigh of relief, and relaxes.Morris is waiting outside the lieutenant's office. Monaghan comes out, and Morris asks, ""Well?"" Monaghan replies, ""He says the chief doesn't like it, the inspector doesn't like it, and he doesn't like it."" Morris looks crestfallen. ""But the commissioner..."" continues Monaghan, and Morris looks up, hopeful... ""The commissioner says we've got a phony body, we might as well have a phony suspect."" Morris laughs and slaps Monaghan on the back. ""When?"" he asks. ""It'll be in the papers tomorrow,"" Monaghan replies. ""It better work this time."" ""It will, it will, you're such a worrier,"" replies Morris.Gill calls Morris again, from another public phone booth. He says in his German accent, ""Morris, I'm glad I caught you...I'm relieved because I read in the newspaper about this William Gibson of Tudor City, and now we know he had nothing to do with the first five, but that he's definitely responsible for the sixth, so, at last! You know, I think its important that we get the facts straight..."" Morris interrupts him to say, ""You can forget the whole thing. We're letting him go. The evidence we had on him only ties up to the last killing."" ""Yes, I know,"" says Gill, impatiently, ""but you can't let him go, and he goes out and copies me again."" ""I don't think so, Dorian,"" says Morris. ""As far as I'm concerned, you've still got six."" ""That's a lie!"" shouts Gill. ""Oh, you're losing your temper, Dorian,"" taunts Morris. Then he says, ""Oh, thank you, detective,"" to the air. ""Word reaches me that he's already been released."" ""Released?!"" says Gill, shocked. He hangs up. ""Released,"" he murmurs, clearly shaken. ""He hung up!"" says Morris to Monaghan, with mock surprise. They've shaken up the Strangler again...perhaps he'll make another mistake.Kate is at home, studying up on Jewish food, history and culture. A man arrives outside her door, with a large, elaborate food-keeper. He rings the doorbell; she goes to answer, checking through the peephole first. Poor Kate, with her memory for names, not faces, doesn't recognize Father McDowell standing there in a maître d uniform. She opens the door, keeping it on the chain, and says, ""Yes?"" ""Miss Kate Palmer?"" he asks, and when she affirms that she is, he says, ""I'm from the Italian restaurant around the corner, I was asked by Mr. Morris Brummel to bring this to you."" ""What is it?"" she asks. ""Well,"" he replies, ""I have some nice homemade spaghetti, and veal piccata with a little lemon juice, a salad, and spumoni, and café expresso...and last but not least, Valpolicella wine. Mr. Brummel sends it all with his love and regret that the lady has to eat alone."" ""Morris?"" she says, agreeably surprised. ""I'll be damned."" And she lets him in. He asks if he might use the table on the dais to serve her, and she agrees. He pulls out a chair for her, and she sits down. He puts his food-keeper down, and looks her over the way a wolf might look at a wandering lamb.Morris is at home, with reports and files from the case spread all over the table. Mrs. Brummel comes in with a tray and begins to clear them off, and they begin to wrangle over whether he will eat a meatloaf sandwich. The phone rings, Morris answers...it's Monaghan. He tells Morris that Gill called again. ""Why didn't he call me?"" asks Morris, puzzled. ""He left a number where you could call him, if you want to talk to him,"" says Monaghan, ""555-3810."" ""My God, that's Kate!"" says Morris, his face turning sick. ""I'll send a car,"" says Monaghan. ""No, no...subway's faster,"" says Morris, ""Get over there...go, go, go!"" He grabs his coat and tells Mrs. Brummel, ""Call Kate and tell her I'm on my way."" She starts to sputter and he shouts, ""Just CALL her!"" and leaves on the run.Gill is serving the nice dinner to Kate. The phone rings and she stands up. ""Don't answer it,"" orders Gill. ""It might be important,"" she says and goes to the phone. ""I said, don't answer it!"" he shouts, and in two leaps he's at the phone plug, and rips it from the wall. She stares at him in shock, as the truth dawns on her. ""Why me?"" she asks, softly. ""Why don't you ask him,"" he replies. She takes a step backward, and he takes two steps toward her...then they're both running...she for the door, and he after her. He catches her before she can get out, but she is able to get away from him twice. But the third time she goes back to the door, he finally gets a good grip on her, and clamps his hand over her nose and mouth. She slowly slides to the floor as she loses consciousness.Monaghan and the boys are at the outside door, ringing the buzzer frantically. The super admits them and they run to Kate's apartment. Gill comes out shortly after, wiping his hands, and walks hurriedly away. A policeman in a car spots him, and turns around to follow. Morris arrives at Kate's apartment. It looks very like the crime scenes of the other five victims, with officers, technicians, and reporters already on scene. He dashes to the bathroom...but she's not there. Monaghan comes out of another room, and beckons to him. He goes inside...Kate is lying on her bed, eyes closed, a damp cloth on her forehead. She opens her eyes and looks at him...she's all right, except for the Strangler's finger marks on her neck. He sits by her side, she caresses his face...he kisses her hand...and they embrace.Outside, Morris speaks with Monaghan and another detective, who reports that a man was seen and followed as far as 44th and Sixth. They have cars in the area looking for him. Morris and Monaghan go to join the manhunt. Gill knows the district well, and is able to stay ahead of them for a while. But he is seen going down the alley to his private entrance, and the officers converge on the theatre. They gain entry to the lobby, where they are calmly greeted by a man above suspicious: the theatre's well-known owner. They ask if he saw or heard anyone; he replies that, no, it's been very quiet. They ask if they can search the theatre. He consents, even offers to give them a little more light. They search the place from basement to roof, while he calmly watches. They return to the lobby, and admit they found nothing. He bids them good night. As they leave, Morris pauses in front of a large portrait of a middle-aged woman in period costume. It is one of several in the lobby, of the same woman in different period costumes. ""Rather a striking portrait of my mother, don't you think?"" asks Gill. ""Did you ever see her on stage?"" ""No,"" says Morris, ""I missed that."" ""You missed something,"" Gill says softly, with pride. He watches the officers leave, then glances back at the portrait of his mother. The camera zooms in on her full, red, ""Cupid's Bow"" lips.Gill is in his office, drinking a toast to his mother. He stands in front of a bust of her, and recites her speech from Antony and Cleopatra, rapturously, with closed eyes. When he finishes, he looks up to Morris watching him from the doorway. ""You surprise me,"" he says, ""I thought you and I were finished."" Morris replies, ""We haven't even started."" Gill tries to bluff his way through...but Morris has put the pieces together. He points out Gill's acess to a wardrobe department, and his penchant for accents. He taunts him about his mother, wonders what she really thought of him...and what she'd have thought of a freak that strangles women? He picks up a picture of Gill's mother from Gill's desk, and continues, ""They all had the lipstick, didn't they? The very shape of your dear mother's lips. The very lips on all those portraits out in your lobby!"" Morris asks for the key to the wardrobe department. ""I don't have to give it to you,"" says Gill. ""No,"" agrees Morris. ""we can come back for it."" ""I don't want YOU to come back,"" says Gill, petulantly. He goes to the cupboard where the keys are kept. He holds the key out, Morris takes it and leaves the office.Morris goes downstairs to the stage level and down another set of stairs that goes under the stage. Gill watches from a window in his office, then takes his elevator to the stage level. He turns off all the lights, leaving only an eerie red glow from the exit signs. Morris realizes his danger, and comes up from beneath the stage with his gun drawn. As he moves cautiously across the stage, he is almost crushed by a heavy scenery flat, then nearly beaned by a light frame released from above. He sees a figure running in the red glow, and fires his gun at it. He glances behind him, and turns back in time to get a sandbag counterweight in the face, which knocks him out cold. A spotlight comes up and focuses on the stage. Gill staggers into the light, staggering, holding his side, which is bloody. He nearly falls, grabs hold of the counterweight rope and eases himself down to the stage. He drags himself over to where Morris is lying, and grabs Morris's gun. He lies there for a moment, his head resting on Morris's stomach. ""Mr. Brummel, you're a better shot than I thought you were,"" he murmurs. He finally pulls himself up to a standing position, and looks out into the empty theatre. Hallucinating, he sees Mrs. Mulloy, there...and shouts at her in Father McDowell's voice. He also sees Mrs. Himmel, and addresses her in Hans Schultz's voice, punctuating his final soliliquy by firing shots into the air from Morris's gun. He slips on his own blood, and falls back on the stage. ""Oh, help!"" he murmurs...then in Dorian's voice he pleads, ""Sweet Jesus...save me."" He looks around for Morris, who has regained consciousness and is now standing among the empty audience seats, watching Gill, his expression impassive. ""Mr. Brummel, do me a favor,"" says Gill, ""Forgive me."" Morris's expression doesn't change...no forgiveness here. ""Puh-leeeeeeeze,"" begs Gill. Then he covers his face, and with a last, sobbing breath, dies. Monaghan and the other officers file back into the theatre and move up onto the stage. Morris turns and walks out of the theatre. In the lobby, he pauses between two of Gill's mother's portraits to look back into the theatre, at the last scene being played out on the stage. Then he goes out of the theatre altogether, onto the street, into the early morning light."

"Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell",1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062767/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Carla Campbell receives maintenance payment from three former soldiers who all believe themselves to be the father of her daughter, Gia. Twenty years after their initial war-time visit three U.S. servicemen hold a reunion at an Italian village. They all have fond memories, especially of local girl Carla. But she has been telling each of them that they are the father of her daughter Gia, so they have all been paying well for her upbringing. As this dawns on the threesome old rivalries surface, but times have changed and complications such as wives, middle-age, and the need to protect Gia's future start to surface.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} For twenty years, thirty-six year old Carla Campbell, who has lived her entire life in her hometown of San Forino, Italy, has kept a secret, namely that she doesn't know the exact identity of her now young adult daughter Gia Campbell's biological father, he one of three US Air Force servicemen she had relationships with over a ten day period when their squadron, the 293rd, was stationed in town when she was sixteen and recently orphaned: Lt. Justin Young, Cpl. Phil Newman, or Sgt. Walter Braddock. In not knowing and in wanting some respectability, she made up that Gia's father was another member of the squadron, her wealthy husband Capt. Eddie Campbell, who died shortly after leaving town: this information all a lie in there really being no such person as Eddie Campbell and thus she never having been married. As she found out about her pregnancy after the squadron was gone, Carla wrote to the three to tell them of her condition, each who has provided a support check to her every month for twenty years in each believing he the father, the name Eddie Campbell which each further believes is a euphemism for him. An unexpected consequence of this lie is that Carla has become a wealthy woman in receiving three times the money she ever needed, she owning a vineyard outside of town operated by her sometimes sexual partner Vittorio, the only other man ever to have been in her life, and having a full-time maid, Rosa, at her villa in town. Complications ensue when the squadron reconvenes for the first time in twenty years, back in San Forino to pay their gratitude to the town that showed them hospitality by dedicating a new chapel. Not only are the three men returning, but along with them their respective wives, and in Phil's case his three young sons. As each has some issue with his marriage, each longs not only to get reacquainted with Carla but to meet for the first time ""his"" daughter Gia, who is coming home from boarding school in Geneva specifically to meet the friends of her father so that she can learn more about him. Needing to keep the three men, their wives and Gia at bay from finding out the truth, Carla confides in both Rosa and Vittorio, who help her juggle the various meetings and stories.—Huggo Carla Campbell (Gina Lollobrigida), a young, attractive widow, goes back to her village after a short stay with her sister, who had suffered from a slight illness. There, he learns that some American soldiers who stayed in the town during IIWW will come back soon. Inexplicably, she gets frantic.Finally at home, she starts plotting so that her only daughter, Gia (Janet Margolin), who is expected to be returning home from her Swedish boarding school in a short time, stays at the boarding school for the summer. But it's too late, because Gia is already on her way home. Back home, Carla reads her mail. She disregards notices, bills and so on, focusing on three letters from the USA.Carla admits to her maid and friend Rosa (Naomi Stevens) what had really happened. When she was young, she felt lonely and sad, so she consolled herself with three different American soldiers - Phil Newman (Phil Silvers), Walter Braddock (Telly Savalas) and Justin Young (Peter Lawford), dedicating a week to each one and having one sexual relation with each of them. She never knew which one of them was the actual father of her child, so she decided to write to each one of them telling that Gia was his child. They have been sending Carla money to take care of Gia. Now, the three of them are going to visit Carla and want to meet Gia for the first time.Her plot to keep Gia away has failed. The three men arrive at Carla's with minutes of one another, but she succeeds in hiding each one from the rest although several funny situations happen. At the welcome-back dance, the three men see Gia for the first time. Gia and Justin have the time to talk to each other while dancing, but she still doesn't know that any of them is supposed to be her father. At that dance, Shirley Newman, (Shelley Winters), the talkative and good-hearted wife of Phil, decides to make an extra homage party dedicated to the late husband of Mrs Campbell, an alleged army lieutenant called Eddie Campbell, whom nobody seems to remember, but who nobody admits out loud not to remember.This makes Carla even more hysterical. At the same time, pressure heightens, as on top of it all, Gia tells her mother that she is in love with a married man, an architect who is moving to Brazil and has asked her to run away with him, because he doesn't want to get divorced. Carla says it'll be a great mistake on Gia's part, because she deserves a man of her own. Carla is afraid that that man will eventually get tired of Gia, leaving her as a prostitute in a faraway country. Vittorio (Phillipe Leroy), a man who drives Carla's van and takes care of her business, the renown wineries Carla Campbell, tries to help Carla. Carla and Vittorio have been in love for many years, but they have a kind of love-hate relationship, which doesn't allow them to settle down and marry one another.While Shirley believes all her husband's excuses, the two other wives, rude blonde, stripper-like Fritzie Braddock (Lee Grant) and snobbish Lauren Young (Marian McCargo-Moses) are not so gullible. The three of them and Carla meet at the hairdresser's, and they talk of having tea together at the Countess' castle. The Countess (Giovanna Galletti) has always disliked Carla, shunning her from the village's social life, although Carla is well-off because of the money she receives from the three men. The Countess is the only person who has always suspected that Carla is not the honest widow she pretends to be. Carla would prefer not to go to the tea party, but she is unable to refuse in the face of Shirley's insistence . At the same time, Carla expects the Countess to finally accept her as an equal lady. That is not to be, as in another fun scene the Countess gives signs for the musicians to play louder so that no one will hear Carla's speech.At that tea party, the three wives talk among themselves, while outside the three husbands are also talking among themselves. The three wives, looking for the truth, confront their husbands, and all six realize the deceit that Carla has played on the men, and that the men have played on their wives.Gia has also learnt everything: she saw all the money her mother has been receiving from the three men along the years, all written down in a book in the bank. That's the final push she needs to leave her rural life to live with her married architect. Gia and Carla have a big row, and Gia leaves. Gia is so excited and angry, that she has a car accident. She runs into a hospital, crashing the car into the hospital ward. (All the roads in the film are thin, curvy and made of cubblestone, which makes it very difficult to drive around.) Vittorio talks to Carla, and she leaves everything at once to assist her daughter. By the time she arrives, all three of Gina's possible fathers are talking with her as she packs to leave the hospital. The three fathers convince Gia that she needs to stay in school, not run away with a married man.At the end, Gia promises not to run to her married lover. The Newmans promise to treat Gia as their own daughter (they can't have any children of their own) and to pay all of Gia's university expenses at the USA, where she will study the following year. The Countess is furious, because she could not expose Carla openly, although it's understood that she will keep on excluding Carla from her flamboyant social life, and the special party and mass in honour of the late lieutenant Eddie Campbell goes smoothly. Carla will not receive money from any of the three men anymore, but after she has the opportunity to explain her reasons, each one of the fathers decides to let things be, and none sue Carla for the money she tricked them into paying.Carla and Vittorio had broken up -she had fired him, treating him unfairly-, only to re-start their love-hate relationship at the end of the film with another row, showing that, although Gia's life is going to change a lot, and none of the three men will ever return to the Italian village, Carla's life will go on as it used to - as it SHOULD be.--synopsis written by KrystelClaire"

Asterix and Cleopatra,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062687/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ordered by Cleopatra to build a palace in Alexandria within three months as part of a bet with Caesar, an architect enlists the help of Asterix, Obelix and Getafix. Popular animated hero Asterix and his faithful sidekick Obelix travel to ancient Egypt to help Cleopatra build a new summer home. Cleopatra and Julius Caesar have made a bet, with Caesar wagering the project cannot be completed in a few weeks time. With the help of a magic potion, Asterix comes to the rescue of the Queen of the Nile as Caesar and an angry architect plot against them.—Anonymous After a heated argument with Julius Caesar over his lack of faith in the Egyptian people, Queen Cleopatra enters into a bet claiming that she can have a magnificent palace constructed for him in Alexandria within three months. She gives this enormous task to her best architect Edifis (despite his shortcomings), informing him that he will be covered with gold if he succeeds or thrown to the crocodiles if he fails. Daunted and distraught, believing the task to be insurmountable without some sort of magic, Edifis travels to Gaul to seek help from the famous druid Getafix.Getafix agrees to return to Egypt with Edifis, while Asterix and Obelix insist on accompanying them. Obelix further insists that Dogmatix be allowed to join the voyage and smuggles him along despite objections from Asterix. En route to Egypt, Edifis' ship is met by a gang of pirates. Poetic justice rules the day as the pirate ship is boarded by Asterix and Obelix, who scuttle it after a largely one-sided fight. Upon reaching Egypt, it becomes clear that Edifis is not a particularly gifted architect; in Cleopatra's words his buildings are the laughing stock of those who don't live in them. His scheming rival Artifis proposes that they collaborate in order to build Caesar's palace on time and divide the reward between them; the catch being that Edifis alone be thrown to the crocodiles should they fail. Edifis refuses and Artifis swears vengeance, angered further by the injuries he sustains while negotiating Edifis' house (which later collapses altogether).Artifis raises tensions amongst the construction workers by convincing them that they are being exploited by Edifis and encourages them to strike. To win them over and enhance their productivity, Getafix gives the workers his magic potion which enables them to continue effortlessly with the construction of the palace. Getafix refuses to give any to Obelix, much to his disgruntlement. Building progress becomes so rapid that the labourers exhaust their supplies of stone; Artifis has bribed the supplier to dump the subsequent shipment into the Nile and the Gauls are forced to escort a fleet of ships to fetch more. Sightseeing en route, the trio visit the Pyramids at Giza. In his attempt to scale the Sphinx, Obelix provides an outlandish hypothesis as to how the monument came to be without a nose. The Gauls are intercepted by Artifis' sidekick Krukhut, who poses as a guide with the intention of getting the Gauls lost during a tour of the Great Pyramid. Trapped deep within the pyramid, Getafix gives Obelix his first taste of magic potion, presumably to give him the strength to break them out. The Gauls fail to negotiate the maze, but eventually escape after being heroically tracked by Dogmatix. Undeterred, Artifis and Krukhut make a further attempt to prevent the stone reaching its destination by hiring the same gang of pirates seen earlier in the film to attack the fleet on its return to Alexandria. A short second encounter with the pirates alleviates Obelix's boredom, despite their cowardly attempt at retreat. In a final effort to stop the three Gauls, Artifis frames them for an attempt to poison Cleopatra with the gift of a cake made from such ingredients as arsenic, strychnine and vitriol. Asterix, Obelix and Getafix are thrown into the dungeon after the Queen's taster becomes ill from eating the cake. Fortunately, Getafix carries an antidote that enables them to eat the remainder of the cake (giving the impression that it was in fact harmless) as well as curing the taster. The Gauls are pardoned and catch Artifis and Krukhut; their punishment is to work for Edifis as labourers.Cleopatra gloats over the likelihood of winning her bet to Caesar, who fears he will lose face with her should she get the better of him and instructs his spy to infiltrate the building site. Learning that the Gauls and their magic potion are involved, Caesar orders his three mercenaries to kidnap Getafix and imprison him. Two of the mercenaries are caught by Asterix and Obelix, who learn of what has happened to Getafix and promptly free him. In desperation, Caesar holds the construction site under siege and bombards the unfinished palace with boulders. Cleopatra intervenes, forcing Caesar to lift the siege and despite the damage, the palace is completed on schedule. Edifis is honoured and the Gauls are escorted home aboard Cleopatra's luxury ship, much to the displeasure of the sacred crocodiles."

Unknowingly, the cursed man has summoned two vampires instead, who have sinister plans of their own for the werewolf.—Humberto Amador Rudolph Weissmann [Manuel Manzaneque] and Countess Janice von Aarenberg [Dyanik Zurakowska]
are engaged, and their fathers are throwing a masked ball in their honor. They've been
friends and lovers since childhood but, when ""His Satanic Majesty""
Waldemar Daninksy [Paul Naschy] dances with her, Janice falls instantly in love. The
next day, when she stops at an antique shop to pick up a vase she ordered,
the shopowner formally introduces Janice and Waldemar. Shortly thereafter,
Janice runs into Waldemar again when she stops to bless herself with
holywater at church. Later, as Rudolph and Janice are driving, they stop
at the old, abandoned castle and, lo and behold, Waldemar is there, too,
""for the peace and solitude,"" he says.Waldemar explains to them the legend of the castle. It was built by
the Wolfsteins of Poland. Imre Wolfstein is said to have been bitten by a
werewolf and became a werewolf himself. A silver cross was driven through
his heart, and he was buried in the tomb in the castle. Legend has it that
a werewolf can only be killed by a silver bullet shot into his heart by
one who loves him. Therefore, Imre isn't really dead. Janice is intrigued
by the story, but Rudolph is peeved at Janice for talking to Daninsky, who
has a reputation for being an oddball.A storm is approaching. On his way back to town, Waldemar stops to
help two gypsies, Gyogyo [Gualberto Galban] and Nascha [Rosanna Yanni], push their wagon out of the mud. When
they ask if there is someplace nearby where they can take shelter from the
coming storm, Waldemar suggests the castle. After having a bit too much
wine, the gypsies explore the castle, coming upon the family crypt where
lay the tombs of the dead Wolfsteins. Thinking the dead may be buried with
jewels, they begin opening the tombs. A ring and a necklace later, they
come upon the tomb of Imre Wolfstein. When Nascha pulls the silver cross
from Imre's chest, Imre reawakens and tears them both apart.The next day, two villagers are found dead. It looks like they've
been torn up by wolves, so the rest of the villagers form a party to hunt
them down. During the hunt, Rudolph is attacked by Imre. When Waldemar
jumps in to help, he is bitten by the werewolf just as he plunges the
silver cross back into Imre's heart. Out of gratitude for Waldemar having
saved his life, Rudolph promises to shelter Waldemar and help find a cure
for his condition. Hoping to spare Janice from knowing about him, Waldemar
sends her a message to tell her that she must forget him, but Janice isn't
put off that easily. She follows Rudolph to the castle where she finds he
is keeping Waldemar locked behind bars. Rudolph and Waldemar explain
everything to her, and Janice agrees to help them. While rummaging through
the library, Janice finds a letter to Imre Wolfstein from Dr Janos
Mikhelov dated 1929. In the letter, the doctor intimates that he may have
discovered a cure. Rudolph suggests that they contact Mikhelov to see if
he can help.Dr Mikhelov has since passed away, but his son Janos [Julián Ugarte], who has taken
up his father's research, arrives at the train station, accompanied by his
wife Wandessa [Aurora de Alba]. However, instead of helping Waldemar, Mikelov and his wife,
who are vampires, cause Waldemar's body to become possessed by Satan, and
they hold him in chains while they feast on Rudolph and Janice, putting
them under their power, too. They even manage to pull the silver cross
from Imre's heart and bring him back to life, only to keep him chained up
next to Waldemar (although Waldemar kills Imre one night when they both
manage to break loose of their chains).Rudolph and Janice's fathers are becoming increasingly worried over
the strange behavior their children have lately been showing --
disobedience, wandering about at night, seemingly entranced, etc.. When
Rudolph leaves a letter with his father asking for help and Janice's dad
finds silver bullets in her bedroom, the dads decide they must take
action. They go to the castle, where they hear groaning coming from the
cellar. There, they find Waldemar in a cage and release him. When they
notice the red pentacle (the mark of the wolfman) on his chest, Waldemar
explains how he was bitten by the werewolf and advises them to load
Janice's silver bullets into their guns.Then they all go off to look for Janice, Rudolph, and the vampires.
When they come upon the vampires' coffins, Waldemar plunges a stake
through Wandessa's heart, thus releasing Rudolph from her bondage. Before
they can destroy Janos Mikelov, however, Waldemar begins to change into
his werewolf self. Janos escapes with Janice. When Waldemar's change is
complete, he catches up with them. Waldemar and Janos struggle as Janice,
Rudolph, and the dads watch. Janos is suddenly consumed by fire (that
springs up out of nowhere!), releasing Janice from his spell. As Waldemar
turns on the dads and Rudolph, Janice grabs the gun from her father and
shoots four silver bullets into Waldemar. She then rushes to Waldemar's
side as he turns back into his human form and dies. Rudolph leads her away.

Hot Spur,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063095/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A deranged stablehand kidnaps the wife of a ranch owner to avenge the rape of his sister. The movie starts with a pair of cowboys drinking whiskey in a small
cantina as a guitar player/owner plays music. The cowboys flirt with
the the waitress, but she blows them off. She can smell their attitude
and doesn't want to be there, but she is forced by the owner to dance
for them as guitar player begins to play again, a much less relaxed
tune. As she dances, the cowboys get all hot and bothered, and they
start grabbing and pawing the girl, with a clear goal in mind. Watching
it all is the Mexican busboy/gopher/whatever. As they start to rape the
waitress, he has flashbacks to when he was much younger and the boy was
forced to watch three or four men rape his older sister. He tries to
stop them, but is no more successful than he was with his sister. As
they start to get down to it, their boss, the ranch owner, comes in
breaks it up, and forces them to leave with him, their business
unfinished. The Mexican sees a unique ring on the rancher's hand, and
follows them out. The ranch owner and his hired help ride off to his
ranch. A little bit later, the Mexican, who has followed them, rides up
and asks for work, which they give him as a stableboy.The next day, the rancher's wife (Virginia Gordon) rides up and, after
some discussion, she goes into the ranch house. Later on, in the
evening, there is a little party going on with a three of local
prostitutes in the ranch hand's bunkroom. Some softcore sex goes on,
with some nudity, etc.Meanwhile, the Mexican sees the rancher go back into the house, and
sneaks over to peek in the window. The rancher has a confrontation with
his wife over her inability to produce a son for him. There is a lot of
anger and resentment back and forth, as she spits and slaps at him as
he insults her. To vent his frustration, he rips open her night dress.
The Mexican leaves them to their argument, and returns to his loft in
the barn, while the cowboys settle down for the evening. The Mexican
falls asleep, and has a fairly graphic nightmare about his sister's
rape. There are, littered throughout the movie, a fair number of scenes
taking place at different points in the rape, her top getting torn off,
her wrists tied in front of her as she is dragged/pulled over to a
tree, and hung up by her wrists barely able to stand. She was pawed
some more at this point by the rapists, and they tear off the remainder
of her clothes for the most part, before letting her down to the ground
and finishing the job.The rancher's wife goes out for a ride, and the Mexican, who has
apparently ripped off some supplies and guns from the ranch, captures
her, she tries to escape but she gets caught again, her clothes getting
partly torn in the process. He ties her up and then takes her off to a
cabin in the woods. He settles in, depositing her with her hands and
legs tied loose behind her, then goes out and sets various traps and
makes preparations for the inevitable posse to come looking. When he
gets back, he finds her attempting to free herself, so he hogties her.About this time the rancher realizes she's been gone too long, and
sends out his hands to find her. Eventually, the Mexican, who is
haunted by the ordeal his sister went through, combined with her angry
haranguing, attacks, strips her naked, and rapes her. After he's done,
he ties her with her hands above her head as his sister's rapists did
to her, and goes off to set more traps. One by one, a couple of the
hands find her and try to rescue her, but he gets the drop on them and
kills them, one of them stabbed in the back with a thrown knife as he
was attempting to release the rancher's wife. The two remaining hands
start shooting at the cabin, assuming that the rancher's wife is dead.
The Mexican starts whipping the rancher's wife to make her scream, so
they'll realize she's still alive. The two remaining hands stop
shooting at the cabin, which allows the Mexican to run out and get to a
rifle he'd smartly stashed outside the cabin, and shoots one of the
remaining two hands.The last one, deciding discretion is the better part of valor, starts
to run back to the horses, presumably to come back with more help.
Unfortunately for him, in a narrow defile he encounters one of the
traps, a bear trap, left by the Mexican, and his gun falls right at the
edge of his reach. The Mexican comes along, chases off the horses, and
apparently is going to leave him for dead, as he pleads for his life.The Mexican decides to show mercy, and relaxes the trap. For his
consideration, the hand, now able to reach his gun, shoots him in the
back, but, as he falls, the Mexican shoots and kills him. He stumbles
back to the cabin, bleeding from a wound in his shoulder.The loose horses return to the ranch, and the rancher now comes out
looking. At the cabin, where the Mexican has released the by now
exhausted wife, tells her why this has all happened to her. One of the
ones who raped his sister years ago was the rancher, who he recognized
by the ring he wore, which the Mexican saw in the cantina.Hearing the rancher approach, and, figuring he was going to die from
the bullet wound anyway, he runs out and faces the rancher outside the
cabin. Meanwhile, the wife, struggles with, and gets loose, the knife
that was in the back of the hand who tried to rescue her, and then goes
over and lies back down, back towards the door, concealing the knife.Outside, she hears a shootout occurring, but just lays there, waiting.
As the rancher comes in, her back is to him, and he reaches out to her,
she whirls around and stabs him in the gut with the knife. He is
surprised, and calls her name. She looks right at him and makes it
clear that she intended to stab him, and not the Mexican, by stabbing
him again. He dies on the spot, as she weakly, stumbling, stands up and
leaves the cabin, the only survivor of the whole nightmare."

While a plane is being hijacked, a report of a bomb on board, another report of a UFO in the area is cut short as the hijacker shoots the radio and the controls. This while they encounter a UFO, causing them to crash on an uncharted island in the middle of nowhere. They soon find out there is an assassin on board. Panic ensues when it is discovered that there is a UFO on the island, taking them one by one , changing them.—stephen scialli Air Japan flight JA307 is enroute from Tokyo's Haneda airport south
to Itami Airport in Osaka. As stewardess Kuzumi Asakura [Tomomi Sato] announces the
flight plan, which will take them over the island of Oshima and the city
of Suzuka, the pilot notices an unusual blood red color to the sky around
them. That's when the trouble starts.One by one, the passengers begin seeing bloody birds flapping their
wings against the windows as though in fear. The pilot [Hiroyuki Nishimoto] receives a radio
message to the fact that there may be a bomb aboard and is ordered to
return immediately to Haneda. Co-pilot Sugisaka [Teruo Yoshida] is ordered to check the
bags of each of the passengers, giving the excuse that a bag containing
confidential documents may have mistakenly been loaded on this flight. All
bags are clean and only one man [Hideo Ko] has no bag, but Kuzumi notices an
unaccompanied suitcase under a bench. Sugisaka opens it and finds not a
bomb but a rifle. The man without a suitcase suddenly pulls a gun on
Sugisaka and then orders the pilot to change course to Okinawa. To show
that he means business, he fires through the cabin a shot that knocks over
a transistor radio breaking the news that a UFO has just been spotted over
Japan and that Japanese and US Air Force fighters are in pursuit. Suddenly
a large luminous object is spotted directly in front of the airplane. It
passes overhead but knocks out the airplane's gauges, sparking a fire in
the engines. Air Japan flight JA307 goes down on what looks like an
uncharted desert isle.Sugisaka is the first to awaken but the pilot is dead as well as the
hijacker. Kuzumi is next to recover. Together, Sugisaka and Kuzumi check
for more survivors. There is Mrs Neal [Kathy Horan], an American Vietnam War widow;
Senator Mano [ Eizo Kitamura] of the Constitutional Democratic Party; weapons exporter Tokiyasu [Nobuo Kaneko] and his wife Noriko [Yuko Kusunoki], who flies into Mr Mano's arms when she finds
that she has survived the crash; Psychiatrist Momotake [Kazuo Kato]; space biologist
Professor Sagai [Masaya Takhashi]; and the young man who called in the bomb threat (whom
they lock in the cockpit). Taking stock of the airplane, they find that
they are out of water, have no food nor any idea of where they are. What's
worse is that a radio announcement says that a search has not uncovered
any trace of the downed airplane, so the search has been discontined.As Sugisaka worries about surviving, and Mano worries about his
upcoming election, and Tokiyasu worries about himself, and Sagai offers
scifi explanations, and Dr Momotake studies survival instincts clashing
with egos, the hijacker suddenly revives, grabs Kuzumi as a hostage, and
runs out into the night where they come upon a luminous spaceship. Kuzumi
crouches behind a rock, but the hijacker steps into a clearing to get a
better look. Suddenly, his face goes blank and he begins walking toward
the spaceship. A dark blob crawls along the ground towards the hijacker.
When she sees the hijacker's forehead split open from nose to hairline,
Kuzumi screams and passes out.Sugisaka finds Kizumi passed out behind the rock and carries her back
to the airplane. In order to get Kuzumi to tell what she saw, Dr Momotake
hypnotizes her. Kuzumi tells how the dark blob crawled into the hijacker's
skull through the split in his forehead. Tokiyasu doesn't believe her, but
Dr Momotake assures him that Kuzumi is telling the truth. Sagai points out
that it could be a flying saucer and backs up his suspicion with the fact
that reports of UFOs have increased ever since the bombing of Hiroshima,
giving extraterrestrials ample opportunity to invade the Earth while we
are preoccupied with senseless wars. While everyone bemoans the horrors of
war, the kid who called in the fake bomb threat goes berserk, not wanting
to believe Kuzumi's story. He attacks Dr Momotake, who falls off the
cliff. Waiting at the bottom is the hijacker. He latches on to Momotake,
bites his neck, and sucks out all his blood, turning Momotake a bright
shade of blue.A few hours pass as the survivors discuss the need to find water in
the morning. Suddenly, there comes a knock on the door. Mano and Tokiyasu
don't want to open it, but Sugisaka does anyway. As he descends the
stairs, he sees the hijacker lying on the ground and notices the big scar
on his forehead. Mrs Neal, whose husband was killed by a napalm blast to
the face, rushes to the hijacker and begs for the others to help him.
Against their better judgement, they carry the hijacker inside and dress
his wound.Mano is becoming extremely thirsty, thanks to the bottle of whiskey
that Tokiyasu gave him. Now, when Mano wants a drink of water from
Tokiyasu's canteen, Tokiyasu refuses. It seems that Mano and Tokiyasu have
been greasing each others' palms, Tokiyasu funding Mano's campaign and
Mano promising to pressure the committee to accept Tokiyasu's weapons bid,
a promise that Tokiyasu had no intention of keeping. In revenge, Tokiyasu
picks up a rifle and forces everyone out into the night then locks himself
in the safety of the airplane. But he forgot one person...the hijacker.Tokiyasu's screams can be heard outside the airplane. Suddenly, the
screams stop and the locked door swings open. Everyone rushes inside to
find Tokiyasu dead on the floor, all the blood drained from his body.
Noriko begins to laugh, exclaiming that she is now free from here
husband's abuse, but her laughter soon turns to tears when she thinks
about the way he died. When no one is looking, the hijacker comes out of
hiding and carries Noriko off to the spaceship. When the others notice
that Noriko is missing, they go in search of her.The sun is rising, and Noriko can be seen standing on a ridge. She
raises her hand to speak, but it is not her voice. It is the Gokemidoro
speaking through her. They have come to invade the earth, says the voice,
and to exterminate the human race. That said, the Gokemidoro have no more
need for Noriko's body, so she plunges off the cliff. By the time her
fellow passengers get to her broken body, she has disintegrated into a
shriveled old cadaver.Once again, the passengers get into an argument about whether or not
there are such things as extraterrestrials who would evade the earth.
Professor Sagai theorizes that the Gokemidoro have taken over the
hijacker's body and turned him into a vampire. Mano thinks that is
balderdash and challenges them to show him a vampire. Sagai agrees that he
would like to see one, too. The only way to do that is to sacrifice one of
them to the Goke. But who will it be? Mano suggests Mrs Neal, because a
foreigner will be less problems later. Mrs Neal screams that she doesn't
want to die. Sugisaka is against the entire idea. A knocking on the
cockpit door and a cry for water remind them of the kid who made the bomb
threat, so they let him out. Mrs Neal grabs a rifle and locks Sugisaka and
Kuzumi into the cockpit. Mano and Saiga shove the kid outside. Then they
line up in the windows to watch the hijacker slowly advance. The kid pulls
out the bomb he's been hiding and vows to blow up the plane unless they
let him back in. They don't, the hijacker continues to advance, and the
bomb goes off, killing the kid and blowing a large opening in the side of
the airplane.It's now evident that the plane can no longer provide cover, so
they'll have to get moving. But the bomb blast has wounded Professor
Sagai. Mano could care less and runs off. Mrs Neal follows him. When the
hijacker catches up with them, Mano pushes Mrs Neal towards the hijacker
in order to save himself. Mrs Neal shoots at the hijacker a number of
times but keeps missing. Finally, the hijacker grabs her, fastens his lips
to her neck, and sucks her dry.Back in the airplane, Sugisaka and Kuzumi are packing up supplies
while Sagai bemoans his loss of faith in humanity. As Sugisaka assures him
that they must believe in human goodness, they hear a shout outside. It is
Mano, and the hijacker is not far behind him. Sugisaka and Kuzumi go out
to help Mano, but he quickly runs inside the plane, locking the door
behind him. The hijacker turns on Sugisaka and Kuzumi. While Mano watches
from inside the plane, Sugisaka tosses a bucket of airplane fuel at the
hijacker, then sets him on fire.The Gokemidoro crawls out of the burning hijacker, creeps into the
airplane through the bomb hole, and makes its way into Professor Saiga's
forehead. Saiga drinks his fill on Mano, then turns to Sugisaka and
Kuzumi, who try to run. Saiga follows until they are stopped by a
landslide that knocks Saiga from the hill they are climbing. Sugisaka and
Kuzumi keep running, while Saiga makes his way back to the spaceship. Once
Saiga is there, the Gokemidoro crawls out of his skull, reducing Saiga to
a pile of dust.Sugisaka and Kuzumi keep running until they come out on a highway
where they see cars lined up at a tollbooth. Everyone in the cars is dead.
Everyone in the city is dead, too. The voice of the Gokemidoro can be
heard, giving the same message it spoke through Noriko...that they have
come to invade the earth and to exterminate the human race. Cut to footage
of mushroom clouds.Epilogue: Sugisaka and Kuzumi are wandering on rocky terrain. Sugisaka
wonders why this had to happen. Pan from the earth to outerspace where a
whole fleet of Gokemidoro spaceships are headed towards us. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Brides of Blood,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062758/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Natives of a tropical island have to contend with man-eating plants and animals, mutations caused by radioactivity. Virgin sacrifices become the norm. A small group of interlopers become caught up in the mayhem. The film opens with a freighter approaching a tropical island; on board, the captain of the boat has breakfast with his three passengers. Dr. Paul Henderson is a scientist who has come to the island to investigate the possibility of radiation due to the testing of atomic bombs in the area. Accompanying him is his beautiful wife, Carla, who seems to suffer from an extreme case of sexual frustration; she makes provocative statements intended to get a rise out of her stoic and seemingly emotionless husband. The third American on board is Jim Farrell, a Peace Corps representative who is traveling to the island to help the natives build facilities to better their lives. The captain tells his passengers that the island is rumored to be cursed, and is referred to by those in the vicinity as ""Blood Island"". The boat itself is the only one that makes a stop there, with the purpose of delivering supplies. There are only two stops per year, once every six
months.Upon disembarking, the trio immediately comes upon a funeral procession being conducted by the natives. They realize in horror that the two bodies being carried for burial at sea are completely dismembered; a dismembered arm falls out, causing Carla to scream in terror. After the ceremony, the Americans are greeted by Arcadio, the tribe's elder, and his granddaughter Alma. Carla immediately senses an attraction between the lovely Alma and the handsome Jim, and she very aggressively attempts to embarass everyone by remarking on it. Arcadio welcomes them to the island, but both he and Alma seem terrified of something, and he openly admits that he wishes he would have warned them to stay away before the boat left. When questioned about the deaths of the two women that were being buried, he claims the cause was an accident, but he makes the vague statement that his people are ""ashamed"" of returning to the ""old ways"".Paul goes for a walk around the island looking for specimens and is joined by Carla. Both of them notice a bizarre manifestation when the sun appears to set hours before it should do so. The darkening island becomes ominous, a feeling furthered when Paul discovers the carcass of an oversized crab. Alma acts as Jim's interpreter for the natives since she speaks English, but she remains secretive about what has everybody so noticeably on edge. Her anxiety worsens when Jim notices a strange plant near the village.The villagers participate in another odd ritual: a stylized lottery that selects two of the village maidens for some uncertain fate; whatever it is, it causes them to become very upset when they ""win"". The Americans are intercepted by a strange looking man named Goro; he announces that his master, Esteban Powers, has a table set for them at his home. Jim, Paul and Carla follow Goro through the jungle until they reach a stately hacienda staffed by a race of pygmies. On the way there, they encounter a banana tree with a strange arm-like growth protruding from it; the growth moves as if it wants to seize those who pass by it. Esteban Powers is a handsome young man who invites them all to stay with him instead of in the village. Jim declines due to the nature of his visit, but Carla insists that she and Paul stay in the mansion. Esteban seems to suffer from migraines, and he reveals that the natives were transplants to the island after the atomic bomb
was tested; while they are unaffected by any radiation, the flora and fauna of the island seem to have been changed. Paul mentions the land crab he found, and the banana tree. Powers seems to not be aware of these anomalies, although the group is startled to discover that he is actually 50 years old; his youth seems to have been somehow preserved.On their way back to the village, the three Americans are escorted once again through the jungle by Goro. This time, though, it is completely dark outside and the jungle is alive with strange plants. The banana trees have moving tentacles that sway when someone passes near; one of them grabs Carla and seems to want to kill her. Jim and Paul fight it off and move her along. Other plants behave ominously as well. Upon returning to the village, they are not comforted by the sight of the two village maidens being shackled to a remote altar and stripped of their clothing. The villagers leave them at the altar and return to their homes. Inside the hut with Arcadio and Alma, the Americans listen as a strange, overwhelming sound emerges from the jungle, a delirious breathing sound that echoes everywhere. Everyone is distracted when a large butterfly enters the hut and transforms into a fanged monster, biting Paul on the hand when he attempts to capture it. When the bizarre breathing sound grows closer, the girls at the altar start screaming. Arcadio and Alma warn the Americans not to leave the hut, despite the fact that Jim wants to rescue the maidens from whatever is out there.At the altar, we see what has terrified the captive women: a lumbering beast emerges from the jungle, humanoid but grossly misshapen. It approaches the nude women and embraces them in a bizarre appropriation of the sex act and then tears them limb from limb. The next morning, Alma tells Jim that the beast's appearance is what has driven her people back to their primitive ways, sacrificing village girls to the monster. She explains that the creature only wants women; the mutilations are its way of sexually satisfying itself. Her people believe that if they do not sacrifice their girls, the creature will destroy them all.Jim visits the hacienda and speaks to Paul, who has captured a cockroach that he claims has transformed into a monster. When Jim goes to examine the creature, Paul discovers that the roach has returned to normal. Carla verifies his claims, and Paul realizes that the creatures on the island have the ability to shift back and forth from normal to monstrosities. The villagers have another lottery and select two more maidens; this time, Alma is chosen as one of them. Jim is furious and attempts to intervene, but Arcadio and the other tribesmen subdue him by tying him up in a hut.At Esteban's, Carla unsuccessfuly tries to awaken Paul for some lovemaking. She sets out through the dark house and arrives at Esteban's bedroom, where she finds him writhing on the bed in slumber, covered only in a sheet. When she tries to get into bed with him, Goro suddenly appears and banishes her.The villagers await the arrival of the beast, and its strange sound becomes audible. Jim manages to escape his bonds and rescue Alma by firing a flare gun at the creature and frightening it off before it can kill her. The villagers, however, are now furious that their sacrifice has been spoiled, and they chase Jim and Alma into the jungle. They manage to dodge the monstrous vegetation and take refuge at Esteban's house. Esteban tells them that both he and his wife were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation during the bomb tests; while it seems to have left him with only migraines, it caused a disturbing change in his wife, who suffered seizures that eventually killed her. Late that night, Carla once again tries to seduce Esteban when she sees him stagger out of the house dressed only in his trousers. She follows him in the dark, unaware that he is the rampaging monster, the result of a hideous transformation that he undergoes during the worst of his migraine attacks. Cornered by the monstrous tree branches and carnivorous plants, Carla comes face to face with Esteban's deadly alter ego.Paul discovers Carla missing from their bedroom, and he awakens Jim. Alma hears the ruckus and joins them as they leave the house to search for Carla. Goro chases them with a machete and confronts them, killing Paul. Jim and Alma find Carla's dismembered remains being devoured by one of the carnivorous trees. They rush back to the village pursued by the monster. Jim manages to convince the villagers to fight back against it instead of trying to appease it with sacrifices; together they hurl spears and fire at it until they have it cornered in one of the grass huts; unfortunately it is the hut where Alma is hiding. Jim rushes in to save her as the hut goes up in flames, managing to get her out just in the nick of time. The monster is consumed in the fire, and the entire village watches as Esteban, human once more, stumbles from the hut and dies from his injuries.The village celebrates their freedom from the menace by holding a love ritual, presumably to encourage the tribe to reproduce and replace the people it lost to the monster. As the natives pair off and go into the jungle for lovemaking, Alma becomes enraptured by the music as well, selecting Jim as her mate. They slip into the jungle together."

She drives her car to a local garage where she trades it with a motorcycle and changes out of her sun dress into street clothes (includes blue jeans, a T-shirt and a leather jacket). She rides away over the opening credits. Karen re-joins her real friends that she has apparently kept secret from her mother; Karen is a member of an all-female motorcycle gang called the Maneaters. The Maneaters hang out in an abandoned house and hold weekly motorcycle races at an abandoned airport runway. The leader of the Maneaters, the tough-minded Queen, holds the races and the winner of each race gets first pick from the ""stud line"".The race begins and Karen is the winner, with Queen coming in second. Never the less, Queen is a good sport and allows Karen to pick first. On this particular day, Queen and the rest of the Maneaters return to their hideout where a group of young men have also arrived, whom are male groupies to the all-women gang. Karen picks out her usual ""stud"", a friendly guy named Bill... the same one she has picked for four weeks in a row. However, this is strictly forbidden among the Maneaters for according to their code, no Maneater is allowed to be attached to anyone or anything but the gang.Honey Pot, a teenage ""mascot"" and follower of the Maneaters who wants to join, reports to Queen her suspicions about Karen's attraction to Bill. After debating about it with her fellow members, Queen tells Honey Pot to inform Karen that she is to come to the runway that evening. When Karen shows up as expected, Queen and the rest of the gang angrily decrees to her a punishing ultimatum, Karen is to participate in the beating then dragging of Bill for face expulsion of the gang (which may also lead to her murder). Karen gets on her motorcycle and is forced to drag Bill, who is tied, beaten, and bruised behind her down the entire stretch of the runway and back. Bill is dead after this, and Karen's allegiance and loyalty to the gang is proven... for now. (Note: Karen looks completely revolted having been forced to kill a man she begins to feel attracted too.)Another evening later, after another get-together, Honey Pot is finally granted membership into the gang. In a hazing ritual, Honey Pot has her left hand cut open in a blood oath and made to kiss all the members of the gang to prove her sisterhood. Next, Honey Pot is stripped to her underwear and doused in honey and chocolate syrup and made to entertain the entire ""stud line"". Following this, Honey Pot is cleaned off, she is given a leather jacket with the Maneaters logo stamped on the back like the rest of the members and is formally initiated into the gang.The next day, the gang rides into the small Florida town of Medley and terrorizes and harasses the locals by riding their motorcycles through parking lots, through storefronts, and around the front and back lawns of houses. When their antics are stopped by the local police, the townspeople (out of fear of retaliation) refuse to press charges. As a result, the police make no successful arrests. Unable to pin anything on the Mateaters, the police are forced to let them go, only giving Queen and the rest of the Maneaters a warning to stay out of trouble.Another week later, the stud line competition is again on, and Queen and the rest of the Maneaters head off to the runway for another motorcycle race only to discover that an all-male gang are hanging out along the runway. What was supposed to be a fun-spirited race turns into an all-out brawl. Queen and the leader of the male gang, named Joe Boy, fight each other with knifes, which leads to a full fight between the sex-crazed nymphs and their macho rivals which ends with the Maneaters being victorious.Meanwhile, Ted, an old boyfriend of Karen's, manages to track her down and privately beseeches her to leave the Maneaters and return to normal life, either with or without him. Karen waivers, pleading the she is in too deep with the gang for any redemption and that he should forget about her. Refusing to give up on Karen, Ted infiltrates the ""stud line"" posing as one of the ruffians. After the race, where Queen emerges victorious, she gets first pick, but chooses another guy... unaware about Ted's identity, which Karen recognizes. Of course, Karen picks Ted and they go to chat in a nearby bedroom while an full-on orgy between the Maneaters and their guy followers happens in the main living room. Ted informs Karen that he heard through the grapevine that Joe Boy and his gang are out for blood after their humiliating beating by the Maneaters.Among all this, Honey Pot steps outside the building for some fresh air and is waylaid by the spineless male gang.

The bartender refuses to disclose any information about Joe Boy's whereabouts and he gets severely beaten by the angry gang leader. Queen customizes the bartender's face with her trademark bike chain belt.Two of the Maneaters, Whitey and Terry, spot Joe Boy and some of his gang at a local restaurant and report back to Queen, who arranges an ambush for him. Whitey and Terry return to the restaurant where they slash Joe Boy's tires of his car. When Joe Boy confronts them, Whitey sprays bug spray into Joe Boy's face and she and Terry take off on one motorcycle. Joe Boy takes Terry's motorcycle and gives chase.However, this is all part of Queen's plan as she, always on top of the situation, had told Whitey and Terry to initiate a confrontation that will engage Joe Boy in a pursuit. As planned, Joe Boy follows Whitey and Terry along a road where Queen, Karen, Supergirl, Ginger, Delta, and the rest of the Maneaters lay in wait. Queen and the gang string along the road a nearly invisible wire. Whitey and Terry stop short, but Joe Boy unwittingly forges ahead and is literally decapitated by the wire, and his severed head goes flying. Exalted, Queen drops her trademark belt beside Joe Boy's headless corpse.Afterwords, Ted approaches Karen one final time to persuade her to abandon the gang. Predictably, Karen again refuses and rides off with Queen and the rest of the Maneaters as they pack up from their hideout and ride out of town, leaving Ted alone and bewildered. Before riding out of Medley for any other town to hide out in and terrorize, Queen and the gang return to the scene of the crime to retrieve her chain belt that she left by Joe Boy's corpse only to find the town's entire police force there waiting for them. Threatened at gunpoint, Queen and all of the Maneaters are arrested for Joe Boy's murder.In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that with only circumstantial evidence and nothing concrete forces the police to release the Maneaters leader. Queen rejoins her gang waiting for her outside the town's jail and they all ride out of town for places unknown."

Before leaving, Vicky and Richard meet with Father Walter, an old friend to ask for money since Richard is broke. It is implied that Father Walter and Richard had a secret sexual tryst sometime back.In New England, Vicky's younger sister, Elizabeth, received a similar letter and tries to get her lazy husband, Donald, to listen about this turn of events.In New York, Veronica, the youngest sister of Vicky and Elizabeth, receives a letter from Dobbs and tells her emotionally distant and barren husband, William, about her sisters arriving for a visit.

Fortunately, Two-Headed Woman [Keiko Yukitomo] and Umbrella wander by and find them. Although they cannot free the Spooks, Two-Headed Woman and Umbrella do agree to relay a warning to Shinpachiro regarding Saheiji. However, they arrive just in time to see Ohdate/Daimon order that Shinpachiro be executed. Oh, what to do? Daimon is more powerful than the simple, peace-loving Yakai Spooks. Two-Headed Woman and Umbrella get Lady Chie to remove the ward from the jar so that the Spooks can be free to fight the demon, but Daimon replicates himself into a half dozen clones. Just as it looks like Daimon is going to win again, Umbrella leads in an army of Spooks from all over Japan. But there are too many Daimon clones.

Friends gather for the funeral of a friend. Sub-plots unfold as the group attempts to link-up to attend the funeral of their friend, Braverman.—<darmabum@li.net> Four Jewish intellectuals and writers are shocked to hear that their friend Leslie Braverman has died suddenly from a heart attack. They decide to carpool it in a crowded Volkswagon Beetle from Manhattan to Brooklyn to attend the funeral, but they become lost and their odyssey becomes a journey of self-discovery.—duke1029@aol.com Early one Sunday morning in New York, Morroe Rieff is shocked to learn that his friend Leslie Braverman, a fellow writer and intellectual, is dead. Morroe visits his friend's widow, Inez, and receives the second shock of the day when the supposedly bereaved widow tries to make love to him. Pulling himself together, Morroe prepares to attend the funeral services in Brooklyn with Braverman's three other close friends--Barnet Weiner, who gives up a Sunday in bed with his mistress Myra Mandelbaum; Felix Ottensteen, the oldest of the group; and Holly Levine, the most commercially successful writer of the quartet. Meeting in Greenwich Village, the four friends pile into Holly's Volkswagen, set out for the synagogue, and get lost. An accident with a Negro cab driver almost creates a brawl; but when it is discovered that the cabbie, like themselves, is Jewish, hard feelings mellow into streetcorner philosophizing and drinking. Eventually, the four friends reach the synagogue and dutifully sit through a marathon sermon before realizing they are attending the funeral services of a total stranger. Despite their exhaustion, they continue on until they locate Braverman's gravesite. When Morroe returns home that night and attempts to tell his wife about all the events of the day, he suddenly stops talking and begins to weep. In New York City, less than grieving Inez Braverman informs Morroe Rieff that her husband, writer Leslie Braverman, has died suddenly and unexpectedly at age forty-one. Morroe having contact with Inez has never sat well with Morroe's wife, Etta Rieff, in what Inez represents to Morroe in his life before their marriage, in Inez's openly flirtatious manner, and in Morroe always seeming to run to her beck and call. Rather than attend the Sunday funeral in Brooklyn with Inez as was his original thought, Morroe instead, at the last minute, contacts their somewhat mutual but not oft visited friends Barnet Weinstein, Felix Ottensteen, and Holly Levine - all Jewish, all facing some issue in their respective life, and all writers in some form or another in their own right - to carpool to the funeral together in Holly's compact VW Beetle, this plan despite, beyond the issue of the cramped quarters of the car, the four men living in the four different corners of Manhattan. The four men kvetch about their lives on their drive, only infrequently in relation to their friend Braverman, their talk affected by what happens along the way, with the trip itself potentially extended in Morroe only having a scant idea of where in Brooklyn the funeral and burial are being held. The situation has the added effect of Morroe daydreaming about his own mortality and what would be happening with those in his life if he was in Braverman's place, he watching the proceedings as a bystander in he taking on a different persona in each case.—Huggo"

The well-defended French coast has been dubbed the Iron Coast by the Germans. The British command is reluctant to give the green-light to this operation, code-named Operation Mad Dog, mainly because of the high chance of failure. The Canadian officer is known to have botched a few previous operations under his command. The main opponent of the Mad Dog operation is a Royal Navy captain whose son died during a failed commando raid led by Major Jamie Wilson. However, after much debate and haggling, the operation is approved by the R.N. Admiral in charge. The training of the commandos is harsh, under real battle conditions featuring live explosions and machine-gun fire. During the training, several accidents occur, resulting in a few deaths and wounds. The operation's future hangs into balance but it finally receives the go-ahead. Major Jamie Wilson is dismayed when he discovers that due to war-time shortages he will receive sub-standard equipment and an old mine-layer rather than a destroyer for transport to France. The plan itself calls for a ship laden with explosives to be rammed into the Nazi dry-dock. The explosives would be triggered by a timer, allowing the commandos on board to land and attack the shore installations, batteries and command posts. At the same time, a few small launches would land additional commandos along the neighboring piers to create a diversionary attack. The operation is in danger of failure when the task force is spotted off the French coast by a German observation plane that promptly contacts the German shore command. The commando group receives an order from the Admiralty to abort the mission due to RAF's inability to offer bombing support for the operation. To make matters worse, the alerted Germans sense something is afoot and watch the sea with added vigilance. Regardless, Major Jamie Wilson is a stubborn man who wants to prove to himself and to his superiors that he is a capable soldier.

The Power,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063452/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"One by one members of a special project team are being killed by telekinesis - the ability to move things with the power of the mind alone. The race is to determine which of the remaining team members is the murderer and how to stop them. Biologist Jim Tanner is part of a select government research team that includes beautiful geneticist Margery Lansing. Anthropologist Henry Hallson discovers what he believes is evidence of a person among them with psychic abilities including telekinesis. When he warns the team he is murdered the same night. When Tanner becomes a suspect in the murder he starts investigating the claims with help from Lansing.—Roland Dr. Jim Tanner has always been an expert on human endurance. As the film opens, he is the chairman of a committee of scientists, based at the laboratory of the Space Research Commission in San Marino, CA, tasked to find the limits of human endurance, and those factors that could best enable a human being, say a prospective space pilot, to survive extreme stress and to make instant decisions that could save his life in an emergency. But never before has Tanner found himself pushed to the limits of his own endurance.On a day like any other, Mr. Arthur Nordlund, US Naval liaison, visits his laboratory and observes some of Tanner's work, as four test subjects are undergoing endurance tests of direct neural stimulation, immersion in freezing-cold water, extreme heat, and high acceleration in a centrifuge. Though impressed, Nordlund is skeptical of the expense, though Tanner seeks to assure him that the work is necessary to the continued viability of the US space program. Biologist Talbot Scott interrupts Tanner, asks to talk with him privately, and warns him that another of their colleagues, anthropologist Henry Hallston, is scheduled to present his report on his human-intelligence survey, and is somehow convinced that all the committee members are ""being watched."" Scott is afraid that Hallston will embarrass the Committee in front of Nordlund, who is scheduled to attend.Tanner cannot put off Nordlund, so when the Committee sits, Tanner tries to put off Hallston instead. But Hallston will not be put off. His survey, in which the Committee members participated, reveals that one member--unidentified because the questionnaires were coded--is an unmeasurable genius, so much so that his genius might reward him with preternatural powers that others would be helpless to resist. The other members are openly skeptical, and Tanner despairs of the impression that Hallston is making in front of Nordlund, but Nordlund wants to hear more--and the laboratory's chief administrator, Norman E. Van Zandt, insists on allowing Hallston to have his say, if only to falsify his seemingly outrageous theories. But when physicist Carl Melniker sets up a test of telekinesis by placing a sheet of notepaper on an improvised spindle, and Hallston insists that everyone in the room try together to make the paper spin without touching it, the incredible happens: the paper does spin, slowly at first, then faster and faster.Tanner is inclined to ignore the whole thing, but his colleague and paramour, geneticist Margery Lansing, is not so sure. She asserts that such a genius could be born today. Then the telephone interrupts them, and at the other end is a frantic Sally Hallston who tells Tanner that her husband had gone to the lab to pick up his questionnaires and had not returned home.(In fact, Hallston has gone to his office, but never made it out. Someone--presumably the unidentified genius--has impressed on Hallston's mind that the knee-level swinging door has become a gate taller than he, and then a solid wall. After that, Hallston has suffered a heart attack and collapsed at his desk.)Reluctantly, Tanner drives back to the lab, with Marge in tow. Together they look over Hallston's office, which is unusual in appearance except for some signs that someone has fallen over the desk and spilled some papers. Among the papers, Tanner finds a memo sheet with the name ""Adam Hart"" scrawled on it. As he is trying to figure out who that person might be, they overhear the centrifuge starting up. Tanner and Marge rush to the centrifuge control room but cannot stop the centrifuge. Tanner rushes down the hallway to pull the main switch, and together he and Marge wait for the centrifuge to stop, and then open it. There they find Hallston, dead, his eyes and tongue still protruding from the high-acceleration forces he has suffered.The next day, a police detective oversees the removal of Hallston's body and interviews Tanner. That is when things begin to go seriously wrong for Tanner. First, the centrifuge's controls now work properly, contrary to Tanner's story (and experience). Then, the detective and Dr. Van Zandt both accuse Tanner of academic fraud, after Tanner's degree-granting colleges and graduate schools disavow any memory of his having ever enrolled, much less graduated. Then Talbot Scott abruptly refuses to have anything to say to Tanner, this although they had had a friendly conversation only five minutes before. Forced to resign his position, Tanner leaves the laboratory, but not before the detective hints to him that he is now a ""person of interest"" in what is now a murder investigation.Unable to figure out what to do next, Tanner wanders aimlessly in the tourist section of San Marino, only to have more weird experiences. A water-dipping bird on display abruptly straightens up, winks at him, then drinks from the water glass and spits at him. In another display window, a company of toy soldiers march smartly into formation, unlimber their muskets, aim at him, and fire! Then he tries to cross the street, but the pedestrian-traffic signal changes its message from DON'T WALK to DON'T RUN. He runs from the intersection and into a fun house, where he finds himself on an empty carousel (with a horse that winks at him) that begins to spin as fast as the centrifuge, and the carousel operator has to pull a main switch of his own to stop it and get Tanner off.By now, Tanner has had it. He realizes that someone who was at that Committee meeting has set him up. That person, presumably the mysterious Adam Hart, first murdered Hallston, then framed Tanner with the murder, somehow erased Tanner's academic record, and just now tried to kill him--but for a reason that escapes Tanner, failed. Tanner does not want to wait for another murder attempt, but decides to track Adam Hart down himself.He goes to Joshua Flats, CA, Hallston's hometown, and starts asking questions about Hart, first of a local cafe waitress (who seems unusually romantically interested in Tanner, a thing that also happened to him in the tourist section, but to which he paid no attention), and then of Hallston's parents. The witnesses variously describe Hart, who had been Hallston's schoolmate, as a genius and a sexual magnet. Then the local fill-up station operator offers to take Tanner to Hart's old hangout--but instead dumps Tanner in the middle of the desert next to an Air Force firing range. Tanner is nearly killed again when a squadron of Air Force jets starts strafing the range. He escapes only because he has the presence of mind to light a fire in the brush on the range, prompting the pilots to break off. Furious, he returns to the fill-up station, bursts into the operator's bedroom, and interrogates the operator, who confesses that Adam Hart gave him a standing order ten years earlier to kill any person who dared make inquiries about him. That this operator would blindly obey such a dangerous order after all these years only convinces Tanner further that he is dealing with an assassin with the very preternatural abilities that Hallston most feared. Now he knows the reason for Hallston's attitude: Hallston, having grown up with Hart, had felt instinctively that Hart was a very dangerous person. But Hallston is dead, and Tanner is now Hart's target.Tanner next goes to see Hallston's widow, who is no help. She now doesn't remember the name Adam Hart (though she had said that Hallston had mentioned him once), doesn't remember what her late husband looked like, and doesn't even remember Tanner, though for some weird reason she also seems romantically interested in him, though Tanner puts that down to her being drunk. Next he goes to the home of Margery Lansing, but is violently attacked by Carl Melniker, who earlier has invaded Marge's home, bound her, and lain in wait for Tanner, thinking him to be the unknown genius who had killed Hallston. Tanner manages to subdue Melniker long enough to convince him that he means him no harm, and unbinds Marge. The three scientists then try to have a rational discussion about what they're facing, and how to combat it--or survive it. The three decide that for now they don't dare fall asleep, so they drive to a hotel in nearby Santa Lisa, that his hosting a salesmen's convention, and in effect, crash the party. While there, Tanner sees a newspaper with several copies bearing a partial headline: DON'T RUN! This turns out to be part of a legitimate headline--but why the newspaper would run a banner headline about the city's mayor telling an opposing candidate not to run against him seems most strange. Later, despite their best efforts, Melniker winds up dead, and Tanner and Marge have to flee.Tanner and Marge next drive to the apartment complex where Arthur Nordlund lives. As they drive into the parking garage, they notice Nordlund abruptly suffering an apparent heart attack and then stumbling into an elevator. The elevator starts to go up, then starts back down, then gets stuck between floors. Tanner climbs to the top floor, enters the elevator shaft, and tries to climb down to the elevator by rapelling down the cable--but then the elevator starts to go up, threatening to crush Tanner. Tanner quickly lets himself down to the elevator cab, opens the trap door, enters the cab, and finds Nordlund, who is near death.Now that Hallston and Melniker are dead, Nordlund seems to have been attacked himself, and Tanner trusts Marge implicitly, Tanner now narrows his list of suspects to Van Zandt and Scott. Nordlund, who has now joined their group, urges a homicidal counterstrike against the unknown genius, but Tanner does not wish to kill a man indiscriminately, not without knowing which man is the right man. Tanner then visits Van Zandt's home, but succeeds only in speaking to Mrs. Van Zandt before realizing that Dr.Van Zandt suspects Tanner of murder. Then Tanner barely escapes alive when someone (not Norman Van Zandt) tries to run him down. He drives away, only to find himself in an out-of-control car with brakes that don't hold. He splashes into a river and escapes by unfastening the car's convertible top, and then is picked up by police. They take him to a hospital, where the detective first tells him that he is under arrest--for the murders of Dr. and Mrs. Van Zandt, who have died when their house burned down shortly after his visit to it. The detective also informs him that Nordlund has disappeared.Then comes word that Talbot Scott has locked himself in the auditorium at the laboratory, is armed, and has demanded to see Tanner. Tanner insists that he can talk to Scott and reason with him, and reluctantly the detective lets Tanner go to the laboratory. There he listens incredulously as Scott babbles disconnectedly about Tanner being the genius, and Scott's willingness to serve Tanner however he wishes if only Tanner will not kill him. In the end, the out-of-control Scott dies in a gun battle with police.At last Tanner realizes who is responsible for his set-up and the murders of his colleagues: Arthur Nordlund, otherwise known as Adam Hart. Instead of running, Tanner walks the corridor and looks at some notes that someone had left, concerning the effect of intense pain on the heart. Marge then reveals herself, telling Tanner that she is glad that he has stopped running and will now stand and fight--because she, too, realizes that Nordlund is responsible.Tanner confronts Nordlund directly in the corridor of the laboratory. Nordlund then unleashes his full telepathic fury against Tanner, seeking to hypnotize him into believing himself plunged into freezing cold, then searing heat, and finally into the unforgiving void of outer space. Somehow Tanner survives, though he physically collapses--but does not black out. Now he knows why Nordlund/Hart wanted him dead: there are in fact not one genius, but two: Adam Hart and himself! Now he fights back directly, and kills Nordlund by telekinetically squeezing his heart and holding it compressed.Marge tells Tanner, in wonderment, that she ought to have suspected earlier: Adam Hart would never have revealed himself by making the paper spin at the original meeting, and everyone else (except Van Zandt) had tried individually to spin the paper and failed, so therefore Tanner had been the genius all along. Nordlund had tried to kill Tanner after deciding that the world wasn't big enough for two such geniuses, and had eliminated his colleagues to dispose of all possible witnesses (except for Marge, perhaps because he hadn't had a chance to eliminate her yet). Now that Tanner realizes the kind of genius that he is, he and Marge leave the laboratory, with Tanner speculating idly on whether his newfound power will corrupt him--and unable to answer his own question."

Fear Chamber,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062960/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A scientist notices strange frequencies coming from within the Earth. He and his assistants discover a living rock underneath a volcano. They bring the rock to their lab and discover that in order to survive, it needs the hormones that are produced by humans when they are afraid. They then abduct and sacrifice young girls to keep the living rock alive.—frankfob2@yahoo.com Prologue: Doctor Carl Mandel [Boris Karloff], an aging scientist, has spent his life
looking for answers to the secrets of the universe. When his radio
telescopes picked up patterned transmissions coming from under a volcano,
he sent his assistants -- Mark [Carlos East] and his daughter Corinne [Julissa] -- to find it,
while he communicated with them from his laboratory where his faithful
colleague and psychologist companion Helga [Isela Vega] makes sure that he takes his
medicine and gets his sleep.Months later. Mark and Corinne have found the source of the
transmissions and brought it back to the lab. It is a rock, fashioned from
what Dr Mandel thinks might be ""primordial plasma,"" that is able to
communicate through an interface with Mandel's computer. It promises great
information about the universe, such as the location of diamonds, but
first it must be fed. It feeds on hormones that are released into the
blood when a human is experiencing great fear, so Mandel and Helga have
built a ""chamber of fear"" in order to procure the hormones needed by the
rock.Under guise of being an employment agency where young women are
solicited for potential foreign jobs and given lodging during the testing
period, Helga choses suitable donors to be awakened during the night and
made to run through the fear chamber (a maze filled with skeletons,
spiders, and scenes of torture) until they faint from fear. Then Mandel,
aided by Mark, Corinne, Helga, and other assistants -- a midget [Santanón], a bearded
guy wearing a turban, and the retarded strongman Roland [Yerye Beirute]) -- extract just
enough blood to feed the rock but not harm the donor. In fact, most donors
awake the next morning thinking they have merely had a bad dream. None of
the donors are ever harmed...well, except for the one girl, which Helga
has kept from telling Mandel, who is extremely adamant about not taking
human life.As the experiments continue, however, the rock seems to be becoming
more and more hungry. It has also evolved a tentacle which allows it to
reach out and grasp at things. When it uses that tentacle to grab a
victim, draw her in, and feed on her blood, Mandel realizes the potential
of the rock to become a murderer and cuts off the heat source it needs to
survive. The rock responds by interfacing with the computer as though it's
finally willing to tell its secrets, but Mandel begins to pull out the
power cords anyway. The strain of pulling out the cords causes Mandel to
collapse.With Mandel confined to his bed, Helga refuses to let the rock die.
She arranges some time away for Corinne and Mark and enlists Roland's help
in killing the midget and the turbaned guy. Between just the two of them,
Helga and Roland revive the rock and provide it with all the blood it
wants. It thanks them by spitting out some garbled data about diamonds.[Roland likes diamonds. Roland wants diamonds. Lots of diamonds.
Roland is friends with the rock. The rock talks to Roland, and Roland
talks to the rock. The rock tells Roland that he will be king of the
world. Roland wants to be king of world and have all the diamonds!]After reanalyzing the data, Helga has come to a chilling conclusion.
The rock's purpose has been not to educate scientists about the secrets of
the universe but to learn how to live on the surface of the earth. It is
now ready to relay its findings to others like itself who live near the
earth's core. Their plan is to take over the earth and feed on the blood
and fear of humans.Helga wants to kill the rock, but Roland won't let this happen to his
friend, so he chases Helga through the fear chamber and allows the rock to
feed on her. Roland then drives off in his car, yelling, ""I'm going to be
king of the world!"" just as Mark and Corinne return home. Corinne runs
straight down to the laboratory where she finds Helga with the life sucked
out of her and her father feverishly typing a new program into the
computer. The rock grabs Corinne with its tentacle. Mandel reminds her
that the rock feeds on fear and tells her not to be afraid. As Corinne
repeats over and over to herself ""I am not afraid,"" Mark takes over for
Mandel on the computer, fighting to run the program before the rock can
develop its own internal circuits, which will render it capable of living.
Mark is successful. As the computer wiring around them goes up in
flames, Mandel explains that the program required accessing every step of
the rock's growth process and then reversing it. The now dead rock begins
to crumble into bits, as Mandel expresses the hope that they were able to
stop it before it relayed its information to others like itself.
Meanwhile, Roland can be seen running around under the volcano, shouting
""Diamonds! King of the World! Diamonds!"" The volcano then erupts. [Original

Rakesh's truth is revealed when Randhir and Mahavir discuss marriage proposal of Rakesh with Archana. Archana is livid and reveals the truth about Rakesh's character. Rakesh is very angry at his insult.
meanwhile Ghasitaram romances Laali (Ameeta), who is also Archana's maid, but is chased away by Laali's dad (Yunus Parvez). Eventually love triumphs and Laali's father agrees to marry them.
At last, Archana takes her father's consent to marry Kamal. Mahavir has promised Archana to Randhir, but Archana flatly refuses to marry a skirt-chaser and a flirt. As Mahavir is adamant, Archana says she wont marry Kamal, but she wont marry Rakesh either. Eventually Mahavir relents and agrees to Archana's wish.Rakesh wants to kidnap Kamal and impersonate him to marry Archana. But his henchmen kidnap him thinking that he is Kamal. Archana and Kamal marry and enjoy their honeymoon at her father's estate. Archana learns that Kamal is ambidextrous.
Soon war breaks out and Kamal has to leave for the front. To his surprise, Rakesh has also enrolled in the army in the same battalion. One day, when they both are alone, Rakesh starts fighting with Kamal (& announces his plan to kill Kamal and impersonate him in Archana's life) and it carries on till one of them disappears underwater.Later, the remaining one comes to Archana's estate and they live together for some time. One day Kamal's superior comes to report the death of Kamal. Archana gets confused as her husband has been with her all the time. But his superior tells her that he could recognize Kamal anywhere and says Kamal is dead. Not sure of the identity of the man who is staying with her, she puts him to some tests (Covering a hill in 20 mins on horseback, which he did earlier) (Sing a song for her that he sang earlier) (Play TT left handed) and concludes that he is not Kamal (The horse started eating grass and Kamal is delayed) (Kamal is traumatized by the images of war, and cant remember the song) (Kamal picks up the TT in his right hand). But he says that he is Kamal and he came back because of the fear that he had killed Rakesh. Now he is sure that he didn't kill Rakesh as he had died in a battlefield. But no one believes him and he gets arrested.He is about to be sentenced to ten years of jail for cheating and rape (Randhir also testifies against him, including Archana, Ghasitaram and Laali's dad), when the real Rakesh (half face disfigured) appears and testifies that he is the real Rakesh. Rakesh admits that when he came out of the pond, he thought he killed Kamal. But then decided to take Kamal's place in the army and serve as a soldier. He fore-sake all of his usual habits and impersonated Kamal perfectly.Rakesh was injured in the war with the Chinese and was rescued by Tibetans. He was headed back to his military camp, when he saw the newspaper article on the case between Archana and Kamal. Rakesh wants to take advantage of this and re-enter Archana's life as Kamal, after the real Kamal is sent to jail. But his father's and Archana's testimony changed his thinking and he regards Archana as his sister, and thus decided to tell the truth.Everything is settled, Kamal and Archana happily reconcile and forgive Rakesh for his previous misdoings. Kamal later tells Archana that he failed in her tests to prove himself as Kamal because he lived in constant fear of having killed Rakesh."

They strip to their underwear and start kissing and caressing each other, when the redhead enters the room and berates the brunette for messing around with her man. As the film credits roll on the screen, the two girls roll on the couches and the floor, fighting. The redhead is the attacker, and the brunette presents just a little defense; the redhead also loses over to the couch and spills her onto it, placing her knee on the jealous girl's stomach, and pinning her arms to the couch.

The extremes of self-sacrifice in some of the characters such as Hisayo and Sugiura contrast too sharply with the animal brutality of Sasabayashi and Namie, and the result is more caricature than realism. The harsh selfishness of Ichiro¯ and the abrupt techniques used to present his interior thoughts (double exposure of a naked Yuri as he undresses her with his eyes) prevent him in the end from winning audience sympathy.

Having fled Germany with his family when he was eight, he is confronted with the dilemma of having to fight men from his birth country. Through dealing with challenging situations (e.g. he is appointed commander of Bernau, talks to many disillusioned Germans, and keeps getting attacked by scattered groups of German soldiers), he grows more confident that not all hope is lost for post-war Germany. Based on the diary entries of director Konrad Wolf, the episodic movie authentically portrays the protagonist's struggle to come to terms with his own past and identity.—c.winter Its April 16th, 1945. Soviet soldier Georg Hecker (Jaecki Schwarz) is announcing to German troops over a loudspeaker system that the war is over and they should surrender to the Russian army. Ich bin Deutscher (Im a German) Georg says. Georg and his parents left Köln, Germany when he was only 8 years old and Georg was raised in Moscow. He is now 19 and returning to the Fatherland as a Soviet soldier. Georg is traveling with his platoon through German towns on the way to Berlin.April 22nd 1945, the Russians are coming into the German town of Bernau. A section of troops are given the task of finding any Nazis in the town. The Russian General (Mikhail Glusski) makes Lieutenant Hecker the commandant and gives him control of the town. As soon as Georg and his troops are left alone, a very young German girl (Jenny Gröllman) appears. The girl is clearly in post traumatic shock from having lived through the war. She saw a woman commit suicide and feels that everyone is better off committing suicide. They girl lost her parents and his confused as to what she should do. She asks Georg if she should Stay in this town? Go home? Go west? They leave the girl and tell her to figure it out for herself.While in Bernau, the troops come across a house with a red flag. Checking if they are Soviet supporters, the troops instead find the towns Mayor (Erich Giesa) and his wife attempting to make a good impression on their new rulers by offering them wine and pretending to be communist sympathizers. The troops instead drink their wine and confiscate their house. As soon as the commandants quarters are set up, Georgs first order of business is to meet with a reverend who wants to hold a service in the town. We are not sure as to Georgs decision as the next scene is quickly ushered in. Georg is having a printer make copies of flyers that have been produced, and after he answers no to being either a Communist or Nazi party member, Georg appoints the old printer as the new mayor of Bernau.While in his quarters, Georg is fixing a tear in his uniform while a female Soviet soldier (Galina Polskikh) eats nearby. Soon thereafter, the same German girl that Georg spoke to briefly is brought into the room by one of the other Russian troops. The girl asks if she can sleep in Georgs quarters and he quickly tells her no. Through this act, the female soldier discovers that Georg can speak German. The girl expresses her fears of the Russian troops and, incensed, the female soldier begins to yell at the German girl about the terrible things that happened in her home town. The girl quickly replies I didnt do anything and its not my fault. Russian tanks arrive and continue through the town without stopping to assist the small number of troops in Bernau.Still in Bernau, Georg sleeps with the radio on and hears German news reports of 15 year old Hitler Youth and wounded soldiers carrying out the German counter offensive. Georg is awakened, given breakfast and then leaves. As he is leaving, he again comes across the German girl. They say nothing and only stare as the Soviet truck drives away.April 23rd 1945, trying to find a new place to set up headquarters, Georg and his troops find a Nazi supply unit. Being mostly officers, the unit does not believe Georg when he tells them the war is over and it is best that they surrender. The commanding officer says that he must file a formal request for permission to surrender.April 24th, 1945, driving farther into Germany, they come across a group of Russian soldiers about to execute a man who they believe to have been a Nazi camp guard. Georgs friend Wadim (Vasili Livanov) tries to convince them not to. After finding the German mans Nazi uniform, Wadim leaves and a gunshot is heard.At this point, the film shows actual footage of a Sachsenhausen concentration camp executioner explaining how he operated the gas chambers and the crematorium. A quick shot of Georg standing in a shower is shown, perhaps washing off the sins of his Fatherland. According to the executioner, 13,500 Russians were killed in this manner in only two months.Wadim and another soldier, Sascha (Aleksei Ejbozhenko), sit in a German mans apartment. They ask him how he could live under a Nazi regime, then the German explains to them the seduction of the Nazi party. Sascha takes records that belong to the man. As the German man explains the ideas of Germanness more, Sascha plays the records, while Gregor and Wadim look through German books to try and understand things better.April 30th, 1945, given a special mission as truce bearers, Wadim and Gregor approach Sandau fortress, which contains a number of SS officers. When they present themselves to the fortress, a rope ladder comes down and SS Colonel Lewerenz (Johannes Wieke) along with an adjutant (Jürgen Hentsch) greet Georg and Captain Heymann (Wadim). After being given the terms of surrender, Colonel Lewerenz says that the decision must be made by his fellow officers as a group. The adjutant returns with the news that the other officers refuse to surrender. Gregor and Wadim enter the fortress to try and reason with the other officers. Gregor and Wadim tell the officers that not only is Sandau surrounded, but so too is Berlin. The officers do not believe them and say that their intelligence says otherwise. Disregarded as Goebels propaganda, Wadim still tries to convince them it is best to surrender. They are told that those who surrender will be given extra rations and will be taken care of.Deeper into the fortress, a teenage soldier tells his commanding officer (Kurt Böwe) a harrowing story of how he single handedly destroyed a tank and its driver with a bazooka. The boy says that he was given a chocolate bar for his efforts. Disgusted that he only received sweets, the commanding officer gives the boy his own Iron Cross. Approached by one of the officers who talked to Wadim and Gregor, the commanding officer and he discuss matters, suggesting even killing Gregor and Wadim. The other officers along with Colonel Lewerenz decide that they will surrender only with the unconditional surrender of the German Army. Wadim and Gregor give them until 7am to surrender, or the Soviet army will storm the fortress.Gregor and Wadim are blindfolded and escorted out of the fortress a different way than they came. When they reach the exit, the same officers that escorted them to Sandaus exit, escape down the river on a raft. Gregor continues to warn the Germans of the impending attack via loudspeaker. They surrender only 5 minutes before 7am.May 1st, 1945 Gregor, Wadim, Sascha and their driver Dshingis (Kalmursa Rachmanov) speed down the autobahn swerving around the flaming wrecks of German automobiles. Celebrating the surrender of the German Army, soldiers dance and sing as officers sing, drink and make tiny meat filled pastas called pelmeni. The soldiers decorate the courtyard with lights and a band of German firefighters plays music. While enjoying their meal, the Soviet General comes into the officers dining hall and brings with him former concentration camp inmates who are to be their guests of honor for having resisted the Nazis. A coincidence, one of the inmates actually turns out to be an old family friend of Gregors. Sadly, Gregor does not remember him.Having had too much to drink, Gregor falls and hurts himself. He hears the voice of his mother who tells him that he is always doing things too early. He smoked when he was 8 and was drinking schnapps when he was fifteen. Wadim is discussing with one of the camp inmates and asking him how he should explain the war to children. Being a school teacher, Wadim is very confused as to what he should do. The inmate tells how Hitler came into power and Wadim still asks how he should clarify that Goethe and Auschwitz are both German names.May 2nd, 1945, the troops come to a small town in the countryside and appoint one of the former inmates as the new mayor. As they dive away, they play the war ballad about Jamara. While driving, Gregor discusses things with one of the other inmates. Gregor asks about how things were in Germany before the war. The inmate asks Gregor what he is planning to do after the war, Gregor ponders that maybe school is an option. The inmate jumps onto another truck as he tries to make his way home and Gregor whistles Jamara as they drive away.Gregor and his troops reach a clearing in a small valley and find a whole platoon of troops playing dominoes, volleyball and soccer, cooking and sunbathing. Gregor finds another soldier who is just as young, if not younger than he is. They talk briefly and then encounter a German counter offensive in which the German troops were disguised as Russians and using a Russian tank. In the exchange, the young soldier is killed. Gregor and his troops are able to get away.May 3rd, 1945, Russians discover that there are counter offensives going on all over Germany. The General reports that in every counter offensive, the Germans are disguising themselves as Russians. Gregor, Wadim, Sascha and Dshingis are stationed at a small farmhouse and are setting up a surrender site. The young children at the farmhouse dont like or trust the Russian troops, even though Gregor is a German. Along the road are wounded and weary German soldiers. Again over the loudspeaker, Gregor tells them to surrender. Slowly, one by one the troops cross over the river and the small footbridge that separates them from the road.Among the surrendered is the same young boy from Sandau who received the Iron Cross for his valiant efforts. The farm family then offers to take him in. Gregor begins to make friends with one of the German soldiers (Dieter Mann). While packing up to leave, they are attacked by a group of SS resistance soldiers from across the river. They begin to fire back and Gregors German friend even joins in. After the exchange, it turns out that Sascha has been killed. Enraged, Gregor announces over the loudspeaker that he will have vengeance and kill all of the troops for having killed his friend. They finish packing up, along with all of the German prisoners. Gregors German friend asks him to mail a letter for him, everyone packs up and leaves."

He gradually finds himself lured into a deadly and sinister mystery.—Ratravarman <gothic@goldendawncoop.org> Beginning with a confusing dream that, as we later learn, was part premonition, Paul Carver (William Sylvester) awakes from his nightmare on a flight to Morocco, seated next to an archaeologists, Dr. Otto Gunther (Edward Underdown). Carver is racked with guilt over the death of his wife and children in a car accident (as seen in his dream) for which he believes he may be responsible. Upon his arrival in Morocco, Carver goes to see a doctor at a clinic, only to learn that the doctor in question has recently died (it's never made clear what the purpose of his visit was, but the film hints that Carver may have been seeking the doctor's assistance in taking his own life). While trying to drown his sorrows at a bar, Dr. Gunther's address falls from his pocket, so Carver decides to find Gunther's home, despite it being night-time and Gunther's house being located in the old (read 'dangerous') part of the city. Stumbling along narrow, vacant lanes, Carver encounters a mysterious Arab named Omar (Terence de Marney), who speaks to him in riddles about the night, only to disappear. Carver arrives at Dr. Gunther's home in the midst of a party. While waiting in the foyer, Carver is attracted to a ring with a brilliant gemstone that he places on his finger, and then notices a beautiful and mysterious woman coming down the stairs, who we later learn is named Marisa (Alizia Gur). Dr. Gunther introduces Carver to his pretty young assistant, Chantal (Diane Clare). Chantal learns of Carver's recent tragic loss, but, instead of expressing sympathy, Chantal challenges Carver to snap out of his depression (later in the film Dr. Gunther explains to Carver that Chantal, too, had recently lost a loved one, Gunther's son who was Chantal's fiance). Carver remains curious about Marisa, the woman he saw earlier, and his curiousity is further aroused by fleeting glimpses of what seem to be Marisa during the party. Dr. Gunther invites his guests to come with him to see some of his most recent finds from an excavation he is involved in regarding a medieval Moorish royal tomb. Carver chooses to remain behind in the enclosed garden, where, alone, he encounters Marisa who, like Omar, speaks to him in riddles about the night. Marisa disappears and, when the rear gate of the garden swings open, Carver exits, following various signs (puffs of colored smoke, a veil blowing in the wind, etc...) out of the city and into the desert to an abandoned medieval palace. Entering an empty room, he encounters Omar who, upon repeating that the night can hide beauty as well as ugliness, claps his hands and the room is transformed: bright and new, filled with colorful tapestries and pillows on the floor, Carver sees Marisa lying enticingly on a couch and joins her, while a troop of dancing girls entertain them. Noticing the light from the ring on his finger, Marisa tears it off and throws it in the corner, but the light emitted by the gemstone on the ring continues to terrify both Marisa and Omar, who recoil in fear. Carver rises from the couch and, amidst the dancing girls, collapses on the floor. The following morning, while driving to their excavation site, Chantal and Dr. Gunther spot Carver lying unconscious in the desert outside of the abandoned palace and take him to the site of their dig. Needless to say, neither of them believe his story, Chantal dismissing it as a result of a combination of too much to drink and Carver's apparent death-wish. Chantal drives him to the abandoned palace in order to prove that what he described couldn't possibly have happened. Carver enters the room, which has returned to its state of desolation, but finds the ring in the corner where Marisa threw it. When he returns to Dr. Gunther's archaeological site, Gunther tells Carver that the ring was considered to be a talisman, used to ward away evil spirits. He explains that in ancient times a philosophy that originated in Persia took root in Morocco that taught that the world, both seen and unseen, was divided into good and bad, corresponding to light and darkness, day and night, and that the forces of these two sides were in a constant struggle, in which, sometimes, darkness prevailed (this 'philosophy' is actually the ancient Persian religion of 'Zoroastrianism', which was nearly wiped out by the Islamic conquest of Iran). That night, Carver returns to the palace, where he finds the the dead bodies of the dancing girls chained to the columns in the room. Omar appears and explains that this is what happens to those who offend 'The Servants of the Night'. Once again the room turns bright and new, with the dancing girls' bodies gone and Marisa on her couch. Carver joins her and they make love. The following day at the archaeological site, Chantal is upset by what she sees as Carver's macabre obsession with death and the night, embodied in what she believes is an imaginary figure, Marisa. She obviously has feelings for him, but doesn't know how to 'rescue' him. Gunther recommends that Chantal take Carver to the seaside, to get away from the abandoned palace and spend some time together, which she does. Intitially this seems to work, as they enjoy swimming in the ocean together. But Carver remains divided over his attraction to Chantal and his obsession with Marisa. During a shopping excursion in a bazaar, Carver sees a tapestry with Marisa's portrrait woven into it and is told by one of Dr. Gunther's colleagues, Dr. Leclerc (William Dexter) that it is a famous pattern that originated with a Princess named Marisa. It seems that the Princess Marisa was discovered to have been unfaithful and, as a punishment, was entombed alive by her husband. She instructed one of her loyal servants to strangle her husband in revenge, but he was caught and also buried alive with his mistress. Before her burial, Marisa swore vengence upon all men, whom she threatened to make her slaves. Dr. Leclerc informs Carver that, by coincidence, it is the Princess Marissa's tomb that he and Dr. Gunther have uncovered. With the pieces of the puzzle beginning to fall into place, Carver returns to the city, and Chantal follows. Chantal confronts Gunther, who now seems to believe that Marisa may be more than a figment of Carver's imagination. Determined to uncover the truth, Chantal arrives at the excavation site just as the sun is setting and enters the tomb. As she struggles to open the lid of Marisa's sarcophagus, Omar appears behind her and grabs her. Seeking to eliminate her rival for Carver's affections, Marisa instructs Omar to carry Chantal out into the desert where she will be a 'sacrifice to the sun' (that is, die of heat and thirst). Carver, learning that Chantal has disappeared, returns once more to the abandoned palace to confront Marisa. He now knows who and what she is and demands that she leave Chantal alone. Marisa tells Carver that Omar has taken Chantal out into the desert to die. She asks Carver who he really loves, Chantal or herself, the light or the darkness? Carver claims that he has chosen Chantal and that he doesn't love Marisa, but Marisa responds that she knows Carver better than he knows himself, stating that he is, in his heart-of-hearts, of the darkness. One of Marisa's servants knocks Carver unconscious and Marisa seizes the ring, which she smashes with a rock. Dr. Gunther arrives outside the palace in hopes of finding either Chantal or Carver. Carver explains that they must find where Omar has taken Chantal before it's too late. They drive out into the desert and spot Omar, who is tying an unconscious Chantal to some rocks. Carver attempts to fight Omar, but he's impervious to his blows until Dr. Gunther shines his flashlight in Omar's face, leading Omar to flee. Helping Chantal into the landrover, they pursue Omar, who is seeking to reach the safety of the tomb while the sun rises in the sky, only to disolve into a skeleton just short of his goal. Carver enters Marisa's tomb, but before he can drive a stake into her heart, Marisa states that, like it or not, she and Carver are of the dark and, as such, were meant to be together. Nevertheless, Carver hammers a stake into Marisa, whose body deteriorates into a skeleton. In a scene identical to one in his nightmare at the beginning of the film, Carver has to tear away Marisa's skeletal hand to free his own. Leaving the tomb, Carver slowly walks away from the archaeological site, mumbling to himself. Chantal, confused, asks Gunther what has happened. Gunther replies that ""He used to say always that he had cheated death. I think perhaps after all that it is death that has cheated him."" [Synopsis by Paul V. Walsh]"

Recognizing Chip's client as one of the most infamous Philippine traitors who collaborated with the Japanese in exchange for money, the Philippine guerrillas kill the man.

Chip finds out the Philippine guerrillas are attempting to salvage the national gold reserves from the clutches of the invading Japanese. The plan is to transfer the gold bullion onto a barge and eventually on board an American submarine waiting off shore. However, the approaching submarine is destroyed by a Japanese dive-bomber and the gold is left on the barge. Japanese warships are seen patrolling the coast line. The only solution seems to be the sinking of the barge and the gold stashed on top of it. The Philippine guerrillas plan to recover the sunken gold after the war when Japan would be defeated.

While sitting at the bar, a man well dressed all in black, Charlie, addresses him as 'Luke', pays him a whiskey, and asks where is Donovan, and if 'the killing is still going on'. He had rent a room in the saloon for Luke, already. Who hired them and who they are going to kill, remains unspoken, and Luke is not letting Charlie know that he lost his memory of what happened in the mountain with Donovan. ""Luke"" plays it cool and learns he's taken money to kill Victor Barret. The man in the saloon lays out the plan.""Luke"" is to walk right up to Dingus, pull a pistol, and kill him. Charlie will have a rifle in a case, put together with telescope lenses, and position himself on a hill a couple of hundred yards away, as back-up.The scene is a graveyard with a group of people standing around a tombstone draped with a battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia. The names on the tombstone are «Harry MacCalhoun - Jason Phillicote - Vladimir Landusky - Rusty Callagan - Burt Hunnicat - Willy De Soto - Luke Barret».Before the vote, the Doctor says that Barret and Rojas have not come to save the lands from the Southern bank, that he guarantees to provide them with the peons they need to cultivate their lands. Victor Barret arrives, and exhorts them to hold out, promising to help them. One man refuses, saying he barely broke even last year. Again, Victor promises to help like he did the year before. The farmer says, ""You took half my land for that help!"" Reluctantly, the men vote (with white pebbles) for Barret. MacCahoun is the first to pick a black pebble, and Doctor Barret puts pressure on him to think better.While that's going on, Luke is walking up to the group and is spotted by the local doctor who recognizes him as ""Luke!"" His admiration is explained by the fact that Luke Barret is one of the names inscribed in the tombstone. At the last second, 'Luke' pushes Victor out of the way and goes after Charlie on the hill, eventually killing him. Luke closes the killer's eyes, and is arrested by the Sheriff and two deputies.Luke is remembering a few things in flashes: a wife who was pregnant as he went off to war. She was murdered by Yankee soldiers, as was his father. Their mother has sank into dementia.Victor is unhappy with his cowboys; then he tells McCullom that the voting had only been postponed. The rancher tells him that he is decided to sell his lands to the bank. McCullom refuses further help from Victor in providing workers from Mexico, because Victor's price had been half of McCullom's lands already.In jail, the Doctor tries to get information from Luke, but Luke's memory is gone. The doctor tells him that his brother's name is Victor Barret.
Victor is informed by the doctor that the man in prison is doubtless his brother Luke, and Victor asks the Sheriff to free him. The Sheriff is not happy with Victor, as he suspects that Victor's henchmen had killed the deputies escorting the cart with the imported Mexican workers. Victor refuses any link with those murders, and the Sheriff let's Luke go.From the Southern Bank's upper floor window, Murphy the banker (Wolf in the Spanish version) and his secretary Rover, see Victor hugs his brother in the street. One blames the other for the idea that Luke could shoot his brother Victor. Victor does not seem surprised to see MacCullom's cart arriving at the main street with the man obviously wounded, and he takes his brother into the saloon.Banker Wolf accuses Barret of having killed MacCullom as he was heading to the bank to sign the contract, selling his lands. The Sheriff replies that there is no proof of that. Wolf goes to the saloon, and confronts Victor, telling out loud how his bank had been instrumental to the towns development; then, he accuses Victor of exerting pressure on the ranchers not to sell their lands to the bank, and recurring to murder. Victor slaps him hard, and he leaves.The Saloon Madam introduces her girls to Barret's table, where Luke and the doctor are sitting: a redhead in a blue dress, a black hair girl in a yellow dress, and Susan in a light blue dress. Victor takes Susan by the arm, and goes up to a room with her. Luke is not in the mood for girls; he walks out, and opens the cameo she gave him. he looks at the pictures of himself and a girl that does look like Susan, and the inscription on the back of the cameo reads «May 24, 1860, Appaloosa Ranch».He goes there alone, and he is recognized by the guard dog; then he is recognized by Mrs. Barret, even before he speaks, despite she is now a blind old woman with a walking cane. She takes him by the hand to see his father's tomb - marked with a small picture of the Doctor - and Susan, who had been pregnant when she died. Luke is also recognized by the black servant, Sam.Victor arrives, looks surprised to find Luke there, and takes him for a ride. He tells him that once that ranch had been theirs, and puts the blame of their family's losses to the Civil War.Meanwhile, MacCullom's Daughter sells her ranch to the bank and leaves for San Luis, to live with a relative of hers.Victor takes Luke to his ranch, where he seems to be well liked by the Mexican workers he has imported, and his Mexican headman, Juan. Victor tells Luke that their father had taken the Secessionists' side, and been killed by Unionist soldiers, what caused their mother's madness.
Luke surprises Victor - and the drunkard doctor - when he asks about his pregnant wife Susan. Victor says she too, had been shot by Unionist soldiers. Victor and Luke had been away with a guerrilla gang to fight the Norths army. Luke had later joined the Confederate army, and Victor had chosen to stay in the farm to defend it.Russell interrupts to inform Victor that the orphan of MacCullom had sold her ranch to the bank that morning.In the evening, Victor visits alone a tomb in the mountains, picks a rosary from the makeshift wooden cross marking the place, and puts it around his neck.At the Golden Girls saloon, Luke asks for a whiskey, but the Sheriff calls him to his table, and Joe the Barman opts to drink the whiskey himself.
The Sheriff prods Luke about the shooting of the man who had been there with Luke the night before. Then the sheriff asks about Donovan, a man who was supposed to have arrived with Luke. Luke does not give straight answers, and the Sheriff asks about Dingus, the name carved in the butt of Luke's rifle. Luke answers he doesn't know, and goes to his room upstairs. In bed, he is ready to answer an eventual attack, as he hears stealthy steps coming close to his room's door. [editing goof]Meanwhile, Terry (Henry in the Spanish version), his wife and child - new colons - are visited and terrorized by Victor and his men - to force them out of the land.Luke wanders through the mountains, followed from afar by a cowboy. Then he comes across Susan, who tells him she is the orphan of a Preacher and a woman named Atilia Sousa, and shows him the ravine where the local young men had died fighting the Northern soldiers. She confirms that Susan was pregnant of Luke, and was waiting desperately for his return. She tells him that Susan had died in her arms, and given her the cameo that she had left the night before in his room, telling her that it was Dingus who shot her. The girl does not know who Dingus was, or is. Yet, she knows that's how the Mexicans call bastard sons.That leads Luke to a Mexican tavern, to inquire about Dingus. The barman takes him to a house in darkness, where Luke is attacked and beaten up by strangers. The Sheriff and his deputy found Luke in the street, and now they hand him, still passed out, to Victor and the doctor. Victor orders Peter, the chief henchman, to gather all the men. He must step back from an open confrontation with Murphy, as the banker has taken precautions, and now he has a number of gunmen backing him, as well as the Sheriff and the deputies.Luke is getting fit again at Victor's ranch. He is curious about a gun with a modified, reinforced cannon. Victor explains how the gun operates, and says that their father died because he had not time to reload the powerful weapon. Luke asks a couple of questions, and the answers sound dubious to Luke, who just vows to find and kill the man who shot his father.Luke returns to the Appaloosa Ranch, expecting to get some answers from Sam, the faithful servant of his parents. He is received by a stray of bullets from various windows and doors of the house. He cuts loose the dog, and it attacks one of the gunmen inside. Luke shoots down half a dozen men. The last man he kills is the one-eyed man who had beaten him up in the dark house, whom he recognizes because of the particular shape of his spores.He finds Sam dying, who tells him just the killer's name: Dingus. His old mother died holding a little box with a family photo inside, which brings back a memory: a photographer had been called to take a photo of the Barret couple and their two sons, and then Luke with his newly wed wife Susan. His brother Victor is there, but he is not Dingus... Dingus had been invited, but did not attend, as he was with his dying Native American mother.Luke, Victor and Susan pay Dingus a surprise visit just after his mother died. Therefore, Victor was not Dingus, and Dingus was either a family friend or a half-brother born out of wedlock. Luke and Victor join the Southern guerrillas, but not Dingus who had left home alone some days before. The guerrillas are ambushed by Unionist soldiers, led by Dingus. Victor is shot by Dingus, and dies in Luke's arms.Luke remembers how he fled alone, and how Charlie recruited him, and also how his partner Donovan was shot by Peter when they were going after Dingus. Luke goes to Dingus' house, where he finds doctor Russel alone, dying, shot by Dingus and his men.Luke takes his father modified gun to go after Dingus. When they come at hearing distance, Dingus calls Luke ""my brother"", and Luke calls Dingus ""treacherous bastard"". In the subsequent gun battle, Luke kills all the hired gunmen, but then he is wounded by Dingus. At last, Luke says they're not brothers, but only sons of the same father...Dingus (literally a bastard) had been the fruit of a relationship of Mr. Barret and the daughter of an Indian chief; hence, after his mother's death, Dingus decided to kill all members of the Barret family, to take possession of their lands. At last, Luke kills Dingus with their father's modified gun - and Dingus dies on the barren land he considered sacred to his Indian ancestry."

Decline and Fall... of a Birdwatcher,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062872/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A naive young man, sent down from university, blunders through a series of bizarre adventures in which his participation is always innocent, although others don't think so. Decline and Fall is based on Evelyn Waugh's first published novel (in 1928), and tells the story of Paul Pennyfeather. Unjustly dismissed from Oxford University for indecent behavior, he embarks on a series of adventures which take him first to Llanabba Castle, a ridiculous private school of no academic stature in Wales, and then into the fashionable high-society world of Margot Beste-Chetwynde, the rich and glamorous mother of one of his pupils. On the point of getting married to Margot, he is arrested, convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison for involvement in the white slave traffic which is the source of her money. After a relatively short period of time in prison (where he meets several individuals who had also been academic colleagues at Llanabba Castle), he is released through the agency of Margot's new husband, the British Home Secretary Sir Humphrey Maltravers. Although in the book, Paul Pennyfeather resumes his studies as an Oxford undergraduate, studying to become a clergyman, the film ends with him walking off into the sunset to who knows what new adventures. Apart from Paul and Margot -- played by the seductively lovely actress Genevieve Page -- the story features a cast of characters who reappear in different contexts, notably Augustus Fagan, the proprietor of Llanabba, Philbrick the school butler (played wonderfully by Colin Blakeley), Prendergast, one of the masters, who later has his head sawn off by a deranged prison inmate, and, most memorably, Captain Grimes (Leo McKern), an unrepentant pederast, bigamist and drunk, for whom schoolmastering is just one more doomed venture in a career that only a man of great resilience could survive."

The Committee,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062820/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Experimental 1968 British satire with an exclusive soundtrack by PINK FLOYD. A hitch hiker decapitates the man having picked him up while stopped by the side of the road to fix the car's engine. A few day's later he gets summoned to a committee, where he engages in different conversations, yet fears that his summoning is linked to the previous incident.—T J-P This short experimental feature follows a young man (Paul Jones, vocalist for the band Manfred Mann) who is picked up by a successful but self-satisfied businessman (Tom Kempinski) while hitchhiking. Bored and exasperated with the businessman's prattle, the young man succumbs to temptation while the mogul checks the engine of his Mercedes Benz, bringing the car's hood crashing down on the man's head. Feeling remorse later on, he sews the businessman's head back onto his body, with the victim seeming no worse for wear. Years later, the young man is working with an architectural firm when he's called upon to join a committee led by a powerful government official (Robert Lloyd). It soon becomes obvious that along with his other duties, the man is asked to account for his actions, which could easily have led to another man's death. The Committee was shot on location at the London School of Economics, and features a musical score by Pink Floyd, which was composed and recorded shortly after Syd Barrett left the group. Influential theatrical rock combo The Crazy World of Arthur Brown also performs in the film.You're probably expecting some silly, psychedelic curiosity (ooh, Pink Floyd and Arthur Brown!), but this film's goals are surprisingly highbrow. The script's dark, surreal satire is more likely to recall Camus, Orwell and Kafka than Timothy Leary. The heart of the tale involves a world where, similar to jury duty, people are called away to serve on philosophical commitees for varying lengths of time. (One experienced participant remembers that his past group simply had to decide which of five oranges was the roundest.) Along the way, some vaguely drawn ideas about non-conformity and the individual's place in society dart in and out of the frame. The film's short duration doesn't allow such themes to be fleshed out, but perhaps it's just as well. Note that the lead character (credited only as ""Central Figure"") is portrayed by Paul Jones, the ex-Manfred Mann singer who starred in the equally bleak, rock-star satire ""Privilege"" around the same time. The Pink Floyd aspect is minimal (some organ-led noodlings such as heard on Ummagumma and More), but you do get an outrageous, onscreen performance from Brown, complete with flaming helmet. I regret that the other user review spoils the climax of the opening hitchhiking sequence, because I think this would be better left as an unexpected shock.Jimmy Gardner as Boss

Mare's Tail,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4859990/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"It begins with a meditative, vibrating drone in the dark auditorium and ends with a word scratched onto the film strip: REFLECT - an invitation to viewers to think about what they have seen, but also the description of one of the many techniques used by David Larcher in his two-and-a-half-hour experimental film epic. Such dual and multiple meanings are a recurring motif in the film, as is the desire to decipher the foundational structures of cinematic perception. There is a fascination for the psychedelic expansion of consciousness and for the complex web of relationships between experience and memory - the film can be read as both a hippie-esque, elliptical diary film as well as an encyclopaedia of experimental image systems. ""Mare's tail"" is the term used in England for elongated, fraying clouds resembling a horse's tail that herald a coming rain. And just as one must learn to first see this symbol and then interpret it, David Larcher teaches us cinematic seeing in a kind of creation story of visual representation, which is at the same time a section of the director's own history, bathed in the period colours of late 1960s.—Berlinale Forum"

"30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia",1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062625/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Rupert Street, a piano player and composer, decides to write a musical and marry before he reaches his thirtieth birthday. One minor problem: he'll be 30 in six weeks... British musician/composer Rupert Street is turning thirty on September 13th, six weeks away. He sees turning thirty as a milestone which will define the success or failure of his life. As such, he plans to write a stage musical by then, even signing a contract with his agent Oscar to hire the necessary crew to stage it by his birthday. The other goal for his thirtieth birthday is to get married, despite having no potential ""Mrs. Street"" in his life. He is hoping that it will be Louise Hammond, a young woman who has just moved into the same rooming house in which he lives. His hope is despite Louise already having a boyfriend named Paul and she stating early in their meeting that she has no intention of getting married. As Rupert pursues both his six week goals, they seem incompatible as he needs to spend quality time on both to get both. But things change closer to September 13th when reaching one goal seem predicated on achieving the other.—Huggo London jazz pianist and aspiring composer Rupert Street (Dudley Moore) is looking to have a 30th birthday to remember, marriage on the big day, but lacks a bride, and finishing a musical production in the six weeks that remain. He even tries to set an appointment with the magistrate without being able to name a bride., He also has set himself the no less formidable additional target of writing a musical, all motivated by fear of reaching that grand age having achieved nothing in life. All this he communicates to his friend Oscar (Eddie Foy Jr.) before driving off to take care of a more immediate concern, his laundry and obsessing how he does not measure up to the great composers.
Rupert arrives at his boarding house and is greeted by his landlady Enid Woolley (Patricia Routledge) collecting autographs for her niece and running a prenatal exercise class. Rupert learns a new boarder has moved in next to Street's room. Rupert reads a letter from his mother contained in his laundry package. The telephone in the hallway rings which is for his new neighbor Louise Hammond (Suzy Kendall) from a beau she dies not wish to marry.
Luck comes Rupert's way in the form of the gorgeous but taken Louise (Suzy Kendall), a fellow boarder. Rupert imagines himself as all sort of classic romantic characters that might interest Louise. In frustration, Rupert screams out loud which gains Louise's attention. Louise invites Rupert in for coffee. Rupert learns Louise has an art education and taught school for a couple years. Their conversation is interrupted by a phone call from Rupert's agent Victor (Peter Bayliss).
Victor insists Rupert arrive in four minutes to meet the director, Horst Cohen Jr. (Ted Dicks), as well as a choreographer and a naive backer of his yet unwritten musical. Rupert signs a contract committing him to the project, though he is obviously distracted by his encounter with Louise. When Rupert returns to his boarding house, Louise invites him to share some lunch. Rupert ends up kissing Louise on the floor after a musical fantasy of ""The Real Stuff"" but Louise is seeing her boyfriend Paul (Nicky Henson) that evening.
At the club, the Jox Box, the club owner Jock (Duncan Macrae) is instructing his hostesses, the Clan girls, when Rupert arrives. Later, Rupert plays a jazz piano arrangement when he spies Louise and Paul in the audience. After the show, Rupert witnesses Paul insisting the Louise move in with him and marry him. Louise resists. Rupert steps in to defend Louise. The inevitable bust-up with competing suitor Paul leaves Rupert with right arm in plaster and unable to play. Oscar suggests leave town while he cannot play to write his musical. After a tiff with Louise about misinterpreted comments, Rupert sees the need of freedom from distraction. Rupert and Oscar depart for Dublin.
While Rupert is away, Louise relocates outside the boarding house. Initially Rupert is uninspired, though highly fuel by coffee and annoyed with Oscar's endless stories. On a walk with Oscar, Rupert strays away and listens to an Irish story teller who spins the tale of the ill-fated love story of Michael and Moira who are torn apart by the lying schemes of Michael's brother Black Sean Dur and never find their reunion until they Re near death and rise to heaven together. Inspired, Rupert, doing his best imitation of Handel completing the Messiah in Dublin, completes his musical in three weeks. Industry and inspiration abound and Rupert returns to London triumphant having met his deadline for the show.
Rupert and Oscar return to Rupert's boarding house and is enthusiastically greeted by Mrs. Woolley. Rupert imagines a romantic reunion with Louise but quickly learns she has moved away and the room is occupied by Barry. Rupert looks for a letter from Louise, but learns that Mr. Woolley (Harry Towb) tore them up in a drunken rage, jealous over his wife and her phonograph albums of Geraldo.
Odds of achieving the other half of his plan look remote, though, as the the pieced together postcard reveals that Louise has left for Birmingham with the persistent Paul and Rupert must go in pursuit if he is to be married in the few days remaining till his birthday. Before Rupert travels by train, he sets the date of his marriage to Louise Hammond with the magistrate.
Meanwhile, Rupert's agent Victor is pressured by the production's major investor on to lock up his creative work in a contract amendment or he will prevent the show from opening. Victor sends private eye Herbert Greenslade (John Bird) to Birmingham to hunt down the missing composer. Greenslade quickly finds Louise but Rupert remains elusive on the streets of Birmingham, though there are some narrow misses. Louise is also worried about Rupert. Rupert finally catches up with Rupert in a train car and leads him back to Louise who accepts Rupert's proposal of marriage. Reunited by Greenslade on Rupert's birthday, the couple rush back to London so the show opening can go on, via the marriage registry.
After the wedding ceremony, Louise discovers that Rupert had applied for the marriage license three weeks prior, and realizes Rupert's desperation was not for her but a desire to be married before his 30th birthday. That evening Louise is missing when Rupert is interviewed prior to the opening of his show, The Golden Legend of Erin. Numerous intoxicated Irish men crowd into the balcony. When the curtain opens, Louise's seat is empty. Oscar has inserted himself into the show which plays as a farce, rather than a romance. As he officially turns 30 his wristwatch, Rupert realizes his marriage and his play are in shambles. However, the audience loves the show and cheers raucously with appreciation. Rupert finds Louise on the side of the stage and declares his love to her. All is forgiven and the couple leave the show early to enjoy their wedding night.
The next morning, the papers declared Rupert's satirical show a critical success. Rupert also reads that a child born nine months hence when there is a full eclipse of the sum will be smiled on by the gods. Rupert leaps on Louise to begin the new project."

Les Gauloises bleues,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063002/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The movie explores the love, or lack thereof, of a spouse and a parent, absurdities and tragedies of life, growing-up and death, and humanity under various social and political influences.

The title refers to the cigarettes he was buying from her when he met her while down on his luck. They fall in love but constantly fight, while he resorts to crime. The movie's many artsy vignettes vary widely between provocative interviews and dialogue, symbolic scenes of Ivan as a child stomping a gift of bread into the ground, surreal images of death, absurdities of silly bureaucracies and indifference in hospitals, scenes of political upheaval mixed with innocent images of a children's book, and so on. This is a hodgepodge of subtly impressionistic scenes that come together to weave a character study and portrait of life. At times it was a wonderfully surreal and intriguing artistic creation.—Anonymous"

Phedre,1968,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205317/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the absence of her royal husband Theseus, thought to be dead, Phaedra declares her love to Hippolyte, Theseus's son from a previous marriage. Marie Bell, once of the Comedie Francaise, enacts the role of the tormented Phedre, enamored of her stepson Hippolyte (Claude Giraud). He in turn loves Aricie (Tania Torrens), a captive. The king, father to Hippolyte and husband of Phedre, is thought dead. When Theseus (Jacques Dacqmine) proves to be alive, tragedy takes its toll. An stylized version ofJean Racineclassic, released in 1972 in the U.S. with the French text translated by English subtitles taken fromWilliam Packard's Alexandrine translation, the film is mainly a series of monologues by the characters. Acting is good and Packard's rhyming English titles are beautiful in themselves. ""To seeMarie Bellin Phedre is a unique opportunity to experience fully what is French Genius."" -André Malraux. According to Greek legend, Theseus returned from war with the Minoans on Crete to become king of Athens and took Phedre, the daughter of the vanquished King Minos to be his wife. Phedre fell in love with the Kings son, Hippolyte, but he did not return the love, preferring one his own age. Phedre caused her husband, the King, to be wrongly jealous of his son and prayed to Neptune to destroy him. When Hippolyte was in fact killed after fighting a sea monster, Phedre killed herself in remorse. Starting with this basic legend,Jean Racine, the dramatist considered ""the most French of French writers,"" adapted the story for the stage in 1677.His pure Alexandrine verse, realistically portraying the characters, has led to a continuing appreciation of his works. Marie Bell, thought of so highly by the contemporary French author and statesman Malraux, possesses a classic background in keeping with the purity of the legend and tradition of the French adaptation. A member of the Comedie Francaise since 1928, she began her film career in 1924 and was a remarkably well-preserved 68 years old when she undertook the portrayal of this tragic figure. Her decoration for valor in the French Underground during the war was the Legion of Honor, awarded by General DeGaulle himself. Phedre therefore, comes with a French pedigree as authentic as the Eiffel Tower. A powerful film of human emotion in the style of a classic Greek tragedy."
