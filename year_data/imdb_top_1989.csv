Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097576/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1938, after his father goes missing while pursuing the Holy Grail, Indiana Jones finds himself up against the Nazis again to stop them from obtaining its powers. An art collector appeals to Indiana Jones to embark on a search for the Holy Grail. He learns that another archaeologist has disappeared while searching for the precious goblet, and the missing man is his own father, Dr. Henry Jones. The artifact is much harder to find than they expected, and its powers are too much for those impure of heart.—Jwelch5742 In 1938, two years after the quest for the precious item inRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981), bullwhip-wielding archaeologist Indiana Jones risks life and limb searching for his missing father, Professor Henry Jones. And picking up where the estranged parent left off while searching for the Holy Grail, Indy visits Venice, Italy. Then, a faint trail of clues sends the intrepid adventurer to cold Austria, where he encounters the statuesque archaeologist Dr Elsa Schneider. But a dangerous run-in with vicious SS commander Colonel Ernst Vogel spells trouble. Because, more than anything, the power-obsessed megalomaniac is bent on finding the location of the sacred artefact at all costs. This time, there is much at risk. In this high-stakes mission, are two Joneses better than one?—Nick Riganas Famed archeologist Indiana Jones is in for the adventure of his life. When he receives a mysterious journal in the mail, Indy realizes that it was his father, Henry Jones Sr. who sent it to him. The journal holds clues and a map that leads to the legendary Holy Grail, to which Indy's father has been hunting for all his life. When he goes missing, Indy must pick up where his father left off and work to uncover the true location of the Grail. Little does Indy know is that his Nazi foes are on the hunt for the Grail as well for their own nefarious intentions. Now with help from Marcus Brody and Sallah, Indy must rescue his father and race to the Grail before the Nazis can get their hands on it.—Blazer346 Indiana Jones, famed adventurer and archaeologist acquires a diary that holds clues and a map with no names to find the mysterious Holy Grail, which was sent from his father, Dr. Henry Jones, in Italy. Upon hearing from a private collector, Walter Donovan, that the mission for the Holy Grail went astray with the disappearance of his father, Indiana Jones and museum curator Marcus Brody venture to Italy in search of Indy's father. However, upon retrieving Dr. Henry Jones in Nazi territory, the rescue mission turns into a race to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do, who plan to use it for complete world domination for their super-race. With the diary as a vital key and the map with no names as a guide, Indiana Jones once again finds himself in another death-defying adventure of pure excitement.—commanderblue The story opens in Monument Valley, Utah, in 1912. A troop of Boy Scouts are exploring the area. One of the Scouts, Indiana Jones, finds a cave where where a party led by a mercenary wearing a fedora and leather jacket finds the cross of Coronado, a priceless Spanish American artifact. Indy, believing it belongs in a museum, takes it and is pursued, attempting to escape by horseback. He is followed by the mercenaries in autos, but boards a circus train to elude them. While on the train, he crawls through a car full of snakes (thereby providing the backstory for his ophidiophobia) and then finds himself in a car with a lion, from whom he escapes by using a bullwhip he finds hanging on the wall, in which his first attempt backlashes and gives him a cut on his chin (explaining the origin of his scar, a real scar borne by actor Harrison Ford). After a few more dangerous encounters, including a near castration by the horn of a rhinoceros annoyed by the tussle on his roof, Indy escapes the train through a magician's magic box and takes the cross home, where his father is busy working on drawing that looks like a stained glass window. When Indy excitedly tries to tell his father about it, his father rebuffs him, telling him to calm down by counting to 10 in Greek.Moments later a fellow scout whom Indy had sent for the Sheriff when he discovered the illegal dig returns with the sheriff; but he is dismayed to find that the burly businessman wearing a panama hat who had hired the mercenaries had also bought the law, and Indy is forced to surrender the cross to the looters. However, before the head mercenary leaves the house, he says to Indy ""You lost this time, Kid, but you don't have to like it"",and puts the fedora on the boy's head. As Indy smiles the scene fades and the scene changes to 1938 aboard a freighter in a violent Atlantic storm. Indy has tracked down the cross, but is again confronted by the man in the panama hat and his henchmen. He grabs the artifact, fights off the crew and dives into the ocean scant seconds before a massive wave collapses the ship's funnel, causing it to fall onto a load of explosives. As Indy grabs a life preserver from the wreck, he sees the panama hat sinking nearby. As the hulk of the ship sinks, the name is visible on the bow: Coronado.Indy returns to his university and after a moment of comic relief almost identical to the similar scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" gives the artifact to Marcus Brody for the museum, then goes to his office, where he is surrounded by a phalanx of students. His secretary Irene gives him a ream of papers to be graded as well as phone messages and a brown paper package from Venice, which he absently stuffs in his pocket. After sitting for a moment in his artifact cluttered office, he sneaks out through his window but is greeted by three men who step from a sinister black sedan. They ask him to accompany them to an elegant penthouse apartment. He meets Walter Donovan, a generous donor to the museum. Donovan is apparently an oil magnate whose drilling team has uncovered fragment of a stone marker dating to the 12th century near Ankara, Turkey. The marker is read by Indy, and to his surprise it details ""the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ"" - the Holy Grail, whose waters can grant immortality. Donovan's project leader has deduced that a second marker, left behind by a knight who had found the Grail, is somewhere in Venice, but a major snag has occurred, as the project leader and all his research have vanished, to the concern of his assistant, Doctor Elsa Schneider.To Indy's surprise, his father is Donovan's project leader, and when Indy and Marcus find Henry's house ransacked and his mail opened, Indy suddenly remembers the package he got from Venice - his dad's diary, in which is contained all his father's research on the Grail.Indy and Marcus fly to Venice, where Donovan has arranged apartments for them, and they meet with Schneider. She gives them a written note by Henry that contains only the Roman numerals for three, seven, and ten. The group goes to where Henry disappeared, the Venice library, which was once a church in ancient Roman times. A stained-glass window dating from the sacking of Byzantium gives Indy a clue that the library is the tomb of the knight. Indy pries open the floor and finds a network of tunnels containing oil. Exploring the tunnel with Elsa - and in the process passing a wall painting of ancient antiquities such as The Ark Of The Covenant - Indy finds an ancient casket and a knight's shield, the second marker.However, Marcus is slugged by members of a cult sworn to preventing discovery of the Grail; the cult sets fire to the oil in the tunnels but Indy and Elsa escape through the city sewers. Indy and Elsa are pursued by the cultists on speedboats before Indy dispatches one boat and corners the group's leader, a member of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, descendants of soldiers sworn to protect the grail with their lives. Indy learns from him that his father is a prisoner in the castle Brunewald near German-Austrian border.Later, after drying out, Indy arranges for Marcus to meet Sallah to begin finding the Grail while he and Elsa go after Henry. He finds that his room and Elsa's have been ransacked by men looking for the Grail diary, making him all the more determined to find Henry and also the Grail. The two fly to the German castle and Indy finds Henry, but both are double crossed by Elsa, and to both men's horror they find that the string-puller in this whole affair is Walter Donovan, who wants the ancient cup to give him immortality. Indy and Henry are bound in the castle but Indy manages to break out, in the process setting off a fire. He and Henry commandeer a Nazi motorcycle and escape pursuing German soldiers, but Henry stops Indy's trek of escape to make him go back to Berlin, where Donovan and Elsa have taken his diary for Hitler. When Indy demands to know why the diary is so important, Henry explains that it details traps that protect the grail and keys to defeating them. Indy also confronts his father about his obsession with the grail and receives a slap from his father when he blasphemes.Indy and his father trek to Berlin, find Elsa standing with Hitler and his highest staff at a Nazi party book burning. Indy retrieves the diary, in the process tempted to strangle her. During his departure from the rally, Indy comes face-to-face with Hitler himself, who adds his signature to the book.Indy and his father go to the Berlin Flughafen to escape. Indy books tickets aboard a dirigible. However, they are forced to leave the dirigible using the search plane attached underneath. They are chased by Luftwaffe fighters and are forced to land when Indy's father shoots the tail off their own plane with its machine gun. They steal a car and escape one plane that crashes into a tunnel, but a second one drops a bomb that destroys their car. Henry ""suddenly remembers my Charlemegne"" that drives him to send seagulls flying into the path of the second fighter, which flies into the swarm and crashes.Reaching the desert area of Jordan, Indy and Henry rendezvous with Indy's pal Sallah, where they learn that Marcus, whom Indy had given a map from the diary leading them to the Grail itself, was captured by Nazi agents and taken to Donovan. Tracking down Donovan's exploration group, Indy, Henry, and Sallah see it is escorted by a company of Nazi troopers with a World War I-vintage tank. When desert guerrillas led by the group that attacked Indy in Venice ambush the convoy, Henry uses the cover to try and rescue Marcus, but both are seized by the Nazis. Indy pursues the tank and a prolonged fight ensues where Marcus and Henry attack the soldiers inside and by a mixture of clumsiness and force succeed in killing them, then use the tank to blast the convoy. Indy rescues the two of them but the tank drives off a sheer cliff, Indy barely escaping.The four men soon track down Donovan's remaining group at a temple carved in a cliff (Petra) in which is the path to the Grail. The traps within have already killed several of Donovan's group, and when Indy and his pals are seized, Donovan sees Indy as his chance. To force Indy to find the Grail, Donovan shoots Henry, leaving the healing power of the Grail as the only chance to save Henry's life. Indy thus enters the dangerous pathway, deducing how to avoid its traps and finding the chamber of the Grail. He succeeds in reaching the grail chamber where one of the original knight brothers still lives and must choose the correct grail from many false ones.However, Donovan and Elsa enter before he can, and Elsa chooses a cup for Donovan. She knows it is an incorrect choice, and Donovan ultimately ages to death for drinking from the wrong grail. Indy then picks the true grail, drinks from it proving it to be the true one and is warned by the knight that the grail cannot be taken beyond the great seal in the outer chamber thus forcing those who wish to use immortality provided by it to remain in the temple.
Indiana takes the grail and uses it to heal Henry's wound. All is settled until Elsa decides to leave with the grail, setting off a mammoth quake inside the vast temple. Elsa hits the ground and the grail rolls into a large fissure in the temple. Elsa almost falls in herself, but is saved by Indy at the last moment. Elsa, instead of letting Indy lift her up, pulls one of her hands free to try and reach the grail resting below her. She can almost touch it, and so she keeps on reaching, despite Indy's pleads to give him both her hands. He cannot maintain his grip on Elsa's slippery leather gloved hand, and before Elsa can grasp the cup, her hand slips out of its leather glove. Elsa falls to her death and Indy near does too, but his father catches him. Indy tries to reach the grail himself, but Henry gets through to him and the two ultimately escape the temple. When Jones Sr. calls Indy ""Junior"" Sallah asks what it means. Jones Sr. tells him Indy's full name ""Henry Jones, Jr"" a moniker that Indy himself detests. Jones Sr also reveals that ""Indiana"" was the name of their dog when Indy was a child. Sallah finds the revelation very funny. Led by a victory cry from the inept Brody, the four then ride off on horseback into the sunset."

However, the South Africans are protected by diplomatic immunity and so the duo are assigned to witness protection duty in an attempt by their captain to keep his job. It is only when this witness reveals to them that he has already dealt with the smugglers that the trouble really starts...—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> The story opens in the middle of a car chase through the 4th Street tunnel in downtown Los Angeles. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), partners in the LAPD's homicide division, are in pursuit of a red BMW, while their colleagues are converging on the car from the opposite direction. It's a suspected drug bust.Murtaugh is driving his wife's new station wagon. He's driving slower than Riggs wants him too, especially through the tunnel, where there's not much room to maneuver. The cops back at the precinct station, who are listening in with their Chief, are taking bets on the outcome of the chase.A blue car with more bad guys appears and pulls up next to the red BMW. The bad guys have radios and the police can hear them speaking in an unfamiliar language. Murtaugh speculates as to whether they might be Japanese, figuring that because the car radios are Japanese, maybe the Japanese bought the L.A.P.D. too, since ""they own everything else.""A man in the blue car passenger's seat leans outside the window and puts a shotgun blast through Murtaugh's station wagon windshield. Riggs kicks the cracked windshield out. The female police dispatcher advises them that shots were fired. Riggs sarcastically thanks her for the heads up.One police car is forced to swerve to avoid a head-on collision, but runs into a camper trailer, hitting its propane tank and the vehicle explodes in flames. The blue and red cars split off in different directions. Murtaugh and Riggs continue pursuing the red car. The driver of the red car swerves onto a sidewalk, but Murtaugh gets caught up in traffic and has to stop.Riggs jumps out of the car and races past all the stalled cars stopped in traffic, somehow catching up to the red car. As the red BMW makes a slow left turn, Riggs jumps onto the hood with his gun drawn and shouts at the driver that he'd like to see crook's ""driver's license and proof of insurance!"" Riggs falls off the car as it lurches. The driver pauses and raises an automatic weapon and squeezes of a few rounds before Riggs can shoot back and speeds off again.Riggs takes off running after the BMW again, up a slight grade. Murtaugh catches up to Riggs and tells him to get in the car. Riggs insists on driving and pushes Roger over. Roger moves, but warns Riggs not to put a single scratch on the car. They approach traffic congestion on a bridge and Riggs puts the car's left wheels up on the curb scraping the side of the station wagon along it's entire length. He jokes that Roger was right and there wasn't enough room to keep the car from being scraped up badly.The blue car spins out as it approaches an elevated intersection with all lanes blocked. Two men jump out and start shooting at the police. The police return fire. A helicopter flies up from under the elevated portion of the road and the bad guys jump in and it flies away. Meanwhile, Riggs and Murtaugh are still after the BMW, which loses control and crashes through the front window of a store, coming to rest upside down. Riggs and Murtaugh are temporarily stalled when a police car blocks their path, but once it moves out of the way, they hurry up to the crash site. Riggs tells Murtaugh that they will rush the car on the count of three. He counts three and takes off, but Murtaugh is still struggling to get out of the car.The driver of the BMW is gone. Riggs blames Murtaugh for not rushing forward on his count of three. Murtaugh protests and they briefly argue about what exactly on the count of three means. Hearing a noise, and thinking the suspect might be in the trunk, Riggs kicks it open and hundreds of South African krugerrands (gold coins which were illegal in the U.S. at the time due to the South African apartheid government), spill out.Back at the precinct, Captain Murphy (Steve Kahan) is very upset at Murtaugh for all the damage that had resulted from the high speed chases, shootings and crashes. He said it's coming out of the department budget. Murtaugh sarcastically tells the captain to pay it off in krugerrands. The captain notes how the arrest was just supposed to be a routine drug bust. Murtaugh can only say that things ""got a little bit out of hand.""Other detectives are standing around taking bets on whether Riggs can escape from a straight jacket they put him in, specifically whether he could do it in less than five minutes. Everyone cringes when he is able to escape by dislocating his shoulder, then he slams it back into place against a partition while the police psychiatrist (Mary Ellen Trainor), looks on, distinctly unamused. Riggs calls her ""Mrs. Sigmund Fraud."" She asks him why he does that to himself and he says none of the other guys would let him do to them, and besides, he needed the money. One of the guys tosses down a gold kruggerand to pay off the bet, but Murtaugh confiscates it and yells out that it was evidence and whomever had it shouldn't have taken it.Murtaugh tells Riggs that his oldest daughter, Rianne Murtaugh (Traci Wolfe), is going to appear in a commercial that is scheduled to debut that evening on Channel 8 at 8 p.m. Against Murtaugh's wishes, Riggs announces it to all the detectives. Murtaugh is worried that if Rianne stinks, the squad members will tease him unmercifully about it.As Murtaugh and Riggs leave the station for the day, they approach Murtaugh's station wagon, which looks like it's been in a demolition derby. A mechanic is standing over it and tells Murtaugh that the windshield, hood and other parts are all on order.At Murtaugh's home, Murtaugh shows Riggs the new additions to the house that are being built, a 2-car garage and hobby room over it. He plans to retire at age 52. The carpenter McGee (Jack McGee) is using a power nailer and when he discharges the tool, it startles Murtaugh and Riggs and they draw their weapons and point them at the carpenter. He didn't appreciate that. The carpenter also doesn't trust Murtaugh when he asks to see the nail gun, so after just a few seconds the carpenter takes it back from him.Inside the house, Roger's wife, Trish Murtaugh (Darlene Love), gets the family organized to watch Rianne's commercial on television. Even the carpenter has come inside to watch. Roger takes a bite of a sandwich and when the family learns it's tuna, they criticize him in unison, telling him they are boycotting the consumption of tuna because when it is harvested many dolphins get caught in the nets and are killed. Before Roger can argue with them, the commercial comes on.Rianne appears on the beach, dressed in a swimming suit and cavorting with some friends. She gets close to a young man and they exchange a kiss. The advertisement is for Ramses Condoms. Roger gets very upset, orders the family upstairs and Rianne's boyfriend, George (Allan Dean Moore), to get out of the house. The carpenter tells Murtaugh that he thought it was a very good commercial, and it made him want to go out and buy some rubbers right away. Murtaugh gives him a severe look and the carpenter turns and leaves the house. Murtaugh is mostly thinking about how he's going to be teased at the office -- Riggs begins haranguing him as he leaves the house to clear his head.Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland), is in his office when one of his goons, a man named Hans (Mark Rolston), comes in. Rudd orders Hans to step onto a large sheet of plastic, explaining that he's having some painting done. Rudd is not happy that Hans lost one million dollars in gold Krugerrands when he crashed and abandoned the red BMW. He says a few words to another of his goons, Pieter Vorstedt (Derrick O'Connor), who is standing to one side. Vorstedt suddenly pulls a silenced pistol from under his jacket, points and shoots Hans through the forehead. Hans falls over onto the plastic sheet. Vorstedt begins to wrap the plastic around the body. Rudd tells Vorstedt that the police are becoming an intolerable nuisance and need to be dealt with. He hands Pieter a file on Roger Murtaugh and tells him that Murtaugh is the detective in charge of the investigation, indicating that Murtaugh needs to be paid a visit. Vorstedt notes that Murtaugh is black, a ""goddamnt kaffir"".Riggs is fixing chili at the Murtaugh's and is alone in the kitchen with Trish. She'd found a gold pen in his shirt that she laundered. He tells Trish that the pen reminds him of the night he lost Vicki, his wife. Since they had never really talked about how Vicki died, Riggs explains the association of the ink pen with her death. It was on a night that Riggs was supposed to have dinner with Vicki, but he forgot about it, so she was out driving alone when her car was involved in an accident and she died. He identified her body at the morgue and used that gold pen to sign the form.Riggs lives in a trailer house, right on the beach, with his dog Sam. He goes home and he and Sam watch an episode of the Three Stooges on his small television.Four hooded men break into the Murtaugh's home and surprise Roger and Trish in their bedroom, binding their limbs and mouths with duct tape. One of the men is Pieter, who tells Roger he and his people need to back off on the case involving the Krugerrands, or his family will be at risk. After the men leave, the children come rushing into the bedroom and release them.The next day, Roger tells Riggs what happened, and that he'd sent Trish and the kids to a relative's for awhile. Murtaugh and Riggs wonder if the attackers might be South Afrikaaner, based on their accents. The thugs' racist behavior towards Murtaugh is a clear metaphor for the apartheid government's abuse through its racial segregation in the country.Believing that Murtaugh can use an easier assignment after the attack in his home, his supervisor, Captain Murphy charges the duo with protecting a star witness in a federal drug case. The witness is Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), and the assignment should only be 2-3 days, until federal agents come to get him. Murtaugh and Riggs call it a ""shit assignment,"" but Murphy doesn't ""give a fuck"" what they think.Riggs and Murtaugh go to the Marriott Hotel to hook up with Getz. After Riggs flirts with some women in the hotel Jacuzzi, pretending to be a hotel employee, they meet Getz in his sixth floor room. Not happy with the assignment, they are rude to him. That surprises Leo, but he seems pretty thick-skinned about it and gives as good as he gets. Riggs and Murtaugh take over the main bedroom and make Leo move to the smaller room. Leo decides they are playing a game of ""bad cop, bad cop"" with him. When a waiter arrives to deliver Leo's lunch, the turns out to be a hit man, pulling a pistol he'd hidden in the cart, and attempts to shoot Leo. Leo grabs the hit man's arm, fending him off just long enough for Riggs to launch himself full speed into both of them. The force of his attack drives the hit man, Leo and himself through the window of the room and they fall six floors below into the swimming pool.The hit man is able to escape when Riggs mistakes Leo for the hit man (Leo has a small tablecloth over his head) and begins pummeling him in the face. After they get out of the water, Riggs demands to know what Leo witnessed such that it would cause someone to want him dead. Leo tells them that he'd laundered half a billion dollars in illegal drug money, a fact that Riggs & Roger find astonishing.Later, at Roger's house, Leo explains the process, getting all excited and uttering his trademark, ""ok, ok, ok,"" as he talks. The reason he was in trouble is that he was skimming some of the profits and his clients found out. Riggs and Murtaugh ask for names, but Leo said he only worked with couriers and not directly with the drug dealers. He didn't learn the names of any of the couriers either. However, he was able to remember one time when someone took him to a house on stilts and mentioned a man named Hans.Leo remembered that the house on stilts was on a hill overlooking Los Angeles and that the address consisted of four numbers. Two of the numbers were the year he graduated from accounting school and the first number was ""9,"" his lucky number. With that information, they narrowed the house number to just two possibilities, but they didn't know the street, so using an atlas, they arrived at about six streets to check out. The ninth house they checked turned out to be the one, and Riggs wastes no time approaching. He grabs some gear and pretends to be a pool cleaning man, even though there was no pool at the house. He's confronted by two men, whom he immediately disables and handcuffed before others in the house were attracted by the scuffling and come out shooting.One of the men inside the house is the same man who posed as a waiter at the hotel and had tried to kill Leo. He runs away and commandeers a tow truck on the street. Riggs pursues and jumps on the car being towed, then makes his way up to the tow truck and engages the driver in a fight. Murtaugh and Leo jump in the station wagon and follow.During the furious chase and fight, Riggs loses his balance and nearly falls off the tow truck, dropping his gun in the process. Murtaugh stops his car and Leo jumps out and retrieves Riggs' gun. Riggs falls over the top of the tow truck's cab when the driver suddenly slows down, but Riggs is able to catch himself on the bumper winch and hold on. Approaching traffic cause the truck driver to have to come to a sudden stop and Riggs loses his grip and falls onto the road. Murtaugh is following so closely that he can't stop in time and rear ends the car being towed, sending it flying up and over the tow truck and head on into a small pickup coming the other direction. A surfboard on the small pickup comes lose and goes flying straight into the windshield of the tow truck, immediately killing the driver.Back at the stilted house, Riggs and Murtaugh are joined by others from their squad and they come upon men removing boxes from the house. The police order the men to stop. Rudd and Pieter appear and demand that the police leave the premises, as it's considered South African property, given that he's the Minister of Diplomatic Affairs for the South African Consulate in Los Angeles. He shows them the documentation. When Riggs asks Pieter his name, Riggs doesn't quite understand and says, ""I'll just call you Adolph.""Rudd asserts that he and his people are immune from U.S. laws, via the Diplomatic Relations Act, and may not be detained for questioning and certainly not arrested. Riggs calls Rudd a ""dickhead."" Rudd tells Riggs that if he tries anything, then he'll have to deal with the U.S. Department of State, and then they'd see ""who is the deekhead now, hey?"" Vorstedt seems a bit taken back when Murtaugh orders Riggs by name to remain calm, as if he knows him.A beautiful woman, Rika Van Den Haas (Patsy Kensit) drives up as Riggs and the other police are leaving. Riggs opens the door for her and she drops a briefcase as she's getting out. She and Riggs bump heads as they both bend to pick up the briefcase. She's Rudd's secretary and is bringing the briefcase to him. Riggs is immediately attracted to her and begins flirting with her. She is obviously attracted to him as well.Riggs and Murtaugh are making their case with Captain Murphy, who is not happy that he's going to have to personally apologize Rudd for the violation of his diplomatic status. Riggs and Murtaugh try to convince the Captain that Rudd and his henchmen are practicing a new version of the ""Triangle Trade."" What used to be molasses-to-rum-to slaves, is now drugs-to-dollars-to-Krugerrands. The captain is further infuriated when he meets Leo and learns he's been running around on the case with Riggs and Murtaugh.Murtaugh approaches his desk, and finds a small tree made out of condoms sitting on it. He lets out a loud moan and everyone in the room breaks up laughing. After a few seconds, Murtaugh can't help but laugh himself.Rudd and his men take Rika home to her apartment and as they are dropping her off, Rudd attempts to explain to her that the black policemen in Los Angeles do not like South African whites because of the policies and conditions in South Africa. He appears to be trying to woo her and doesn't want her to find reasons not to like him. As he returns to his car, Rudd tells his men that because things are getting out-of-hand with the police, he wants to move the cash they have on hand in one large shipment.Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo go through a Subway Sandwich Shop drive-thru. Leo ends up with a tuna sandwich, and isn't happy about it. He refuses to eat it, then he decides the people at Subway screwed up the order, so he starts ranting about how they should never go to a drive-thru because the employees know they will never see you again and they fuck you over.Riggs begins harassing Rudd, following him when he drives anywhere in his car and even joining a crowd protesting apartheid. He makes sure that Rudd sees him every time.When Riggs returns home he finds Leo there cleaning up the place (Riggs lost his argument with Murtaugh about where Leo should spend the night). Leo had even kicked Sam out of the trailer while he worked. Riggs tells Leo to leave his place alone. Riggs has to scramble around to find his phone when it starts ringing. It's his office telling him that Roger hasn't been heard from since last night. Riggs and Leo go immediately to Roger's home, where Riggs kicks open the front door and goes in with his gun drawn. Leo announces that he'd cover the back door and sprints around there.Riggs finds Murtaugh upstairs, sitting on his toilet, legs numb and sweat on his forehead. He tells Riggs that he'd just been relaxing and reading his copy of Saltwater Sportsman magazine, when he glanced at the roll of toilet paper and saw that someone had written, ""Boom, you're dead."" Murtaugh had to sit there like that all night.Riggs gets on his hands and knees, to look behind the toilet, and confirms that there was a bomb back there containing C4 explosive. Roger doesn't want him to call the bomb squad, but realizes they have to. Murtaugh asks Riggs not to use the police band and keep the incident private, however the fire department and reporters show up, creating a huge scene on the street. The police psychiatrist comes too, but after seeing Murtaugh on the toilet, she decides to leave. Leo intercepts her and starts asking her about a disturbing dream he had.Jarvis (Kenneth Tigar), the bomb squad supervisor, oversees preparations; he wants Murtaugh to jump into the bathtub, which will withstand the blast. Jarvis' men put liquid nitrogen on the bomb which will delay the explosion a few seconds and give Roger time to get in the tub. Jarvis also orders Riggs out. Riggs refuses telling them that Roger can't make the jump alone since his legs are numb. After the bathroom is cleared of everyone, except Riggs and Murtaugh, the two share a moment of mostly unspoken fondness for one another, as there's a good chance they will die. Murtaugh does make an attempt at levity by wondering why they couldn't have planted the bomb in Trish's stove, and which Riggs notes would have saved a lot of people a lot of suffering (Trish wasn't much of a cook).Riggs climbs into the bathtub and grabs Murtaugh's hands. They agree to count three and then Riggs will pull Roger into the cast iron tub, and they will pull the bomb blanket over the top of them. Riggs counts and they go. After the massive explosion, that sends the fully intact toilet out over the yard and onto the Murtaugh's station wagon windshield, Roger and Martin are amazed that they both survived and were not injured, other than their ears hurt a lot.The next day, Leo pretends to be a Mr. Jones and he approaches a man at the immigration desk at the South African consulate office. He tells the man that he needs help convincing his friend, Alphonse, not to go to South Africa. Leo says his friend is there and he calls him in. It's Murtaugh. When the consulate employee sees the black Alphonse, he immediately agrees with Leo that Alphonse should not travel to South Africa. Murtaugh then launches into a tirade against apartheid and insists that the people need to eliminate it. During the diversionary disturbance, Riggs is able to sneak into the building and make his way into Rudd's office. He grabs a piece of paper from a notepad on the desk and puts it in his pocket, just as Rudd, Pieter, and four other men come into the office.Riggs had been able to hide behind the door as they filed in, then he closes it, drawing everyone's attention. When Rudd orders his men to show Riggs to the street, Riggs knocks two of them to the ground, then draws his gun and orders the other men to keep their hands away from their weapons. He tells Rudd that he and his people should fold up their tent and get the fuck out of the United States, or he'd fuck their ass and send them home with their balls in a sling. Rudd calls Riggs a ""kaffir lover"" (referring to blacks).The situation is pretty tense, and to make sure he can get out ok, as well and to emphasize his point, Riggs shoots the glass of a large aquarium set in the wall, causing the water and fish to cascade everywhere. The men are all busy trying to save Rudd's exotic African Knife fish as Riggs opens the door, gives them a mock Nazi salute and leaves. On the way out, he encounters Rika. She asks what he's doing there and he tells her he was just up shooting the breeze, and fish, with her boss.Riggs is picked up by Roger and Leo in the station wagon. They laugh and tell Riggs about their experience there at the consulate. Leo got a real kick out of the immigration employee being shocked when he first saw Roger, and observing, ""but, you're blick!"" Riggs shows Roger the piece of paper he found in Rudd's office. The words ""Alba Varden, Thursday"" are on it. Roger thinks there's something familiar about the name ""Alba Varden"" but he can't quite place it.As they drive away in the Murtaugh's wife's wrecked car, Leo sees a deli and wants to stop and get something to eat. Despite being told to stay in the car, he insists on getting out and opens the left rear passenger door. A passing car hits the door and tears it off the hinges.Rudd notices the missing sheet from his paper pad and tells Vorstedt it's time to take stronger actions with the police.Riggs follows Rika to a grocery store and threatens to embarrass her if she doesn't agree to have dinner with him at his place. She's reluctant, but has no choice but to agree when he makes a scene at the market. He takes her back to his trailer, where he notices her staring at his wedding ring. He tells her that he was married once, but offers no more details. She admits that she doesn't like her boss, Rudd, and hopes that he gets in trouble for whatever it is he's up to.As Riggs and Rika are beginning their evening together, Pieter Vorstedt and his men retaliate against the police, murdering police officers Jerry Collins (Grand L. Bush), shot while exercising in gravity boots at his home; Meagan Shapiro (Jenette Goldstein), killed by a bomb placed under her diving board; and Tom Wyler (Juney Smith), Tim Cavanaugh (Dean Norris), and several others, killed by a bomb rigged inside Cavanaugh's stereo that went off while they were playing cards.Riggs and Rika evict Sam via the doggy door in the floor of the trailer and they spend several hours of bliss making love.Roger had to miss his poker game with Cavanaugh and the others because he had to watch Leo. Leo, meanwhile, was helping Roger put together his income taxes. As Roger looks over his receipts, including one for his boat, he suddenly remembers what ""Alba Varden"" means; it's the name of a cargo ship that he had noticed in a family home video of his birthday aboard his own fishing boat.Roger rushes to his house, leaving Leo alone in the car, finds the video and confirms his recall. Meanwhile, Leo is accosted by Rudd's men, who drive away with Leo and Murtaugh's car. Roger is attacked inside his house by two other men, one at a time. He manages to kill the first with a nail through the forehead, using the nail gun that the carpenter had shown him earlier, then he uses the nail gun to put three nails in the chest of the second man. Murtaugh catches his breath and says, ""nailed 'em both."" He then remembers Leo and runs out to find him and the station wagon gone.Riggs' and Rika's lovemaking is interrupted by Sam, when he sticks his head through the doggy door and barks at Riggs. Riggs senses something is amiss and he listens carefully for a few seconds, then orders Rika to get dressed. Riggs looks out the window and sees two approaching helicopters. He tells Rika to get down on the floor, just as automatic weapons fire starts shredding the walls of the trailer.Riggs and Rika escape through the doggy door and Riggs shouts at Rika to get to his truck once the shooters pause to reload. When one of the helicopters sets down and four men jump out and continue shooting into the trailer, Riggs comes up behind one of them and twists his body so another shooter hits his own man in the chest, then Riggs uses the dead man's weapon to kill the shooter. He then jumps on top of his trailer and kills the other two shooters, and the helicopter pilot. The second helicopter appears and Riggs heads for his truck.He jumps in with Rika and she furiously pounds on his chest, demanding to know who those people are. Riggs says he doesn't know and asks her what she's doing Saturday, then he puts the truck in gear and takes off. He slows down to wait for Sam, who's running to catch up, then has to take time to return fire at the second helicopter, hitting at least one man on board, and forcing the helicopter to turn away.Riggs takes Rika home. She agrees to let him stay with her, since his place is all shot up. He sends her on to her apartment, promising to return later, but as he's getting into his truck, Pieter ambushes and knocks him out. While two other men walk inside to grab Rika, Sam can be seen in the back of the truck, lying low.After Riggs regains consciousness, he finds himself on a pier, bound in a tarpaulin and chains and face-to-face with Vorstedt. Vorstedt tells Riggs that four years ago, when Riggs was working narcotics in Long Beach, and was unknowingly getting close to nailing Rudd, Vorstedt was then contracted to kill Riggs. However, the person in the car he ambushed was not Riggs, but Riggs' wife Vicky. He tells Riggs that she took a bit of time to die. Riggs lunges at him but is held back and then dropped into the water near the pier. He executes his shoulder dislocation maneuver and frees himself from his bonds. As he turns to start up to the surface, he comes face to face with Rika, who had been thrown in the water earlier and drowned. Riggs surfaces, gasps for air, then climbs out of the water and grabs a short length of chain draped across a small boat motor. He ambushes the two men, who were still up on the pier. He snaps the neck of one and shatters the skull of the second by smashing it through a car window, then repeatedly slamming his neck between the car door and the door jam. Riggs forces his shoulder back into place then dives down and retrieves Rika's body and takes her to the beach. Sam sits quietly by as Riggs walks aimlessly on the beach, carrying Rika's body as he grieves.Riggs eventually calls Roger, telling his partner that ""they killed them both"" (Vicky and Rika). He tells Murtaugh that he is no longer a cop tonight, that it was now personal and he was going after Rudd, Vorstedt and the others. Roger tries vainly to talk Riggs out of doing anything rash, but realized he was probably wasting his breath. He quietly removes his own badge and takes off to intercept Riggs near the house on stilts.Leo is captive inside the house on stilts, where one of Vorstedt's men is repeatedly hitting Leo across the face. He refuses to tell Vorstedt anything having to do with how he stole their money.Roger intercepts Riggs on the road short of the house. Riggs warns him not to try and talk him out of it. Riggs says he heard on the radio about the murders of their fellow officers, and that they've declared war on the police. Roger just asks if Riggs has a plan. Riggs tells him to go around to the front of the house and wait for his signal, and then charge in and start shooting. When Roger told Riggs that Leo was inside, Riggs tells him to be careful of Leo. Roger asks what the signal will be, Riggs tells him he'll know when it happens.Riggs wraps a steel cable around one of the steel support stilts of the house and hooks the other end around his rear axle. He then starts violently lurching the truck forward over and over, jerking the support structure loose and causing the house to shake. At first, the inhabitants think it's an earthquake, but when they look out, they sees the truck and Pieter snaps off a few shots at Riggs before he gets out of the house.Roger shoots two bad guys from outside the house, then rushes in and gets Leo out just before the house comes crashing down. Riggs jumps out of his truck and jumps up and down in celebration. When he rejoins with Roger and Leo, he learns that ""Adolph"" had escaped.Leo is told to return to the police station and wait for the federal marshal. He's reluctant to do that until Murtaugh tells him he can use the siren on the way there. Before Leo leaves, he gives both Murtaugh and Riggs hugs.Murtaugh and Riggs head for the docks in search of the cargo ship, the Alba Varden. Murtaugh tells Riggs that it's scheduled to sail for South Africa. They find the ship and see three men standing near a container waiting to be loaded onto the ship. They ambush the men and take their weapons, then break into the container to investigate. Inside, they find Rudd's Mercedes sedan and numerous pallets piled high in shrink wrapped United States currency, in multiple denominations, likely hundreds of millions. Murtaugh grabs a handful of one thousand dollar bills, considering how it would easily pay for his children's college educations. Riggs suggests he keep it, but Murtaugh thinks better of it and puts it down.The container doors are suddenly shut and locked on the outside. Rudd decides that Riggs and Murtaugh can just ride along with them to South Africa and orders the container loaded onto the Alba Varden. Riggs comes up with a plan. As the container pauses directly over the ship, the doors suddenly burst open and the Mercedes comes flying out, accompanied by thousands of bills. The car explodes in a fireball and the bills flutter down into the water and into the hold of the ship. Rudd observes, shocked, then he calmly orders his men to make sure that Riggs and Murtaugh die.As Rudd's men start shooting down into the water, Riggs and Murtaugh grab onto ropes, preparing to rappel down into the hold of the ship. Murtaugh is a bit reluctant, wanting Riggs to go first, but Riggs gives Roger a nudge over the edge, then follows. Riggs shoots two of the bad guys on his way down. Once on the ship, Riggs shoots two more men. The second man is recipient of about 15 shots fired by Riggs, who shouts the names of Vicki and Rika as he's blasting away.Roger shoots and kills one of the bad guys, then Riggs takes down another. Roger makes his way up on deck. Riggs, still in the hold, suddenly takes a knife in the calf of his right leg. It was thrown by Pieter, who then rushes forward and starts delivering vicious round-house kicks to Riggs' body and head.Roger shoots another bad guy while Riggs finally musters enough strength to start fighting back against Pieter. Pieter grabs the knife in Riggs' leg and gives it a twist. Riggs yells in agony, then pulls the knife and Pieter's hand away from his leg. In the ensuing tug of war for the knife, Riggs forces it into Pieter's chest and jerks it sharply upwards. As Pieter falls to the deck, Riggs turns and walks away, noticing the control to the hoist for the container. Pieter isn't dead and pulls a pistol from a holster on his lower leg, preparing to shoot Riggs, but Riggs reaches out and pushes the button that releases the container poised high above and it drops, crushing Pieter. Riggs smiles and begins to walk away.Murtaugh spots Riggs from an upper deck. Riggs acknowledges he's ok when Rudd suddenly appears up on deck and shoots down at Riggs, hitting him 2-3 times. Roger then calls out to Rudd to drop his weapon. Rudd holds up his South African diplomatic I.D. and reminds Roger that he has diplomatic immunity. Roger pauses a moment, then shoots Rudd through the forehead, saying ""it's just been revoked!""Murtaugh hurries down the ladder and over to Riggs, fearing he was dead. Roger starts yelling out, ""breathe Riggs, you're not dead until I say you're dead!"" Surprisingly, Riggs moves and he asks Murtaugh to reach into his pocket and get his cigarettes. Once Murtaugh has the pack of cigarettes, Riggs asks him to throw them away, saying ""those things will kill ya!""Riggs wonders about Rudd and the others. Murtaugh tells him the bad guys ""have been de-kaffir-nated."" The two of them break up laughing, Riggs complaining that laughing hurts. Sirens can be heard in the background. Riggs looks deep into Murtaugh's eyes and tells him, ""you really are a beautiful man...give us a kiss before they come.""The two buddies keep laughing and joke as the story ends."

Reunited with the no-nonsense Zeddemore, nerdy nearsighted Louis, and their ever-industrious secretary Janine, the heroes of the hereafter must put a stop to an enormous underground river of slime ready to rot the roots of the entire Big Apple. Now, if your hometown was on the verge of being sucked down into the 10th level of Hell, who else would you call? After saving New York City from the demi-god Gozer, the Ghostbusters (Egon Spengler, Ray Stantz, Peter Venkman, and Winston Zeddemore) are sued for the property damage they caused, and barred from investigating the supernatural, forcing them out of business. Ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children's entertainer with Winston, Egon works in a laboratory at Columbia University conducting experiments into human emotion, and Peter hosts a pseudo-psychic television show. Peter's former girlfriend Dana Barrett has had a son, Oscar, with an ex-husband, and works as a restorer at the Manhattan Museum of Art. After an incident in which Oscar's baby carriage is controlled by an unseen force and drawn to a busy junction, Dana turns to the Ghostbusters for help. Meanwhile, Dana's colleague Dr. Janosz Poha is indoctrinated by the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian, a powerful seventeenth-century tyrant and magician trapped in a painting in the gallery. Vigo orders Janosz to locate a child that Vigo can possess, allowing him to return to life on the New Year.The Ghostbusters' investigation leads them to illegally excavate First Avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped. Lowered underneath, Ray discovers a river of pink slime filling an abandoned pneumatic transit line. Attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample, Ray accidentally causes a city-wide blackout, and the Ghostbusters are arrested. They are found guilty of investigating the supernatural, but before they can be taken away, the slime taken as evidence reacts to the judge's angry outburst and explodes, releasing two ghosts that proceed to devastate the courtroom. The Ghostbusters imprison the ghosts in exchange for the dismissal of all charges and that they be allowed to resume their Ghostbusting business.Later, the slime invades Dana's apartment and attacks her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter, and the two begin to renew their relationship. Investigating the slime and Vigo's history, the Ghostbusters discover that the slime reacts to emotions, and suspect that it has been generated by the negative attitudes of New Yorkers. While Peter and Dana have dinner together, Egon, Ray, and Winston explore the underground river of slime. While measuring the depth, Winston gets pulled into the flowing river, and Ray and Egon jump in after him. After they escape back to the surface Ray and Winston begin arguing, but Egon realizes that they are being influenced by the slime, so they strip off their clothes. They also learn the river is flowing directly to the museum.The Ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions, but are dismissed; the mayor's assistant, Jack Hardemeyer, has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's interests as he runs for governor. Meanwhile, a spirit resembling Janosz in the form of a nanny kidnaps Oscar from Peter's apartment, and Dana pursues them to the museum alone. After she enters, the museum is covered with a barrier of impenetrable slime.New Year's Eve sees a sudden increase of supernatural activity as the slime rises from the subway line and onto the city streets, causing widespread paranormal activity with ghosts attacking citizens. In response, the mayor fires Hardemeyer and has the Ghostbusters released. After heading to the museum, they are unable to breach the power of the slime barrier with their proton packs. Determining that they need a symbol of powerful positivity to rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use positively-charged mood slime, and a remix of ""Higher and Higher"" to animate the Statue of Liberty and pilot it through the streets before the cheering populace. As they arrive at the museum, the slime begins to recede and they use the Statue's torch to break through the museum's ceiling to attack Vigo and Janosz.Janosz is neutralized with positively-charged slime, but Vigo immobilizes the Ghostbusters and attempts a transfer into Oscar's body. A chorus of ""Auld Lang Syne"" by the citizens outside weakens Vigo, returning him to the painting and freeing the Ghostbusters. Vigo, now a grotesque beast, momentarily possesses Ray, and the other Ghostbusters attack him with a combination of proton streams and positively-charged mood slime. Dressed in full Ghostbusters attire, Louis attacks the weakened slime barrier around the building with a proton stream of his own. This combination destroys Vigo and changes the painting to a likeness of the four Ghostbusters standing protectively around Oscar. Outside, the Ghostbusters receive a standing ovation from the crowd and, at a later ceremony to restore the Statue, the Key to the City from the mayor."
The Little Mermaid,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097757/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mermaid princess makes a Faustian bargain in an attempt to become human and win a prince's love. In Disney's beguiling animated romp, rebellious 16-year-old mermaid Ariel is fascinated with life on land. On one of her visits to the surface, which are forbidden by her controlling father, King Triton, she falls for a human prince. Determined to be with her new love, Ariel makes a dangerous deal with the sea witch Ursula to become human for three days. But when plans go awry for the star-crossed lovers, the king must make the ultimate sacrifice for his daughter.—Jwelch5742 Suffocating in her father King Triton's vast undersea realm, the young and rebellious mermaid princess, Ariel, yearns for a new life above water, on the unexplored dry land. Hopelessly head over heels for the charming mortal prince, Eric, desperate Ariel summons up her courage to come to an ill-advised arrangement with the ocean's cunning and terrible sea-witch, Ursula, in high hopes of winning his heart. However, Ariel has only three days to succeed. Will she see her wish come true?—Nick Riganas Unhappy with her life as a mermaid, the princess Ariel dreams of living a life on the surface world. Only problem is that her father, King Triton has forbidden all contact with humans. When Ariel saves handsome Prince Eric from drowning in a storm, she is determined to find a way to be with her prince charming. To do this, she strikes a deal with the ruthless sea witch Ursula for three days as a human, unaware that it is all a part of Ursula's evil plan to overthrow Triton and rule the seas.—Blazer346 Loosely based upon the story by Hans Christian Andersen. Ariel, youngest daughter of King Triton, is dissatisfied with life in the sea. She longs to be with the humans above the surface, and is often caught in arguments with her father over those ""barbaric fish-eaters"". She goes to meet Ursula, the Sea Witch, to strike a deal, but Ursula has bigger plans for this mermaid and her father.—Tim Pickett <quetzal@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au> Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is dissatisfied with life under the sea and curious about the human world. With her best fish friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts and goes to the surface of the ocean to visit Scuttle the seagull, who offers very inaccurate and comical knowledge of human culture. Ignoring the warnings of her father (King Triton) and head maestro (Sebastian the crab) that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden (the sea's primary contact with humans involve fishermen, so King Triton considers humans as nothing more than mere predators), Ariel still longs to be part of the human world; to this end she has filled a secret grotto with all the human artifacts she has found. (""Part of Your World"") Sebastian, who is assigned to watch over Ariel and be sure she does not visit the surface again, tries to convince her that its better to live under the sea than in the human world (""Under the Sea"").One night, Ariel, Flounder and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the birthday of Prince Eric, with whom Ariel falls in love. A sudden storm hits, during which everyone manages to escape in a lifeboat except for Eric who goes back to rescue his dog Max. He almost drowns saving Max but is saved by Ariel, who drags him to the beach. Although it seems that his heart isn't beating, Ariel notices that Eric is breathing. She sings to him but dives underwater when Max returns to Eric. Upon being assisted by his chancellor (Sir Grimsby), Eric has a vague impression that he was rescued by a girl with a beautiful voice; he vows to find her, and Ariel vows to find a way to join Eric. (""Part of Your World (reprise)"")Triton and his daughters notice a change in Ariel, who is openly lovesick. Triton questions Sebastian about Ariel's behavior, during which Sebastian accidentally reveals the incident with Eric. Triton furiously confronts Ariel in her grotto, using his trident to destroy her collection of human treasures. After Triton leaves, a pair of eels, Flotsam and Jetsam, convince a crying Ariel that she must visit Ursula the sea witch, if she wants all of her dreams to come true.Ursula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days (""Poor, Unfortunate Souls""). Within these three days, Ariel must receive the 'kiss of true love' from Eric; otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid on the third day and belong to Ursula. As payment for legs, Ariel has to give up her voice, which Ursula takes by magically removing the energy from Ariel's vocal chords and storing it in a nautilus shell. Ariel's tail is transformed into legs, leaving her naked except for her seashell bra. Sebastian and Flounder drag her to the surface. Meanwhile, Triton discovers Ariel and Sebastian's disappearance and, wracked with guilt over his behavior, orders a search for them.Eric and Max find Ariel on the beach. He initially suspects that she is the one who saved his life, but when he learns that she cannot speak, he discards that notion, to the frustration of both Ariel and Max (who knows the truth). He helps her to the palace, where the servants think she is a survivor of a shipwreck. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss (""Kiss the Girl"") but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at their narrow escape, Ursula takes the disguise of a beautiful young woman named ""Vanessa"" and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Vanessa/Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel.The next day, Ariel finds out that Eric will be married to the disguised Ursula on a ship. She cries and is left behind when the wedding barge departs. Scuttle discovers that Vanessa is Ursula in disguise, and informs Ariel. As Ariel and Flounder chase the wedding barge, Sebastian informs Triton, and Scuttle is assigned to literally ""stall the wedding."" With the help of various animals, the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck is broken, restoring Ariel's voice and breaking Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel was the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula reverts to her true form and kidnaps Ariel.Triton appears and confronts Ursula, but cannot destroy Ursula's contract with Ariel. Triton chooses to sacrifice himself for his daughter, and is transformed into a polyp. Ursula takes Triton's crown and trident, which was her plan from the beginning. Ursula uses her new power to gloat, transforming into a giant, and forming a whirlpool that disturbs several shipwrecks to the surface, one of which Eric commandeers. Just as Ursula is set to use the trident to destroy Ariel, Eric turns the wheel hard to port and runs Ursula through the abdomen with the ship's splintered bowsprit, mortally wounding her. With her last breaths, Ursula pulls the ship down with her, but Eric escapes to shore in time.With Ursula gone, her power breaks and the polyps in Ursula's garden (including Triton) turn back into the old merpeople. Later, after seeing that Ariel really loves Eric and that Eric also saved him in the process, Triton willingly changes her from a mermaid into a human using his trident. She runs into Eric's arms, and the two finally kiss.In the final scene, an unspecified amount of time later, Ariel marries Eric in a wedding where both humans and merpeople attend."
Driving Miss Daisy,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097239/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An old Jewish woman and her African-American chauffeur in the American South have a relationship that grows and improves over the years. An elderly Jewish widow living in Atlanta can no longer drive. Her son insists she allow him to hire a driver, which in the 1950s meant a black man. She resists any change in her life but, Hoke, the driver is hired by her son. She refuses to allow him to drive her anywhere at first, but Hoke slowly wins her over with his native good graces. The movie is directly taken from a stage play and does show it. It covers over twenty years of the pair's life together as they slowly build a relationship that transcends their differences.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Daisy Werthan, an elderly Jewish widow living in Atlanta, is determined to maintain her independence. However, when she crashes her car, her son, Boolie, arranges for her to have a chauffeur, an African-American driver named Hoke Colburn. Daisy and Hoke's relationship gets off to a rocky start, but they gradually form a close friendship over the years, one that transcends racial prejudices and social conventions.—Jwelch5742 It is about September of 1948. A wealthy, spunky, and independent 72 year old Jewish widow and former grade school teacher named Daisy Werthan accidentally backs her new Chrysler into her neighbors yard after having put her foot on the accelerator too far. The car is totaled and insurance company has declared her high risk. Her 35 year old son Boolie, a successful, third generation textile business owner, insists she hires a chauffeur, but she refuses to do so. For the time being, she either takes care of business herself or have one of her friends give her a ride.Oscar, an employee of Boolie's is stuck in the freight elevator at the textile mill. Hoke Coleburn, about 60 years of age, helps him get the elevator down to the floor. Boolie notices Hoke's resourcefulness, with him being revealed as a potential chauffeur. Boolie seems disinterested, but Hoke follows him to his office and interviews with him. Hoke is given the job after Boolie's questioning of his previous employment, but warns him of his mother's stubbornness and uptightness, but assured she can't fire him.Hoke is brought over to Daisy's house by Boolie. Daisy refuses to be formally introduced to him and doesn't want ""some chauffeur"" staying at her house and eating her food (a subtle hint of racism), despite the fact she's had the same black cook and housekeeper for over 20 years. A brand new 1949 Hudson sits in the garage.Hoke tries to stay busy and earn his pay around Daisy's house, but Daisy refuses to let him touch her things. After 6 days, he informs her of the low supply of coffee, Dutch Cleanser, and silver polish. Daisy insists on taking the streetcar to the Piggly Wiggly. Hoke will not let her do it and follows her. Daisy gives in and lets him give her the lift, but sets him straight on some rules.Afterwards, Hoke takes Daisy to the Reform Jewish temple she regularly attends. When the service is over, he's parked in the front of the church and wants to give her the VIP treatment, but she is embarrassed. He does not understand her modesty despite her wealth and reminds him of her poor upbringing. But she needs a chauffeur and he needs the job and should just leave it at that.A few weeks later on a cold and foggy morning, Daisy notices a can of salmon missing from her pantry. She calls Boolie over about the incident and that Hoke is not someone she can trust because ""they all take things"". Boolie tries to defend him, but she refuses and feels she's being invaded. Hoke and Idella, Daisy's maid, arrive for work soon afterwards. Boolie asks Hoke that they have a talk and he agrees. But before they talk, Hoke tells Daisy he ate a can of her salmon last night because the leftover pork chops were too stiff and that he bought a replacement can for her. The incident is immediately forgotten and it turns out Hoke is a man that can be trusted.It is the summer of 1951. Daisy and Hoke are at the cemetery with Daisy's husband's grave plot being tended. She asks Hoke to place flowers on a Leo Bauer grave and gives him the directions to it. He reveals to her that he can't read. Daisy does not understand this, but reassures him in a rather harsh manner that he can read if he knows his ABC's. She gives him the basics and he finds the grave.Christmas Day 1953. Daisy's daughter in law Florine is having a fit because there is no coconut for ambrosia, despite the lavish and generous potluck for the dinner guests. Her new cook Katie Bell did not write it down, but told her to buy it (another hint of illiteracy common among blacks). Boolie assures her it's okay. Daisy and Hoke are coming over to Boolie's house. Hoke is enjoying the Christmas lights in the neighborhood, but Daisy is somewhat appalled by the crass commercialism of Christmas, plus her overall disdain for her daughter in law's refusal to adhere to Jewish tradition. And by this time, Hoke can read well. Daisy hands him a book on calligraphy to help him practice on his writing, but assures it's not a Christmas present.Summer of 1955, Boolie and Hoke are over at the local Cadillac dealership to purchase a 1956 Cadillac Sedan DeVille for Daisy. Hoke made a deal with the car dealer to purchase Daisy's 1949 Hudson, with Boolie surprised about the purchase from the dealer instead of his mother. But Hoke assures Boolie it's okay and does not want to make car payments to her.A short time later, Daisy is prepared for a long journey to Mobile, Alabama to celebrate her brother Walter's 90th birthday. She's fretting that they will be late despite being well-prepared. Hoke pulls up to help her out, followed by Boolie in a nice black 1956 Cadillac Eldorado. Daisy is appalled that Boolie is leaving early for a convention in New York City, because Florine would rather see the play My Fair Lady before then, instead of attending Walter's birthday.Daisy and Hoke begin a 300+ mile journey, which was a long way to drive before interstate highways. Hoke reveals to her it is the first time he's ever left the state of Georgia. They stop to eat a lunch of sandwiches, deviled eggs, peaches, and Coca Cola on the side of the road near a pond. Daisy tells a story to Hoke about her trip there in 1888 when her brother got married and how timid she was when she saw an ocean for the first time. They are interrupted by two racist cops questioning Hoke's possession of the car. Daisy tells them it's her car, they see her registration and Hoke's driver's license. A stern reminder of how dangerous it was for minorities to travel back then. They move on, Daisy has given Hoke the wrong directions, and has held back their journey for a little while. Hoke tells Daisy he needs to use the bathroom on the side of the road, since coloreds cannot use filling station restrooms, but she refuses to let him do so. Hoke lays his foot down that he needs to go and that he's almost 70 years old and doesn't need to be treated like a nobody or a child. Daisy and Hoke make it to Walter's and celebrate the birthday.It is May of 1963. Hoke is paying a visit to Boolie's textile factory. As her walks through, the old textile weaving machines have been replaced by more efficient Saco-Lowell spool machines with fewer workers needing to tend to them. Hoke reveals a wife of Boolie's cousin is trying to hire him and to ""name his own salary"". Boolie catches on and realizes Hoke is really asking for a raise. He's offered $65 a week, but Hoke asks for $75 and Boolie agrees to it. Hoke is exceptionally pleased and thanks Boolie for it and having been fought for.Soon afterwards, Daisy's longtime cook and housekeeper Idealla dies in her kitchen of a heart attack while shelling peas. She, Hoke, Boolie, and Florine attend the funeral at Idella's Missionary Baptist Church to pay their respects.That night, Daisy is in the kitchen preparing a meal of fried chicken, biscuits, rice, and okra for her and Hoke. Hoke is now helping her out with the household tasks, including setting up a garden, which Daisy previously protested.Sometime in the winter of 1963 or 1964, a rare snow and ice storm is ravaging Atlanta. Daisy's electricity is out in her home, but Hoke comes to work that day anyway and with some coffee from the Krispy Kreme. Her son calls to check on her and surprised at her kind comments about Hoke coming over to help and insults her for it.*About January of 1965, Boolie is awarded Businessman of the Year by the Atlanta Business Council detailing of his grandfather Werthan starting the business on Decatur Rd. and where it is now.*Daisy's car is now a blue 1965 Cadillac Sedan DeVille. She and Hoke have been stuck in traffic. Daisy does not get to go to the Jewish Temple for worship and it's revealed to her the temple was bombed. She does not seem to understand why, but realizes after Hoke tells her a story of a boyhood friend of his whose father was hanged that she is almost as much a victim of racism and prejudice as he is.Boolie pays a visit to Daisy at her home revealing his reluctance to attend the speech of Martin Luther King, despite his admiration for him, because it might hurt his business clientele in the future. He suggests she asks Hoke to go, despite her reluctance.*On January 27, 1965, Daisy attends a speech by Martin Luther King at the Dinkier Plaza Hotel. On the way there, she indirectly offers Hoke to join her, but he is offended at her for doing it at the last minute and that times have not really changed all that much, despite her claim that they are. Instead, she attends the speech alone and Hoke sits in the car listening on the radio. Daisy realizes from the speech that she is probably more guilty of what's happened over the years than the overt racists that have said hateful things and incited violence.It is the fall of 1971. Hoke is now driving Daisy's 1965 Cadillac and her car is now a 1970 Cadillac Fleetwood. By this time, he is in his early 80's and she is 95 years old. He enters her home with his usual morning greeting, but she does not respond at first. Soon afterwards, she comes downstairs still in her nightgown and thinking she's a schoolteacher needing to find graded papers. Suffering from dementia, Hoke calls Boolie to come over to help. After having calmed down and with her mind back in place, Daisy declares Hoke as her best friend and that it's sincere. She takes his hand.Thanksgiving Day, November 22, 1973. Hoke is now about 85 years old. His glasses are very thick. His granddaughter Michelle is dropping him off at Daisy's house, which has just been sold. Boolie is now about 60 years old and driving a 1973 Mercedes. He and Hoke have one last visit to the now empty house. Boolie takes him over to the retirement home Daisy is staying at. By this time, she is 97 years old and using a walker. She barely acknowledges their presence at fist, but later insists Hoke stay with her alone. Mostly small talk, but they are enjoying each others company. Hoke gently feeds her pumpkin pie she has not yet eaten and the screen fades to an old automobile of Daisy's driving away. This is possibly the last time they saw each other.*Boolie's award of 1966 Businessman of the year should have been 1965. The speech given by Martin Luther King was on January 27, 1965 at the Dinker Plaza Hotel, but in this movie, it's 1966, which was an error. Also, the Reformed Jewish Temple was bombed in Atlanta on October 12, 1958, but it happened in this movie in 1966, probably as a preceder to the Martin Luther King speech about racism."
Parenthood,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098067/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four Buckman siblings attempt to raise their children - each in their own different style - and deal with the joys and sorrows that the process brings. Gil Buckman (Steve Martin), a neurotic sales executive, is trying to balance a family in suburban St. Louis and his career. He wants to be an active father, rather than the distant workaholic that his own father was.
When he finds out that his eldest son, Kevin, has emotional problems and in the opinion of the school psychologist needs therapy, and also that his two younger children, daughter Taylor and youngest son Justin, both have minor issues as well, he begins to blame himself and deeply question his abilities as a father. In addition his wife, Karen (Mary Steenburgen), becomes pregnant with their fourth child, which he is unsure he can handle.He is frustrated and fearful that the financial burdens of another child and office politics at work, which include a manager who is blatantly dishonest and manipulative, are turning him into the detached workaholic he despised his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), for being. This comes to a head near the end of the film, when Frank comes to Gil for advice on how to deal with Larry (Tom Hulce), Gil's younger wayward brother, and says bluntly that he is asking Gil's advice because he knows Gil always thought he was a lousy father and because he also knows that Gil is a good father. Gil, who has been humbled by his children's issues and his own issues at work, opens up about his self doubts as a parent. Frank tries to reassure him in a casual way by telling him that he worries too much, and the two have a reconciliation of sorts with Frank telling Gil that worry for one's child never ends.Throughout the movie, Gil tries to lighten up more and be less fearful of the surprises he encounters in life and this has a good effect on Kevin, whose emotional problems begin to recede. When a hired cowboy character fails to show up at their birthday party, Gil dresses as a cowboy himself and assumes the role.His sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is a divorced bank manager and her dentist ex-husband wants nothing to do with their children, Garry and Julie. He has a new wife and young son to whom he is very devoted. At first, Garry (Joaquin Phoenix), who has just entered puberty, appears to be a very disturbed boy. He is quiet, not involved, and likes to be alone in his room with a mysterious paper bag. At first Helen worries that the bag contains drugs or alcohol, but the bag was actually filled with porn that he would masturbate to in his room.Helen's daughter, Julie (Martha Plimpton), is still in high school, but doesn't seem interested in school or her future even though she got 1300 on her SATs. She is already having sex with her slacker boyfriend, Tod Higgins (Keanu Reeves), and the two of them want to start their lives together. They get married, Julie gets pregnant, and the two live at her mother's house. When in desperation Helen asks Tod to talk with Garry, Tod is able to form a strong bond with him by reassuring him that his obsession with girls and sex is not perverted, but normal for a boy his age. This is a tremendous relief to Garry, and he becomes much happier.This also greatly increases Helen's respect for Tod and she forms a strong bond with him too. She is relieved when Tod tells her what was really bothering Garry all along. Tod also mentions that she at least isn't abusive like his father was. Eventually she supports Tod and respects his and her daughter's relationship to the extent that when Julie wants to break up with him because of her fears with his profession (drag racing) Helen orders her to face her fears and support him also, even when he has a racing accident. She ultimately marries Garry's biology teacher who becomes the loving father figure that Garry in particular was so desperate to have.Gil's other sister, Susan (Harley Kozak), is a middle school science teacher married to an intelligent but slightly neurotic scientist husband, Nathan Huffner (Rick Moranis). They have a sweet, precocious daughter, Patty. Susan wants more children, but Nathan is overly obsessed with their daughter's cognitive development and as a result, Patty is unable to relate to other children and Susan is neglected by all the attention that Nathan focuses on Patty, to the point of including Patty on a romantic getaway that Susan planned for just the both of them. Susan lashes out by eating junk food hidden in the closet and by compromising her diaphragm as a plan to get pregnant despite her husband's wishes. She eventually gets so frustrated with the situation that she leaves her family, causing Susan to struggle with her work and Nathan to eventually drop by one of her classes unexpectedly, serenading her in an effort to win her back. He promises Susan he will try to change and will lighten up about Patty, and Susan agrees to move back into their home.Finally there is Larry (Tom Hulce), who, rather than settle into a career, has drifted through life trying to cash in on get-rich-quick schemes. Though he is the black sheep of the family, he is Frank's favorite (mainly because he reminds him of himself at a younger age). He has recently shown up, along with his bi-racial son, Cool (who was the result of a brief affair with a Las Vegas showgirl), and wants to borrow money from his father, supposedly for another of his get-rich-quick schemes. As always, Frank is supportive.But soon it becomes apparent that Larry has a gambling problem and needs the money to pay off his extensive gambling debts, $26,000, or else he must pay with his life. Frank is disillusioned about Larry, but still loves him and tries to help. Frank refuses to bail him out completely, but offers to teach him the family business (plumbing supplies) so he can take it over from Frank (who has to put off retirement) and use the income to pay off the gambling debts. Larry ""adds a wrinkle"" which involves going to Chile, and Frank recognizes that his son will never stop wasting his life. He agrees to look after Cool and when his grandson asks if Larry is coming back, Frank says no, then asks if he'd like to stay with them. It is implied that Larry will disappear, with the irate criminals he owes money to on his tail; he is not seen again.The film ends on a sentimental note with a new generation of Buckman children being born and the personal growth of the parents. Helen has just given birth to a baby girl, which is the reason why the family is reunited at the hospital. Frank lovingly hugs and cuddles his grandson, Cool, demonstrating that he changed his distant ways. Tod and Julie remain together (despite Helen's less than sunny predictions for their chances), raising their son. Nathan has lightened up as a parent. Susan is visibly pregnant. Gil and Karen are now the proud parents of four."
Dead Poets Society,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Maverick teacher John Keating returns in 1959 to the prestigious New England boys' boarding school where he was once a star student, using poetry to embolden his pupils to new heights of self-expression. Painfully shy Todd Anderson has been sent to the school where his popular older brother was valedictorian. His roommate, Neil Perry, although exceedingly bright and popular, is very much under the thumb of his overbearing father. The two, along with their other friends, meet Professor Keating, their new English teacher, who tells them of the Dead Poets Society, and encourages them to go against the status quo. Each does so in his own way, and is changed for life.—Liz Jordan <c9310494@alinga.newcastle.edu.au> A new English teacher, John Keating, is introduced to an all-boys preparatory school that is known for its ancient traditions and high standards.

This semester begins during an orientation gathering with a speech given by the stern Headmaster Nolan (Norman Lloyd), who states the academy's four pillars: Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence. Todd meets Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) a friendly and ambitious student whom becomes his dorm roommate.Later in his dorm, Neil is ordered by his grumpy and domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) to drop his involvement with the school annual in order to maintain good grades so the boy may become a doctor much as he has done. Neil is under pressure from his stern father's will. Also, Mr. Perry tells Neil that Mrs. Perry also wants him to become a doctor, which further worries the boy. A little later, Todd tells Neil that he is in a similar situation with his parents involving his older brother who also attended Welton a few years ago, graduated, and attended Yale Law School and became a lawyer and his parents want the exact same thing for him. But Todd does not have the courage to tell his parents that he instead wants to be a writer, not a lawyer.During the first day of classes Todd and Neil experience the various teaching methods which include speeches by the trig teacher, as well as the Latin teacher, and the chemistry teacher who states that ""all 20 questions at the end of the first chapter are due tomorrow"". In stark contrast to these orthodox teaching methods, the guys see a different side of the school when they attend English class taught by the newly arrived (and liberal-minded) Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), whom they met briefly during the orientation -- Keating tells his class he was also a student at ""Helton"" (as the students secretly refer to the institution) himself many years ago. Keating enters his class smiling and whistling the 1812 Overture, and he first takes the boys out in the hallway to the school's displays cases containing photos and artifacts of the school's sports achievements. He tells them that they all have the potential to become powerful individuals, and they are responsible for what their futures will hold. These two actions show his difference from the other teachers because no other teacher would commit the actions he does. Also, he tells the boys they may call him ""Oh Captain, my Captain"", (the title of a poem by Walt Whitman about Abraham Lincoln) if they dare. These examples of Mr. Keating's teachings show the boys how to think for themselves. Mr. Keating then tells the boys ""Carpe Diem"", which is Latin for ""seize the day"".In addition to Todd and Neil, a small group of other students whom include the lovesick Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), the flip Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), the pragmatic Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), liberal Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero) and the moderate Gerard Pitts (James Waterston), also react to the first day's lesson with comments from ""that was weird"" to ""neat"". Cameron asks if anything Keating told them will be on a future test and the boys respond with mild scorn.The next day Keating starts the class with a traditional teaching approach by having Neil read out loud the introduction to their poetry textbook, which describes how to rate the quality of poetry according to mathematical plotting. Keating finds such mathematical criticism ridiculous and instructs his pupils to rip out the essay which is one of three ways that he demonstrates freedom of expression and non-conformity. When some students hesitate, he tells them ""this is not the Bible. This is a battle, a war. You will have to learn to think for yourselves.""A few days later, Knox Overstreet is asked to attend a dinner party at the Danburry household, friends of his parents. When he arrives, a beautiful girl answers the doorbell and intently captures his attention. Later, he learns that the girl, Christine Noel, is dating Chet Danburry, but does not give up the hope of dating her.One day, Neil finds an old Welton yearbook with Mr. Keating in it. After seeing that Mr. Keating listed ""Dead Poets Society"" as one of his activities at the school, the boys ask Mr. Keating what this was. He replies that the DPS was a secret club dedicated to taking the meaning out of life. To do so, the members would sit in a cave near a certain pond less then a mile from school grounds and recite poetry, philosophically drawing life lessons from it to enhance their lives and appreciation of literature. With this new idea in their head from asking Mr. Keating what the DPS was, Neil and the boys decide to start up the DPS once again.While coming inside after recess, Neil convinces the boys to join the DPS and meet at midnight by the creek to start their first meeting. Todd tells them that he will come along to the meeting as long as he does not have to read any poetry. When they arrive at the cave, the boys hold their first meeting. Knox shows up so that he can build confidence, like learning pretty poetry, to swoon Christine. The boys begin to learn how rhythm and language in poetry can enhance their own learning and life experience.During their next poetry class, Mr. Keating makes the boys stand on his desk to see the world from a different perspective, another way he demonstrates non-conformity and freedom. At the end of class, Mr. Keating orders the boys to write an original poem for homework which will be read aloud during Monday's class. As he leaves the room, Keating singles out Todd and tells him he knows such an assignment frightens him.Keating's unorthodox teaching methods soon circulate quietly among the other teachers who scorn his liberal and idealist methods. During dinner, the Latin teacher tells Keating, ""you are taking a big risk in making your students think they are artists"". Keating replies: ""I'm only trying to make them free thinkers"". The Latin teacher, a reader of the Realist literature movement, rebukes him by saying, ""free thinkers at age seventeen?"", reciting some poetry from a Realist poet to emphasize his point. Keating recites another line ""It is only in their minds that men can truly be free. T'was always thus, and always thus shall be."" When the professor asks him if that passage belongs to a Realist poet, Keating smiles, telling him he'd made it up on the spot.Neil attempts to seize the day by trying out for a part in the play 'A Midsummer Nights Dream' the school is putting on -- such an act is done in full defiance of his father's wishes. Meanwhile, Knox goes to a nearby public high school football game and sees Christine in the arms of Chet, who is a football player at that school.Back in English class, Mr. Keating has the boys kick soccer balls while yelling poetry aloud, the final way that he demonstrates freedom and non-conformity. Then, Neil receives a letter that says he got the part of Puck in the play. Now he must forge a letter of permission to the headmaster and Mr. Perry, along with their signature of approval.The next day in class, Mr. Keating tells Todd to stand up and recite his poem. When Todd tells his teacher that he did not write a poem, Mr. Keating tells the boy to make one up right now on the spur of the moment, taking him to the front of the room. Todd's new poem is about a portrait of Walt Whitman on the wall, and Mr. Keating seems to have an astounding affect on Todd. Todd improvises with Keating's aggressive but kind coaching and he refers to Whitman as the ""snaggly-toothed madman."" The rest of the class, including one of the more cynical students applaud Todd's efforts. By pulling the boy out of his seat in front of the class and create his own poem, Mr. Keating successfully reaches out to Todd and builds his confidence.That night, the boys meet at the cave to hold another DPS meeting, and afterwords Knox gets the courage to phone Christine, who invites him to a party at the Danburry home.The following day, Mr. Keating teaches tells the boys not to conform, and Todd gets the same desk pen set from his parents that they got him last year for his birthday. Neil finds Todd sitting alone and disappointed and boosts his roommate's confidence by telling him that he should take the desk set and throw it to see how aerodynamic it is. Todd's mood is instantly improved.When Knox goes to Christine's party that night, he's asked by several of the local high school's football players to join them in a toast to his brother, a football hero, despite Knox' insistence he's not their guy. Later, he becomes drunk and finds himself sitting next to a mostly unconscious Christine on the couch. He recalls Keating's words ""carpe Diem"" and kisses her, only to be caught by Chet, who punches him out. Though Christine comes to his aid, Knox leaves the party.The day after the DPS meeting, which is also attended by some girls Charlie invited, Dalton writes a joking and anonymous letter on behalf of the DPS to the school asking if girls may be admitted to Welton Academy. Charlie also takes the bold but foolish step of signing the letter from the DPS. During a hastily arranged school meeting which addresses this letter, a phone is heard ringing. Charlie pulls out a hidden phone, answers it and says the call is from ""God"" and that God wants girls to attend Welton. The school's headmaster holds a private meeting with Charlie, demanding to know who is in the DPS. Charlie refuses and the headmaster paddles him harshly. The headmaster later talks to Keating, telling him he is aware of Keating's unorthodox teaching methods and that encouragement of free-thinking among the students is dangerous. Keating later talks to Charlie and the boys, telling the recovering Charlie that ""sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone."" In the newer era of the school, where discipline is much harsher, pranks like Charlie's can have the effect of hurting a student's future rather than making them a school legend.When Neil's father arrives at Welton on an unexpected visit, he scolds Neil for joining the play and orders him to quit. Neil tells Mr. Keating about the incident, and that his father won't allow Neil to act. To this, Mr. Keating suggests that Neil tell his father how the boy truly feels. Neil does, but his bossy and stubborn father continues to refuse to let him partake in the play and tells Neil that he must focus all his energy on studying to become a doctor. A few days later, Neil lies to Mr. Keating and tells him that his father allowed him to continue with the play.When Knox goes to Christine's high school, he embarrasses her in class by giving her flowers and reciting poetry. Christine goes to Welton where she angrily tells Knox that his actions embarrassed her in front of her classmates. Knox apologizes and asks Christine if she would go to Neil's play with him. Christine is again embarrassed, but flattered by the attention Knox displays, accepts his offer as a date.At the theatre, Neil gives a great performance as Puck. As he is about to give Puck's closing monologue, Neil spots his father looking stern and angry from the back but receives a standing ovation. Neil is angrily driven home by his father, who also tells Keating to stay away from his son. While at home, Mr. Perry tells Neil that in retaliation for his defiance, he will pull Neil out of Welton and forcibly enroll him in Braden Military School to prepare him for Harvard University and a career in medicine. Unable to cope with the future that awaits him or make his stern and narrow-minded father understand his emotions, Neil commits suicide by shooting himself with his father's gun.The next day in school, the boys are told of Neil's suicide and in separate meetings, each is questioned about the DPS after Cameron reveals the club's secrets to the headmaster. Dalton is expelled from the Welton Academy when he punches Cameron for betraying them. Cameron's defense of his actions is that they can all save their respective futures at the school if they cooperate, even if they can't keep Keating from being fired.When Todd is called to Nolan's office, where his parents are waiting, Nolan forces Todd to admit to being a member of the Dead Poets Society, and tries to make him sign a document blaming Keating for abusing his authority, inciting the boys to restart the Dead Poets Society, and encouraging Neil to flout his father's authority. Todd sees Richard's, Knox's, Steven's and Gerald's signatures already on the document. At first, Todd refuses to sign, but when Nolan threatens to expel him and his equally stern parents threaten to disown him should he be kicked out of school, the painfully shy Todd does not have the nerve to argue with any of them and signs the paper.Keating is fired from Welton and is forced to leave without any severance pay or letter of recommendation to teach at any other public or private school in the state. Although the other teachers at Welton have disapproved of his teaching methods, most of them are somewhat upset to see the likable and friendly Keating leaveThe next day, Headmaster Nolan arrives at English class where he tells the students that he is their new teacher until a substitute will arrive to replace him. The shy and afraid Todd cannot respond when asked what the boys have done in the class so far, so Nolan asks Cameron. He tells the teacher that the class thoroughly covered poetry, but skipped over Realism. The headmaster tells them they will start over and to read the introduction to their textbook, but it is ripped out, so he gives Cameron the teacher's book to read from. Just then, Mr. Keating enters the room to collect a few of his papers before he leaves. Todd reveals to Keating that he and the other students were intimidated into signing the confession. Keating tells Todd that he already knows. Nolan orders Todd to be quiet and demands that Keating leave, threatening any other student who speaks up with expulsion.As Keating is about to exit the classroom, Todd finally breaks through his cowardice and self-pity and calls out: ""O Captain! My Captain!"" and then stands on top of his desk and faces Keating, giving him a farewell salute. Nolan immediately yells at Todd to sit down or face expulsion. In what is probably the movie's most touching and emotionally powerful scene, one by one, Knox, Steven, Gerard, and all of the members of the Dead Poets Society, except for Cameron and a few other students, climb onto their desks and face Keating to salute their former teacher. Knowing they are too many for the school to expel en masse quietly, they remain standing on their desks despite Nolan's orders for them to sit back down until he gives up and slumps against the teacher's desk, angry and emotionally defeated. Seeing that his work at the school had not been in vain, a visibly touched Keating says: ""Thank you, boys. Thank you."" With Todd and the other the students looking on, Keating then happily leaves the classroom with tears in his eyes, and walks out of the school for good."

Over the next 10 years, they occasionally meet and soon do in fact become fast friends.

Barbara and Oliver Rose live happily as a married couple--until she starts to imagine what life would be like without him, and likes what she sees. Both want to stay in their house, so they begin a campaign to force each other to leave. In the middle of their fighting is D'Amato, the divorce lawyer, who gets to see how far each will go to get rid of the other, and boy, do they go far.—Rob Hartill Levelheaded lawyer Gavin D'Amato has a worried client sitting in his office. This client is going through a divorce, obviously his first. to make sure this quiet unnamed man plays his cards right, Gavin tells him the story of what happened to a colleague and former client: Oliver Rose. Oliver was a fair-game law student who met Barbara, a gymnast who lived for the thrill of the moment. They shared a love for exquisite possessions and married right away. Their differences finally caught with them after 18 years, and they ended up in a bitter divorce battle. But divorce was anything but a solution, as custody of their possessions escalated beyond anyone's, even Gavin's help.—Don Hoffman It's been 17 beautiful, prosperous years full of love and understanding for once-inseparable lovebirds Barbara and Oliver Rose, but now the love is gone, and the embittered couple seem determined to let all those years go down the drain. They desperately want out, except for one little problem: neither Oliver nor Barbara is willing to leave empty-handed. Under those circumstances, the couple is bound for an unnecessary, yet explosive and utterly catastrophic, head-to-head collision, in a no-holds-barred civil war between the sexes with their lavish mansion as the precious spoils of war. Without a doubt, theirs is a sad story, however, is any marriage destined to succeed? After all, Barbara and Oliver's divorce lawyer is deeply skeptical.—Nick Riganas As a cautionary tale, Washingtonm D.C.-based divorce lawyer Gavin D'Amato tells a potential new client the story of the Roses, Oliver and Barbara. The Roses fell in love at first sight when they were both poor college students--he on scholarship at Harvard Law, and she on a gymnastics scholarship at Madison--meeting by chance at an auction when they were both bidding on the same art piece. Through the early part of their marriage, both seemed to be striving for the same thing: prestige and the image of perfection, coming at it from two different directions. Oliver, the breadwinner, did everything he could to impress his bosses to make partner to make more and more money, while Barbara spent that money creating what they both considered the perfect showcase home. The house itself, she had stumbled upon and bought relatively inexpensively on a white lite. the house itself which she stumbled upon and bought relatively inexpensively on a white lie. After ostensibly making the house that perfect home and becoming empty-nesters with their two children going off to college, Barbara realizes that she has lost any sense of herself and largely blames this on Oliver, who is oblivious to her unhappiness--until she asks for a divorce. Both are unwilling to give up the house, the symbol of that prestige and perfection, in the divorce settlement. Both are living in the house during the divorce proceedings, with both their children, when home, and their housekeeper Susan being pawns and potential collateral damage in each doing whatever to get the other to leave and give up the house in the settlement.—Huggo Gavin D'Amato (Danny DeVito), a prominent Washington DC divorce attorney, is in his office discussing a divorce case with a taciturn client (Dan Castellaneta). Noticing the man's determination to divorce his wife, Gavin decides to tell him the story of one of his clients: the Roses.17 Years Earlier.Oliver Rose (Michael Douglas), a student at Harvard Law School, meets Barbara (Kathleen Turner) at an auction on the island of Nantucket, where they bid on the same antique: mistakenly undervalued 18th-century Chinese homunculus statuette. Oliver chats Barbara up and they become friends. When Barbara misses her ferry home, the two end up spending the night together at a local inn. Eventually after a whirlwind romance, the two get married.Three years later, the Roses have a family of boisterous twins, Josh and Carolyn, who distract Oliver from his efforts to complete a Harvard University law degree. One Christmas Eve, Oliver is busy with his studies and doesn't want anyone to distract him, but Barbara insists they go for a walk and surprises her husband with an antique Morgan automobile.Five years later, Barbara and Oliver relocate to Washington DC where Oliver becomes an associate lawyer at a firm with Gavin, and angles for a more prestigious role. Sometime later, Barbara discovers that the owner of her ""dream home"" has died, and the Roses move into the mansion. Over the next six years, Oliver becomes a senior partner while Barbara refurbishes the house. Once the remodeling is complete, Barbara announces her plan to start a small business, selling pâté to fellow housewives. Anticipating a lucrative enterprise, Barbara buys an enormous sport utility (SUV) truck for $25,000. As her business flourishes and the Rose twins prepare to attend Harvard, Oliver persuades his wife to hire a live-in housekeeper named Susan (Marianne Sägebrecht).At first, Oliver and Barbara's marriage is happy and content as both of them share their materialist ways and views of modern American society with purchases of expensive furniture and clothing to show off their wealth. However, cracks seem to be forming in the family, such as the children growing up overweight because the shallow and insecure Barbara thinks that spoiling them with candy treats is positive, and they do not get in shape until their teen years. Soon, Barbara appears to grow tired of her life with Oliver, and at the same time, begins to dislike him and everything he does. As Barbara becomes more cold and distant, Oliver, for his part, cannot understand what he has done to earn Barbara's growing contempt of him. The reason being is that Oliver remains oblivious to his controlling, self-centered, indifferent and generally dismissive behavior toward her.One evening, when Oliver fails to read her catering business contract due to having a get together with some clients at their house, an argument ensues, and Barbara uses her strength as a gymnast to squeeze Oliver's waist between her thighs. At a lunch meeting the following day, Oliver convulses in pain and believes he is dying from a heart attack, but soon learns he has a harmless hernia and attributes it to Barbara's leg grip the previous evening. When Barbara fails to arrive at the hospital, Oliver returns home with a note he scrawled when he thought he was near death, declaring to Barbara: ""All I am and all I have I owe to you."" However, Barbara is unmoved. She later confesses that she felt happy at the prospect of Oliver's death and asks for a divorce. She proves that she is serious when she physically punches Oliver in his face and he immediately agrees to a divorce.Sometime later, the couple meets Barbara's divorce lawyer, Harry Thurmont (G.D. Spradin), who states that Barbara wants nothing from Oliver but the house and all of its contents. Oliver argues that he is legally entitled to half of everything they own. When Oliver insists that his earnings paid for the home, the attorney quotes Oliver's ""deathbed"" note. Enraged, Oliver declares war on his wife and vows she will never get the house. Aware that it might not be wise to represent himself despite being a professional lawyer, Oliver hires Gavin on retainer to be his legal representation.Barbara initially throws Oliver out of the house, but he moves back in when he discovers a legal loophole that allows him to stay in the house while the divorce is pending. Barbara immediately begins plotting to remove Oliver from the picture.On Christmas Eve, the Rose family awkwardly gathers around their decorated tree. When the Christmas tree lights dim, Barbara declares that there is a short circuit and they should unplug the lights, but Oliver typically dismisses Barbara's concern and insists the blackout is due to a misplaced ornament. Later that evening, the tree catches fire and Barbara gleefully gloats over Oliver's error.Oliver contacts Gavin and comes up with several ideas to get Barbara to leave. Oliver meets with Barbara and even goes as far as to offer her all the furniture, antiques, and valuables in the house in exchange for letting him have it as an empty shell, but the greedy Barbara refuses, accepting nothing less than everything. Barbara begins to show signs of a mental breakdown when she shows up at Gavin's office and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce him as a way to make him side with her.On another night, Barbara refuses to share her sleep medications with Oliver, and he accidentally kills her beloved cat on his way to the pharmacy. Taking revenge, Barbara locks Oliver in his basement sauna where he nearly dies from heatstroke. Although she lets him out, hoping he will finally relent and leave the house, Oliver's conviction only grows stronger and he later saws the heels off Barbara's extensive shoe collection in retribution.In another effort to compromise, Oliver offers Barbara a generous sum of cash in exchange for ownership of the house in his name, but Barbara continues to refuse to settle and insists that since she found the house, raised their two children in it, fixed it up and bought all of the furniture, the house belongs to her since she never had anything in her life while growing up or ever had any close family. Barbara states that if she moves out, she will have nothing and nobody in her life to go back to. Oliver, who also never had anything growing up and also does not have any close family, counters that he paid for the house and everything in it with his own money earned from long and hard work years of being a lawyer and that the house belongs to him which is he sees as his proud accomplishment in his life. Oliver also states that if he moves out, he too will have nothing and nobody in his life to go back to either.Gavin never tells Oliver about Barbara's attempt to seduce him... aware that Oliver will not react well to this latest underhanded tactic of hers. But finally realizing that his client is in a no-win situation with his mentally warped wife, Gavin eventually tells Oliver that if the case goes to trial, any judge or jury would rule in Barbara's favor. Gavin advises Oliver to end this ugly conflict by divorcing Barbara, move out of the house for good, and find and re-build a new life for himself with his own fortune. But in response, Oliver fires Gavin and decides to take matters into his own hands, refusing to let Barbara destroy him and his manhood.Over the next few weeks, Oliver and Barbara begin spiting and humiliating each other in every way possible, even in front of friends and potential business clients of Barbara's. Both of them begin destroying the house furnishings; the stove, furniture, Staffordshire ornaments, and plate ware.Some months later, while the kids are away at college, Oliver eventually calms down and attempts to speak with Barbara in a civilized manner over an elegant dinner, but he finally reaches his breaking point when Barbara serves him a paté which she cruelly implies was made from his beloved dog (although the dog is alive and well outside). Oliver angrily attacks Barbara, who flees into the attic to hide. Oliver then boards up the entire house to prevent her from escaping as he now plots to kill her, while she plots the same thing.Just then, Susan sneaks back into the house with concern for the couple and Oliver forces her to go away. Afraid that Oliver and Barbara really might attempt to kill each other, Susan phones Gavin for help and he agrees to come to the house to help.A little later that same night, Oliver drunkenly sings to Barbara and lures her out of hiding with the announcement that he has a ""gift"" for her: the 18th-century Chinese homunculus statuette that Barbara won in the estate auction the day they met. As she reaches for it from the top of the stairs, Oliver pulls a string he attached to the ornament and snatches it away. Referring to the antique that provoked their bidding war years earlier, Oliver declares that he will move out and give Barbara everything in the house if she says: ""It's mine."" Twisting his words, Barbara replies, ""It's mine,"" inferring that the homunculus belongs to her. In response, Oliver smashes the artifact with an iron poker and Barbara bends over in pain, covering her eye. Oliver runs up the stairs to help, but she retaliates, hitting him with the rod. Losing balance, Barbara falls through the banister and clings for life to the foyer's chandelier. Oliver offers to save her in return for the house, but she still refuses to be rescued. When he tries to catch the chandelier with the iron poker, he, too, is trapped on the light fixture. Just then Gavin arrives with Susan and they see from one of the boarded windows Oliver and Barbara hanging onto the chandelier. He attempts to find a ladder from the garage.While they are trapped on the chandelier, Oliver admits to Barbara that despite their hardships, he always loved her, but Barbara does not respond. Gavin manages to get a ladder, but he is forced to use it as a battering ram to knock the locked front door down. Just before Gavin manages to break into the mansion, the chandelier snaps and falls to the floor, and Oliver and Barbara are both fatally wounded. With his final breath, Oliver reaches his hand out to Barbara's shoulder, and Barbara uses her last strength to hit Oliver's hand away, revealing that she truly did not love him anymore and she indeed wanted him dead.Back in the present, Gavin warns his new client that there is no such thing as a ""civil divorce"" and suggests that he try to restore love in his faded relationship. After the nameless and mute client leaves, the attorney then finishes his last cigarette and goes home to his new wife."

As the Griswolds find their perfect tree, Rusty reminds Clark that he forgot to bring a saw.Back home, as Clark gets out his Christmas decorations and begins setting up the tree, he makes an off color joke to his pretentious yuppie neighbor Todd (Nicholas Guest) about where he'd like to put the tree.

It turns out the tree that Clark just brought in is the home of a live squirrel. Chaos ensues. Snots chases the squirrel around the house, destroying lots of objects in the process. A frustrated Clark informs the family that no one is walking out on Christmas despite the fact that it has become a total disaster. He then takes the chain saw to the staircase and fixes the null post.

Scott Turner has 3 days left in the local police department before he moves to a bigger city to get some ""real"" cases, not just misdemeanors. Then Amos Reed is murdered, and Scott Turner sets himself on the case. The closest thing to a witness in the case is Amos Reed's dog, Hooch, which Scott Turner has to take care of if it's going to avoid being ""put to sleep"".—Lars J. Aas <larsa@colargol.edb.tih.no> In the peaceful, port town of Cypress Beach, California, a compulsively neat and organized police investigator named Scott Turner (Tom Hanks) trains his replacement, David Sutton (Reginald Veljohnson), before his transfer to the Sacramento Police Department, where Turner hopes he will have more exciting work. At the pier, Turner introduces Sutton to seafood plant owner Walter Boyett (J.C. Quinn) and, across the dock, Turner visits his friend Amos Reed (John McIntire), a shipyard junk collector. Although Turner approaches the old man's houseboat with trepidation, Amos's imposing Dogue de Bordeaux, Hooch, pins Turner down by the throat. Amos claims that Hooch has affection for Turner, then complains of suspicious activity at Boyett's plant.As Turner and Sutton drive away, they are called to Pinecone Beach, where siblings Mike and Christine Harper have discovered over $8,000 washed ashore in a plastic bag. Confiscating the money, Turner tells the children's mother, Mrs. Kathy Harper (Sharon Madden), that the cash will belong to them if no one claims it, but they must use it for college.That night, back at the pier, Boyett orders his henchman, Zack Gregory (Scott Paulin), to kill a worker named Ferraday who stole a plastic bag filled with cash. Hearing Hooch's barks from across the dock, Boyett sends Gregory to Amos's houseboat, but when the old man refuses Gregory's bribe to keep quiet, he is stabbed to death. However, Hooch witnesses the killing, jumps through a window and chases Gregory away.Early the next morning, Turner rushes to the scene of his first murder investigation and is saddened by the death of Amos. As Hooch barks from inside the houseboat where he has been confined, federal agents Harley McCabe (Ebbe Roe Smith) and Jeff Foster (Kevin Scannell) attempt to muscle Turner off the case, but Turner convinces his boss, Chief Howard Hyde (Craig T. Nelson), to let him stay on the job an extra week so he and Sutton can find Amos's killer.When animal control officers claim Hooch is rabid and threaten to shoot him, Turner says the dog is a witness and escorts him to the town's new veterinarian, Emily Carson (Mare Winningham). Learning about the murder, Emily encourages Turner to take the dog home and use him to find the killer.The next day at the station, Turner reviews Amos's autopsy report and determines by the exactness of the stab wound that the murderer was trained in the military. Chief Hyde complains that the investigation is too costly. Later, as Turner shops for dog food, Hooch wrecks his house. When Turner returns to find his order upturned, he goes after Hooch with a gun.

Born on the Fourth of July,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096969/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The biography ofRon Kovic. Paralyzed in the Vietnam war, he becomes an anti-war and pro-human rights political activist after feeling betrayed by the country for which he fought. Based on the true story of Ron Kovic (Cruise, in an Oscar-nominated performance), an idealistic young American proudly enlists during the Vietnam War and returns home a paraplegic. Struggling to overcome drug-addiction and depression, he turns his life around and becomes an outspoken critic of the war. The film opens when Ron Kovic is a young boy living in Massapequa, Long Island, New York. He grows up in a patriotic and Catholic household, instilling within him a strong sense of pride in his country and his religion. As a teenager, and a top member of his high school's wrestling team, he proves himself physically fit and athletic, as well as an academically exceptional student. When local Marine recruiting NCOs visit his school and give Ron and his fellow seniors an impassioned lecture about the Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom, because he is unable to get a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.The story then jumps to Kovic's second Vietnam tour in October 1967. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a number of Vietnamese villagers, believing them to be enemy combatants. After they encounter enemy fire, they escape the village and abandon its sole survivor, a crying baby. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, Wilson, who ends up in the line of fire between sides. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsman present who try to save him, Wilson dies from his wounds. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer (XO), who harshly tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his executive officer.The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol on January 20, 1968. During a firefight, Kovic is critically wounded, shot first through the ankle and then through the chest, smashing his spine. He lays trapped in a field facing certain death, until a fellow Marine rescues him. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down, he spends several months recovering at the Bronx Veterans Administration hospital. The living conditions in the hospital are deplorable; rats crawl freely on the floors, the staff is generally apathetic to their patients' needs, female nurses sell sexual favors to some of the patients, doctors visit the patients infrequently, drug use is rampant, and equipment is too old and ill-maintained to be useful. He desperately tries to walk again with the use of crutches and braces, despite repeated warnings from his doctors. However, he soon suffers a bad fall that causes a compound fracture of his femur. The injury nearly robs him of his leg and puts Ron in traction for several months, and he vehemently argues with the staff and the doctors who consider resorting to amputation.Ron returns home, permanently in a wheelchair, with his leg intact. At home, he begins to alienate his family and friends, complaining about hippies, students and other young adults staging anti-war rallies across the country and burning the American flag. Though he tries to maintain his dignity as a Marine, Ron gradually begins to become disillusioned, feeling that his government has forgotten and even betrayed him and his fellow Vietnam veterans. In Ron's absence, his younger brother Tommy has already become staunchly anti-war, leading to a rift between them. His highly religious mother also seems unable to deal with Ron's new attitude as a resentful, paralyzed veteran. His problems are as much psychological as they are physical, and he quickly becomes alcoholic and belligerent. During an Independence Day parade, he shows signs of post-traumatic stress when firecrackers explode and when a baby in the crowd starts crying, it reminds him of the village he and his unit massacred, and he is unable to finish his speech. He reunites with his old high school friend, Timmy Burns, who is also a wounded veteran, and the two spend Ron's birthday sharing war stories.Ron goes to visit Donna at her college in Syracuse, New York. The two reminisce and she asks him to attend a vigil for the victims of the Kent State shootings. However, he cannot do so, because his chair prevents him from getting very far on campus because of curbs and stairways. He and Donna are separated after she and her fellow students are arrested by the police at her college for demonstrating against the Vietnam War.Ron's disillusionment grows severe enough that he has an intense fight with his mother after returning home drunk one night after having a barroom confrontation with a World War II veteran that fought on Iwo Jima who expressed no sympathy to Ron, who himself had been acting obnoxiously in the bar. After venting his rage at his mother's embarrassment over having a disabled son, he has an emotional conversation with his father and he later leaves home, traveling to a small town in Mexico (""The Village of the Sun"") that seems to be a haven for paralyzed Vietnam veterans. He has his first sexual experience with a prostitute he believes he's in love with. Ron wants to ask her to marry him but when he sees her with another customer, the realization of real love versus a mere physical sexual experience sets in, and he decides against it. Hooking up with another wheelchair-bound veteran, Charlie, who is furious over a prostitute mocking his lack of sexual function due to his severe wounding in Vietnam, the two travel to what they believe will be a friendlier village. After annoying their taxicab driver, they end up stranded on the side of the road. They quarrel and fight, spilling each other out of their wheelchairs. Eventually, they are picked up by a man with a truck and driven back to the ""Village of the Sun"".On his way back to Long Island, Ron travels to Armstrong, Texas where he discovers the tombstone of Wilson, the Marine he believes that he killed during his tour. He then makes a side trek to Georgia to visit the parents and family of the deceased Marine. He tells them the real story about how their son died and confesses his guilt to them. Wilson's widow, now the mother of the deceased Marine's toddler son, admits that she cannot find it in her heart to forgive Ron for killing her husband, but God just might. However, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are more forgiving and even more sympathetic to his predicament and suffering, because Wilson's father fought in the Pacific Theater during World War II and is even disillusioned with the Vietnam War. In spite of the mixed reactions he receives, the confession seems to lift a heavy weight from Ron's conscience.Ron joins Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) and travels to the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami. He and his compatriots force their way into the convention hall during Richard Nixon's acceptance speech and cause a commotion that gets brief coverage on the national news. Ron himself tells a reporter about his negative experiences in Vietnam and the horrific VA hospital conditions. His interview is cut short when guards eject him and his fellow veterans from the hall and attempt to turn them over to the police. They manage to break free from the police, regroup, and charge the hall again, though not so successfully this time. The film ends with Kovic speaking at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, shortly after the publication of his autobiography. He tells the reporters who interview him that he feels he's home and that they all have come home."

Another he believes has to do with it is Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham, who played only one half of one inning of one major league game in 1922 and died in 1972. Ray's voice led path may be difficult to achieve since cynical Mann may not have the same direction of the voice as him and Graham is dead. He will have to work through these puzzles to understand the full meaning of what the voice wants for him, which may not happen if he and Annie lose the farm and thus the baseball field, a real possibility due to the latter taking away from earning income from the farm, especially as Annie's cutthroat brother, Mark, who says he is looking out for her best interest, will do whatever needed to get Ray back to what he considers reality of earning a living from the farm.—Huggo Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) is a novice farmer who lives in rural Iowa with his wife, Annie (Amy Madigan), and their young daughter Karin (Gaby Hoffmann). Ray's deceased father, John Kinsella (Dwier Brown) loved baseball, the Chicago White Sox, and Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), who was banned from baseball for his part in throwing the 1919 World Series during the so-called 1919 Black Sox scandal. His father, though, seemed ""worn down"" by life.While walking through the cornfield, Ray hears a voice whisper, ""If you build it, he will come."" He imagines a baseball field in his cornfield. Annie is skeptical but she tells him to follow his vision. He works on the field for the next couple of days, hoping to find out what will happen. Neighbors stop along the road to watch and heckle as he plows under the corn. He waits all year to see whatever happens. Nothing happens, leaving a dejected Ray. One night the next summer, several deceased ballplayers from the 1919 team begin practicing and playing on the field. Soon after, Ray is told by his brother-in-law that unless he gets rid of the baseball field and returns it to farmland, he will go bankrupt.Ray hears the voice again, which prompts him to contact 1960s author Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), who had once written about the golden days of baseball. He wrote that as a child he dreamed of playing for the Dodgers on Ebbets Field. He goes to Boston to find Terence and bring him to a Red Sox game, which he envisioned in a dream one night. At the game, Ray sees a message on the scoreboard telling him to find a 1920s ballplayer named Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham.Ray and Terence travel to Chisholm, Minnesota, Moonlight's hometown, to find him. The first place they check is the office of the local paper, but one of the researchers there tells them that Moonlight Graham been dead since 1972. A confused Terence and Ray return to their motel room, wondering how to find Moonlight. Ray decides to go out for a walk. During the walk, he discovers that he has somehow been magically transported back in time to 1972. He quickly finds the elderly Moonlight Graham (Burt Lancaster) in the streets, who has been working as a doctor since his brief time in the major leagues. In Graham's office, when Ray asks why he left baseball for medicine, Graham answers that he'd rather save lives as a medical doctor than scrounge through the minor leagues again. He declines Ray's invitation to fulfill his dream.When Ray comes back to the real world the next morning, he and Terence return to Iowa. On their way, they pick up a young hitchhiker. After a brief discussion of how the man is trying to find a way to play professional baseball, the young man introduces himself as Archie Graham (Frank Whaley) - the young Moonlight. The three return to the farm, where Moonlight begins to play with the other ghosts. More baseball players have appeared in Ray's absence, and Moonlight is having a great time playing, while also being razzed by the veteran players about his youth and enthusiasm.During an argument between Ray and his brother-in-law, who is forcing him to lease the property before it's too late, Karin falls off the bleachers. Karin appears to be not breathing. Moonlight quickly runs to help, but hesitates to leave the baseball field. He does step off the field, instantly becoming the old doctor Ray met in Chisholm. Graham recognizes that Karin is choking, and holding her steady and pounding her on the upper back, causing her to cough up the piece of hot dog that had blocked her airway. Ray realizes that Graham's decision means he cannot return to the field as his younger self, and apologizes to the doctor. Moonlight assures Ray that it's alright, and thanks him for his chance. He walks out into the ballfield toward the cornfield, the players now addressing Graham with subdued, respectful voices. Terence and Karin persuade Ray's brother-in-law that tourists will pay admission to see the magic of this field to bring back memories of the game.At the end of the day, the players head for the cornstalks in the outfield. Just before vanishing, Shoeless Joe asks Terence if he will come with them. An angry Ray demands to know why he can't go. Terence persuades him that he has to stay behind to take care of his family. After saying goodbye, Terence walks into the cornstalks and disappears.Shoeless Joe then tells Ray, ""If you build it, HE will come"", and glances toward a player near home plate in catcher's equipment. The player removes his mask, and Ray recognizes his father, John, as a young man. At his wife's urging, Ray introduces John to his granddaughter, Karin, catching himself before telling Karin who he is, and simply introducing him as ""John"". As his father is heading toward the outfield, to leave with the rest of the players, Ray asks his father to play catch, finally calling him ""Dad"", as father and son choke back tears. As they play catch, a long line of cars begin approaching the baseball field - people coming to watch the game... thus fulfilling Karin and Terrence's prophecy that people will come to watch baseball."
Tango & Cash,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098439/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Framed by their ruthless arch-nemesis, a pair of mismatched LAPD officers must put their differences aside to get even with the brutal crime baron who sent them to rot in a maximum-security prison. Intense professional rivalry prolongs the instinctive antipathy between the impeccably dressed BHPD Lieutenant Ray Tango and his impulsive polar opposite, LAPD Lieutenant Gabe Cash. And as they get in each other's way, Yves Perret, a ruthless international drug lord, plans his next move. But instead of bringing down their arch-nemesis, falsified evidence condemns the crime fighters to rot in a maximum-security prison. As their former enemies, hardened criminals incarcerated by them, ache to get their sweet revenge on their captors, Tango and Cash must put their differences aside to survive imprisonment and clear their names. But good plans are hard to come by. Can the mismatched partners learn how to work together and get even with the brutal crime baron?—Nick Riganas Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash are narcotics detectives who, while both being extremely successful, can't stand each other. Crime Lord Yves Perret, furious at the loss of income that Tango and Cash have caused him, frames the two for murder. Caught with the murder weapon at the scene of the crime, the two have no alibi. Thrown into prison with most of the criminals they helped convict, it appears that they are going to have to trust each other if they are to clear their names and catch the evil Perret.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> The film begins as Tango (Sylvester Stallone) drives a late-model Cadillac convertible in pursuit of a tanker truck. His hair is neatly styled, and he is dressed in a three-piece suit. He cleverly stops the truck, and when the LA County authorities find only gasoline in the tank, he shoots the tank and cocaine pours out of the bullet hole. Meanwhile, Cash (Kurt Russell) arrives at his apartment driving an old Corvette. His hair is long and shaggy, and he is dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and a waist-length jacket. He is shot by an intruder, but is protected by a bullet-proof vest, and captures the shooter in a parking garage after a car chase. At the police station, Cash forces the shooter to tell him about a deal scheduled to take place that night.However, the ""deal"" is really a plan by Perret to frame Tango and Cash for murder. Tango and Cash separately go to an empty building, preceded by a man who is revealed later in the film to be Requin (Brion James), Perret's lead henchman. After surprising each other, the two detectives find a dead man with audio equipment hidden under his clothing, and a team of FBI agents swarms in. Wyler, the agent in charge, finds Cash's pistol on the floor and arrests both Cash and Tango.At their murder trial, the detectives are incriminated by an audio tape, secretly given to Wyler by Requin and verified in court by an audio expert, which appears to reveal them shooting the FBI agent after discussing a drug purchase. They plead ""no contest"" to a lesser charge in exchange for reduced sentences in a minimum-security prison, but are transported to a maximum-security prison to be housed with many of the criminals they arrested in the past.Once in prison, Tango and Cash are rousted from their bunks and tortured by Perret, Requin, and a gang of prisoners until Matt Sokowski, the assistant warden, rescues them. Sokowski recommends that they escape, and provides them with a plan, but Tango refuses to go along with it. When Cash tries to escape, he finds Sokowski murdered and is attacked by prisoners. Tango rescues him, and the two of them escape. Once outside the prison walls, Tango tells Cash to ask for his sister Katherine (Hatcher) at a dance club if he needs to contact him later, and they go separate ways.The detectives then visit the witnesses who framed them in court. Wyler admits to Tango that Requin was in charge of the setup, and Cash discovers that the audio expert made the incriminating tape himself. Cash finds Katherine at the dance club, working as an exotic dancer. Later that night, Tango and Cash are met at Katherine's house by Tango's commanding officer, who gives them Requin's address and tells them they have 24 hours to find out who Requin works for. Tango and Cash apprehend Requin and trick him into telling them Perret's name. Armed with a high-tech assault vehicle, they drive to Perret's headquarters, crash through the outer fence, destroy a fleet of armed trucks, hijack two heavy vehicles, crash into the main building, and kill several guards.At this point, Perret, who has kidnapped Katherine, starts a timer that will trigger the building's automatic self-destruct procedure. After killing Perret's core security personnel, Tango and Cash are confronted by Requin, who is holding Katherine at knife point but throws her aside to fight the detectives hand-to-hand with the help of another henchman. The detectives defeat the two criminals, and when Perret appears, holding a gun to Katherine's head, they kill him and leave with Katherine just before the building explodes. Afterward, they joke half-seriously about Cash's desire to date Katherine. The film ends with a newspaper headline celebrating their vindication."
Harlem Nights,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097481/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the 1930s, a New York City illegal gambling house owner and his associates must deal with strong competition, gangsters, and corrupt cops in order to stay in business. ""Sugar"" Ray is the owner of an illegal casino, who contends with the pressures of vicious gangsters and corrupt policemen who want to see him go out of business. In the world of organized crime and police corruption in the 1930s, any dastardly trick is fair. In 1918 Harlem, New York City, African-American ""Sugar Ray"" Raymond (Richard Pryor) plays craps in a backroom at his saloon. A young boy (Dezi Arnez Hines II) delivers cigarettes to the club owner just as a toothless gambler ""craps out"" in a dice game and threatens to stab everyone in the room. The errand boy surprises Sugar Ray by shooting the toothless gambler in the head. Learning that the boy is an orphan, Ray offers to take him in.Twenty years later in the year 1938, Ray's establishment has grown into the thriving Club Sugar Ray's. The former errand boy, now known as ""Quick,"" (Eddie Murphy) has become Ray's right-hand man and de facto son. One night, a gangster named Tommy Smalls (Tommy Ford) arrives at the club with a beautiful Creole woman named Dominique La Rue (Jasmine Guy). Ray recognizes Smalls as the manager of the rival Pitty Pat Club, run by white gangster Bugsy Calhoune (Michael Lerner). Ray notices Quick admiring Dominique from afar, and warns him that she is Calhoune's mistress. Baffled that such a beautiful woman would be involved with a fat, ugly gangster like Calhoune, Quick introduces himself to the woman as a suspicious Ray offers Smalls one of his best tables.Later, Calhoune learns that business is down at the Pitty Pat Club, while Ray's business, according to Dominique and Smalls, is pulling in an estimated $10-15 thousand per week. Hoping to get rid of Ray's club, Calhoune enlists Sergeant Phil Cantone (Danny Aiello), a corrupt policeman, to pay Ray a visit.Counting their profits at the end of the night, Ray's staff awaits Vera Walker (Della Reese), the overweight madam who runs the club's brothel. Vera delivers only $200, and Quick accuses her of stealing. Vera challenges Quick to a fistfight and he laughingly obliges. Following her outside, Quick is humiliated when Vera overpowers him. He retaliates by hitting her with a trash can lid, and she pulls a straight razor. Quick draws his gun and shoots Vera's pinkie toe. As the madam is carried away in an ambulance, Ray urges his protégé to stop overreacting.That night, Ray finds Sgt. Cantone in his living room, but, when pressed, denies that he owns Club Sugar Ray's, insisting he operates a candy shop. Assuming that Calhoune sent the policeman, Ray warns Quick that they will have to relocate if the gangster wants to run them out of business, but Quick resists the idea. Later, Quick shows Ray a telegram from Dominique, who has invited him to dinner, and insists she is romantically interested in him. Ray remains suspicious of Calhoune's crew, however, and is vindicated when Sgt. Cantone arrives and admits his association with the mobster. Cantone threatens that if Ray does not pay him $10,000 per week, he will shut down the club. Ray asks for time to think about the offer.After Cantone leaves, Ray develops a plan to rob Calhoune, take vengeance against Cantone, and leave town. The scheme involves robbing Calhoune's ""pick-up man"" on the night of an upcoming boxing match between African-American fighter, Jack ""Champ"" Jenkins, and Michael Kirkpatrick, an inferior white boxer whose odds are very low. Ray also plans to bet $200,000 on Kirkpatrick in order to deceive Calhoune into thinking Jenkins will throw the fight, leading him to bet on Kirkpatrick and shift the odds. Later, Sgt. Cantone ambushes Tommy Smalls at his apartment, accuses him of stealing from Calhoune, and kills him.Shortly after, Quick pays Smalls a visit to find out more about Calhoune, but finds the gangster dead. As he leaves the building, he is spotted by a group of Smalls's cohorts. Arriving at a restaurant to meet Dominique, Quick is surprised to find Calhoune and his assistant, Joe Leoni, at their table. Calhoune asks Quick to work for him, but Quick refuses, and leaves the restaurant. He is followed by Smalls's cohorts, who believe him to be Smalls's killer. Quick runs the men off the road, then dives out of his moving car and through a shop window. His pursuers fire several rounds of ammunition at him, but Quick shoots all three of them dead. When he returns to Ray's club, Quick receives a call from Dominique and goes to her house, where she seduces him, and encourages him to reveal his real name, Vernest Brown. After they make love, Dominique attempts to kill him, but Quick outwits her and shoots her dead.Quick takes refuge at Ray's home and recounts the night's events. Ray tells Quick that Calhoune will try to assassinate him again, once he learns of Dominique's death. Quick agrees to hide out until their heist the following night. Shortly after, Sgt. Cantone raids Ray's club and Calhoune's men burn it down. Meanwhile, Vera's best prostitute, Sunshine, seduces Calhoune's pick-up man, Richie Vento (Vic Polizos), and confesses that she is a pick-up girl for a local numbers racket. She convinces Vento to give her a ride during the boxing match, just after he is scheduled to pick up the cash amassed by Calhoune's bookkeepers. As planned, Vento makes the pickup while the fight is in progress, then picks up Sunshine on a street corner.At the same time, a couple of Ray's employees retaliate against Calhoune by blowing up the Pitty Pat Club. Cantone spies on Vento as he throws Sunshine's bag of ""cash"" in the trunk next to his, then witnesses as Vento gets into an automobile accident with Ray's nearly-blind croupier, Bennie Wilson (Redd Foxx), and Vera. Dressed as policemen, Ray and Quick intervene, identifying Sunshine as ""Lady Heroin,"" a notorious drug dealer. They arrest Sunshine and Vento, and seize the bag of money from Vento's trunk, claiming it is Sunshine's bag of heroin, as two white policemen arrive on the scene. Vento tells the white officers he knows Sgt. Cantone, and they release him, taking the bag from Ray. Cantone follows Ray and Quick to a deserted bank building and teases them about their failed plan to steal from Calhoune. Just as he points his gun at the two, the rest of Ray's crew appears, holding the corrupt policeman at gunpoint. Tying Sgt. Cantone to a chair, they leave him to suffocate in the vault.At the same time, Vento delivers the money to Calhoune, but instead discovers Sunshine's ""heroin"" inside the bag. Calhoune tests the powder and angrily announces it is sugar. Vera shows up, promising she had nothing to do with Ray's scheme, and begs for protection. She reveals that Ray and Quick are back at Ray's house, and Calhoune goes there with his men. Inside, they find Sgt. Cantone's badge and realize they have been set up just as the place explodes.At a motel in Hoboken, New Jersey, Ray and Quick pay the white men who posed as policemen, and gaze at the New York skyline one last time before leaving town with Annie, Vera, Bennie, and Calhoune's bag of cash."

The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems.The crew wait out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. Lindsey takes a walk in a deep dive suit to examine the wreckage of the rig and encounters 2 of the strange lights, one little one and another big one. She later calls a ""non-terrestrial intelligence"" or ""NTI"". She is able to touch them and when she tries to photograph them, they disappear into the trench from where they came. As usual, the power went off when the NTI were around. Lindsey shares with the crew what she saw, it was a machine, but alive.
Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome, the crew spies on him through a remote operated vehicle, finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. Lindsey is furious at Coffey, but he refuses to back down. He starts spying on Lindsey and overhears her conversation with Hippy who has developed a deep ocean mini sub Pinky, with a camera. Lindsey wants to use the Pinky to search the bottom of the trench of the life forms she encountered outside Deep Core.As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water that is exploring the rig. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Coffey thinks the NTI went straight for the warhead and treats this as a Pre-Emptive attack. Since surface communications are not working, he decides to launch the warhead into the trench tied to Pinky (which Hippy had Pre-Programmed to go right to the trench). To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey (Coffey had blocked all passages to the launch chamber, but Bud swam outside the platform to access the chamber from outside) but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead; Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both (Lindsey and Coffey deliberately run into each other multiple times).Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge, crushing him when it implodes. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her after a prolonged struggle.One SEAL, Ensign Monk (Adam Nelson), helps Bud use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. Monk guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains he knew it was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to an alien city deep in the trench. Inside the city, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. when Bud is taken to the alien ship, they start by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive mega-tsunamis that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. Bud asks why they spared the humans and they show Bud his message to Lindsey.On Deep Core the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench bring the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with Deep Core and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of Deep Core exit the platform, surprised they are not suffering from decompression sickness. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship and Lindsey races to hug him."
Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098382/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Captain Kirk and his crew must deal with Mr. Spock's long-lost half-brother who hijacks the Enterprise for an obsessive search for God at the center of the galaxy. When the newly-christened starship Enterprise's shakedown cruise goes poorly, Captain Kirk and crew put her into Spacedock for repairs. But an urgent mission interrupts their Earth-bound shore leave. A renegade Vulcan named Sybok has taken three ambassadors hostage on Nimbus III, the Planet of Galactic Peace. This event also attracts the attention of a Klingon captain who wants to make a name for himself and sets out to pursue the Enterprise. Sybok's ragtag army captures the Enterprise and takes her on a journey to the center of the galaxy in search of the Supreme Being.—David Thiel <d-thiel@uiuc.edu> It is the 23rd Century and vacationing Captain Kirk faces two challenges: climbing Yosemite's El Capitan and teaching campfire songs to Spock. But vacations are cut short when a renegade Vulcan with a startling secret hijacks the Enterprise in order to find a mythical planet. Kirk and his crew set out to stop this madman in an adventure that takes them to the center of the universe and, perhaps, before the face of God. With the crew under Vulcan control, the captain must rely on an unlikely alliance to save the galaxy. Meanwhile, a Klingon captain wants to make a name for himself and sets out to pursue the Enterprise and intercept Kirk.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> The crew of the newly commissioned USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A) are enjoying shore leave after the star ship's shakedown cruise goes poorly. At Yosemite National Park James T. Kirk (William Shatner), recently demoted back to Captain after the events of the previous two films, is camping with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley). Their leave is interrupted when the Enterprise is ordered by Starfleet Command to rescue human, Klingon, and Romulan hostages on the planet Nimbus III. Learning of the Enterprise's mission, the Klingon Captain Klaa decides to pursue Kirk for personal glory.
Other officers include Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Medical officer, Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) engineer, helmsman Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols)Enterprise reaches Nimbus III, but its transporter beams are inactive, and the Klingon vessel is just 2 hours away and is approaching rapidly. Kirk decides to take a team to the surface to negotiate. Kirk and his landing party attack the hostage location, but the hostages instead take Kirk as captive & force Kirk's team to surrender.On Nimbus III, the Enterprise crew discovers that renegade Vulcan Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill), Spock's half-brother, is behind the hostage crisis. Sybok reveals the hostage situation was a ruse to lure a star ship to Nimbus III. Sybok wants to use a ship to reach the mythical planet Sha Ka Ree, the place where creation began; the planet lies behind a seemingly impenetrable barrier near the center of the galaxy. Sybok uses his unique ability to reveal and heal the innermost pain of a person through the mind meld to subvert the wills of the hostages and crew members. Only Spock (Spock's greatest fear was his father's nonacceptance of Spock as a Vulcan) and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain is what makes him human. For example McCoy''s greatest fear was that McCoy assisted his father in medical euthanasia, and could not save him, despite all the knowledge he had at his disposal. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate the Enterprise to Sha Ka Ree.
As Sybok, Kirk and rest of the crew get near the Enterprise, Klaa's vessel reaches Nimus III as well. Kirk pleads Sybok to assume command so he can guide the enterprise out of this. Kirk instructs Scotty to lower shields just long enough for Sulu to fly the shuttle into the Enterprise manually at full speed. As soon as the shuttle is in, Chekov takes it to warp speed, before Klaa's ship can fire upon its position.The Enterprise successfully breaches the barrier, pursued by Klaa's vessel, and discovers a lone blue planet. Sybok, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy journey to the surface, where Sybok calls out to his perceived vision of God. An entity appears, and when told of how Sybok breached the barrier, demands that the star ship be brought closer to the planet. When a skeptical Kirk inquires, ""What does God need with a star ship?"", the entity attacks him in retribution. The others doubt a god who would inflict harm on people for pleasure.
Meanwhile, unnoticed in the commotion, Klaa's spaceship also penetrates the barrier and cloaks itself and starts to monitor the situation.Realizing his foolishness, Sybok sacrifices himself in an effort to combat the creature and allow the others to escape. Intent on stopping the being, Kirk orders the Enterprise to fire a photon torpedo at their location, to little effect. Spock and McCoy are beamed back to the ship, but Klaa's vessel attacks the Enterprise before Kirk can be transported aboard. The vengeful entity reappears and tries to kill Kirk when Klaa's vessel destroys it in a hail of fire (Spock and the Klingon General Korrd force Klaa to stand down).
Kirk is beamed aboard the Klingon ship. The Enterprise and Klingon crews celebrate a new detente, and Kirk, Spock, and McCoy resume their vacation at Yosemite."
Major League,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097815/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The new owner of the Cleveland Indians puts together a purposely horrible team so they'll lose and she can move the team. But when the plot is uncovered, they start winning just to spite her. Rachel Phelps is the new owner of the Cleveland Indians baseball team. However, her plans for the team are rather nefarious. She wants to move the team to Miami for the warmer climate and a new stadium. To justify the move, the team has to lose, and lose badly. So she assembles the worst possible team she can. Among these are a past-his-prime catcher with bad knees, a shrewd but past-his-prime pitcher, a young tearaway pitcher (and felon) with a 100 mph fastball but absolutely no control, a third baseman who is too wealthy and precious to dive, a voodoo-loving slugger who can't hit a curve ball and an energetic-but-naive lead off hitter and base-stealer who can't keep the ball on the ground. Against the odds, and after the inevitable initial failures, they iron out some of their faults and start to win, much to Ms Phelps' consternation.—grantss An exotic dancer marries the owner of a baseball club. He does not survive the honeymoon and she is in control of his ball club. she wants to move to warmer climes where some new stadiums have been built, but her lease has only one escape clause, poor attendance. She fields the worst team she can find. The attitude of the owner gives the misfits and losers something to rally around and they fight back.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The Cleveland Indians have gone 34 years without a division title. Team owner Donald Phelps has died, and his snobby wife Rachel Phelps, a former showgirl, has taken over as the new owner. Some in the media think Rachel shouldn't be the owner of a baseball team. Rachel hates Cleveland, so she makes plans to move the Indians to the warmer climate of Miami, Florida, but she can't break the team's lease with Cleveland unless the team's attendance for the season is below 800,000. Rachel's plan is to put together a team so awful that the season attendance will be lower than 800,000. Rachel and general manager Charlie Donovan hire a manager for the Indians Lou Brown, who has been the manager of the minor league Toledo Mud Hens for the past 30 years. Charlie then recruits some misfit players catcher Jake Taylor, who is a major league standout with knee problems, Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn, who is a pitcher who throws wildly, third baseman Roger Dorn, who is a product endorser and former major league star who will do anything to avoid injury, outfielder Willie Mays Hayes, who runs fast enough to steal a lot of bases but can't hit very well, and Pedro Cerrano, who is an outfielder who practices voodoo. As expected, the Indians get off to a slow start, but when they discover that Rachel wants the team to lose so she can move the team, the Indians get their act together and start winning games and raising their attendance, as Jake tries to win back his ex-girlfriend Lynn Wells, and the Indians do what they can to win the division title.—Todd Baldridge The new owner of the Cleveland Indians threatens to move the team unless they deliver immediate results. She then fills the roster with has-beens and never-will-bes to guarantee their failure. But the team miraculously rallies together and starts to win.—jgp3553@yahoo.com Rachel Phelps, a former Las Vegas showgirl, has inherited the Cleveland Indians baseball team from her deceased husband. She wants to move the team to Miami, which has promised her a sweetheart deal including a new stadium. In order to do this, she must reduce the season's attendance at Cleveland Stadium to under 800,000 tickets sold, which will trigger an escape clause in the team's lease with the city of Cleveland. Believing that finishing dead last will knock attendance down low enough for her to move, she instructs her new General Manager Charlie Donovan to hire the worst team possible from a list she has already prepared. The list includes veteran catcher Jake Taylor, who has problems with his knees and was last playing in Mexico; incarcerated pitcher Ricky Vaughn, who's due to be paroled soon; power-hitting outfielder Pedro Cerrano, who practices voodoo to improve his game; veteran pitcher Eddie Harris, who no longer has a strong throwing arm and is forced to doctor his pitches; and third baseman Roger Dorn, a one-time star who is under contract but has become a high-priced prima donna. As manager, Phelps hires Lou Brown, a career minor league manager of the Toledo Mud Hens who works in the off-season as a tire salesman.At spring training in Tucson, Arizona, the brash but speedy center fielder Willie ""Mays"" Hayes crashes camp uninvited, but is invited to join the team after displaying his running speed. Spring training reveals several problems with the new players: Vaughn has an incredible fastball but lacks control. Hayes is able to run the bases quickly and steal them effectively, but hits only pop flies, and Cerrano, despite his tremendous power, cannot hit a curveball. The veterans have their own problems: Dorn refuses to aggressively field ground balls, afraid that potential injuries will damage his upcoming contract negotiations, and it becomes clear that Taylor's bad knees will be a season-long concern. Every time a player displays one of their bad habits, Brown forces them to do push-ups or sit-ups on the spot -- when Dorn objects and shows Lou his contract, Lou urinates on it. On the final day, when Brown begins cutting the team down to 25 players, Dorn plays a practical joke on Vaughn, making him believe he was cut, resulting in a locker-room brawl. Taylor intervenes, telling Vaughn not to fight with Dorn (who always badgers the rookies) and to save it for the field.After the team returns to Cleveland before the season begins, Taylor takes Vaughn and Hayes out to dinner but comes across his ex-girlfriend Lynn, who is dining with her current beau. Taylor believes he can try to win her back by proclaiming that he has a major league job again, but is disappointed to hear that she is already engaged.The Indians' new season starts off poorly: Vaughn's initial pitching appearances end in disaster, with his wild pitches earning him the derogatory title ""Wild Thing."" On a rare occasion when Vaughn does get a ball over the plate, it is powered well over 400 feet by the New York Yankees' best hitter, Clu Haywood. Brown discovers that Vaughn's control is off because his eyesight is poor; once Vaughn gets glasses his control greatly improves, and he becomes one of the team's aces and his moniker of ""Wild Thing"" becomes a rallying cry for fans. Despite their flaws, the team begins to improve, so Phelps decides to demoralize them further by removing luxuries, such as replacing their team jet with a dilapidated prop plane, then with an old bus. She also refuses to fix the teams locker room whirlpool and provide a masseuse for injuries. However, these changes do not affect the Indians' performance and the team continues to win.One night after an Indians loss where the team showed great promise, Brown mentions to Donovan that the team could do much better, perhaps even providing a few All-Stars for the league, if there was one thing to pull them all together. Donovan reveals Phelps' plan to Brown, who then relays the same news to the players. Brown also tells them that if the team plays too well for Phelps to void the lease, she will release them all regardless. With nothing to lose, the team agrees to get back at Phelps by winning the pennant. Brown motivates the team further by providing a double-layered cardboard cutout of Phelps from her showgirl days; after every victory, a piece of the outer layer is removed, eventually presenting a (mostly) nude picture of Phelps.The team plays very well down the stretch of the season, and clinch a tie for first in the American League East by beating the Chicago White Sox on the last day of the season. They force a one-game playoff with the division's co-leaders, the Yankees. Prior to the playoff, Taylor continues to try to woo Lynn back and they share a night together. Vaughn learns that he will not be the starting pitcher for the big game and goes to a bar to mope, where he encounters Suzanne Dorn, whom he doesn't know. Feeling spited after seeing her husband Roger on television with another woman, she retaliates by seducing Vaughn. Vaughn is unaware of who she is until she tells him before leaving the apartment.Taylor advises Vaughn to keep his distance from Dorn for most of the game by staying in the bullpen. The game remains scoreless until the seventh inning when Harris gives up two runs. Cerrano comes to the plate in the bottom of the seventh and misses badly on two curveballs. He angrily threatens his voodoo god Jo-bu, then hits the next pitch -- another curve -- for a two-run homer. In the top of the ninth, the Yankees are able to load the bases for the power-hitting Clu Haywood, and Lou decides to bring Vaughn in to pitch to him. Taylor is reluctant but Brown has a strong hunch that Vaughn is due. While Taylor taunts Haywood from behind home plate, Vaughn strikes out his nemesis on three straight fastballs to end the inning, the fastest is clocked at 101 mph.With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Hayes manages an infield single. The Yankees respond by bringing in their headhunting closer, Duke Simpson, to pitch to Taylor. After Hayes steals second, Taylor and Lou trade signs in the dugout, and Taylor points to center field, calling his shot. The Duke responds by throwing a fastball straight at Taylor's head, but the catcher is undeterred and gets back up and points again. However, with Hayes running, Taylor bunts instead, catching the Yankees infield off-guard. Despite his weak knees, Taylor manages to beat out the throw to first as Hayes rounds third and heads for home plate. Hayes slides safely into home, giving the Indians the win on a walk-off single. As the team celebrates, Dorn punches Vaughn in the face but then helps him up to continue the celebration. Jake finds Lynn in the stands, who raises her left hand to show that she is no longer wearing an engagement ring, and they reunite as the film closes."

He screams that the driver is the dumb idiot. Wallace ""Wally"" Karue (Richard Pryor), a blind man, thinks Dave is yelling at him and tries to pick a fight. Unable to hear, Dave walks away; unable to see, Wally swings wildly into the air until his sister, Adele (Kirsten Childs), pulls him into a subway station. Wally sits on the train pretending to read a newspaper while Adele berates him for trying to pass as a seeing person.After losing his money at the racetrack, Wally has his sister drive him to a job interview. He refuses to let Adele escort him and gets out of the car. Another blind man steps up to him, and asks Wally to escort him across the street. Wally walks them into a moving van. He enters Dave Lyons' store to asks for a job. Dave is distracted and he misses reading Wally's lips. Wally becomes infuriated and demands to know if Dave is deaf. Dave screams, ""Yes. Are you blind?"" steps on a big man's coat, and does not respond to the man's request to move. The man pushes Dave over, and Wally throws a punch. He misses and gets hit in the face. Dave yells out the man's location using clock directions and Wally beats the man silly.Later, the two disabled men sit in a park eating ice cream and exchanging life stories. Wally was blinded by a drunk driver, but refuses to let blindness define his life. Dave caught scarlet fever as a teenager, but his hearing loss was gradual. He was an actor until he became deaf. His biggest fear is doing something foolish and having everyone stare at him. Wally claims he can cure Dave of his fear and sticks his ice cream cone onto Dave's head. No one seems to notice.A few days later, Wally is outside the shop retrieving newspapers when his bookie, Scotto (John Capodice), arrives. Scotto realizes Eve (Joan Severance), a beautiful mafia ""hit"" woman is standing outside with her assistant, Kirgo (Kevin Spacey). He asks Dave to read a medicine label for him. When Dave turns his back, he tosses a gold coin into the tip box. Eve comes in, and orders Scotto to come see her boss, Mr. Sutherland. When Scotto refuses, Eve shoots him. Knowing Dave is deaf and did not hear her, Eve grabs Scotto's briefcase, drops her gun, and passes the blind Wally on her way out. Wally comments on her perfume before tripping over Scotto's body. Dave turns in time to see Eve's shapely legs go out the door. He comes around the counter to find Wally lying on Scotto and picks up the gun. Police rush in. Unable to hear the commands to drop the gun, Dave is almost shot, but Wally screams that Dave is deaf. As Dave is arrested, he yells for Wally to empty the tip box and close up. Wally puts the money, including the gold coin in his pocket.At the police station, the two men are told they are suspected of murdering Scotto because Wally owed him $28,000.Across town, Eve and Kirgo discover the briefcase is empty. Realizing Scotto tossed the gold coin into the tip box, Eve proposes she and Kirgo pretend to be the boys' lawyers and arrange bail for them. Wally recognizes Eve's perfume, and Dave recognizes her legs. They tell Police Captain Braddock (Alan North) that their lawyers are the murderers, but Braddock thinks they are crazy. After Wally walks into a wall, Braddock removes his handcuffs. Dave insists they escape and the two disabled men drink from a water fountain. In the elevator, they spit the water into Braddock's and another detective's eyes and rush out. They run into a crowd of political protesters and leave the building with them, walking past Eve, who is arguing with Kirgo.

Instead, she gives him a passionate kiss. She drives off, leaving Dave and Wally with Kirgo. Dave calls out to Wally, helping him knock out Kirgo. Dave and Wally then find a police cruiser with its engine running. The blind Wally leaps behind the wheel, as Dave shouts directions. Soon they are chased by Eve. Kirgo appears in a stolen taxicab followed by Capt. Braddock. The pursuers shoot at the police cruiser, but Wally loses them, only to drive off a pier onto a garbage scow. The scow dumps them in New Jersey. After Wally cuts off Dave's handcuffs, they push the cruiser into a marsh and argue which of them is more maladjusted regarding their handicaps. They telephone Wally's sister, Adele, who drives to the hotel, unaware she is being followed by police.Braddock leads thirty squad cars into the hotel parking lot. He charges into the room to find it empty. When he leaves, however, Adele, Wally and Dave climb out a ventilation shaft.

The resort is hosting a medical convention, so Wally and Dave pretend to be Swedish doctors to gain entrance. After locating Kirgo's room, Adele drives into Kirgo's car. While the man rushes out to deal with her, Dave sneaks into the room leaving Wally in the hall as lookout.The hotel manager finds Wally, and thinking he is one of the Swedish doctors, takes him to deliver a lecture at a gynecology symposium. Not hearing the shower running, Dave enters the bathroom and sees Kirgo's suitcase. As he grabs it, Eve steps out of the shower with soap in her eyes. She grabs a face cloth and returns to the shower, allowing Dave to sneak into the other room to search the case. He finds the coin as Eve steps into the room wrapped only a towel. Pretending he has a gun in his pocket, Dave orders Eve to raise her hands, causing the towel to drop. Dave kisses her before running out the door. Eve sprints to the parking lot, recognizes Adele, and orders Kirgo to grab her.At the symposium, Wally has trouble fielding questions, and pretends he has a blinding headache. Dave bursts into the conference, claims Wally has ""Blindness Anginas,"" and drags him out of the room. In the parking lot, they are given a note ordering them to go to Sutherland's estate, if they wish to see Adele again. Dave drives to Sutherland's mansion and sees Adele being held in a greenhouse. Wally whistles to distract the guard dogs as Dave scales the wall and smashes a window to get inside, not hearing that he has set off an alarm.Eve and a henchman named Herman come into the greenhouse. Eve searches Dave for the coin, but Adele smashes a pot over Herman's head. Dave cannot bring himself to hit Eve, so Adele punches the assassin unconscious. Adele climbs over the wall, but Eve revives and captures Dave. Inside, Kirgo presents Wally and the gold coin to Sutherland, who explains the coin is really a room temperature superconductor. Kirgo points his gun at Sutherland and demands more money, but Sutherland turns off the lights, pulls a pistol from his desk and shoots Kirgo dead. Wally asks what happened and learns that Sutherland is blind. Wally grabs Kirgo's gun and the two sightless men have a gunfight using only their hearing to guide their aim. Wally drops his gun as Eve and Dave appear. Eve points her revolver at Sutherland and demands to know what happened to Kirgo. Sutherland tells her, and again kills the lights, but Eve fires first. The force of the blow sends Sutherland through a wall. Wally hears sirens and suggests Eve give up just as a helicopter appears. She locks Dave and Wally in, but they crawl out the broken wall, toss their coats over a power line and zip-line down the hill, crashing into Eve and the helicopter pilot as police arrive.A few days later, the two are eating ice cream when Dave says he wants to give Wally something. Before Dave can smash his ice cream cone onto Wally's head, Wally does it to him."

The detectives stay on in Japan hoping to work with their Japanese counterparts but have some difficulty dealing with local protocol and customs. Over time, Conklin develops a working relationship with Detective Masahiro and together they manage to ensure justice is served.—garykmcd Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) is a skilled motorcyclist and a tough veteran New York City police officer facing possible criminal charges; Internal Affairs believes Nick was involved with his partner who was caught taking criminal money in a corruption scandal. Nick is divorced from his wife, who has custody of their two children. Nick also has financial difficulties due to alimony and child support as well as other concerns.Nick reports to a criminal investigation hearing being run by two officers from Internal Affairs, a conference that doesn't go well for him. They ask Nick about his involvement with several officers under investigation. When Nick refuses to squeal on his comrades, Internal Affairs threatens him, suggesting he's as corrupt as the others in the department.While having a drink at a local Italian restaurant/bar, Nick and his partner Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) observe two Japanese men having what appears to be a friendly lunch with some Italian gangsters. Nick is increasingly suspicious of the group until another Japanese man enters the restaurant with several armed henchmen and seizes a small package at gunpoint from the leader of the Japanese. As the man turns to leave, one of the Japanese men at the table says, in Japanese, ""The Oyabun [Godfather] will not stand for this."" The leader of the Japanese group chimes in, ""As always, such a troublesome child."" The Japanese man finds these remarks insulting and he stabs one of them in the chest, slashes the other's throat and then walks out. Nick and Charlie follow immediately and, after a short chase, arrest the suspect after he nearly kills Nick in a nearby slaughterhouse.The suspect turns out to be a Yakuza gangster by the name of Sato (Yusaku Matsuda). The situation is further complicated when Nick's superior officer, Captain Oliver (John Spencer), tells him that Sato is to be extradited to Osaka and given to the police there. Nick is angry that Sato will not be tried for murder in the United States, but agrees to escort him to Japan. Nick's captain also has an ulterior motive for sending Nick overseas; he believes the excursion will keep Nick from causing more trouble and exacerbating the already biased Internal Affairs investigation of him.On the long flight to Japan, Nick and Charlie talk about Nick's situation and how Nick's own expenses are beyond his means to pay them. At one point, while Charlie is out of his seat, Sato notices Nick cheating at solitaire and contemptibly chuckles to himself. Nick cruelly hits his prisoner in the mouth and lies about it when Charlie returns and asks what happened.When they arrive in Osaka, men identifying themselves as Japanese police immediately meet them on the plane, display a ""transfer document"" printed in Japanese and take Sato into their custody, leaving the plane by the rear exit. As Nick and Charlie are about to get off the plane themselves, another group of police enter from the front and identify themselves in English, indicating that the first ""cops"" were impostors.Nick and Charlie are taken to the headquarters of the Osaka Prefecture of Police and questioned. They are also blamed for Sato's escape. After much haranguing by Nick (who shows xenophobia) towards the Japanese, who rarely acknowledge that they can speak English, he and Charlie are allowed to observe the hunt for Sato. However, the senior police officer, Ohashi (Shigeru Kôyama) emphasizes that they have no authority in Japan and it is illegal for them to carry their guns, which are confiscated. They are assigned to Masahiro Matsumoto (Takakura), a mild-mannered and experienced officer, who will be their guide.Throughout the investigation Nick behaves rudely, offending Matsumoto, while Charlie tries to be more polite. Taken to a murder scene at a local nightclub, Nick recognizes the murder victim as one of the men at the airport who took Sato into custody. While the dead man is examined by forensics experts, one of them removes a $100 bill from his mouth.Nick makes contact with an American blond nightclub hostess, Joyce (Kate Capshaw), who explains that the Japanese public, including the giggling hostesses in the club, all believe that Nick and Charlie are not to be taken seriously because they allowed Sato to easily escape from custody, and represent American inefficiency and stupidity. Through Joyce, Nick discovers that Sato is fighting a gang war with a notorious crime boss, Sugai (Tomisaburo Wakayama). Sato used to be a lieutenant for Sugai and now wants his own territory to rule. Sato had traveled to New York to disrupt a meeting with American Italian gangsters about a scheme being set up by Sugai involving the package Sato had taken in the restaurant. When they leave the club, Matsumoto offers to drive them back to their hotel; Nick and Charlie turn him down and Nick demands that all reports about Sato's escape and what they saw in the club be translated and given to him the next morning. As they walk back toward their hotel, they're suddenly surrounded and harassed by some of Sato's bosozoku motorcycle gang. Nick is mostly unfazed when Charlie tells him they should cut their losses and go back to New York.Nick and Charlie join a raid on one of Sato's hideouts without permission, goading Matsumoto into joining them. Nick takes some $100 bills from a table, a sly move that is noticed by Matsumoto. Matsumoto takes the blame for bringing Nick and Charlie on the raid from Ohashi. The next day Matsumoto explains they have dishonoured themselves, him and the police force by this theft, which has been reported back to America; Nick angrily claims he ought not to have ""snitched"" to his superiors, and demonstrates the forgery in Ohashi's office. He suggests that the package stolen by Sato was either more samples of the forged bills or plates to make more and storms out.Late one night, after spending a few hours in a nightclub with Matsumoto, Nick and Charlie walk back to their hotel slightly drunk and unescorted, despite previous warnings about their safety from Matsumoto. They are harassed by a young punk on a motorcycle, and it seems to be a joke until the motorcyclist steals Charlies raincoat and lures Charlie into an underground parking garage. Nick follows, shouting for Charlie to come back, but is separated from his partner by a security gate. The unarmed Nick then watches in horror as Sato and several of his bosozoku gang members briefly torture Charlie using swords and knives, before Sato appears and beheads him. Distraught, Nick is comforted by Joyce at her apartment. Matsumoto arrives with Charlie's belongings, including his NYPD badge, which Nick gives to Matsumoto, and Charlie's service pistol, which Nick keeps for himself.Matsumoto and Nick trail one of Sato's operatives, a well-dressed young woman; overnight the policemen discuss their different cultures, and Nick admits to Matsumoto that he had taken some money in New York, where he says there is no ""black-and-white"" procedure, only ""gray"" areas. Matsumoto disagrees, saying ""theft is theft"" and that Nick's illegal action disgraces himself and Charlie. Nick realizes Matsumoto is right and humbly accepts Matsumoto's advice. In the morning the woman retrieves from a bank strongbox a sample counterfeit note (printed only on one side) which she passes to one of Sato's gang on the street. Nick and Matsumoto tail the man to a steel foundry where they find Sato meeting with Sugai, and discover that the package that Sato had stolen in New York contains one of the printing plates for the American $100 bill. Nick intervenes when Sato leaves the meeting and a gunfight ensues. Sato escapes again when Nick is arrested by the swarming police for using a gun in public, and told he will be sent back to New York in disgrace.Nick boards the plane for New York but is able to sneak off to pursue Sato on his own. He finds that Matsumoto has been suspended and demoted by his police force, a deep humiliation. Joyce helps him meet Sugai, who explains that making counterfeit U.S. currency is his revenge for the pollution, the ""black rain"", that he witnessed after the bombing of Hiroshima and the loss of dignity he and his family faced in the aftermath of World War II. Nick suggests a deal where Sugai can use Nick as an insignificant American to retrieve the stolen plate from Sato, leaving Sugai's reputation and hands clean.Sugai drops Nick at the outskirts of a remote farm where a meeting of the oyabun, the other crime bosses of the region, is to take place. Nick is supplied with a shotgun and a handful of shells. Sato arrives a short time later, as does Matsumoto, who subdues one of Sato's men staking out the meeting and who was going to attack Nick. Matsumoto and Nick discover that Sato's men are planning a massacre. At the meeting table, Sato surrenders his single plate and requests recognition and his own territory. However, Sugai demands that Sato first atone for his offenses against the Yakuza code in the traditional way: he is ordered to cut off one of his fingers (yubitsume), which he duly does. As he takes his position next to Sugai, he stabs the elder gangster in the hand and escapes with both the plates, prompting a gunfight between Sugai's and Sato's men. Sato escapes the fight on a dirt bike with Nick close behind. Nick is able to spill Sato off his bike and the two fight briefly, until Nick gains the advantage. The scene ends with Nick having to decide whether or not to kill Sato for Charlie and for all the humiliation he has suffered.The film ends with Matsumoto and Nick walking a handcuffed Sato into police HQ to the amazement of everyone and later receiving commendations, which Nick graciously accepts. At the airport, Nick thanks Matsumoto for his assistance and his friendship. Matsumoto tells Nick that the plates were not found at the scene of the gunfight. Nick tells him that whomever finds them will be set for life -- if they know the right people. As they say their farewells, Nick gives him a gift box containing a dress shirt. Underneath the shirt, Matsumoto finds the two counterfeit printing plates."

When he takes one risk too many, Dorinda faces deep grief and cannot easily put her life back together.—Reid Gagle Pete is a pilot who drops water on forest fires at very low heights. His intended Dorinda is also a pilot who doubles as a radio controller for the pilots who do this work. Pete always takes chances, confident that his skill will bring him through. One day it doesn't and he is killed. He finds himself returning as an invisible ghost who's presence is barely felt giving advice to his successor. Pete then finds that his successor is also falling in love with Dorinda.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Close friends Pete Sandich (Richard Dreyfuss) and Al Yackey (John Goodman) combat major wildfires from the air, flying World War II-vintage water bombers. Pete is a risk taker, to the growing worry of his girlfriend, Dorinda Durston (Holly Hunter), as well as Al. After he runs his plane out of fuel to make an extra retardant drop, Dorinda and Al both express their concern for his safety; Al tells him about the impending start-up of an air attack training base in Flat Rock, Colorado, which will need a commanding officer. Pete dismisses the notion out of hand, with too great a love of flying and fighting fire to give it up for a desk job.The same night, Dorinda pours her heart out to Pete, who reluctantly opts to take the job if it means they will remain together. However, he is called to work an extra day fighting the current fire. As he and Al assault the leading edge of the blaze, Al's plane hits a burning tree, causing an engine fire. Pete makes a dangerously steep dive to drop a retardant load and extinguish Al's engine, but as he tries to pull up out of the wildfire's wrath, his own plane catches fire and explodes.As Dorinda and Al grieve, Pete finds himself walking in a charred forest in the aftermath of a fire, where he comes upon a white-clad woman named Hap (Audrey Hepburn), standing on an oasis of green grass. Pete is stunned when Hap reveals to him that he is dead, but she then goes on to explain that his spirit will be sent back to serve as inspiration to a rookie pilot. The living, she tells him, will be able to ""hear"" him speaking to them through their own thoughts. Six months after his demise, Pete sees his new protegé, Ted Baker (Brad Johnson), at the training base in Flat Rock; he is also delighted to find Al sitting behind the base commander's desk. Due to Ted's questionable record, Al is reluctant to take him on board, but a very loudly spoken ""thought"" from Pete convinces him to give Ted a chance.Al's students prove woefully unprepared to fight fire from the air - especially Ted, who (with guidance from Pete) accidentally dumps a load of retardant directly on Al and his assistant. Furious, Al orders Ted to take a hike before he departs for San Diego, where he finds Dorinda working as an air traffic controller. Al finds that Dorinda still has been unable to let go of Pete, so he brings her back to Flat Rock, where she rents a house at the edge of the airfield.In spite of Al's warning, Ted also returns to Flat Rock, determined to get his air attack certificate; but a malfunctioning guide tractor leads him straight to Dorinda's house. Pete speaks to Dorinda and is relieved to find that her heart still belongs to him. He continues to work with Ted, even as Ted spends more and more time with Dorinda, and - to Pete's anguish - begins to win her over. Again Pete meets Hap, who reminds him that he is wasting spirit by not letting go of Dorinda and trying to intercede between her and Ted.Ted shows some of the remarkable ability he has gained with Pete's guidance in the first major wildfire of the year. However, a distress call from a group of ground firefighters spurs him to fly a rescue mission. Unwilling to watch another lover fly to his death, Dorinda commandeers Ted's plane and flies the mission herself, with Pete attempting to talk her into turning back. When she presses on, Pete changes his approach and guides her through a harrowing flight in the thick of the huge fire, until she successfully drops a load of retardant to clear the firefighters' safe passage to the river.Pete tells Dorinda everything that he never got around to telling her when he was alive, even telling her for the first time that he loves her; but damage to the plane during the rescue mission forces her to make a splash landing in a lake. Sinking to the bottom, she seems about to accept her fate, but Pete appears before her, taking her hand to pull her to the surface. Back at the airfield, Ted and Al rush to greet Dorinda as Pete tells her that he is finally releasing her to her new life.

The Karate Kid Part III,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097647/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ostracised villain John Kreese attempts to gain revenge on Daniel and Miyagi, with the help of a Vietnam War comrade, the wealthy owner of a toxic waste disposal business. John Kreese, his life in tatters after his karate school was defeated by Daniel and Miyagi, visits Terry Silver, a Vietnam War comrade. Terry is a ruthless businessman and martial arts expert, and he vows to help Kreese gain revenge on Daniel and Miyagi, and reestablish Cobra Kai. Upon returning from Okinawa, Daniel and Miyagi discover that their apartment building has been demolished, which brings Miyagi out of work. Going against Miyagi's wishes, Daniel uses his college funds to realize Miyagi's dream of opening a bonsai tree shop, and becomes a partner in the bonsai business.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> After the utter and multi-levelled defeat of Cobra Kai's former instructor, John Kreese, the disgraced and marginalised karate teacher pays a visit to his old Vietnam War buddy, the nefarious millionaire entrepreneur, Terry Silver, to plot his revenge. In the meantime, Mr Miyagi and Daniel-san venture into bonsai business, unaware that the evil partners, Terry and John, conspire to rob the All-Valley karate champion of his title by hiring the thirsty for fame and glory ruthless fighter, Mike Barnes. Eventually, against his mentor's cautious counsels, Daniel will soon fall for the well-planned intricate trap. Could this be the champion's humiliating downfall?—Nick Riganas John G. Avildsen rehashes his shopworn formula for another go-round in The Karate Kid Part III. Going against the wishes of his mentor, Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita), Daniel (Ralph Macchio) will defend his karate title in an All-Valley Championship match arranged by his nemesis Kreese (Martin Kove), whose karate studio folded after his star student lost the championship to Daniel. Kreese's friend, Vietnam veteran and toxic waste dumper Terry (Thomas Ian Griffith), agrees to help his old pal regain the championship trophy. Daniel's rival Mike Barnes (Sean Kanan) is known as ""the bad boy of karate,"" and Daniel feels he requires more training to vanquish him. But Mr. Miyagi refuses to help Daniel train for the tournament: ""Karate to defend life and honor means something. To defend a plastic trophy means nothing."" As a result, Daniel naively falls into the clutches of Terry, who takes him on as a karate student. But after Daniel finds himself trapped at the bottom of a cliff and Daniel's girlfriend, Jessica (Robyn Lively), has her life threatened, Mr. Miyagi realizes the bad guys have gone too far and agrees to coach Daniel for the tournament. After returning home from Okinawa, Daniel and Miyagi decide to go into business together by opening a bonsai tree shop. Their plans are complicated when National All-Time Karate Champion Mike Barnes coerces Daniel into defending his title at the upcoming All-Valley Tournament. When Miyagi refuses to train him, Daniel approaches the charismatic karate expert Terry Silver for help. Unbeknownst to Daniel, Silver is secretly in cahoots with Barnes, and also happens to be a wartime buddy of Daniel's arch-rival John Kreese who has made it his personal priority to seek revenge on Daniel for Cobra Kai's humiliating defeat at the prior All-Valley Tournament. Can Daniel step back from the brink before it's too late?—No One The movie begins with montages from the first Karate Kid movie, followed by the first scene in The Karate Kid II, where John Kreese (Martin Kove) is severely humiliated by Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) in front of all of Kreese's students.Cut to Kreese going into his dojo. A number of mail envelopes are on the floor, having been slid through the mail slot in the front door. He quickly throws them in the trash and stares reverently at a photo of his stint in the U.S. Army as its 1970-1972 karate champion, before going into his office in the dojo.Ever since his humiliation at Mr. Miyagi's hands, all of Kreese's students have left him and the Cobra Kai. His dojo has been completely empty for several months now, leaving him with no income and now broke. All of his assorted creditors are beginning to harass him for payment on now-long overdue bills. The organizers of the All-Valley tournament that Daniel (Ralph Macchio) won is dropping the Cobra Kai from its membership rolls due to non-payment of dues. As he listens to a recording on his answering machine of his prone provider threatening to disconnect him, he picks up a newspaper clipping article devoted to Daniel's victory in the tournament and crumples it in his hands.Broke, hungry and alone, Kreese goes to the one friend he has left: Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith), an army buddy whose life was saved by Kreese several times, and the founder of the Kobra Kai, now a shady and very wealthy businessman dealing with nuclear energy. Kreese goes to hand Silver the dojo keys, saying he is going away, saying good-bye, and will pay him the back rent soon as he finds a new line of work, as he has had no students for nine months. Silver declines, getting Krese to tell him the story of his troubles, and promising to take care of him. Silver learns the story of Daniel and Miyagi and promises to help Kreese make things right. First, he is sending Kreese for some R&R time in Tahiti. Then he's going to formulate a plan to make sure Daniel and Miyagi have to pay for humiliating Kreese. They exchange military salutes before Silver drives off, after dropping Kreese off at the airport.Kreese, walking toward his flight, closely misses passing by Daniel and Miyagi as they are returning from Okinawa (the setting of The Karate Kid II); he does not notice them coming out of their flight, nor do they notice him. Daniel's mother, Lucille (Randee Heller) was supposed to pick them up at the airport, but Daniel told her they were coming in on the following day, mischievously saying that she loves surprises.Arriving via taxicab back at the site of Daniel's apartment, Daniel and Miyagi find that the building has been sold by the landlord, and the new owner has evicted everyone and torn it down to build a spa. Miyagi is now out of a job and Daniel and his mother are homeless. The neighbor who informs them of this, tells Daniel that Lucille asked for Daniel to call her collect at the home of Lucille's uncle, Louie, with whom she is now staying.Miyagi speaks to Lucille on the phone and assures her that he is happy to put Daniel up at his home for a while. Uncle Louie has emphysema and Lucille will need to stay with him a while to take care of him. Lucille sighs with relief and gratitude at Miyagi's kind charity.Daniel talks to his mother and tells her (to her great thrill) that college registration is in just a few days. Unfortunately, Kumiko (the Okinawan girl with whom Daniel was involved in The Karate Kid II) will not be coming to America to be with Daniel, though the reason why is very fortuitous-- she was offered a good job with a prestigious Tokyo dance company and couldn't turn it down.Helping Mr. Miyagi about the house, Daniel finds that Miyagi is emotional about having to give up his prized bonsai trees, as without a job he can no longer take care of them. Daniel suggests he open a store to sell the bonsai trees, and Miyagi admits he dreamt about it, for when he was able to retire.Needing to help his mentor who is now facing hardship, Daniel insists on helping Miyagi open a store-- a proposal Miyagi, of course, is strongly opposed to because Daniel would be using the money set aside for his attending college. To Miyagi, Daniel's college education is far too important to sacrifice.But Daniel disagrees, and secretly takes a cab to a local realtor, holding a classified section of a local newspaper in his hand.Silver is on the phone with Kreese, discussing their plan of revenge. Silver plots to have Daniel intimidated into leaving Miyagi and going to Silver to train him to defend his championship in the karate tournament, where Silver would get Daniel overconfident and thinking he couldn't be beaten-- setting him up for a major fall. He assures Kreese he can get Daniel to participate in the tournament. Silver has bought a number of additional dojos for Kreese to run after he returns from Tahiti. Asked if there's anything else he needs, Kreese stares at his hand and asks Silver to make Daniel's knuckles bleed.As he prepares to be driven off to a social event, Silver speaks to his staff about what portion of his revenge plan he has chosen to share with him. This involves procuring a new wardrobe and vehicle for him that will make him look poor and humble, hiding his status as a wealthy entrepreneur.As he rides in his chauffeured limo, Silver browses through a karate magazine and finds exactly what he was looking for-- a young champion with a record of tournament victories and a ruthless attitude. The article calls him 'karate's bad boy-- Mike Barnes' (Sean Kanan).Daniel is arriving back at Miyagi's home, where Miyagi has just finished preparing supper... and he tells Miyagi exactly what the elderly mentor does not want to hear; instead of registering for college, he used the tuition money to pay for a lease on an available store for Miyagi to open a bonsai shop. Daniel insists that he wouldn't be able to finish college if he was taking courses there just for the sake of continuing his education-- he needs the break from schooling and the store's success can then put him through college once he's ready to go. Gushing with excitement, Daniel drives Miyagi (without them eating supper) to the empty store lot he's leased. The store is run-down but Daniel isn't worried; it's opportunity knocking. He even points out a pottery shop right across the street where they can strike a deal for planters. Miyagi is less enthused than Daniel about the opening of the shop, but seeing that this time, he cannot budge Daniel, consents-- on the condition that Daniel is his full partner in the shop instead of his employee.Silver is sitting in a bath, giving dictation for letters to his secretary, when he's told that Mike Barnes has arrived as per his invitation. Silver introduces Barnes to two young neighborhood toughs named Snake (Jonathan Avildsen) and Dennis (William Christopher Ford) who Silver has hired to assist Barnes with everything he'll need. Barnes will live and train on Silver's property, and if he achieves the goal of beating Daniel in the All-Valley tournament, he'll receive 25% ownership in the new chain of Kobra Kai dojos Silver has opened. Barnes states that he wants 50% ownership, making him a full partner. Silver finds this a little too ambitious and offers 35%. Barnes thanks Silver for the hospitality and starts to leave. Impressed at the young man's moxie, Silver gives in-- Barnes will be a fully equal, 50% owner.Miyagi and Daniel are gathering a wild sapling to cultivate as a bonsai, and Miyagi explains the significance of a bonsai tree's strong roots-- something it has in common with Daniel's inner heart and spirit, where his karate comes from-- only the root of it came from Miyagi himself, and that root allowed Daniel's spirit to grow and flourish. Daniel is puzzled, as Bonsai are cultivated with wires and clippers, but Miyagi says that 'true' bonsai grow wild without any aid from caretakers. Miyagi has seen them in his homeland in Okinawa. In America, he's only seen one-- the one personal treasure he brought from his homeland... which he's planted in a nearby gorge called Devil's Cauldron. Finding a peaceful, secluded spot on a hill, Miyagi begins to teach Daniel a kata, or form, practiced by members of Miyagi's family. As they practice, the camera pans away to show Devil's Cauldron.The next day, Daniel and Miyagi are working in the shop, getting it ready for opening. As they prepare one of the bonsai trees Miyagi has been caring for, Daniel tells him about a letter from the All-Valley Tournament announcing a change in the rules-- as the defending champion, Daniel would only need to compete in the final match; he gets a free bye through all the preliminary and quarter/semi-final rounds. But despite this, Miyagi is unwilling to sponsor Daniel to defend his championship in the tournament. He had done it the previous year in order to help him escape the bullying and harassment he had undergone at the hands of Kreese's students. Now that Kreese was no longer a problem for them, the tournament had no more meaning to them-- karate, to Miyagi, is worthless when used as a sport.Daniel goes to the pottery shop across the street to buy a pot for the bonsai tree. Working at the shop, molding a pot out of clay, is an attractive young red-haired woman named Jessica Andrews (Robyn Lively). Daniel tells her a little bit about the shop he and Miyagi are opening, which stirs Jessica's interest, as she loves bonsai trees. Daniel shows her the size and shape of pots he's looking to buy and arranges for Jessica to make embossments of a bonsai tree on a few of them as a trademark of the shop. As he leaves, he says, 'see you soon,' and Jessica asks, 'how soon?' showing she is interested in him. Taking the offered bone, he sets up a date with Jessica for that night at 7 pm.As Daniel returns to the shop, Miyagi hands him back the application for the All-Valley karate tournament, but Daniel is confused when he sees it is unsigned. Miyagi tells Daniel that the answer lives inside of him-- and he can get rid of his confusion very easily by discarding the application.That evening, as Daniel gets ready for his date with Jessica, Silver sneaks into the home and goes through Miyagi's box containing his war memorabilia. Finding that Miyagi served with the 442nd division in the Army, Silver smiles in satisfaction. He sees Miyagi's medal of valor on the wall, and then happens to spot a flier on the ground advertising the opening of the bonsai shop. Just then Daniel is approaching the room just as Miyagi is arriving home from the other side.As Miyagi picks up a buddha statue to put in the store for good luck, Daniel shows him the All-Valley tournament application and burns it, much to Miyagi's gratitude and satisfaction. After they leave, coughing is heard, and Silver's feet come down out of the chimney, where he had hid to escape notice from both Daniel and Miyagi.Daniel picks up Jessica and she starts to explain that she is in the process of reconciling with a boyfriend she'd broken up with, and was going to see him again when she went back home to Columbus, Ohio for Thanksgiving. She's apologetic for coming on strong, because she'd been in L.A. for two months and has no real friends. Taking the news much better than Jessica had hoped, Daniel says he'll be her first friend in L.A. and offers to bring her to the bonsai store to meet Mr. Miyagi.After making the introductions and Miyagi starts heading home, Daniel brings Jessica inside the store to show her around, and the work they've done on it so far. Jessica is interested when Daniel tells her that Miyagi has been teaching him karate; even more so when Daniel shows how Miyagi can make lessons out of the most seemingly disconnected tasks. He has Jessica do the hand motions she used when she was molding a ceramic pot, and shows how she can use those motions to defend against a mugger.But just then, worse trouble than a mere mugger invites itself into the shop... Snake and Barnes. They've found out that Daniel has chosen not to enter the All-Valley tournament and are here to see that he changes his mind-- Barnes' financial future is riding on facing Daniel for the championship. They have brought a new application for Daniel to sign. When he refuses, Barnes is ready to fight him then and there, but Snakes pulls him back, suggesting they let Daniel 'sleep on it.'The next morning, Daniel and Miyagi are practicing the kata on the lawn. Silver arrives on the property, putting the next phase of his plan into action. He is dressed in very ordinary-looking street clothes, making him look like a simple and humble man. He approaches Miyagi and bows respectfully, introducing himself and saying who his teacher was, and that John Kreese was the teacher's number one student. Silver says that word only reached he and his teacher in Korea two months ago about what happened the previous year at the All-Valley tournament; the trouble Kreese created, and both Silver himself and his teacher are remorseful about it. Silver says he came back to America to help Kreese 'regain balance,' but arrived too late-- Kreese, as Silver tells them, has died of a broken heart after losing all his students. Silver explains that Kreese was once an honorable man and a war hero who saved Silver's life many times during Vietnam-- a point Miyagi understands all too well. Silver feigns being impressed to hear that Miyagi was in the 442nd Army Division. He also gives a humble bow and apology to Daniel over what Kreese had put him through, and suddenly excuses himself, apologizing for interrupting their training. But Miyagi and Daniel both give him a parting expression of condolences on Kreese's death.Later that evening Daniel is doing more work around the shop when Jessica arrives-- she was supposed to have dinner with her aunt, who owns the pottery shop, but the aunt had to cancel out, so Jessica brought over the macaroni and cheese to share with Daniel. As they sit down to eat, Jessica shows Daniel one of the pots she's finished with the embossment. Daniel, in turn, gives Jessica some tickets to a local dance club for her last night in L.A. before she returns home.A dance of a different kind, however, is on the horizon as Barnes arrives with Snake and Dennis to harass Daniel about signing the entry form for the All-Valley tournament. To help deal with Daniel's 'obstinance,' they start to trash the shop. Dennis pushes Daniel, who pushes back. Dennis throws a punch, and Daniel uses his skills to defend himself and defeat Dennis. Snake starts to lunge at Daniel, but Jessica picks up the ceramic pot and jams it into Snake, knocking him down. As Snake falls, Jessica finds that she is right in back of Barnes-- and he is looking over his shoulder right at her.Barnes knows just what button to push-- he kicks Jessica in her belly with a scoop kick and doubles her over. Daniel and Barnes clash, and Barnes quickly gains the upper hand. Miyagi arrives to fend Barnes and his henchmen off. They hurry out of the store back into their car, shouting that they've just begun their 'persuasion.' Daniel, Miyagi and Jessica watch them drive off; Jessica still holding her stomach in pain, which sets Daniel's blood boiling.As he drives himself and Daniel back home, Miyagi tries to soothe Daniel's nerves by singing, and saying that they were fortunate that the bonsai tree was back at home, safe from the trashing of the shop. Unfortunately Daniel is very badly worked up and Miyagi's efforts do very little to calm him down.And even Miyagi himself is not in much more mood for further singing when they arrive home-- the bonsai trees are missing, and in their place on the workbench is an entry form for the tournament. Daniel completely loses his patience when Miyagi chooses to go fishing rather than let himself lose control as Daniel himself has. Daniel gets back into the car to report the robbery to the police.Without the stock of trees, Daniel and Miyagi have nothing to sell. And the police literally laughed Daniel off when he went to them looking to press charges against Barnes for the robbery; Daniel too upset to understand that he doesn't have a whit of solid proof that Barnes was behind it. Desperate, he goes with Jessica to Devil's cauldron without Miyagi's knowledge, to retrieve the wild bonsai tree, which Miyagi had said was worth a lot of money. Scanning the gorge with his binoculars, Daniel locates the site where Miyagi planted the tree. Jessica, skilled in rappelling, knows how to help Daniel get down the gorge so they can retrieve it.The rappel down the cliff proves more formidable than Jessica had anticipated. Daniel loses his footing and she scrambles to steady him. Then, just as Daniel has unearthed the wild bonsai and is starting to carefully pack it away, Jessica loses her own footing and almost falls. The tree drops down onto the rocks at the bottom. Both Daniel and Jessica must rush to retrieve it before the salt water from the tide soaks into the tree and kills it. They rinse it thoroughly with clean water from a canteen before re-packing it. That's when they notice the ropes are being pulled up the cliff.Sure enough, Barnes, snake and Dennis have found them again. They toss down a bundled-up application form for the All-Valley Tournament. If Daniel doesn't sign it, they will simply leave, and the three of them all know that the tide will come into the gorge starting in twelve minutes. Daniel and Jessica would drown and Barnes would never be suspected. Enraged, Daniel signs the form and says that if Barnes wants it, he has to pull Daniel and Jessica up.But Barnes, Snake and Dennis only pull them up to just shy of the cliff face before making him hand over the form to examine it and see that there was no trickery. Each time Daniel becomes obstinate, they let Jessica slide down several feet, threatening to drop her. Once the form is handed over, suddenly the ""price"" goes up. Now they want the wild tree. Again they threaten to drop Jessica until Daniel does as is demanded. Then, to his horror, Barnes takes hold of the tree's trunk and snaps it apart lengthwise like breaking a wishbone.Daniel is sick with misery as he arrives back a the bonsai shop during a pouring thunderstorm with the broken tree in tow. Miyagi tends to the tree very carefully as Daniel pleads for forgiveness. Miyagi doesn't know if the tree will recover-- he says it depends on how strong the roots are.Later, Daniel is training on the lawn when Silver puts the next phase of his plan into action. Barnes arrives to harass him over calling the cops. He tries to pick another fight when Silver arrives, ordering him to back down. Barnes and Silver stage a mock battle where Silver easily handles Barnes and chases him off. Silver mentions to Daniel that he's re-opening the Cobra Kai dojos so that the school can make up for its past misdeeds. He good-naturedly offers to teach Daniel a couple of moves and shows him a front leg sweep. He says that if Daniel ever needs it, he can approach Silver to help with training.Daniel hurries to the bonsai shop where Jessica is showing Miyagi a number of pots she's finished with the tree embossment. Daniel asks Miyagi to show him 'how to sweep.' He doesn't need any training for the tournament, just to be shown this one thing. Miyagi, of course, knows better. He gives Daniel the pot and excuses himself, saying he will be right back. He then comes out wiht a broom, 'explaining' how to use it in sweeping. Jessica giggles appreciatively at Miyagi's wit, but Daniel gets very upset, thinking Miyagi is making fun of him, and drives off in a huff.Daniel goes to the Cobra Kai dojo to take Silver up on his offer. Covertly covering himself by inquiring how Miyagi feels about it and being assured that Miyagi neither knows nor needs to know, Silver now puts the next phase of his plan into action. He begins to slowly and gradually get Daniel to vent his anger and frustration at being bullied by Barnes. He brings Daniel to a ""training dummy"" with two 2x4 boards for legs, and several other thick plans for the chest and head. He has Daniel practice sweeps on the legs until his foot is hurt. Silver shows how he easily breaks the boards and 2x4's, saying 'extreme situations require extreme measures.' As they finish for the night, Silver snickers to himself on noticing that Daniel is hobbling slightly on his hurt foot.Daniel hurries back to Miyagi's home, but Miyagi knows that something is going on. He takes an herbal powder and puts it into hot water so Daniel can soak his hurt foot, slyly suggesting that the next day, Daniel will 'remember' how he injured it. In the solitude of his own room, Miyagi looks at a photo of himself and Daniel when he first began training him, saying that Daniel has a lot of confusion in his soul, and Miyagi's own heart is empty without him.Daniel is back at the Cobra Kai dojo where Silver feigns impression at the bruise on Daniel's foot being healed. Silver asks what the last thing was that Daniel learned from Miyagi. Told that they were practicing kata, Silver says that kata is good-- for practice, but not winning a tournament. He has already explained that a man cannot fight if he can't stand. Now he goes to his second 'rule,' that a man has to breathe. He has Daniel focus on delivering forward elbow strikes to the thick heavy boards that make up the chest of the training dummy. Daniel is almost timid about hitting the boards because of how they had hurt him when he was sweeping the 'legs' of the dummy. Silver simply turns the boards for the ""head"" around where a poster of Barnes has been pasted, slyly suggesting that Barnes is the training dummy. Feigning exasperation at Daniel seemingly being afraid of some pain, he walks away, but then hides behind a wall and listens, snickering quietly again as Daniel begins hitting the boards more aggressively.That night, Daniel sneaks into Miyagi's room and retrieves the herbal powder to soak his elbow. Miyagi's left eye cracks slightly open to show that he was aware of Daniel's actions. Miyagi knocks at Daniel's door panel to ask why Daniel is doing what he's doing to himself. Trying to hide everything and getting exasperated at himself as much as anyone else, Daniel lays into Miyagi, telling him off. Miyagi's face as he turns away, shows increasing sorrow.Daniel is doing kata at the Cobra Kai dojo when Silver arrives to continue training. His third rule is that a man can't fight if he can't see. A solid punch to the nose would leave an opponent down and out. He tricks Daniel into believing that it's ""not his fault"" if the opponent ""ran into his fist"" while lunging at him, then has him return to the training dummy. Goading Daniel about what Barnes has been doing and still wants to do to Daniel, he brings all of Daniel's anger to the surface until the young man punches the boards so hard, he lacerates his knuckles, leaving a blood stain on the poster of Barnes pasted over the head-boards of the dummy. Having fulfilled this promise he made to Kreese, Silver then baits Daniel one last time. Daniel, powered by his anger, sweeps through the 2x4 legs, shatters the chest-boards with his elbow and then punches through the head-board, just as Silver had done. Excited for entirely different reasons than Daniel, Silver celebrates Daniel's achievement with him, exchanging whoops and high-fives.Daniel takes Jessica to the dance club 'Downstairs' for her last night in LA. As they dance, a young man and woman are arguing bitterly and the woman storms out in a huff. Hiding behind a pillar so as not to be seen by Daniel, is Silver. Having overheard the argument, Silver carefully approaches the young man and offers him some money to pick a fight with Daniel a little later on.Presently, Jessica has danced long enough that she needs something to drink. She and Daniel are on their way to the refreshment bar when Silver 'bumps into them.' As Daniel is introducing Jessica to Silver, the young man makes his move as Silver had secretly arranged. He starts to come on to Jessica in a rude manner, brushing Daniel aside. Without hesitating, glaring at the young man, Daniel fires a karate punch that sends the young man to the floor with a broken nose. Almost immediately he is in disbelief at what he's done, listening to a horrified Jessica raise her voice at him. Silver quickly hurries Daniel away, out of the club, so as not to be nabbed by the club's security. As he spirits Daniel from the club, Silver congratulates him, saying he's reached the peak of what Silver has been teaching him. But Daniel is not happy with himself-- and hearing Silver talk, he's beginning to realize that what he's been learning from Silver has made him into a different person than what he had become while learning from Miyagi.Daniel goes to see Jessica to apologize for what happened at the club, trying to explain that it 'wasn't him' who she saw turn overly aggressive right before her eyes. When Jessica curtly tells him that she's only seeing him having more trouble keeping his temper, Daniel falls into complete misery, almost losing coherence as he tries to make sense of all that's been happening to him. Moved to compassion, Jessica tries to reassure him that although she was very unhappy at what he did at the club, she forgives him for it and is still his friend, and she knows Miyagi will be the same way-- he'd told her himself that he loves Daniel and has great faith in him. As hard as Daniel feels it will be, Jessica gently insists that once he goes to Miyagi to reconcile with him, and the young man whose nose he broke, everything else will fall into place.At the bonsai shop, Daniel is frustrated trying to get the local hospital staff to put him in contact with the young man he attacked; as he broke the young man'se nose and is positive that the man is at the hospital being treated. He snaps at the reception nurse, who hangs up on him. Miyagi goes up to him, looking to show him something that will help return some balance to Daniel's life. The wild bonsai tree is budding again. It is recovering well from the abuse at Barnes' hands and will once again thrive and be beautiful. Miyagi says that this is because of the tree's strong root. Like the tree, Daniel also has a strong root from which he grows.Daniel calms down and understands that the first thing he has to do to receive forgiveness, is to forgive himself. The next step, he knows, is that he must go to Silver and explain that he can no longer train with him. Daniel feels he must do this right away, and promises Miyagi that he won't be gone long. But as Daniel leaves, Miyagi is seen looking after him with a very worried expression.Daniel goes to the dojo to explain that he's grateful for all that Silver has taught him, but he cannot continue, and he is not going to compete at the All-Valley Tournament. The person who broke the young man's nose at the dance club was not the person Daniel truly is inside. He has come here in person to give Silver a proper goodbye, believing he owed Silver that much.Silver drops his charade at that point. His lessons weren't free and he's been busy making Daniel do things he didn't want to do, from the moment they met. Finally revealing his true colors, Silver shows Daniel that he is the one behind Mike Barnes-- and that John Kreese is very much alive and well, and that Silver's ultimate agenda was avenging Kreese. Daniel does not want to fight, so Silver is happy to use him as a punching bag.But Miyagi suspected trouble and had followed Daniel to the dojo, and shows up to protect Daniel. Even Silver is no match for Miyagi's skill. As Miyagi starts to hurry Daniel out of the dojo, Silver taunts the two with the news that he is going to open Cobra Kai dojos all over California and Daniel and Miyagi will only be a memory. Daniel asks if Miyagi will train him for the tournament now, and Miyagi says that now, he will. Once again, much more than a mere sport competition is on the line.Montages are shown of Daniel and Miyagi doing kata on the beach, as Barnes trains with Kreese and Silver, savaging a sparring partner. After the montages, we see Daniel and Miyagi descending into the Devil's Cauldron gorge to re-plant the wild bonsai. As they re-plant it, Miyagi repeats his lectures on Daniel having a strong root, just as the tree does-- the tree's root allows it to choose which way to grow.The day of the tournament arrives. Barnes destroys his last opponent to reach the finals and face Daniel for the championship. Before the final match, the announcer gives Silver the microphone to address the crowd. Silver has financed the tournament having a permanent new home, and he tells the crowd that he is re-opening the Cobra Kai dojos around California. Daniel and Miyagi listen with distaste as Silver preaches positive karate values that only they know, he has no belief in whatsoever.As they prepare for the final match against Daniel, Silver gives Barnes a run-down of the game plan. Barnes is to score a clean point, but then perform an illegal move with excessive contact, in order to lose the point to penalty. He will continue to score points and then lose them in the alloted time for the contest to ensure that the score is 0-0. When sudden death is called, Barnes will defeat Daniel once and for all, to show that the Cobra Kai is the dominant way.Barnes enjoys beating Daniel from pillar to post; gaining a point and then losing it, gaining another point and then losing it, finally just lacing into Daniel with roughhouse moves that score no points due to excessive contact without proper technique. As time runs out for the match, a one-minute rest period is called before sudden death.As sudden death is called, Daniel huddles on the floor, reluctant to get up to face Barnes again. As Miyagi goes to him, Daniel admits that he is afraid of Barnes and cannot face him any further. He nearly cries in misery and fear before Miyagi shouts to snap him out of it, forcing him to focus. Miyagi tells him that losing to an opponent is perfectly fine, but losing to fear is not. His best karate is still inside him-- it's time to let it out.At that moment, Barnes ruthlessly taunts Daniel, telling him that both he and Miyagi are nothing and will be quickly forgotten by everyone who comes to watch the tournament. This angers Daniel and makes him want to fight again... but as the referee goes through the preparatory steps to start sudden death, Daniel quickly remembers that anger will only make him fall right back into Silver's trap. As the referee signals for sudden death to begin, Daniel centers himself and begins to perform the kata.Barnes backs off, looking at Daniel in complete bewilderment. Silver, thinking Daniel has simply lost it, orders Barnes to score the final point and finish Daniel. Letting his anger bubble to the surface, Barnes charges in with a lunge punch meant to take Daniel down.But Daniel catches the punch and flips Barnes down to the ground, pulling a punch after Barnes falls, scoring a clean point himself to win the contest and successfully defend his championship. All of Silver's carefully orchestrated plans fall to ruin in that one brief second where the referee declares Daniel the second-time champion. Silver and Kreese storm off as the spectator crowd cheers wildly for Daniel. The movie ends with an overjoyed Daniel telling Miyagi to forget about bowing, and then giving his teacher and friend a hug."
The 'Burbs,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096734/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An overstressed suburbanite and his neighbors are convinced that the new family on the block is part of a murderous Satanic cult. He's a man of peace in a savage land: Suburbia. When secretive new neighbors move in next door, suburbanite Ray Peterson and his friends let their paranoia get the best of them as they start to suspect the newcomers of evil doings and commence an investigation.But it's hardly how Ray, who much prefers to drink beer, read his newspaper, and watch a ballgame on the tube, expected to spend his vacation.—purstris This story takes place in a typical American neighborhood, when new neighbors come to live in the house next to Ray Peterson. These new people are really strange: nobody has ever seen them, their house is a real mess, and during the night weird noises keep coming from their basement. The only thing they know is their name: Klopek. One day Walter (an old man of the neighborhood) suddenly disappears and everyone starts to suspect the Klopeks.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Ray Peterson takes a week off from work just to walk around in pajamas all day, read the newspaper, and lie low. However, Ray has some very peculiar neighbors. He actually has no ""normal"" neighbors, but one particular neighbor is especially strange. Therefore, Ray and the other neighbors decide to investigate what's wrong with the Klopeks, and the relaxing week off from work becomes something far from relaxing.—Lars J. Aas <larsa@colargol.edb.tih.no> The Klopek family moves into an old house in a new neighborhood and act in very unusual ways. Everyone nearby is concerned about why these new people are acting strangely and the people have never seen them before. Plus, no one has greeted them for the month they've moved in there. Then three neighbors team up to see if they can figure out what is really going on with the Klopeks.—Atariman The movie opens at night, on Mayfield Place, a Cul-De-Sac in the fictional suburban town of Hinkley Hills. Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) awakens to strange noises coming from the house of his mysterious new next-door neighbors, the Klopeks, and goes outside to investigate. On his way back inside, he sees the cigar-smoking Vietnam veteran Lt. Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) watching the Klopeks' house from his bedroom window. The following morning, Ray watches Queenie, the dog of fellow neighbor Walter Seznick (Gale Gordon), defecate on Rumsfield's lawn. Then, we meet Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman), who lives across the street and is painting his house. Moments later, Rumsfield comes out and accidentally steps on it, causing a scene with Walter.Later, Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun), the Petersons' other next-door neighbor, almost kills Ray while attempting to shoot some crows, then invites himself into Ray's home for breakfast. Ray and Art attempt to speak with their new neighbors, but are thwarted by an attack of bees.That evening, Art and Ray spy on the Klopeks with Rumsfield. With Ricky and his girlfriend watching them, the three men watch Hans Klopek (Courtney Gains) drive his dilapidated Pontiac from the garage to the curb, then pull a large, heavy garbage bag from the car, place it in a garbage can and bang it with a stick. During the night, Ray watches the Klopeks digging in their back yard with pick-axes in the middle of a rainstorm. The following morning, Art runs out to check the contents of the garbage truck as it is collecting the Klopeks' can from the previous night. He is soon joined by Rumsfield and Ray, but their search in the hope of finding human remains is futile.Bonnie Rumsfield (Wendy Schaal) finds Queenie running loose and wonders if Walter went away and forgot to feed her. Ray, Art, Bonnie and Ricky go to Walter's house and Rumsfield, who removed a window pane, lets them in. Inside, they find Walter's toupee in the kitchen. Noting that the television was left on and a chair was turned over, Art and Rumsfield begin to worry. Ray collects Queenie and leaves a note for Walter explaining that he has his dog, seen by an older Klopek. The following night, Ray and Art have a meeting in the Petersons' basement and theorize about Walter's disappearance.The following morning, Rumsfield and Art write a note to the Klopeks (""I know what you've done."") and slip it under their door. Art goes next door to tell Ray of the deed, which upsets him he was seen writing to Walter. As Ray talks to Art, Ray's dog Vince brings to them a bone he dug up from under the fence. Art identifies the bone as a femur, and believes it to belong to Walter. At the request of Carol (Carrie Fisher), Ray's wife, she, Ray, Rumsfield and Bonnie pay the Klopeks a visit. Art, intentionally not invited, snoops around in the Klopeks' back yard while the visitors meet Hans, Reuben (Brother Theodore) and Werner (Henry Gibson) inside. Later that evening, Ray has a meeting with Art and Rumsfield and reveals that he found Walter's toupee in the Klopeks' basement the previous day after he had earlier slipped it back through Walter's mail-slot. The trio agree to investigate the contents of the Klopeks' back yard when the owners leave in the morning.As the Klopeks leave for a meeting at the university, Carol and son Dave (Cory Danziger) go to visit Carol's sister, Evelyn, leaving Ray free to explore the Klopeks' backyard. Their first order of business is to disable the Klopeks' security system. The result ends up almost electrocuting Art, but ends up disabling the alarm while also cutting off the power to the entire neighborhood. Art and Ray then jump over their fence into the Klopeks' yard while Rumsfield watches the proceedings from the roof of his house and Ricky invites his friends to watch Rumsfield. After hours of digging and finding nothing incriminating, Ray and Art venture into the Klopek house, where they discover in the basement a giant furnace with a capability of reaching a temperature of 5,000 degrees.Ray then begins to dig into the loose soil that constitutes the basement floor, believing there may be dead bodies buried there.
That evening, the Klopeks drive back to their home, only to reverse out when they see lights on in the basement. Not long after, Rumsfield, Art and Ricky are perturbed to see Walter return home. Then the Klopeks return with the police and Art tells Ricky to delay them while he goes into the Klopeks' home and rescues Ray. Ray hits a gas line with his pick-ax while continuing to dig out the basement floor. He yells for Art to flee right before the house explodes into flames with Ray still inside. A few minutes later, a disheveled Ray emerges from the flames just as his wife returns from dropping Dave at her sister's house.Art talks to an officer, who explains that Walter had a medical problem and his family took him to the hospital. While away, Walter had made arrangements for the Klopeks to pick up his mail. When Ray had previously slipped the toupee back through the mail slot, it got picked up with the mail and newspapers. Ray is read the charges against him and ignores them in favor of admiring Carol's new hairstyle. Ray then snaps at Art and gives his ""We're the lunatics, not them"" speech, before lunging at Art and then throwing himself into an ambulance on a gurney.As Ray has concluded that he and the neighbors were wrong about the Klopeks, Werner Klopek joins Ray in the ambulance a short while later. Werner, thinking Ray must have seen the skull of one of his former neighbors in the basement, attempts to murder Ray to collect his skull too, revealing that Art was right all along about the Klopeks. Hans assumes the role of the ambulance driver, but crashes into the Weingartners' house during the three-way struggle. The gurney, with Ray and Werner aboard, rolls out of the ambulance and down the street. Ray makes a citizen's arrest on his would-be murderer as Ricky uncovers a large selection of bones in the Klopeks' trunk. The Klopeks are then arrested and the charges against Ray are dropped."
Fletch Lives,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097366/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After receiving an inheritance in Louisiana, Los Angeles reporter Irvin Fletcher heads to the Belle Isle plantation where he gets himself into hilarious trouble. Ailing Los Angeles newspaper reporter Irvin ""Fletch"" Fletcher, in debt, inherits from a aunt ""Bell Isle"", a sprawling 80-acre Louisiana plantation estate, quits his job and moves east expecting to live like a Dixie king. But he failed to inspect the run-down inheritance, leaving him only a shabby mansion with a shifty caretaker instead of reliable staff. Having celebrated anyway with an attractive lawyer in bed, he wakes up finding her mysteriously murdered and himself jailed, soon to be bailed, as prime suspect. Undaunted by a neighborly lawyer's warning to leave town, he waves foxy real estate agent Becky Culpepper's persistent offer well above the apparent value from a third party and starts snooping why with Becky. That proves a dangerous activity for him and almost anybody around, everything pointing to local magnate Hamilton ""Ham"" Johnson and his 'Confederate' circle of friends; including TV preacher Jimmy Lee Farnsworth and a dodgy chemical plant.—KGF Vissers Fletch is a reporter for a Los Angeles newspaper, but he acts more like a detective. When an obscure relative leaves him a Louisiana mansion in his will, Fletch is naturally curious. Arriving in Louisiana, events occur that make him suspect that all is not well, and there is more to the property than he has been led to believe.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> When Irvin ""Fletch"" Fletcher inherits ""Bell Isle"", a Louisiana estate, he quits his job at the paper and takes off to live like a king.

In addition, the young and attractive lawyer he takes to bed that night does not wake up the next morning. After being released from prison, Fletch starts investigating about the murder, an enormous sum of money offered for his rather worthless piece of land, about TV priest Jimmy Lee Farnsworth and his Bibleland and about tons of toxic waste on his ground. Additionally, someone is after Fletch with a serious gun pointed at him. But they all underestimated Fletch, whose journalistic instinct always leads him into the right direction - hopefully.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> Fletch fans rejoice! The reckless I.M. Fletcher, investigative reporter, returns to the screen. This time, the chameleon-like reporter ventures to Belle Isle, a sprawling 80-acre Louisiana plantation which Fletch inherits from his aunt. Trouble begins when a lovely attorney mysteriously turns up dead, a neighborly lawyer warns him to leave town, and a ravishing real estate agent comes calling with a persistent offer he may not be able to refuse. Fletch must unravel the reasons for the mad land scramble with his trademark bag of hilarious disguises.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> The story opens with Los Angeles Times investigative reporter, Irwin M. Fletcher (Chevy Chase) dressed in drag as a waitress at a Greek restaurant. He is there getting a story about a gambling ring that is run out of the restaurant and barely makes it out unharmed when his cover is blown. When he gets back to the office with the story, his boss is happy with it, but denies Fletch a vacation he promised him, saying he needs to finish another story first.Angry, Fletch takes a phone call; it's an attorney from Louisiana calling to tell Fletch that his great aunt has died and left him her plantation - ""Belle Isle"". Fletch immediately quits his job and tells his boss to send his stuff to ""his mansion in Louisiana"". He flies down, and the attorney, the attractive Amanda Ross (Patricia Kalember) takes him to see the plantation, which is dilapidated, having been plainly neglected for years. Fletch wisecracks that with a little spackling and napalm it would make a nice mausoleum. They go in the house and Fletch meets the caretaker, ""Calculus Entropy"" (Cleavon Little). He worked for Fletch's aunt and wants to continue on with Fletch. The caretaker doesn't seem quite the simpleton that he makes out though.Fletch's attorney takes him back to town to sign papers and make him dinner. She informs him that someone wants to buy his property for $225,000.00. Fletch is immediately suspicious and tells her ""no sale"". They hit it off and end up spending the night together. While they are both sleeping, someone comes into the house and kills the attorney. Fletch wakes up in the morning to find her dead. The police come and they question Fletch about the death. The chief of police decides to arrest Fletch, not for murder, but for ""pissing him off"". Fletch is taken to the jail and put in a cell with a transvestite necrophiliac named Ben Dover (Randall 'Tex' Cobb), who threatens to molest him. Fletch is saved by another attorney - Hamilton ""Ham"" Johnson (Hal Holbrook), who gets Ben out of jail. Fletch asks the new attorney to take his case, and he does. He gets Fletch released and they leave.Fletch goes back to his house and talks to Calculus. They sit on the porch to relax, but the KKK shows up chanting over a bullhorn but only giving a half-hearted demonstration. Fletch puts on a couple of white sheets and joins them - telling them his name is ""Henry Himmler."" He finds out that they are not there on their own, but are on a ""contract job"" - someone hired them to get rid of some ""undesirable carpetbagger"" - presumably Fletch. Calculus runs them off with a shotgun while Fletch screams at them in Zulu gibberish.The next morning, a real estate agent - Becky Ann Culpepper (Julianne Phillips) comes to put another offer on Fletch's property. This time it's up to $250,000.00. Fletch asks her who is offering the money and she tells him that it's a confidential buyer. Fletch decides to do some snooping, so he goes back to Amanda Ross's house, disguising himself as an exterminator. He finds out that there are others involved in the mystery of his aunt's estate - televangelist Jimmy Lee Farnsworth (R. Lee Ermey) and a mysterious corporation by the name of ""Bluebird"". The police catch him there, but he talks his way out of it by telling them he's searching for microscopic termites with a voracious appetite for human flesh. He leaves and goes back to the plantation and talks to Calculus about the Reverend and finds out that he is a local icon with his television show and ""Bibleland"" amusement park. Fletch decides to check his business dealings as a lead.He goes to a live taping of the television show the next day and is called up front by the Reverend to ""confess his sins"" and ""be saved"". Fletch makes friends with the Reverend and learns that he wants Fletch's property to expand Bibleland. The next day, Fletch goes to talk to Ham and finds out that he has been cleared of the murder charges and that Amanda's death has been ruled to be from natural causes. The attorney confesses that the reason Fletch has been cleared is because of his ""religious conversion"" on the Reverend's show. Ham also tells Fletch that the good reverend is a scam artist who tricked Ham's own mother out of her land and plantation.Fletch goes fishing that afternoon with Calculus and they discuss the possibility that Amanda's death was natural. They both agree that it's very improbable, and Fletch decides that he needs to get a look at Amanda's body to know for sure. He asks Calculus to help him get into the morgue. He puts Fletch on a gurney under a sheet and takes him in. The morgue operator is Ben Dover. He takes Fletch's prize Laker watch. Calculus tells him that Fletch's name is ""Eldridge Cleaver"" (the great civil rights leader) so we know that Calculus isn't as ignorant as he lets on. Once they get back into the morgue, Fletch checks for Amanda's body, but it has already been cremated. Fletch is convinced that she was murdered and cremated quickly to cover it up. Fletch goes on the hunt for her murderer.After the morgue, Calculus and he go back to Belle Isle and there's a fire and the mansion burns down. Fletch has to move in with Calculus. Later they go out to eat so they can talk. While at the restaurant they run into some friends. They offer to take Fletch ""coon hunting"" and he goes. While running around the Louisiana marsh at night, they go across several properties that were recently sold to the mysterious ""Bluebird"" corporation. The properties are barren and have puddles of sludge around. Fletch steps in one. As he is checking this out, someone shoots at him. He ducks and runs toward the shooter and gets in a struggle with him. Another gunshot scares off the first shooter, and Fletch finds himself alone...but, on the ground he finds his Laker watch. He goes back to Calculus' house and tells him he was shot at and he goes to check out Calculus' shotgun to see if it's been used recently, but Calculus grabs the gun off the wall before Fletch can touch it and goes outside. We hear a shot and Calculus tells Fletch that he thought he saw something and shot in the air to scare it away.In the morning, Fletch starts to put on his sneakers and finds that the soles have been eaten away by the sludge he stepped in during the hunt. Fletch decides it's time for some outside help. He calls his boss back in California. He finds out that Becky Culpepper - the real estate agent is the Reverend Farnsworth's daughter, and he sends his sneakers to his boss to have them analyzed. The next morning he goes to see Becky and asks if the $250,000 offer is still good. It isn't. He confronts her with the information he received about her paternity and she admits that the Reverend is her father, but that she doesn't believe he's a murderer.Fletch decides it's time to go back to Bibleland and check out the Rev. Farnsworth some more. He dresses up and goes onto the show disguised as a ""faith-healer."" He sneaks backstage and checks out the computers. He finds out how the Reverend knows how to call specific people out of the audience - he has a computerized system and someone who tells him names and specifics in an earpiece during the show. He also finds out that the Rev. Farnsworth has plans that would expand Bibleland to all of the neighboring plantations, not just his. Fletch gets rid of the computer operator and checks the files. He sees that the Reverend wasn't trying to buy the properties, but another mysterious corporation named ""Everest Development"" was. Still in disguise, Fletch is called onto the show and makes a dramatic showing of his ability to heal a member of the audience.Knowing he needs more information, Fletch decides to start with Ben Dover since he was the one that was shooting at him. He follows Ben from the morgue to a biker bar. Fletch dresses up as ""Ed Harley"", goes into the bar and claims to be the owner of Harley Davidson Motorcycles, suddenly becoming a hero among the bikers. Ben doesn't recognize him, and offers to let him go on a ride with his gang. Fletch does - with Becky on the back of his motorcycle. During the ride, Fletch's fake mustache comes off and Ben recognizes him. They give chase, but Becky and he get away. They go back to her house to clean up. While there, Fletch calls his boss in California and finds out that the sludge that ate his sneakers is produced in only one place by a corporation named Bluebird. There is only one location near Louisiana, in Mississippi. Fletch goes to check it out.In Mississippi, Fletch poses as the bellicose representative of Everest Development and talks to the Bluebird factory foreman (Phil Hartman). He finds out that Belle Isle is scheduled to receive a large shipment of the toxic waste in a few weeks. He also finds out from the paperwork there who the ""owner"" of Everest is.Fletch goes back to Louisiana and crashes a party thrown by Hamilton Johnson. He tells him that he wants to talk to him privately. When they get upstairs, Fletch tells him that he knows that he is the one who tried to buy his land, killed Amanda, framed him, and has planned a shipment of toxic waste for Belle Isle. Ham then admits to everything - saying he hates Jimmy Lee Farnsworth for what he did to Ham's beloved ""mamma"". He says he wanted to turn everything around Bibleland into a toxic waste dump to ruin the reverend. Ham pulls a gun and tells Fletch that he's going to kill him. Fletch tells Ham that he left all of the incriminating evidence with Becky and if he doesn't let Fletch go, she'll tell it all on air in her father's show. Ham tells Fletch that he's bluffing - and out walks Ben, who has kidnapped Becky. Ham has ordered both of them to be murdered. Fletch is stuck... until he gets an idea. He picks up a picture of Ham's mom and begins insulting her, infuriating Ham. Fletch grabs the urn with Ham's mother's ashes and begins playing with them. He tosses them across the room at Ham, prompting Ben and Ham to fall trying to catch the urn, allowing Fletch and Becky to escape. They run to Bibleland and into a live taping of the Reverend's show, leaving Ben trapped in the Tunnel of Love ride. Ham comes in with his gun and tries to shoot Fletch, but the Reverend gets in between them and tells Ham he'll have to shoot him first. Just then, shots ring out and Ham goes down... the FBI is there and have killed Ham... the FBI agent in charge is Calculus...whose real name is Agent Goldstein. Goldstein has been leading an investigation of the ministry for months. They all go outside and talk about things a bit... Fletch tells Calculus that he knew he wasn't a backwoods simpleton all along. The Reverend says he's going to rerun the show with the shooting incident every day for Sweeps month. Fletch kisses Becky and mentions the possibility of her coming back to California with him.When Fletch gets back to California and his job at the Times newspaper, there's a big party for him, celebrating his story about Bluebird and the toxic waste dumping. His boss has given him a raise and a corner office. Fletch also receives an insurance check for $100,000 for the fire at Belle Isle. The toxic waste had however already been dumped there. Just then, Fletch's ex-wife's attorney shows up and says that Fletch's ex-wife wants half of the property in Louisiana as part of the alimony. He tells Fletch if he'll sign over the property, that they'll leave him alone for the rest of his life. Fletch gladly does... pretending it's killing him to do it... and never telling the attorney that the plantation is now a toxic waste dump with a burned-down home. Fletch smiles widely at the audience."
Licence to Kill,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097742/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A vengeful James Bond goes rogue to infiltrate and take down the organization of a drug lord who has murdered his friend's new wife and left him near death.

As a result, the fearless British spy embarks on a private vendetta right under the nose of Her Majesty's government, operating on both sides of the law. In the meantime, as the sadistic drug kingpin implements his dangerous master plan, unexpected allies lend a hand in Bond's savage campaign. However, no one is safe from harm. As Bond places friendship above duty, the question arises.

James sets off on a personal vendetta against the drug lord, and arrives in Mexico City. Helped by cocky and beautiful CIA agent and pilot Pam Bouvier, Sanchez's sexy mistress Lupe Lamora, and Bond's friend and fellow quartermaster 'Q'. Bond plays on both sides of the law, as he infiltrates his organization by bringing Sanchez down. Where 007 embarks in the ultimate confrontation and he will not rest until he kills Sanchez and those responsible for torturing Felix and murdering Della.—Daniel Williamson James Bond (Timothy Dalton) is on leave in Florida to serve as best man at the wedding of Felix Leiter (David Hedison) and Della Churchill (Priscilla Barnes). With Cold War tensions cooling down, Leiter has transferred to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and he's spent the last several months attempting to capture elusive drug kingpin Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi). He is considered one of the most ruthless drug lords around, operating an invisible empire that stretches all the way from Alaska to Chile, and he's proven impossible to catch, having managed to kill, intimidate or bribe every major politician in the Western Hemisphere who could give him up.As Bond, Leiter, and Leiter's fishing buddy Sharkey (Frank McRae) drive to the wedding, Leiter's boss, Hawkins (Grand L. Bush) intercepts them to inform Leiter that Sanchez is making a rare visit to Cray Key. The timetable to capture him before he can flee to non-extradition territory is tight, so Leiter decides to take it. Bond accompanies him aboard a Coast Guard helicopter, ""strictly as an observer,"" to ensure that he will be back on time, and alive, for the wedding, leaving Sharkey to stall the proceedings until they get back.Sanchez has ventured north of his territory because he'd found out that his mistress Lupe Lamora (Talisa Soto) is having an affair with another man. Sanchez and his three menacing henchmen, Dario (Benicio Del Toro), Perez (Alejandro Bracho), and Braun (Guy De Saint Cyr), creep up to the house where the boyfriend is staying, then burst in and catch Lupe in bed with her new lover. Dario, Perez and Braun grab the boyfriend and take him outside, where they kill him and cut out his heart, while Sanchez himself punishes Lupe by whipping her with the tail of a stingray.Bond and Leiter arrive just as Sanchez is preparing to fly out of US territory. After a short gunfight, he separates from his henchmen and Lupe, and flies off alone via a private plane. Bond and Leiter catch up to Sanchez in a Coast Guard helicopter. Bond is lowered on a cable and manages to attach the helicopter's tow cable to Sanchez's plane in flight and pulling it out of the air. Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church in time for the ceremony.During the reception, Bond finds Leiter finishing up a meeting in his office with another woman, Pamela Bouvier, (Carey Lowell), but she leaves before Bond can speak with her. Della offers Bond a gift, a silver-handled cigarette lighter with the engraving, ""Love always, Della and Felix."" Della tells Bond that he will need to get married next, causing Bond great discomfort. Della asks her new husband if it was something she said, and Felix tells her that Bond hadOn Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), but it ended tragically.Meanwhile, Sanchez is taken to a holding cell in Key West, awaiting transfer to a higher security facility. Hawkins and another agent, Ed Killifer (Everett McGill), tell Sanchez that he is looking at least ten life sentences from all the felonies he's wanted for; his dream team attorneys and ""million dollar bribes"" will not get him out of this one. Sanchez offers $2 million for anyone who helps him escape. Though Killifer seems disgusted at the offer, Sanchez believes he has taken the bait.Indeed, Killifer does accept the $2 million offer and agrees to help Sanchez escape custody. To do so, he arranges to ride shotgun in the van that is going to take Sanchez to Quantico. As the convoy crosses Key West's Seven Mile Bridge, the driver becomes visibly nervous as they pass road construction signs warning of repaving work going on up ahead. Killifer uses the butt of his shotgun to knock the driver unconscious, then steers the van over the side of the bridge and into the ocean. Once the van sinks, and the driver drowns, frogmen stationed below the bridge load Sanchez and Killifer into a Shark Hunter submersible and transport them to the Ocean Exotica, a warehouse owned Milton Krest, (Anthony Zerbe) a marine breeder who operates a research boat, the Wavekrest, as a front for Sanchez's drug trade.Unaware of Sanchez's liberation, Felix and Della return home, only to find Dario, Perez and Braun waiting for them. They knock Leiter out, and then rape and murder Della. Leiter is driven to the Ocean Exotica, where Sanchez and his henchmen are waiting for him. Killifer apologizes for betraying Leiter, but insists he couldn't refuse the money. Sanchez's men open a trap door, revealing a feeding pit for a Great White shark. As Leiter is lowered into the pit, Sanchez tells him that he will not die this day, for there are some things that are worse than death, and Leiter's fate is nothing personal, just business.Bond learns of Sanchez's liberation the next day, when he notices the police at the airport on high alert as he prepares to leave for a posting in Istanbul, Turkey. Realizing what's going on, Bond races back to Leiter's house, finding Della sprawled on the bed in the bedroom, dead, then finds Felix on the couch in his office, wrapped in a tarp. The room has been ransacked and Leiter's files have been stolen. After a few moments of Bond looking over him in despair, Leiter wakes up: his torture from the shark hasn't killed him. Hawkins calls to check up on Leiter, and Bond tells him to call an ambulance.Leiter is rushed to the hospital and put into surgery. His left leg has to be amputated below the knee, and there is a 50/50 chance that he will also lose his left arm. Hawkins tells Bond that the authorities' hands are tied regarding Sanchez, as he has already fled to the Republica de Isthmus (based on the real life Panama), which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States.The local authorities believe that Leiter's injuries are the result of a chainsaw, but Sharkey knows a shark bite when he sees one. The two of them visit aquariums in the area, looking for the shark that Leiter was fed to. Eventually, they locate the Ocean Exotica. Krest tells them that the facility has the capacity to house a Great White, but it was sold years ago, so they now concentrate on breeding smaller fish to feed the world's hungry. After a cursory examination, Bond realizes he's in the right place, noticing the flowers from Felix' wedding boutonniere on the floor, as well as traces of dried blood.That night, Bond and Sharkey infiltrate the Ocean Exotica, splitting up to cover more ground. Killifer has been ordered to hide here until Krest's flagship, the Wavekrest, can pick him up. Bond finds that Sanchez is smuggling packages of cocaine in the maggots Krest uses for his fish, but is discovered and has to take out two guards. The ensuing scuffle gives Killifer a chance to ambush him. Keeping his Magnum trained on Bond, Killifer opens the feeding pit. Before he can shoot Bond or usher him into the tank, he is knocked off balance by Sharkey, who emerges from another trap door directly below him. Bond seizes the opportunity and knocks him into the feeding pit. Killifer grabs onto a rope above the water, and motions to the briefcase holding his bribe money; if Bond saves him, he can have half of it. Bond throws the briefcase at him, dropping him in the water, where he is promptly eaten by the shark. Sharkey deems it a terrible waste....of money.The next morning, Hawkins confronts Bond over his recent actions, which have violated several local laws. He summons two nearby MI6 agents, telling Bond that he is in over his head, and this is where it ends. The MI6 agents take Bond to the Hemingway House in Key West, where M (Robert Brown) is waiting for him. M chastises Bond for his unprofessional attitude, insisting the Leiter knew that risks of the job, and Sanchez is outside their jurisdiction. Bond insists that the Americans will not do anything about Sanchez, but M considers this irrelevant, since they have not requested MI6's help on this matter. When Bond threatens to resign, M suspends him and immediately revokes his license to kill. Bond flees from MI6 custody and becomes a rogue agent.With Sharkey's help, Bond learns that the Wavekrest is out to sea to test an automated submersible prototype, Sentinel. Bond boards the ship and finds Lupe sleeping in the captain's quarters. She tells him that Sanchez is not on board, and she doesn't know where he is. She covers for Bond (at knifepoint) when Krest checks up on her, and suggests that Bond leave before he gets them both killed. They then hear a commotion coming from outside. Bond and Lupe look out the window and see a patrol boat rendezvousing with the Wavekrest, displaying Sharkey's dead body like a trophy. The patrol leader, Clive, tells Krest that he caught Sharkey snooping around where he shouldn't have been, and jokes about Sharkey's poor choice of nickname. Lupe is disgusted, but Bond reminds her that she chose to be a drug lord's mistress. Bond escapes from the Wavekrest by shooting Clive and stealing his scuba gear. Krest is using Sentinel to smuggle drugs to Sanchez's distributors, who have arrived via seaplane. Still underwater, Bond sabotages Sentinel before making his escape on one of the seaplanes, stealing $5 million on the way.Knowing that he will need allies to carry out his operation against Sanchez, Bond breaks into Leiter's house and uses his computer to find a list of informants who have infiltrated Sanchez's empire. Only one of them is still alive, an ex-military pilot by the name of Pamela Bouvier. He meets Bouvier at a Bimini bar, recognizing her as the woman from Leiter's wedding reception. Their conversation is interrupted when Dario arrives at the bar. Bouvier explains Dario used to be with the Nicaraguan contras before he was expelled for his sociopathic tendencies. She tells Bond to keep quiet and let her and her shotgun do the talking. Dario claims to want to hire her for a smuggling job, but she knows that it is a setup for her to be killed. Bond and Bouvier start a barroom brawl in order to escape, and they fight their way to Bond's speedboat. Dario pulls out a Magnum revolver and fires at them, eventually hitting Bouvier in the back. She is unharmed due to the Kevlar vest she's wearing. Once they are a safe distance away, Bond asks Bouvier to fly him to Isthmus City. Bouvier warns that it will not be cheap. In addition to her fee of $100,000, Bond will have to throw around some serious money to make his presence felt in the city.In London, Miss Moneypenny (Caroline Bliss) tells M that she has not found any indication that Bond has left the United States. M tells her that she should know better, Bond is going after Sanchez alone, without support from the Americans or any other agency, and it is a diplomatic incident waiting to happen. They have an agent in Isthmus City, and he is to receive regular updates. After M leaves, Moneypenny calls Q Branch.Bond and Bouvier travel to Isthmus City, renting a room at the luxurious Casino de Isthmus hotel. Bouvier decides to stay with Bond, posing as Ms. Kennedy, his ""executive secretary."" She directs Bond to deposit the $5 million he stole from the Wavekrest into a bank which launders Sanchez's drug money, then alters her appearance by getting a conservative haircut and high end clothing, to better fit the part. Sanchez is currently arranging a summit with Triad Dragon Heads (bosses) that he wishes to do business with. He also has a complicated moneymaking scheme involving a phony meditation retreat, the Olympatec Meditation Institute, run by an American televangelist, Professor Joe Butcher (Wayne Newton), who solicits ""donations"" that are actually the market prices for drugs Sanchez smuggles out of a distribution facility that the meditation institute is a front for.Bond makes his presence felt by playing blackjack at the casino, bringing $250,000 to the table. Sanchez, who is watching via security cameras, tells the casino staff to let him play when he notices how much money he has. Bond easily beats the pit bosses, but Lupe is dispatched by Sanchez to put an end to his winning streak. Bond is brought before Sanchez and meets two more of his associates, his head of security, Colonel Heller (Don Stroud), and his accountant, Truman Lodge (Anthony Starke). Bond claims that he is there to look for work, during the conversation he studies the office for any weakness in security, noting a building across the street that appears to be closed for renovations. Sanchez's interest is piqued, but he remains guarded, warning Bond that no one saw him coming into his hotel, so nobody has to see him come out. He allows Bond to leave, but confiscates his gun and passport, implying that they will be returned once Heller's background check is complete.After he is returned to his hotel room, Bond tells Bouvier that the windows in Sanchez's office are high grade bulletproof plexiglass, so regular weapons will be useless against it. They receive a surprise visitor in the form of Q (Desmond Llewelyn). Moneypenny has informed him of Bond's situation, and he wants to help. He is currently on leave, so it is entirely unofficial. He provides Bond with plastic explosive and a sniper rifle (that is disguised as a camera) with an optical palm readout that ensures that only Bond can fire it.Bond sneaks to the roof of the hotel and uses a grappling line to rappel down, planting plastic explosives in the window of Sanchez's office and adjoining conference room. Inside, Sanchez tells the Triad leaders that they can become a part of his ""franchise"" if they pay him $100 million. He has already devised reasonable distribution deals based on a case-by-case basis on the size of each Triad's gang and the territory they control. The sole holdout is a man named Kwang (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), who wants to see Sanchez's main distribution center. Truman Lodge protests, but Kwang reminds him that $100 million is a serious investment, and the other Triads agree. Sanchez reluctantly acquiesces to their wishes, then directs them to a roomful of callgirls. Once the Triads leave, Sanchez tells Heller that they need to keep an eye on Kwang.Bond heads toward the closed building and sets up a sniper's nest. He curiously sees Bouvier talking with Heller in one of the other rooms. After she leaves, Bond detonates the explosives, destroying the glass. However, before he can fire a fatal shot, he is disarmed by a team of ninjas. Though he puts up a strong fight, they eventually overpower him. They take him to their hideout, where he meets Kwang and another MI6 agent, Fallon (Christopher Neame). As Bond is placed in restraints, Kwang reveals that he is an undercover agent for Hong Kong Narcotics, planning a major sting operation inside Sanchez's operation, but Bond's assassination attempt will likely mean that Sanchez and the Triads will go underground. Fallon assures Kwang that Bond's actions were not authorized by his government, and he will be brought back to England to account for his actions. As Fallon prepares a sedative, Sanchez's troops, led by Heller, bombard the safehouse with artillery. Fallon is killed right away, and Kwang is severely wounded. Kwang then commits suicide with a cyanide capsule before Sanchez can interrogate him (out of frustration, Sanchez shoots Kwang's body several times). The soldiers find Bond unconscious, but alive, and Sanchez orders him to be taken to his private island.Bond awakens in a spacious guest bedroom, and Sanchez asks him why he was at Kwang's safehouse. Bond spins an elaborate fabrication that plays on Sanchez's existing paranoia, successfully convincing him that Kwang's team were an elite mercenary unit hired to kill Sanchez that thought Bond would be a threat because of his old loyalties. They seemed well-enough informed to suggest a security leak in Sanchez's organization. Sanchez insists that this is impossible, but after Bond leaves, he tells Heller they may have a problem with Krest. Lupe smuggles Bond off the island during one of her ""shopping trips"" to the mainland. After returning to the hotel, Bond confronts Bouvier about her meeting with Heller. She reveals that Sanchez bought Stinger missiles from the Contras, which he would threaten to use in terrorist attacks on American targets unless the DEA stopped pursuing him. Leiter had offered Heller amnesty if he helped get the Stingers back. However, Bond's assassination attempt scared him into backing out of the deal.That night, the Wavekrest docks, and Sanchez is there to greet it, accompanied by Lupe, Perez, and Braun. Bouvier disguises herself as the Wavecrest's new helmsman, to give Bond time to infiltrate the boat underwater, then crashes the boat into the dock. She rendezvous with Bond in the aft section, strips down to a one-piece swimsuit, then helps Bond plant the $5 million he had stolen into the decompression chamber. Sanchez questions Krest about the Sentinel incident. He has brought Lupe with him, as he has found that Krest cannot lie in front of her. Perez and Braun set out to find a safe, eventually discovering the planted money in the decompression chamber. Furious at the apparent betrayal, Sanchez locks Krest in the chamber and then rapidly depressurizes it, causing his head to explode. Sanchez orders Perez and Braun to clean the money (in more ways than one). Bond and Bouvier rendezvous with Q, who has disguised himself as a fisherman. Bond tells them they need to part company, as the authorities will be looking for them now. Unbeknownst to either of them, Bond has returned to Sanchez, being welcomed into his inner circle for his perceived loyalty.The next morning, Lupe visits Bouvier and Q, revealing that Bond lied to them on the dock, he spent the night at Sanchez's estate, and slept with her. Bond thinks that he has earned Sanchez's trust, but Sanchez isn't stupid, and has Bond placed under intense scrutiny. It is only a matter of time before he is discovered, so she wants him extracted before that happens. Bouvier is furious, but cooler heads prevail, and she and Q devise a plan.Sanchez takes Bond to his distribution center, built underneath the Olympatec Meditation Institute. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in gasoline and then sell it disguised as fuel to the Triads. The re-integration process where the cocaine is extracted from the gasoline will be available after Sanchez receives the second half of his franchising fee. Unbeknownst to Bond, Dario has joined Sanchez, bringing the Stingers and two rocket launchers with him.Meanwhile, Bouvier has made her way to the OMI by disguising herself as a student. She seduces Professor Joe, then steals a key to gain access to the distribution center.During Sanchez's presentation, Dario recognizes Bond from the bar fight and tells Sanchez that Bond is their enemy. Bond headbutts Dario and starts a fire in the lab, but he is overpowered and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the brick-cocaine into a giant strawcutter. Before Sanchez can lower Bond into the strawcutter, Heller tells them that the fire is beyond their control, they need to move all their merchandise. Sanchez and most of his men leave to help Heller, while Dario hangs back to finish off Bond. Bouvier arrives and shoots Dario, allowing Bond to drop Dario into the strawcutter, which rips him apart.Amid the chaos, Heller attempts to load the Stingers into a helicopter. Sanchez orders they be moved to his car instead, and secretly orders Braun to kill Heller. Four articulated tanker trucks full of the cocaine/gasoline mixture are able to escape the compound before it is destroyed. Bond and Bouvier also escape, and use a plane to catch up with the convoy. Bond hijacks the first tanker, dislodging the trailer and using the cab to pursue the other vehicles. Sanchez decides to ""cut overhead"" by shooting Truman-Lodge, then gives Perez a rocket launcher and orders him to set up an ambush. Bond avoids Perez's rocket with some precision driving, and one of the other tankers is destroyed instead.As Bond closes in on the last tanker, Perez and Braun give chase in a pickup truck. However, during the ensuing chase, they drive through a wall of flame, setting their tires ablaze. They lose control of their vehicle, eventually plummeting off a cliff, narrowly avoiding Bouvier's plane. Sanchez fires a rocket at Bouvier's plane, grazing the tail and forcing her to make an emergency landing. Sanchez draws a machete and attacks Bond aboard the final remaining tanker, which loses control and crashes. As Bond crawls away, Sanchez, covered in gasoline, and still wielding his machete, overpowers him. Sanchez tells Bond he should have accepted his offer to join him, he could have had everything. Bond then reveals the engraved cigarette lighter, and sets Sanchez afire. Burning alive, Sanchez stumbles into the wrecked tanker truck's cistern and it explodes. Bouvier rescues Bond, driving the cab from one of the destroyed tankers.Later, a party is held at Sanchez's former residence. Bond receives a call from Leiter, who reveals that his doctors were able to save his arm, and he is planning on going fishing once it heals. He adds that he received a call from M, implying that all is forgiven in regards to MI6. Bond chooses to reject Lupe's advances, suggesting the country's president as a better match, and romances Bouvier instead."
Lean on Me,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097722/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The dedicated but tyrannical Joe Clark is appointed the principal of a decaying inner-city school he is determined to improve by any and all means. An arrogant and unorthodox teacher returns as principal to the idyllic high school from which he had earlier been fired to find it a den of drug abuse, gang violence, and urban despair. Eventually he is successful but unorthodox methods lead to a clash with city officials that threatens to undo all his efforts. Based on a true story.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> When a school in Paterson, New Jersey, has less-than-average basic skills test scores, it faces the possibility of being taken over by the state. So the mayor asks the school superintendent for help, and he suggests that they appoint the controversial Joe Clark as the school principal. Clark begrudgingly agrees. And when he arrives, he shakes things up by reassigning teachers and calling all of them incompetent. And it isn't long before a lot of people want him out, but at the same time, he gains the respect of some of the teachers and the students.—rcs0411@yahoo.com African-American history teacher Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman) instructs enthusiastic teenagers at Eastside High School in 1967 Paterson, New Jersey. His class is interrupted by fellow African-American teacher Frank Napier (Robert Guillaume), who alerts Joe that their union is holding a meeting without them. Joe interrupts the meeting and demands to know what is going on. Other union members criticize Joe's antics and reveal that they have accepted a raise and agreed to transfer Joe to another school.Twenty years later in present day 1987, Eastside High has devolved into crime-ridden chaos. Dr. Frank Napier, now the Superintendent of Paterson's school district, tells Mayor Don Bottman (Alan North) that a new bill has just passed requiring schools to achieve a 75% passing grade on a basic skills test administered to all students. If a school does not pass, the state of New Jersey will take it over. Frank informs Bottman that only 38% of Eastside's students passed the test the previous year, and suggests Joe Clark take over as the new principal. Although Bottman is wary of the idea, he approves, and Frank visits Joe at the elementary school where he works. Despite Joe's initial resistance, Frank persuades him to take the job, insisting this is Joe's chance to make a difference in the world.On his first day at Eastside, Joe immediately shows his tyrannical side when she shouts at the department heads for no reason, demands that nobody speak during the meetings he holds, and requests the names of every hoodlum, drug dealer, misfit and miscreant in the student body by noon. At an all-school assembly, the troublemakers whose names were submitted are called to the stage. Joe addresses the rowdy crowd, who finally take notice when he expels the 100 or more students onstage and they are ushered out by security. Joe tells the remaining students they could be expelled just as easily, and informs them that a practice exam for the basic skills test will be administered in two weeks. They have 110 days before the actual test, and he warns that their futures will depend on it.Parents call an emergency meeting that night. Leona Barrett (Lynne Thigpen), a local community activist whose trouble-making son was one of those expelled that morning, accuses Joe of denying deserving kids an education. Joe stands by his decision, preaching about the responsibility he feels in his new position, and many of the parents applaud him. Leona angrily leaves and vows to destroy JoeThe next morning, a freshman named Thomas Sams (Jermaine Hopkins), who was expelled for skipping class and smoking crack cocaine, pleads with Joe to let him return, claiming he was accused of crimes he did not commit. Joe does not believe him but allows the boy another chance, promising to follow his every move.At Joe's insistence, the school's graffiti-covered walls are repainted, and the cages surrounding the food counter in the cafeteria are removed. At lunch, Joe stops Thomas from stealing another student's food, then humiliates him by demanding he and his friends sing the school song while everyone else remains silent. The boys do not know the song, and Joe announces a new rule that every student must learn the song and be prepared to sing it on command. Joe goes to the classroom of Mrs. Elliott (Robin Bartlett), the chorus teacher, to inform her that she must teach the song to the entire student body. When she refuses to interrupt the song her students are singing, Joe summons her into the hall and fires her for insubordination. He later suspends Mr. Darnell (Michael Beach), an English teacher and assistant football coach, for disrespecting him in the cafeteria, and Ms. Joan Levias (Beverly Todd), the vice principal, warns Joe that he has caused chaos.After the practice exam is administered, Joe demands Levias track down the results when they do not arrive soon enough. Two students alert him that a fight has broken out and he runs to the scene. There, Joe finds a drug dealer, one of the students he expelled, attacking a student named Kid Ray (Alex Romaguera). Learning that the drug dealer snuck in through a side door, Joe demands that security chain all the side entrances closed, despite fire codes.Later, Joe sees Kaneesha Carter (Karen Malina White), a student he taught in elementary school, stewing in the hallway outside his office. When he asks Kaneesha what is wrong, she reveals that her mother has kicked her out of the house. Joe and Levias escort Kaneesha home after school to tell Mrs. Carter what a good student she is. Mrs. Carter reveals that she gave birth to Kaneesha when she was only 15-years-old, and later developed a drug problem. Now that she is getting sober, she does not like herself and thought Kaneesha would be better off without her. Joe offers to help find Mrs. Carter a job, and she agrees to take her daughter back in.A local newspaper refers to Joe as ""Crazy Joe Clark"" and accuses him of fighting with his student's parents. Frank warns him that he stands to alienate his students and staff the way he alienated his wife, and forces him to reinstate Mr. Darnell, who, as a young, African-American male teacher, provides a good role model for Eastside students.Fire Chief Gaines (John Ring) arrives at the school for a surprise inspection, but Joe demands he file an official request and sends him away. Soon after, Kid Ray informs Joe that he is quitting school. Guessing that Ray is selling drugs, Joe warns the boy that he will be dead in a year. He sees Thomas and his friends roaming the halls and demands to hear the school song. They sing a beautiful, new arrangement of the song and inform him that the new chorus teacher, Mrs. Powers, taught it to them. Joe finds Mrs. Powers and pretends to be angry before congratulating her on the new arrangement and declaring it Eastside's new alma mater.The practice exam results finally arrive, revealing that only 33% of Eastside students passed. Joe addresses the teachers, telling them it is their failure, and demands that a new peer-tutoring program be instituted. Students begin to thrive under Joe's rigid disciplinary tactics, and he becomes more cheerful around them. Meanwhile, the angry Leona Barrett crusades to have Joe fired, and makes a deal to back Bottman's next mayoral campaign if he agrees to oust the principal at her behest. Having learned that Joe has chained the side entrances to the school, they conspire to send Fire Chief Gaines back for an inspection.Frank and Mr. Rosenberg (Ethan Phillips), the school district attorney, come to Eastside to warn Joe about the plan. When several students approach Joe with their problems at the same time, Ms. Levias tries to get Joe's attention but he shouts at her. She later accuses him of being an egomaniac who takes sole credit for the work of his entire staff, and asks to be transferred to a different school.On the day of the basic skills test, Joe gives the students a pep talk and gives a knowing nod to Ms. Levias as he stresses the importance of teamwork. Ms. Powers performs the song ""Lean on Me,"" and the students join her, prompting Ms. Levias to crumple the transfer request Joe handed her that morning. Later that day, Fire Chief Gaines arrives, accompanied by Barrett, and Joe is arrested for breaking the law by chaining fire exits.That night, Leona Barrett addresses the school board at City Hall, demanding Joe's termination and imprisonment. Inside his jail cell, Joe hears his students walking up the streets, protesting his arrest. They congregate outside City Hall, and Barrett addresses them through a megaphone, urging them to go home. Mayor Bottman releases Joe from his cell to address the students, but they refuse to leave when he asks them to do so. Ms. Levias arrives with a piece of paper and demands that Joe read it. He then gleefully announces that Eastside has passed the basic skills test. The students rejoice. Sometime later, Joe shakes his students' hands as they accept their diplomas at graduation."

Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partners, Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed and arrange it to look like a murder-suicide. However, after Bernie leaves the gangsters decide Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his grabbiness as well as his fooling around with a girlfriend of one of the mobsters, and order that he be killed instead.Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and speaks to the hitman Paulie (Don Calfa) on the phone, planning the murders and establishing an alibi, unaware the conversation is being recorded on Bernie's answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, injects Bernie with a fatal overdose, then plants heroin on him. When Larry and Richard arrive at the beach house, they find their boss's body. Before they can call the police, however, guests arrive for a party that is a regular event at Bernie's house every weekend.

Road House,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A tough bouncer is hired to tame a dirty bar. Serene and laconic but powerful and lethal, expert martial artist Dalton is the best professional bouncer in the business. With his reputation preceding him, Dalton arrives in Jasper, Missouri, to clean up The Double Deuce, a seedy bar terrorised by troublemakers. However, Dalton is unaware that villainous local entrepreneur Brad Wesley wants things to stay as they are. As a result, the newcomer gets a deep stab wound from Wesley's hired goons, catching charming physician Dr Elizabeth Clay's eye. For this alone, corrupt Wesley has enough reason to get rid of Dalton at all costs. But a bouncer like Dalton always has the final say.—Nick Riganas Dalton is an expert ""cooler,"" a bar-room bouncer who can break up fights without getting himself killed in the process. Frank Tilghman, the owner of the Double Deuce in Jasper, Missouri, has hired Dalton away from a bar in New York City, because Tilghman needs someone who can handle the nightly outbreaks of violence at the Double Deuce, and teach the rest of the Double Deuce's bouncers how to handle it. Dalton is injured on a fight and is treated by Elizabeth ""Doc"" Clay, the local doctor. Dalton and Doc soon fall in love with each other, and this angers Brad Wesley, a crime boss. Wesley is out to get rid of Dalton.—Daniel Poniatowski When it becomes too violent at the Double Deuce road house, the club owner hires Dalton, a professional ""cooler"" (head bouncer) to clean it up. But Dalton's early successes and budding romance with the local doctor enrages Wesley, the town crime boss. When Dalton continues to defy him, the stage is set for a dramatic confrontation that will test Dalton's limits and decide the fate of the town.—R. Huston The story opens at a bar called Bandstand in an unidentified town. A limo pulls up and a tall gentleman steps out and is allowed to enter the place after showing the bouncer at the door his business card. Inside, he finds the bar is very lively - lots of customers drinking and dancing, a band playing loud, bluesy rock and lots of cash being taken in by the bartenders. Nearby is a man named Dalton, the head bouncer or ""cooler,"" who carefully watches over the crowd and the bouncers. When a small fight breaks out involving three of the bouncers, he approaches the customer who started the brawl and tells him and his friend they should leave. The customer apologizes, saying they'll behave. Dalton turns around and the customer grabs a nearby knife and slashes Dalton on his upper arm. Dalton seems unfazed, especially when the customer says he wants to fight him. Dalton tells him ""Outside."" When they're outside, Dalton smiles and leaves them there with five of the biggest bouncers guarding the door.Back inside the club, the tall businessman introduces himself to Dalton, who is stitching up the wound he'd just received. The man's name is Tilghman and he wants to hire Dalton to help him clean up a bar he'd just bought outside of Kansas City. Just after Tilghman bought the place, it attracted a violent crowd. Dalton tells him he'll work for him for $5000 up front, $500 a night and that when the bar is cleaned up, he can leave. Tilghman gladly accepts the offer and hands Dalton a plane ticket. Dalton turns it down, saying he thinks flying's too dangerous. Dalton goes to a local parking garage driving an old clunky 1964 Buick Riviera and tosses the keys to the attendant, telling the old man to keep the car if he wants it. In the garage, he takes the cover off his real car, a 1986 Mercedes 560, and drives out of town.Dalton arrives in Jasper, Missouri and goes directly to Tilghman's club, the Double Deuce. Before he enters the place, a large bouncer with a mean attitude, Morgan, violently tosses out a troublemaker. Inside, Dalton stands by the bar, waiting for Tilghman to arrive. One of the waitresses, Carrie, asks Dalton who he is and recognizes his name. Already something of a legend in the bouncing business, several of the other bouncers react with excitement at his presence. One of the bouncers says it's rumored that Dalton killed a man by tearing out his throat with his bare hand. Dalton remains passive, watching the club and seeing that several of the staff are unsuited to the job, are dealing drugs or are too busy fraternizing with female customers to care about breaking up the brawls that occur. Near the end of the night, a violent brawl becomes widespread among the customers and bouncers. Several pieces of furniture are destroyed, one of the bouncers, Steve, has a nasty shiner on his face. Morgan has beaten up several patrons, seemingly enjoying it. Dalton also catches up with the band's leader, the blind guitarist Cody, who plays behind a chicken-wire cage to avoid being hit by bottles thrown by customers. Dalton and Cody's band are plainly old acquaintances.Dalton goes to a used-car lot and buys another old clunker, a 1965 Buick Riviera. He also stops at a junkyard and buys several mounted tires, throwing them in the trunk. At a nearby farm, owned by an old man named Emmet, he rents a loft apartment. While he talks to Emmet about the rent, a helicopter flies across the small lake next to Emmet's property and swings low over his horse corral, startling the horses. Emmet grouses that the owner of the chopper, Brad Wesley, seems to fly low over his property just to agitate the horses and annoy him.Dalton and Tilghman hold an employee's meeting before the club opens that night. Tilghman announces that he's going to renovate the bar and that Dalton is now in charge of the management of the floor. Dalton immediately fires Morgan, telling him he doesn't have the right temperament for the job. Morgan threatens him and walks out furious. Dalton also fires the woman who was dealing drugs. He then lays out the rules; everyone will be on their guard at all times and not underestimate any customer's ability to cause trouble; they'll take any fights outside so that brawls don't further damage the place; and they'll ""be nice"" until Dalton determines they'll have to get more physical with any customers. He also tells them not to be angered by customers who insult them, saying ""it's just a job, nothing personal."" In the bar that night, a few brawls break out but Dalton and his guys are able to handle them as a team. Dalton catches Steven in a storeroom having sex with a female customer and fires him on the spot. He watches one of the bartenders, Pat, as he skims from the register and helps himself to free beers. Plainly reluctant at first, Tilghman fires Pat, which seems to carry more weight than simply getting rid of someone who was cheating him. Tilghman also remarks that it was a good night because nobody was seriously injured or killed.When Dalton leaves that night, he finds that the windshield of his Riviera has been smashed, all four tires have been flattened and the antenna has been broken. He scoffs as if he's seen it all before. While driving to town the next morning, he nearly collides with Brad Wesley, who is swerving dangerously along the road in his Mustang. At the local auto-parts store, Dalton befriends the owner, a man named Red. He sells Dalton a new antenna and says he'll order him a new windshield. Just then, Wesley walks in with a sinister-looking man named Jimmy, who glares at Dalton as he walks out. After Dalton walks out, Wesley seemingly greets Red with a friendly tone but Red knows the reason Wesley's there is to extort money from him.That night at the Double Deuce, Dalton is called up to Tilghman's office. The bartender that was fired, Pat, is there along with a man named O'Connor, who tells Dalton that Tilghman's had a ""change of heart"" about firing Pat. When Dalton asks for an explanation, O'Connor tells him that Tilghman buys his liquor and beer from Wesley and that Pat is Wesley's nephew. Pat pulls a large Bowie knife on Dalton, who easily dodges it and disarms him. One of Wesley's other thugs, a fat man named Tinker, slashes Dalton under his arm. Dalton easily beats all of them showing high skill in martial arts and crashes through the office window with O'Connor. He has his guys thrown them all out while he goes to the emergency room.At the ER, Dalton meets a beautiful young doctor, Elizabeth Clay, who staples up his wound, even after Dalton refuses to let her inject him with an anesthetic. He invites her to the Double Deuce.The next day, at Wesley's house, Tinker and O'Connor apologize to their boss. Wesley says he believes Tinker but makes O'Connor apologize repeatedly until Wesley beats him senseless.O'Connor and Tinker show up at Emmet's farm looking for Dalton. They tell him that Wesley wants to meet with him. They take him to Wesley's home where Wesley tells Dalton that he's been the driving force in bringing most of the big-name businesses to Jasper. He even offers Dalton a job at a new club he's planning to open. Dalton refuses and leaves. He later calls an old friend of his, Wade Garrett, another cooler, and asks if he knows anything about Wesley. Garrett doesn't and tells Dalton to watch out for himself.A few nights later, the bar has undergone the renovations Tilghman planned and the crowds have swelled. However, the place seems to be running out of alcohol rapidly. Tilghman says he's called every distributor he knows but none of them will do business with him. Dalton immediately realizes Wesley has interfered. Dalton places a call to a friend of his. One of the bouncers informs Dalton that a small group of Wesley's goons are at the door. When Dalton looks them over, he notices one has a small blade attached to the toe of his boot. Dalton refuses to allow them in and they quickly become violent but are easily taken down and thrown out. Doc Clay shows up and Dalton takes her out after his shift. She asks him if he enjoys his work and he reluctantly says he does, but it's just a job to him. She tells him with all the injuries he's suffered, he might not live to an old age and needs to slow down. He takes in her advice with mild interest.At the Deuce the next day, Dalton talks to Cody who tells him that Elizabeth Clay is Red's daughter and a one-time love interest of Wesley. When she left him, Wesley became intensely jealous. Cody warns his friend to tread carefully. Just then, a bouncer lets Dalton know a delivery has arrived. Out on the loading dock, Dalton supervises the inventory. Morgan, O'Connor, Tinker and another of Wesley's goons show up, ordering the delivery guy to take back his load. They begin smashing bottles and try to fight Dalton, who takes several of them down before he's hit over the head with a bottle. Wade Garrett arrives and goes out to the dock where he finds Dalton being held down while the goons take pot shots at him. Wade quickly joins the fight and they're both able to rout Wesley's men.Dalton takes Wesley to meet Elizabeth that night and she and Wade become instant friends. Wade suggests that Dalton may have found the woman that can change him. Dalton shrugs it off, thinking he leads too violent a life to settle down and that he hasn't had the best of luck with women. Wade tells him that the incident where he killed a man wasn't his fault since the woman Dalton was with didn't tell him she was married. Her husband pulled a gun and Dalton killed him, acting in self-defense.Garrett hangs out with Dalton at the bar the next night. Someone rushes in with the news that Red's store is on fire. Dalton runs out just in time to see the place explode, likely from a firebomb. Back at the bar, Wesley has sneaked in. He tells everyone that it's a shame that Red's place burned down. In an effort to antagonize Dalton and his crew, he orders his blonde bombshell girlfriend, Denise, to do a striptease. When she ignores the efforts of the bouncers to stop her, Dalton steps in and leads her back to Wesley. Wesley then sets up a fight between Jimmy and the bouncers. Jimmy beats them all down wielding a pool cue and making use of his own martial arts skill. He challenges Wade directly and the two fight furiously to a draw until Dalton steps in. He and Dalton briefly exchange blows until Wesley fires a shot from a pistol. He tells Dalton that things aren't working out and announces he'll leave.Some of the more prominent business owners, including Tilghman & Red, meet together to discuss how much more demanding, unstable and violent Wesley is becoming. Red is planning to leave town. After Wesley somehow gets word of the meeting, he has one of his men drive a monster truck through the car dealership of Stroudenmire, one of Jasper's businessmen. Wesley proclaims that Jasper is his town. When Elizabeth confronts him, Wesley reveals the real reason for his antagonism: Dalton. He says that Dalton either has to leave or he'll wind up dead.Elizabeth goes to Dalton's place that night and asks him to leave. Dalton refuses, saying he's dealt with men like Wesley before and that they won't stop until they're taken down. Elizabeth tries to tell him that the town is not his responsibility to save and that he might be too violent for it. Just then, Emmet's house erupts in flame. Dalton rushes in and carries Emmet out, who's uninjured. The house explodes again and Dalton hears Jimmy riding away on a motorcycle. He chases him and is able to knock Jimmy off. The two square off, trading martial arts blows. Dalton eventually wins the upper hand and Jimmy pulls a gun on him. Dalton knocks it from Jimmy's hand and sinks his fingers into Jimmy's throat, killing him. He takes Jimmy's body and sends it floating across the lake to Wesley's house.After he arrives at the Deuce the next day, Dalton gets a call from Wesley. Wesley tells him he's flipping a coin to see whether Wade or Elizabeth dies and doesn't tell Dalton the outcome. Soon after, Wade staggers into Deuce, having been beaten very badly. Dalton rushes over to the hospital to talk to Elizabeth, telling her she's leaving with him. She refuses, telling him to leave her alone. Back at the Deuce, Dalton sees Wade seemingly sleeping on the bar. When he turns him over, he sees that Wade's been stabbed with a combat knife. The devastated Dalton takes the knife and drives out to Wesley's place.Wesley's goons wait on his front lawn, armed with shotguns. They see Dalton's Mercedes speeding toward them and open fire. The car doesn't slow down and flips over the rock wall. As it does, one of the guys shoots the gas tank and the car catches fire, landing on its tires and rolling a few more yards. When they open the car, one of them finds that the accelerator pedal has been fastened down with his combat knife. He takes it and orders everyone to find Dalton, who's likely in the house somewhere. As the guy with the knife rounds a corner, he finds Morgan lying dead.Inside the house, Dalton stalks Wesley's guys, killing them one at a time. He also pushes over a large stuffed polar bear on Tinker. When Wesley enters the room and sees his henchmen dead, he taunts Dalton, saying that Wade was a ""mercy killing"". Dalton fights with Wesley, who tries to kill him with hunting spears. Wesley eventually pulls out a pistol. Dalton disarms him and tenses himself to tear out Wesley's throat, but Elizabeth walks in and stops him. When Wesley grabs his pistol again, he's suddenly hit by several shotgun blasts. Red, Stroudenmire and Tilghman have shown up, wielding their own weapons. Tilghman coldly tells Wesley the town is theirs, and fires the last shot. By the time the police have shown up, Red has hidden everyone's shotguns and they all feign innocence.The story closes with Cody's band playing at the successful Double Deuce and Dalton and Elizabeth enjoying a romantic swim together."

This film looks at life in the Bedford-Stuyvesant district of Brooklyn on a hot summer Sunday. As he does everyday, Sal Fragione opens the pizza parlor he's owned for 25 years. The neighborhood has changed considerably in the time he's been there and is now composed primarily of African-Americans and Hispanics. His son Pino hates it there and would like nothing better than to relocate the eatery to their own neighborhood. For Sal however, the restaurant represents something that is part of his life and sees it as a part of the community. What begins as a simple complaint by one of his customers, Buggin Out - who wonders why he has only pictures of famous Italian-Americans on the wall when most of his customers are black - eventually disintegrates into violence as frustration seemingly brings out the worst in everyone.—garykmcd Life over twenty-four hours during a heatwave along one small section of Stuyvesant Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn is presented. It is a historically black section, with the exception of Sal's Pizzeria, which has been located there for twenty-five years, Sal, who now operates it with his two young adult sons Pino and Vito, making the very conscious decision on location due to the overabundance of pizzerias in his own Italo-centric neighborhood, in the process doing good business. Sal's customer base has largely been the black residents of the neighborhood, he currently employing black Mookie as a delivery boy. However, the makeup of the neighborhood has slowly been changing with Latinos moving in - Mookie's girlfriend, Tina, also the mother to his son, being Latina - gentrification leading to well-off Caucasians buying properties, and a recent immigrant Korean family opening a general store across the street from the pizzeria. There has been an underlying tension between the races as each tries to stake out his or her place: competing boomboxes blaring Caribbean music from one and black music from another; Pino, in particular among those in Sal's family, not liking the business largely due to the clientele and neighborhood; and contempt by some for the seeming success of the general store operated by a visible racial exception in the neighborhood, despite that property having sat empty for years. But on this day, the seeming spark that may ignite that tension is black Buggin Out taking exception to Sal only posting the photos of ethnic Italian celebrities on the pizzeria's Wall of Fame, instead of including ""brothers and sisters"" to reflect the makeup of Sal's customer base.—Huggo It's the hottest day of the year in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, and tensions are growing there, with the only local businesses being a Korean grocery and Sal's Pizzeria. Mookie, Sal's delivery boy, manages to always be at the center of the action.—Jon Reeves <jreeves@imdb.com> Mookie (Spike Lee) is a young man living in a black and Puerto Rican neighborhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn with his sister, Jade (Joie Lee), and works as a pizza delivery man for a local pizzeria. Salvatore ""Sal"" Frangione (Danny Aiello), the pizzeria's Italian-American owner, has owned it for 25 years. His older son, Giuseppe, better known as Pino (John Turturro), is a racist and ""detests the place like a sickness"" and holds racial contempt for all the neighborhood blacks. Sal's younger son, Vito (Richard Edson), is friends with Mookie, who is black, which Pino feels undermines their fraternal bond. Mookie himself takes a very casual attitude toward his job: he often takes a long as he pleases to deliver food to the neighborhood residents, much to the consternation of both Sal and Pino. Mookie also has a young son with another neighborhood resident, Tina (Rosie Perez). Tina often criticizes Mookie for being unambitious and uninterested in planning a future for their son.The story takes place on one of the hottest days of the summer and the street corner is filled with distinct personalities, most of whom are just trying to find a way to deal with the intense heat and go about their regular day-to-day activities.An old drunk called Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) is constantly trying to win both the approval and affection of the neighborhood matron, Mother-Sister (Ruby Dee).A young man named Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) lives for nothing else but to blast Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" on his boombox wherever he goes. He wears a ""love"" and ""hate"" four-fingered ring on either hand which he explains in one scene to symbolize the struggle between the two forces.A mentally disabled man named Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith) constantly meanders about the neighborhood, holding up pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. that he hand-colors himself and occasionally sells.A fast-talking young black man, Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito), wanders around the neighborhood, talking to anyone who will listen about black civil rights.The local radio disc jockey, ""Mister Señor Love Daddy"" (Samuel L. Jackson) rounds out the neighborhood.Upon entering Sal's shop, Buggin' Out questions Sal about the ""Wall of Fame"" and demands he place some pictures of black celebrities (or as he puts it, ""brothers"") on the wall, since, he explains, Sal's pizzeria is situated in a black neighborhood and sells most of his product to black people. Sal replies that it is his store; he is proud of his Italian heritage and he doesn't have to feature anyone but Italians on his wall. Mookie tries to defuse the situation by taking Buggin' Out outside and telling him to wait a week before coming back. Buggin' Out attempts to start a boycott of Sal's over the ""Wall of Fame,"" but no one will support his protest: all the people of the neighborhood have been eating at Sal's all their lives. The only person who will join Buggin' is Radio Raheem, who earlier got into an argument with Sal about playing his boombox loudly in the store.That evening, as the shop is closing, Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out march into Sal's and loudly demand that Sal change the pictures on the wall. Radio Raheem's boombox is blaring at the highest volume causing Sal to yell and demand that they turn the radio down or leave the shop, but the two belligerent men refuse to do so. Finally, Sal snaps and destroys Radio Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat. Raheem is enraged and attacks Sal. A fight ensues that spills out into the street where it's witnessed by a crowd of spectators. The policemen arrive at the scene and try to apprehend Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out. Buggin' Out is arrested while Radio Raheem is placed in a chokehold by one officer, killing him.Afterwards, the large crowd of onlookers are enraged about Radio Raheem's death. A tense moment ensues when the crowd contemplates violence against Sal, Vito, and Pino. Suddenly, Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's restaurant, which turns the collective anger towards the property and away from the owners. The angry crowd becomes a riotous mob, rushes into the restaurant, and destroys everything within, while Smiley sets the restaurant on fire. From there, the mob begins to head for the Korean market. Sonny, the owner, tries to fight them off with a broom, yelling that he is one of them: ""I no white! I black! You, me, same! We same!"" causing the mob to spare his store. Firefighters arrive and begin spraying Sal's building as the crowd is held back by riot police. The firefighters, after several warnings to the crowd, turn their hoses on the mob, further enraging them. Meanwhile, Smiley wanders back into the smoldering restaurant and hangs a picture of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. on what's left of Sal's ""Wall of Fame"".The next day, Mookie returns to Sal whom is sitting in the remains of what was once his restaurant. Mookie demands his weekly pay he had earlier been demanding to receive early. Sal gives Mookie his money by throwing it at him and tells him that he is fired since he blames him for starting the riot the other night by throwing a trash can through his restaurant window. After a few minutes of arguing, where Mookie throws back any extra money that Sal tried to give him, the two cautiously reconcile. Mister Senor Love Daddy announces that the mayor of New York has founded a blue-ribbon committee to investigate the incident and dedicates the next song to Radio Raheem.The film ends with two quotations that demonstrate the dichotomy of the film's theme: The first, from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who argues that violence is never justified under any circumstances. The second, from Malcolm X, argues that violence is not violence, but ""intelligence"" when it is used in self-defense."

A going away party is then held for Charlie later that evening, with Charlie getting drunk, and Carface giving him a pocketwatch. Charlie is mentally unable to comprehend where he is, when Carface's goons blindfold him, and take him down to a dock, where a car is put in motion many yards away. Itchy has heard about the plan, but is too late to stop the car from killing Charlie.Charlie soon finds himself in Heaven, being explained things by a dog named Whippet.

However, as he rockets towards Earth, Whippet's voice is heard saying that he can never come back now.Charlie soon finds Itchy, who at first thinks Charlie is a ghost, but then grows even more concerned when Charlie wants to get back at Carface for attempting to kill him. Itchy is concerned because he has heard word that Carface has a monster that he has locked away.Charlie and Itchy break into Carface's place, only to find that the monster is actually a little girl named Ann-Marie, who can talk to animals. Carface has been using her to win (and fix) almost all the 'rat races' that the casino he runs has. Charlie soon convinces Ann-Marie that since she's an orphan, he can help her find a family that will adopt her, as well as intending to use the money that she helps win them to be given to the poor. While at the horse track, Charlie swipes the wallet of a young couple, and uses the money to help them win their first race.Charlie uses Ann-Marie's skills to make him enough money to start a new casino.

However, Charlie gives a long-pitched howl, which causes the alligator to spare Charlie's life due to his great singing voice. Unfortunately, Ann-Marie has caught a bad cold from being in the sewer, and Charlie is unsure what to do.When Itchy finds Charlie, he explains that Carface and his goons have torched their casino. Charlie contends that they'll rebuild, and use Ann-Marie to recoup their losses, with plans to give her to an orphanage afterwards. However, Ann-Marie hears Charlie's words and runs off. She is soon recovered shortly by Carface and taken to a derelict ship off the coast of New Orleans.Charlie goes after her, and ends up in a scuffle with Carface.

Glory,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097441/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Robert Gould Shawleads the U.S. Civil War's first all-black volunteer company, fighting prejudices from both his own Union Army, and the Confederates. Shaw was an officer in the Federal Army during the American Civil War who volunteered to lead the first company of black soldiers. Shaw was forced to deal with the prejudices of both the enemy (who had orders to kill commanding officers of blacks), and of his own fellow officers.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Following the Battle of Antietam, Col. Robert Gould Shaw is offered command of the United States' first all-African-American regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. With junior officer Cabot Forbes, Shaw puts together a strong and proud unit, including the escaped slave Trip and the wise gravedigger John Rawlins. At first limited to menial manual tasks, the regiment fights to be placed in the heat of battle.—Jwelch5742 The story of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, told mostly through the eyes of their commander, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick). Formed during the American Civil War, the 54th Massachusetts was the first African-American unit in the US Army. We see the formation of the regiment, its first volunteers, their training, disputes with administrators, their first operations in South Carolina and, finally, their moment of glory - the attack on Fort Wagner.—grantss During the American Civil War, the Massachusetts Infantry Regiment engages Confederate forces in the bloody Battle of Antietam. Captain Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) is injured in the battle and assumed lost, but is found alive by a gravedigger named John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and sent to a field hospital. While on medical leave in Boston, Shaw visits his family, and is introduced to former slave and abolitionist, Frederick Douglass (Raymond St. Jacques). Shaw is offered a promotion to the rank of Colonel, and command of the first all-black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, which will consist solely of black soldiers. He accepts the responsibility, and asks his childhood friend, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes) to serve as his second-in-command. Their first volunteer soldier is another one of Shaw's friends, a bookish freeman named Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher). Other recruits soon follow, including Rawlins, timid freeman Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), and Silas Trip (Denzel Washington), an escaped slave who is mistrustful of Shaw. Trip instantly clashes with Thomas, and Rawlins must keep the peace.When the Confederacy issues an order that all black soldiers found in Union uniform will be summarily executed as will their white officers, the opportunity is given to all men in the 54th to take a honorable discharge, but none do. The black soldiers undergo a Draconian training regimen under the harsh supervision of Sgt. Mulcahy (John Finn). Mulcahy comes down particularly hard on Thomas, who has had a relatively easier life than most of squad-mates and is consequently more out of shape. Shaw initially protests the treatment of his friend, but Mulcahy reminds him that this is the same training that all soldiers go through - and as a commander, Shaw has to treat all his men equally. Knowing how badly his men want to fight, Shaw concedes Mulcahy's point. But this causes some tension between him and Forbes, who is skeptical that the 54th will ever be given the opportunity to enter active combat.When Trip goes AWOL and is caught, Shaw orders him flogged in front of the troops. The scars of his previous beatings as a slave are exposed, presenting a real dilemma for the abolitionist Shaw. While talking to Rawlins, Shaw finds out that Trip had left merely to find suitable shoes to replace his own worn ones. Rawlins shows Shaw how many of the men have horribly infected feet because of their rotting footwear. Shaw realizes that supplies are being denied to his soldiers because of their race. He belligerently confronts the quartermaster, Kendric (Richard Riehle), whom Shaw outranks, and finds out that indeed shoes and socks were in stock but had not been given to the black soldiers. His advocacy on behalf of his soldiers continues through a pay dispute during which the Federal government decided to pay black soldiers less than white soldiers. Trip leads a large protest against the unequal pay and even Shaw himself joins in. The men also receive their Union army uniforms and a new sense of pride is instilled in the regiment.Once the 54th completes its training, they are transferred under the command of General Charles Garrison Harker (Bob Gunton). Harker pairs the 54th with the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment - comprised mostly of freed slaves - commanded by Colonel James Montgomery (Cliff De Young). During their voyage Rawlins is promoted to Sergeant Major. On the way to the main front in South Carolina, the 54th passes through the town of Darien, Georgia, where Montgomery allows his mostly undisciplined unit to loot and destroy the town. When one of Montgomery's men molests a slave servant, Montgomery coldly shoots his own man, blaming the slave's owner as a ""secessionist"". He then commands Shaw to order his men to burn the town. Shaw initially refuses, citing the order as illegal, but relents under the threat of having his command taken away and his men conscripted to Montgomery. Shaw continues to lobby his superiors to allow his men to join the fight. All their duties since being activated involved building and manual labor.Shaw confronts Harker and Montgomery and threatens to report the smuggling, looting he has discovered unless Harker orders the 54th into combat. In their first battle on James Island, South Carolina, early success is followed by a bloody confrontation with many casualties. However, due to the fierce fighting of the 54th, the Confederates are beaten and retreat. During the battle, Thomas is wounded but saves Trip, finally earning the respect of the former slave. Shaw extends Thomas an offer to return home for medical leave, but he refuses.Some time after, General George Strong (Jay O. Sanders) informs Shaw and his superiors of a major campaign to secure a foothold in Charleston Harbor. This will involve assaulting the nearby Morris Island and capturing its impenetrable fortress, Battery Wagner. The fort's only landward approach is via a small strip of beach with little cover, and the first regiment to charge is sure to suffer extremely heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers to have the 54th lead the charge. The night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service where individual soldiers offer their prayers amid singing hymns. Rawlins and Trip make emotional speeches to inspire the troops and to ask for God's help.The 54th leads the charge on the fort and heavy casualties ensue on the beach as artillery fire smashes through the ranks. As night falls the bombardment continues and no progress can be made. Shaw attempts to urge the men forward, but is shot several times and killed. Stunned, the soldiers stay where they are until Trip lifts up the flag and rallies the soldiers to continue on. He is shot several times while doing so, but holds up the flag to his last breath. Forbes takes charge of the regiment, and they are able to break through the fort's outer defenses, but find themselves greatly outnumbered once they are inside. Enemy cannons fire at the group of men killing them all (off-camera). The morning after the battle, we see the beach littered with bodies as the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. As the corpses are buried in a mass grave, Shaw and Trip's bodies fall next to each other.The closing narration reveals that Battery Wagner was never taken by Union forces. However, the sacrifice of the 54th, which lost nearly half its men in the battle, was not in vain, as their bravery inspired the Union to recruit thousands more black men for combat. Their participation would be credited by President Abraham Lincoln as an important factor that enabled the Union to achieve final victory over the Confederacy."
"Sex, Lies, and Videotape",1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098724/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A sexually repressed woman's husband is having an affair with her sister. The arrival of a visitor with a rather unusual fetish changes everything. John and Ann Mullany, a junior partner at a law firm and a housewife respectively, are a young, upwardly mobile couple, who most would deem to have a perfect life. Ann's outward perfection belies the fact that she is in therapy, dealing with the stress over worrying about global issues with which she has little to no control. She does not see certain things with which she does have control being problems in her life, namely her sexual repression or her disinterest in sex as an activity, that is until it manifested itself in this stress which in turn is having, what she believes, a negative impact on her marriage. What she is unaware of is that, long before her stress began, John embarked on an affair with her sister, bartender Cynthia Bishop, who she doesn't admire as being too ""loud"". John reconnects with a close friend from college named Graham Dalton, who, to John, appears to have lost his way in life in the years that they have not been in touch. Graham, via the method in which he deals with his emotional and sexual problems - which is also believes is being totally forthright to all concerned - has a profound effect on Cynthia, John and Ann, who in turn, especially Ann, have a profound effect on him.—Huggo The story of Graham (Spader), a long-lost college friend who drifts back into town, and a look into the lives of philanderer John (Gallagher), his wife Ann (MacDowell), and her sister Cynthia (San Giacomo). One by one, each is drawn into the very personal project Graham is working on, leaving the relationships between them forever transformed. Set in Baton Rouge.Ann Bishop Mullany (Andie MacDowell) is talking to her psychiatrist (Ron Vawter) about a dream in which she is taking out the garbage. Ann is frustrated and has reached the point where she no longer desires sex; although, she says that her husband, John (Peter Gallagher), had already stopped trying to touch her a long time earlier. Ann says that she also is irritated with John for having invited an old friend to stay with them at their house without Ann's consent; however, Ann tells the therapist that it is, after all, John's house, insofar as he is paying the mortgage. We learn that Ann has stopped working altogether, as John is quite successful, a self-made, aspiring big shot -- he plans to become a law office partner soon -- and the couple lives comfortably.Meanwhile, John has been having an affair with Ann's sister, cheeky Cynthia Patrice Bishop (Laura San Giacomo), who is sexually carnivorous and somewhat unrefined, in stark contrast to the more genteel Ann. The sisters enjoy something of a close relationship (talking and visiting often), although it has been clearly tainted by long-established friction. Ann, naturally, does not know of the affair, but has her suspicions.While Ann is in her therapy session, John and Cynthia are having sex. The lovers talk afterward and Cynthia tells John she harbours a ""perverted"" desire to make love to him in her sister's bed. Returning to his law office, John finds Ann had called while he was away to tell him that his old friend, drifter Graham Dalton (James Spader), has just arrived.The three of them, Ann, John and Graham, are having dinner together. John is critical of his old friend, whom he feels has changed considerably since their glory days (mainly, it seems, because Graham wears a black shirt, which John describes as undertaker's clothing). John mentions that Graham ran away from Elizabeth, his old beloved girlfriend. The tension between the two builds further when Graham remarks that liars are the second-worst people in the world, surpassed only by lawyers.The next day, Ann accompanies Graham in search of an apartment. One landlord (Earl T. Taylor) shows them a flat, and after haggling briefly over the rent, Graham takes it. Soon afterward, at a café, talk between Ann and Graham progresses on to the topic of sex. Ann says that women are not generally as interested in sex as men think. Graham admits to being impotent, that he can't have an erection while in the company of anybody else. (We later learn that he masturbates while watching women he has recorded on videotape talking about their sexual lives and fantasies.) Meanwhile, John calls Cynthia so that they can have sex together the way she wants. Cynthia calls him ""scum"", but, of course, seizes the opportunity to fulfill her fantasy and goes to the house where John waits, naked, on the bed he shares with Ann, covered only by a strategically-placed potted plant.On a later unannounced visit to Graham's apartment, Ann interrupts Graham while he is watching a videotape of one of his old girlfriends (Alexandra Root) detailing her sexual experiences. Through her inquiry, Ann learns of Graham's unusual fetish and asks him to watch a tape with him, but Graham refuses: He had promised all the subjects not to let anyone else see their tapes. Ann leaves, disturbed by the revelation (or, more likely, indignant over Graham's refusal) and advises her sister, during their next phone call, not to get in touch with Graham, as Cynthia, ever on the prowl, had promised to do. Cynthia, however, is only intrigued more so by this and visits him, anyway, even though, up to this point, they have never met. Graham soon invites Cynthia to make a videotape. During the recording, she then recalls her first sexual experiences aloud...Immediately afterward, Cynthia, worked up from the experience, calls John demanding he leave work immediately to have sex with her. In spite of the growing pressures of his job, he begrudgingly obliges, though he has to change important work commitments, which he does using ""a family crisis"" as an excuse.Later, Cynthia tells Ann that she has been videotaped by Graham, but refuses to be specific about what she may have told him. And while she assures Ann that nothing sexual occurred between them, she does reveal that she had chosen to masturbate for Graham, to which Ann expresses her extreme dismay.Ann visits Cynthia at the bar where she works to show her (and collect money for) the sundress she's bought as a joint-gift between the sisters for their mother's birthday. A tipsy regular (Steven Brill) who flirts constantly with Cynthia, tries to make a pass at Ann. They both ignore him. Ann leaves annoyed after Cynthia and the barfly remark that the dress looks more like a tablecloth.That night, Ann finally confronts John, asking why he was not in the office when she called, whether he's having an affair, and specifically if he has been having sex with Cynthia. John denies everything, playing both roles of offended husband and lawyer. It works and he convinces her.The following day, John gets angry with Cynthia upon hearing of her visit to Graham's and of her agreeing to make the videotape. After some heated talk, Cynthia tells John to leave, that she doesn't feel like going on with the affair any longer. Meanwhile, Ann is at home vacuum-cleaning the master bedroom when she discovers Cynthia's lost pearl earring stuck inside the machine. Slowly, Ann pieces together what has been going on, how foolish she has been, and reacts, first trying to smash the earring with the vacuum cleaner, then leaving the house after changing her clothes in a rage.Ann arrives at Graham's apartment. She quickly learns that Graham already knew (from Cynthia) that John was being unfaithful, but felt it wasn't his place to tell her. Ann now wants to make her own videotape. Although Graham is hesitant at first, she finally convinces him...Ann returns home very late, John already having started calling friends, frantically concerned that something may have happened to her. As soon as she sits down, Ann tells him she wants out of the marriage. John tries to play innocent once again, keeping calm, but upon hearing that Ann, too, has made a videotape, becomes irate and goes after Graham.John storms into Graham's apartment, punches Graham in the face, locks him outside, and watches Ann's tape. On screen, Ann reveals she's never had an orgasm, not even with her husband. Ann and Graham both admit to having had fantasies of each other. Ann wonders aloud whether Graham could give her an orgasm. Ann then begins turning the tables subtly on Graham, now asking him the questions. It emerges that Graham has spent the last nine years feeling sorry over his idealized ex-girlfriend, Elizabeth, with whom he somehow expected to reconnect, and that this was his reason for drifting back to Baton Rouge. Ann tells him that Elizabeth would never want him back after nine years and especially not with all his unresolved issues. Ann picks up the camera herself and now focuses it on Graham. He confesses that he used to lie compulsively, to everyone, and that the lying, as well as ""non-verbal"" acting-out of his feelings, was what destroyed his relationship with Elizabeth... After some quiet, affectionate moments together on the couch, Graham switches off the camera...As John leaves, having seen all of Ann's videotape, and perhaps truly knowing her for the first time, he spitefully reveals to Graham that he had once had an affair with Elizabeth while she and Graham were still together, even before the relationship started to go downhill. Once John is gone, Graham destroys his collection of videotapes.Some time passes. While John is in his office with a colleague (David Foil) prior to their golf game, John's most important client, the one he had run out on during the affair with Cynthia, calls to say he has found another firm to take his business. John's boss then insists upon seeing him immediately (suggesting that John is likely to be fired because of his irresponsibility).Ann surprises Cynthia with a visit during her shift at the bar to give her a small birthday present along with a new telephone number, the sisters making their first small step toward forgiveness and acceptance of each other. Ann then joins Graham where he waits outside his apartment. They take each other's hands as she walks up, then curl up together on the steps. It appears they are now a couple.It starts to rain."

Can the new batch survive the dream-within-a-dream and the blood-chilling advent of the infernal dream child?—Nick Riganas Taking place almost a year after The Dream Master, Alice and Dan have now started dating and there is no sign of Freddy Krueger. Alice begins to have dreams of a young nun, with a name tag for ""Amanda Krueger"", being locked away in an asylum full of maniacs. Upon graduating from high school, Alice and Dan plan their getaway to Europe. Alice has made some new friends: Greta, a supermodel in training; Yvonne, a future Olympic diver; and Mark, a comic geek.As Alice makes her way to work she finds herself back at the asylum. Alice is wheeled into an operating room on a stretcher, wearing Amanda's uniform, and screaming in pain. As Alice looks around she sees Amanda Krueger on the table, instead of herself, giving birth. As the baby is delivered, Amanda clamors to get to it. The baby breaks free from the doctors and escapes the room. Alice follows it into a church rectory, the same place that Alice defeated Freddy in the previous film. Before she can stop him, the baby finds Freddy's clothes and quickly grows into an adult. Amanda shows up to help Alice, but she's disrupted when Freddy slams the church doors closed on her. After these events, Alice finds herself at work, but four hours late.Alice immediately phones Dan who leaves their friends and rushes over to the diner. Before Dan can make it he falls asleep and Freddy forces him to drive into another vehicle. Alice, after watching Freddy take possession of Dan, faints in the middle of the street. At the hospital, she is informed that she is pregnant with Dan's child. While recouping, she meets a young boy, Jacob. Yvonne later informs Alice that there were no children on her floor, nor is there a children's ward at the hospital. Krueger begins to kill Alice's friends one by one as they fall asleep. First is Greta, by forcing her to eat herself to death. Krueger then goes after Mark, and only after Alice drawing herself into Mark's dream does Mark start to believe Alice. Alice requests an early ultrasound for her baby, and she soon realizes that Freddy is using her child to get into her friend's dreams. Alice also discovers that Jacob is really her unborn son. While Alice is looking for Amanda's body, Yvonne is attacked by Krueger. It's only when Yvonne barely escapes Krueger, thanks to a little help from Amanda's soul, that she accepts what Alice has been telling her. Shortly afterwards, Mark finds a comic depicting the entire events to that point and is drawn into his own nightmare. While there, Mark sees an image of Greta and finds his ""dream power"", the Night Prowler. He attacks Krueger, but is ultimately killed by Krueger and cut to pieces (literally, as he was turned into a paper character in his nightmare).Alice sends Yvonne to the now-abandoned asylum (former Westin Hills) to release Amanda's soul while she sets out to free Jacob. Krueger pulls her into a M. C. Escher-like labyrinth to try to slow her down. Freddy goes back into hiding inside Alice as she finally catches up to Jacob. Upon the revelation that Krueger has been hiding inside of her the whole time, Alice forces him out, but almost dies in the process. After being released by Yvonne, Amanda arrives and instructs Jacob on how to defeat Freddy. Jacob, releasing the power that Krueger has given him, forces himself and Freddy to revert back to an infant. Alice picks up Jacob and absorbs him while the now-infant Freddy tries to escape. Before he can escape, though, Amanda picks him up and absorbs him back inside. Freddy begins to fight from within and the church doors close. A couple of months go by; Alice gives birth to Jacob, and is finally at peace from the nightmares.In the film's last scene, the children who appear throughout the series and are used as omens of Freddy's presence are shown, humming the familiar song ""One, two, etc..,"" wearing church outfits.

He occasionally spends time outside prison in his garage fixing cars and looking at pictures of his childhood and high school football years and pictures of him with his father. He also spends time with his girlfriend Melissa (Darlanne Fluegel) and he goes to the park playing football with kids in the neighbourhood. Melissa drives him back dropping him off at prison and gives him a lucky charm necklace. One night while sleeping in his cell, guards arrive and forcibly take Leone to maximum security Gateway Prison run by Warden Drumgoole (Donald Sutherland). Drumgoole explains that Leone will serve hard timeLeone was the only person to escape from Treadmore and did so on Drumgoole's watch. Leone escaped because his mentor and friend was dying; Leone was refused even one hour to see him. Leone went to the press about the warden's treatment of his prisoners, resulting in Drumgoole's transfer to Gateway and Leone serving in minimum security before his transfer.Leone befriends fellow prisoners Dallas (Tom Sizemore), Eclipse (Frank McRae) and First-Base (Larry Romano). The foursome refurbish a Ford Mustang, which Eclipse nicknames ""Maybelline"". After Leone reluctantly allows First-Base to start the car he refuses to turn it off and drives the Mustang out of the garage. Drumgoole has them watch as inmates destroy the car and Leone is subsequently sent to solitary confinement for six weeks. The warden orders that the letters sent to him from his girlfriend Melissa be stashed away but as Leone is released Braden the good conscientious prison guard secretly delivers them to Leone.Upon release, the warden wants an excuse to slap Leone with more time, so he allows prisoner Chink Weber (Sonny Landham) and his bullying friends to kill First-Base in the gym. Leone fights and defeats Chink, but he spare's Chink's life because he knows that's precisely what Drumgoole wants. Since Leone didn't kill Chink one of Chink's friends stabs Leone from behind with a shank. Whilst Leone recovers in the prison infirmary, one night a stranger, an inmate who claims to be an old friend from Treadmore, says that Chink has paid him to rape and murder Melissa. Dallas offers to help Leone escape to warn Melissa but instead delivers Leone to the utility basement right into Drumgoole's hands where he finds out that Drumgoole wanted him to try to escape so he would receive a mandatory 10-year sentence for the second escape attempt and the inmate who was going to rape Melissa was just a corrupt prison guard called Mastrone who was part of the warden's scheme to set Leone up.Dallas agreed with the warden to lead Leone into a trap only if the warden would give Dallas an early release from prison. But the warden betrays Dallas telling him he doesn't make deals with escaped prisoners. He then tells Dallas he'll be sent back to the prison's general population, and since they now know he's a snitch the inmates will kill him. Dallas tries to attack the warden but the corrupt sadistic prison guards beat him up and push him into a pool of water. The warden then leaves the sadistic guards to physically abuse Leone by pushing his face into a cloud of hot steam from the pipes. Leone breaks free burning Wiley, one of the guards, in the steam and knocking out Mastrone he then fights the sadistic guard Manly and beats him up and pushes him into the same pool of water Dallas fell into. Dallas badly beat up apologizes to Leone and as Leone tries to help him Manly attacks Leone from the water and Dallas then rips an electric cable off the railing and electrocutes Manly in the water taking his own life as well. Leone who wasn't in the water survives.Enraged, Leone breaks into Drumgoole's office and takes him to the execution chamber and straps him to the electric chair. Leone activates the generator and secures his hand to the switch. The guards organize into a response team and secure heavy weaponry. The prison guards break into the execution chamber and point their Heckler & Koch HK33 and Winchester Model 70 rifles and Ithaca 37 shotguns at Leone, but if he is shot he will trip the switch and kill Drumgoole. The warden finally confesses to his plot to increase Leone's jail time. Leone pulls the switch but nothing happens; he then reveals he took one of the fuses out to trick the warden into confessing. Captain Meissner (John Amos) and his men cuff Frank whom the warden order's to be taken to the hole; however, Meissner and his men don't. They take Drumgoole into custody for the confession though the warden insists that he merely played along to save his life.A judicial inquiry is made into the matter about the warden's corrupt behavior and Leone serves only the jail time required of him in the first place. A few weeks later Frank leaves prison to the cheers of his fellow inmates. He meets up with Eclipse one last time, and receives a Cuban cigar which supposedly was given to Eclipse by Fidel Castro. He tells the captain who walks him to the exit that he'll miss his incredible smile and Captain Meissner shakes his hand and says his farewell. Frank then exits Gateway and embraces the waiting Melissa."

But more than that, they find they like each other. A lot.—Jeremy Perkins The Kozinskis - husband and wife Larry and Tish, and Larry's teenage son Mitch - lead a relatively carefree life. Larry chucked in his conventional job in securities to become a dance instructor, and in doing so in combination with similar acts, his paternal uncle Phil considers Larry unsuccessful in everything he does, except life. Larry recently married cosmetician Tish, a beautiful, sexually overt woman who is nonetheless insecure since she wants people to think she's smart.

Say Anything,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A noble underachiever and a beautiful valedictorian fall in love the summer before she goes off to college. High school senior Lloyd Dobler wants nothing more than to go out with beautiful and intelligent Diane Court. Lloyd attempts to win her heart over the objections of her over-protective father before Diane leaves for a scholarship in England.—Scott Renshaw <as.idc@forsythe.stanford.edu> Knowing precisely what he doesn't want to do, high school senior and aspiring professional kick-boxer Lloyd Dobler prepares for graduation. And determined to get beautiful Diane Court, the class valedictorian, into his life, Lloyd summons up the courage to call her, asking her out on a date. The problem is, Diane hardly knows her secret admirer exists. As if that weren't enough, Diane's doting but overprotective father thinks his sweet only daughter deserves better. Now, Lloyd stands in the way of Diane's promising future. With summer drawing to a close, will brilliant Diane devote more time to her father or trust Lloyd and fall in love for the first time?—Nick Riganas An improbable couple meets after high school graduation and must deal with their friends, family, and other pressures just to stay together. Lloyd Dobler is an average kickboxer with a good heart but limited ambition. Diane Court is an aloof genius who is very closely protected by her father. When Diane gets a scholarship to study in England, she has a weighty decision to make.—Jeremy Rasmussen <jr@intrepid.uunet.uu.net> It is graduation day, 1988, for a Seattle high school. Lloyd Dobler tells his girl friends Corey and DC that he is going to ask out class valedictorian Diane Court. They tell him he is crazy, because she is a ""brain"" and he is not.As Diane is getting driven to graduation by her father, she is practicing her speech. Her father, James, is extremely supportive, telling her that it is funny and everyone is bound to love it.At graduation, Diane's speech is a bit of a bomb. Nobody laughs and the only people in the audience who appear to be interested in it are Lloyd and Diane's father. In the speech, she talks about how she is fearful of the future. Lloyd keeps telling his friends about how much he loves Diane's eyes.After graduation, we see Diane receive a new car from her father as a graduation present. Meanwhile, Lloyd gets his friends to take a photograph of him as he walks behind Diane.Later that day, Lloyd gets the courage to call Diane. He invites her to a graduation party, and much to his surprise she agrees, even though it is unclear if she even remembers who he is. After the phone call, she is shown looking into her yearbook, and expressing surprise when she sees Lloyd's picture.Shortly afterwards, Diane's father gets a letter explaining that Diane has won a fellowship that will allow her to go to university in England. She will therefore be leaving in 16 weeks. Apparently this fellowship is only given to one student in America, so this is a huge honor.Lloyd picks her up for the party wearing a khaki trench coat. She is wearing a white skirt and matching blazer with a purple flower in her hair. Lloyd meets Diane's father and is very gentlemanly and polite.Upon arrival at the party, people are intrigued by the fact that Lloyd has shown up with Diane Court. It appears as if this is the first time that Diane has ever socialized with anyone, and they seem pleased that she showed up. It seems that while her classmates admired her, very few know her level at all. Lloyd is given the task of ""keymaster"", which means he has to spend the entire party holding a bag of car keys; he can only give them back to the drivers if they are sober.Diane and Lloyd do not spend the party next to each other, but at various points, Lloyd does check up on Diane, which she seems somewhat pleased by. When the party ends, there is one kid who is too drunk to drive. Diane and Lloyd drive him home, but it takes them three hours to find the guy's house. Lloyd doesn't end up delivering Diane home until dawn. The two do not kiss on this first ""date"", and her father is not upset by the late return, because she had called him while at the party to let him know where she was.It is clear by this point, that Diane likes Lloyd more than anyone might have expected. They arrange a second date: a dinner party with Diane's father and some of his colleagues from a senior citizen home, which he manages.Lloyd's friend Corey tells him to keep his mouth shut during dinner, which he mostly seems to do. At one point, Diane and her father tell a story about when Diane tried to board a plane once, but got so scared that her father had to tell the pilot to turn the plane around before it took off. Lloyd remarks that he is amazed by the closeness of Diane and her father: that he has nothing like that in his life. When asked what his dreams are for the future, however, he disappoints the adults by not having any ambitious dreams. He tells them that he just wants to spend as much time as possible with Diane and is interested in kickboxing.Midway through the dinner, two men come to the door to inform Mr. Court that he is under investigation from the IRS. He gets agitated and tells them to visit him at his office.The film progresses with scenes showing us that Lloyd and Diane are gradually getting more and more friendly with each other. At the same time, it is clear that there is a considerable stress surrounding the IRS investigation.Diane tells Lloyd that she is just too stressed out to get into anything deep with Lloyd. They agree to be ""friends with potential.""This status changes while Lloyd is teaching Diane how to drive stick shift. She is barely catching on, but enjoying the process. At one point, the two get quite close and Lloyd plants a kiss on her, which she accepts. They kiss a few more times and then decide to drive to somewhere more private.Eventually, we see Diane and Lloyd parked in Lloyd's car by the sea. The two appear to have had sex underneath some blankets in the back seat. Diane remarks how Lloyd is shaking. She thinks it is because he is cold, but he explains it is because he is so happy. On the radio is Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"". She tells him to listen to the song, because it is so nice.In the morning, Diane arrives home to a dad who is quite upset with her. Unlike the previous all-nighter, she failed to call him this time around. At this point she mentions how she feels free to ""say anything"" to her dad, and so tells her dad everything about her and Lloyd's relationship. She explains that she first wanted to avoid doing anything serious like sex with him, but in the end, she decided to go for it. While her father isn't upset at her, he clearly isn't thrilled to be hearing this from his daughter.This added strain between Diane and her father seems too much for her to handle. Her father suggests that she break up with Lloyd, to help make her life simpler. He suggests that she could give him something for him to remember her by, such as a pen, which he gives her.Next time we see Diane and Lloyd driving around, she breaks up with him. She is clearly upset about doing this, but goes through with it, and does give him the pen before exiting his car.Lloyd is quite upset. He leaves seven messages on her machine and in what is the iconic scene, stands outside her bedroom window playing Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" from a boom box which he holds above his head. Diane hears this, but only lies in her bed.Lloyd calls her one more time. We watch as Diane and her father listen to Lloyd's message. From Diane's reaction, it is clear that she is still very much attracted to Lloyd. Her father tells her to just pick up the phone, but she replies that if she did, she would just get back together with Lloyd. Eventually, she can't resist and picks up the phone, but just as Lloyd hangs up.By now the IRS investigation is heating up. Diane goes to the investigator's offices and demands that someone tell her what is going on. The man tells her that they believe that Mr. Court has been stealing money from the residents at the senior home when they die. He then hides the money in the form of cash and collectibles in the house. Diane is shocked and does not believe it.She goes home and starts searching the house for the supposed cash. Meanwhile, we the audience are able to see that the house is filled with the kinds of collectibles that the investigator tells her about. Prominently displayed is a Wurlitzer jukebox, which we previously learned cost Mr. Court $9,000. There is a Persian rug, and Diane stops to notice the fancy ring that her dad gave her as a graduation present. Eventually she opens up an antique box that her dad kept in his office, and discovers a stash of thousands of dollars.She confronts her dad, who tries to deny it. She is angry that, while she always told her father ""anything"" he is unwilling to come clean. He breaks down and admits that he was taking their money. He tries to justify it by saying that it was all done for the sake of Diane.While Lloyd is engaged in a kickboxing training match at the gym, Diane comes by to ask for forgiveness. She tells him that she loves him.Meanwhile, we see two lawyers negotiate a deal. Mr. Court will be fined and serve a year of prison time, starting immediately.We next see Lloyd meeting Mr. Court in prison. Diane is in the car, while Lloyd hands over a letter. It appears as if Diane is about to go to England. Surprisingly, we also learn that Lloyd is going to go to England with her.Eventually, Diane comes out of the car and does finally hug her father goodbye. Before leaving, she tells him to write her, and leaves the pen she had previously given Lloyd in her father's hands.The film ends with Diane and Lloyd on a plane together. A previous scene in the film indicated that Diane has never flown, and is very fearful of the experience. Lloyd tries to calm her down by telling her that most accidents happen in the first minutes of a flight. As soon as the ""fasten seatbelt"" sign goes off and a ""ding"" sounds, though, he tells her that everything is OK. The two are shown holding hands anxiously awaiting the ding. At the point that we hear the ding, the screen goes black, and the credits roll."
An Innocent Man,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097579/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man is framed by two corrupt cops for drugs. After he gets out of prison, he comes after them. Jimmie Rainwood was minding his own business when two corrupt police officers (getting an address wrong) burst into his house, expecting to find a major drug dealer. Rainwood is shot, and the officers frame him as a drug dealer. Rainwood is convicted of drug dealing, based on the perjured evidence of a police informant. Thrown into a seedy jail, fighting to prove his innocence is diffucult when he has to deal with the realities of prison life, where everyone claims they were framed.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Jimmie Rainwood is an ordinary man whose life is turned upside down when two (corrupt) cops, who took down the wrong address, bursts into his house, thinking that there would be drugs. To cover themselves up, they place a gun in Rainwood's hand and drugs all over his house. The fact that it's his word against two cops and that also the prosecution used some small indiscretions from his past to make him look bad, Rainwood is found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison. Rainwood tries to make the best of it, but when one of the cons sets his sights on Rainwood, Rainwood is told by one of con's rivals that he has to take out the con before he does anything serious to Rainwood. After being beaten up and witnessing just how sadistic the con is, Rainwood takes him out with help from Virgil, a con who's in prison because of the two cops who framed Rainwood. Rainwood's paroled after three years, and tries to get on with his life but the two cops who framed, are worried that Rainwood might come after them so they warn Rainwood not to do anything. And that inspires him to go after them with Virgil's help.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Jimmie Rainwood (Tom Selleck) is a respected maintenance chief with American Airlines in Los Angeles. He has a beautiful, successful wife (Laila Robins) and a nice home in the suburbs.Meanwhile, two rogue narcotics cops take down a cocaine smuggling operation aboard a fishing boat at the Long Beach waterfront. One armed suspect is wounded during the bust. The officers' behavior during the arrest unmasks their violent and unorthodox methods. One of the cops, Mike Parnell (David Rasche), carries the confiscated cocaine from the boat, stopping to put a couple of kilos in his car trunk before turning the rest over to a supervisor who arrives to take charge of the operation.The next day, Parnell and his equally crooked partner, Danny Scalise (Richard Young), stop at a phone booth to call an informant. As Parnell prepares to dial the call, he turns his back to Scalise and snorts coke from a vial he is carrying. The informant tips Parnell off to a suspected drug deal taking place that evening. Delighted, Parnell returns to the car and relays the address to his partner, but recklessly confuses ""Oak Lane"" for ""Oak Way.""Rainwood arrives at home that evening to find the empty house and cold salad he expected the night before. As Rainwood showers, Parnell and Scalise creep up to the house. After carefully peering inside, they break down the front and back doors and storm into the house while Rainwood uses a hair dryer. Rainwood hears the loud noise and steps out into the hallway, dryer in hand. Amped up by the tense situation and the cocaine, Parnell mistakes the hair dryer for a weapon and shoots Rainwood, seriously wounding him. Scalise enters from the back of the house and quickly realizes that the supposed weapon is a hair dryer. They search the premises and find no drugs. Realizing they are in the wrong house and knowing they have a solid file with internal affairs, they use a drop gun and planted drugs to frame Rainwood and cover their tracks. Kate arrives to find her husband seriously injured and falsely accused of selling narcotics and shooting at police officers.An Internal Affairs officer, John Fitzgerald (Badja Djola), is suspicious of the cops' story but has no proof with which he can challenge their version of events. The crooked narcotics officers coerce their seedy informant into falsely testifying that he had bought drugs from Rainwood on several occasions, and that Rainwater had used his airline maintenance job to smuggle the drugs into the country. Rainwood is confident that justice will prevail and therefore refuses a misdemeanor plea deal, since it would ruin his career. Shockingly, he is convicted of felony assault and drug distribution and sentenced to six years in prison.Rainwood is totally unprepared for the harsh realities of prison life. Soon after his arrival, his cellmate, Robby (Todd Graff), is shanked and burned alive in a prison yard vendetta. Rainwood decently but foolishly tries to rescue the dying man, but he is quickly tackled by lifer Virgil Cane (F. Murray Abraham) before the guards can shoot him. Rainwood tries to hang on to the morality of the outside world inside the prison walls, but he quickly realizes that won't be possible.Rainwood is quickly targeted for domination by a black prison gang and their brutal leader, Jingles (Bruce A. Young). Offered protection by an Aryan Nation gang in the prison, he declines, considering them an equally vile option. Not wanting to become a helpless pawn, ""Jimmie Rain"" is offered help by Virgil Cain, who was once set up by the same pair of dirty cops. Jimmie agrees to think about it, but refuses to consider solving his problem by killing anyone.Soon afterward, Rainwood is cornered by Jingles and two muscled-up members of his posse. When he refuses to give them his ""outside money,"" he is viciously beaten, ending up in the infirmary. He refuses to identify his attackers to the chief guard, Lt. Freebery (J. Kenneth Campbell), earning him 15 days in segregation. Back in the general population, he is once again confronted by Jingles, who taunts him about the beating. Virgil offers him advice once again, but Jimmie isn't ready yet. Then in the gym one day, Rainwood is seized by Jingles and his crew, hustled into the bathroom, and made to watch the brutal rape of an inmate who was ""sold"" to them. Jingles makes it clear that the same fate is in store for Jimmie, and soon.Rainwood goes to Virgil and says he is finally ready to deal with his problem. In the prison workshop, a thick piece of Plexiglass is fashioned into a shank. At Virgil's direction, some shaved soap is mixed into Jingles' eggs in the cafeteria serving line. During a subsequent basketball game, Jingles suffers severe intestinal cramps and heads for the bathroom. Rainwood follows him in, taking the shank from it's hiding spot. As Virgil covers the entrance, Jimmie silently approaches Jingles as he is getting up off the toilet. Jingles, seeing the shank, sneers at Rainwood and threatens to take it away and use it on him. Jingles feints at Jimmie but isn't quick enough. Rainwood buries the shank into Jingles' midsection and breaks it off, preventing Jingles from pulling the blade out. He drops the hilt into the floor drain and staggers out with the help of Virgil. The warden admits he can't prove anything but sends Jimmie into solitary confinement for 90 days.Back on the outside, the two rogue cops approach Kate in a parking lot and threaten her, advising her to keep her mouth shut and to quit agitating about her husband's case. She goes to Fitzgerald and pleads for his help. When he tells her once again that he can't do anything without proof, she lies and tells him that Parnell and Scalise used the n-word to describe him. He confronts the pair in an alley and warns them to leave her alone.Having served three years, Rainwood is paroled. Kate brings him home, and he tries to adjust to life on the outside. As he works on his classic Pontiac Firebird one day, Parnell and Scalise show up and tell him they need to have a talk. Inside the house, they threaten and intimidate him and Kate. They emphasize that as an ex-convict, they can continually harass him and his wife. In desperation, Jimmie and Kate turn to Virgil, who concocts a plan to set up the crooked cops. They also meet with officer Fitzgerald, promising him a chance to bust Parnell and Scalise in the act of buying illicit drugs for the purpose of re-selling them.Parnell and Scalise have been busy taking down drug dealers in the area, stealing the bulk of the drugs, and selling them to a mobster named Donatelli at a discount. Rainwood and an accomplice from prison feed a bad tip to Parnell and Scalise through the informant who originally set Rainwood up. Acting on the tip, the dirty cops stage a raid and seize 25 kilos of cocaine. What they don't realize is that the drug dealers work for Donatelli. Donatelli demands the cocaine back by the following day. Parnell briefly muses to his partner about fleeing with the stolen drugs. That night, Rainwood and his accomplice, wearing ski masks, jump the surprised cops and steal the drugs. Donatelli has made it clear to Parnell and Scalise that he will kill them and their families if they don't return the cocaine. They stall Donatelli, telling him things are too hot at the moment and they will have to bring the coke back the next day. The desperate pair soon gets a phone call from the ""frightened"" hijackers, offering to return the drugs in exchange for a meager $20,000 in traveling money. Parnell and Scalise can't believe their good fortune. They decide to keep the drugs after the buy-back meeting and flee to Florida, $750,000 richer. The meet will take place at a marina.At the pre-arranged meet, Internal Affairs detective John Fitzgerald waits in his car and listens over a wire attached to Rainwood's accomplice, Malcolm (MC Gainey). Malcolm approaches with part of the coke and explains that once he has the money, his partner will leave the rest of the drugs in a nearby trash barrel. But hot-headed Parnell grabs Malcolm and threatens to blow his brains out. He demands that the mystery bagman (Rainwood) step out of hiding with the remaining coke. When Rainwood reveals himself, Parnell sends Scalise to retrieve the drugs and then shoots Malcolm in the back. Detective Fitzgerald exits his car, identifies himself, and exchanges gunfire with Parnell. Scalise jumps in his car with the bag of drugs and tries to flee the scene, but Fitzgerald manages to kill him. Parnell hijacks another vehicle from a startled driver and speeds off, but Rainwood leaps into the back of the car and and grapples with him, causing a crash that throws Rainwood out, injured and stunned. Parnell continues his flight on foot. Just as he thinks he is home free, Rainwood comes out of nowhere and slams into him. A vicious and bloody hand-to-hand fight ensues, with Parnell finally pulling a knife and lunging at Rainwood. Rainwood disarms Parnell and is about to cut his throat, but he hears Kate (who has followed him) begging him to stop.In a final scene, Parnell enter the same prison that had held Rainwood. Parnell hears someone call out to him from the cells above, referring specifically to him as a cop, and looks up to see Virgil Cane grinning in derision. Jimmie Rainwood returns to his airline job."
The Fly II,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097368/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The almost-human son of ""Brundlefly"" searches for a cure to his mutated genes while being monitored by a nefarious corporation that wishes to continue his father's experiments. Seth Brundle was a renowned scientist whose warped experiments with teleportation transformed him into a man/fly hybrid called BrundleFly. A few months after the BrundleFly insect met its demise by his lover's, Veronica, shotgun, she dies while giving birth to their son, Martin. Seth's corrupt employer, Bartok, adopts Martin, only so Martin can solve the new problems that the still-functioning TelePods present and to use him as a science project because of the dormant insect genes. Martin is now fully grown, even though he is five, and the fly genes begin to awaken and make him just like dear, dead dad. With the help of his girlfriend, Beth, they go to wherever they can find a possible cure before Bartok finds them and brings them back, but not before Martin finishes his transformation into MartinFly, the deadliest of the BrundleFly species.—Will A few months after a hideously deformed Seth Brundle was mercifully killed by his lover Veronica, she dies giving birth to Seth's son Martin. Martin is raised by Seth's evil employer Anton Bartok, who requires Martin's help to solve the problems of the Telepods, believing the Telepods are the key for worldwide domination. Martin ages at an accelerated rate (being the equivalent of 20 human years old at the age of 5), and the fly genes he inherited from his father begin to transform him into Martinfly, who, unlike his sickly father, is a very deadly force to be reckoned with. Befriended by beautiful computer specialist Beth Logan, Martin sets out for a way to cure himself, discovering that the answer lies within the Telepods...—Daniel Williamson and Nathan Redmond Several months after the death of Seth Brundle, his lover Veronica is giving birth to their son at Bartok Industries, the company that funded Brundle's experiments. The labor is very painful, and her accomplice Stathis Borans is dragged away from the procedure after he objects to her treatment. She eventually gives birth to a larval sac, causing her to go into shock and die. The larval sac is opened by the surgeons to reveal a seemingly normal human baby inside.The baby is named ""Martin"" by the scientists. He begins to age much faster than a normal human; the company's CEO, Bartok, tells him that this is due to an extremely rare disease called ""Brundle's Accelerated Growth Syndrome"", caused by inherited mutant DNA from his father (hence the disease's name). Martin is just as much of a genius as his father, and Bartok wants him to finish the work Seth started. One day, Martin sneaks into a room where animals are held for testing, and befriends a Golden Retriever. He slips out of his room one day to bring the dog some of his dinner, but he finds that it has been transferred to another section. Martin goes there to discover a new set of Telepods, like the ones his father invented; his dog is being prepared for teleportation. The scientists send the dog through, but it unfortunately emerges as a hideous mutant, biting off a scientist's fingers. A horrified Martin screams, as Bartok consoles him.Five years after Martin's birth, he is now physically 20 years old. He is taken to a new living space, which is much more luxurious and wide open. Bartok also tells Martin that he wants him to fix the Telepods; as Martin saw with the dog, they are unable to properly teleport anything, even inanimate objects like apples. Bartok assures Martin that the dog didn't suffer long, and apologizes for it. Martin is still skeptical about working on the Telepods, but Bartok gives him videotapes of his father being interviewed by Veronica to watch. On the tapes, Seth says that the teleportation somehow invigorated him and gave him more energy (though he was unaware of his eventual mutation at the time). Inspired by his father, Martin begins working on the Telepods.Martin eventually manages to send a telephone through the pods with no ill effects, but he quickly decides he needs organic matter to transmit. He befriends another Bartok employee, Beth, and tries to send a cactus she owns through the Telepods. It comes out heavily damaged. Beth then invites Martin to have dinner with her, and he agrees.One day, Beth takes Martin to a party in the Genetic Research area. He overhears someone talking about a hideous mutant the company has kept alive for two years. Martin slips away from the party and goes down to see it, discovering to his horror that the mutant in question is the Golden Retriever from his childhood. Outraged, Martin slips into the holding pen where the dog is to visit it. The dog is initially hostile, but it soon realizes who he is and relents. Martin sits and pets his dog for a while, before taking out some chloroform and putting it to sleep. The next day, Bartok asks Martin about a break-in at Genetic Research, which Martin denies knowledge of. Bartok realizes he is lying, and theorizes that Martin will eventually become just like him.Martin invites Beth to watch him teleport a kitten. While she initially reacts with horror, she is relieved when the kitten goes through unharmed. Later that night, Beth and Martin make love. The morning after, Beth notices what appears to be an open sore on Martin's arm. Theorizing that this is from the mutant DNA Bartok told him about, Martin asks the computer what can be done. It tells him that the mutant DNA can be replaced with healthy DNA from another donor, using a gene-swapping program built into the Telepod computer. Martin rejects this idea when he sees such a process would turn the donor into a horrific mutant.Martin notices the sore on his arm is secreting a sticky, web-like fluid. When Bartok finds out, he realizes that Martin will soon become a human/fly hybrid like his father. Beth then discovers she is denied access to Martin's work area, and is told that the company taped her and Martin in bed. She tells Martin, who angrily trashes his living area and eventually discovers the hidden camera inside. He destroys it and breaks into the surveillance area, discovering that every moment of his life has been secretly taped. He then runs into another tape of his father, this time in the initial stage of mutation, recounting how a fly had gotten into the telepod with him. Realizing what is happening to him, Martin escapes from Bartok's facility and goes to see Beth at her houseboat.Bartok's scientists attempt to activate the telepods, but they quickly discover that Martin has installed a password system (the computer asks for ""the magic word""). If the wrong password is entered, the computer will use a tapeworm virus to completely wipe its memory. Realizing that Martin must be brought back, Bartok's henchmen chase him and Beth, who go on the run. The two visit Stathis Borans, now a reclusive drunk, who theorizes that a cure for Martin's condition involves the Telepods. He gives them his car, and they check into a motel for the night. Martin's transformation quickly becomes too much for Beth to bear, and she surrenders the two of them to Bartok.A now-cocooned Martin is brought back to Bartok Industries, while Beth is interrogated about the ""magic word"". After some time, Martin's cocoon bursts open and reveals a human/fly hybrid-- ""Martinfly."" Unlike Martin's father, who was a sickly, deformed mutant, Martin's transformed form is extremely deadly, likely owing to Martin having been born with fly genes rather than being fused with them. It goes on a rampage throughout the facility, killing several security guards. However, a trace of Martin's humanity remains intact; the creature simply strokes a guard dog sent to locate it, and also refuses to harm Beth when it encounters her. Eventually, it breaks into the Telepod bay, grabs Bartok, and uses his hands to type in the his password -- ""Dad."" The gene-swapping program boots up, and the telepod door opens.Martinfly drags Bartok into the telepod with it, and uses Bartok's hands to gesture at Beth, telling her to activate the teleportation sequence. Over Bartok's objections, she activates it, and Martinfly and Bartok are teleported just as security breaks into the area. The two emerge from the pod fused into a large mass of slimy flesh. Martin breaks free, his human form restored. Bartok is now a hideous mutant. An exhausted Martin assures Beth that he is okay, and they embrace.Later, the Bartok mutant suffers an ironic fate; it is placed into the same area Martin's mutated dog was, doomed to messily eat gruel through its dying days. As the mutant crawls to the bowl of food, it notices a fly crawling on the rim of the bowl. With this shot, the film ends."

Zach Hutton is a womanizing, drunken writer whose life seems to be falling apart at the seams. He's still in love with his ex-wife (whose family can't stand him), writer's block is keeping him from completing his latest novel, and he repeatedly finds himself in trouble of one sort or another with the law, ex-girlfriends, and jealous boyfriends.—Humberto Amador Blake Edwards's return to the male-in-meltdown territory he explored in ""10"" and ""That's Life,"" stars John Ritter as unemployed writer named Zach, who is not only suffering from writer's block, but his drinking is out of control, as is his obsessive womanizing, and, not surprisingly, his wife wants to end their marriage. To add to his problems, his house has just burned down, and his agent is knocking at death's door. But since this is a Blake Edwards comedy, Zach has enough charm and relative affluence to continue his pursuits, which the director regards with a bemused detachment. One of his girlfriends sets his piano on fire, and another gets him to wear a glow-in-the-dark condom, allowing him to engage in a condom duel with her jealous, similarly clad rock-star boyfriend. Eventually, Zach turns to fatherly bartender Barney, who should have long ago cut off his bar tab, and psychiatrist Dr. Westford, and both tell him to stop destroying himself through drink.

Casualties of War,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097027/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the Vietnam War, a soldier finds himself the outsider of his own squad when they unnecessarily kidnap a female villager. During the Vietnam war, a girl is taken from her village by five American soldiers. Four of the soldiers rape her, but the fifth refuses. The young girl is killed. The fifth soldier is determined that justice will be done. The film is more about the realities of war, rather than this single event.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> The story is presented as a flashback from the point of view of Max Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) as he sits on a subway train in 1974. A young Vietnamese woman gets on the train. Eriksson looks at her with a haunted expression as he remembers his experiences in the Vietnam War.In November 1966, a group of US soldiers are on patrol in the jungle when they are suddenly attacked by the Viet Cong. During the attack, the ground cracks open beneath Eriksson and he becomes trapped in the hole, part of a tunnel system below the jungle. Sergeant Tony Meserve (Sean Penn) saves his life by pulling him out and shooting a Viet Cong who is preparing to stab him.The next morning, Eriksson, Meserve and the rest of their squad, Corporal Thomas Clark (Don Harvey), Private Hatcher (John C. Reilly), PFC Brown (Erik King), are taking a break in a river village in the Central Highlands. Suddenly Brown is shot in the neck. The soldiers manage to fend off the attack, and Brown is taken to the hospital by helicopter.After the incident with Brown, Meserve's squad is granted a 48-hour leave and they prepare for a night out in the nearest ville. However, their leave is cut short and they have to report for patrol the next morning at 6 AM. Meserve plans to go to the ville to a brothel, but not before he tells the squad that Brown died of his injuries.The squad are refused entry into a brothel by an MP, their company command. Private Antonio Diaz (John Leguizamo) arrives as Brown's replacement. Meserve tells his men about their next assignment and says that he plans to kidnap a local girl for their own amusement -- Meserve attempts to legalize the kidnapping by saying they'll ""requisition"" her. Eriksson tells his friend Rowan (Jack Gwaltney), about his concerns but Rowan assures him that Meserve is obviously joking. The squad arrive at a village and kidnap Than Tai Oahn (Thuy Thu Lei) in front of her mother and sister. Meserve tells Eriksson that they are going to have some fun with the girl when they arrive at their outpost. Eriksson and Diaz are both opposed to the idea and Eriksson tells Meserve that there's no way he's going to participate in rape. Meserve tries his best to get Eriksson to take part, even making threats on his life but he stands his ground against his superior officers. Diaz refuses to go against his comrades, and takes part to avoid been an outcast in the group. Infuriated, Eriksson is ready to help Oahn when Clark puts a knife to his throat and tells him to go on security for the night. Hatcher keeps his gun pointed at him as he walks away to make sure he doesn't try anything. Eriksson sits on watch, helpless and horrified, as he witnesses his comrades take turns with Oahn in the hut.Later on the squad have to take position on a railroad bridge overlooking a Viet Cong river supply depot. Eriksson and Hatcher return to the outpost to collect some more ammunition. Clark wants in on the action and tells Eriksson to stay with the girl, while he goes off with Hatcher. Eriksson fully realizes how severe Oahn's abuse has been. She is weak, cut, bruised, dehydrated and sick. He gives her some food and water. Meserve is furious when Clark and Hatcher arrive without Eriksson. He tells him to get back to the outpost and collect him and the girl. Eriksson is just about to leave the outpost with Oahn, and get her to safety when he realizes that it will make him a deserter. Seeing how desperate the girl is for him to go with her, he decides to go, but just as they are about to escape, Clark arrives and stops them.On the railroad, the squad are watching and waiting to attack. Oahn is coughing and, realizing she could give them away, Meserve tells Eriksson to kill her. When Eriksson refuses, Meserve orders Hatcher to do it but he pleads that he doesn't want to. Clark sees some helicopters approaching, and Meserve desperately orders Diaz to kill her. With Meserve goading him on, Diaz prepares to stab her, when Eriksson fires in the air to get the attention of the Viet Cong, stopping the murder. As the shootout takes place, Clark stabs her a few times but Eriksson is so occupied taking enemies out with his rifle that he doesn't notice. The situation becomes desperate when the Viet Cong move mortars up the river and begin lobbing shells onto the bridge. Meserve manages to take them out with a machine gun. Oahn, bleeding profusely from the stab wounds, slowly gets up and tries to make her escape. Meserve orders the squad to shoot her. Eriksson tries to intervene, but Meserve knocks him down with his gun. The squad shoot Oahn dead and her body falls off the bridge. Meserve leads his men away from the scene. As Eriksson slowly falls unconscious from the head injury dealt by Meserve, helicopters approach and they fire missiles, hitting the riverboat the Vietcong were using. In the course of the explosion, a passing U.S Navy boat catches fire and the crewmen are killed.Eriksson is carried out by an helicopter and wakes up in hospital. He tells Rowan about the kidnapping, rape and murder of Oahn. Rowan tells him to go and talk to Lt. Reilly (Ving Rhames). Reilly gives him a long-winded reply about how the incident could affect the operational record of his unit and suggests it's best to just forget the incident. Desperate to see justice done, Eriksson jeopardizes his military career and goes over Reilly's head and informs Captain Hill (Dale Dye) about the matter. Hill deals with the situation harshly, berating Eriksson and warming him about pursuing the matter by telling him that the soldiers won't get much of a sentence if they are convicted and that they could make life very difficult for Eriksson and his family when they are released.Not realizing that Eriksson has already informed the superiors, Clark tries to kill him with a grenade. Eriksson suspects something when he sees Hatcher at the door of the latrine and he greets the unseen Clark and then runs away. Eriksson sees the grenade and jumps out of the latrine just before it explodes. Eriksson confronts Meserve and attacks Clark with a shovel to the head. He tells them that everyone already knows what they've done and that nobody in authority wanted to listen to him anyway. At the bar, Eriksson drowns his sorrows and pours his heart out to a chaplain. An investigation begins and Oahn's body is discovered, Captain Hill telling Eriksson that his actions will have consequences because he couldn't leave the situation alone. The soldiers are court-martialed. Meserve is sentenced to 10 years hard labor, Diaz is sentenced to 8 years hard labor, Hatcher is sentenced to 15 years hard labor and Clark is sentenced to hard labor for life. As they exit the court, Meserve leans over in Eriksson's ear and whispers something inaudible with a crazed look in his eyes.Eriksson wakes up from his flashback on the train, deeply haunted. The train reaches the next stop, and the Vietnamese woman, who reminds him of Oahn, gets off. Noticing the woman left her scarf behind, he grabs it and gets off the train to return it to her as she walks up to street level to Mission Dolores Park in San Francisco. The Vietnamese girl notes Eriksson's haunted expression and comfortingly tells him that his bad dream is over now. A slight smile crosses Eriksson's face."
Prancer,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098115/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A farm girl nurses a wounded reindeer she believes is one of Santa's, hoping to bring it back to health in time for Christmas. Her holiday spirit inspires those around her, something her disheartened father is having trouble understanding. Jessica, the daughter of an impoverished farmer, still believes in Santa Claus. So when she comes across a reindeer with an injured leg, it makes perfect sense to her to assume that it is Prancer, who had fallen from a Christmas display in town. She hides him in her barn and feeds him cookies, until she can return him to Santa. Her father finds him and decides to sell him to the butcher, not for venison chops, but as an advertising display.—<Vertigus@aol.com> 8-year-old Jessica Riggs is raised by her older brother, Steve, and widowed father, John. Their apple farm has fallen on hard times. John is temporarily being helped by his sister-in-law, Sarah.
While walking home after a school Christmas pageant, Jessica witnesses a plastic reindeer fall from a Christmas decoration being hung above the main street in town. She concludes that it was Prancer from the order given in the poem ""A Visit from St. Nicholas"" (a.k.a. ""The Night Before Christmas"").
Afraid he will be unable to provide for Jessica, John discusses a plan for Sarah to take her in to raise temporarily. She overhears this, but initially does not know the full details. She and her best friend, Carol, go sledding and knock down some flowers at a house owned by a reclusive widow, Mrs. McFarland. While walking home, Jessica encounters a live reindeer in the woods. It runs away, disappearing into the darkness. Later, while walking home from school, she finds reindeer tracks and follows them into the woods once more. She hears a gunshot, and continues to walk. John eventually finds her, but almost hits the reindeer who is now standing in the road. Noticing it is wounded, he grabs his rifle, intending to shoot it. As Jessica pleads for him not to do so, it disappears.
Later while dreaming of Prancer, Jessica is startled awake by the scene of the plastic reindeer falling from earlier. She hears a noise and sees the window to the barn outside is open. Investigating, she finds the reindeer is now inside among the other animals. Afraid John will find him, she moves him to a shed. Certain that he is the ""real"" Prancer, she takes it upon herself to nurse him back to health. She calls a veterinarian who initially refuses, but comes over to find him.
Jessica later tells a mall Santa that she has Prancer, and gives him a Polaroid picture along with a letter to give to the real Santa before Christmas Eve. He takes them to the editor of the local newspaper. Eventually, Jessica apologizes to Mrs. McFarland, and asks her if she can have a job to help pay for oats for the reindeer. Mrs. McFarland agrees to pay her if she cleans a room in the house, and they become friends. The newspaper editor, inspired by Jessica's faith, writes an article which is then read by the local pastor in the middle of his sermon, which makes Jessica find out that she has been outed to the entire town. She becomes mad at Carol, who she thinks squealed. She then terminates her friendship with Carol, and later finds the article in the paper.
John, meanwhile, is reading the paper. Before he finds the article, he discovers Prancer has let all the other animals out of the barn. While he tries to round them up, Prancer goes inside the house and wrecks it. Townspeople begin to converge on the farm, wanting to see him. John grabs his rifle, threatening to shoot him when a local butcher stops him, offering to buy Prancer. Jessica, afraid the butcher will kill him, runs away in the night determined to rescue him. The butcher keeps him as a sales tool for his Christmas tree lot. Steve runs after her, telling her that he loves her even though they fight. She attempts to open Prancer's cage but falls, injuring her head.
Jessica stays in her bedroom, becoming despondent. John goes to her and she asks him to read a passage from ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus"". He tells her that times may continue to be hard for a long time but while he could bear losing the farm, he will not lose her. He changes his mind about sending her away. He suggests they take Prancer to Antler Ridge, which would be the perfect place for Santa to pick him up. The townspeople gather outside her window and begin singing to cheer her up. Prancer is taken to Antler Ridge where he runs out of sight. Following his tracks, John and Jessica notice that they vanish at the edge of a cliff. The faint sound of sleigh bells can be heard, and a streak of light is seen rising to meet Santa's sleigh. Jessica bids Prancer farewell, and to always remember her. The sleigh flies across the full moon and over the town towards the Riggs farm-its very first stop."

The Fabulous Baker Boys,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097322/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The lives of two struggling musicians, who happen to be brothers, inevitably change when they team up with a beautiful, up-and-coming singer. The Fabulous Baker Boys, a Seattle-based duo piano lounge act performing cheesy jazz renditions of pop standards, is comprised of thirty-something brothers Frank and Jack Baker. Older Frank, married with two children, is the controlling business manager, front man and sole programmer of the playlist. Younger Jack is the carefree one without commitments to anything or anyone, including women, he who has had a long string of one night stands, most specifically with cocktail waitresses. Jack's strongest commitments are to his aging dog, Eddie, and to Nina, the lonely adolescent who lives in the apartment above his with her single, constantly dating mother. Jack's commitment to Nina is because of her unwavering commitment to him. The Baker Boys' act is becoming stale and outdated, and as such their ability to hold onto what gigs they are able to get is getting more difficult. So Frank comes up with the idea of hiring a singer to beef up the act. After thirty-seven failed auditions, they finally hire the last, the thirty-eighth auditioner, Susie Diamond, a woman one step above white trash. Despite Susie having no formal singing experience, she has just a strong enough vocal talent of the music they perform, and can sell a song largely on her stage presence and sex appeal. She is able to turn off her outward tough girl demeanor once she's on stage. Susie is initially an uneasy addition to the act, but becomes an integral part of it as the act begins getting more gigs, more lucrative ones at that. But Susie's presence not only threatens the new act, but threatens the interrelationships between all three. Frank believes the biggest threat is any sexual tension, perceived or real, between Jack and Susie. However, the biggest threat is how Susie is able to expose the fundamental rifts between the brothers, Frank whose primary goal is to put food on his family's table, while Jack's is his true musical dreams which are being stifled by the act.—Huggo Frank (Bridges) and Jack Baker (Bridges) are brothers who have performed together in a small but successful piano act for years. However, their lack of ambition hurts them - they begin losing gigs, and are soon relegated to run-down venues. Attempting to infuse new life into their act, the brothers hire singer Susie Diamond (Pfeiffer). The new line-up brings success, but tensions mount as romance blossoms and one brother is left in the cold. Frank and Jack Baker are professional musicians who play in small clubs. They perform cover tunes of music standards and have never needed a day job. Times are changing and dates are becoming more difficult to get so they interview female singers. They finally decide on Susie Diamond, a former 'escort' who needs some refinement, but the act begins to take off again. While the act is now successful, both Frank and Jack have problems with their life on the road. Susie becomes the agent that makes them re-evaluate where they are going, and how honest they have been with each other.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Brothers Jack and Frank Baker have been playing lounges as a piano duo for many years but decide they now need a female vocalist to keep the act going. They are lucky to come across Susie Diamond, who can really put a song over, and the act takes off. But when the relation between Susie and Jack - younger, less committed, but more talented than Frank - briefly becomes more than professional, tensions surface between all three.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The film opens with Jack Baker getting dressed while a brunette, who was a one night stand, lies in bed. He is dressing in a tuxedo. She asks, ""Will I see you again?"" When he answers ""No,"" she doesn't seem particularly moved one way or the other. As he leaves, she says, ""You got great hands."" Then, as Jack walks through the streets of Seattle, the opening credits scroll across the screen. He arrives at work with two minutes to spare. Frank, Jack's brother, is in a restroom where Jack sprays his hair with Crowning Glory's Miracle Hair to conceal his age. The brothers are a duo piano team who are currently performing at the Starfire Lounge. They have been professional performers for the past fifteen years. The first number they perform is ""People."" After their performance, Frank collects their pay from the hotel's young and very condescending, assistant manager, Lloyd. Jack doesn't trust Lloyd, so he tells Frank to count the money.
When Jack returns to his apartment, Nina, a young girl from upstairs whose mother is always out with some guy, is attempting to play ""Jingle Bells"" on his piano.
At the brothers' next engagement at the Capri Hotel Luau Lounge, wearing Hawaiian shirts, they play the bossa nova classic, ""The Girl from Ipanema."" After their performance, the club's manager, Charlie, suggests they break up. He can't use them again, he says, because they have class and most people don't want class. He needs something that will draw customers, something more up-to-date.
Those comments, or criticisms, cause the brothers to consider adding a female singer to their act. At auditions to find the right singer, Monica Moran sings ""Candy Man."" She is clearly not what they are looking for, nor are several other auditionees who sing excerpts of ""My Way,"" ""Up, Up and Away,"" ""Tiny Bubbles,"" ""I Go to Rio,"" and ""I'm So Excited."" After auditioning thirty-seven girls, they are packing up when Susie Diamond stumbles in an hour and a half late. At first Frank has no intention of auditioning her, but he finally gives her a chance. She sings a soulful performance of ""More Than You Know,"" which Jack accompanies with lush harmonies on the piano. Afterwards, she asks, ""So?"" (Neither Jack or Susie seem to recognize each other or remember they have slept together.) The brothers obviously were impressed because she is hired. The next scene shows Frank nervously pacing because Susie is late for their first performance together. When she arrives, Frank doesn't like the way she is dressed, so he and Jack quickly buy her a dress and shoes that they deem more appropriate. They rush back to the Hilton Hotel Ambassador Lounge, where Susie, after some microphone problems and the brothers getting her started by singing the verse, sings ""Ten Cents a Dance,"" which is a very appropriate song for Susie considering some of her former jobs. Next a montage shows Susie and the boys performing ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" in one lounge after another. The crowds are more enthusiastic at each venue. By the end of the montage, we see a new cardboard stand-up with Susie's name and picture added to that of the brothers. When Jack goes to a club alone to get away from his brother, he hears a jazz trio play ""Lullaby Of Birdland.""
By Christmas, when Jack asks to walk Susie home, she tells him a relationship would not work with them having to work together every night.
The trio gets a booking at a swanky resort hotel. The first night, Frank is awakened at 2 a.m. by the blare of big band music coming from Susie's side of the suite (""Perdido"").
At their first performance at the hotel, Susie sings ""The Look of Love"" for dancing. Later that evening, the three performers celebrate their success on the terrace of their suite. Frank, who is getting drunk, hears a recording of ""Moonglow,"" which causes him to reminisce about Jack teaching him to dance. As a result of Jack's dance lessons, he got a wife and children. When Frank finally goes to bed, Jack and Susie dance to the song.
Soon friction arises. Frank complains about Jack's incessant smoking, but he is really upset because of his brother's growing relationship with Susie. Frank warns him to leave her alone. Later, they argue about what music to play.
Frank gets a call from his wife that Little Frank is ill and he is needed at home. Before he leaves, he gives explicit instructions about what Jack and Susie are to perform while he is away. Once he leaves, while Jack is on the balcony smoking, we hear a recording of the Duke Ellington Orchestra playing ""Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me."" During this time, Susie is seen smelling his aftershave lotion in his bathroom. Then a little later, she sees him checking out her perfume (there is also a bubble bath scene where Jack catches Susie when she slips on the sudsy floor, but that was omitted from the version viewed). Their next performance is New Year's Eve. Susie and Jack perform ""Makin' Whoopee"" (Eddie Cantor's original version was much more sarcastic than Miss Pfeiffer's). She sings the song, which warns about the dangers of married life, from on top of Jack's grand piano and sings part of the lyric directly to Jack. She ends the number by sitting on the piano bench beside him. After the countdown to midnight, she kisses him. Later that evening (or early morning), Susie and Jack are the only ones left in the room. As she talks about her former job as an escort, he begins to massage her shoulders, then, unzips her dress and rubs her back. After a passionate kiss, he lays her on a table (sexual activity is certainly implied, but not seen). Back home from their engagement at the resort, Frank, Jack and Susie meet at a diner to discuss future bookings. While Susie and Frank argue about potential places to play and song selections, Jack sits silently. When Susie walks out, Jack suggests that Frank loosen her leash.
Later, Susie finds Jack playing jazz in a dingy night club. He never notices her; he is lost in the music and is playing much more expressively. When he returns to his apartment, Susie is sitting on the steps waiting for him. Early the next morning, Susie is dressing to sneak out, but Nina comes through the window to take Jack's dog out for his morning walk. Susie finds an old photograph of Jack and Frank. The photo was taken when they were much younger and they are holding a bottle of liquor towards the camera. By this time Jack is awake and tells her the photo was taken at their first professional gig. She says she came by to tell him she has been thinking about leaving the act. Some guy wants her to sing commercial jingles. Showing no feelings at all, Jack encourages her to take the job. He says they can always find another girl.
At their next performance at the Hilton Old America Lounge, they perform ""Feelings."" Susie quits in the middle of the song; she says she just can't sing it anymore. Later, when she tells Jack she quit, just like before, he seems unfazed. She accuses him of being cold and uncaring about anything. She also tells him she saw him playing jazz at the dingy night club; ""dusting off his dreams,"" she called it. As she turns to walk away, she calls him a coward.
Frank booked the piano duo for a telethon because, he said, it would be good publicity. However, the telethon is on a small station and they are performing at 3 a.m. Just as they start to play, the telethon M.C. interrupts to announce an updated total. Jack explodes, charges the M.C. and walks out of the studio. Frank accuses him of being unprofessional and lauds himself as being the responsible one. They also argue about Susie, especially that Jack and she slept together (more explicit language was used). Their argument escalates into a fight where Jack almost breaks Frank's finger. Then before Frank can protest, Jack turns away and disappears into the night.
On the way back to his apartment, Jack stops in a diner. The waitress is Monica, who sings a bit of ""Candy Man"" to remind Jack of who she is. Jack almost propositions her, but a Susie thought makes him change his mind.
Once Jack gets home, he is in such a foul mood that he takes it out on Nina. She runs out of his apartment up to the roof, where Jack finds her. He apologizes and also offers to teach her something else to play besides ""Jingle Bells.""
After a few days, Jack goes to see Frank at his home to tell him he isn't coming back to the duo. He says he can't play the same songs the same way every night anymore. They open the bottle of booze they had received at the first professional engagement and drink. Then at the two pianos they started on many years before, for old times sake, they play and sing ""You're Sixteen.""
The film's final scene shows Jack waiting outside Susie's apartment. She's progressed from cat food jingles to vegetables. They both apologize for the way they acted when she left the act. She asks if they found a new girl singer. He says they didn't look for one. As she leaves to record a new jingle, he asks, ""Am I going to see you again?"" Not giving in easily, she asks, ""What do you think?"" He answers, ""Yeah, I think Im gonna see you again."" Then, after a pause, he says, ""Intuition."" As she walks away down the street ""My Funny Valentine"" is sung by Susie (or Michelle Pfeiffer) over the final credits."

The crew of the mining base must fight to survive against a genetic mutation that hunts them down one by one.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> In the Atlantic Ocean, 16,000 feet deep, the Tri Oceanic Mining Corporation keeps a eight-men crew with the mission of extracting silver and other precious metals. The geologist and leader Steven Beck works with Dr. Glen 'Doc' Thompson managing the miners astronaut wannabe Elizabeth 'Willie' Williams, the prankster Buzz 'Sixpack' Parrish, Justin Jones, Tony 'DeJesus' Rodero, Bridget Bowman and G. P. Cobb. He is also the liaison with the Tri Oceanic executive Ms. Martin. In their next to last day, Willie and Sixpack are assigned to work outside the base and Sixpack falls in a hole. Willie seeks him out and finds a Russian vessel named Leviathan. Sixpack finds a safe inside the vessel and brings it to their base. They find money, vodka, a videotape and documents and Beck keeps the content of the safe. However Sixpack steals a bottle of vodka and drinks with Bowman. Meanwhile Beck and Doc watch the videotape and the Russian Captain explains a problem that killed his crew. On the next morning, Sixpack does not feel well and stays in the sickbay.

But there is a hurricane on the surface and the rescuing mission is not possible.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the near-future, the intercontinental corporation, Tri-Oceanic Corp., has hired a crew of undersea miners to do a 90-day mining operation on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. The head of the corporation, Miss Martin (Meg Foster), hires Steven Beck (Peter Weller), a geologist, to assist in mining operations as well as command the undersea mining station. In addition to Beck, the eight-person crew consists of Dr. Glen 'Doc' Thompson (Richard Crenna) the research specialist and local physician; Elizabeth 'Willie' Williams (Amanda Pays), a female miner; Buzz 'Sixpack' Parrish (Daniel Stern) a brash miner; Justin Jones (Ernie Hudson) a good-natured miner; Tony 'DeJesus' Rodero (Michael Carmine) another miner and mechanic; Bridget Bowman (Lisa Eilbacher) a maintenance worker and computer expert; and G.P. Cobb (Hector Elizondo) an older miner and multi-task maintenance man.While outside their vessel in a pressure suit during a routine drilling, Sixpack trips, falls into a ravine and stumbles upon a wrecked cargo ship. Because he didn't respond to hails over his radio, Williams goes to look for him and finds him excited over ""treasure."" From Williams' video camera feeds, Dr. Thompson sees that it is a Russian ship called ""Leviathan"" according to it's markings. When checking on records of Leviathan, the crew discover that it is still marked as an active ship on duty in the Baltic Sea.After Williams and Sixpack return from the wreck, the rest of the crew open a safe from The Leviathan that Sixpack brought back and find several crew records relating to deceased crew members, as well as a video tape from the captain. Among the materials, Sixpack finds a flask of vodka. There being no alcohol permitted in their underwater base, he hides it. Bowman figures out Sixpack had hidden away the vodka and persuades him to share it.That night, Dr. Thompson and Beck review the videotape of the Russian captain of Leviathan and believe his medical log was cryptic over the crew's poor health condition. The Russian captain describes his infirmary filled with sick crew members which the ship doctors tell him that it may be a ""tropical infection"" or ""plague"" infecting the ship and that ""something's off"" before the tape suddenly ends. They also look through the video images from Williams' camera of the Leviathan and noticed a large hole in the hull which was possibly hit by a torpedo.The following morning, Sixpack awakes feeling sick, with lesions throughout his back. The Doc Thompson is unable to offer any explanation for why Sixpack ended up like this. He asks the computer for an opinion, and it responds with a ""guess"", suggesting ""genetic alteration."" Sixpack dies eight hours after first feeling sick, but the doctor and Beck hide news of his death to avoid a panic amongst the crew. Dr. Thompson carries out routine medical checks to make sure no one else is sick, but doesn't have the chance to examine Bowman.While Beck and Dr. Thompson have a video conference with Ms. Martin (on the surface), Bowman has already began to feel the effects just like Sixpack. She becomes emotionally distraught when she begins losing her hair. She accidentally stumbles upon Sixpack's corpse and witnesses it mutating right in front of her.Meanwhile, Beck and Dr. Thompson don't want to take risks and ask Martin to execute an emergency medical evacuation. Martin makes the excuse that the evacuation will happen, but there is a possible severe storm on the surface which will hamper efforts, and may delay things for another 12 hours.Dr. Thompson finds Bowman. Unable to cope with the idea of dying like Sixpack, she has committed suicide by slitting her wrists in the shower. Her body is taken to sickbay, where Beck and Thompson find Sixpack's body mutating. They decide to dump both bodies without the crew's knowledge. As they are about to ""flush"" the bodies, the crew try to open the bag as they see the mutating corpses writhing through the body bag, and believe someone was alive inside.The creature that is forming inside attacks and claws Cobb before they succeed in ejecting the body. As the airlock closes, Sixpack's mutated leg is severed and falls out of sight. The surviving crew are finally informed of what has happened and realize that the Leviathan (ship) was experimenting with mutagens to the unknown crew. Dr. Thompson speculates that Soviet Russian scientists tainted the crew's vodka with live mutagen cells which made the crew members sick and mutated them into clones of a genetic undersea creature. The ship was scuttled when the experiment(s) went out of hand.Sixpack's mutating leg continues to metamorphose into a lamprey/leech-like creature. It attacks Dejesus in the kitchen. Jones tried to get help, but the creature assimilates Dejesus and begins growing tentacles that randomly attack the crew. Cobb's injuries cause him to mutate as well and he infects Dr. Thompson.As his last act of free will, Thompson ejects the escape pods so that no one can escape whilst there is a potentially dangerous mutagen on board. Jones, Willie, and Beck are the only ones left and consult Martin for emergency evacuation. Martin assures them that they won't be left behind, but that she cannot carry out the rescue yet because of the poor weather on the surface.The crew, suspicious, try accessing weather information through the computer, but it is blocked. Williams is smart enough to not ask the computer for a weather report, but a financial one from the company itself. They discover that the Tri-Oceanic Corp has already declared them dead, labeling it an accident.

Unlike the fascinating heroines of her favourite love novels, instead, Ruth silently endures the pain of watching her spouse, Bob, indulging in a series of infidelities with the lustful and uber-rich romance novelist, Mary Fisher. Then, to make matters worse, Bob has the nerve to leave Ruth. Now, to get even, Ruth meticulously plans her revenge, bent on destroying the audacious lovers' pink dream. Do they stand a chance against a heartless she-devil?—Nick Riganas Ruth Patchett (Roseanne Barr) lives in the suburbs outside New York City with her husband Bob (Ed Begley, Jr.) and her children Nicolette and Andy (Elisabeth Peters and Bryan Larkin). She is a competent and loving homemaker but her skills are often pushed aside by the fact that she is extremely clumsy, unattractive, and overweight.Bob works as an accountant in New York City and takes Ruth to a party at the Guggenheim Museum, to ""network."" At the party Ruth spills her wine on romance novelist Mary Fisher (Meryl Streep), much to Bob's embarrassment. Before Ruth can return with Bob's stain-fighting prescription of salt and Perrier however, Bob has already offered to drive Mary home, and she lives more than two hours away from the Patchett's home. Bob drops Ruth off at the curb in front of the entrance to their street, leaving her to walk home.Upon arrival to Mary's ""palace on the sea,"" she invites Bob in. However, the butler Garcia (A Martinez) has been waiting up for Mary all night, and is clearly displeased when he is sent straight to bed by Mary. In her office, Bob and Mary's ""business meeting"" quickly turns intimate and Bob spends the night.Upon arrival home the next morning in the middle of breakfast, Bob announces that he has landed Mary Fisher's account. Ruth becomes suspicious that Bob is having an affair, and begins to try to please him by doing extra chores around the house, such as cutting the grass and fixing the sink, and trying to look more attractive, going so far as to shave her unsightly mustache.Bob's affair continues, and Mary becomes annoyed when she must share him with Ruth; and Ruth, now sure of the nature of Bob's late nights at the office, approaches him. Bob responds that Ruth is his best friend, that his business with Mary is purely business related, and that he wouldn't hurt her, but warns her not to ""start"" as his parents are coming over for dinner.The dinner does not go according to plan. Bob spends another long day at the ""office"" and can't help Ruth cook. As a result, food is already coming out charred to a crisp and the appetizer of clam puffs has to be changed to cheese and crackers, which are also nearly spilled onto the floor when Ruth trips. The mushroom soup, which she had made just for Bob, as it is one of his favorite dishes, is revealed to hold Andy's missing gerbil when the lid is removed from the dish.A firefight ensues. Bob calls Ruth an incompetent homemaker and a lousy cook, and reveals to the kids that he only married her because she was already pregnant. Ruth storms out, and tells him that if he wants dinner, he can have Mary Fisher cook it for him. Bob's parents have had enough, and storm out--of the house.Bob moves out later in the night permanently, insulting Ruth all the way out the door. He tells her that he has four assets he holds dear: His house, his family, his career, and his freedom to enjoy them. When it comes to liabilities, he exclaims he only has one: Ruth herself. He calls her a 'She-Devil' and leaves.Ruth is enraged. She writes down his assets and vows to check them off one by one. She starts with the house, destroying it by starting a fire. She throws a live hanging lighting fixture, a clothing iron, and all of her books by Mary Fisher, which she had once enjoyed to read, into the washing machine. She turns on Nicolette's hairdryer, places it on the bed and covers it in pillows, overloads a single electrical outlet with nearly ten appliances, jams a food blender with a knife, throws a lit cigarette into the wastebasket, blows out the pilot light to the stove--with the gas still running, and places several aerosol cans into the microwave. She takes a picture of her family, the list of Bob's assets, the dog, and her lipstick, and makes it out of the house just in time for it to erupt in flames. Already she has an asset to knock off the list.Having nowhere to live herself, she drops the kids off at Mary's place to stay with their father, conveniently just as Bob and Mary share an intimate moment in the swimming pool. Bob protests, but Ruth outruns him in a taxi.Ruth starts a new life under a new name, Vesta Rose, inspired by a woman selling roses on the street, and heads to where Mary's estranged mother Mrs. Fisher (Sylvia Miles) lives, the Golden Twilight Nursing Home. Under her new identity, she secures a job as an orderly under the home's owner Mrs. Trumper (Mary Louise Wilson), and Nurse Hooper (Linda Hunt), only to discover that the home's residents are drugged nearly to the point of coma. Ruth decides it's time to wake them up, and switches the home's sedatives with plain vitamins.After the change Ruth starts a soccer league, which the old residents play out on the lawn still dressed in their housecoats and slippers. Hooper is irate, but decides that she won't tell Trumper when Ruth appeals to her and tells her that all women like themselves should stick together. Now alert, Ruth gets to know Mrs. Fisher, who turns out to be a chirpy and wisecracking old woman who does not speak favorably about her daughter. She talks Mrs. Fisher into visiting Mary, and puts her on the train herself.Meanwhile at Mary's, it is revealed Mary is inept to handle any task related to motherhood, and this is compounded by the fact that the kids don't listen to anything she says anyways. Nicolette sits on the lawn blasting the radio and talking on the phone all day, while Andy watches TV in the living room while Bob is still seen flirting with still more women. Furthermore, Mary's beloved toy poodle is killed when Andy throws a stick off the back edge of her property and the dog follows it into the rocky sea below. Mary begins to reach her breaking point when she is forced to do the unthinkable--laundry. The maid Ute (Susan Willis) is busy cleaning after the ever growing mess and the butler refuses to do anything but lounge in the swimming pool in protest of not being Mary's front line man. Mary, having never used a washing machine before, ruins all of Nicolette and Andy's clothes, pouring an indiscriminate amount of bleach directly on the clothes before starting the washer.Dinner is now shown at Mary's house with her mother over. Mary's hatred toward her mother is clearly shown--she doesn't even invite her to dinner, Mrs. Fisher discovers it herself and directs herself to a seat. On top of this, Mrs. Fisher reveals that Mary is not age 34 as she had claimed, but actually 41.Ruth and Hooper are enjoying lunch when Ruth breaks out her specialty--rich cakes and desserts. Hooper can't help but taste more and more, never having had a sweet in years. She warms up to Ruth and tells her that she has over $55,000 in the bank, as she has next to no expenses and has been working the nursing home for decades. Ruth exclaims that money has no value if it's not put to use, but leaves when Hooper reluctantly decides not to leave the home.Her mind is quickly changed however when Ruth is fired from her job. Incontinence is strictly forbidden at the Golden Twilight home, and Trumper discovers a big wet spot where Ruth had dumped Mrs. Fisher's bedpan into the bed and Ruth does not deny hiding the spot. Mrs. Fisher is not long welcome in the Golden Twilight home, securing her a permanent spot at Mary's crumbling palace by the sea (just as Ruth had planned). Ruth boards a bus toward New York City, and nearly leaves without Hooper who catches the bus at just the last second by chasing it nearly down the street.Meanwhile, Mary seems to be getting a burst in confidence when a journalist from People magazine comes to interview her. Mary is sidetracked from her new tea-time snack of Yoohoo and aerosol cheese by a phone call, and Mrs. Fisher quickly takes advantage of the situation to be interviewed and drops a bombshell--Mary was a ""teenage tramp"" who would do it ""anywhere, anytime, and with anyone"" and gave birth to a son that was fathered by a butcher when she was 16. The ""heir"" to the Fisher dynasty was adopted by another family, however. Ruth can cross of Bob's family from the list.Ruth and Hooper move to New York City where they move into a small apartment together as roommates, and using Hopper's money, they buy a run-down building in the World Trade Center district to open an employment agency for women like Ruth herself. Through much advertisement, the agency is packed on its very first day in business, despite the office still going through renovation. Ruth begins to form her own ""army"" of women, getting them jobs as data processors, bank tellers, and court reporters all over the city. One of her clients is the very young, and very attractive Olivia Honey (Maria Pitillo). Ruth, disguising her voice, and using a special ad just for Bob, gets Olivia a job at Bob's new office right in the World Trade Center. She becomes his next fling. But when ""Bobby"" won't get more serious with her, she asks Ruth for advice. She tells Ruth that his wife is a ""real nut"" who left him with the kids and that his current living arraignment is working out so great. Ruth tells Olivia she needs to speak her heart, that she loves Bob. Bob promptly fires Olivia, but not before she has gained unprecedented access to his financial information, and reveals to Ruth that he skims the interest off his clients accounts and wires it to a bank in Switzerland.Meanwhile, Mary publishes her next book, ""Love in the Rinse Cycle"", which promptly flops in sales and criticism. What's worse is that the new People article has been published, and it's a blistering tell-all. Mary begins to lose control, crying all day and taking copious amounts of anxiety medication to the point of collapsing spread out in bed.Ruth and Olivia plan a midnight Rendez-vous and sneak into Bob's office transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars into Bob's private overseas bank account in order to make more of the embezzlement charges they plan to file against him. With Olivia distracted, Ruth filters through Bob's files, and finds photocopies of Olivia's butt on the copy machine with Bob pinching them, while wearing the special ring Mary gave him engraved with his initials. The angered Ruth sends this letter to Mary under the disguise of a fan letter. This combined with the fact that the maid has quit makes Mary completely lose it, and when she finds Nicolette getting romantic with Garcia and Andy drinking with her mother, she puts her foot down, and declares herself boss, ""Starting now!""Ruth, now having sufficient evidence to accuse Bob of his fraud, she annymously calls the IRS and reports the crime.Still tense in the house, Mary throws a party to revitalize herself, but it comes to a grinding halt when detectives come to arrest Bob.After a meeting with an expensive attorney who revealed that not only will Bob's case be heard before a judge very lax toward white collar criminals, but that most of the stolen money came from Mary's account (which was the result of Ruth and Olivia's computer hacking). Mary wants Bob out, and fires him and tells him that their relationship is over... for good.Ruth contacts one of her many soldiers, a court clerk (Lori Tan Chinn), and asks if the judge can be changed to one more impartial. Grateful for Ruth's services, the now-clerk readily agrees and pulls strings to get ""Judge Brown"" to hear Bob's case now, instead of the lenient Judge Phillips.Bob's case is heard where the unbias, but unsymathetic Judge Brown, a female African-American judge, does not take any pity on him, nor buys his contraditing ""computer glitch"" defense to the embezzlement charges against him. Judge Brown finds him guilty of embezzling money, and sentenences him to pay a large fine and serve a minimum of 18 months in prison. Catching a glimpse of Ruth on his way out of the courtroom for the first time in months, Bob begs her to help him, but she has no sympathy. Ruth can now cross off ""career"" and ""freedom"" off her list, putting an end to her reign of terror. ""Poor Bob"", Ruth says in a voice-over. ""I almost felt sorry for him... almost.""The film then flashes forward to one year later. Ruth is visiting Bob in prison with the kids. She drops the kids off but before she can leave, Bob asks her if he can come over one night and cook her dinner when he gets out in another six or seven months. Ruth tells him that would be nice, and that she'll think about it. Bob asks Nichollete and Andy to taste some cookies he made in the prison kitchen and they burned, echoing Ruth's burned clam puffs.After the events with Bob, Mary sells her mansion. Her new book is called ""Trust and Betrayal: A Docu-novel of Love, Money and Skepticism,"" proves to be a critical and commercial success; Ruth appears at the book signing and asks the autograph to be made out to ""Ruth"", which causes Mary to give a momentary lapse of deja vu (considering that she never actually met Ruth face-to-face throughout the movie), but she shrugs it off. Next in line after Ruth is a handsome Frenchman whom Mary flirts with, showing that she is back to her old ways.In the closing shot, Ruth is shown walking down the street in the World Trade Center neighborhood, wearing current styles and her hair nicely done, surrounded by women wearing the Vesta Rose agency pin they received upon joining Ruth's ""army."" Breaking the fourth wall, Ruth looks at the camera and smiles... seemingly satisfied with the sweet revenge she devilishly duked out on Bob and Mary's faces."

His mother in particular did whatever she could to make sure Christy was loved and supported. Because of his inability to speak when he was a child, he was largely seen as mentally slow, he who surprised everyone by demonstrating his mental acuity in absorbing everything that was happening around him. Without the use of his hands, he used his left foot to express himself by painting, the paint brush grasped between his big and second toe. He began to be able to express himself more fully when he was taught to speak more clearly by therapist Dr. Eileen Cole.

The year is 1956, and he, as the front man, is trying to break into the business in a combo with among others his cousin,J.W. Brown, playing his rollicking version of the music he has always been interested in: what he heard emanating from the black honky-tonks of the south. Success and what goes along with it - fame and money - are arguably foremost on his mind. Against the many odds, he is able to gain that success, the odds including the Christian moral majority largely denouncing his type of music - hard driving rock 'n' roll - as that of the devil and thus anti-Christian, with one of his most vocal opponents with regard to his music being another cousin, sidewalk evangelistJimmy Swaggart.

Jamie, somehow psychologically connected with Michael, envisions this and grabs a chalkboard, writing out ""He's coming for me."" Michael then creeps up behind the hermit, and grabs him by the neck. The hermit yells in pain as Jamie screams once again. Michael throws the hermit into the air, sending him crashing onto the floor below. Withdrawing his knife, Michael raises it into the air and stabs the hermit. Nurse Patsey goes into Jamie's room once again, this time calling the doctors, who rush Jamie downstairs to an operating room. There, they find Dr. Loomis, who tells them not to do anything, that she will revive soon. The doctors become angry at him, thinking that he only wants her dead, but Jamie soon does as Dr. Loomis predicts.The next morning, Jamie is greeted by Rachel, a surprise visitor. Jamie, in her condition, cannot speak, and they are using signs to talk to each other. After a while, Rachel's friend, Tina, arrives at the window with Max, Jamie's dog. Jamie greets them and Tina reveals a costume that she bought for Jamie, a beautiful pink princess dress. Suddenly, at this moment, Dr. Loomis enters the room, asking what is going on. Tina, a bit frightened, then leaves with Max and Rachel says goodbye to Jamie, telling her that she will return in two days. Outside, Rachel speaks with Dr. Loomis about a note that was found reading: ""The evil child must die!"" Rachel asks why the people of the town can't understand that Jamie is just a child and is harmless. Dr. Loomis senses the fear in Rachel that this whole ordeal with Michael Myers will start over again, and Rachel leaves to go home with Tina and Max.Upon arriving at Rachel's house, Tina invites her to a teen party at the Tower Farm, but Rachel replies that her parents would kill her if she did something like that. Tina tells her to think about it and leaves. Rachel turns to go inside with Max, who pulls away, barking at something rustling in the trees near the house. Once they get inside, Rachel begins undressing to take a shower and goes to feed Max his dog food. As Rachel goes upstairs to the bathroom, someone stands outside, watching through the window.Meanwhile, at the clinic, the children are decorating a Halloween mural, when suddenly, Jamie senses danger for Rachel and Max. At the Carruthers house, Max stands barking at the back door while Rachel is showering upstairs. Dr. Loomis watches through the door at the clinic as Jamie begins wildly coloring blood-like red all over the mural. This attracts the attention of her friend, Billy Hill, another child at the clinic. He interprets what she is saying and turns to find someone, but Dr. Loomis is already there. While Rachel is in the shower, the phone rings, and, wrapping a towel around her shoulders, runs into the bedroom to answer it. It is Dr. Loomis calling for her to check on Max. Rachel obeys, going downstairs and finds Max gone, the back door open. Rachel then picks the phone back up, reporting that Max has disappeared and Dr. Loomis tells her to leave the house. Rachel, now frightened, hurries to the neighbor's house, finding him working in the garden.Later, after the police have inspected the Carruthers house, Rachel stands outside, nervously pacing back and forth. The police, Deputy Tom and Nick, return, having found nothing in the house. Rachel then inquires about Max, who then comes running down the street. Rachel, completely embarrassed, apologizes to the police. At the clinic, Jamie sits crying at the fact that she was wrong. Billy tries to comfort her, but she only pushes him away. Dr. Loomis begins begging her to tell him where Michael is, but she refuses to speak.Back at the Carruthers house, Rachel finds a cute sweater in her closet and puts it on, not noticing Michael's hand appearing behind the clothes rack. As Rachel looks at herself in the mirror, Michael walks behind her and out of the room. Rachel suddenly feels an evil presence and suspiciously walks down the hallway to Jamie's room. There, she finds Jamie's picture on the floor, the frame shattered. Instantly, Michael appears in the doorway and Rachel sees his reflection in the shattered glass. Spinning around, she screams and is too late as Michael raises a pair of scissors into the air and stabs her in the chest. Jamie, having seen this in a dream, awakes, shaking in her bed at the clinic. Nurse Patsey and the doctor try to calm her.Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis continues to warn Sheriff Meeker about Jamie's convulsions who dismisses it as a trivial matter . He reminds Meeker that his own daughter Kelly was killed by Michael along with many others just a year ago. He shows Meeker his burnt hand which was caused by the explosion at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital back in 1978. Loomis goes on to add that Michael isn't anything but pure evil to the point where even the entity of Hell wouldn't accept him. Officer Markland interrupts the conversation to notify Meeker that he is wanted at the cemetery. Tina arrives at the Carruther's home with groceries. She tries ringing the doorbell, but receives no response. Michael watches Tina inside the house.Tina runs around to the back where Max is chained up in the yard. She reaches for a spare key above the doorframe only to discover that the door was left open. She keeps calling for Rachael but recieves no answer as she enters the kitchen. Michael, watching her every move, stealthily walks from the living room to the hallway. Tina informs Rachael she got her a gift before removing the needle off of the record player. She runs upstairs, laughing, only to look inside of a room and find that Rachael isn't there. She says that she will miss her before she enters a bedroom and looks around. As she grabs a teddy bear off a shelf and lied down onto the bed she suddenly becomes startled by the doorbell. Tina looks out the window to find that it is her friend Sammy. She opens the door only to find that no one is there. Sammy suddenly sneaks up behind her and surprises her. The two embrace. Tina is excited that they have the entire house to themselves for the weekend after it is assumed that Rachael decided to leave the country with her parents. As they leave, Tina returns the spare key to the top of the doorframe. Michael has returned to the living room and watches the girls out the front window. Getting the feeling of being watched, Tina turns around only to find no one at the window.At the clinic, Jamie continues to suffer nightmares. Tina and Sammy arrive at the clinic after Tina expresses an interest in visiting Jamie. They are discussing their plans for the evening as Michael stalks them from a distance. Tina's boyfriend Michael speeds towards the girls in his convertible. Tina hops into the passenger seat when Sammy makes a point that Tina wanted to see Jamie. When Tina postpones, Michael only shakes his head as Sammy aquiesces and gets into the backseat. Jamie hears the revv of the enigne outside which wakes her up. She looks out the window to find Michael staring at her in the distance. She runs towards the front door when suddenly a shadow, presumably Michael's, looms up against the door. Jamie tries to open two other doors but they're locked. After failing to open several other doors, Jamie runs down two flights of stairs to the laundry room where she tears through sheets on clotheslines. She enters the adjoining boiler room where she attempts to climb and hide in a small niche in the wall. The figure following her was only the custodian who calms Jamie down and asks her why she is downstairs. Nurse Patsey enters and also calms Jamie asking if it was one of her dreams again. Jamie shakes her head. She is then returned to her room. Dr. Loomis closes the door. He pleads with Jamie to help him locate and stop Michael reminding her that he made her stab her stepmother. He warns Jamie that she can't hide from him because he will always get to her. Jamie only fears Dr. Loomis and does her best to ignore him. Loomis tells her of the coffin Michael dug up at the cemetery that belonged to an eleven year old girl. He asks Jamie what she thinks he will do with that. Nurse Patsey intervenes and tells Loomis to leave Jamie alone. Loomis continues to offer alliance with Jamie so they can team up and stop Michael together because there is a reason why he has this power over her.Meanwhile, a mysterious man in black clothing with silver-tipped boots exits a Lewis Bros. Stages Bus.Dr. Loomis arrives at the old Myers home armed with a gun. He climbs the front steps and enters through the front door. He looks around for Michael and even calls out is name but receives nothing. Eventually, Michael arrives and kills the cop by banging his head on the dashboard. When Michael gets inside the house, Loomis finds him and tries to reason with him. While attempting to take his knife away, Michael attacks him and goes upstairs. At this time, a police deputy is dangling a rope out of the window and begins to help Jamie climb out. But things do not go according to plan and Michael murders the deputy by hanging him out the window with the rope. However, Jamie manages to run past Michael.She hides in an old laundry chute and is forced to abandon safety after Michael finds her and repeatedly stabs the chute. Michael chases her upstairs. Jamie hides in the attic before spotting Rachel's dog Max hung from a noose, as well as the bodies of Mike and Rachel. Michael finds her, and Jamie tries appealing to her uncle's humanity but ultimately fails after touching Michael's face, sending him into a fit of rage. Loomis appears, using a tranquilizer gun to weaken him and then proceeds to violently beat him unconscious with a wooden plank until Loomis suffers a stroke.In the final scene, Michael is locked up in the sheriff's station, to eventually be escorted to a maximum-security prison. However, the stranger in black arrives and attacks the police station, shooting the officers with a sub-machine gun and causing an explosion. Jamie walks through the station finding the bodies of gunned officers, and goes over to Michael's holding cell to discover that it is empty. The movie ends with Jamie moaning in terror...."

Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098105/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Those bumbling cadets take to the streets when three inept goons successfully orchestrate a metropolitan crime wave. After the high-speed adventure inPolice Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach (1988), a spate of robberies in the stylish Wilson Heights district terrorises the city. Then, to make matters worse, when the trio of cat-burglars manages to pull off a daring heist right under the nose of Captain Harris, it is up to Commandant Lassard and a band of loyal graduates from the originalPolice Academy (1984)to stop the wave of thefts. Now, as a mole is leaking valuable information, only a well-organised undercover operation can expose the mysterious ""Mastermind"", the one behind the gang's crime spree. Can Lassard's finest crack the case of the Wilson Heights Gang?—Nick Riganas A gang is terrorizing citizens by robbing stores in the Wilson Heights district of town. Since a leak in the department is suspected, the Governor has chosen the officers from the police academy along with Captain Harris and Lt. Proctor to catch the criminals using old fashioned police work. When Commandant Lassard is indicted, the officers must bring the gang and Mr. Big to justice to clear him.—Mark J. Popp <poppmj@cadvision.com> The police must investigate a series of robberies along the old 51 bus route in the area of the city known as Wilson Heights. The mayor (Kenneth Mars) assigns Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) and Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) to the case. While on stakeout the Wilson-Heights gang, composed of Ace (Gerrit Graham), Flash (Brian Seeman), and Ox (Darwyn Swalve), manages to elude capture (Harris and Proctor were fighting amongst themselves while the robbery took place behind their back).
When the squad arrives and points out the fur store that was robbed, Proctor reveals he tried to tell Harris about it, but the latter would not listen. In his office, the mayor is furious with the latest crime spree and reprimands Harris for his precinct's slow response (and for the leak in Harris's office) and Commissioner Hurst (George R. Robertson) for not being strict with the former. Despite arguing their case, he points out that because of their slow response, everyone thinks he is incompetent to do his job and many merchants are leaving town. Under threat by the governor with revocation of his job, the mayor orders Harris, Hurst and Proctor to work with Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) to apprehend the gang. Lassard assembles a seven-man team consisting of Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) (who has his home protected by minefield), Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey) (Who is writing parking tickets), Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook) (who is driving men nuts in her gym outfit), Douglas Fackler (Bruce Mahler) (who sets the entire precinct office on fire within 5 mins of his arrival), and Lassard's nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy).Meanwhile the gang strikes a bank and gets away with $190k. But they leave behind all marked money.. Lassard's men interrogate the bank employees and get sketches of the perps and also figure that they are just hired help, acting for a mastermind.
After distributing fliers as to the information of the Wilson gang with little success, Nick stumbles upon a paper reporting an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait. However the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. Nick suspects that the leak is ""one of the task force""..
Nick then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession. Despite his fear of heights, Harris goes undercover as a window washer at a tall building and gets a confession of himself on tape after Proctor accidentally knocks him over the balcony.The robberies are committed by a group of three dimwitted criminals who do not seem to be able to do this on their own, and it is revealed they are being guided by a shadow figure known as the ""Mastermind,"" who speaks to the three behind a wall of glass and uses a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to get the police out of the way.
The gang hits a jewelry store, and Nick had the team staking out old bus route 51. They apprehend the robbers as they come out, but they manage to get away when Harris intervenes and starts squabbling with Nick for credit.
Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after jewelry from the gang's last robbery is found in Lassard's office, pending an investigation. The team decides to clear his name by nabbing the gang and the ringleader. Accessing data files from a computer, Nick deduces that the robberies are occurring along a bus route (where a new rail link is proposed to be built, which should increase the property prices tremendously), thus intentionally lowering property values in that part of the city. They also learn that someone must be leaking information to the criminals, which is why they are always one step ahead of the police.The mastermind instructs the trio to destroy power infrastructure in the city, causing a massive blackout. During street patrol, Nick finds the sewer entry point that the gang has been using.
The police academy force finds and does battle with the Wilson gang, taking down Ace, Flash, and Ox, while Nick chases the leader. A pursuit follows, which leads to Commissioner Hurst's (George Robertson) office. Though the others are fooled by the fact there are two versions of Commissioner Hurst, Nick is not fooled and is able to help them point out the real Hurst from the fake with a Pinocchio test (pulling on the suspects' noses, revealing the impostor by stretching their latex mask). With that, Hightower removes the mask and reveals the ""Mastermind"" as the mayor.Caught, the mayor admits that Captain Harris has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with him and how he could have made billions off the properties if it had not been for Lassard and his team. Hurst tells Hightower to take the mayor into custody with his gang. Hurst then apologizes to Lassard and reinstates him and his team, and a plaque is given to honor the officers' bravery the next day. As the movie closes, Harris is sitting in a chair when a string tying the balloon float is cut, lifting his chair and floating him up into the air as he shouts Proctor's name. As Harris floats away, it is revealed that it was Commander Lassard who actually cut the string as revenge for Harris' actions for getting him and his team off the case with his manipulation."

Scandalized, Emily hurries back to her own hotel room and puts on the dress that Claudia left for her to wear. In the lobby, she meets Claudia's date, James Wheeler (Mickey Rourke), an enigmatic American businessman accompanied by two bodyguards. They walk from the hotel to a nearby restaurant, and Wheeler lags behind so that he can watch Emily. At dinner, he asks Emily to guess the personal secrets of other diners. She describes an attractive married couple, stating that they met at a ski resort and honeymooned at a ""grand hotel"" that was surprisingly rundown. Wheeler presses for more information, but Emily does not want to go further. When he threatens to approach the couple, Emily stops him, continuing her story about the honeymoon. She describes the couple having sex in full view of a voyeur. Wheeler leads Emily to a patio, where they don masks and join a group of samba dancers. As she watches a couple doing a seductive dance, Emily is startled by a man in a wolf mask, who bites her neck.

Wheeler has invited Otto, a race car driver, to accompany him on a motorcycle ride. Emily joins Wheeler on his motorcycle, while Hanna rides alongside Otto's motorcycle in a limousine. Wheeler leads them to a Carnival celebration by the beach. There, Hanna is harassed on the dance floor, and Wheeler steps in to protect her. As Wheeler fights Hanna's harasser, another man tries to steal Hanna's necklace. Her dress is torn, exposing her breasts. Otto tries to cover Hanna up, but she yells at him to look at her. Wheeler ushers Otto, Hanna, and Emily back into the limousine. They ride in silence until Hanna starts to cover her breasts. Wheeler stops her, expressing his desire to look at Hanna's body. He compliments Hanna's breasts and torso, and suspects that Otto's anger toward her must stem from a past infidelity. Wheeler encourages Otto to admire Hanna, and places the man's hand on Hanna's thigh. He watches as they begin to make love. Emily becomes uncomfortable and asks Wheeler to stop them. Wheeler claims he cannot, and wonders if Emily has ever given in to primal urges.Wheeler takes Emily back to Elliot Costa's land and leads her inside the dilapidated hotel. Emily embraces him, but he evades her, claiming he is not good at being touched. That night, Emily waits for Wheeler at an outdoor bar. She is offended when an American named Jerome propositions her for sex. Wheeler arrives, and Emily explains the situation in tears. However, Wheeler encourages her to go back to Jerome's room. Emily tentatively collects the stack of money and room key Jerome left behind, and follows him to his room. She stands in the window so that Wheeler can see her as Jerome removes her dress. Changing her mind, she tries to get away, but Jerome wrestles her to the floor. She relents, and they have sex.The next day, Claudia and Elliot Costa return from Buenos Aires. At the airport, they sit down with Emily, and Elliot Costa's lawyers... one of whom is Jerome McFarland, to finalize the real estate deal.

When Elliot's lawyers attempt to demand more from the deal, Claudia asks Jerome about his wife, Cynthia, indirectly threatening to expose his infidelity. The deal is signed, and Claudia plans a celebration for that evening, when Mr. Chin, the Chinese investor whom she and Emily represent, arrives. Claudia asks Emily what she thinks about Wheeler, and Emily describes him as strange. Claudia admits she has been obsessed with him since they first met, and even hired a private detective to follow him. She uncovered that he grew up an orphan in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had a debilitating stutter as a child. Just before greeting Mr. Chin, Claudia and Emily learn that Wheeler thwarted their land deal by buying the deed to Elliot Costa's hotel. Claudia forbids Emily from disclosing the information to Chin, and their celebration goes on as planned.In the morning, Emily and Claudia spot an attractive Brazilian man (Jens Peter) on the beach, and Claudia gives him the key to her room. When he arrives, Claudia forces Emily to stay with them and translate their conversation since the man cannot speak any English.

He tells her she is ""like all the rest of them"" and storms out of the hotel.Later, Emily receives a package, containing the deed to the old hotel, which Wheeler has signed over to her. She informs Claudia that their deal is saved.Another day or two later, Wheeler shows up at Emily's hotel room and discusses his hardscrabble childhood. He began investing in real estate at 16-years old and found that women were attracted to his success, despite his stutter. The more remote he became, the more women pursued him. Therefore, he began ""playing games"" with romantic partners, and the games became a way of life. Emily begs him to touch her. At first, he refuses. However, he gives in, and they make love for the first time (in a very VERY erotic and climatic sex scene).Later over the closing credits, a happy and confident Emily is seen riding with James Wheeler on his motorcycle while Carnival rages on all around them."
Who's Harry Crumb?,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098645/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Harry Crumb is a bumbling and inept private investigator who is hired to solve the kidnapping of a young heiress which he's not expected to solve because his employer is the mastermind behind the kidnapping. Harry is the latest generation of the Crumbs, famous and extremely talented detectives. Unfortunately talent seems to have skipped a generation and Harry is reduced to ""gumshoe"" work at a remote branch of the Crumb detective agency. Back at headquarters, Crumb executive Elliot Draison hatches an evil plan which requires the inclusion of an incompetent detective. With Harry Crumb on the case Draison thinks everything will run fine for him. Despite his best efforts Crumb actually makes some headway in the case...—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Over the opening credits, a young woman named Jennifer Downing (Renee Coleman), is kidnapped by an unseen person while taking a mud bath at a spa.The next day at the Crumb and Crumb Investigations in downtown Los Angeles, Jennifer's father P.J. Downing (Barry Corbin), a wealthy shipping owner, and his trophy wife, Helen (Annie Potts), meet with Eliot Draisen (Jeffery Jones), the president the detective agency. P.J. wants to hire Eliot Draisen himself to investigate Jennifer's kidnapping, but Eliot claims he has no one available to take the Downing case. Upon P.J.'s insistence, Eliot decides to assign Harry Crumb (John Candy), the grandson of the firm's two founders.That evening in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Harry, disguised as an elderly window washer (with black-face makeup, a fake bush mustache, fake eyebrows, and a gray 'fright wig' resembling the hairstyle of boxing promoter Don King), is ten stories up alongside a seedy high-rise hotel and photographing a couple having an affair. When the couple move into another room, Harry rocks the suspended platform like a pendulum. He falls off the platform, grabs a rope and swings through an apartment window, landing in an easy chair.The next morning, Harry shows the photographs to his wealthy client, Mrs. MacIntyre (Michelle Goodear), only to discover he followed her by mistake. He gets called to come to the head office and takes a bus to Los Angeles, California. Upon meeting Eliot Draisen, Harry recites the Jennifer Downing case from memory. When he asks why there was no reference to the stolen jewels, Eliot informs him it is a kidnapping case. Harry leaves and Eliot telephones Dwayne (Doug Steckler), the animal trainer who is keeping Jennifer Downing in a cage, to tell him Harry is a bigger idiot than he had hoped for.At the Downing mansion, Harry gets his crotch soaked while standing over a sprinkler before meeting Nikki Downing (Shawnee Smith), Jennifer's younger teenage sister and Helen Downing, Jennifer's stepmother. Harry then meets P.J. in his study, who is assembling fishing lures. Harry shows off more of his bad-luck clumsiness when he puts his hand in an aquarium and a dog fish latches on to it. As P.J. tells him Jennifer is his favorite daughter, Harry leans on the desk and impales his hands on several of P.J.'s fish hook lures. Harry looks out a window to see Helen flirting with her tennis coach, Vince Barnes (Tim Thomerson). As Harry throws darts at a nearby dartboard, he hits his final bull's eye dart a little too hard in which the dart board falls off the wall and crashes on top of one of P.J.'s mini ship models.Harry, disguised as De Roach, a bearded Hungarian hair stylist wearing blue leather with a shaved head, goes to the spa to interview the woman who gave Jennifer the mud bath that ended in her kidnapping. While re-enacting the crime, Harry leans over a mud encrusted woman and his fake chest hair falls into her crotch. Slamming his fake hair back on his face as a beard, Harry learns from the attendant that Helen insisted Jennifer take her spa appointment on the day she was kidnapped.That night, P.J. receives a ransom note requesting $10 million. As he and Harry confer, Detective Casey (Valri Bromfield), a hard-boiled LAPD female police detective, arrives to take control of the case, stating her belief that all private investigators are incompetent slime. Meanwhile, Eliot meets Helen in the horse stables to inform her of the ransom note before pouncing on her. She fights off his romantic advances, telling him he is not rich enough to sleep with her. After dinner, Harry befriends Nikki, who tells him Helen is a money-grubbing nymphomaniac. Harry voices his suspicions that Helen is the kidnapper and makes Nikki his assistant.The next day, Harry and Nikki use cardboard periscopes to spy on Helen and Vince Barnes as they soak in a hot tub at the marina. Harry is too far away to hear Helen complain that it took her two years for P.J. to put her in his will and now the kidnapper is going to get P.J.'s fortune. Vince suggests they kill P.J. before he pays the ransom. Harry slips off the roof that he and Nikki are on and lands atop a ceiling face overhead a local restaurant where a young boy pulls the lever and makes the fan go faster and faster.That night, Vince and Helen ""fix"" the brakes on P.J.'s car.The next day, Harry bursts into Eliot's office, declaring that Helen is the kidnapper and having an affair with Vince. Eliot is clearly distraught over the news, for he decides to continue to win over Helen's affections.Later, Vince and Helen leave the mansion after seeing P.J. getting his car. However, Harry and Nikki ask to borrow the car. As Harry tails Helen and Vince, he confides to Nikki that he feels that he is living in his father and grandfather's shadow and Nikki admits she feels jealous of her sister and always feels living in her shadow as well. Harry believes Jennifer should feel jealous of Nikki. As they go down a hill, the brakes give out. Harry steers between oncoming traffic until he hits Vince's car and locks fenders. Vince speeds up, dragging Harry with him until they hit a bump, sending Harry's car into a small orange tree.After P.J.'s mechanic confirms the brakes were tampered with, Harry rightfully assumes that Helen and Vince were responsible, but he continues to mistakenly think that he was the intended victim, not P.J. Afterwords, Nikki tells her father she is helping Harry with his case. P. J. instructs her not to bother the detective, but Harry insists Nikki has been a great help.Later, Harry disguises himself as an Indian air-conditioner repairman (complete with a turban and brown olive-colored face paint) and smuggles Nikki into Vince's apartment building in a large toolbox. Harry climbs up an air vent while Nikki directs him using a short-wave radio. He hears Vince and Helen talking but is unable to see them through the vent. Meanwhile, Eliot Draisen telephones from a booth outside the apartment building and tells Vince he is late for a tennis lesson at the country club. When Vince leaves, Eliot enters the apartment and blackmails Helen for sex. While Helen goes to the bathroom freshen up, Eliot turns on the TV set and watches an old film-neoir movie in which the two characters discuss killing the woman's husband and absconding to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Eliot voices his approval and decides to follow their example once he receives the ransom money. Harry, thinking it is Vince talking, works a camera through the vent to take photographs. During the lovemaking, Helen complains the room is too hot, so Eliot turns on the air conditioning causing Harry to be blown into the apartment manager's (Joe Flattery) office, knocking the manager unconscious.That night, Eliot delivers another ransom note to the Downing mansion, stating the money must be paid by Friday, but Helen gets it first and alters it to read payment is due Monday (to give her and Vince more time to kill P.J.). The next day, Harry gives Eliot the photographs, claiming they show Vince and Helen engaging in sex. Eliot looks at them and is stunned to see himself coupling with Helen, but is amused and relieved that Harry seems ignorant. Harry admits he did not take time to look at the photos, and brags that he has so unnerved the kidnappers they have changed their plans and shows Eliot the altered ransom note. Harry then causes another accident when he gets on a stoic exercise bicycle and inadvertently releases the brake which cases the bicycle to crash into Eliot's dinosaur egg trophy shelf.At the mansion, P.J. receives a phone call from Jennifer, while Harry, Eliot and Detective Casey listen in. Jennifer pleads that she will be killed if the drop is not made at noon today. Jennifer instructs that the ransom money be dropped off at a phone booth at the Hollywood Park horse racetrack. Casey suggests they bug the ransom money suitcase. Harry agrees to drop off the briefcase containing the ransom as long as police stay out of his way. As instructed, Harry goes to the racetrack disguised as a jockey (the world's fattest jockey!). Harry squeezes himself into a miniature telephone booth and receives a telephone call from Eliot to ""give the money to Eliot Draisen"". Eliot appears and takes the money, leaving Harry stuck in the booth. Nikki arrives and while struggling to get out of the phone booth, Harry tells her that he overheard the kidnappers' plans to fly to Buenos Aires. Making his getaway, Eliot tosses the ""bug"" out his car window to throw Detective Casey off his tail, then empties the suitcase of its cash and tosses it into a dumpster. Vince and Helen, who have been following Eliot, jump into the dumpster only to find the suitcase empty.Eliot drives to the airport and telephones Helen, asking her to run away to Buenos Aires with him and the ransom money. She ditches Vince and rushes to Eliot. Once there, Helen confesses she was going to kill P.J. for the money, but now Eliot is rich and she is his. Vince appears with a pistol and Helen changes sides again. Eliot goes berserk, but Vince hits him in the head with the gun, drags him into a maintenance closet and chains him to a chair.Harry and Nikki arrive at the airport but, forgetting he has a steel plate in his head, Harry is detained by security guards at the metal detector. As the plane taxis to the runway, Helen looks out to see Harry on a boarding stair truck driven by Nikki about to trash into the plane.

Nikki crashes into the plane, throwing Harry through the plane boarding door. Vince pulls his gun, but Harry, who claims to know aikido, accidentally kicks his shoes off and into Vince's face, knocking him unconscious.Later, as Detective Casey gives Harry a reluctant apology, they hear Eliot Draisen kicking the closet door. Harry then brags to Eliot about him not thinking that he would solve the case now that Jennifer is found. When Harry removes Eliot's gag, he angrily screams at Harry and inadvertently confesses to organizing the whole kidnapping and he cannot figure how a moron like Harry unearthed his kidnapping plan. A surprised Harry leaves the room and tells the nearby policemen to arrest and book Eliot.Days later, Harry is made president of the company. He says goodbye to Nikki and P.J. Downing for his safe return of Jennifer. Nikki asks Harry if they could keep in touch should another case comes up, and Harry tells Nikki that he will let her know. After Nikki and her father leave, Harry sits down at his new desk in Eliot's former office. No sooner than as he relaxes at his new position, Harry receives a telephone call from someone asking him to come to San Francisco to help solve a murder in a gay bar. Harry agrees to take the case.(Note: Harry Crumb's sexual orientation is never revealed or discussed in the movie, but there are hints throughout that Harry might be a closeted homosexual because of his tastes in various fashions, his curly red hair, his lack of interest in women, etc.)In the final scene, Harry, disguising himself as a drag queen (strongly resembling drag artist Divine), walks out of his office to head to San Francisco and stops to tell his secretary that this is going to be a rough case. As Harry leaves for San Francisco, the glass door of Crumb and Crumb Investigations shatters as a final gag as the end credits roll."

That leads him right into a lion's den of sadomasochistic torture and torment.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} ""First there was the collapse of civilization...anarchy, genocide, starvation...then we got the plague."" Cyborg is about the post-apocalyptic struggle for survival of an urban ninja named Gibson (Jean-Claude Van Damme). The movie opens with a man and woman in jumpsuits fleeing sociopathic pirates (they have a boat) led by Fender (Vincent Klyn), a buff-looking guy wearing chainmail and sunglasses. The jumpsuited-man tries to hold off the pirates while his counterpart escapes. He is quickly killed by the feral pirate horde. Apparently the jumpsuited woman, named Pearl (Dayle Haddon), is a CYBORG and has obtained the cure for the plague in New York and is storing it in her brain/hard drive. Fender wants the cure for himself, so he commands his crew to capture the CYBORG.Pearl gets trapped in an alley by a trio of pirates, but they are quickly dispatched by the agile Gibson who happens upon the scene. She tries to hire him to take her back to the last group of doctors in Atlanta, who originally tasked her with finding the cure. They are interrupted by a pirate sniping at them with a crude-looking gun and Gibson is forced to run into a wood structure, which collapses on him. Fender takes possession of Pearl and heads back to his ship, destined for Atlanta.Gibson punches his way out of the rubble and follows Fender to the harbor. He finds a burning village and Fender already gone. While staring at the fire he notices movement in the shadows and throws an unknown projectile, hitting someone. The person turns out to be a villager that survived Fender's attack, named Nady (Deborah Richter). While waiting for her to awaken, he has a flashback to a previous family that hired him to get them out of New York. It shows Gibson leading them to a house in the country and then violent images involving Fender. Gibson waits for Nady to wake up and then he leaves. She offers to help him rescue Pearl, but all he cares about is getting Fender. They set off on the road to Charleston.Gibson and Nady stop for information in a shantytown where he talks with his friend Maize (Jophery C. Brown), who tells him where he can catch Fender's boat. It is revealed that Gibson had settled down with the family he rescued and given up his previous life.After leaving the shantytown, Gibson and Nady are ambushed by highwaymen. Gibson disappears into the woods and Nady flees to a nearby decrepit building. Gibson kills two of the men while in the woods and runs to the building, where Nady is being held at knife-point. Gibson, using his gun and boot-shiv, takes out the rest of the highwaymen and rescues Nady.The heroes finally reach the ocean where Fender must land and continue inland to Atlanta. Nady takes the opportunity to bathe and Gibson follows suit. While warming up around the campfire, Nady offers herself to Gibson, who declines and seems distracted. He then flashes back to a love scene between Gibson and the oldest girl of the family he rescued. As they lay sleeping on a bed, Fender and his pirates are seen standing at the window.The next morning the heroes find Fender's boat and follow him to an abandoned industrial complex. An intense gun and knife battle takes place, resulting in the death of more pirates and Gibson getting wounded by Fender. Gibson must flee with Nady after Pearl refuses to be rescued, relying on the forces in Atlanta to destroy Fender. Gibson enters the sewer and is followed by the pirates. He stops to kill the biggest pirate (Ralf Moeller) and then exits the sewer onto a field, where he and Nady begin frantically running. The pirates catch up to them and Gibson kills a few before being overpowered. Nady takes out one pirate but is knocked out (again). Fender proceeds to beat Gibson to a bloody mess and then nails him to the mast of a beached boat, leaving him to die.While hanging from the mast, Gibson flashes back for the last time to his adopted family in the country. He and the oldest girl and her little brother are tied up with barbwire hanging over a well. Fender gives the barbwire to the younger sister Haley (Haley Peterson) and tells her if she can hold it, her family will live. The wire rips through her hands and the family falls into the well. Gibson manages to climb out of the well, but the girl and her brother have died. Hanging on the mast, Gibson recognizes Haley as being Fender's woman now. Summoning his rage, Gibson breaks the mast with his heel and falls to the ground, where he is cut free by Nady.Fender and Pearl enter Atlanta and reach the center of the city by nightfall. In the rain, Gibson and Nady prepare for their ambush. Gibson gives Nady a knife and she runs to hide. Gibson fires a single arrow at Fender as he approaches. The arrow lands at his feet and Fender orders the remnants of his pirates to attack. Gibson deals with them while Nady sneaks up and takes out the two pirates guarding Pearl. Nady fends off the last pirate as Gibson and Fender commence their final showdown. Halfway through the fight, Haley yells at Fender to stop and he goes after her instead. Nady prevents Fender from killing Haley, but is slashed by his knife in the process. Gibson recovers and stabs Fender, finally kicking him onto a large hook which kills him. Gibson, Haley, and Pearl then mourn Nady's death.The trio arrive at the Atlanta facility and Pearl asks Gibson and Haley to stay, but alas they belong on the streets where they can help others. They leave as Pearl enters the facility and the armored door closes behind her."
Henry V,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097499/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the midst of the Hundred Years War, the young King Henry V of England embarks on the conquest of France in 1415. King Henry V of England (Sir Kenneth Branagh) is insulted by King Charles VI of France (Paul Scofield). As a result, he leads his army into battle against France. Along the way, the young King must struggle with the sinking morale of his troops and his own inner doubts. The war culminates at the bloody Battle of Agincourt.—Liza Esser <essereli@student.msu.edu> The heroic and ruthless King Henry V of England (Sir Kenneth Branagh) determines to lay claim to the kingdom of France. Henry's self-doubt and the diminished morale of his army stand in the way of a victory that would unite the two countries and provide Henry with a Queen. However, his sheer determination and his impassioned speeches ready his men for the bloodiest of battles, Agincourt.—Jwelch5742 Young King Henry V of England (Sir Kenneth Branagh) invades France in order to claim his right to a kingdom and to the daughter, Princess Katherine de Valois (Dame Emma Thompson), of King Charles VI of France (Paul Scofield) in this second movie adaptation of the Shakespearean play. Henry's small but embattled army meet the French forces on the field of Agincourt.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> The still young King Henry V of England (Sir Kenneth Branagh), intending to tax the English church, is sent off to war by the Bishops to enforce the (doubtful) claim to France. The King, thus sure of devine blessing for his cause, wages war on the French all too proud in overpowing strength. After the Battle of Agincourt, King Charles VI of France (Paul Scofield) has to yield his daughter, Princess Katherine de Valois (Dame Emma Thompson) as a peace offering. In a bitter satire, this political marriage is then portrayed as the happy ending joining the two recent lovers.—Stephan Elser The film begins with Chorus, in this case a person in modern dress (Derek Jacobi), introducing the subject of the play. He is walking through an empty film studio and ends his monologue by opening the doors to begin the main action. Chorus reappears several times during the film, his speeches helping to explain and progress the action.Act 1Early 15th century in England, year 1422 A.D.The Bishop of Ely (Alec McCowan) and the Archbishop of Canterbury (Charles Kay) collude to distract young King Henry V (Kenneth Branagh) from passing a decree that might confiscate property from the Catholic church. They agree to talk him into invading France. Canterbury appears in the throne room and explains to the King's advisers that Henry is rightful heir to the throne of France on the grounds that the Salic law in France unjustly bars his claim to the throne and should be disregarded. Supported by the noblemen The Duke of Exeter (Brian Blessed) and Westmoreland (Paul Gregory), the clergymen manage to persuade Henry to declare war on France if his claim on the French crown is denied.Henry calls in Mountjoy (Christopher Ravenscroft), a representative of the Dauphin. The Dauphin's condescending response takes the form of the delivery of a chest of tennis balls. Exeter, who opens the chest, is appalled, but Henry at first takes the insult calmly. He goes on to state his determination to attack France, dismisses the ambassador and starts to plan his campaign.Act 2Henry tricks three of his high-ranking officers -- Richard, Earl of Cambridge, Sir Thomas Grey and Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham -- who planned to betray the king to the French into pronouncing their own sentence by asking advice on the case of a man who drunkenly shouted insults at him in the street. When they recommend that he show no mercy to this minor offender, the King reveals his knowledge of their own sedition. They draw their daggers, but are quickly subdued by Henry's loyal nobles. Exeter arrests them for high treason, viciously slapping Scroop, the king's longtime friend and most trust advisor. Henry orders their execution before crossing the English Channel.Meanwhile, in France, Charles VI (Paul Schofield), the King of France and his noblemen discuss King Henry's threats. The Dauphin (portrayed as stubborn and cowardly) says he does not fear Henry, but Charles and the Constable of France are worried because of Henry's martial ancestors and the successful previous English invasions. Exeter arrives in full armor. He informs them that Henry demands the French crown and is prepared to take it by force if it is withheld, and delivers an insulting message to the Dauphin. King Charles tells Exeter he will give him a reply the following day.Act 3King Henry delivers a morale-boosting speech to his troops and attacks the walled French city of Harfleur. When the Dauphin fails to relieve the city in time, the governor surrenders in return for Henry's promise to do Harfleur's population no harm. Henry orders Exeter to repair its fortifications.Katherine (Emma Thompson), a French princess who had been engaged to marry King Henry in an arrangement made before the war, asks her lady-in-waiting Alice (Geraldine McEwan) to teach her some basics in English. Correct English pronunciation is very hard for her to learn but she is determined to accomplish it. In a silent moment, Katharine watches her father and his courtiers and notes how worried they appear. King Charles finally orders his nobles to engage Henry's troops, halt their advance, and bring Henry back a prisoner.Meanwhile, the English troops struggle toward Calais through foul weather and sickness in their ranks. Bardolph is hanged for looting a church, Henry declaring that anyone who commits such an offense will be dealt with similarly. The French herald Mountjoy arrives and demands Henry pay a ransom for his person or place himself and his entire army at risk. Henry refuses, replying that even his reduced and sickly army is sufficient to resist a French attack.Act 4In the boisterous French camp the night before the Battle of Agincourt (October 22, 1415), the French nobility wait impatiently for the morning, and it is clear that the Dauphin is not popular with the other nobles. In the more sober and silent English camp, following a brief meeting with his brothers, Gloucester and Bedford, together with Sir Thomas Erpingham, Henry decides to explore the state of his troops and wanders his camp in disguise. He meets Pistol, who fails to recognize him. Soon afterwards, he encounters a small group of soldiers, including Bates and Williams, with whom he debates his own culpability for any deaths to follow. He and Williams almost come to blows, and they agree to duel the day after, should they survive. When Williams and his friends leave the King alone, Henry breaks into a monologue about his burdens and prays to God for help.Next morning, the English Army is outnumbered five to one. Henry rallies his troops with his St. Crispin's Day Speech and responds angrily when Mountjoy renews the Dauphin's offer of ransom. The battle begins with the charge of the French cavalry, but the English archery and counter-charge cut down a large part of the advancing army before it even reaches their lines. When the Constable of France is killed, the dismayed French leaders realize the battle is lost and become desperate. Some of them steal behind enemy lines and, deprived of any hope to turn the battle, break the code of chivalry by murdering the young and defenseless English pages and setting fire to the English tents. Henry and his officer Fluellen come upon the carnage and are still appalled when Mountjoy delivers the French surrender.Henry returns Williams' glove, this time out of disguise, and William is shocked to learn that the man he was arguing with the night before was King Henry himself.The act ends with a four-minute long tracking shot, as Non no-bis is sung and the dead and wounded are carried off the field.Act 5Finally negotiations are made for Henry to be named king of both England and France. While the French and English royal delegations negotiate the Treaty of Troyes, the sides take a brief intermission in which Henry privately speaks with Katherine. He assures 'Kate' that by marrying a French princess he demonstrates his respect for the people of France, and professes his love for her. The delegation returns and Henry announces a hopeful era of long peace with the joining of the two kingdoms.The film ends with Chorus detailing the history after the events of the film, culminating in the loss of the French throne by Henry VI."

Warlock,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098622/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A warlock flees from the 17th to the 20th century, with a witch-hunter in hot pursuit. In Boston of 1691, a warlock is sentenced to death, but escapes magically into the future (our present), followed doggedly by the witch hunter. There he is searching for the three parts of the Devil's Bible, trailed by the witch hunter and the woman whose house he landed in. They must stop him, as the book contains the true name of God, which he can use to un-create the world.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> The scene opens in early colonial America, in Boston, Massachusetts in 1691. A combination gallows/pyre has been constructed for an execution by both hanging and burning, and a man is shown roughly loading feral cats into a wicker basket. Village elders are entering a small tower being used as a prison; its door engraved with a hex mark. At the top of the tower, a man (Julian Sands) is chained, including a peculiar shackle that locks his thumbs to his big toes. The man is to be executed for 'trafficking with the Devil,' and is being offered a final chance to confess his sins before man and God. However, the warlock is completely unrepentant and does not speak to the jailer or elders. The elders leave to continue preparing for the execution.Entering the cell next is a stoic man named Giles Redferne (Richard E. Grant), a witch hunter who helped capture the warlock. He gloats over the warlock's meeting a well-deserved fate, asking whether Satan would have saved the warlock yet, if he wanted to at all. The warlock slyly suggests that Satan may yet save them both. Giles kicks him in the face, knocking him onto his back and says he'll watch the warlock die tomorrow. The warlock tells him to believe it on seeing it... tomorrow.As Giles leaves, he warns the jailer that the thumb locks must not be removed from the warlock even during or after the execution; not until his corpse has completely finished burning to ash. But even as he speaks, there are sounds of a storm brewing. As Giles exits the tower, a powerful, clearly unnatural storm breaks over the village, and Giles notes it is centered over the warlock's prison tower. Giles rushes into the cell to find the warlock free of his shackles and channeling a powerful spell. The warlock disappears into the storm with Giles following behind him.Cut to modern day Los Angeles, California. We hear a radio broadcast about a storm breaking; one nicknamed, 'The Devil's Wind.' A funnel of air is seen heading toward a suburban house. A blonde woman, Kassandra (Lori Singer) is turning over in her bed, asleep until the sound of a breaking window jolts her awake. She goes to investigate, quickly joined by Chas (Kevin O'Brien), the owner of the house, from whom she rents her room. They find the warlock lying unconscious on the floor of the living room.Chas goes to call the police to get an ambulance, but the winds have knocked down phone lines throughout the area. He and Kassandra half-pull, half-carry him to Kassandra's room. Kassandra is wary but Chas wants to show the strange arrival some compassion.Morning arrives and Kassandra is dressing and preparing for work. She is a diabetic and must take regular injections of insulin.Going back to her room, she sees the warlock is awake and slyly suggests he stop drinking. As she asks if there's someone he can call, as the phones are working again, the warlock is staring in amazement at a weekly newspaper on her desk, dated March 4-10, 1988. He asks if that could truly be the year, though it appears he is talking to himself as much as Kassandra. She is amused at his voice inflections, noting he speaks, ""English English."" She gently presses him back down on the bed and tells him to rest. On the road, driving to work, Kassandra is shown to be both a bit careless in her driving, not always watching the road, and a bit vain, praying she never gets old.Back at the house, Chas is cooking a meal. Picking up a knife he's dropped, he's briefly started on seeing the warlock's reflection. The warlock just smiles politely and stands silently in the kitchen while Chas talks to him. He notices the warlock looking at a ring on his finger, and says it's his birth sign,Scorpio, but nobody believes in astrology anymore, which surprises the warlock. Suddenly the warlock grabs a knife and hacks Chas's finger off, taking the ring. Chas screams for help, but the warlock gestures and the kitchen door closes, trapping Chas in the kitchen. Donning the ring, the warlock grabs Chas and bites his tongue out, spitting it into the skillet.Kassandra is seen at work as a waitress at a small coffee shop. A police cruiser arrives in front. A police detective asks Kassandra questions about Chas, telling her the coroner's notes on the cause of his death. He asks Kassandra for the names of Chas's lovers. Kassandra tells the detective that Chas was gay.Over at a bookstore selling books on the metaphysical, a group is leaving after conversation with a spirit, happy at the results of the spirit channeling. The Channeler (Mary Woronov) starts to close up when she sees the warlock in the shop. He asks her to channel a spirit for him. She is allured at his charismatic nature and agrees to his request.The Channeler begins the private channeling for the spirit that the warlock said had many names, one of which was Zamiel. As the Channeler completes the summoning, the warlock immediately sees through the ritual and notes that she is a fraud. But he only says that he wishes to wait for the true Zamiel to appear. Trying to keep up the charade, the Channeler says the warlock must cast aside his skepticism. But suddenly she begins to gasp and choke. Her hands almost involuntarily close around a crystal, and it shatters. Her head falls forward onto the table, and then snaps back up, and her face has become demonic; her teeth huge and like shark's teeth. The warlock asks why he was brought to this place and time. Zamiel, speaking through the Channeler, tells the warlock to bring together his ""Bible,"" which has been divided into three parts. The warlock is amazed to hear that this book, which he calls the Grand Grimoire, is here, now. Very interested, he asks what reward was in store for him if he succeeded in retaking the book - which he understands, can ""thwart Creation itself."" Zamiel tells the warlock that if he succeeds, he shall become Satan's one begotten son. His eyes will guide the warlock. The Channeler then collapses face-first back onto the table. The warlock picks up a shard from the crystal and lifts the Channeler's head back up. She is dead and her face has reverted to normal. The warlock uses the sharp edge of the broken crystal shard to remove her eyes, and they are shown to be moving - a guide for the warlock.Kassandra arrives home, not quite comfortable in the house now that Chas has been murdered. She closes a door, and a shadow appears from a sliver of light behind it as she walks away. Going to her room, Kassandra starts to gather her things, deciding to leave the house. The sound of shattering glass attracts her attention.Going to investigate, she sees a cat run across the hall. Relieved, she resumes packing, but then sees Giles Redferne in the doorway. She screams in fear, and he rushes to cover her mouth, holding up the thumb-lock device, demanding to know if the one who wore these bled at all, anywhere. She screams again and he slaps her face. She tries to punch him, but he grabs her and drags her to the kitchen where a police chalk outline still shows where Chas was found. Giles tells Kassandra that he can find 'the beast' if he knows if his blood was spilled. Kassandra finally realizes that Giles is talking about the warlock and finally admits that he had been cut. Giles asks her to show him where. Kassandra goes to the vacuum cleaner and empties out the dust bag. Sifting through the dust, Giles finds a shard of broken glass with blood on it. He fiddles with it, using his dagger, saying it may do. He scrapes the dried blood from the shard into a small glass vial.While he works, Kassandra sneaks into the next room and calls the police. She tells them there is an intruder, and she doesn't know what to make of him, but he ""has a thing for blood-- draw your own conclusions."" The operator traces her call and gets her address and tells her a car is on the way. Kassandra says she's fleeing the house, though she doesn't get far after hanging up before Giles grabs her, now wanting to know where her water well is. Amused despite her fear, at the man asking for a water well, she takes him to the bathroom and shows him how to use the sink. He puts a little bit of water into the vial with the blood. She watches, perplexed, as he sets up a strange device. At her query, he explains it is a witch compass and she understands that he is hunting the blond man who had been in the house, and Giles says that this man was a warlock. He puts a drop of the blood onto the compass, saying that the compass will point in the warlock's direction. Kassandra watches, now interested, but mocks Giles when the device doesn't appear to work. Giles tells her to give it time, as the blood was thin, but Kassandra hears the arrival of the police squad car and tells him that he doesn't have any time. Giles rushes to the door and is taken aback at the automobiles, something he's seeing for the first time and has no idea what they are. He goes outside, not understanding who the officers are. The police order him to freeze. Thinking he is being attacked, Giles uses his whip to try and defend himself, but an officer subdues him with a taser gun.Giles spouts about the warlock's evil as he is loaded into the squad car. The lead officer tells Kassandra they'll take him down to the station, and advises her to leave the house. Kassandra is very agreeable to this and rushes to resume packing her things.Hurrying between the house and her car, stuffing as much as will fit into the car, Kassandra grabs some things from the bathroom. But the needle of Giles' witch compass, still resting on the bathroom counter top, suddenly begins to move, and she notices. Approaching the door, Kassandra freezes in fear on spotting the warlock just outside, holding a pair of disembodied eyes in one hand-- eyes that seem to move on their own. She rushes to close and lock the door, and rushes back to her phone to call the police again. This time however she only reaches the automated hold system. She sees the witch compass needle begin to spin and drops the phone in fear. She rushes to secure all the doors and windows of the house, but she is too late as the warlock is behind her.The warlock drags her by her hair into the living room, watching the disembodied eyes in his other hand. They lead him to an antique coffee table, and he sweeps everything off of it. Kassandra runs to the bathroom and locks herself inside as the warlock smashes the table apart, finding a sheaf of papers inside which are covered in strange writing and drawings. Inside the bathroom, Kassandra tries to open the shutters and escape through the window. Suddenly the warlock's hand smashes through and grabs her wrist. Screaming in terror, Kassandra yanks her wrist free and loses her balance, falling to the floor and hitting her head, knocking herself out. The warlock had managed to grab the charm bracelet off of her wrist. Holding it, he sticks his head through the window and recites a dire chant before leaving.Morning comes before Kassandra comes to. Struggling to regain her bearings, she realizes that her hair has grown far far longer than she keeps it cut. Rushing to look at herself in the mirror, she finds to her horror that she looks about twenty years older.Kassandra is leaving the police station with Giles, having bailed him out of jail. She realizes that the warlock put a spell on her to age her from twenty years old to forty, and she needs Giles' help as he seems to know a great deal about the warlock. Driving down the street, Giles is completely dumbfounded at the world around him. He explains to Kassandra that he and the warlock are from the year 1691 and a time portal brought them 300 years into the future without explanation.Back at the house, Giles is examining the broken table. Kassandra stops him and asks how they fix her age. He asks if the warlock took a small, personal object from her, and she remembers that he took her charm bracelet. Giles says the only way to break the hex is to regain the bracelet from the warlock. Kassandra is too frightened to pursue the warlock and tells him he must go on his own. Giles warns her that the spell placed on her is not complete, but progressive. Each day she will age another 20 years - meaning within two days, three at most, she will die of old age.Kassandra and Giles are preparing to pursue the warlock, though Kassandra makes it clear that she's only looking to reclaim her bracelet - whatever quarrel Giles has with the warlock, as far as she is concerned, is between them and none of her business. Giles nods curtly and they start off.As the warlock walks across the mesa, studying the papers he took from the broken table, Giles is busying himself coating his whip with salt taken from the house. He explains to Kassandra that salt is taboo to witches. Again we see Kassandra's careless driving style as Giles must grab the wheel to steer the car away from the wrong side of the road - and away from an onrushing truck.A young boy is playing with a football in a small trailer park. He throws it and is surprised to see a man catch the football - the warlock. The boy takes the warlock to the nearby playground, and shows him how to play a hand-held football video game. The warlock is distracted by the sound of singing and music. The boy explains that it's coming from the church a few dozen yards behind them. The warlock asks the boy why he's not at church, and he tells the warlock that he never goes to church, because his dad hates all things about Jesus Christ and the 12 Apostrophes. The boy then asks the warlock why he doesn't attend church, and the warlock says that witches cannot set foot on church grounds. The boy thought witches were girls, but the warlock tells him that some are men. The boy asks where the warlock's flying broomstick is. The warlock says he needs no broomstick to fly. When asked what he does need, the warlock just laughs and gently pushes the swing that the boy is sitting on.Kassandra pulls into a roadside gas station to refill her gas tank. Giles sets up the witch compass while the car is being refilled and notes the needle moving in the direction of the park. Gunshots are heard, and the station attendant explains that local residents are hunting coyote, because a small boy in the nearby trailer park was killed by one. The attendant says that coyotes are known to do that in this part of the state, and the boy was badly chewed up, his skin taken clean off.Kassandra and Giles head to the trailer park where they see the hunters dropping the corpse of a coyote they'd killed on the ground. A small crowd is gathered, murmuring. Giles notices one woman's reaction, and her face as she walks away. He rushes after her, asking if she is the boy's mother. When she acknowledges that she is, he offers her his sympathy, and asks if he was baptized. She's shocked that he asked her that question, but she responds: ""No, his father wouldn't allow it."" and walks away. Giles' face turns very grimGiles suspects the warlock is the boy's murderer, and he explains to Kassandra that of all the various spell reagents used by witches, the most precious is human fat - and if that fat is cut from a male child that has not been baptized, there is one thing it would be used for: a flying potion.At night, Giles' grim words prove true, as the warlock cooks the fat in a small metal can over a flame that burns blue. After he drinks the foul-tasting brew, a police officer on speeding stakeout is dumbfounded at the sight of a strange man flying through the air at incredible speed.Kassandra is trying to make small talk with Giles to pass the time as they travel down the road. She is startled by his sudden question on why she paints her face. She tries to explain that in modern times, makeup is considered perfectly acceptable. Giles blurts out that if: ""My Marion had-"" and suddenly stops, saying only that in the 17th century, women didn't wear make-up unless they practiced witchcraft. Kassandra realizes that Giles had accidentally let slip something he didn't want to talk about - he was married. She tries to press for more information when Giles insists they stop the car so he can get new bearings via the compass. Kassandra chastises herself as Giles sets the compass up on the road... and then realizes she is feeling very ill. Giles notices her stumbling out of the car, and she begs him to leave her by the road and go on without her. Her voice has changed drastically. Midnight has passed, and Kassandra has aged to sixty years old. Giles can only comfort her.Morning comes, and the warlock has secreted himself in the attic of a farmhouse. He is studying the papers, and is pleased at his new-found ability to create and control witch-fire. Even hidden, however, the warlock's very presence alters the environment around him - the farmer's father goes to tell him that the cream has gone bad, which puzzles the farmer as he only brought it in yesterday. He asks his father to bring out one of the horses, and the father finds the horse deeply agitated, and wet. Walking toward the house, he notices the attic's door onto the roof is ajar. Watching his young grandchildren run by, racing each other, the elderly man takes paint and a paintbrush, and begins painting something on the barn.Kassandra and Redferne are passing the state border into Colorado. Kassandra finally gets Giles to tell her about Marion. She realizes that this is why he is pursuing the warlock - he killed his wife.They are passing by the farm and Giles is shocked to see a hex mark painted on the side of the barn, and the witch compass needle moves to point toward it. Giles urges Kassandra to stop and begins running toward the farm. The witch compass is broken by the hard stop, but Giles says that if God is with them, they won't need it any longer.They rush into the house and confront the farmer, who was the son an Amish man and a Mennonite, saying that they are bewitched. The farmer is startled and wary at the intrusion until his father comes into the room, saying he painted the mark, and they are bewitched. He and Giles shake hands in a comradely fashion, and he takes Giles to show him the ajar attic door. Giles has the Mennonite retrieve nails and a hammer, which he uses to nail the door shut. Back in the house, the farmer and his wife are still amazed at how his father is giving Giles almost free run on the property. Giles says that if children are present, to take them away. The Mennonite agrees and urges his son and daughter-in-law to take the kids and go. A horse that sweats in the morning, cream that sours overnight-- even his son, a modern-day farmer, has learned the signs that the Mennonite recognizes and believes in.The farmer and his wife take the kids and drive off. Giles is preparing to enter the attic from the retractable staircase connecting it to the farmhouse's hallway. He gives Kassandra and the Mennonite copper pennies to hold between their lips, as a ward against errant magic. On his word they are to close the steps and brace the door shut, and not re-open it until he says it is okay.Pulling his whip and bodkin knife, Giles enters the attic. He's startled by a flying bat and quickly slays it. Noting a small window braced open, he knows the warlock was - or still is there. Looking around, he finds a broken piece of furniture, and a piece of paper inside, covered with drawings and writing. He quietly reads a few words from the paper, then tears it in half and puts the pieces on the floor. As the two pieces begin to move toward each other and reform into a single full sheet, Giles realizes with horror that it is a page from the Grand Grimoire. He rushes to the stairs to tell Kassandra and the Mennonite about it-- the Grand Grimoire, an indestructible book of black magic said to be authored by Satan himself-- his bible. The Grimoire was last held by the West End church in Boston. Giles had urged them to divide the book into three parts to prevent witches from seizing it and gaining access to all of its secrets, but the pages were supposed to be kept on hallowed ground. Kassandra interrupts him, asking where the warlock is. Giles says, exasperated, that he's fled. But Kassandra points out that if the Grimoire was so precious to witches, why would he leave even a single page behind? Realizing Kassandra's point, he shouts for them to close the steps.Giles rushes back into the center of the attic, ready for battle, when the warlock lands to confront him. Giles shouts for the Mennonite to fix the brace, which the warlock scoffs at, pointing out he can now fly. Giles promptly uncoils his whip, yanking out the small brace in the window to close it. He then advances on the warlock and jams his bodkin deep into the warlock's middle. But he finds to his dismay that the warlock had placed the Grimoire pages under his shirt, and they acted as armor; the deep tear in the pages mending instantaneously. The warlock marvels at how even just two-thirds of the Grimoire could do this. He then counterattacks with a bolt of witch fire, causing Gilles to bust through the nailed attic door and tumble out onto the ground. Retrieving the page left behind, the warlock steps out onto the roof and with his magic, causes the weather vane to break loose from the roof and hurtle at Giles like a spear. It narrowly misses, and Giles coils his whip around the warlock's ankle as he starts to fly off. The warlock drags him across the farm and flies into the barn, where Giles collides with the barn wall and loses his grip. Kassandra and the Mennonite regroup with him, having retrieved the weather vane, which Giles holds ready. When the warlock re-emerges, Giles hurls it like a javelin, nailing the warlock in the back and forcing him to land. The three pounce on him, pull his boots off and hold him down, where Giles scrambles to affix the thumb-toe locks. Kassandra scrambles to recover her bracelet, but finds only the Channeler's eyes, which she tosses away in disgust. The warlock finds his avenue of escape - he stares into the Mennonite's eyes. Giles notices, but too late - the warlock has placed a vile hex that is causing the Mennonite's eyes to bleed. Feeling the warlock has slain too many, he lets go of him to tend to the stricken Mennonite. The warlock is able to hobble and hop away, the locks not completely in place.Giles calls for brass keys to remove the hex. He also gives Kassandra the hammer and remaining nails, saying that if she finds footprints from the warlock, to hammer the nails into the ground there. Kassandra is furiously angry at the thought of facing the warlock with a simple nail, but Giles insists she go and do as he says - the warlock can be crippled that way.Kassandra heads off, finding her way to a railway station near the farmhouse. She discovers foot prints made from a bare foot and hammers the nails into the dirt. She hears the warlock scream in agony, and we see him holding his feet as he hides in a railway car. Kassandra drives a nail into another foot print, but this time there is no scream-- the warlock had ripped a plank up from the railway car and is holding it against his feet like a shield. But then Kassandra finds an indentation made in a small pile of dirt, by the warlock's head when he stumbled and fell while removing the thumb-lock device. She drives a nail in and the warlock falls unconscious. His arm dangles limply out of the car and Kassandra sees her charm bracelet around the warlock's wrist. But the railway car begins moving, and Kassandra's supernaturally-aged, sixty-year-old body struggles desperately to catch up. She finally manages to grab the warlock's wrist, but the warlock comes to and grabs her wrist in return. She hits his hand with the hammer, causing him to lose his grip and her to fall to the ground. She watches in dismay as the train carries the warlock off... but then notes that the hammer pulled her charm bracelet off the warlock's wrist, and both hammer and bracelet lie on the ground just a few feet in front of her.Giles has finished treating the Mennonite's eyes and covered them with a dressing. He has placed the brass keys above his head, to be spun clockwise once per hour. By morning the hex would be gone and his eyes recovered. He hears Kassandra ask about the Mennonite. Only her silhouette is visible from the darkened entrance to the bedroom. Giles offers no excuse other than his wish to save just one life that the warlock would have otherwise taken. Saying she understands, Kassandra steps into the light, showing that the hex on her is likewise broken and her body has been restored to its original youth at twenty years of age.They are heading back to Kassandra's car, Giles saying that it is easy enough to gather brass, copper and glass to rebuild the compass. The most important thing is the weather vane, which has a new supply of the warlock's blood. But Kassandra wants no further part of the witch hunt now that she is restored to normal. She hands Giles her car keys and credit card, wishing him well. He grabs her and she protests that the deal was only until she got her bracelet back. Having never learned Kassandra's name, he asks her for it, and proceeds to tell her that her life is still in grievous danger - in fact all life is, now that he knows what the warlock is up to. The warlock has recovered two portions of the Grand Grimoire. If he gains the third part and completes the book, he will gain access to its ultimate secret-- the lost, true name of God. This true name was invoked during Creation... and witches claim that if the true name of God were to be pronounced in reverse, and spoken backward, all of Creation would also reverse - Earth and the universe would be destroyed. Kassandra groans in dismay. She is terrified of the warlock, and it shows plainly. On the next confrontation, there would be no spells or hexes-- she is sure that next time, the warlock would kill her. Giles promises to protect her as he holds out the car keys.Driving down the road again, Kassandra has come up with a plan. The Grimoire was last kept by the West End Church in Boston. Instead of playing tag, as she explains to Giles, they should play ""leap frog"" instead - hurry to get to Boston before the warlock and make sure the last pages are safe on hallowed ground. They drive to the airport and Kassandra calls Operator Assistance to get the West End Church's address. Kassandra gives the ticket agent her credit card, but when the agent is distracted by another customer asking a quick question, Kassandra stealthily unplugs the card reader.Noticing that the plane Kassandra speaks of is able to fly through the air like a bird, Giles is very nervous, thinking that flying machines were a form of witchcraft. Kassandra suddenly notices Giles still has the weather vane attached to his back. She tries to grab it away, arguing he wouldn't be allowed on the plane with it. But suddenly she sees the warlock in the airport-- the warlock was no fool, and had figured out how to beat them at their own game. She shoves the vane back into Giles' hands and drags him off to the plane. On board, during the evening, Kassandra tries to get Giles to settle down and sleep. But he notices another passenger putting cream in his coffee and noticing it is spoiled, and another passenger lighting a cigarette with a cigarette lighter, and the flame is pure blue. Giles believes these are signs of a witch's presence. Kassandra tries to calm him, and he realizes that she saw the warlock in the airport and didn't tell him. He insists they look for the warlock on the plane, but the warlock has secreted himself in the baggage hold in the plane's underside, out of sight.The plane lands in Boston. Airport agents open the baggage hold door and are startled at what looks like a man flying out. Cut to Kassandra and Giles in a taxicab, hoping to find the church. Boston has changed considerably in the last 300 years and Giles isn't sure the church's location is still the same, or if it even exists anymore. Recalling his knowledge of certain landmarks as best he can, Giles manages to aid the cab driver in finding the correct church. They arrive just as the Pastor of the Church is closing up. The Pastor is looking to get home, but when Giles says he needs to speak about the Grand Grimoire, he re-opens the doors and brings them inside.The Pastor says that Church documents aren't for sale, thinking that they are collectors of old documents. Kassandra says that they just need to find the book. The Pastor says it is long gone, divided up and-- he is interrupted by wind blowing the doors open, which alerts Giles that thw warlock is around. Closing the doors again, the Pastor inquires into their interest in the Grimoire, and is shocked at Giles' explanation.He retrieves and opens an old folder of Church papers going back to 1692 and detailing the separation of the Grand Grimoire. One part was placed within the hollow of a table used in taking communion. The second part was given to a vicar who had founded a ministry west of the Carolinas, placed within an armoire. Over the years and centuries as witchcraft was forgotten and people no longer believed in it, these objects ended up sold and donated, re-sold and re-donated, until the table ended up at Chas's house, and the armoire in the Mennonite's attic. As for the third part... the Pastor says it should still be in Boston.Kassandra and Giles are walking down the road. The last part of the book is in an old graveyard that Giles remembers existing even back in his day. The layout of the town is very different, but some subtle similarities remain. He manages to locate the graveyard, saying that if the ground there is consecrated, then the pages are safe, for the warlock can never set foot there.Meanwhile, the Pastor is back home. His wife alerts him to a sound she's heard. They both note that the door is rattling and shaking-- in fact the whole house is shaking. The crucifix falls off the wall. Finally the bolts in the door's hinges slip out. The rumbling stops and the warlock pushes the door open from the hinged side. He forces the Pastor and his wife into chairs. With only a touch to the wife's breast he sees that she is pregnant with twins. The warlock's request is simple: knowledge of what the Pastor discussed with Giles and Kassandra, in exchange for the unborn children's lives.Kassandra and Giles make it to the cemetery. Giles jabs the weather vane into the ground, and it starts to shake from the warlock's blood which is still on the sharp barb at the vane's top-- a sign that the ground is consecrated and the warlock cannot tread on it. Still, he needs to know the pages are there, and therefore protected. The Pastor had told Giles to look for a grave with a hex mark which will show where the final part of the Grimoire is buried. Kassandra finds the marked grave, but covers the inscription with her arms and tries to stop Giles from looking. Suspicious, he pushes her away, and stops in sick horror on finding his own name - Giles Redferne - inscribed on the tombstone.Kassandra is following Giles out when she notices several empty grave lots and signs of digging and construction. She follows it to a sign partially obscured by bushes. She pushes them aside and sees it is a notice about the cemetery being remodeled and graves being moved as part of a project to modify the cemetery's layout in order to accommodate a building project for new condominiums. Alarmed, she tells Giles about the sign and explains that maybe the remodeling projects means that Giles' grave was relocated as well... and that the ground there is not part of the original cemetery, and therefore not hallowed.Kassandra uses the weather vane as a gauge... and finds that the ground where Giles' grave has been moved to, is indeed not consecrated... meaning the warlock can go there and open the grave without fear. He looks toward the grave with an expression of dread - clearly the thought of seeing his own remains terrifies him.Kassandra takes on the task of opening Giles' coffin herself. She finds a skeleton inside clutching a sheaf of paper. The fingers of the skeleton are clasped around the last part of the Grimoire in such a way that she is forced to break them off in order to free the papers. Giles accidentally turns around and recoils in horror.The two are on their way out of the cemetery when the Warlock appears, flying at them and levitating over the ground. Giles hurls the weather vane like a spear, but the Warlock dodges it, and it goes flying off into thick brush. Gilesseparates the papers into two stacks, giving Kassandra one half, saying they should split up in hopes of keeping the Warlock from reclaiming the entire Grimoire. But the Warlock is too smart for this. He corners Kassandra and tortures her, pulling off her sneaker and slowly driving a nail into her foot, sarcastically thanking Giles for giving him the idea. He digs the nail in deeper to make Kassandra scream in agony, and tells Giles that he will make her suffer far worse than Marion ever suffered, unless Giles emerges from the safety of the consecrated ground and hands over the last pages of the Grimoire. Giles points out that far more than just Kassandra's life is at stake, and the Warlock scoffs, saying that only the truly daft believe in the stories of the ""Uncreation."" He issues a final ultimatum for Giles to surrender the pages.Giles puts the pages down on the ground, putting a small stone over them as a paperweight, and challenges the Warlock to fight him hand to hand, no spells or magic, to claim them. He answers the Warlock's retort that he gives up nothing, by pulling out his own weapons and throwing them to either side. The Warlock begins producing witch fire that dances between his hands, and Giles slyly suggests that without his magic, he is afraid. But afraid or not, the Warlock steps forward and he and Giles fight hand to hand. Giles starts to gain an advantage when he pushes the Warlock's head down onto the consecrated ground, burning him. Deciding that two can play that game, the Warlock answers by pushing his hand against Giles' face and sending a bolt of witch fire right into his mouth. Kassandra grabs Giles' whip and tries to garrote the Warlock with it, but he punches her with the back of his fist and hurls her into the river bordering the cemetery. Giles makes a last rush, but the Warlock uses his magic to throw him back, where he lands right atop his own coffin and looks, up close, at his own remains, causing him to scream in horror.Kassandra is starting to climb onto the riverbank when she stops, tasting something on her tongue. Fumbling with her purse, she grabs her insulin needles and climbs back down into the river.The Warlock triumphantly gathers up the last pages and recites a dark chant that causes all the pages of the Grimoire to reunite and form a complete book, which cracks the ground it lands on. A storm begins to break as the Warlock commands the Grimoire to reveal to him, the hidden name of God. Lightning flashes down and strikes the Grimoire, and invisible markings become visible, snaking and twisting into lines that form into letters spelling out a name: Rokisha or Roaisha.As thunder begins to rage, the Warlock cries out in triumph, shouting to God that he knows Him now; knows His true name-- the word that can undo all that He has wrought. But before he can shout the name out and pronounce it backward, Kassandra jumps on his back, clapping her hand over the Warlock's mouth, and jams her insulin needles into his neck. The Warlock easily throws her off with a hitch of his shoulder and pulls the needles out... and Kassandra triumphantly shouts for him to try saltwater.The salt in the river water injected into the warlock's body begins to destroy him from the inside out. His death-throes and agony are so great he cannot shout out God's name in reverse. He catches fire and burns alive in mid-air, finally sinking to the ground as a charred corpse. As Giles stands over the corpse, the burned skull suddenly begins to move as if to make one last effort at achieving the Warlock's goal, but Giles steps on the skull and crushes it.Giles thanks Kassandra for her heroism, saying that he is in her debt. He seems to be leaning in as if to kiss her, and Kassandra closes her eyes and slightly puckers her lips. A light breeze blows over her, and she opens her eyes to find Giles gone, and sees a small funnel of whirling air moving slowly toward his grave, where it adds to the writing already on the tombstone, ""I will remember you always 'til time and times are done."" Kassandra is visibly moved by the new inscription, but then happens to turn and spot the Grand Grimoire, still lying on the ground, and she says, ""Oh... shoot.""Cut to Kassandra burying the Grimoire in what appears to be snow... all around, is pure white. However, she is wearing only a light white tank-top shirt and no jacket, showing the weather is warm. She finishes burying the Grimoire and puts her shovel back into her car, then gets in and drives off, cheering. The camera pans out to show a large sign that reveals the location-- and resting place of the Grand Grimoire-- as the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwestern Utah... the world's largest deposit of natural salt."
Scandal,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098260/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the Profumo Scandal of 1963, an affair between an exotic dancer and the Minister of War shakes up the British government. An English bon-vivant osteopath is enchanted with a young exotic dancer and invites her to live with him. He serves as friend and mentor, and through his contacts and parties she and her friend meet and date members of the Conservative Party. Eventually a scandal occurs when her affair with the Minister of War goes public, threatening their lifestyles and their freedom. Based on the real Profumo scandal of 1963.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> London, England 1959Osteopath Dr. Stephen Ward (John Hurt) visits a local burlesque club where he spots Christine Keeler (Joann Walley-Kilmer), a gorgeous underage nightclub performer, and unsuccessfully attempts to get her telephone number.One week later, Christine is visiting her working class family in the countryside when Stephen drives up in his sports car and takes her to a large Tudor style cottage on the grounds of Lord William Astor's (Leslie Phillips) estate. Stephen explains that 'Bill' Astor lets him rent the cottage for only one British pound per year because he lets Astor cheat him at bridge. As Stephen gives Christine a tour of Cliveden, the large Astor manor, he explains that only people born to wealth and nobility, or the very beautiful, are invited to mingle with high society. He offers to tutor her for such a life.Soon, Stephen takes control of Christine's look, turning her from a peroxide blonde to a brunette, and changing her clothes from ""SoHo chic"" to ""Covent Garden sexy."" One night a few months later in October, after a party celebrating the Conservative Party winning Britain's general election, Stephen invites a few politicians to his apartment for an orgy. After getting over her initial shock, Christine joins in.The next night, Christine enters the nightclub dressing room to find Mandy Rice-Davies (Bridget Fonda), a cool blonde, sitting in her makeup chair. Christine orders her to move, but Mandy refuses until the other girls gang up on her. Later, the girls dress as ""Indians"" for a dance number. Someone steals Mandy's top, but Christine observes that the girl is so slight, no one will notice. During the number, a frustrated Mandy appears topless, upstaging Christine. After the show, Christine overhears Mandy lying to her mother over the phone about how exciting the nightclub is. When Mandy hangs up, Christine asks her out for a drink and the two of them become close friends.Afterward, Christine is helping Mandy sneak her possessions out of her flat when they are caught by the landlady. Christine runs outside, where Lord Astor is waiting in his Rolls Royce. Pretending to cry, Christine embarrasses Astor into giving Mandy a check for 40 pounds to keep the landlady from calling the police. Mandy moves in with Christine and Stephen at his house, who parades the two girls before his wealthy friends at parties and other social events.At one party, Stephen introduces Christine and Mandy to Eugene Ivanov (Jeroen Krabbe), a naval military attache for the Soviet embassy. On another night, the girls go to ""Club 21."" There, they meet an American ""Matinee Idol"" (Trevor Eve) (loosely based on actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr.; one of Christine and Mandy's many clients). After pantomiming lesbian sex, they engage in a menage à trois with the Matinee Idol.In July 1961, Stephen's friendship with Ivanov catches the attention of a certain ""Mr. Woods"" (Oliver Ford Davies), a high-ranking member of British Military Intelligence (MI5), who asks Stephen to keep an eye on the Soviet attache which MI5 believes to be a spy. Stephen invites Ivanov to Cliveden for a dinner party, where Christine can be seen diving into the swimming pool. When Lord Astor leads his dinner guest, Minister of War John Profumo (Ian McKellan) to Cliveden, they find Christine dancing naked for Stephen and Ivanov. Christine tries to run inside the house, but Profumo catches her. They stare at each other in silence until flood lights are turned on to reveal Lady Astor, Valerie Profumo, and others of Astor's party guests. Mrs. Profumo wraps a towel around Christine and separates the girl from her husband.Throughout the summer, Stephen throws parties at Cliveden which Ivanov and Profumo vie for Christine's attentions. One day, Stephen arranges for Ivanov to drive Christine to London to his row house, and the two end up in bed for the first time. When Stephen finds out, he calls Mr. Woods at MI5 to report it. The next day, Profumo arrives and takes Christine on a drive through London. Stephen is disappointed when Christine reports back that Profumo was a complete gentleman, but lightens up when she predicts he will call her soon.That night, Stephen and a friend drive Christine to a Jamaican club in East London to procure marijuana. Fearing he looks too much like someone from ""Scotland Yard,"" Stephen sends Christine to talk to Lucky Gordon (Leon Herbert), a tall Jamaican. Lucky only agrees to the sale if Christine accompanies him inside the club. As Stephen and his friend smoke marijuana, Christine dances with Lucky. That night, she makes love to him in his flat.Some time later, Christine has her first sexual encounter with Profumo. During one of their trysts, Lucky telephones and asks to see Christine, but she hangs up and tells Profumo it is the nightclub owner asking about the show. Over the next several months, Christine is happy balancing her affairs with Ivanov, Profumo, and a few other men. However, Profumo worries that he will be recognized going to Stephen's house. He tells Christine she cannot trust Stephen, so unless she finds another apartment for herself, their affair is over. Insisting that Stephen cannot live without her, Christine then ends the affair with Profumo.Stephen tells Christine that she made a mistake breaking up with Profumo, as Profumo will be Prime Minister someday. Irate, Christine yells that she is sick and tired of being given to old men as well as being exploited by Stephen who clearly doing everything he can to to grease his way up the top of the social ladder of high society.Some time later, Christine takes Mandy with her for a night out at the Jamaican club. There, she seduces a Jamaican gangster named Johnnie Edgecombe (Roland Gift), but when they wind up in bed at his flat, Lucky appears and attacks the other man in a jealous rage. Johnnie pulls out a razor blade and gashes Lucky's cheek. Terrified, Christine rushes back to Stephen's house to hide out. She is amused to find Mandy in Stephen's bed.Two months later in December 1962, Johnnie appears outside Stephen's house one day, demanding Christine run away with him before Lucky can take his revenge. When Christine refuses, Johnnie pulls out a revolver and shoots at the door, but cannot break the door down. After he leaves, Christine and Mandy are brought to the police station for questioning about the shooting incident after Johnnie's arrest and they are both questioned at how much they both know about the suspect or why he would try to harm them.That evening, Stephen meets Christine at the station after the police release her. Stephen tells Christine that she is out of control with her behavior and urges both her and Mandy to move out before they destroy his reputation. Christine counters that Stephen brought her to the Jamaican club, the orgies and sex parties; therefore, she is what he made her. Stephen refuses to take responsibility for her actions and leaves her standing alone outside in the evening rain. A reporter named Kevin (Keith Allen) approaches and asks her to accompany him for a cup of tea to ask her questions about the suspect Johnnie Edgecombe. The distraught Christine admits to the Profumo affair, insisting it was Stephen's fault. Kevin calls his editor at the Sunday Pictorial to let him know he has stumbled onto a huge story. The next day, Christine's picture is on the front page of every London newspaper as part of the developing story.A little later in January 1963, Stephen privately meets with Ivanov at a local park, who tells Stephen that he is being recalled to the Soviet Union for his sexual involvement with Christine. Ivanov warns Stephen that the British government will make him the scapegoat for all this, but Stephen literally laughs it off and predicts the whole affair will be forgotten in a week.Meanwhile, Christine is temporarily living with Mandy and another woman at a small apartment. At Mandy's urging, Christine signs a news contract to sell her story. When the story becomes a media sensation, Christine leaves the country for an extended stay in Europe to hide out with the money she makes from selling her story about her sexual affairs with various men in the British government.In March 1963, to counter the rumors circulating among the public, Profumo makes a personal statement, assuring the House of Commons that there was no ""impropriety"" in his relationship with Christine. To control the situation, Lord Hailsham (Iain Cuthbertson), a Conservative Party leader, contacts Scotland Yard to investigate Stephen. Soon, friends and acquaintances are being detained and questioned.Stephen meets with Hailsham at his office and appeals to call off the ""witch-hunt"", warning that he will be forced to defend his reputation by revealing the truth (implying that Hailsham was also involved in the sex and drug orgies that Stephen had set up). Unfazed, Hailsham warns him that it is illegal to blackmail a government official. Afterwords, Stephen telephones Mr. Woods at MI5 for assistance, but the man refuses his calls. Later at a local tea room, Lord Astor asks Stephen to move out of the cottage.After returning from Europe to visit her family back in England, Christine is interrogated by police who accuse her of being a prostitute with Stephen as her pimp. She argues that Stephen is the only man she ever loved, and they are both innocent. Over the next several months, more revelations of sexual deviations of the rich and powerful are aired in the UK press. Questions of national security are raised when it is discovered that Christine was sleeping with both the Minister of War and a Soviet ""spy."" Profumo is forced to resign on June 5, 1963 after he publicly admits in a written letter that he lied about his sexual affair with Christine.Some time later, Christine visits the distraught Stephen at his house, and he confesses he always feared that someday his friends would betray him and that Ivanov was right about the British government making him a scapegoat for all this. He promises to drag down everyone if they come after him.Stephen is arrested and charged with procuring and living off immoral earnings and brought to a highly publicized trial. During the trial, Mandy and Christine are brought to testify against Stephen. Although Christine and Mandy testify they were not prostitutes, nor did they give Stephen money other than rent, the prosecution insists he lived off their ""wages of sin."" Later, Stephen's defense attorney cross-examines Christine and accuses her of using Stephen so she could sell her memoirs. Stephen disrupts the trial by yelling out ""that's not fair!"" Afterwords, Christine leaves the courthouse and is swarmed by mobs of reporters and photographers.

Troop Beverly Hills,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098519/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A soon to be divorced Beverly Hills socialite is determined to prove to her husband and herself that she can finish what she starts out to do, by becoming a den mother to a troop of Beverly Hills Girl Scouts. As Phyllis, a Beverly Hills housewife, is in the middle of a divorce, she tries to find focus in her life by taking over her daughter Hannah's Wilderness Girl troop. Among the girls are Tiffany, (who her father has to bribe to attend meetings, Emily (the daughter of an out of work actor, whose financial difficulties hinders her wanting to participate in certain activities), the neurotic Tessa (whose parents divorce has forced her into therapy twice a week), the hostile Chica (whose parents are too busy with their own lives to even remember her birthday), and Claire (the child star who see the wilderness girls as her chance to lead a ""normal"" life). Phyllis then begins to take the girls camping at a Beverly Hills hotel and earn patches relating to material things. The district leader, Velda, feels the troop should be disbanded. However, the head of the Wilderness girls organization believes that as long as Phyllis has taken an active interest in the girls, that is the only thing that's important. Then Velda begins to sabotage the girls endlessly.—Theresa Phyllis Nefler, a soon to be divorced Beverly Hills society wife is determined to prove to her husband Freddy and herself that she can finish what she starts out to do. She soon realizes that being a Wilderness Girls' den mother to a troop of Beverly Hills-bred girls is not as easy as buying cookies.—Michael Escober <m2e2@poboxes.com> At a Southern California Wilderness Girls of America board meeting, the militaristic Velda Plendor (Betty Thomas) votes to disband the Beverly Hills chapter, Troop 332, since the scouts consistently under-perform. However, the organization's leader, Frances Temple (Audra Lindley), allows troop Beverly Hills one last chance with its new leader, Phyllis Nefler (Shelley Long).Unknown to the board, Phyllis is a shallow, self-indulgent, compulsive shopper with expensive tastes, and is determined to bankrupt her husband, Fred (Craig T. Nelson), before their pending divorce. Although the couple's adolescent daughter, Hannah (Jenny Lewis), is delighted that Phyllis is her new Wilderness Girls troop leader, Fred doubts that his wife, who once scrimped and saved to start his now-successful car muffler business, can prioritize camping over shopping. Despite their antagonism, Phyllis secretly longs for Fred, who has taken up residence in the guesthouse on the property.Sometime later, Phyllis attends a training session lead by Velda Plendor. Dressed in a custom-made designer uniform and heedless of the Wilderness Girls's staunch codes of humility, Phyllis provokes Velda's crusade to get rid of troop Beverly Hills.The next day, Phyllis meets each of the new wealthy and spoiled Beverly Hills girls of her new group who include Hannah, Claire Sprantz (Ami Foster), Chica Barnfell (Carla Gugino), Tessa DiBlasio (Heather Hopper), Emily Coleman (Kelli Martin), Tiffany Honigman (Emily Schulman), the sole African-American girl Jasmine Shakar (Tasha Scott), the daughter of a Southeast Asian dictator Lily Marcigan (Aquilina Soriano), and finally Hannah Nefler (Jenny Lewis). Phyllis takes the girls to a campsite beneath the Hollywood sign, chauffeured in limousines. During a rainstorm, Phyllis relocates the girls to the Beverly Hills Hotel, where they share ghost stories around the fireplace.The next morning, Velda and her long-suffering sidekick, Annie Herman (Mary Gross), arrive at the hotel to berate Phyllis, claiming she has debased their wholesome organization. Although Velma fires Phyllis, the indomitable Beverly Hills troop leader later attends the Annual Wilderness Craft Day convention and leads her girls in a fashion show, but they are laughed offstage. Meanwhile, Velda secretly orders Anne to spy on troop Beverly Hills with a hidden camera, posing as an assistant leader.At the next troop meeting, Hannah and the other girls confess their discontent. In response, Phyllis promises to train the girls how to survive the ""wilderness"" of Beverly Hills and to earn Wilderness Girls patches based on their accomplishments. Responding to the ""Grooming,"" ""Create a Patch"", ""Dance,"" and ""Community Service"" mandates of the Wilderness Girls manual, Phyllis treats the young ladies to spa treatments, teaches them to appraise diamonds, leads them in dance moves, arranges cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training with a handsome police officer, and lets them entertain residents at a retirement home.Sometime later, Phyllis brings the troop to her divorce hearing to expose them to the U.S. legal system, and is devastated to learn that Fred is considering remarriage. The next day, Phyllis announces that the girls broke a record by earning 36 patches in three weeks, and plans a celebration aboard a dockside yacht. There, Hannah is decorated with her special ""Sushi Appreciation"" patch with parents Phyllis and Fred standing proudly on either side, but when they bend to kiss their daughter, Hannah ducks, hoping the soon-to-be divorcees will kiss each other. In the melee, Fred's fiancee, Lisa falls off the yacht.Sometime later, Velda proudly exhibits a slideshow of Annie's secret photographs to Frances, hoping to have troop Beverly Hills disbanded for good, while she lies and manipulates each event happening in each photo in a negative away. However, all Velda and Annie's spying has done is show Frances that while Phyllis may be unusual, she has taken an active interest in these girls and is trying to help them learn to survive their personal environment rather than the wilderness. In response, Velda orders Annie to move into the Nefler estate to uncover incriminating evidence, but Annie only witnesses Phyllis' kindness.
Troop Beverly Hills can gain recognition from the regional council by passing a series of tests at an upcoming Jamboree. In order to qualify, the troop needs to sell 1,000 boxes of cookies. To prevent this, Velda one-ups Troop Beverly Hills by selling cookies in their own neighborhood. Seeing this, Annie sides with Phyllis and offers her abilities and insider knowledge to the girls. Despite her unusual nature, Phyllis is beginning to learn at this point; for example, when her Hollywood friends ask her if they should solve the problem by buying the cookies, Phyllis points out that them doing that misses the entire point about building community-they may well end up going the glamour route to sell the cookies, but it's still a legitimate attempt to do it meaningfully, at least for Beverly Hills. The Troop's sales drive sells 4,732 boxes, more than enough to qualify for the Jamboree.In celebration, Phyllis invites Velda to a black tie gala. When Fred shows up unexpectedly, he compliments his wife for becoming troop leader of the year, and notices she has reverted to the virtuous girl he fell in love with. As Fred announces that his engagement to Vicki has ended, Phyllis suspects he wants to renew their vows, but instead he asks for joint custody of Hannah, and the distressed Phyllis falls into the pool.Later, Velda berates Phyllis and orders her to take the Wilderness Jamboree seriously. Depressed at the loss of her husband, Phyllis drowns her sorrows in Evian bottled water and announces her resignation from troop Beverly Hills. However, the girls insist she has been a positive role model, and beg her to stay. Just then, Fred arrives with Hannah, and encourages Phyllis to lead the girls to victory at the jamboree.Sometime later, troop Beverly Hills arrives at the jamboree campsite in convertible Rolls Royces, ready to outperform the Culver City girls. As the teams race off on their first challenge, Velda fires Annie, who has defected and become Phyllis' confidante, and the girls of troop Beverly Hills are left to their own devices. Meanwhile, the Culver City red-feathers sabotage troop Beverly Hills and Phyllis loses her walkie-talkie after running away from a snake. Although it appears the red-feathers will win, troop Beverly Hills comes in first, sprinting away from a skunk.The next day, Velda takes over as the red-feathers' leader and secretly severs the cords of a rope bridge. When Phyllis finds the collapsed bridge, she cries that the game is lost, but Hannah points out a nearby fallen tree that also crosses the ravine. Phyllis totters across the trunk so she can refasten the rope bridge. However, she slips and Hannah hurries to help her mother. Although the girl's foot gets stuck, Phyllis dislodges her and they successfully cross the gorge.Watching through binoculars, Velda realizes troop Beverly Hills has repaired the bridge and decides to lead her group on a dangerous short cut. Eager to get to the finish line, Velda trips and breaks her ankle, but the Culver City girls, including Velda's own daughter, leave their leader behind and march toward the finish line. Meanwhile, troop Beverly Hills stops to help Velda, but the cantankerous woman refuses to advise them of a shortcut, despite her injury, because she is intent on the red-feathers' victory. Using their designer backpacks to create a makeshift stretcher, the girls drag Velda to the finish line. Although Culver City arrives first, they are disqualified because they are devoid of their leader. Just then, troop Beverly Hills crosses the finish line and are awarded the championship trophy. As Velda is fired from the organization, the parents celebrate their daughters' victory. Fred kisses Phyllis, declares his love, and they get back together.The next year, Troop Beverly Hills is the designated Poster Troop, and while Velda is forced to take a job at Kmart after her actions at the Jamboree made her virtually unemployable."

On her first day on the job, NYPD officer Megan Turner, the lone officer on the scene, shoots and kills the perpetrator of a supermarket hold-up. Since no gun was found on the perpetrator's person or at the scene and none of the witnesses could corroborate Megan's story definitively that the perpetrator was indeed wielding a gun, she is suspended from active duty. She is quickly albeit temporarily reinstated to the position of homicide detective because the spent shell casing from the bullet used in a subsequent murder had her name carved on it. This murder ends up being only the first in a series. Working on the case with fellow homicide detective Nick Mann, Megan initially has no idea who in her life could be the murderer. In short order, the murderer does show himself to her. He is commodities trader Eugene Hunt who she met immediately following her suspension and who she has since dated. He also implies to her that he was in the supermarket at the time of the hold-up and that he fled the scene with the perpetrator's gun. The supermarket shooting caused a psychotic break in him which resulted in among other things his obsession with her. However, beyond his implications only to her of being the murderer, Megan has no hard evidence that would stand up in a court of law that Eugene is indeed the murderer. Megan has to convince her colleagues, especially Nick, that she is telling the truth about Eugene, while stopping him from killing again and equally as important stopping him from his continued psychological torture of her.—Huggo"

The crew of an experimental underwater nuclear base are forced to struggle for their lives when their explorations disturb a creature who threatens to destroy their base.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> A group of U.S. Navy engineers, led by Capt. Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque), are building an underwater base when they inadvertently disturb the lair of a gigantic creature. The monster attacks, and the crew, including lovers Collins (Nancy Everhard) and McBride (Greg Evigan), tries to evacuate, but the facility is badly damaged. After the exterior is breached, the increasingly desperate people become separated from one another, and the creature begins to pick them off one by one. Complete with a crew of intrepid explorers, the vessel DeepStar Six sets sail on a daunting mission to establish a top-secret nuclear Navy base on the ocean floor in this 1989 thriller starring Greg Evigan, Miguel Ferrer and Nancy Everhard.—yusufpiskin In the opening scene, Jim McBride (Greg Evigan) and Joyce Collins (Nancy Everhard) are woken when their alarm clock goes off. He mumbles something then passes it off as a dream about being underwater. She recalls it is the third time he's had the same dream. They go on to discuss Captain Laidlaw, how good his life is, with a great wife and perfect children. She then asks the man why he never married. He claims he's never been in one place long enough to get to know anyone well enough to marryLater the crew assembles in a smaller sub (DSRV2) and launch from the SEATRAK installation. The two pilots, James Richardson (Matt McCoy) and McBride discus how dreary six months underwater have become. They pick up a location transponder which belongs to a second installation Deep Star 6 (DS6) Snyder (Miguel Ferrer) contacts them to complain they are late; shift change was 20 minutes ago.
The sub moves in and quickly docks at DS6, John Hodges (Thom Bray) has fallen asleep during the brief trip and has to be woken.Overnight the on-board team had maneuvered the missile sled into position and the day crew are to begin excavation. Hodges warns the site has to sounded first to confirm there are no geological faults.Over breakfast Capt. Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque) insists that Mia Scarpelli (Nia Peeples) take the rest of the day off. She protests she has far too much work to do but the Captain orders her to stand down.The designer of DS6 Dr. John Van Gelder (Marius Weyers) contacts Collins by radio at the main base. She advised him that the findings look wrong, there is a cavern and the regulations say the missile sled can't be mounted there. Van Gelder tells Collins he wants the cavern collapsed and missiles installed by the end of the week.Scarpelli is immediately interested in the cavern; she wants to do a survey of the cavern. She is aware of strange reports of marine life in the area going back 150 years. Van Gelder, while sympathetic to her desires, refuses the request.Dr. Diane Norris (Cindy Pickett) treats Snyder for a rash on his skin, he is concerned about the rash because the mission is running well over time and budget. He wonders if Van Gelder knows what he is really doing, and why the Navy put him in charge to begin with Scarpelli goes to see the captain about Van Gelder, and the rejection of her request. Laidlaw reinforces Van Gelder's decision. He has less than a week to get the project completed.The charge to break open the cavern is deployed by a underwater tractor (SEACAT) driven by Hodges and Osborne (Ronn Carroll) The detonation breaks open the cavern but causes the seafloor to subside. The tractor has to reverse at emergency speed to avoid disaster. Collins aboard SEATRAK asks the crew of the tractor to release a small remote probe to investigate the breached cavern. The probe continues down into the depths until something attacks it and snaps its guidance cable Hodges makes a decision to go and investigate what happened to the probe. He releases the control section of the tractor which becomes a mini sub. They locate the probe and begin the process of retrieving it when Osborne reports a sonar contact closing very fast. At the last second Hodges sees the object and panics over the size and speed. He begins to report an emergency to Collins when contact is lost.Burciaga (Elya Baskin) begins trying to locate the sub using SONAR but finds no contact at all. Collins questions how the craft could have simply disappeared. Burciaga tries various telemetry feeds but fails to find the craft. Suddenly they pick up something else, moving too fast for it to be the SEACAT. Collins contact Deep Star 6 to tell them of the loss and to warn that something else is moving around down near the base. The object suddenly changes direction and hits SEATRAK. Collins reacts to the situation by declaring a mayday. Snyder has left the control room of DS6 and her plea goes unanswered. The object repeatedly attacks SEATRAK almost pushing it over an underwater cliff before breaking contact. Onboard Collins is badly hurt and Burciaga possibly dead.Snyder returns to the control room with the captain but there is no contact. Captain Laidlaw decides to go with McBride to SEATRAK and investigate whats happened. On SEATRAK, Collins begins moving around. She checks on Burciaga who is trapped by the legs and cant move. Collins tries to free him but he is pinned by some heavy equipment. She is concerned over the rising water from ruptures caused by the attack.Laidlaw picks up the same SONAR contact that Collins did. Laidlaw is stunned by the speed of the object. Laidlaw orders the sub to be brought to a stop, blow ballasts and shut down the running lights. After about a minute, the object seems to lose interest in them and continues on until contact is lost.They arrive at SEATRAK and see the damage that's been caused. Although the installation is on an angle they manage to dock cleanly. They can see the leaks flooding the control room and they detect evidence of fires on board. Working through the installation they find Collins and the trapped Burciaga in the control room. As they begin the rescue operation the installation shifts considerably threatening to collapse over the cliff at any moment. They realize Burciaga is dead and as they evacuate the installation shifts again. The movement causes a hatch to slam shut trapping Laidlaw. Laidlaw orders them to leave him. His back is broken and there is no hope of getting him out. They refuse to go, however while they manually try to reopen the hatch, Laidlaw throws a switch that floods the SEATRAC forcing Collins and McBride to leave him. Collins and McBride reach the sub and manage to un-dock just as SEATRAC lurches one more time and collapses over the side of the cliff.Back at DS6, Collins explains the events leading up to the loss of the SEATRAK. Scarpelli thinks it might be the lights on the probe and SEATRAC that provoked the aggression from the unknown creature. Word comes through that extraction from the base has been authorized and team are to begin preparations to evacuate.During Collins medical examination, the doctor catches the sound of a second heartbeat. Collins admits to McBride she is pregnant; McBride reacts very positively to the news and seems to indicate he may marry her. As the preparations for leaving DS6 progress, Van Gelder raises the question of what is to happen to the missiles. The base can't be abandoned till the weapons are secure. Snyder is sent to begin the procedure so the rest can leave.However, Snyder is queried by the system computer as to the reason the missiles are to be abandoned. He enters ""aggression"", but the computer assumes he means ""enemy aggression"" and begins detonating the missiles. Van Gelder becomes angry at Snyder for detonating the weapons. He tells everyone to hang on because a force 20 G shock wave is about to hammer the installation.The structure survives the concussion but suffers huge electronic and structural damage. Once the fires are extinguished and flooding stopped, Van Gelder informs them along with the flooding of the crew quarters; the oxygen unit has been destroyed; leaving them possibly eight hours before they run out of air and suffocate to death. The greater concern is damage to the reactor feeding power to DS6. At most they have a few hours before the reactor explodes. Finally the escape pod is unusable because of damage to the decompression system. Collins realizes they can re-route around the damage lines and get the decompression system working again. The crew set to work completing the modifications Collins recommends.To complete the rest of the repairs, Richardson dons a deep dive suit and goes outside DS6. He completes a weld on EZ6358, as he reports his success; he realizes something is out there with him. He sends a panic message about the airlock. Assuming he is trying to return, the crew trigger the retrieval system to bring him back on board. As the suit is raised from the water separating the airlock, they try to release Richardson from the diving unit. Snyder reports something else has also entered the airlock. Before Richardson can be released, a huge crab-like sea monster (seen for the first time) emerges from the water where it reaches up and bites Richardson and the suit in half from the waist down.As the remaining crew try to evacuate the room, the creature attacks and kills Scarpelli. Snyder, reaching safety, panics and closes the hatch while the others are trying to get out. Collins realizes what he's done and frees the others. McBride sees Snyder's actions as cowardice and attacks him before being pulled off by Collins. The survivors realize they have to fight the creature off and out of the diving room so they can try again to get the decompression system working.Van Gelder and Collins discuss the nature of the creature. He believes from what he saw that it is an arthropod crab of some sort, only many times larger than anything ever seen. The crew finds spear guns and CO2 cartridges and pump-action shotguns. There plan is to try and hit the creature with the cartridges and make it expand till it bursts.The reenter the flooded chamber and deploy a series of strobe lights to try and confuse the creature. As they spread out through the room they seem to be unable to locate the sea creature. Confident, McBride begins the needed repairs to the air lines. As he begins to get clear, the creature appears and the crew opens fire with shotguns. Van Gelder slips and falls backwards onto Snyder's spear causing a part of Van Gelder's chest to expand and explode. Snyder completely panics, drops his weapon and runs to safety.Now safe, the crew tries to deal with Snyder. He believes they are blaming him for all the deaths, even though everyone saw the Van Gelder death was not Snyder's fault. Dr. Norris gets him calm enough to give him a shot that further sedates him.Collins, McBride, and Norris go off to prepare the decompression pod for the evacuation. Left to his devices, Snyder has a vision of Van Gelder appear and blames him for his death. Snyder, now completely insane, races to the escape pod, bypassing the decompression system and launches the rescue pod to the surface. We follow the pod's progress to the surface as at first Snyder's nose beings to bleed then lesions form on his arms and face, these gather intensity till they begin to also flow freely. Finally, Synder's body, overloaded by the changed atmospheric pressures, explodes.In the remaining safe area of the installation the three survivors, Collins, McBride, and Norris weigh up their options. They now only have three hours before the reactor blows. McBride asks Collins to marry her. She accepts. McBride realizes if he can get through the flooded section of the DS6 he can bring the remaining mini sub around to the lock with the decompression chamber and possibly save everyone.McBride succeeds in reaching the mini sub and begins to pilot it back to the other side of the station. Collins and Norris hear a tapping sound at the locking hatch, think it is McBride and get hit by a wall of water. Finally they get the hatch closed again. Norris orders Collins into the pressure chamber, as she waits for it to open; they hear a noise in the water. Norris believes the creature is in the room with them. She slides over to a medical station and charges up a defibrillator. As the creature attacks she tries unsuccessfully to shock it. Surviving long enough for the paddles to recharge, she sticks them in the water... thus electrocuting her to death and badly injuring the creature. As Collins scrambles into the decompression chamber she finds McBride already there. They watch stunned as the creature seems to go through its death throes before slipping beneath the water.Sometime hours later, an alarm goes off indicating decompression is complete. With only minutes to go, McBride and Collins quickly evacuate to the mini-sub and launch just as the reactor explodes. They work their way to the surface fighting through a series of shock waves thrown out by the explosion. They reach the surface and deploy the life raft. Just as they climb in, the sea creature suddenly surfaces and attacks. McBride is trapped on the sub. He releases the remaining fuel and then fires a flare gun igniting a raging inferno around the sub. After a few minutes the sub explodes, presumably killing the creature at last. Collins looks on horrified thinking he's just died. On the verge of giving up she sees him surface.In the final shot, as the camera pans back, we see the couple in joyous embrace floating in the life raft on a calm empty sea.Original synopsis written by Chapman_glen@yahoo.com"

Hughie lustfully caresses Rae's figure while ripping off her shorts and underwear, and Rae moans loudly, pretending to be aroused. With both completely nude, they begin foreplay with Hughie kneading her backside as Rae slowly kisses him. Rae then says that she needs to go to the bathroom. Hughie casually lets Rae go as she slides up off of him, while seductively kissing his chest, and slips on her short black robe. In actuality, she heads up on deck to put together the shotgun. The dog shows up and begins to bark for attention. Rae whispers for him to be quiet, but by then it's too late as Hughie had already heard the dog. Suspicious, Hughie gets up from the floor to look for Rae.Knowing that she doesn't have enough time to load the gun, she quickly sees cigarettes and grabs hold of them leaving the unloaded gun behind. Hughie is relieved when she brings out the cigarettes which she says are for after they have sex. Rae then goes to kiss Hughie some more. Hughie is flattered by this and believes that she wants to continue from where they left off. To distract Hughie away from the gun though, Rae seductively leads him to her bed. In the bedroom, Rae gets naked again and sits up on her bed while Hughie stands right in front of her caressing his hand all over her body. Rae begins to quiver and close her eyes, pretending to be pleased during this. Hughie leans down to kiss her neck causing Rae to quirk her eyes and jerk her head slightly. When she opens her eyes, she stares up at his face while Hughie strokes her lips yet again and moves in to mount her.As Hughie lays on top of Rae he starts kissing her breasts. The door opens causing Rae to jerk her head in shock. It was the family dog looking to to see what was going on. She cleverly tells Hughie that she wants to put the dog up onto the deck (in hopes that she can also finish loading the gun). However, Hughie is so sexually aroused at this point that he tries to ignore her request and finally takes the matter into his own hands by telling the dog to go away. The dog listens and heads out the door leaving Rae behind with Hughie passionately kissing all over her face. Feeling that there are no other options at this point, Rae firmly wraps her arms and legs around Hughie and readies herself for sex. Hughie firmly enters her which seems to cause Rae discomfort, and she fakes an orgasm as the dog reenters the room.Back on the sinking ship, the mast falls over, covering the exit hatch and trapping John. He continues driving the boat until it no longer works, and as the room floods completely, he grabs a small tube and sticks it out of the hatch, allowing him to breathe. Suddenly, he sees fish inside the ship and realizes that there must be a hole. He finds it and breaks out of the ship. He sets the sinking ship on fire to signal for help.Meanwhile Rae and Hughie are still in the bedroom. While Hughie is getting dressed in John's clothes, Rae (back in her robe) sits on her bed. With time running out, she focuses on rescuing John by continuing to play the part of ""Hughie's lover."" She gets up and allows Hughie to play some music while they kiss and hug each other. When Hughie leaves for the bathroom, Rae fixes a drink, slips in some of her sleeping medicine, and pretends to drink it as he returns. She then offers it to Hughie, telling him to fix her another one while she dresses.Back on deck, Rae finishes loading the gun and hides it when she hears Hughie coming. Hughie is suspicious again until Rae buys time by saying that he should ready the yacht for a coming storm. When Hughie returns, he finds her with the gun and fights to get it away from her. The fight wears down Rae, who drops the gun and hides. Hughie then feels the effects of the sedative and recklessly uses up the ammunition, which allows Rae to locate John's spear gun and lock herself in the bedroom. Once Rae locks herself in her bedroom she continues to shoot the spear gun at the pounding door. When she sees blood running from the open end of a spear in the door, she assumes that Hughie got hit. However to her surprise he comes out from behind the door to strangle her. He almost succeeds were it not from the drugged drink which causes him to finally pass out. Rae discovers that the blood was actually that of her dog whom she accidentally killed with the harpoon sticking out of his neck. After tying up Hughie, Rae gets dressed in warmer clothes and steers the boat towards John.Later one, Hughie wakes up and cuts himself loose with a broken mirror piece that he shattered, but Rae knocks him out with the spear gun before he could do anything. She later releases a rescue raft from the yacht, pushes Hughie's body into it, and watches him float away. Rae later sights the now-blazing shipwreck in the distance and eventually finds John in a raft next to the signal fire he has set. Holding out her hand, she pulls him from the raft as the yacht speeds by.Soon after, the couple are once again happy. They discover the floating raft with Hughie's body missing. Trying to forget and put aside what she went through with Hughie, Rae grabs a flare gun and blows out a flare to sink the floating raft leaving John to wonder what had happened when he was stranded. Later on the next day Rae is swimming in the ocean to cleanse herself as John looks down on her. Rae climbs back on the boat and sits as John soothingly washes her hair with his hands. She closes her eyes in pleasure feeling happy to be back with John. John leaves for a moment to prepare their meal. Suddenly a pair of bloody hands (obviously Hughie's) begin washing Rae's hair, she soon discovers it is not John washing her. She begins to scream for help until Hughie strangles her. John comes back looking at the struggle and quickly grabs a flare gun. With the flare gun, he fires it into Hughie's mouth and Hughie's head flares up as he falls off of the ship. Rae and John run back to each other and stare at Hughie's body float away into the ocean."

However, Georgina plots revenge against Albert with the support of Richard and the victims of Albert.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Master director Greenaway (THE PILLOW BOOK) outdoes himself with this grisly fairy tale.

Once there, they are cleaned off by one of the restaurant staff and remain, hiding from Albert.

George attempts to introduce himself to the rival VHF network Channel 8 station but its owner, the mean and cynical R.J. Fletcher (Kevin McCarthy), chases him out angrily. On his way out of the station, he encounters janitor Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards), a mentally challenged man who has been unfairly fired by Fletcher for supposedly pitching a valuable research report, which has been on Fletcher's desk chair all the time. George offers him a job at Channel 62 as the head janitor.Seeing that Channel 62 airs mostly old reruns of classic TV series such as ""Mr. Ed"" and ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", George sees that the station can use much more talent. Though George creates new series (including the child-friendly but poorly named ""Uncle Nutzy's Clubhouse""), the workload and bad debt of the station get to him. Amid the stress, he forgets Teri's birthday, causing her to break up with him over the incident. Despondent, George turns over ""Uncle Nutzy's Clubhouse"" to Stanley so he and Bob can go out for a drink. Arriving at the bar, they find that all the patrons are excitedly watching Stanley's antics on Channel 62. Realizing they have a success on their hands, George and Bob are revived and inspired. They come up with ideas for more original series in Channel 62's lineup, all spearheaded by the newly retitled ""Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse"".Through the film, there are cutaway scenes that are comic homages to popular series of the time, through either George's imagination or series specifically for Channel 62. For example, a dream sequence includes a music video for Weird Al's parody ""Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies"" in both the audio and visual style of Dire Straits' song ""Money for Nothing"", and fake commercials for ""Plots 'R Us Mortuary Service"", ""Crazy Eddie's Used Car Emporium"" and ""Spatula City"", as well as fake commercials for Channel 62's new TV series such as ""Gandhi II"", ""Conan the Librarian"", ""Bowling for Burgers"", an exercise show called ""Stay Fit"", a game show called ""Strip Solitaire"" hosted by Noodles, ""Practical Jokes and Bloopers"" and ""Celebrity Mud Wrestling"". Kuni (Gedde Watanabe), a local and eccentric karate instructor, becomes the host of the odd game show ""Wheel of Fish"". Philo becomes host of his own talk show ""Secrets of the Universe"". George sets up a revamped talk show called ""Town Talk"" with him as a Geralo Rivera-type host seeking controversial talk subjects. Raul Hernandez (Trinidad Silva) is hired for an animal show called ""Raul's Wild Kingdom"" where he talks to (and abuses) animals that he keeps in his apartment.As Channel 62's popularity grows, Fletcher becomes furious that a UHF station is getting better ratings than his network's programming. He learns that Harvey Bilchik is the owner of the station and has just gambled away $75,000 at the horse races and has only two days to pay off the debt. Fletcher makes Harvey the offer of covering his debt to his unseen bookie, Big Louie, in return for ownership of Channel 62, which he would then only too happily shut down (legally he cannot own two television stations in the same town). George learns of the deal and calls his aunt, who forces her husband to hold off and allow George time to raise the money Harvey owes by selling investment shares in Channel 62 through a 48-hour telethon.The telethon starts off successfully led by Stanley's boundless energy, but Fletcher sends his henchmen to kidnap Stanley. Without Stanley, the telethon grinds to a halt. George then leads a group to infiltrate Channel 8 and rescue Stanley. Philo sets up a hidden camera in Fletcher's office hoping to find something to nail him on. When he sees Stanley trying to escape, he alerts George who attempts to rescue Stanley, while imaging himself as John Rambo in a long fantasy spoof of Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) with features George (as Rambo) who attempts to rescue Stanley from Fletcher's private army. Kuni and his school of karate students also step in to complete the job and beat up most of Fletcher's henchmen.George and his group return in time to successfully finish the telethon just before Harvey's debt comes due, saving the station and making it a publicly-owned company. Fletcher on the other hand finds out that the penny he mockingly gave to a beggar earlier was a rare 1955 doubled die cent worth a substantial fortune, which the beggar sold and used to purchase $2,000 worth of Channel 62 shares (and a Rolex watch, to boot). Fletcher also discovers that a slanderous conversation of his contempt for his station's viewers was secretly recorded and rebroadcast by Philo and that Channel 8 failed to file paperwork to renew its broadcast license with the FCC. The FCC revokes his license and takes the station off the air. Philo is secretly revealed to be an alien and seeing that his work for Channel 62 is complete, teleports away unnoticed to his homeworld.As the film ends, George and Teri rekindle their relationship, (in a spoof of Rhett Butler's and Scarlett O'Hara's farewell speech from the movie Gone with the Wind (1939)), while the rest of the employees and fans of Channel 62 celebrate."

Bill Smith, chief investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), has been assigned to determine whether human error is the cause of an airline crash. He and his team of investigators are very confused by the words on the cockpit voice recorder by the crew relating to the crash. But at the same time, a theoretical physicist named Dr. Arnold Mayer has a real professional curiosity about the crash, which borders on science fiction. While giving a university lecture, he speaks about time travel and the possibility of visitors from the future. Smith discovers the involvement of an organization of time travellers from a future Earth irreparably polluted who seek to rejuvenate mankind from those about to perish in the past.—Anthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com> Bill Smith, chief investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), investigates the crash of an airplane with a great number of casualties. He meets the gorgeous and singular Louise Baltimore, who is a time traveler, in the hangar where he is examining the debris of the airplane and is immediately seduced by her. They have a one night stand and on the next morning, Louise tries to convince him to stay with her, but the reluctant Bill goes to the hangar. While snooping around in the debris, Bill is attacked by Louise, who does not seem to recognize him, and her friends. Bill soon learns that Louise is a time traveler from 1000 years in the future, when the population is sterile, and replaces the passengers from airplanes that will crash by corpses with the same features. However, they have to be careful to avoid time paradoxes that may destroy their world.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A US passenger airliner in 1989 is about to be struck from above by another airliner on a landing approach. The pilot handles the plane as well as he can while the flight engineer goes back to check on the passenger cabin. He comes back in the cockpit screaming, ""They're dead! All of them! They're burned up!""Bill Smith is a National Transportation Safety Board investigator hired to determine whether the collision and subsequent crash of both aircraft was due to some mechanical fault or human error on the part of either pilot. He and his team of investigators are confused by the flight engineer's words on the cockpit voice recorder, as there is no evidence of a fire on board before the plane hit the ground. At the same time, a theoretical physicist named Dr Arnold Mayer has a professional curiosity about the crash, which borders on science fiction. While giving a lecture, he talks about time travel and the possibility of visitors from the future.Time travellers are visiting the present day and stealing passengers from doomed aircraft. In the future, because of pollution, the human population is no longer able to reproduce, so teams are sent in to the past to abduct groups of people who are about to die and keep them in stasis until they will be sent into the far future to repopulate the Earth. While many people in the future are in poor health, some are healthy enough to successfully pass for 20th Century humans, and are given the best of food and care so that they can successfully infiltrate, using reproductions of contemporary clothing.Every incursion into the past causes an accompanying ""timequake"" whose magnitude is proportional to the effects of the incursion. Each ""timequake"" causes physical damage in the time from which the incursion has been made. This is why they are abducting people who will not be able to affect the future any further and replacing them with copies of those who would have died. Thus, the flight engineer's strange comment came because all the passengers had been replaced with pre-burned duplicates in preparation for the impending crash.While on a mission to 1963, a time travel operative on board a plane is shot before it crashes, losing a stun weapon as a result. This weapon winds up in the possession of Dr Mayer, setting him on the path to working out what is happening. Twenty-five years later Smith finds a similar artefact among the wreckage of the crash portrayed at the beginning of the film.Worried that the 20th century discoveries made by Smith and Mayer might change history, Louise Baltimore travels back to 1989 to distract Bill Smith and discourage him from pursuing his investigation further. Louise gains Bill's trust and seduces him into a one-night stand, which she hopes will complete the distraction. It is later revealed that Louise becomes pregnant as a result of this encounter. As a consequence of further errors on the part of the time travel team and paradoxical events, Bill becomes even more suspicious. He soon pays a visit to Dr Mayer. Louise materializes from the future and reveals her mission to both of them in the hope that they will voluntarily keep quiet. In a mishap with the stun weapon, Mayer inadvertently kills himself.Mayer was instrumental in the development of the Gate technology that made time travel possible, so his death results in an unresolvable paradox - a force infinity timequake - which will destroy the entire civilisation of the ""present"" future. The only course of action is to send all of the people who have been collected into the distant future before the Gate is permanently destroyed. Louise goes with Bill to the future.Bill and Louise step through the Gate and disappear: they are transported to another time and place, saving their lives, and allowing them to fulfil a destiny to repopulate the Earth. As a cataclysmic explosion destroys the Gate and the blast wave engulfs him, Sherman the Robot quotes Winston Churchill: ""This is not the end. This is not the beginning of the end. It is the end of the beginning."""

The silver-voiced soprano enjoys success through his arrangements - until she realizes that he has been committing unspeakable grisly murders in her honor and will not stop until the reclusive maestro has completed his masterpiece - in blood.—Anonymous In present day New York City, opera singer Christine Daaé (Jill Schoelen) visits her friend Meg (Molly Shannon) at a music library where they find a song written by a little known composer, Erik Destler (Robert Englund), who was allegedly a psychopathic killer in London in the nineteenth century. Destler disappeared the night an opera singer he was obsessed with was found murdered. On further investigation, Christine discovers a charred copy of ""Don Juan Triumphant,"" Destler's complete opera. As she sings its opening lines, the binder begins to bleed. However, when Meg yells that the library is closing, Christine is shocked to find the score is clean.The next day, Christine auditions using Destler's score. Her performance causes even the stage hands to take notice. As she reaches the crescendo, a sandbag comes loose in the flier above the stage and hits her. As she loses consciousness, she hears Destler's voice calling her to come back to him. When she regains consciousness, Christine is on a 19th century London stage with a different ""Meg"" (Emma Rawson) leaning over her while Joseph (Terence Beesley), a stage hand, apologizes for dropping the sandbag. La Carlotta (Stephanie Lawrence), the company's prima donna Diva, lambastes the stage manager for the company's unprofessional-ism and refuses to perform. Meg informs Christine that as Carlotta's understudy, she might have to step in.Deep below the theater, a deformed Destler sews skin onto his face and uses makeup up to hide his hideous scars while staring at a photograph of Christine. He climbs to the theater catwalk where he hears Joseph telling his colleagues it was the ""Phantom"" who caused the accident that almost killed Christine. Destler follows him to the top of the rigging, stabs the man and tosses the body over the side.Later, standing outside Christine's window and hidden in the shadows, Destler orders Christine to sing the lead role in the opera. When she finishes, he declares the world will soon hear her. Meanwhile, Martin Barton (Bill Nighy), owner of the opera, visits Carlotta to present her with a new contract, but Carlotta will only sign if Christine is demoted to the chorus. After Barton leaves in a huff, Carlotta opens an armoire to discover a now-skinless Joseph. She screams so loud that she loses her voice.Outside, Barton discusses the theater's budget with his partner, Richard Dutton (Alex Hyde-White), and complains that he found a monthly debit of 300 pounds with no receipt. Richard explains this, and a reserved theater box on opening nights, are payment to the Phantom. They go inside, and are stunned when the stage manager appears on stage to announce Carlotta is being replaced by Christine. Barton is convinced Carlotta is holding out for more money. Although Richard insists Christine's voice is superior, he goes to speak to Carlotta. Upon reaching the dressing room, he discovers Inspector Hawking viewing Joseph's skinless body. When his assistant, Davies, blames it on the Phantom, Hawking observes that ghosts do not skin their victims.Upstairs, as the opera Faustus begins, Destler enters his box, careful to remain hidden in the shadows. While watching the performance, Destler recalls playing piano in a brothel. A dwarf appears and offers him the secret of music in exchange for his soul. Destler agrees and the dwarf touches his face, causing it to burn and melt. Explaining the world will love Destler only for his music, the dwarf forces a ring onto Destler's finger declaring he is wed to the devil. Destler's thoughts are interrupted when Christine takes the stage and sings. As the audience explodes into applause, Destler leaves the theater and finds a prostitute that looks like Christine.Across town, Christine sups with Richard, explaining that her dead father sent her an ""Angel"" to teach her to sing. Although she has never seen his face, her angel is why she is so gifted. A few tables away, Barton convinces Harrison (Peter Clapham), a noted critic, not to praise Christine in his review as he needs to promote Carlotta. Although Harrison thought Christine was brilliant, he agrees to give her a bad review.The next morning, Harrison enters a steam room in a Turkish bath and is confronted by Destler, who is swathed in towels to hide his face. When the critic refuses to change his opinion about Christine, Destler kills him.Distressed by Harrison's review, Christine visits her father's grave and cries over her failure. Hearing a violin, she looks up to see Destler playing in the shadows. He tells Christine he is her ""angel of music"" and if she wishes to fulfill her destiny, she must get into his carriage. Richard arrives at the cemetery, finds the gates locked and calls for Christine. Picking music over love, Christine jumps into the carriage and is driven off.Taking Christine to his rooms beneath the opera house, Destler promises to teach her the ""meaning"" of music. She finds his unfinished opera and insists he play it for her. She sings along, unaware that a rat catcher in a nearby sewer hears them. When Destler asks how she could know the words, a confused Christine can only say she sang them before. Insisting that Christine is his muse, Destler forces the ring the dwarf gave him onto her finger, declaring she is wed to the music and he is the music. When she leaves, Destler removes his wig, dentures, nose and skin from his scarred face.Meanwhile, Richard finds Hawking and reports Christine's disappearance. The inspector informs him Destler is living under the opera house, but scoffs at Richard when he is told that, according to legend, the Phantom can only be killed when his music is destroyed. Later, Christine learns of the critic's death. Fearing for Richard's safety, she sends him a note requesting he meet her at a masquerade ball that evening. She tries to remove the Phantom's ring, but finds it will not come off.At the ball, Christine confesses she loves Richard, who leaves to find a coach to take them away, unaware that Destler, dressed as Death, overhears them. Destler cuts into a dance between Barton and Carlotta. Seducing the diva, Destler takes her into another room and strangles her.Hawking arrives at the party and is informed by the rat catcher of the location of Destler's subterranean lair, just as a buffet is wheeled into the hall. A waiter opens a tureen to reveal Carlotta's severed head. As the party-goers panic, Destler drags Christine down to his chambers. Throwing her onto his bed, he reveals his true face and tells Christine she can never leave.Hearing his pursuers enter the sewers, Destler locks Christine in his chambers and goes to confront them. He finds the rat catcher and impales him on an exposed rod, then kills a policeman and Davies before returning to his chamber. He lures Richard and Hawking to him by playing the organ. When they arrive, Destler pushes Hawking down a flight of stairs, then puts a knife to Christine's throat, but Richard shoots it out of his hand. Destler leaps on Christine's lover, knocking him into candelabra, igniting his clothes. Christine pushes over more candles, setting the chamber's furnishings on fire, then recovers Richard's pistol. Destler declares that only love and music are eternal before Christine shoots him. He grabs her hand, but Hawking reappears and shoots him twice in the back. As he falls, Destler accidentally tears the ring from Christine's finger and watches in horror as she is engulfed in flames.Christine awakens, now back in the present 20th century, to find Mr. Foster, the show's producer who is Destler hidden beneath a latex mask, helping her to her feet. Foster announces he is casting Christine in the leading role for his opera. Later, Foster takes Christine home. While he changes his clothes, Christine finds a score and computer disc of ""Don Juan Truimphant."" When she turns on the music, Destler reappears and explains he has been waiting for her to be reincarnated and demands she choose between love and music. She reaches up to embrace him, then tears off his latex mask, revealing his true face, before stabbing him with a nearby knife. She rips up the sheet music and breaks the disc. With his music destroyed, Destler dies."

His investigation opens his eyes to the horrors committed by the secret police and turns him into a target. Ben du Toit (Donald Sutherland) is a schoolteacher who always has considered himself a man of caring and justice, at least on the individual level. When his gardener, Stanley's (Zakes Mokae's) son, Jonathan (Bekhithemba Mpofu), is brutally beaten up by the Police at a demonstration by black school children, he gradually begins to realize his own society is built on a pillar of injustice and exploitation.—Mattias Thuresson Caucasian Ben du Toit (Donald Sutherland) was born in South Africa, marries Susan (Janet Suzman), has a son, Johan (Rowen Elmes), and teaches to earn a living. During the 1980s, the government declares a state of emergency, arrests and tortures tens of thousands of black residents, even as young as eleven-years-old. One of them, Jonathan (Bekhithemba Mpofu), who happens to be the son of his gardener, Stanley (Zakes Mokae), is arrested and subsequently killed by the Police while allegedly trying to escape. This sudden death arouses his suspicions, he decides to probe into this matter and ensure that no one gets away with murder. Little does he realize that soon he will be labelled a ""traitor"" by people of his own race.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) South Africa, 1976. A black boy and white boy, two friends, are happily playing-soccer, then rugby--on a beautifully manicured lawn. Johan (Rowen Elmes) is an adolescent, the son of Benjamin Du Toit, an Afrikaner schoolteacher. Jonathan Ngubene (Bekhithemba Mpofu), about the same age as Johan, is the son of Du Toit's gardener, Gordon.Outside a liquor shop in Soweto, a crowd of men are drinking from large plastic pitchers. A young man in a beret leaps on to a table and reminds those in the crowd that the beer they are drinking buys the bullets that kill their children. He is shouted down by the crowd. Nearby Jonathan is playing soccer in the street. Police pull up and begin beating young men and boys with billy clubs. They shove Jonathan and other young men into a police van.Benjamin Du Toit (Donald Sutherland)--a history teacher and former rugby player--and his wife Susan (Janet Suzman), attend one of Johan's rugby matches. As Du Toit and Susan are leaving the game, they meet Gordon (Winston Ntshona). Gordon thanks Du Toit for his financial help in educating Jonathan. 'Emily and me will always thank you.'Du Toit is in his garden enjoying a family gathering. Gordon brings Jonathan to 'Mr. Ben.' In the garage Gordon shows Du Toit and Johan Jonathan's buttocks, lacerated and bloodied from a whipping. Gordon asks Mr. Ben to hire a lawyer-he doesn't want Jonathan to have a police record. Du Toit replies 'it's a minor matter, let it go' and instructs Gordon to put iodine on the wounds. Gordon replies it is not the wounds on his son's body that he is afraid of, but those in his heart. Du Toit replies, 'there's nothing to be done.' After Gordon and Jonathan leave, Johan says, 'The cuts look terrible, Pa.' Du Toit replies: 'he must have done something.'Du Toit returns to his family in the garden. His daughter Suzette (Susannah Harker) asks what happened. Jonathan received a caning. 'Bloody savages,' says Suzette's husband. 'The only language they understand is force.' 'I thought the idea was to give them their own homeland,' Suzette adds. 'Let them live with their own kind. No conflict then. Everybody's happy.'That night Jonathan pleads with his father to not go to school the following day. He doesn't want to learn Afrikaans--where will that get him? He says to his father: We know you are a wise man, people ask your advice, you should be a lawyer, but what are you?Black school children take part in a protest march. Police block the streets and order them to disperse. The children respond by singing the liberation hymn, 'Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika', 'Lord, Bless Africa.' The police reply with warnings and threats of 'action.' The children continue singing. The police teargas the protesters. Some children hurl smoking canisters back at the police. Police open with live ammunition, shooting several students in the chest. Children flee. Police give chase, firing at the running children, shooting one in the back, then another, and another. Jonathan, charging through backyards and alleyways, stops to help a young girl crying over the body of her dead sister.
Gordon searches for Jonathan. A girl who was at the march tells him that the police took Jonathan away. At Gordon's home, Stanley (Zakes Mokae), Gordon's friend, enters. He's been driving children to the hospital all day-'one even died in the car.' Stanley, Gordon, and Gordon's wife Emily (Thoko Ntshinga), continue searching for Jonathan-first at the police station then at the morgue, where children's bodies are laid out, uncovered, on the floor, and on storage racks.Gordon tells Du Toit that Jonathan has been arrested and has disappeared. Du Toit vows to find out what he can about Jonathan's disappearance. He learns from a lawyer, Ian McKenzie, Jonathan had died-officially, 'in the rioting.' He does not know where the body was buried. Gordon vows to find out.In an alleyway near the police detention center, Gordon shows passersby a picture of Jonathan. Has anyone seen his son? One man says he did. That night Gordon brings a black lawyer and activist, Julius (John Kani), to his home to interview the witness. There's a knock on the door. A young boy enters, both arms bandaged from the wrist to above the elbows. He had been questioned and heard Jonathan's screams in the adjoining room. Jonathan was taken to the hospital and never seen again. Julius transcribes the testimonies.Gordon and his family are asleep. The police break down their front door and confiscate the notes the lawyer had taken. One of the black men whom Gordon had questioned about Jonathan's disappearance earlier, handcuffs Gordon and takes him away.Emily visits Du Toit at his school. Gordon has been arrested. Du Toit visits the police and speaks with Col. Viljoen (Gerard Thoolen). Also present is Captain Stolz (Jürgen Prochnow) who asks Du Toit for an autograph for his son, a soccer player. Du Toit obliges, and Stolz leaves. The colonel questions Du Toit about Gordon. Du Toit vouches for Gordon's character. The colonel 'assures' Du Toit that if Gordon is innocent, he will be released soon. The two men shake hands. Du Toit asks for a final favor--for Emily to bring a clean set of clothes for her husband. The colonel agrees.Gordon is being tortured. His face is beaten and bloodied. Captain Stolz demands to know who told Gordon to collect the statements regarding Jonathan's disappearance. Gordon responds: 'I want my son's body.' The torture continues.Stanley and Emily visit the Du Toit's home. Emily holds three of Gordon's teeth in the palm of her hand--they were in the pocket of Gordon's dirty clothes. Du Toit calls his lawyer, Ian McKenzie, who agrees to look into what happened to Gordon. Du Toit finishes the call. 'We must not give up hope, Emily.' 'Hope is a white word,' Stanley replies.Gordon continues to be tortured-he is hanging by from a rack by his ankles and his wrists 'Are you ready to fly?' Stolz asks. A black messenger stumbles into the interrogation room. Stolz orders him to never enter the interrogation room without knocking: 'Yes, captain. Yes, captain.'Stanley is at the Du Toit home with news from Emily: Gordon is dead. The authorities said he committed suicide. Du Toit is determined to see Gordon's body. Stanley tells him to stay out of it, but Du Toit threatens to drive himself to Soweto. Stanley relents and drives to the township with Du Toit hidden in the back seat. At the funeral home, Gordon lies in his casket-eyes swollen shut. His shirt is opened; scars are revealed. A newspaper reporter, Melanie Bruwer (Susan Sarandon), arrives at the funeral home and is acknowledged by Stanley. She asks to speak with Du Toit.Stanley tells Du Toit that Emily wants an inquest into Gordon's death. Du Toit visits McKenzie (Marlon Brando): he wants justice for Gordon Ngubene. McKenzie responds: 'Justice and the law...I suppose they can be described as distant cousins, and here in South Africa, they are simply not on speaking terms at all.' As far as the Ngubene case is concerned, he advises Du Toit to 'just give it up.' When Du Toit promises to find another lawyer, McKenzie agrees to take the case.The inquest into Gordon Ngubene's death. The courtroom is segregated by race: blacks on one side, whites on the other. McKenzie presents Gordon's teeth to the doctor who extracted them, Dr. Herzog (Paul Brooke). McKenzie questions the doctor, who testifies that he had learned from Captain Stoltz that Gordon Ngubene complained of a toothache. No, there was nothing 'noteworthy' about Gordon's appearance...he could not recall if he had used an anesthetic when he extracted the teeth...he does not recall who ordered the teeth pulled...he does recall, however, what day it is...to the 'relief' of McKenzie, who was afraid he had lost complete control of his 'faculties.' Stolz takes the stand. He testifies that Gordon Ngubene was arrested for being in possession of 'incriminating' documents. Ngubene was found hanging by a rope, tied to the window bars. A post-mortem was conducted by a police doctor. McKenzie reminds him a post-mortem was also conducted for the Ngubene family--by a doctor who had since been 'detained': Dr. Hassiem. McKenzie can present a graphologist who will testify that Dr. Hassiem's signature was forged on the official police autopsy report. The defense lawyer claims he can present several graphologists who will testify that it was not. He calls his final witness and reads his statement, which claims Gordon was in good health prior to his death. The court waits for the witness-a young man supposedly detained with Gordon--for confirmation. 'No! I signed because Captain Stolz forced me to!' He raises his shirt and reveals his back crisscrossed with lacerations. 'This is what he did to me!' McKenzie recalls Stolz to the stand and shows him photographs of Ngubene's beaten body. How does Stolz account for the lacerations across his front and back? He must have hit the bars when he tried to jump out the window, Stolz replies. 'He behaved like a wild animal.' McKenzie submits more photographs-photographs showing 'his jaw, broken; his nose, broken; his cheekbone, crushed; his eye hanging out of its socket and dangling on the crushed cheekbone; and marks and evidence of excessive burns on his genitals'-and all that while this man was trying to get out of a window?'The black members of the audience erupt in rage-yelling, screaming--and are removed from the courtroom. The magistrate responds: 'Now, Mr. McKenzie. What are you trying to prove with this idiotic recitation?' 'What I am...trying to prove with this 'idiotic' recitation, sir, is the fact that it was not Gordon Ngubene, but Captain Stolz, who behaved like a 'wild animal'.'The Ngubene's case is dismissed.The crowd leaves the courthouse. The white man, Benjamin Du Toit, fights through the crowd to reach the black woman, Emily Ngubene, and embraces her. Cameras are flashing. The crowd spills into the streets. The black Africans yell 'Justice! Justice! Justice!' The police respond with billy clubs. Du Toit is caught in the pandemonium and escapes with the reporter, Melanie Bruwer. At Melanie's home, Du Toit comes to terms with the reality of black life in South Africa. 'I've been too naive for too long.' Melanie offers him a glass of brandy: 'Welcome to South Africa, Ben Du Toit.'A picture of Du Tout embracing Emily Ngubene appears on the front page of a local newspaper. Suzette is enraged . 'My God, Pa. How could you let it go this far? You and a kaffir woman---you look like lovers.'Colleagues at the school shun Du Toit. His wife Susan becomes distant. Du Toit informs her that 'we'-'Emily and me'--are going to file a civil suit against the police. Susan asks, 'for what?' Let it go. This is not your fight. She'd heard what the police did...'I'm not saying it was right. But don't you think the blacks wouldn't do the same to us, and worse, if they had half a chance? ...We have to survive, and you must choose your own people.'Du Toit, Emily, Stanley and a black minister organize the suit against the police. They plan to search for witnesses who saw Gordon and Jonathan arrested or in custody, and to collect their signed statements, affidavits.Stanley hands Du Toit the first affidavit. Du Toit hides it in a secret compartment in a home-made lock-box in his garage. Julius, the activist and lawyer, and Stanley collect more affidavits-from the girl Jonathan helped the day he was arrested; from a nurse at the hospital where Jonathan was taken; the undertaker at the funeral home. The messenger who stumbled into the interrogation room tells Stanley and Du Toit that he saw Gordon being tortured, but he won't sign an affidavit-it would be suicide. That night Captain Stolz shoots him point blank in the chest in the doorway of his house.Stolz and his men search Du Toit's home, remove several documents, and place him under surveillance. The police question Johan at school; afterwards, Johan is attacked by schoolmates. Du Toit demands the colonel and captain leave his family alone.Du Toit comforts Johan. Johan says he knows what the police did to Gordon and Jonathan was wrong. 'Don't stop, Pa. Please, I don't want you to give up.'Emily and her children are given four weeks to leave their home.Du Toit visits the doctor who conducted the autopsy for the Ngubene family, Dr. Hassiem (Charles Pillai), who is recently released from detention. Dr. Hassiem gives him the genuine report. He can also provide the name of the young man who was arrested with Jonathan: Wellington, who saw everything. Wellington is in Zambia. Du Toit passes the information on to Melanie. 'With Wellington's statement, we can nail Stolz to the wall.' Melanie volunteers to go to Zambia.It's Christmas time. Du Toit is called to the headmaster's office and is fired. Johan is expelled. 'We don't need traitors here,' says the headmaster. Du Toit, on his way out the door, turns and slaps him in the face.It's a dour Christmas party at the Du Toit's household. As they are opening their Christmas presents, a drunken Stanley barges in. He and Du Toit struggle and crash to the floor. Stanley is in tears: 'Emily has been killed.' He tells Du Toit and Johan Emily was beaten by the police as she tried to prevent her children from being taken away. Susan re-enters the room. 'What a pretty picture: a drunken kaffir and an Afrikaner traitor. You deserve each other.' She moves out of the house.Du Toit and Johan are in the garage. Du Toit shows Johan his lock-box and the hidden compartment where the affidavits are hidden. From a distance, Suzette sees the hiding place.Captain Stolz returns the papers the police seized when they searched Du Toit's house. Du Toit signs for them. Stolz warns: 'There's a line you should not cross. I'd like to convince you of this.' That night Du Toit and Johan are sitting in the living room watching television. Three gunshots shatter the quiet of the evening. Du Toit throws Johan to the floor and protects him with his body.Du Toit visits Melanie. Her newspaper must publish the affidavits; there is no time for a lawsuit. All his 'references have switched.' Nothing is the same anymore.A bomb rips apart the garage where the lock-box is hidden. Thunderstruck, Du Toit examines the remains. The lock-box is destroyed. Johan runs into the house and returns with the affidavits. Suzette saw their hiding place, so he moved the documents.On her way back from Zambia, Melanie is taken into custody and deported from South Africa--but she has already passed along Wellington's affidavit to Stanley through an intermediary.Stanley brings Wellington's statement to Du Toit. They make plans to deliver all the affidavits to the newspaper that night. 'Not you, man,' Stanley says, 'you know Stolz will be on your ass every minute.' Du Toit is aware of that. He'll be the decoy.Du Toit calls Suzette: there was a break-in at the garage. They were looking for 'some things' I had hidden there, but they didn't find them. 'Why don't I look after them,' Suzette says.Du Toit meets Suzette at a restaurant that evening and slips her a large envelope. As Suzette leaves, a tear rolls down Du Toit's cheek. It's raining. Suzette hands Stolz the envelope, who opens it in his car. There is the receipt Du Toit signed when Stolz returned his documents. On the back is printed: 'No one can be free until all are free. Benjamin Du Toit.'At the same time, Johan bicycles in the driving night rain to the newspaper editor and delivers the real affidavits.Benjamin Du Toit leaves the restaurant. As he crosses the street Stolz's car appears. The car accelerates. Du Toit is illuminated in the glare of the headlights and is hit at full speed. He's launched over the roof and on to the road. Stolz accelerates backwards and bounces over the body, changes gears, and runs over him a third time, killing him.A new day. Stolz leaves his home and loads a sports bag into the trunk of his car. He turns. Across the street, behind the wheel of his car, Stanley is waiting. Their eyes lock. Images of Stolz's victims flash across the screen: Jonathan. Gordon. Emily. Du Toit. Stanley levels his revolver and fires a single round into Stolz's chest--and drives away.The newspaper publishes the affidavits."

In the late 1960s, two hippies are forced to leave their friends as they are wanted by the FBI, who see them as criminals. They hide in the jungle for 20 years, secluded from the outside war. In the late 1980s, they find out that a secret war is about to start in the US, and decided to return to New York to tell someone about it. What they find when they return is that all of their fellow hippies have become rich yuppies, like everyone else, and that no one wants to save the world anymore -- they just want to buy it.—Anonymous In 1969 New York City, anti-Vietnam protesters Fred Wouk (Eric Roberts) and Jesús Monteya (Cheech Marion) prepare for an upcoming rally with their friends, Ronnie Sunshine (Louise Fletcher), Sammy Margolin (Robert Carrradine), and Petra Black (Julie Hagerty. Elsewhere, FBI Agent Joe Brubaker (Cliff De Young) instructs a team of undercover officers to infiltrate the protesters and arrest Fred and Jesús for draft dodging.At Ronnie's boarding house, Fred kisses his girlfriend, Petra. She expresses her desire for children, but Fred does not want to be tied down. When Agent Brubaker arrives to arrest Fred and Jesús, Ronnie denies they are there. Fred and Jesús soon flee, leaving their friends behind.Twenty years later, in a Central American country called Managuador, Fred has established himself as the leader of a jungle commune dubbed ""Filmore South,"" inhabited by 30 other ""hippies."" They spend their days smoking marijuana and talking about farming, but accomplish nothing. Fred warns a resident named Merlin that if they return to civilization, they will get caught up in commercialism. One day, chaos erupts when militants chase a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative through the jungle, shooting at the man. Fred finds the injured agent, clutching top-secret documents. Before dying, he instructs Fred not to let the papers fall into enemy hands. Fred learns from the secret reports that the U.S. is planning to invade communist Managuador. Fearing another Vietnam, Fred decides that he and Jesús must return home and leak the information to the press, so that citizens will protest and prevent another war. They bid farewell to the commune, and return to New York City.Once back in New York, Fred and Jesús are in awe of the changes that have occurred. They return to Ronnie's boarding house to find that she has turned it into a ""Nouveau Woodstock"" dinner theater. Ronnie is stunned to see her old friends, and explains that she hates what has become of the boarding house. Elsewhere, Petra Black has become a wealthy businesswoman, but complains to her therapist about the emptiness she feels. When Fred and Jesús arrive at her door, she does not recognize them. After realizing that the hippies are her old friends, she asks them to leave, but they ignore her request and convince her to smoke marijuana with them. Meanwhile, Agent Bubaker learns the men have returned to New York City with the top-secret papers.Petra finally relaxes with her friends, and Fred suggests they go dancing at a nightclub, where Fred has a profound effect on Petra's uptight friends. Returning to Petra's apartment later that night, Fred expresses his unwavering desire for her, and they make love. In the morning, Fred telephones his friend, Sammy Margolin, and asks to meet. However, Agent Brubaker arrives, and forces his way inside Petra's home. Brubaker holds Petra at gunpoint, and demands Fred to give him the top-secret documents. Jesús emerges with a gun, and the men have a standoff. After experiencing Wild West hallucinations, Jesús shoots Brubaker in the hand.The trio flees, and seeks refuge at Sammy's home, where Sammy and his wife, June (Cindy Williams), are in the midst of an interview with board members, April and Lloyd Stool (Andrea Martin and Buck Henry), to buy a co-op apartment. The crazy hippies embarrass June, and she worries that they will lose their new apartment. However, the Stools, as well as Sammy and June's teenage son, are amused by Sammy's colorful friends. Lloyd Stool mentions a friend who works for the press, and Fred tells him about the secret documents, hoping to meet the reporter. However, Fred soon realizes that Lloyd Stool is a self-interested conservative. He insults Lloyd, and chastises Sammy for changing so much. The friends leave, and go to Ronnie's boarding house to hide out for the night.A little later, Sammy arrives to apologize to Fred, Jesús and Petra, and the old friends smoke marijuana and remember their hippie days. When Brubaker arrives, they sneak out the back door and go to a local park to plan their next move. Fred suggests they take over the nearby New York University (NYU) campus and initiate a ""sit-in."" Under cover of darkness, they enter a campus building and discuss their mission. Fred is stunned when Sammy and Petra catch him up on world events of the past twenty years. He wonders why his friends are not protesting the many atrocities that have occurred. However, Sammy and Petra turn the tables on Fred, and ask what he has been doing for the past twenty years in the jungle. Fred admits that his planned Utopian society was never realized, and admits that he ran away from life. Jesús asserts that they now have a second chance to make things right.When the students arrive for their morning classes, they find the doors barred, and see a sign declaring, ""Stop the War in Central America."" From a window several stories up, Fred makes a speech revealing U.S. plans to start another war, and appeals to the onlookers to protect the earth from escalating environmental problems. News cameras come to film the event, and Brubaker arrives, demanding the return of the incriminating documents. When he holds Fred at gunpoint, his friends sing patriotic songs and convince Brubaker to lower his gun. Elsewhere, Sammy's son takes the documents to the New York Times, which publishes them.In time, however, the American people support the war in Central America, and Fred is devastated. Petra, Sammy, and Ronnie urge Fred to stay and protest the war, but he refuses. Fred bids farewell to his friends, and Jesús insists on joining him, although Fred he has no idea where he is going. Feeling lost, Fred sits on the sidewalk and begins to cry. A group of NYU students who heard Fred's speech approach him, asking for his help to organize a protest against the toxic waste being dumped into a local river. Fred is moved by their request. Seeing him talking with the students, Petra smiles at him.Fred finally sees that despite the fact that the ""establishment"" (U.S. government) always wins in the end, as long as there are liberal and young students out there that speak out, there will always be hope for the world. The final shot shows Jesús having another acid flashback where he talks with the magical talking fish emerging from a manhole sewer that he encountered earlier while fishing at a river at the commune in Central America."

It's a race where fair play, red lights, stop signs, police roadblocks and traffic rules in general have no validity. An illegal race that takes place over the United States and nothing will stop this bunch of racers except for the occasional cop or a damsel in distress. Jackie Chan's car is not in this one, but many new cars make up for that. Who will win? Who will crash? Who will not even finish? Sit down and buckle up for the ride of your life.—Billy Plessel <billp5@juno.com> An assortment of greedy and eccentric people are forced to participate in the annual and illegal cross-country car race, the Cannonball Run. From Washington, D.C. to Santa Monica, they race in order to claim a cash-prize money for the winner and runners-up. Oafish Charlie is forced to drive a BMW with bubble-brained starlet Tiffany. Alec is an English deadbeat who asks Mafia hitman Vic, hired to kill him for outstanding bad loans, to travel with him in a Jaguar XJ-12. Alec hopes to use the prize money to get out of his debits. M.I.T. graduates and best friends Lea and Margaret participate in the race, driving a Ferrari Daytona Spyder, hoping to meet some good looking guys along the way.

When they arrive, they find a naked Gus in a hot tub. They are all surprised when the Fuzz Buster goes off, indicating police nearby. In the banquet hall, Police Chief Spiro T. Edsel (Peter Boyle) leads dozens of machine-gun-toting cops who cart off all the drivers.

Nelson explains to his brother that they are going to cheat by flying to Las Vegas, Nevada, to do some gambling, then fly to Los Angeles where they will pick up an identical Bentley and drive it a few miles to Santa Monica for the win.Back in Washington, D.C., Chief Edsel learns the Cannonball Run is underway, and calls for a conference of every state police commissioner in the lower 48 states.As the race proceeds, Alec eliminates some of competition by telephoning police along the way, claiming other racers' cars are stolen or the drivers had committed hit and runs. When Alec comes to a ferry crossing, the boat is leaving the wharf. Vic DeRubis pushes him out of the driver's seat and jumps the car off the pier, over the ferry, and on to the other side of the river. When the boat docks, Alec attempts to bribe the pilot not to ferry the other racers. When the pilot refuses, Vic knocks him unconscious.Meanwhile, Charlie is taking another route, when Tiffany has a panic attack. He teaches her a breathing technique that causes her to fall asleep. Charlie is distracted by her low-cut top and accidentally cuts off a tractor-trailer truck which the unseen driver gives chase (a reference to the 1971 film 'Duel'). As Charlie tries to get away from the truck, his cigarette ash falls between Tiffany's legs, setting the seat on fire.

The crew overpowers the hijacker, but the aircraft rolls off the runway onto Interstate 80 where the plane loses its wings as it goes under an overpass. Refusing to lose the race, Randolph Van Sloan bribes the captain to taxi the plane to Los Angeles.Alec and Vic are the first to make it to Bakersfield and discover the road is blocked by hundreds of state troopers. Vic attempts to run the barricades, but Alec pulls out the keys and they coast into the arms of police and are placed in a cruiser. As Chief Edsel pontificates to television cameras, the jet smashes through the barricade at full throttle, opening a hole for the other racers. Vic and Alec break off their handcuffs and Alec jumps into the driver's seat of the police cruiser. Deciding to hide in plain sight, Alec turns on his sirens and joins the other police cars chasing the racers. Finding himself without a car, Edsel jumps into the Jaguar and races after them. They drive to Los Angeles, cutting off other drivers, running red lights, and jumping meridians.As they race through Hollywood, Tiffany tells Charlie she is afraid of Leo. Charlie tells her she has Leo ""all wrong,"" then suddenly realizes they have lost their brakes. They hurtle down a hill, but Charlie turns onto a side road and rolls to a stop. Olympic sprinter Carl Lewis runs up complaining that he has been chasing Charlie for miles and hands Charlie his time card.At the Santa Monica pier, Alec is chased by Chief Edsel in the Jaguar. He explains to Vic that it does not matter who is driving the Jaguar, if it crosses the finish line before the other racers, it wins. Alec uses the sirens to clear a path, but Chief Edsel loses control and the Jaguar smashes through a viewing stand into several police cruisers. When Edsel emerges holding the time card, a race official punches it and declares the Jaguar the winner. Michael Spinks arrives, asks who is driving the Jaguar, and then punches Chief Edsel in the face.As the other racers celebrate finishing the race, Charlie and Tiffany take a walk on the beach.

Blind Fury,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096945/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A blind Vietnam vet, trained as a swordfighter, comes to America and helps to rescue the son of a fellow soldier. Nick Parker (Rutger Hauer) is a Vietnam vet who was blinded during the war. He was found by one of the local tribes who taught him to enhance his remaining senses and to expertly wield a sword. On his return to the United States, he goes to visit an old Army buddy, Frank Devereaux (Terrance O'Quinn), but discovers that he and his wife, Lynn (Meg Foster) are divorced, and Frank no longer lives there. What they don't know is that Devereaux was playing in a crooked casino in Reno, Nevada, and accumulated a large debt. Casino boss MacCready (Noble Willingham) is willing to forgive his debt if he does something for him: Devereaux is a chemist, and they want him to make designer drugs. In order to make sure he does it, they try to kidnap his son, Billy (Brandon Call). But Nick is there, and Nick saves the boy. Thus begins a road trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, to protect the boy and save his friend with the boss' henchmen in pursuit.—<rcs0411@yahoo.com> A totally blind vietnam vet comes back to help this boy and mother who are being chased by criminals. The blind man is a swords man, who fights against people with guns, swords, drives a car, and does it all better than anyone with 20/20 vision. No matter what the challenge, the blind man can take away guns, dodge bullets, and fight with a sword or stick equally well. A sighted person would have great trouble duplicating everything this blind guy does. Yes, he may have been a Shaolin Monk back in Vietnam, or trained with them, but blind is still blind. As the movie progresses the absurdity of the whole thing starts to wear a little thin on the viewer, and there just is no way to suspend belief and tell yourself that this could ever happen in real life. And since the film is an action film and not science fiction, there should be some attachment to reality. This is surely the dumbest movie ever made, bar none, and the only reason to watch it at all is if you are a Brandon Call fan."

A spoof of Norse mythology. Erik (Tim Robbins), a young Viking, has no taste for rape and pillage, and suffers guilt over the death of Helga (Samantha Bond), an innocent woman killed during an attack on a village by Erik and other Vikings.The wise woman Freya (Eartha Kitt) teaches Erik that Fenrir the wolf has swallowed the sun, plunging the world into the grip of the age of Ragnarök. Erik resolves to travel to Asgard to petition the gods to end Ragnarök. To do so he must seek the ""Horn Resounding"" in the land of Hy-Brasil. The first note blown upon the Horn will take Erik and his crew to Asgard, the second awakens the gods, and the third brings the crew home.Swordmakers Keitel Blacksmith (Gary Cady) and his assistant Loki (Antony Sher) are opposed to Erik's plan, because peace would end the demand for weapons. Keitel joins Erik's crew planning to sabotage Erik's plans. Halfdan the Black (John Cleese) joins them, afraid that peace will mean the end of his reign, and sets sail in pursuit.Arriving at Hy-Brasil, Erik and crew are astonished to find it a sunlit land whose people are friendly (if musically untalented). Erik falls in love with Princess Aud (Imogen Stubbs), daughter of King Arnulf (Terry Jones).Aud warns the Vikings that should blood ever be shed upon Hy-Brasil, the entire island would sink beneath the waves. Erik and his crew defend Hy-Brasil against Halfdan's ship. In gratitude for Erik's having saved Hy-Brasil, King Arnulf presents him with the Horn Resounding. Loki steals the Horn's mouthpiece to prevent it from being sounded, and persuades Keitel to throw it in the sea. Snorri, one of Erik's men, catches them in the act, and Loki kills him.

Odin persuades Fenrir to spit out the sun, but tells Erik that the end of Ragnarök will not bring peace to the world. Odin then informs Erik that he and his crew cannot return home. Nor may they remain in Valhalla, since they were not slain in battle; instead they are to be cast into the fiery Pit of Hel. Some of the Vikings who were killed in the sea-battle with Halfdan attempt to save them, but even as they are drawn into the Pit, they hear the Horn Resounding's third note, which flings them clear.Erik's crew, including the formerly dead men, immediately find themselves back in their home village. They are dismayed to find that Halfdan and his soldiers have arrived before them and are holding the villagers captive.

Tommy tosses Alex a roll of tape as Frank Couzo (James Earl Jones), the U.S. head coach watches. As the competition gets under way, Travis approaches Virgil Keller (John Dye), another competitor, and warns him to watch his face. Another athlete, Sonny Grasso (David Agresta), theorizes that Travis' bad attitude comes from his mother never having breast fed him.

As he walks away, coach Frank Couzo tells Don Peterson (Tom Everett), his assistant, that Travis is ""a fighter.""After multiple matches, Couzo gives Mr. Jennings (John P.

She explains that Koreans have been trained since birth in meditation and focus and that without her help the U. S. can never defeat them.The men are put through a brutal training regimen which includes yoga and meditation classes with Catherine.

He tells Alex he cannot fight Dae Han because he is afraid he will kill the man, but Alex explains that he is only destroying himself by holding in his anger. Tommy shrugs him off and rides away on his motorcycle.Catherine breaks into Couzo's office to read Tommy's file, then accuses the coach of only caring about winning. Couzo explains that he was David's coach, and the boy died because he did not prepare him for the fight. His only goal in life is to make sure that never happens again. Later, Travis, Virgil, and Sonny tell Couzo they need both Alex and Tommy to win. Couzo merely tells them to be on the flight in the morning, then asks Alex to come back.Meanwhile, Tommy stops for gas and sees a boy drop his ice cream cone.

Virgil also loses, giving the Koreans an eleven point lead. Travis takes the floor and receives a crushing blow to the head. Despite being blinded by his own blood, he battles on and ties the match.To break the tie, the athletes each approach a pile of cement blocks. Travis smashes six, but his opponent breaks nine. Tommy takes Alex aside and tells him it is up to them to bring in the victory. Alex leaps ahead in his match, but his opponent lands a lucky blow and taunts him. Alex leaps on him and both teams rush the mats, but are constrained by their coaches and security personnel.In the third round, the Korean dislocates Alex's shoulder with a flying kick.

With one hand tied to his side, Alex drop kicks the Korean out of the ring, winning the match.With the score 29 for South Korea and 22 for the U.S.A., Tommy faces Dae Han Park.

Couzo takes Tommy in his arms and tells him he really won the match.Later, as the Koreans receive their gold medals, a bloody Dae Han hobbles over to Tommy. He tells him that ""to save a life with defeat is to earn victory and honor,"" then places his medal around Tommy's neck. Apologizing for David's death, Dae Han offers himself as Tommy's brother. Alex's opponent walks over and presents him with his medal, also. The rest of the Korean team does likewise, and the crowd explodes into applause."

Babar: The Movie,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096869/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In his spectacular film debut, young Babar, King of the Elephants, must save his homeland from certain destruction by Rataxes and his band of invading rhinos. The film begins in the present day, during a cheerful and festive parade in the fictional city of Celesteville. All the citizens throw peanuts, sing, dress up and wave to the parade floats, including one of a large, menacing-looking elephant with a horn for a nose. The crowd is excited to see King Babar and his family (Queen Celeste, Babar's children). Later that night, Babar agrees to tell his children the story behind the festivities and where the parade's name came from.Going back in time to when Babar was younger and his kingdom was still developing, Babar is weighed down by the formalities and diplomacy associated with being king. When doing something as basic as trying to choose a good name for a parade to celebrate Celesteville, Babar's overzealous advisors (elderly advisor Cornelius, and Pompadour, the high-strung minister of protocol), instead sing to him to encourage the process of bureaucracy, something which they both adore. Troubadour, their tiny mute elephant clerk, assists with an accompanying slideshow. Babar finds the whole thing unbearably slow and boring, but this is interrupted by a young Celeste, who runs in terrified to tell Babar that her village and all her friends and family are in danger of being attacked by Rataxes, a terrifying rhinoceros, and his many men. When Cornelius and Pompadour flat-out refuse to believe her, finding the whole idea of it silly, Celeste runs out of the palace crying. Babar chases after her and promises that he will do something to help. He orders Cornelius and Pompadour to implement an elephant army to protect the village, but they inform him that to do so properly would take at least three days.Knowing that Cornelius and Pompadour will be reluctant to let him do anything, Babar decides to use Celeste's brother, Arthur, as a stand-in for himself so his advisors won't worry about him while he's away helping Celeste. Babar climbs out the window and escapes. Arthur dresses up as Babar and assumes the role, but quickly finds it nerve-wracking when Cornelius comes in unannounced and stands next to him, believing him to be Babar. Babar himself, meanwhile, tricks the guards into opening the palace doors and he runs away into the jungle.Upon arriving at Celeste's village, he is horrified to discover that she was telling the truth - rhinos are lighting fire to houses and chaining up all the elephants, including Celeste's own mother. Babar tries to intervene, head-butting numerous rhinos aside, but he is knocked unconscious by a larger rhino and Celeste is thrown down a water well. When Babar wakes up the next day, he rescues Celeste from the well and the pair discover that Celeste's grandfather has survived the attack, and protected many of the village children in the process. Babar instructs them to go seek refuge at the palace, and then he and Celeste set off to rescue her mother, and the other elephants, from Rataxes' wrath. The elephants have been stripped of their clothing, tied up and used as slave labor for the building of a new rhino kingdom.Along the way, Babar and Celeste meet a zany and playful monkey named Zephir, who gives them the location of the rhinos' base after singing a fun song with his new friends. They also meet a surprisingly helpful crocodile, named Croc, who lives within the jungle. Babar and Celeste finally arrive at the rhino's base, only to come face to face with Rataxes himself, who plans to invade Babar's kingdom by twilight. Babar worries what will become of his advisors and his kingdom if Elephantland is invaded, but he and Celeste are put in jail before they can do anything about it. Luckily they are able to escape with the help of Zephir, and they hurry back to Elephantland to save it.Heading into the rhinos' tents, they disguise themselves as one of the warriors, asking for ""special detail"" of their plans for attack, but to no avail. They get away from Rataxes quickly, launching from a catapult and landing in a fountain, much to the surprise of Cornelius, Pompadour and Troubadour, who don't recognize him (they still think Arthur in disguise is the real Babar). Pompadour berates Babar and Celeste for attempting to swim in a public fountain, but then Arthur reveals himself to the advisors and Babar is reintroduced. Cornelius and Pompadour are happy to see him back, but they are horrified when the rhinos approach the kingdom, threatening to kill them if they refuse to surrender.To buy time, Babar leads the two advisors along with him outside the palace grounds, suggesting that they come up with an answer for the impatient Rataxes about whether or not the kingdom will surrender. Babar hopes to distract Rataxes; Cornelius and Pompadour nervously attempt to get the rhino leader on-board with diplomatic protocols by singing to him about committees, which Babar expected from them. This works for a few minutes but eventually only angers Rataxes further, sending both advisors running in terror back inside the palace gates as Rataxes continues to heighten his threats. Babar comes up with a resourceful and innovative plan, and the elephant army takes some action into their hands. Together the elephants use the palace musical horn as a fake trunk for a large elephant which they have sewn. This giant elephant float appears real to the rhino soldiers, who flee in terror, only to bump into Croc and his gang of other crocodiles, who proceed to chase the rhinos and bite their behinds. Rataxes initially believes the float is a diversion to distract him from invading the palace, but when he accidentally lands on the float between its crazed-looking painted eyes, he runs away screaming into the distance.At sunrise, Babar's friends congratulate him on saving the day and his town, but Pompadour rushes in with worry, exclaiming that the committee he and Cornelius had set up was unable to decide on a name for the parade. Cornelius orders his colleague to calm down, pointing out that Babar as the king is responsible enough to choose a good name, considering he saved the palace. The elephants are surprised to learn that their very first Victory Parade will be held during the afternoon. It has gone by that name ever since, the older Babar recalls.As Babar finishes his tale, he finds that his children have all gone to sleep. Right after he closes the door, they re-enact scenes from the story, until their father tells them to get back to bed. This film later became the basis for the 1990's Nelvana-Ellipse television series Babar, which continued the story with the same characters."

Instead of going down to see him, Kiki goes straight to her room.The next day, Osono finds Kiki has gotten sick from flying in the rain.

During the session, Kiki confides into Ursula that magic used to come easily, but is wondering why it has stopped. Ursula tells Kiki that her magic sounds like her with art. Sometimes you just need to step back and take a little break, and it will most likely come back.At the end of her time away, Kiki calls Osono, who tells her the old woman she made a delivery for would like to see her again.Upon returning to the seaside town, Kiki stops by the woman's residence, who has fashioned a cake for Kiki as an added thank you for her services.

Santa Sangre,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098253/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A former circus artist escapes from a mental hospital to rejoin his armless mother--the leader of a strange religious cult--and is forced to enact brutal murders in her name as he becomes ""her arms"". A young man--starving, nearly catatonic and barely responsive--is confined in a sanitarium. He is taken on a field trip along with other residents to the city's red-light district. There, he encounters by chance a woman from his past, triggering a series of flashbacks. We see that he was traumatized as a child, when he and his family were circus performers, and when he witnessed a murder/suicide: his father, an American expatriate living in Mexico under suspicious circumstances, cuts off the arms of his beloved mother, a possessive wife and religious fanatic who led a heretical church called ""Santa Sangre (Holy Blood),"" the members of which worshipped a martyred girl whose arms were severed by her father following her rape, and then commit suicide. Back in the present, buttressed by shock of his remembrance, he escapes the sanitarium and, in a series of hallucinations and dream-fulfillments, believes he has rejoined his armless mother. He ""becomes her arms"" and the ""two"" undertake a grisly campaign of murder and revenge.—Hallow Looyuh A severely withdrawn, nearly catatonic young man is confined in an institution. Awakened from his stupor, he's taken on a field trip with his fellow residents when by chance he sees someone from his past; the nexus to unspeakable trauma he suffered as a boy. This compels him to re-enact his trauma in a series of flashbacks and violent hallucinations as he struggles to come to grips with sanity, reality, and loss, versus wishful, vengeful, and deadly fantasy.—Lautreamont-Rimbaud In a mental institution in Mexico, the former circus artist Fenix is showing progress in his treatment. Fenix had tragic childhood in the circus owned by his father Orgo, who is a knife thrower. During a performance, his mother Concha, who is a trapeze artist and a fanatic religious woman, sees from the trapeze her husband cheating on her with The Tattooed Woman. She leaves the trapeze, locks Fenix in the trailer and throws acid on Orgo's penis. Orgo uses his knives to cut off both arms of Concha and commit suicide. The Tattooed Woman flees from the circus with her deaf and dumb stepdaughter Alma, who is Fenix's best friend, and Fenix sees everything. One night, Fenix sees The Tattooed Woman in a red-light district and soon he escapes from the institution. He meets Concha and their former friend Aladin and works in a theater, with Fenix performing Concha's arms. Meanwhile, Concha controls him and Fenix begins a crime spree.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film starts with a naked man named Fenix, sitting in a tree in a mental asylum. Nurses come out to him, bringing a plate of conventional food, which he refuses. When he is offered the plate of a raw fish, Fenix descends from the tree and eats as the nurses get him to put on some overalls.Flashback
The film flashes back into Fenix's childhood, which he spent performing as a ""child magician"" in a circus run by his father Orgo, the knife-thrower, and his mother Concha, a trapeze artist and aerialist. The circus crew also includes, among others, a tattooed woman, who acts as the object of Orgo's knife-throwing feats, her adopted daughter Alma (a hearing-impaired, voiceless mime and tightrope walker whom Fenix fancies, with the feeling mutual), Fenix's dwarf friend Aladin, a pack of clowns and a small elephant. Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman, and their knife-throwing act is heavily sexualized.Concha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers, as its patron saint, a little girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers. Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the owner of the land, and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers. A Roman Catholic Monsignor drives into the conflict, saying that he will prevent its demolition, but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it blasphemous and unworthy (the girl worshipped is no saint, he says, and the supposed pool of ""holy blood"" at the center of the edifice contains just red paint), so the demolition is carried out. Fenix leads Concha back to the circus, where she finds out about Orgo's affair, but Orgo, being also a hypnotist, puts Concha in a trance and rapes her.The circus elephant then dies, much to Fenix's grief, and a public funeral is conducted, in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket. The casket is then dropped into the city dump, where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the meat. Orgo consoles his son by tattooing a spread-eagled phoenix onto his chest, identical to the one on his own chest, using a knife dipped in red ink. This tattoo, Orgo says, will make Fenix a man.Later on, Concha, during her trapeze act, sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top. She chases after them and, seeing them sexually engaged, pours a bottle of sulphuric acid onto Orgo's genitals. Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms (much like the girl previously venerated). He then walks into the street and slits his own throat. Fenix witnesses this, locked inside a trailer. He then sees the tattooed woman driving off with Alma.Flash-forward
Back in the present, Fenix is taken out to a movie theater, along with other patients, most of whom have Down syndrome. A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take cocaine and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute. Fenix then spots the Tattooed Woman, who is now a prostitute, and becomes filled with rage. Back in the asylum, Fenix's armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down a rope from his cell window. The Tattooed Woman is shown trying to prostitute Alma, who runs away and sleeps on the roof of a truck. The Tattooed Woman is then mutilated and killed by the hands of unseen woman.Mother and son go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms so that they appear to be Concha's arms that are moving. But Concha soon starts to use her son's hands to kill those women whom she deems a threat to her, including a young performer that he kills with a knife-throw, as well as a cross-dressing wrestler, whom he slashes with a katana. A dream sequence subsequently shows that he has killed many more women, all of whose memories haunt him.Alma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha and her house. She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well, but, after a struggle, he manages to plunge a knife into Concha's stomach. Yet she does not die but taunts him by saying she will always be inside him as she vanishes before his eyes. Through a quick series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has actually kept a mannequin of his armless mother for performing on stage and at home, which also now appears in reality to be a thoroughly dilapidated house. He destroys the home-made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns.Alma proceeds to lead Fenix outside the house where police are waiting and order them to put up their hands. As they both comply, Fenix watches his own hands in awe as he does so. And Fenix's realization that he has finally regained control of them brings him joy and peace."

Angela is back, in the form of an angry inner-city camper, on the hunt for blood. Camp New Horizons, on the recycled grounds of the former murders, intends to pair high-class teens with underclass counterparts. Angela, however, has a different plan. Will it be door number one, number two, or number three?—<cecily_frazee@usa.pipeline.com> Angela kills a 17-year-old and travels to the Camp New Horizons assuming her identity. Lilly and her husband Herman are receiving six teenagers from the outskirts and another six from wealthy families to interact at the camp. Lilly, Herman, and Sheriff Barney divide the teens into three groups and they in different directions to escape Angela's massacre.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A young teenage girl named Maria Nacastro (Kashina Kessler) is packing, then heading off to camp. As she walks across the street, she is chased into an alleyway and run over by a garbage truck driven by serial killer Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen), who has the same hair and clothes as Maria. After killing Maria, Angela disposes of her body and the girl's belongings with the garbage truck's trash compactor, before boarding a bus headed to Camp New Horizon, a camp where several youths from both upper and lower class areas are to live and work together in ""an experiment in sharing.""Arriving at the camp, Angela and her companions meet camp owners Lilly (Sandra Dorsey) and Herman Miranda (Michael J. Pollard) and news reporter Tawny Richards (Randi Lane), who interviews the campers one by one, asking their names and where they are from, with Angela assuming Maria's identity. After Tawny does her interviews, she mentions that Camp New Horizon was once Camp Rolling Hills, where Angela Baker had gone on a massacre the previous year, greatly upsetting Lilly. Before she leaves, Tawny asks Angela if she can get her some cocaine, which Angela agrees to do. She sneaks into a storage closet in the main cabin and takes some cleaning chemicals, which she gives to Tawny, who dies upon snorting them some distance away.Once the campers are all settled, Lilly and Herman reveal they will be split up into three groups and will be camping in the woods for several days, and proceed to introduce the third camp counselor, Officer Barney Whitmore (Cliff Brand). Angela realizes he is the father of Sean, one of her victims from the old camp in the previous movie. After a fight is broken up between Riff (Daryl Wilcher) and Tony DeRaro (Mark Oliver) by Barney, the campers are put into their groups, with Angela being sent out with Herman, Peter Doyle (Jarret Beal), Jan Hernandez (Stacey Lambert) and Snowboy (Kyle Holman).While fishing on the lake, Angela grows irritated by Peter constantly setting off firecrackers and returns to Herman's campsite, where she finds the counselor and Jan in the middle of having sex. As Herman attempts to explain the situation, Angela beats him with a log before impaling him through the mouth with and bashing Jan's head in. Having hidden the bodies of the two, she claims they took off when Peter and Snowboy return.During the night, Angela kills Peter by blowing his face off with one of his own firecrackers and beats Snowboy almost-unconsciousness with a log before burning him alive, disposing the rest of the bodies in the fire as well. She then roasts marshmallows over the fire.The next morning, Angela travels to Lilly's camp, telling her that Herman told her to switch into this camp. As she escorts Arab (Jill Terashita), who she claims she was told to be exchanged with to Herman's camp, Angela decapitates her with an axe. During a trust exercise organized by Lilly, Angela kills Cindy Hammersmith (Kim Wall) by raising her up a flagpole and dropping her from the extreme height, having grown tired of the girl's whiny and bigoted behavior. Angela explains away Cindy's absence by saying she had fallen ill and returned to Camp New Horizon.During another trust game, Angela is tied to Bobby Stark (Haynes Brooke), who she tells to meet her at the main cabin later on, claiming she will take care of Lilly. Upon returning to the camp, Angela convinces Lilly to go to the main camp, where she knocks the woman into a hole filled with garbage and buries her up to her neck. She kills her by running over her head with a lawnmower.Later that night, Angela kills Bobby outside Camp New Horizon by tying him to a tree and tearing his arms off with the Mirandas' jeep, the keys of which she had earlier taken. After killing Riff by pinning him to the ground with tent spikes, Angela heads off to the remaining camp.In Barney's camp, Angela once again claims that Herman told her to switch with another camper, in this case Marcia Holland (Tracy Griffith). Angela's plan is getting complicated. Barney insists on escorting the two to Herman's camp, prompting Angela to fake a leg injury. Taking Angela to the main camp to treat her wound, Barney correctly surmises that she lied about having to exchange with another camper. As Angela tells them about how she hated being with Herman and Lilly, due to the formers pervertedness and the latter's laziness, she tells Marcia and Barney that Lilly is just outside. Upon finding Lilly's decapitated body propped up in a chair, Angela reveals the situation to Barney. After Marcia is told by Angela how much she reminds her of her old friend Molly Nagle, Marcia flees, while Barney confronts Angela, who reveals her true identity to him before shooting him with Riff's stolen gun. With Barney dead, Angela chases and captures Marcia using the Mirandas' jeep.That night, Angela meets Tony, Greg Nakyshima (Chung Yen Tsay) and Anita Burcham (Sonya Maddox) at Barney's camp, telling them that Barney and Marcia told her to bring them to the main cabin. Upon reaching Camp New Horizon, Angela ties the three campers together under the pretense of playing a trust game, before revealing that she has murdered Barney and that they have two minutes to find Marcia, who is hidden in one of three cabins. After frantically searching the cabins, the group finds Marcia in the third, where Greg and Anita are killed when they spring a trap set by Angela.

As the two women fight, Marcia gains the upperhand, repeatedly stabbing Angela in the stomach with a knife until she is stopped by Tony. As Marcia and Tony go off to seek aid, Angela lies severely wounded, exclaiming ""You try to do something nice for someone... and look what happens.""Later, while Angela is loaded into an ambulance, Tony, while waiting in a police car with Marcia, reveals his plan to move to Ohio to be with her, only for Marcia to tell him she already has a boyfriend, much to Tony's disgust.In the ambulance, an attending paramedic and police officer discover Angela is still alive and contemplate killing her for all she has done. Before the paramedic and officer can act on their plan, Angela awakens and stabs them to death with a syringe before collapsing again.

The Church,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094860/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An old Gothic cathedral built over a mass grave develops strange powers that trap a number of people inside with ghosts from a 12th Century massacre seeking to resurrect an ancient demon from the bowels of the Earth. A church is built during medieval times on top of a pile of dead bodies that were considered possessed. Hundreds of years later a young librarian unleashes the evil within by removing a rock in the catacombs, and many strange events occur, and many people seem to have changed suddenly. Father Gus, the only one not possessed, must save the city from the pandemonium by finding the ancient secret of the church so it can crumble to pieces.—Nebiros <nebiros@informador.com.mx> In medieval Europe, crusading knights massacre a village full of suspected devil-worshipers and build a large Gothic church above the cursed remains. Centuries later, the elaborate cathedral still stands, but when its sealed crypt is accidentally reopened, a group of people trapped inside the church become possessed by the fury of the damned. Can the blood of the innocent survive this unholy communion, or will the ultimate demonic evil be unleashed upon the WORLD?.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} In the Middle Ages, the Knights Templar invade a supposed coven of witches and they slaughter the community. They dig an unholy collective grave, bury the bodies, and build a church on the top of the corpses. Centuries later, librarian Evan is hired the organize the church's books and meets Lisa, an archaeologist who is researching the church's catacombs. He accidentally unleashes, and is possessed by, an ancient demon. Sooner several visitors are trapped inside the church and possessed by demons. Father Gus and teenage Lotte are the only persons that are not possessed, and Father Gus discovers a secret in the construction of the church that might be the last chance to save humanity.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In medieval Germany, a band of Teutonic Knights massacre a village of supposed devil-worshipers and bury their bodies underground, building a Gothic cathedral over the mass grave as a means to contain the demonic evil within. One of the first to be killed is a little peasant girl wearing a brown cloak and a wooden mask over her face. It is not made clear whether or not the villagers are indeed devil-worshipers (although they are implied to be witches), and the resulting genocide is quite brutal; even the villagers' animals are slaughtered, and one of the Knights falls in among the bodies and is left behind to be buried alive by his own fellow people. It is declared that the church will be a barrier between the world and Hell.In the present day, the cathedral's new librarian Evan arrives for his first day on the job. He meets Lisa, a mosaic artist supervising a restoration of the church's elaborate frescoes, and asks her out on a coffee date. He also meets Lotte, the Sacristan's rebellious teenage daughter, who is lonely and hiding out in the library to avoid going to school. Evan is a likable man, and quickly finds himself among good companions throughout the church. While Evan befriends Lisa and Lotte, as well as the kind-natured Father Gus, he has a harder time impressing the stern, elderly church Bishop. Evan is late for work on his first day, not to mention caught under a desk talking to Lotte, who was showing him a metal bell that makes a noise like horses running when shaken. The Bishop warns Evan not to enter the church's catacombs, nominally due to their instability, and quickly leaves him to his work, though not without berating him for his tardiness.Lisa begins restoring a fresco in the cellar, when she uncovers a hidden compartment containing a mysterious parchment carrying what resembles architectural schematics. Evan sneaks the parchment out of the church under the suspicious Bishop's nose, and goes home with Lisa. They bond over a mutual interest in medieval art and architecture, although Evan is much more zealous about it, talking the entire drive back to Lisa's house as if he is in a trance. The two start to make love in Lisa's bed, but then Evan has a sudden realization and finds hidden Latin text on the parchment referring to a ""stone with seven eyes."" The text is visible when a mirror is held to it. Evan flees, leaving Lisa for the night. Meanwhile, a dinner takes place between Father Gus, the Bishop, and the bespectacled Reverend who conducts sermons. Father Gus is clearly an outsider, his benevolence and hope for humanity unwelcome at the table, not to mention his trouble with learning Latin, which the Reverend purposely tries to get him in trouble for.As Evan explores the catacombs to find the stone later that night, Gus and Lisa experience strange, paranormal visions. Lotte, meanwhile, is caught by the Sacristan after a night out at the shopping mall; the Sacristan berates her about her inappropriate clothing and the late hour of the night, only for her to get past him. The Bishop finds the parchment that Evan had previously stolen, and begins studying it closely. Later that night, searching the cellar, Evan uncovers the stone in a hidden crypt; a seal embedded into the ground above a cross. Evan manages to pry open the seal, revealing a vast, seemingly endless black void. A blue light radiates from the hole and reveals a sack. Evan opens the sack, and is grabbed by hands from the inside before he blacks out. When he regains consciousness, the sack and hands are gone, and his wrists are bleeding. Evan closes the hole and the Sacristan enters, looking for Lotte, who often sneaks out of the church through the catacombs at night. Evan knocks him out and then leaves the church, stopping at a gas station convenience store to call Lisa by payphone, but all he can do is make bizarre noises at her. He is violently ill, but Lisa seems to believe the noises are a prank. Losing control of his hands, Evan tears out his own still-beating heart and holds it up over the cityscape, after which he speeds crazily in his car all through the streets, appearing as if he is flying.At home, Lisa experiences dreams of the unsealed hole in the church and a vast, candle-filled atrium. Awake and waiting for Evan's return, she is attacked by a goat-headed demon and flees in terror. She is confronted by police officers, whereupon she bites their hands in a panic; although they are understanding, they are unsure how to help her, seeing as the demon is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, returning home from the catacombs, the Sacristan begins experiencing the same symptoms as Evan.The next day, Lisa goes to Evan's office, where he is acting strangely. He tries to sexually assault her and she flees, shocked and horrified. Evan likewise menaces the Sacristan's daughter Lotte, threatening to open her stomach with a knife, sending her screaming and running upstairs. Evan and the Sacristan both become increasingly disheveled and violent. Lotte comes sobbing to the Sacristan, accusing Even of trying to kill her, but the Sacristan violently doubts her, declaring that Evan is a good man; he then proceeds to hold his daughter's head over the kitchen sink and wash her mouth out with Irish Spring deodorant soap, leaving a green residue all over her face. She screams after looking up and discovering that the Sacristan has a bright red ape-like demon face, and she flees her family's apartment. Lotte's mother, oblivious, asks the Sacristan to bring her some cooking onions. Lotte runs face-first into the white wedding dress of a fashion model getting photographs taken outside the church, getting the green soap on the dress; the model is visibly upset and tells her off, but Lotte continues to run.The Sacristan is surprised by Lotte's fear. Having a moment of clarity, he rushes to the confession booth, and tells Father Gus that he has become demonically possessed and fears losing control. To Gus's horror, the Sacristan then runs into a crowd of visitors in the main part of the church building, including the vain fashion model from earlier, and the male model posing as her bridegroom; the Sacristan scratches the male model's face, then goes to the cellar and eviscerates himself with a jackhammer, begging for forgiveness before he dies.His death seemingly triggers security mechanisms that cause the church to seal shut, trapping everyone inside. Among the visitors are a class of schoolchildren on a field trip with their nerdy teacher, the fashion models from earlier, a bickering elderly couple, and a teenager biker gang couple whose transport broke down outside the church. The occupants begin experiencing increasingly elaborate and deadly visions. The vain fashion model sees her reflection rapidly age, and in a fit of madness, she tears the skin off her own face. One of the schoolchildren sees his friend turn into his doppelganger before being killed. The teenage biker sees his girlfriend in the embrace of a gargoyle. The other schoolchildren busy themselves with games and mischief, hiding the nerdy teacher's spectacles, and pretending to ride horses up and down the pews. Father Gus is horrified to discover that the Sacristan has committed suicide; he orders the Reverend to call the police, and then proceeds to confront the aloof old Bishop. He discovers him on the rooftop with a stash of occult parchments and schematics for the church. He reveals that he intends to let the evil inside kill the occupants before being unleashed on what he sees as a sinful and corrupt world, before committing suicide. This repulses Father Gus, who sees it as cruel and sacrilegious. He attempts to take the parchments from the Bishop, who accidentally slips and falls, impaling himself on a spiked steeple. Father Gus is devastated, and screams into the night.Those inside the church start dying in droves; the biker couple manage to dig through a thin section of the floor and rappel down beneath the church, but the girlfriend slips through the ground and falls. She is saved by her boyfriend, who manages to grab onto her arm, where she dangles and screams, only to notice two approaching yellow lights - this turns out to be an oncoming subway train in what is revealed to be an underground tunnel that she fell into; the train strikes her, causing her head to explode and killing her instantly. The Sacristan reanimates, now completely possessed, and kills the nerdy schoolteacher. At a disco floor in town, Lotte senses something wrong and rushes back to the church, using a secret passageway in the aqueduct to get inside. Meanwhile, Lisa enters into a trance and wanders into the cellar, finding herself in the same candlelit atrium of her dreams. Surrounded by the reanimated specters of the church's victims, she lies atop an altar and is raped by Evan, who is now fully transformed into the same goat-like demon from earlier.Lotte bumps into Father Gus, who assures her that he won't hurt her, and the two team up to find a way to stop the evil happenings going on in the church. Searching the Bishop's office, Father Gus finds the ancient records recounting the church's creation. Lotte enters, and upon sees someone who looks like her in a woodcut depicting the centuries-old massacre of the devil-worshipers who'd been buried beneath the church; the person, the little peasant girl from the start of the film, is implied to have been Lotte in a past life. Suddenly flooded with memories from centuries prior, Lotte reveals that the church's architect was tortured brutally and left to die in the church he had built, accused of being an alchemist sorcerer (the architect bears a strong resemblance to the Sacristan). Lotte further reveals that his body contains a self-destruct mechanism for the entire building. Father Gus tells Lotte to flee, promising that he will reunite with her later on outside the church, and he makes his way through the cellar and to the chapel hall as the dead bodies of the massacre victims from centuries earlier begin to rise. Father Gus reaches the altar, and finds a massive pile of reanimating corpses rising out of the ground. He finds the architect's body hidden beneath the floor, and activates the self-destruct mechanism. The building collapses, killing everyone inside, including himself, Lisa and Evan. Only Lotte escapes.Some time later, Lotte returns to the ruins of the church with flowers for Father Gus, her parents, and all of the other lives lost. A passing truck uncovers the stone seal and blows it open. As Lotte hears the sounds of horses running, blue light emits from within, just like when Evan first opened it, and she smiles enigmatically."

Samantha confronts Heidi, insults her, and reveals her relationship with Bletch. Robert confesses his love to Lucille, and the two become engaged. Sidney, Arthur's friend and member of the team, receives a visit from his former wife Sandy with his alleged son Seymour (Seymour comically resembles Sidney very strongly). Sandy informs him she will be preparing a paternity case against him.At a toilet in the mens room, the second most important star of the show, Harry, is suffering from a mystery disease. Meanwhile, Wynyard (the drug addicted knife thrower) tells Robert his story of Vietnam, and convinces Robert to give him $50 to buy drugs from Trevor. After seeing Trevor's latest porno film, Bletch decides they need a new porn star, and Trevor chooses Lucille; he drugs her and tries to rape her as an audition but is caught by Robert. When he walks in on the scene Robert thinks that Lucille was drinking and throwing herself at Trevor, and tells her he never wants to see her again.The last part of the film takes place during the prime-time show. After a good beginning (they sign with a TV chain), Bletch confesses to Heidi that he actually hates her and wants to give the main role to Samantha. After trying unsuccessfully to attempt suicide, Heidi goes on a shooting spree and kills many of the cast.The whole film is told concurrently among all of these sub-plotline stories happening along with the action.Love TriangleA distraught Heidi runs to Bletch after being insulted by Trevor. Bletch is having sex with Samantha, but hides the tryst. Although Bletch is physically disgusted by Heidi, he insincerely comforts her since he needs her talent on the show.Later Samantha insults Heidi, claiming Bletch really wants Samantha. Distraught, Heidi drowns her sorrows by eating an entire chocolate cake, as she reminisces about her past romance with Bletch in a black-and-white flashback to her days as a lounge singer. Flatulence caused by the cake causes Heidi to lay waste to the set during the rehearsal of a feature number; Sebastian then lambasts her. Heidi rushes to Bletch for emotional affirmation, but he is unable to spare her the sight of Samantha performing oral sex on him. Heidi locks herself in her room and refuses to perform, but relents after Bletch has make-up sex with her.Heidi's performance helps secure the Feebles a syndicated series. Shortly afterwards, Heidi attempts to seduce Bletch in his office, but Bletch completely disowns her since Samantha is now to be the star of the show. Unfortunately, Bletch is unaware of Heidi's extremely fragile mental state.Robert and LucilleRobert shows up for his first day as a cast member, and is accosted by the Fly, who tries to corrupt Robert into informing on the cast.Arthur rescues Robert and shows him around, where Robert sees Lucille for the first time. Although he is romantically terrified of her at first, he later summons up enough courage to ask her out and they fall in love. Later Trevor drugs Lucille (to manipulate her into performing in his pornographic films). Robert walks in on the drugging, but misinterprets it as Lucille's decision, and disowns her for being a drunk. They make up later after Robert saves her from Heidi's crazed gun rampage, and eventually get married.The Big OneDennis is shown peeping on Harry in a threesome with two female rabbits. Harry feels physically ill after this episode and is accosted by the Fly, who assumes he has a sexually transmittable disease (STD) and wants to publish the scandal. Dr. Quack diagnoses Harry with ""The Big One"". The Fly publishes the scandal in a local tabloid - to the dismay of Bletch, who presumably wants to avoid negative press on the cast. Trevor lures the Fly into the bathroom, where Bletch tears his wings off and flushes the Fly down the toilet. After vomiting all over the stage in the live performance, he finally learns that he only has 'bunny pox'. Unfortunately, while rejoicing in the news that ""The Big One"" will not cause his death, Harry's head is blown apart by a gunshot during Heidi's rampage.SexcapadesTrevor is shooting a porn film in the basement with the Masked Masochist and Madam Bovine. They are interrupted by Robert, who mistakes the scene for torture and tries to save the cow, who in turn accidentally crushes the Masked Masochist, suffocating him. Trevor later replaces him with Dennis (who has a snout resembling male genitalia) to perform 'nasal sex' on Madam Bovine.Drug RunningTrevor is approached by a sniveling Wynyard looking for his fix, but the drugs have not yet been delivered. Bletch is later shown on a golf course consummating a deal with Cedric. However, after testing on Dennis, the drugs provided by Cedric turn out to be household borax, infuriating Bletch. Louie, Cedric's agent, is literally liquefied after being force-fed some of the borax by Bletch's henchmen.Bletch and his cronies venture to the docklands to fight Cedric and his crab-crewmen. Bletch's side prevails after killing Cedric and the crabs, maneuvering past a huge spider, and driving through the insides of Cedric's boss Mr. Big. However, Barry's head is eaten by the spider.When the drugs finally arrive at the theatre, Wynyard is finally able to get his fix, which puts him into a stupor.The ShowWhile the cast performs an opera number, Sebastian lambastes Robert for not acting his part as an extra on the stage. As punishment, he assigns Robert the task of replacing Wynyard's assistant, who has just been killed by Wynyard's knife throwing while going through drug withdrawal. Wynyard guilt-trips Robert into giving him money for drugs, after telling him a horror story about his time in Vietnam (shown as a flashback parodying The Deer Hunter). He eventually gets his fix from Trevor and injects himself into a deep slumber.The acts gradually disintegrate - Heidi nearly destroys the set by botching a swing, the Indian mystic incapacitates himself by contorting his head into his rectum, and Sid's tribble-like pets are crushed by a barrel. Seeing his show in shambles, Sebastian tries to convince Bletch to feature his personal performance, the sexually explicit number 'Sodomy'. This is summarily rejected by Bletch, who physically throws Sebastian out of his office. Sebastian decides to use the number anyway and performs it in front of the live audience, to Bletch's horror.The Elephant and the ChickenSandy accuses Sid of being the father of their chicken-elephant baby, to his dismay and denial. During the live show, Sandy again accosts Sid on stage with the paternity suit. During a later tragic crossfire scene, Sid braves the crazed Heidi's automatic fire to save his baby. His heroism costs the elephant two bloody knee wounds, and he accidentally crushes Sandy's shot-off head after it squawks out one final invective.The ClimaxWhile the live show is proceeding elsewhere, Heidi attempts suicide by hanging, but her weight breaks the chandelier from the ceiling and she falls through the floor. She makes her way to Bletch's machine gun and tries to kill herself, but at the last moment, Samantha shows up and taunts her. Heidi responds by killing Samantha. Meanwhile Wynyard, in a drugged stupor, tries to kill Robert before accidentally killing himself. Sebastian does his ""Sodomy"" number, while Heidi rampages over the entire set on a killing spree. She finally finds Bletch and pumps many rounds into him as well. Bletch lies to Heidi about loving her and orders Trevor to kill her. However, Robert swings in just in the nick of time to kick Trevor, saving Heidi. Heidi then literally blows Bletch's brain out. Realizing that she killed her love, she gives up her gun and sadly sings ""Garden of Love"", leading into the epilogue in which the fates of the six only known survivors are shown."

Nightmare Beach,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095740/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the execution of a motorcycle gang leader convicted of murder, a helmeted biker goes on a killing spree during spring break in Florida. In Miami, the leader of the Demons motorcycle gang, Diablo, is sentenced to the electric chair. Before being executed, he says that he is innocent and was framed by the Chief of Police Strycher in the murder of a young woman. He promises to return from beyond to seek revenge. In the Easter Holliday, the city is crowded by young people when a biker gives a ride to a young woman and electrocutes her on the road. Meanwhile, the body of Diablo is missing in his grave and the Mayor Loomis, Doc Willet, Strycher and Rev. Bates believe his gang has stolen his coffin. When the corpse of the young woman is found, they decide to cover up the information to the press. The football players and friends Skip and Ronny come to the city to forget the defeat in their last game and have a good time. They meet the bartender Gail and soon Ronny gets in trouble with the Demons gang. They beat him and immediately after, he is burned by the mysterious biker. However, Loomis and Strycher press Doc Willet to vanish with Ronny's body. When Skip decides to look for his friend, he finds a ring of corruption in the city while the mysterious biker proceeds his crime spree.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil At dusk, a number of bikers are standing together outside a prison as if in mourning. Inside, Diablo, a prisoner, is led down ""the mile"" for his execution. When strapped in the electric chair, Diablo screams and curses at the guards, in particular the police officer, Strycker. Before he is executed, the prison warden asks if he has any last words or make a last statement. Diablo says: ""I've been framed, but I'll come back to get even!"" The switch is thrown.A few days later, a local policeman says: ""welcome to spring break, the annual migration of the idiot"". Thousands of college students are flocking up and down the Florida east coast for their week of spring vacation, settling in on Fort Lauderdale. Two teenage boys, Skip and Ronnie, are checking into a small hotel where Skip is recognized by the hotel desk clerk as the quarterback who threw an interception at the Orange Bowl.Meanwhile, the cops learn that Diablo's body has been taken from the cemetery. Reverend Bates, who was present at the execution, is at the cemetery, and he reminds everyone of Diablo's last words. That night, a girl is hitchhiking, and a biker clad in black leather stops. She asks the biker if he is going to Manatee Beach for spring break, and he slowly nodes his head. After driving at a breakneck speed, the girl complains. The biker stops and lets her off, and then electrocutes her to death with a system attached to the motorcycle.The next day, Skip and Ronnie almost get into a scuffle with the Demons, the motorcycle gang whom Diablo was the leader, outside a local bar. Officer Strycher shows up and stops the Demons from doing anything, and the boys go inside the bar. Skip meets Gail, the bartender, who was seen in the opening scene at Diablo's execution. Skip does not seem to be into the bar scene, and Gail seems impressed by the football player. Skip also turns down a date with Rachael, the Reverend Bates' daughter. Ronnie is later picked up by Trina, a lady biker of the Demons. She leads him into an alley where the Demons proceed to beat him up and rob him. After the Demons leave the scene, the mysterious helmeted, black-leather-clad biker shows up when Ronnie is able to stand up. Ronnie takes a swing at him, steadies himself with the motorcycle, and is electrocuted and incinerated.When the mayor of Fort Lauderdale hears about this latest killing, he wants to cover up Ronnie's murder so that no one will suspect a serial killer. While looking for his friend, Skip spots Trina wearing a football medal similar to the one Ronnie had. She tells Skip that she got it from her ""old man"", but Skip, who does not believe her, follows Trina to the Demons hide out. Skip is spotted and captured and when the Demons prepare Skip for another brutal beating, Strycher arrives with a warrant; he is looking for Diablo's body.Back at the hotel, a voyeuristic clerk is murdered while peeping through a small hole in the wall of a closet.

Before she can escape in the elevator, the killer murders her.Gail goes with Skip, first to the hospital for his injuries, and then to the police station to report Ronnie's disappearance. Later, Skip waits for Dr. Willet in the doctor's car and demands to know where his friend is. Dr. Willett tells him where Ronnie is buried. Skip travels to the cemetery where Strycher finds Skip, threatens him and orders him to leave town.Meanwhile, Dawg (the Demon's new leader since Diablo's demise) is arrested for the hotel murders. At the same time, Skip hides out at Gail's place where he tells her that someone might have killed Ronnie. Together, they catch Trina alone and she tells him she does not know who killed Ronnie, and that Diablo did not kill Gail's sister Mary (the murder for which Diablo was blamed and executed for). Earlier, Diablo's innocence was verified by Strycher, who told the mayor, ""you wanted a patsy,"" in reference to Mary's death. Skip and Gail suspect that Officer Strycher to be the one responsible for the killings. They sneak into his place and find photographs of the dead girls.That evening, the Demons bust Dawg from the county jail. When Skip and has a run-in with Strycher, the Demons show up. Dawg shoots Strycher, and the bikers drag the wounded officer around on a chain until he is dead.

Ballet,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096522/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Young American ballerina enrolls in a prestigious ballet school in Hungary. She suddenly becomes inexplicably obsessed with Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and her personality completely changes. A young man in love with her investigates. Young American, Claire Hamilton, arrives in Budapest, Hungary to enroll in a prestigious local ballet school. She meets two more Americans there, young Jason Forrest and his enthusiastic old rich uncle, Zio Joshua, who's attending an art auction. After a visit from a strange woman in black and another young man, Claire becomes inexplicably obsessed with Tchaikovsky's famous ballet ""Swan Lake"" and her personality changes so completely that she starts calling herself Natalie and can't even remember ever meeting Jason. He becomes worried and tries investigating the mysterious man from the school who took Claire in, which puts him in mortal danger. However, nothing can prepare him for what he discovers in the bowels of an old opera house where Claire/Natalie is about to perform Tchaikovsky's spellbinding ballet. This synopsis was written by nevthur:
WARNING: DESCRIPTIONS CONTAINS NUMEROUS SPOILERS:Jason (Gary McCleery), who is working for his cantankerous uncle Joshua (Charles Durning), sees the hauntingly beautiful Claire (Jennifer Connelly) as she climbs the stairs to her hotel room and drops a single ballet slipper behind her. In a Cinderella moment Jason hands her the slipper, introduces himself, and from that moment on he becomes obsessed with her to an almost unhealthy degree. Jason is so distracted by her, that he abandons his uncle in the middle of an important auction of antique clocks when he sees Claire sight-seeing in the auction hall (the clock theme is obviously a reference to the idea that time has stood still, or has become, at the very least, fluid here in this town, an idea further underscored by a scene where Jason wakes up late for work because the array of antique clocks in his hotel room all have the wrong time). In a scene which almost looks as if it was plucked (or ""borrowed"") from the film ""Flashdance,"" Claire arrives for her ballet audition, looks at all the other girls nervously, peeks through the audition room door and sees how difficult its going to be, then becomes even more nervous when she hears the rejected ballerina's tearful account of how poorly she was treated. Claire freezes when they call her name and does not respond. She then gathers her things and leaves quickly. Unfortunately, in her panic and haste, she becomes lost in the theater and ends up standing in the gloom of the main stage where she puts on an impromptu performance (done by a double, not Connelly) which is witnessed by the tormented and haggard looking Marius Balkan (Laurent Terzieff). He says the name ""Natalie"" and Claire freezes. When he drops his cane she runs away. And so is set in motion a new and strange turn of events, where Claire becomes haunted by a past that is not her own (or is it?). When wandering the city with Jason she finds an old mansion that seems familiar. She knows exactly where the spare key is hidden and enters the house where she discovers numerous effigies of swans and paintings all of which reference ""Swan Lake,"" the ballet which she has told Jason is her absolute favorite. The next time Jason sees her in the park by the mansion, she is sitting alone in an old fashioned dress, watching the swans swim on the pond. She no longer responds to the name Claire. And in a moment of unintentional humor, the otherwise brilliant composer Jurgen Knieper makes the most unfortunate choice to use a tremolo string motif that sounds exactly like the ""Twighlight Zone"" theme just as Claire reveals that her name is not Claire, but ""Natalie.""From this point on the story focuses on Jason's struggle to bring Claire back to reality, and his eventual discovery that she's not, as he first thinks, confused or insane, but rather there are powerful and dark supernatural forces in play. He discovers Natalie was a dancer who died long ago after she fled a performance of ""Swan Lake"" and the ballet's director, Marius, has been alive for at least a hundred years. Jason must now try to save Claire from the sinister ballet.There are many scenes in this film that could have been cut to make the movie flow better, and there are many edits within scenes which could have been made to make the flow tighter. And there is one bizarre and surreal moment during the climax of the film, which I will not reveal."

Snatched from Mrs Clonkers' Home for Girls on a cold and quiet night by a lumbering giant, the ten-year-old orphan, Sophie, is in for the adventure of a lifetime when the mysterious monster takes her back to his secret land: the distant Giant Country. There, Sophie will find herself in a realm with even bigger giants than her colossal grizzled kidnapper, who, fortunately, is a gentle vegetarian creature tasked with a noble mission. But, sooner or later, the land's flesh-eating inhabitants with the peculiar names will catch a whiff of the tiny human visitor, and then, no one can stand in their way. Now, only Her Majesty, the Queen of England, can thwart the ugly giants' sinister plans. Can Sophie's one and only friend--The Big Friendly Giant--protect her and the rest of the world from the horrors that surround us?—Nick Riganas Sophie is snatched from her orphanage early one morning by the B.F.G. (Big Friendly Giant), whom she witnesses engaged in mysterious activities, and whisked away to Giant Country. She is soon put at ease, as she learns that B.F.G.'s job is to collect, catalogue and deliver pleasant dreams to children. She joins him that night, but the mean giants follow them, planning to eat the children. Sophie enlists the help of the Queen, by making up a dream for her, and with the backing of the armed forces, they defeat the mean giants.—Cynan Rees <cynanrees@hotmail.com> Sophie (Amanda Root) is a young orphaned girl living in the orphanage of the cantankerous and abusive Mrs. Clonkers (Myfanwy Talog). One night, Sophie wakes up and goes to look through the window but sees a cloaked giant blowing something through a trumpet into a bedroom window down the street; whereupon the giant notices her and snatches her to the realm of Giant Country.In his cave, the giant identifies himself as the Big Friendly Giant (David Jason) who blows dreams into the bedrooms of children at night, while all the other 9 giants are vicious, child-eating beasts. Because the BFG refuses to eat people or steal food from humans, he subsists on a revolting vegetable known as a ""Snozzcumber"", which is all that grows in Giant Country. He explains that he took her so she couldn't tell anyone that she had seen him and start a giant hunt. Sophie and the BFG quickly become friends; but Sophie is soon put in danger by the sudden arrival of the Bloodbottler Giant (Don Henderson), who suspects the BFG of harboring a human after hearing him talking. The BFG tricks the Bloodbottler into eating the Snozzcumber to repel him from his cave, during which Sophie is almost eaten. The BFG makes her a new dress out of her blanket to replace her ruined nightgown while she has a bath. When Sophie announces she is thirsty, the BFG treats her to a delicious fizzy drink called ""Frobscottle"", whose bubbles go downwards, which causes the drinker to fart; this is known as a ""whizzpopper"" to giants, and causes the drinker to soar and shoot around the place.The next morning, the BFG takes Sophie to Dream Country to catch more dreams, but they are first tormented by the other giants along the way; notably by the Fleshlumpeater Giant (Don Henderson), who is the largest and most fearsome and hideous. In Dream Country, the BFG demonstrates his dream-catching skills to Sophie and teaches her to fly; but the BFG mistakenly captures the worst kind of nightmare. Upon arriving at his Dream Cave, the BFG shows Sophie all the dreams he has captured already and locks away the nightmare in his cavern of lava in a tiny chest, and takes Sophie to watch him on his dream-blowing duties; but this is cut short when they spot the Fleshlumpeater eating a little boy whom the BFG had previously given a pleasant dream. When Sophie tries to intervene, the BFG flees with her and escapes to save her from the Fleshlumpeater. Afterwards, the grief-stricken Sophie tries to persuade the BFG to stop the evil giants.At first, the BFG is reluctant to do so out of cowardliness and low trust in humans; but Sophie develops a plan to expose the evil giants to the Queen of the United Kingdom (Angela Thorne). Using dreams from his collection, the BFG creates a nightmare, blows it into the Queen's bedroom, leaves Sophie on the Queen's windowsill to confirm the dream and retreats into the palace gardens when Sophie calls him. Because the dream included foreknowledge of Sophie's presence, the Queen believes her story, and speaks with the BFG. After considerable effort by the palace staff, the BFG is given a copious breakfast.Once ready, the British Army and the Royal Air Force, in a fleet of RAF Chinook helicopters, follow the BFG to Giant Country to the 9 giants' homeland, where the giants are tied up and taken prisoner. The only one isn't there is the Fleshlumpeater, who immediately attacks the BFG for his betrayal and later pursues Sophie when she intervenes; but after a long chase he is stopped when the BFG kills him with the nightmare he had captured earlier, which he later reveals was a nightmare about Jack and his beanstalk, both of which all giants, including the BFG himself, fear.The tethered giants are then all transported by the helicopters to London, where they are imprisoned in a deep metal pit and forced to eat Snozzcumbers for the rest of their lives. The orphanage is closed down so the children move into the palace and Mrs. Clonkers is given the job of feeding giants. Contrary to the book's ending, the BFG stays in Giant Country instead of moving to England, and Sophie becomes his assistant at the distribution of dreams and people think they will visit Buckingham Palace sometimes."

Traveling across the wind swept landscape, Matt and Byron are relentlessly pursued by the officers, and Matt finds Byron isn't what he appears to be, as they travel from community to community and encounter pockets of strange societies that live beyond the slipstream.—Daniel Williamson A barren Earth, with rocky dry hills and a slow narrow stream of water. A female narrator voice-over says that pollution has destroyed the surface of the planet, and that the huge wind stream now rule it: the most dangerous situation is called Slipstream- it's like a river of wind. In that scenery, an airplane with a square tail is flying after Byron (Bob Peck). Soon, William ""Will"" Tasker (Mark Hamill) and Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) capture him. He says the renown sentences: ""It's over. End of the hunt."", and makes a comment saying that Byron thought that the winds would help him. Byron says that he's heard god's voice. The two police officers take him to the small Western-like town which they are the police force of.

There is another diversion - a small plane crashing on them - allows Owens to take Byron away with him. On the plane, Byron doesn't talk at all while Matt feels all right and worries about Byron creating trouble, as he prefers to produce him alive.Byron says that he knows he must be punished, although he doesn't clearly state that he had killed anyone. Owens talks about Byron's ideas. Byron says that humanity has lost the battle against nature, but that there is time to re-conquer the planet. Owens is a very capable pilot, and he flies through sharp mountain ranges á la Star Wars until he reaches a town whose houses have been carved on the hill rock. Byron is able to uncuff himself.

Maya tries to convince Trevor.Tasker and Belitski appear, and they make a deal with Matt: the poison's antidote in exchange of Byron. During the night, strong winds make navigation really difficult. Tasker and Belitski tell Matt that Byron is an android, a robot which wants to behave as human - that's why it was said that he wasn't born from a man. Byron is in a kind of square kite and Matt goes up to release it. Byron says that Tasker - who is ascending by way of a parachute - may join them, but Matt is more realistic and knows that they won't. Belitski says she knew that Matt Owens' word could not be trusted. The thing falls down to the floor.Ariel wants to go with them. Matt goes on wanting his reward, and Tasker mocks the machine who wants to behave as a human. Although Ariel has fought the police officers, she walks on and closes the door after her.

Ariel wants a life which is more than mere survival from day to day. Everybody dances, and Byron does it very well.Ariel defends the idea that Byron may solve the air conditioning problem. Avatar (Ben Kingsley) oposes the idea of using an android: he deems the wind problem an unsolvable problem. He and the mother (Jennifer Hilary) are outraged that an android has shagged his daughter (Maiser Asghar), and even Ariel saying that only Byron is the android - he slept with Ariel - doesn not help Byron's cause. Byron says that he's been able to sleep and that he dreamt. Matt's decided to let Byron go. Byron seems shocked at the news. Byron is happy to have the change of either staying or going.But Bielitski and Tasker reach the hidden town. Byron is terrified: he doesn't want to be free to go if Ariel doesn't want to leave without him. Avatar says that the community is responsible of judging Byron. Ariel believes that Byron didn't kill anybody. Tasker threatens to kill everybody. The people in the community take Byron to Tasker. Bielitski shoots Matt with another dart. He punches her and ties her to a bed.Tasker leaves with Byron. The strong winds force Byron to take the reigns of the plane. However, the plane crashes and Tasker dies. Byron is distraught that Tasker thought that he could have saved him.Matt is with his new girlfriends, and he finally has his fancy-designed balloons flying off onto the sky - a bright but a bit cloudy day with a soft breeze at the most."

Pinky dies when he lands in a large satellite dish below.Later, Duckett explains about Pinky keeping his mother's body iced, and then explains what he has figured out -- that Pinky started slipping over the edge before Pinky ever met Joleen. The passive, but dangerously-disturbed Pinky has been keeping ice on his mother's body for weeks and leaving her TV on because he didn't want to believe that she got sick and died-- he really didn't want to believe she was gone. Pinky had to somehow get food for himself, so when Pinky went to the supermarket to get food, and Ferrell denied him, he shot and killed Ferrell. Pinky had to live somewhere, so when Agnes went after Pinky, angrily demanding that Pinky pay rent that he couldn't afford, Pinky killed Agnes. Pinky became obsessed with Joleen, so when Joleen, Charlie, Amy, and Louise went to leave, Pinky blew up the car with Amy in it to stop Joleen from leaving.With everything resolved, Charlie, Joleen, and Louise leave Banco in Charlie's car having been refueled, and they head home to California."

After the devastation of Godzilla's resurgence, a miniature arms race ensues to collect his cells. The cells are obtained by the middle eastern nation of Saradia, where geneticist Genichiro Shiragami is tasked to study them. However, the cells are sought by various groups leading to a terrorist attack that kills Dr. Shiragami's daughter Erika.

Godzilla had been lured into the crevice of a volcano by solar noises and teams have begun repairing the city. In the rubble, a radiation containment team discover pieces of Godzilla's flesh lying among the ruins. Upon picking up samples, the group is mercilessly gunned down by a team of mercenaries who take the samples of Godzilla's DNA. A sunglasses-wearing agent kills the escaping unit and takes the briefcase with Godzilla's samples within. The Saradian Oil company then employ Dr. Shiragami to convert their desert country into farmland which they plan to use Godzilla's reproducing cells for. However, a terrorist group breaks in, destroying the remaining cells and killing Shiragami's daughter Erika in the bombing.5 years later, Shiragami has returned to Japan and merged Erika's remaining cells into that of a large rose bush in an attempt to preserve her soul. Other members of the department have been collecting the cells in order to make a weapon should Godzilla escape from his volcanic grave. Their weapon is dubbed ""Anti-Nuclear Energy bacteria."" They approach Shiragami to help supervise the project with some remaining of Godzilla's cells, but he refuses. Soon after, the volcano begins erupting and Godzilla begins slowly emerging from the fiery chasm. Since the anti-nuclear weapon is not finished yet, the Japanese Government sends their only available weapon, the newly improved Super-X 2 to fight Godzilla. The main weapon within it is the reflective mechanism that can reflect Godzilla's flaming breath upon him should he attack it.Meanwhile in Shiragami's lab, several terrorists break in to try and steal his research but are attacked by the agent wearing dark sunglasses who is revealed to have been working with the Saradian company all along. Suddenly in the firefight that breaks out between them, the mutated rose bush Shiragami has been working on comes alive and kills some of the fighters. The next morning, a gigantic rose-like mutation is seen protruding from the harbor. Shiragami observes this and dubs it the name ""Biolante."" The Biotech company threatens to detonate missiles at the volcanic crater and free Godzilla should they not receive the anti-nuclear material. During the trade, the Saradian agent attacks and steals the material before setting off the missiles which detonate and free Godzilla. He roars angrily and begins his terrorizing trek towards the city. As he does so, Biolante comes alive and begins screeching.Godzilla is chased into the harbor where he is attacked by Japan's air-force and navy. However, despite the heavy missiles and artillery fired upon him, Godzilla fights back and destroys many naval vessels and jets, reducing their attempts to stop him into rubble. The Super X 2 is sent out to battle Godzilla. This unmanned aircraft reflects Godzilla's fire upon himself but does not seem to hurt him. He instead manages to damage the Super X 2's fire mirror, forcing it to turn back. Biolante begins mutating and grows teeth. Shiragami begins to fear that it is no longer his daughter's soul within the plant, but Godzilla's violent influence. Godzilla approaches Biolante and the two begin battling with Godzilla becoming bound within its tentacle-like vines. Shiragami oversees this and deduces that both Biolante and Godzilla are the same thing and that only one of them must remain on this earth, hence the battle to destroy each other. Godzilla breathes back with his flaming breath and destroys Biolante, only for Biolante to regenerate until it retreats.Godzilla begins marching towards a nuclear power plant in Osaka to regenerate his power having been drained from his battle with Biolante. Godzilla begins his rampage on Osaka and is attacked by Super X 2, having been repaired, but Godzilla easily destroys it. He is then shot with several bazookas with the Anti-nuclear substance within. Despite being hit, he does not seem to be hurt since the weapon within him is only triggered when is hot. He kills the men who shot him and the government begins trying to find a way top make his body temperature rise. Biolante regenerates and takes the form of a hideous doppelganger resembling Godzilla. Biolante and Godzilla engage in a brutal battle with Biolante projectile vomiting upon Godzilla, urging his temperature to rise putting the anti-nuclear weapon within him to take effect. Godzilla collapses on the shore. Despite speculation of collecting Godzilla's cells for research, Dr. Shiragami refuses to do so, saying he has learned his lesson from Biolante's existence. He then muses that scientists like him are the only real monsters in their creations of such abominations.Having defeated Godzilla, Biolante disintegrates into the heavens and Shiragami sees the soul of his daughter finally freed from the creature he created. Upon viewing this in wonderment, Shiragami is shot in the back by the Saradian agent. The agent attempts to escape but rushes upon a radiation plate and is incinerated by lightning. Godzilla awakens, the ocean water he collapsed into having cooled his body temperature. Instead of attacking the city, Godzilla observes the people gathered nearby and then turns around and swims off into the ocean. Dr. Shiragami dies of his wound and is finally at peace."

A computer mixup assigns him to share a dorm room with Alex, whom he presumes is another guy--but ""Alex"" is the beautiful, outgoing Alexandra. At first she gets on his nerves by partying and being with many different guys. While Christopher tries to get another roommate, Alex helps him in different ways by improving his love life and writing ability. They gradually fall in love with each other, but Alex has a boyfriend, Slash, who comes back for her. When Slash puts her name on the wall of a men's bathroom, she realizes she is better of with Chris. At the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) enrollment office, freshman Christopher ""Chris"" Wooden (Patrick Dempsey) learns that his assigned roommate, Alex Page, checked in six days earlier. Nobody is home when Chris arrives at the off-campus dormitory, but Alex has filled the small apartment with furniture and placed a portable hot tub in the living room, leaving little space. Chris hurries to his theater classes, which include play writing and acting.During an exercise in Ruth Carpenter's acting class, he is dismayed by the antics of an attractive but kooky woman (Helen Slater), who throws herself on the floor and screams. Late that night, a man and woman come into the apartment, waking Chris and keeping him up all night as they make love in the bunk beneath him.In the morning, seeing a figure under the blanket, Chris lays down ground rules about bringing sexual partners into the room, and complains about Alex taking up every corner of their living space. When Alex throws back the covers, Chris is shocked to see that Alex is the crazy woman from acting class. She introduces herself as Alexandra Page. Strait-laced and proper, Chris wonders how the university's compatibility form matched him in an otherwise all-male dorm with a flighty, promiscuous woman. Alex explains that she haphazardly filled in the ""yes"" or ""no"" answers.Chris hears that ""Gooseflesh,"" (Dan Schnieder) another dorm student, is looking for a roommate, but Gooseflesh insists that his girl friend, a life-size love doll named Brandi, does not approve of Chris. In subsequent days, Chris finds himself unable to live with Alex's living room bubble baths and disregard for his privacy. He complains daily to the university housing department.During acting class, as Alex delivers a love sonnet, the lecturer Ruth Carpenter (Barbara Babcock) criticizes her performance as superficial, telling her she needs to use her personal experiences, a ""affective memory"", to gain access to the source of her emotions. Later, as Chris arrives home, a dozen people are having a ""pool party"" in the apartment, sitting on his bed and cluttering his writing desk. Tipsy on champagne, Alex confides to Chris that she is in love with Brian, another student, even though she does not know his last name. That night, Alex awakens Chris to complain that she draws men into her life and never knows which ones to pick.The next day, Alex asks Chris out to dinner, but takes him to a supermarket for snacks. As they discuss their families, Alex confides that her parents are divorced and her wealthy father treats her as a possession. She is surprised that Chris's small-town parents are still married after 25 years.Later, feeling affectionate toward Alex, Chris buys her a string of colorful helium balloons, but as he arrives at the dorm, she rides off on a motorcycle with a man in a leather jacket. Chris joins Gooseflesh and his doll in the campus dining hall and complains that Alex ""came to play"" while he ""came to study."" Gooseflesh, a psychology major, tells Chris he ""doth protest too much"" about Alex. When Alex returns, she introduces Chris to the biker who is named ""Slash,"" (Kevin Hardesey) her new ""fiancé.""Later, as Chris and Alex paint a set for a theater class, he wonders why she has paint all over her, while he is spotless. He asks if she ever thinks before she does anything, and Alex replies by asking if Chris ever does something before he thinks about it. They playfully get into a paint fight, and by the time they run back to the dorm, they are both covered in paint.The next day, Denny Dollenbacher (Marius Weyers), Chris's play writing teacher, gives his one-act, two-character play a ""D,"" and tells him he needs to get ""angry"" on paper in order to give his characters life. That night, as Chris and Alex lie in their beds, they play a song lyric game that leads them to singing and performing ""Get Happy"" and ""Put On A Happy Face."" They dance upstairs to the roof patio, but afterward return to their separate beds.The next day, as Chris laments his failure as a writer, Alex suggests he needs a muse to inspire passion in his writing. When she offers to be that muse, they make love for the first time. They wake up to someone knocking on the door. Alex answers it, and Wally (Aaron Harnick) forces his way in, thinking Chris is Alex. Wally announces that the housing office sent him as the replacement for the roommate making all the complaints. Wally is ready to move in until he sees several ""beefcake"" posters of muscular young men on the door. Anxious to get rid of Wally, Chris slips into one of Alex's dresses and scares him away. Alex comes out of hiding and chides Chris for complaining, but laughs at how he spooked Wally. They frolic and make love together.Over the next several days, Chris's one-act plays get better grades, but after a month of fun with Alex, he worries about the upcoming pre-holiday exams because they have fallen behind on their studies involving reading plays. Chris devises a way for them to study together, but Alex begs off because she is working a charity event that evening. When Alex later goes to a campus carnival, he sees a long line of men waiting in line at a kissing booth, in which Alex is the prize. Chris is angry and jealous when she returns home, but Alex defends herself by claiming she raised $3,000 for the charity. Surprised at Chris's dejection, Alex says she did not realize she could hurt him. Another day later, hearing other students gossiping, Alex goes into the dormitory group shower, despite several naked men being there, and is confronted by graffiti describing ""Easy Alex"" as a ""Whore."" Crying as she tries to rub off the letters, she wails, ""You're all the same!""Later, during an class exercise in which the actors must love each other, Chris and Alex argue. He accuses her of acting, and she accuses him of never expressing his feelings except during exercises. Alex adds that she was never acting with him. They make a dinner date at a fancy restaurant for five o'clock, but Alex does not come back to the dorm on time.Gooseflesh suggests that Chris get a love doll like Brandi. He confides that his ""love"" for the doll is a ruse to scare off prospective roommates and other distractions, such as women. He wants to study full time, finish school quickly, and make money in the real world, so he can retire early and start living. Chris criticizes Gooseflesh's plan because it prevents him from finding love. As they part, Gooseflesh gives Chris his real name: ""Stanley."" When Chris returns to his room, Alex awaits in a sexually revealing dress.At a restaurant, single men send drinks to their table to get Alex's attention. The jealous Chris admonishes her for wearing the dress and, in his anger, accidentally spills a drink on her. Returning to the dorm, Chris threatens to move out and accuses Alex of simply wanting to be wanted, rather than wanting to be loved. At that moment, Slash, Alex's former biker boyfriend, telephones, and Chris leaves.At a bar, he drinks with Dollenbacher, his writing teacher, and complains that following the professor's advice has ruined his life. Dollenbacher responds that Chris's emotional pain will mature him and improve his writing. Returning to the dorm, Chris finds Stanley partying in a water fountain with two, scantily-clad young women, Jill and Dory. Stanley thanks Chris for bringing him out of his shell, and Chris goes to Stanley's room to get drunk with the Brandi doll. Just then, Chris hears two motorcycles as Slash and his greasy friend, Eddie, arrive. The two go to Alex's room. Slash demands that she follow through with her pledge to marry him, but she tells him she loves Chris. Slash grabs Alex and tries to force himself on her. Eddie tries to push Chris away, but Chris knees him in the groin and throws Slash off Alex. In the ensuing struggle, Slash breaks Chris's arm and threatens to cut off his hair, but an approaching siren scares him and Eddie away. But it is not the police, only Stanley 'Gooseflesh' and his two new girlfriends who arrive in a fire engine truck with the sirens blaring to scare the two thugs away.At the hospital, doctors put Chris's arm in a cast, and during final exams, he uses the cast as a ""cheat sheet,"" writing answers on the plaster and concealing them with his sling. However, Ms. Carpenter catches and disqualifies him. Facing a disciplinary board, Chris is told that if he wants to stay at the university, he will have to file for readmission at the registrar's office and take the semester over. Afterward, Dollenbacher confides in Chris that he supported him, which is why Chris was not expelled altogether. Never the less, Chris decides to leave the university and move to New York City to become a playwright there.Later, Stanley is helping Chris pack his bags to take him to the train station to leave for New York. Just then, Alex stands on the dorm roof shouting down to Chris on the sidewalk below. Alex pledges her love to him, but refuses to drop out of school and accompany him to New York City. Chris accuses her of refusing to leave the college ""play land"" that her father created for her. They repeat the acting exercise in which each claims to be worthy of the other's love. Rather than leave, Chris climbs up to the roof and embraces Alex.A closing text in the final shot reveals that Chris and Alex stayed on at the university and graduated together. They both currently live in New York City where Alex is an aspiring actress having done off-Broadway theater and a TV commercial, while Chris recently became a playwright having written a play for Broadway."

They make sure everyone is dead, and then commit suicide themselves by impaling themselves on the master's sword, believing that ""the evil"" will be finished. As the master lays dying, he hears a baby wake up and cry in adjacent room, and he realizes that he failed to make sure everyone was dead, and the mass suicide was all for nothing.Fast forward five hundred years, to 1989. On the banks of the blue Danube, Gail and David make an initially awkward acquaintance. They walk back to their hotel, where the rest of the characters are introduced. First we meet Jonathan, the tennis player, and Mary Lou, the blonde bimbo, an aspiring actress. Richard, who has been invited to see a castle by himself in spite of his wife's protestations of being excluded. Anna, a Scandinavian actress. At the bar, we meet Katherine, a standoffish doctor, and Ray, a laid-back Australian. Next is an unnamed professor. All of them are attending the opening of the castle, having been selected from many applicants. Last to arrive is Count Isht Van Bezeli, their host. The tourists board the bus and drive out of the city toward the castle, passing the sites of Budapest on the way, then out into the countryside.On the way there, the Count tells them the story of the castle. It has been abandoned, untouched even in wartime, for 500 years. The bus hits an animal along the road as they drive through forests and small villages. In late afternoon, they arrive at the castle, where they meet Peter and Susan, who worked for the Count setting up the tours and the dinner. However, neither of them spoke English. The group enters the castle. Gail stops first to examine the bus. As she enters, she sees the Count whisper something to the bus driver. The bus leaves.Appetizers and drinks are being served as the group chats amongst themselves. The Count tells them that lunch will be ready soon, and encourages the group to use caution if they go exploring. The people speculate about the history of the castle, and the wolf stories of the 15th century. The Professor, who has studied the history (or lack thereof) of the castle, is curious, and thinks he might be able to discover the reason the castle was abandoned. He goes off exploring by himself. Meanwhile, Jonathan finds himself attracted to Mary Lou and asks Ray for advice on how to get into her pants. One by one, the other guests start making their way to the great hall for lunch. Gail stops to change clothes first. While she is changing, she hears noises and sees a shadow moving along the wall. Thinking there is a Peeping Tom in the room, she quickly finishes and goes to look, but sees no one. Richard, in the next room, didn't see anyone enter or leave, either.Meanwhile, the Professor's wanderings have taken him to what was once the dungeons and torture chambers. He finds a human skull on the floor. Just then, the door slams closed, and locked. The Professor is trapped. He walks down another hallway, but quickly turns back when he hears ferocious growling from further down. He desperately tries to escape from the room. All the doors are locked. One door finally opens, and the Professor walks into an even darker room - and there there werewolf is waiting for him. Aaaagh!Outside, it is starting to snow. Inside, during lunch, the Count continues to relate the story of the castle, about the mass deaths, which he says he does not know whether they were suicides or murders, and about how the Prince ordered the castle closed. Some of the people, especially Richard, suspect there's something they aren't being told. The Count looks disturbed when he learns that the Professor has gone off to explore, and he excuses himself. He and Peter leave. The others think he may be lost, and his shouts for help won't carry far through the thick walls of the castle. A few minutes later, the Count returns and says the Professor has left, and may be lost outside. The snow has strengthened into a blizzard, making searching for him outside useless. No one is leaving that night, so they go off to look at the bedrooms. Jonathan convinces Mary Lou to come with him to the baths, and Ray and Gail go to another room together. Richard and Katherine, who dated once, go off by themselves. They are still attracted to each other, even though Richard is now married.Gail, still unnerved by the visitor earlier, tells Ray her thoughts. The blizzard was forecast and known in advance, and they had made the trip anyway. The bus was gone, leaving them stranded, and she believes the Professor's disappearance was related. She says he never left the castle, even stating that his coat is still on the rack. She tells Ray about her visitor, and asks him to check the room where she changed for another entrance while she goes to get the Professor's coat as proof. Meanwhile, in the baths, Jonathan and Mary Lou notice that they share the same triangular mark on their arms.Ray inspects the other room, but initially comes up empty. Gail finds that the Professor's coat is indeed gone from the rack. Ray finds a loose brick which turns out to move a heavy wall panel, exposing a secret passage! Gail still has not returned, so Ray takes a candle and enters the passage to explore. Meanwhile, Jonathan puts a move on Mary Lou, causing her to flee.Ray hears grinding stone and runs back to the door, only to find that it has closed behind him. Gail returns, and finds Ray's beer can. Ray watches through a crack in the wall panel and notices Gail talking to someone. Then Gail screams, and Ray sees a large animal pounce on her. Ray returns down the passageway, needing to get away from the door and find another way back into the main part of the castle. He falls down some stairs and passes out momentarily. When he wakes up, he has lost his candle, but uses matches for light. There he finds the Professor's body. He finds another door which leads outside, into the storm. In the other direction, there are more tunnels leading to parts unknown. Ray decides to take his chances outside, hoping to make it back to the castle's front door, rather than enter the dark, unfamiliar, and possibly dangerous tunnels. When he gets there, the entrance is blocked by snow. Thinking he must go back to the other door and try again, the werewolf bursts from the snow and gets him.Inside, the wolf returns and moves the Professor's body. Meanwhile, Jonathan and David start talking. When they leave, talking about how they believe Ray scored with Gail, Peter enters the room and removes the film from David's camera. Anna and Mary Lou are talking in a separate room. The Count enters, having noticed Ray and Gail's disappearance. He looks for them in the last room they were seen in, asking Richard to go look for Katherine, simply wanting to get him out of the room. Jonathan and David arrive shortly afterward, and find the Count trying to enter the locked room, which now appears to be silent and empty. The two men help the Count break into the room, and find that the room is indeed empty. The Count notices the missing candle, and suspects there is a hidden passage. He carefully inspects the walls, and finds the loose brick which opens the hidden passage. Jonathan and David are awed. The three of them take the candelabra and go down the passage, retracing Ray's steps. The Count notes there could be more hidden passages. They arrive at the place where Ray fell. The door leading outside is now locked from the inside, so they think that Ray and Gail entered the tunnels. David finds Ray's watch, which has blood on it. They go back the way they came, through the hidden door (which is still open), to get the others to help search.Back in the great hall, the Count tells them about the tunnels. They were designed as a maze, to confuse invading armies during wartime. Some tunnels led somewhere, most led nowhere. The Count suggests that they divide into four groups, each exploring the three known entrances to the tunnels plus the newly discovered hidden passage. Not everyone is happy with the idea, most notably Richard. The overall consensus is to at least try, and mark the walls with chalk so that they do not get lost themselves. Richard, Katherine, and Peter go to the hidden passage, while the rest go to the other entrances, with kerosene lamps this time. Anna and the Count take one tunnel, David and Susan another, Jonathan and Mary Lou the third. Richard is especially unhappy, and he begins sniping at Katherine.Mary Lou is unsettled, and thinks that they may be being followed, or that they have been down the same tunnels more than once. She suspects that someone may be rubbing off the chalk marks, and sure enough, Jonathan finds a rubbed-off chalk mark. He panics and runs. The others can hear the distant echoes. The Count goes to investigate. Anna convinces him to leave her his heretofore unseen pistol, which she noticed in his coat. Jonathan, having panicked, is now lost, hears growling, and runs blindly through the tunnels, to no avail as he is caught just when he thought he got away.Anna now hears the growling, and calls for the Count, but gets no reply. When a large shadow appears on the wall, she shoots at it. David comes around the corner, having found her, and tries to calm her down. Richard, in another part of the tunnels, hears the gunshots and can take no more, he turns back. David and Anna hear more noises and in a panic, David shoots the gun one more time, narrowly missing the Count, who has returned from his check of the tunnels where he thought the noises were originally coming from. He quickly apologizes. Susan has rejoined them, and they find Mary Lou on the ground. She tells them that a large animal chased Jonathan, leaving her alone. Meanwhile, Peter approaches Richard with a knife. He is bleeding from the head. They think someone attacked him with a rock.Back in the main hall, the remaining people suspect a wild animal, possibly a wolf, had found its way into the tunnels. They can't agree on anything else. Four people are now missing, and the search was a failure. David proposes that they return to the tunnels, thinking that Gail and Ray are still there, not to mention Jonathan. (They still believe the Professor left the castle.) Mary Lou, feeling sick, goes to lie down. Anna and Richard go with her, so that she won't be alone. David and Katherine go back down to the tunnels. The Count remains where he is, to rest his injured ankle.After putting Mary Lou to bed, Richard expounds his suspicions to Anna. Meanwhile, David and Katherine go over what they know as they walk through the tunnels. David shows her the watch. There was a button with it, which Katherine identifies as belonging to the Count, not to Ray. Up in the main castle, Richard and Anna discover more coincidences. Both of them were orphaned as a baby, and had no other family. The same was also true of Mary Lou and Katherine too, how many of the others? Surely that wasn't a coincidence? Anna believes that she knows the Count and that he is honest, but Richard is more convinced than ever that their being here is no accident. Anna, unsettled herself, goes to take a bath.David and Katherine arrive at the location where the shots were fired earlier, and David spots something. It turns out to be Jonathan's body. He has been shot, but he was already dead or dying, from having his throat savaged. They start to wonder if there is more than one animal, and head back. Meanwhile, Richard takes a look at Anna in the mirror, and notices that she, like him, has the same triangular mark on her arm that we saw earlier with Jonathan and Mary Lou. That's one more piece of evidence for his suspicions. But just then, the werewolf breaks through the door and savages him.David and Katherine have lost their way in the tunnels. Finally, they find a chalk mark, leading them back. Katherine notices that the animal story no longer makes sense, since Jonathan was untouched except for his throat. An animal would have savaged or partially eaten him. David hears Gail's voice, she is apparently still alive. He sees a body in the tunnel ahead, it turns out to be the Professor. The dying Gail grabs Katherine's ankle. David returns, just in time to hear Gail say ""werewolf"" before she dies. They both suspect the Count as being behind the killings. He, after all, invited them and hosted them, and could have set them up for this.Back in the main rooms, they go to round up the others. Katherine, checking on Mary Lou, hears noises behind some curtains. She charges it with a pike, only to discover Richard behind the curtain. David returns with nobody, but points out that Richard had already been savaged, his throat was torn out and he was dying anyway. The Count hears the commotion and arrives, recognizing the werewolf's bite, saying the prophecy is fulfilled.David and Katherine confront him about the killings, and he readily admits to what Richard already deduced before he died. The guests were not selected by chance. They all had the triangular mark on their arms, a birthmark, meaning that they were descendants of the family that had occupied the castle in 1489. He now admits that he knows that they died by suicide, and that the baby had been smuggled out of the castle, grown up, and passed on its family curse. It means that one of the descendants is a werewolf. Most of the others arrive, except for Mary Lou, who is still asleep. David accuses the Count of being the murderer. He denies it, and tells them that he is dedicated to finding the werewolf and killing it. It can only be killed by someone who has the birthmark, and the Count was the appointed werewolf killer. He knew that if the castle was opened, all of the descendants would come home. Katherine then confronts him about the Professor, who was found dead in the tunnels despite the Count telling the group earlier that he had left the castle. The Count then accuses David of being the werewolf. Outraged, David points the gun at the Count. Nobody believes the Count, and they lock the Count, with Peter and Susan, in the dungeons, while they figure their next move.David, Katherine, and Anna discuss what to do in the great hall. David and Katherine believe they must kill the Count to protect themselves. Anna would rather report him to the police, and is outraged at the thought of vigilante justice. Anna convinces them to wait until she can wake up Mary Lou, so that she can at least be consulted and have her voice heard. Katherine goes to find her, while David goes to the roof, to see what, if anything, is going on outside. Anna, still believing that the others are wrong, waits until they are both gone, then picks up the gun, the lantern, and the keys, and returns to the dungeons. Outside, the snow is letting up, although it remains cloudy.Anna releases the Count, Peter, and Susan from the dungeons, informing them of the others' plans. The Count is relieved, and congratulates her on a good decision, and retakes his gun. He still intends to kill David, though, and when Anna protests, they lock her in the cell instead. They leave her the key, but advise her to wait two hours before attempting to use it, because if she leaves the cell before the Count returns, she will probably be killed. Meanwhile, Katherine discovers that Mary Lou is no longer in the bedroom, and fears that she too has been killed. Returning to the main hall, she finds Anna gone, and knows that she has gone to set the Count free. Anna, meanwhile, is trying to open her cell door, against the Count's advice. A noise startles her and she drops the key. A shadow falls over her, and she thinks it's the Count, come to release her, but it was the werewolf. It seizes her throat through the bars of the cell.Katherine, going to check the dungeons, hears the Count, Peter, and Susan talking in Hungarian, and knows they have been released. Meanwhile, David, up on the roof, sees Ray's body down on the ground below, but sees nothing else that could be helpful. When Katherine arrives in the dungeons, she finds Anna has been killed, and hears growling behind her. She soon meets the same fate.Now the Count arrives on the roof, making a check of his own. He has left Peter and Susan instructions to kill David, and Susan tries to do so when she hears his voice. David sees her in time, but not understanding what she was trying to do, shakes her and asks her where Katherine and Anna went, even though she doesn't speak English. Peter sneaks up behind him with an axe. Just as he's getting ready to swing, Mary Lou, alive and well, appears in the doorway and shouts. David looks around and ducks, and Peter's axe beheads Susan instead. Mary Lou picks up a crossbow and shoots Peter in the chest, killing him, saving David in the process. And then there were three. She is on the edge of panic herself. David picks up the axe and advises her to hide in the bedrooms and wait, because he must kill the Count before the Count kills them both.Instead of hiding, Mary Lou follows David to the roof, calling for him. The Count hears this, and sneaks up behind her. After convincing her not to scream, he asks her where Peter and Susan are, and Mary Lou tells them that they are dead. He tells them that David is the werewolf, and points to the thinning clouds. Soon, the full moon will appear, and the werewolf will transform, unable to help himself. Mary Lou sees David approaching with the axe, and pulls the Count away. The Count pulls the gun, but both men lose their weapons quickly in the struggle. Mary Lou picks it up and tells them to stop fighting, or she'll shoot them. The men stop and face her instead, David telling her to put the gun down, the Count telling her to shoot David instead. They both start to approach, each trying to convince her to shoot, or not shoot. Finally, apparently flustered and in a panic, she shoots the gun. A body falls to the floor.David runs to her, it was the Count she shot. He tries to comfort her, saying there are no werewolves. At that moment, the full moon finally comes out from behind the clouds, and Mary Lou turns to face it, and smiles. Her werewolf-howl is heard as the movie ends...."

Patlabor: The Movie,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100339/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The screwball cops of Special Vehicles Section 2 Division 2 must investigate and stop a spree of rampaging construction robots. A mysterious suicide and a series of unmanned robot run-aways sparks off a Police investigation into the suspicious software on-board thousands of industrial robots around Tokyo. Step by step, the police find themselves tangled up by the web of a perfect crime which awaits the approaching Typhoon to activate thousands of virus affected robots. As time runs out, Asuma and his team must complete a task that is doomed to be a failure before the Typhoon lands Tokyo.—Tzung-I Lin <tzung@hugo.att.com> In the near-future of 1999, Japan has developed giant robot suits, dubbed ""Labors"", which they have employed in various contexts both military and civilian. In the midst of a massive Tokyo land redevelopment program called the Babylon Project, Labors begin moving on their own, sometimes against their pilots' inputs, and sometimes without even any pilot present. The motley crew of TMP Special Vehicles Section 2 Division 2 must investigate and stop this phenomenon threatening the project and indeed the entire country.—ArrowHead83 In the near-future, Tokyo is undergoing a huge re-development program known as the Babylon project. Old suburbs are being demolished and man-made islands are being constructed in Tokyo Bay. Dominating the scene is the Ark, a huge man-made island of steel from where the Babylon project is coordinated. The Ark is also used to manufacture and test labors, large man-operated robots that are used in most of the construction work.One day, as dusk approaches, a programmer by the name of Eiichi Hoba jumps off the Ark, a smirk on his lips, committing suicide.Some time later there are several incidents where labors that were manufactured by Shinohara Industries malfunction, start operating of their own accord and go on the rampage even after they have been turned off. These include construction and military labors alike. These labors are either on routine missions and go out of the pilot's control, or else they are unmanned, which means that they should never have started up in the first place.The police force itself uses labors units to deal with the unruly ones. Division 2 in particular finds itself dealing with incidents almost around-the-clock and no rational explanation can be found for the disturbances.Investigations made by Captain Gotoh and Sergeant Asuma Shinohara of Division 2 conclude that the rampaging labors have one thing in common: each were installed with H.O.S - Hyper Operating System, the latest software program to be installed in the labor computers. At first Asuma assumes that a bug is the cause but Gotoh believes that it was deliberately done by Eiichi Hoba, the programmer who committed suicide.The Hyper Operating System has been installed in all the labors in Tokyo including the Ingram 98 which is used by the police. This puts Officer Noa Izumi, a labor pilot, and the Special Division police force in a worrying state because they fear the labors might go berserk while on duty and harm the public. Shigeo Shiba, the programmer responsible for Division 2's computer systems, later returns from New York where he has been helping to set up similar labor units. He informs the team that he did not install the HOS due to his own doubts about it. Asuma, who has been working to the point of exhaustion on the investigation, is furious to learn that Gotoh knew about this and didn't tell him.Gotoh is a subtle manipulator: he reasoned that not telling Asuma would push the younger man into dedicating himself into finding a solution before anyone got hurt.Meanwhile, at Gotoh's request, Detective Matsui investigates Hoba's background and finds that his work, thinking and convictions were somewhat related to references in the Bible. For example, the Ark could be said to be named after Noah's Ark; a virus Hoba created displays the word ""Babel"" all over the computer screens; and he used the name Jehovah while at MIT. Why he decided to associate this with the biblical references remains a guess but Gotoh does come to the conclusion that Hoba planned this labor rampage for some time and that he committed suicide in order to make his plan irreversible.Asuma and Shigeo continue the investigation and discover that wind speeds can trigger the H.O.S. into making a labor to go on the rampage via resonance caused by city buildings. Using a computer simulation they are horrified to discover that a combination of typhoon-speed wind acting on the Ark could trigger all the labors in Tokyo on to a massive rampage. As if foreseen by Hoba before he died, a typhoon is reported to be on its way towards Tokyo Bay and the Ark.Informed on Asuma and Shige's findings, Gotoh pushes his superiors for clearance to destroy the Ark. Although the conclusions are greeted with skepticism, Gotoh surreptitiously convinces the police commissioner to OK his proposal, agreeing that whatever happens the blame will be put down to the typhoon.As the storm approaches, Special Vehicle Division 2 makes preparations. A top officer, Kanuka Clancy, even returns from abroad in order to aid them in their mission. The squad faces a double-race against time: one group, led by Asuma, must go to the Ark and demolish it before it causes all the labors to go berserk and destroy Tokyo. Meanwhile, back on the mainland, Shigeo must find convincing evidence of Hoba's guilt or else the demolition will not be justified and they could all end up in jail.Asuma's team arrives on the Ark, which has been evacuated due to the approaching typhoon. After fighting it out with some guard robots, Hiromi, Asuma and Shinshi break into the control room in order to set the sequence for the Ark's self destruction. Meanwhile Kanuka, Noa and Ohta cover their backs and battle the activated construction labors that are going on the rampage due to the typhoon.Kanuka uses an AVXO-zero, one of the very latest labors, and which is equipped with the faulty HOS. At first she manages to keep it under control but then it turns against her colleagues.As the Ark is destroyed, the final battle between Ingram and Zero comes down with the Ingram suffering heavy damage. But with quick determination and wit, Noa manages to destroy the zero's PRAM system using her shotgun. With the threat of the labors rampaging across Tokyo eliminated at the cost of the Ark, Hoba's plan has been foiled."

Francesco,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097383/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Docudrama about the life of St-Francis of Assisi. The life of St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) as related by followers who gather after his death to tell stories so that Leone can record them: a privileged and virile youth, a prisoner of war, an heir who turns away from his father and gives all to the poor, a beggar for others, and an inspiration to friends who accept the Gospels' life of poverty. He seeks the Pope's blessing, and he endures persecution at the hands of the family of Chiara Offreduccio (1194-1253), who becomes St. Clare. Many join the order he has established and then rebel at his expectations. In near despair - and ill - he writes a Rule to take to the Pope; then, the Lord sends him a message. He dies smiling.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> in flashback, the film relates Francis of Assisi' evolution from rich
man's son to religious humanitarian and eventually to full-fledged
saint. Francesco was based on Herman Hesse's Francis of Assisi,
which director Liliana Cavani had previously filmed in 1966. The Saint
and founder of the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor is played by
Mickey Rourke and his inspiration, the woman who later became
Saint Clare is played by Helena Bonham Carter. Raised as the
pampered son of a merchant, Francis goes off to war, only to return
with a profound horror for the society which generated such
suffering. In one scene, as an act of renunciation, he strips himself of
his fine clothing in front of his father, and leaves the house naked
and barefoot, joining the lepers an beggars in the poor section of
town. The film follows with a series of episodes from the saint's life
rather than a coherent narrative follows, up until his final days when
he receives the stigmata, or wounds similar to those on the body of
Jesus at the crucifixion."

Following this they were imprisoned in a concentration camp. In a speech designed to please the SED and DEFA, the older gay man explains how the communists helped him through his struggle.The film ends with a scene in the classroom, as the headteacher - who obviously has discovered Philipp's sexual orientation - says that she and a group of teachers need to observe his classes to see if he's still suitable to teach.

In the mid 80s, 45 or so years after the age of the ""aventis,"" a doctor and a nurse-nun (who grew up together, and now are co-workers in a hospital) identify the corpse of one of the main characters of the ""aventis"" of their childhood and adolescence. Besides the interesting flashbacks - a chronical of the Civil War in a ""typical"" Barcelona microcosm itself, the discovery of this body (belonging to someone long presumed dead) leads to other surprises and unresolved doubts, several decades later.—Guy33134"

One day Anju and Manju are taken for each other and what results is absolute chaos, as each try to fit into the other's shoes.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Born as twin sisters, Anju (Sridevi) and Manju (Sridevi) are separated immediately after birth thanks to their mentally handicapped nanny Madhumati (Aruna Irani). Anju ends up with her uncle Tribhuvan (Anupam Kher) and Tribhuvan's sister-in-law Amba (Rohini Hattangadi), while Manju is raised in a slum environment. Their parents were killed in a car accident (when Anju was 10 yrs old) orchestrated by Tribhuvan. However, in their will, they declare that their daughters will inherit their wealth once the twins turns 21 (if they die before that, the wealth goes into a trust). This results in Tribhuvan and Amba bringing Anju up as a coy and easily frightened girl (by giving her regular drug injections), merely keeping her alive so she can sign off the property in their name. The house servant Lokesh ""Dadda"" Sharma (Annu Kapoor), Anju's younger brother Raja (Aftab Shivdasani) and a pet dog sympathize with her plight.Anju likes classical dance and is unable to resist the urge to dance whenever she hears Indian classical music. On his birthday, Tribhuvan hosts a grand party. Among the several guests attending is his friend Vishwanath (Saeed Jaffrey), who is generally kind towards Anju. When Indian classical music plays at the party, Anju is unable to resist and bursts out dancing but ends up accidentally slapping Tribhuvan. Although calm at the party, he beats Anju mercilessly with a whip the next day.On the other hand, Manju grows up in a slum as a happy-go-lucky and street smart stage dancer. She spends her days tricking people in the village to forgo her loans and is childhood friends with her neighbor and taxi driver Jackie ""Jaggu"" Pandyekar (Rajnikanth). Madhumati is in a mental hospital and Manju's truth has not yet been revealed to her.
One night she crashes into a bar to drink beer where she meets and flirts with Suraj (Sunny Deol), Viswanath's son. Suraj soon falls for her. Vishwanath has been pestering Suraj to get married for a while now and one day, when he shows him Anju's photo as a prospective marriage offer, he agrees, mistaking her to be Manju. When they visit Tribhuvan's place with their offer, Anju doesn't recognize Suraj and has a panic attack (courtesy of the injections given to her by Amba), which scare Suraj and Vishwanath away.The reason Tribhuvan and Amba refuse to attend to marriage offers for Anju is because they want to get her married to Amba's brother Batuknath Lallanprasad Maalpani a.k.a. Balma (Shakti Kapoor). They call Balma to live with them, who soon begins harassing Anju and kills her pet dog when he leaps to her defense. Terrified at the turn of events, Anju runs away from home. On her way, she is harassed by strangers until Suraj saves her. That same day, Manju has a fight with Jaggu and she sets off on her own path. In a twist of fate, their paths end up crossing and while the two never meet, they end up exchanging places.
Thus, an injured Suraj is brought to Anju's house by Manju (who was seen on the streets by Tribhuvan and Abma), while Anju ends up at Manju's slum with Jaggu.Manju falls in love with Suraj.
Manju is easily able to assert control over Tribhuvan, Amba and Balma. While the trio mistake her for Anju and assume her to be weak, Manju surprises them by displaying strength and aggression and has them under control. Meanwhile, Anju starts getting close to Jaggu, who starts falling for the new ""Manju"". The new ""Manju"" is shy, clean, cultured and an ideal wife. He proposes marriage to her, to which she agrees.
Suraj sees Anju with Jaggu and thinks Manju is two-timing them and breaks up with her.The two sisters live their life comfortably until one day, Balma spots Anju at Manju's place and deduces that the one in their house is her twin sister Manju. He hatches a plan and kidnaps Anju, taking her to a bungalow at Alibaug. One of Jaggu's friends overhears Balma speaking to Tribhuvan on the phone and informs Manju, Suraj and Jaggu, who finally understand what's going on. They arrive at the bungalow where Tribhuvan forces Anju to drink poison (after signing the will transferring all assets to Tribhuvan, on her 21st birthday) and also has their nanny captive. Suraj, Manju and Jaggu fight Tribhuvan's goons and save Anju, who finally gets to share a tender moment with Manju. She is taken to the hospital and survives.Finally, Suraj marries Manju while Jaggu end up with Anju and they live happily ever after. They are both blessed with twin girls that are born on the same day."

Grave Secrets,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097456/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman tormented by ghostly apparitions and a professor of psychic phenomena investigate other-worldly disturbances and unlock the secret of a malevolent force reaching out for vengeance from beyond the grave. GRAVE SECRETS aka SECRET SCREAMS-synopsis[THREE MONTHS AGO] Its night and Zack (Lee Ving) comes out of his house as a car comes careening by driven by Iris Norwood (Renée Soutendijk). Just as another car passes, her father Kurt Norwood (Bob Heron) awakens in the passenger seat and attacks her violently. She screams and struggles to free herself from him. Suddenly an oncoming car almost collides with them, with Iris falling out on the road. Kurt is left to steer the speeding vehicle which crashes into a tree.[TODAY] David Shaw (Paul Le Mat) is sleeping in his office chair. He is very haggard-looking as if he has been through a lot. Darla (Olivia Barash) enters and informs him she has finished her exam. She is obviously interested in the professor, asking him to come to her place. David, seeing the time, exclaims that he is late. He gathers his things and leaves.David is conducting a class on the paranormal and showing slides. One of them pictures Dr. Carl Farnsworth (David Warner), a pioneer in paranormal research who was investigating the ghost of a suicidal bride who jumped Carls body and acted out what happened to her. They learned that she had been brutally raped, murdered and made to look like a suicide. Once her story was told in a séance before witnesses she was able to rest in peace. David calls for the lights, and Iris, who was sitting in on the class, gets up to leave. As the class ends, David goes out into the hall to see Iris walking away. Darla approaches him, giving him an envelope. The letter says that his grant has been not approved due to lack of evidence. Darla sympathizes with him but David takes off.Entering Dean Andrews (Gilbert Lewis) office, David asks why he cant get any funding. Andrews tells him to sit down. David reminds the Dean that he has been teaching for ten years, has a good rapport with his students and has submitted many research papers over the years. Pulling them out of a drawer, Andrews recites the titles of each. All of them focus on one woman, Joanna Shaw, who was Davids wife who died three years earlier. He is told to get over his wife and move on.Back in his office, Iris knocks and enters, telling him she doesnt believe ghosts are innocent. They go to a restaurant for coffee. She shows him a brochure of Homestead House, an old house she is trying to run as a bed and breakfast. She tells him of strange noises at night and loud footsteps outside her door. He asks if anyone else witnessed these. She answers no. He suggests that maybe she is making something up and wants him to prove it so she can get business as a haunted house bed and breakfast. She wants to know why he is so cynical. Telling him it is very difficult for her to ask for his help, she hands him a check made out to him for $5000. He looks it over carefully and agrees, asking for the truth. The first question he asks is: does she know the previous occupants of the house? She says no. Second question: have the attacks been increasing in number and intensity? He notices her hand becoming shaky as she holds the coffee cup. She says yes. Third: how do you feel during the attacks? She says threatened. Her hands become very shaky. Fourth: do you know who the ghost is? At this point she crumples the Styrofoam cup and spills the coffee. He rises and says he will get some napkins. She says no, she will do it herself. Going over to the counter, she looks back and sees David getting napkins from another table. When he returns, she is gone. He looks around to see her going out the door. He goes home, turns on the television and looks at the brochure.The next day David is driving and shaving. He stops at Homers Café and Store. Inside, he finds no one in the store, ringing the service bell. Looking around, he goes through a door into the bar, where Zack is seen throwing darts at a board just a few inches from Davids head. Several other men are seen seated. He tries to ask about the inn, but no one pays him attention. Finally he approaches the bartender Homer (John Crawford) and asks for a bed and breakfast. He is told Homers place has rooms for rent. David insists he wants Homestead House. Homer tells him he doesnt want to stay at  that womans house  because she is not hospitable. Told he is not looking for hospitality, Homer tells David the woman is about as hospitable as a whore on judgment day.Later David arrives at Homestead House and finds no one home. Entering, he calls out and begins looking around. In one room he finds an open book with the pages fluttering from a draft coming from an open window. Returning to the front hall, he finds a hotel register and looks at some of the guests. He goes upstairs, still calling out. He goes from room to room, finding one that looks lived in. An open window blows a book onto the floor from a messy desk. On the desk he sees newspaper ads circled for psychics and a camisole which he picks up. Suddenly Iris enters and demands to know what he is doing. He stares at her. She tells him to leave.Outside, David starts to leave as Iris digs a hole near the front of the yard. He tries to start over with her, but she tells him to go. He says it is late and he is hungry. He wont be able to drive back to town and wants to stay. She agrees to one night.In his room David calls Darlas answering machine and leaves a message, telling her to research former owners for Homestead House and send it care of Homers Spa. Looking out the window he sees Zack, who is arguing with Iris. She tells him to leave.In the kitchen Iris has been cutting veggies and is cleaning a meat cleaver. David enters and tries to call a truce. She points out the water continues to run. David says he thinks it is the water pump and volunteers to help. She tells him instead to chop some wood outside.As David prepares to split a piece of wood with an ax, he notices the wind blowing suddenly. He continues working.At dinner David complements her on the food as she pours him a glass of wine. She gets up to open another bottle of wine, telling him he is eating deer meat. He shows a slight repulsion. While she is turned away, he pours the wine into a nearby plant. When she returns with the bottle, she refills his glass, setting the bottle down. He picks it up and fills her glass. Holding the bottle, he indicates that he will reach over to the side to do something and turns away. She takes this opportunity to pour the wine into the plant. Seeing that he has already done this, she looks sheepishly at him. He is now looking at her with a knowing look, having done that to see if she would pour out the wine herself.She asks him to play a game and he agrees. Each must bounce a coin on the table, trying to land in an empty glass. If he fails, he must take a drink of beer. He tells her that instead of her drinking beer, she must answer a question truthfully. She bounces a coin into the glass and he asks how she afforded the house. She tells him she saved money from her real estate job in the city. He is unable to bounce the coin into the glass, so he takes a drink.We see the clock advance two hours. Now the glass of beer is half-full and David is slightly tipsy. He manages to bounce the coin into the glass and Iris asks why he is not married. He confesses that his wife committed suicide after having a stillborn child. He tells her he is very tired and wants to go to bed. She helps him to his bed where he is sound asleep. She leaves the room, closing the door.Later David awakes and hears digging. He looks out the window and sees Iris digging in the front yard again in the middle of the night. He lies back down and goes to sleep.The next morning David gets coffee in the kitchen. He adds milk to it from the refrigerator. As he is drinking, he suddenly notices an egg broken on the floor. He opens the fridge to see if it fell out but finds no eggs inside. There are a dozen or so eggs in a basket on the table. As he turns away again, he hears another egg drop. He looks puzzledly at the two broken eggs on the floor. Then his eyes catch sight of an egg being lifted from the basket. Floating in midair, the egg is hurled and breaks on Davids face.Next we see David setting up his computer and equipment in the house to investigate. He takes measurements of the positions of the eggs and charts the information. As he is doing so, Iris enters and stands over him. She tells him she doesnt want to communicate with the spirit. He says we must or it wont leave them alone. Suddenly a cry is heard from outside. They go out front and see an ax thrown which lands in the porch column. He takes Iris inside. From the trees and bushes we see Zack approaching, laughing.Later we see David writing and making notes. We hear his voice telling us what he is writing. Iris looks at him and asks what he is thinking. He wonders what she is doing in this place by herself. She says she is supposed to have guests. He tells her they leave in a day or two. She says she felt safe when she first moved there, before the troubles began. At this point we see a phonograph record floating in the air, which is noticed by David. The record is removed from its sleeve and placed on a turntable and played.  Fur Elise  by Beethoven plays. Iris looks around and notices the clock says midnight. She tells him the sequence has begun. David activates the cameras to tape from a remote. They observe a book being lifted and carried over to David, who takes it. At this point heavy breathing is heard. David is seen choking, telling her a man is doing it. She rises to help him and a loud scream is heard. Davids throat is released and he says he thinks he is in the mans chair. The book falls to the floor. The house begins to shake and the needle skips on the record. Then the fire goes out and the lights also. Grabbing a flashlight, David hears heavy footsteps on the stairs. They go up and the footsteps stop. Next the flashlight goes dead. David looks into a room but sees nothing. He approaches her on the steps and stands against the wall. She asks what he is doing, and he suggests the spirit might be making contact. He calls to the man, who opens and closes a door and pushes between them, walking away. As David follows downstairs, he observes the front door open and close, as if the man has walked out.David looks at the computer screen to play back what was captured. He shows Iris the figure of a headless man walking downstairs. He asks who it is, but she doesnt remember. She insists on going outside but he prevents her, telling her it is more important to allow him to hypnotize her so she can remember who it is.He hypnotizes her with a swinging watch. When he asks her who the attacker is, she refuses to say, citing too much pain. He tells her to open her eyes and look at the pain. At this point she relives the rape and he is forced to bring her out of the trance.Back at Homers place David asks for an envelope from the mail. He finds Homer going through the contents (deeds and ownership records). Homer finally hands him the envelope and tells him its a small community and they all like to know whats going on with everyone. He tells David the original owners of the house were two spinster sisters who died there. He blames Iris for the troubles that came a year after she moved in. He tells David the man found in the car which crashed into the tree (the same car Zack saw in Iriss driveway ten minutes earlier) could not be identified because the head was missing (which presumably fell into the river). Homer jokingly warns David he could be next. When David asks for a plumbers snake to fix the water pump, he gets no response from Homer. Turning to leave, David is struck in the face by the door, opened by Zack (who utters  whoops ).Back at the house Iris is dressing Davids wound in the bathroom when a prescription vial falls out of the medicine chest. He picks it up, noticing it is for Iris from a Dr. Kathleen Thorpe (Ruth Manning). He tells Iris he wants to bring in a trans-medium to contact the spirit. She says no, that she doesnt want anyone to know.  Know what?  he presses. At this point another high-pitched scream is heard and David goes to examine his equipment. He and Iris observe a glowing light coming from the attic.In the attic, David watches as an antique baby buggy rolls around and a stuffed animal floats in the air. A womans nightgown is lifted and torn in half. David places his hand on the source of the light, which goes out.He is seen going through documents from a box found in the attic. There is a record of a child on one of them. Iris faints and we see the bottle of pills in her hand, now empty.Dr. Thorpe comes out of the examining room at the hospital where David is waiting and tells him they had to pump a dozen diazepam (Valium) from her stomach. Recognizing that she treated Iris before, he asks about the Valium prescribed. Dr. Thorpe says it was after the rape. David says he is from the adoption agency and wants to know the name of the father. She says she doesnt know and isnt surprised that Iris wont tell anyone. David gets on the phone to Darla, asking her to find the records on the child put up for adoption and all the details. Zack is seen coming in with flowers for Iris, but after overhearing the conversation on the pay phone, he disgustedly throws the flowers into the trash and leaves.Zack is seen belly-aching to Homer about the guy moving in on his girl (Iris). Homer advises him to fix the water pump, saying it might give him an advantage with her. Taking the advice, he steps up over the bar and retrieves two six-packs of beer, saying he will head out to Iriss house.Later that afternoon at the house, Iris is stoking wood into the fireplace and hears a car pull up. David is studying the imaging equipment on his computer of the headless man. She calls him and they go outside to see Dr. Carl Farnsworth arriving. David tells her that he was already on his way. He introduces himself to Iris. She tells him he came for nothing and that she is not going anywhere. David explains that Iris is staying at home. David hints that Carl needs to stay overnight since it is so late (winking at Carl, who follows his lead). Reluctantly Iris says he can stay for the night and David shows him to his room.Telling Carl they should begin after Iris is asleep so as not to upset her, Carl asks how long he has been interested in her. Meanwhile a drunken Zack is seen working on an exposed pipe near the house and talking as if to Iris. He looks into the end of the pipe to see if he can find what is blocking it.Carl sits down in an easy chair while David fixes drinks. Iris comes in with a tray of coffee, and seeing Carl sitting there, suggests he not sit there. Suddenly there is a knock on the door. David goes to answer it. It is Darla, who enters. She introduces herself to Iris, saying she is Davids personal assistant,  the wild woman behind the man, so to speak.  She introduces herself to Carl while Iris demands to know what is going on. Darla says a fourth person is needed for a séance. David tells Iris they were going to wait until after she was asleep. She sarcastically thanks him. Darla produces a large envelope of documents from the adoption agency, telling them she obtained it by pretending to be Iris. Visibly upset and citing confidentiality, Iris demands they all leave. Carl insists they dont need the papers, saying they will find out directly from the spirit.As the séance begins, Carl tells them to not break the concentration no matter what happens. Iris is seen having drunk a glass of wine. Carl reveals a syringe of Thorazine, telling them to give it to him if the spirit wont let him go. He sips from a glass of water and begins the ceremony, calling to the spirit haunting Iris. After a moment unearthly sounds are heard. He asks David to continue. David repeats the call, after which the clock stops and more sounds are heard. From the fireplace the headless ghost appears and walks around the table, finally settling into Carl. Iris demands they stop. Carl, possessed by the spirit, begins writing on a sheet of paper. David tells Darla to read what it says by holding up a mirror. The backwards writing is then seen:  Iris . Iris gasps as a voice calls her name. David asks what his name is and is told  Kurt  and then the last name  Norwood . David asks if he is the husband of Iris and he laughs. Iris says  no, hes not my husband. Hes nothing to me-disgusting.  She addresses the spirit, demanding to know where  it  is. He replies that she knows because she killed it. David attempts to restrain Iris and the spirit (in Carls body) approaches and hurls David to the side. Darla is called upon to give Carl the shot. She tries but is tossed aside, the syringe falling to the floor. Meanwhile the spirit is choking Iris. David grabs the syringe and gives Carl the shot. He is thrown back again, but this causes the spirit to leave the body of Carl. It walks back into the fireplace and vanishes.David is seen talking to Darla who is in the front seat of an ambulance, asking for extra credit. Paramedics bring out Carl on a stretcher and Iris apologizes to him. He says he never takes it personally. He cautions David to take Iris away but she says she cant leave and runs inside. David asks what to do if he cant get Iris to leave and is told the malevolent spirit will destroy everyone unless he can find the head before Kurt does.Meanwhile Zack, having gotten his hands on the obstruction in the pipe, pulls it out, only to scream as it is revealed to be the missing head.David comes in where Iris is sadly reading documents brought from the adoption agency. He reads from one which states that the child died. Iris says it was not a natural death but that she (stops talking). David replies that she couldnt have killed her own baby. She says that he couldnt know what people would do. Her father came in every night since her mother died and molested her and raped her. She shows him her scars from resisting her fathers advances. He continued to follow her after she left home, finding her more than once. He claimed to have changed and wanted them to be a family again, but there were too many bad memories.Recalling the night the baby was born, Iris is seen in labor. Kurt is seen sitting in his favorite chair, reading his favorite book and listening to his favorite song until the child is born. He comes into the bedroom with the meat cleaver and hacks down by the child. She tells David that in the struggle she rolled over on the baby to protect it but blacked out. When she came to, the baby was gone. She struggled to go outside where her father came up with a shovel, saying he buried it. He told her she had smothered it to death so he didnt have to kill it. She struck him with the shovel and drove with him in the car, going to the sheriffs office. When he came to and began attacking her, she bailed out of the car just before it struck a tree.Zack is seen at his truck but hears a noise and goes to investigate. Meanwhile David tells Iris that the spirit will re-enact the crime as he has every night at midnight. They wait outside the door until the spirit comes out carrying the crying baby. She calls out that the baby is still alive at that point. David shushes her. They follow him down close to Millers Bridge where he is seen burying the baby. She cries out that he buried it alive, but again she is restrained by David. Zack is seen carrying the head wrapped in a cloth.Iris chases after her father and tries to tackle him, but is unable to touch the spirit. David digs at the spot where the child was buried. Meanwhile Zack sees the crashed car and looks inside, seeing no one. As he turns around, the headless spirit is seen. Shocked, Zack drops the head, which immediately begins to re-attach itself to the body. Now appearing as a ghoul, Kurt grabs the head of Zack and twists it off, laughing fiendishly.After digging some more, David shows Iris the body of her son Brian (not shown). Suddenly Kurt appears and attacks David, throwing him aside. He tells Iris that he has come for Brian. She cries no, telling David that he wont stop until he has the remains of the child. Suddenly a light shines from the grave and David and Iris both call upon the innocent spirit of Brian Norwood. A struggle ensues between this light and Kurt, finally resulting in a total explosion of the ghouls body. Iris removes the remains from the grave and wraps them up. David tells her that they will bury him in consecrated ground.Iris is seen laying flowers on the grave of Brian with David. They embrace.That night they are seen in bed together. At midnight, Iris hears something. David tells her that everyone is at peace and that it is just the wind. They lie back to sleep. Iris awakes and takes out a flashlight, looking around. When she looks under the bed, Kurt is seen calling her name. She screams but wakes up from a dream. He reassures her it was just a bad dream. She insists they look under the bed. When they both look, they see nothing. He tells her it is over and they kiss. David looks over at the clock and sees the sequence beginning again at midnight."

Penn however sends Teller away to presumably spend some alone time with the female police officer. A dejected Teller wonders around Atlantic City alone. He goes to a theater and watches a collection of the Three Stooges best comic segments. He spots the mysterious stalker who shot Penn earlier and attempts to follow him, but the stalker gets away again. Teller then purchases a gun at a local pawn shop for defense against Teller. While walking under the AC boardwalk, Teller gets mugged by two street gang members, but does not use the gun, instead hoping to find the man stalking Penn.Teller returns to the boat the next morning where Officer MacNamara announces that a nameless villain, a supposed vehement Penn & Teller fan (David Patrick Kelly) who dresses and acts like Penn, has been arrested. Penn and Teller get to tour his bizarre apartment which has been turned Penn & Teller shrine. Teller innocuously disposes of his gun in a trashcan of the apartment. Shortly after MacNamara departs, Penn is stabbed in the stomach by an assailant on the street. Penn rushes off to hospital where, once Teller is out of sight, he appears perfectly fine. Teller proceeds to pursue the would-be assassin in a peculiar chase scene back to the apartment.The madman, dressed as Penn, forces Teller to enact a Penn & Teller routine with him, hanging in gravity boots in front of a camera. He then uses duct tape to secure the hapless Teller to the gravity boot rig. Officer MacNamara returns and reveals that she and the assasin have been working together to kill both Penn and Teller. The assassin leaves the apartment to finish off Penn while the dirty police woman stays behind to look after the captive Teller. MacNamara confesses to Teller her contempt of Penn & Teller. The confused Teller is able to grab the gun from the wastebasket and threatens MacNamara with it as the real Penn walks into the apartment. Teller shoots and kills him with one shot.MacNamara laughs, thinking that it's a new joke. She then reveals herself as Carlotta complete with a fake wig, teeth, and contact lenses. The implications of what have just happened suddenly catch up with them: The whole event of the stalker had been a joke on Teller who turned everything around on the players. Speaking for the first time, Teller immediately thinks they switched the gun for a replica, but then realizes that he just shot his partner. Teller turns the gun on himself. Carlotta, stricken with grief, throws herself out the window.Upon returning to his apartment and finding everyone dead, the ""hired assassin"" shoots himself. Two police officers, responding to reports of shots from one of the apartments enter and unable to stand the sight, shoot themselves. Others who come into the apartment and find the carnage shoot themselves. The film ends with a pull-out from the apartment building with a view of Atlantic City, as more gunshots fire in the distance, while the Bee Gees song ""I Started a Joke"" plays in the background."

When she gets too close, the hands grab Dazzle and choke her to death.During the night, Something Else sneaks into the apartment and whispers for Dazzle to wake up. The next morning, Cassandra comes downstairs to find Dazzle dead and Shady covered with blood. She slaps Shady awake and confesses she drugged her. Shady is too dazed to understand, and Cassandra telephones Decker. However, she is interrupted by Ike, carrying a razor blade. He demands Cassandra hang up as he will protect Shady. Cassandra hugs him, saying she understands how lonely he must be, then slips a razor blade from inside her mouth, clutches it in her teeth and slits the man's throat. She catches some of Ike's blood in a cup, and force feeds it to Shady.At the police station, Decker discovers that Cassandra is not English, but a New York City prostitute who murdered her pimp with a razor blade hidden in her mouth. Tests reveal the pill he found was a compound used by the U. S. Army in Vietnam to brainwash prisoners, and Cassandra's pimp was in the U.S. Army as an interrogator.Cassandra poses Shady on the couch and tells the drugged girl she loves her. She became jealous when Shady befriended the other strippers. Casandra whispers into Shady's ear causing her to dream she is at the strip club dressed as a little girl playing with her dolls. A figure in black veils floats towards her, holding a razor blade between her teeth. Cassandra produces a razor from her mouth and lightly cuts Shady's lip. Decker appears with his gun drawn, but does not see Cassandra retract the blade in her mouth. Dropping her phony British accent, Cassandra walks towards Decker pretending to be unarmed, but pops out the blade and slashes his hand, causing Decker to fall backward through a glass table. As he scurries to retrieve his dropped pistol, a shard from the table slashes a rope holding the skylight shut. It opens and ""Something Else's"" dead body falls on him. In Shady's dream, she unmasks the veiled figure to find Cassandra. Shady wakes up, sees Cassandra stab Decker in the shoulder with a piece of broken glass, picks up the gun and pumps bullets into Cassandra, finally killing her before hugging the wounded and bleeding Decker."

Master checks out the nunnery but finds no bats. However, he does find a locked meditation room with garlic hanging from the ceiling and the remains of a priest who disappeared, along with a second priest, many years ago.The next day, Master returns to supervise the digging of a new well for the village.

Mindfield,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097886/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a police detective kills a criminal, this traumatic event triggers a locked memory, he didn't know he had, of him being a subject of a CIA experiment. The movie starts with text from a New York Times article about Project MKUltra. Mind control experiments were funded by the CIA and many used LSD. Many of these experiments were conducted to make people kill without leaving a trace of evidence.It is Christmastime in Montréal. Montréal police detective Kellen O'Reilly is on his way to meet his ex-wife for coffee at a diner atop Olympic Stadium and hand over his divorce papers. At the same time, mob hitman Rudy Myers and his gang, which consists of Alabama Bill, Mick and Eddie, are visiting accountant Leo Sloukos to conduct a shady business deal. Back at the diner, Kellen tells his ex-wife that the police department is facing a possible strike and that he's overworked due to him organizing the strike. At Leo's office, Leo tells Rudy and his gang that he and attorney Bob Champlain got stiffed on a deal, but they obtained something very valuable. Despite the mention of the valuable artifact, Leo's carelessness and greed do not fare well with Rudy, who kills him and takes off with his gang.On his way back from the diner, Kellen starts to have flashbacks of him at a hospital and a mysterious doctor who tells him ""Remember that he killed your father."" Kellen is then seen at his psychiatrist's office. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mendel, is concerned about Kellen, who thinks that Kellen's flashbacks are caused by a number of things, including the police strike and his ex-wife's upcoming marriage. Kellen denies that those events are the reasons for his flashbacks. Dr. Mendel tells Kellen that it is time that the truth regarding his father's death be revealed, which Kellen insists on not hearing at the moment.At the local courthouse, civil attorney Sarah Paradis is at a hearing to represent the victims of mind control experiments that occurred many years ago. The mysterious doctor from Kellen's flashbacks, Dr. Gregor Satorius, who is being sued on account of the mind control experiments, shows no remorse for his victims. Sarah tells the judge that the CIA funded Dr. Satorius's clinic, The Coldhaven Institute and paid him to conduct the experiments. The case is then thrown out by the judge. Satorius, knowing that Sarah could destroy everything he's ""worked for"" and ruin his reputation, confronts Sarah and questions her motives. Sarah tells Satorius to just wait for when the trial takes place.Meanwhile, defense attorney Bob Champlain is about to leave his office for the day and tells his secretary to file his papers and mail something out. He then tries to come on to her by saying that he just received a big ""payment"" and he will be able to give her a Christmas bonus. She ignores his advances.At the strike meeting, tensions are high as everyone is debating as to whether or not the strike should be carried on. Things get even worse when Kellen makes highly inappropriate and sexist comments towards Sarah and begins to have flashbacks again. This angers Sarah. After the meeting as everyone else is headed home, Kellen notices that Sarah is having problems with her car. Kellen then decides to help her and Kellen apologizes to Sarah for what happened during the meeting. Sarah accepts his apology and offers him a ride home, which Kellen accepts. On their way, Sarah stops by a nearby pharmacy to refill a prescription.At the same time, Bob Champlain is walking inside the same pharmacy to purchase nose spray for his cold. He is unaware that he is being trailed by Rudy and his gang. Just as Sarah is getting her prescription refilled, Rudy and his gang, sporting guns and ski masks hold up the entire pharmacy. Meanwhile, Kellen needs cigarettes and two cops walking by tell him that he is right in front of the pharmacy. Upon walking inside, Kellen intrudes on the robbery and when he is told to stay right where he is, he then starts to have another series of flashbacks. This causes him to go into action and he shoots Bill. Rudy then tells Kellen that he will kill all of the hostages. Kellen allows Rudy and his gang to only take one hostage. They then take a scared Champlain outside to find out where he is hiding a key. Champlain now recognizes Rudy and Rudy reveals to Champlain about Leo's death. Rudy tells Mick to shoot Champlain in the mouth. As Rudy begs for his life and mentions how his key is in his safe and is the only one who can open it, Mick immediately shoots him the mouth. The cops arrive as soon as Kellen discovers the body.The next morning at the police station, Kellen talks to Eugene Borko, his captain, about the robbery and how it was conducted by Rudy and his gang merely just to get to Champlain. Later on, Kellen and his partner, Raolo Basutti go to Champlain's office to ask his secretary for any details regarding the murder. They discover Champlain's safe, which was unlocked the entire time and find a stash of pornography and sex toys. They also discover a complimentary key chain from the sex shop Erotim.At Erotim, Kellen and Raolo visit with the store's gay manager Juley ""The Juice"", who is also a police informant, and the film's comic relief, to ask about the death of Mr. Champlain. Eddie is also present at the store as well. Kellan and Raolo learn that Bob Champlain was a regular at the store and mentions that a key chain can be obtained when a purchase of $50 or more is made. Juley also mentions to Kellan and Raolo information about Champlain's connection to local mobster Johnny Ronce and that Rudy Myers is from the United States and was indeed responsible for the death of Champlain.Later that night, Kellan and Sarah are at a restaurant on a date. Sarah notices a poster about the CIA taking over Chile and how ""your country could be next."" She declares to Kellan that she will bury Satorius to the ground if she has to. Afterwards, Kellan and Sarah arrive at the former's home and after settling down for a while, the two have sex, completely unaware that Eddie has been snooping around Kellan's home watching him. After their sex, Kellan mentions to Sarah that he felt an urge to kill during the robbery and tells her about his flashbacks of his days at Coldhaven. Later the next morning, Raolo arrives at Kellan's home with his wife Therese and his son Mario, since it is Raolo's day off as well as Kellan's. After some socializing, Kellan gets a call from Juley the Juice, which puts a halt to their day plan, much to Therese's dismay.At Erotim, Juley tells both Kellan and Raolo more information about Rudy as well as that Johnny Ronce sends any of his men who maybe hurt or injured to a small clinic run by a one Doctor Tom Luk, a former Saigon doctor. Afterwards, Raolo tells Therese that their day is no longer going to be able to go as planned, which enrages Therese as she yells at him for spending little time with his son.Raolo and Kellan go to Dr. Luk's clinic, but they notice that no one is present. As they approach the last room in the clinic, they notice that blood is dripping on the floor. The curtain is opened and it is revealed that Dr. Luk has supposedly committed suicide.At Johnny Ronce's health club, Johnny is relaxing in his hot tub, when a naked Kellan wanders into the hot tub and surprises Johnny. Johnny is surprised to see someone else in his jacuzzi, and his men are about to shoot Kellan, but Raolo steps in to keep control of the situation. Kellan tells Johnny that Dr. Luk is dead and was found hanged in his own clinic. Johnny denies that he knows Dr. Luk, but Kellan knows Johnny is lying and Johnny threatens to report Kellan. Johnny ultimately comes clean to Kellan about his connections to Rudy and Champlain and decides not to report Kellan.Later that night, Kellan and Sarah are at home setting up Christmas decorations. Sarah wants Kellan to testify against Satorius but Kellan is against it, knowing that he will get suspended from the police force if he does, as they do not take a kind approach towards workers with past mental health history. This enrages Sarah, as she throws a box of ornaments on the ground and storms out of Kellan's house.The next morning at the police station, Kellen and Raolo meet with Eugene and FBI Agent Hugh McVeigh. McVeigh mentions that Rudy is connected to the family DelGado which operates out of Miami, Florida and Eugene mentions that Kellan and Raolo no longer need to work on the case any longer, as it is being handed over to the FBI and R.C.M.P.Despite this however, Kellan and Raolo are still determined to solve the case themselves. They go to a bank and Kellan, posing as Bob Champlain, is able to get access to Champlain's safety deposit box, which has an old film reel. Kellan and Raolo's next stop is Erotim, to watch the film inside the store's theatre, much to Juley's dismay. While watching the film, Kellan notices a young Dr. Satorius conducting mind control experiments. One of his patients turns out to be none other than Kellen himself. Raolo becomes aware of Kellan's past at Coldhaven and shows his support for Kellan. They decide to take the film to their captain.This support does not last long however. As Kellan and Raolo are leaving Erotim, Rudy and his gang show up. Kellen notices that they have a gun pointed towards Raolo. Kellan tells Raolo to duck, which causes the car to trigger a car bomb set up by Rudy, killing Raolo in the process and presumably destroying the film as well. Mick searches an unconscious Kellan for the film, but Kellan hits Mick's head with a brick. Rudy and Kellan start shooting at each other and Mick ends up getting left behind as Rudy and Eddie take off. Mick is about to shoot Kellan himself, but Kellan tells him not to. Mick drops his gun, but quickly picks it up before being shot by Kellan. Kellan then goes to Raolo's house to bring the tragic news to Therese and Mario. Mario runs off as even though Kellan had not said anything, both Therese and Mario could tell from the look of Kellan's face that something horrible has happened to Raolo.Kellen is later at the police station, trying to convince Eugene about the film and that what he saw on the film is in fact real. Eugene does not buy it. Sergeant Lachance storms in on behalf of Raolo's death and that Kellan was still on a case he was no longer assigned to. Eugene and Lachance then tell Kellen that he has been under investigation and are aware of his psychological health and flashbacks. Kellen had lied about his medical history. He is then suspended and is required to turn his gun in.Back at his house, Kellen is drying himself off from a shower. He tells Sarah about what he saw on the film and that he is going back to Coldhaven to ""get his memory back."" Despite Sarah's pleas for him to not go, Kellen tells her to just back off and leave him alone. On his way to Coldhaven, Kellan stops at the apartment of local drug dealer Benny for Acid and L.S.D., presumably to make himself immune to Satorius' mind control treatment, should he use it on Kellan. Kellan is seen taking said drug not long after. Meanwhile, Sarah visits with Dr. Mendel, who tells Sarah that, when Kellan was nine years old, Kellen's father, also a Montréal police officer, had shot an unarmed man and that there was to be an inquiry. Kellen's father then shot himself in the head and that it was a young Kellen that found the body. Kellen, since his days at Coldhaven, had been in a state of denial about his father's death and had believed that his father was killed in the line of duty. Sarah mentions to Dr. Mendel about Satorius' mind control experiments linking L.S.D. with the mind, and Dr. Mendel mentions that whoever did conduct said experiments were totally irresponsible.At Coldhaven, Kellen sneaks into Dr. Satorius' office and logs onto his computer, which reveals a great number of detail about Satorius' former patients, including Kellen himself. At Kellen's home, Eddie, under the impression that Kellen still has the film, has completely trashed the home while prowling around again. Sarah later leaves a message on the machine saying that she found the film, and Eddie leaves the house.When Satorius walks into his office, Kellen confronts Dr. Satorius. Satorius reveals his intentions to Kellen as well as information that he helped Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty confess his crimes in 1949 by breaking his mental defense. Kellen tells Satorius that he only wants to change people for them to kill. Satorius reveals to Kellan the truth about his father's death. This causes Kellen to nearly kill Satorius by throwing a chair onto the doctor, but Kellen throws it at a mirror instead, which reveals that Rudy and Eddie were listening in on Kellen and Satorius' confrontation the entire time. Kellen is knocked unconcious. Rudy finds out that Satorius had lied to Rudy and did not get rid of any evidence like he was told to and that the world must never know of what really happened at Coldhaven. Rudy, Eddie and Satorius are then seen trying to wipe Kellen's memory clean of what he found out. Because of Satorius' double cross, Satorius himself is also wiped clean of his memory. Rudy and Eddie decide to make it look like Kellen had killed Satorius and then himself. As Eddie is adjusting Kellen, Kellen headbutts Eddie and takes off for Olympic Stadium, where the police strike is taking place. Sarah is present there.At the stadium, after a speech from Therese regarding her husband's death, the strike is made official. Sarah is then kidnapped by Rudy, who threatens to kill her if she tries to call for help. Mario witnesses the kidnapping. Mario then sees Kellen running on his way to save Sarah. Mario tells Kellen about Sarah's kidnapping and they move on to the arena. Mario is later seen alerting the Union Rep. The Rep then calls for anyone who has a gun to go to the arena, where Sarah his being held. At the arena, Rudy is interrogating Sarah about the film, when McVeigh shows up and tries to disarm Rudy and tells Sarah to run. McVeigh tells Rudy that the CIA no longer kills the indiscriminate and Rudy says that Project 47 sprung a leak and it's his job to fix it. McVeigh then tells Rudy his theory about the possibility of other people besides Kellen being seen in the film, quite possibly Lee Harvey Oswald. Eddie then shoots McVeigh and Rudy takes Sarah hostage by gunpoint. Eddie and Rudy notice the number of police arriving into the stadium. Eddie is shot by Kellen and falls to his death. The stadium power is then cut off by orders of the Union Rep and Rudy threatens to kill Sarah if his demands are not met. Kellen then hands the film to Rudy in exchange for Sarah, and Sarah is set free. Rudy is then promptly shot by the police. As Kellen looks upon Rudy's corpse, he starts to have another flashback, but then walks away.Back at Coldhaven, Satorius' computer is still on. The camera moves slowly downward and shows on the screen that Lee Harvey Oswald was one of Satorius' patients and was in fact, accepted into the fifth phase of Satorius's experiments. The building's janitor then walks in and unplugs the computer to plug in his vacuum, wiping out all of Satorius's data. Rudy got his wish posthumously!"

Heartstopper,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095285/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A physician who was hanged during the American Revolution for being a vampire is resurrected. He confesses his crimes to a priest, but starts to kill again. His modern descendant turns out to be a serial killer who also wants to be a vampire.—frankfob2@yahoo.com Because of his research into the nature of blood and the cure of diseases of the blood, Benjamin Latham, medical doctor and Tory, was hanged as a vampire and Satanist in 1776 at Old Fort Pitt in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania after being convicted because of bogus testimony given by Patience Latham, the wife of Benjamin's brother Jacob, who claimed to have seen him drinking blood that he took from his patients. To prevent Benjamin from rising again, a stake was driven through his heart, garlic wrapped around his neck, his hands shackled, and his body secretly buried at a crossroads. But Benjamin didn't stay dead.Pittsburgh today. When little Stephanie Cayman is found dead in a sandbox, the coroner suspects from the swelling on her finger that she was either bitten by a venomous snake or she cut her finger on something poisonous. Lieutenant Ron Vargas finds a piece of glass in the sand but suspects murder because the girl's mother saw someone sitting in the sandbox with Stephanie just minutes before she died. The autopsy reveals that Stephanie was indeed poisoned by something both neurotoxic and hemotoxic. It caused her blood to coagulate, the coroner explains, and when the heart kept trying to circulate the clotted blood, it literally exploded. Further tests on the finger discover that the toxin was introduced through the cut on her finger when someone human, not a snake nor Stephanie, licked the wound. The toxin was in the licker's saliva.Along the banks of the Ohio River, Benjamin Latham comes upon four hoods harassing a group of sunbathers. Benjamin orders the hoods to stop. When they don't, he knocks out one of them and is then chased by the other three. One of the hoods, Elijah Alfred, follows Benjamin to the roof of a parking garage, where Benjamin finally decides that he's done playing. He easily lifts Elijah by his collar and tosses him onto the hood of a car. Then he slits Elijah's wrist and laps up his blood.Because he was a Catholic in his colonial days, Benjamin seeks help from Father Ed. Benjamin confesses how he was condemned and hanged but recently awoke when his coffin was unearthed by a large bulldozer. Naked and surprised, he managed to get out of the way in time, he says, along with his medicine box that had been buried with him. He tells how he found some clothes to put on then wandered into the yard where Stephanie was playing in her sandbox. When she cut herself on a piece of glass, he couldn't stop himself from sucking the blood from the wound until he noticed that Stephanie was dead and realized what he had done. ""Superstition has created a vampire,"" he concludes. Father Ed thinks it may just be a case of amnesia following trauma and that Benjamin probably hasn't killed anyone.Elijah's body has shown up in the coroner's office. Coroner Nick has an electrophoresis run on the man's slit wrist and finds saliva in the wound that matches that of the saliva found on Stephanie's cut. The conclusion: someone with poisonous saliva is killing people and sucking their blood. By that evening, news of the ""Vampire Killer"" is all over the television. That night, Sally Minton is attacked by a masked man as she returns home from babysitting. The man ties her up, rapes her, and drinks her blood. When Sally's body shows up at the coroner's office, however, the electrophoresis shows that the saliva in her wounds was not toxic and that the blood type does not match that of the original vampire killer. The coroner thinks it's a copycat killer, but Vargo disagrees. ""This one is also a necrophiliac,"" he adds.Early the next day, Benjamin visits the Fort Pitt Museum, but it isn't open yet. As he is waiting outside, he is approached by an antique dealer who is interested in the medicine box that Benjamin is carrying. The two get to talking, exchange names, and find that they are both Lathams. Matthew remembers being told that one of his ancestral uncles was Benjamin Latham, a doctor in colonial Pittsburgh, so Benjamin concocts a story about being from England and that the medicine box is a family hierloom. They go to Matthew's shop, where Matthew anxiously examines the box, noting that the box and everything in it is in perfect condition save for a missing fleem (blood-letting tool) and offers Benjamin $1,000 for the box. Benjamin agrees to sell the box, but he refuses to sell the fleem.Benjamin returns to the museum where he has a run-in with a photographer when he fails to move out of her camera shot, having never seen a camera before. He apologizes to her, and she apologizes for snapping at him. She introduces herself as Lenora Clayton and explains that she's working on a book about colonial Pittsburgh. Lenora ends up taking Benjamin home with her. The next time Benjamin goes to see Father Ed, he confesses that he and Lenora are living together. Even worse, he thinks that Lenora is becoming like him and that she, too, will eventually develop the craving for blood. Father Ed responds by thanking Benjamin for restoring his faith in the supernatural and, thus, in God's existence.Meanwhile, Elijah's three friends -- Jorell Jordan, Garth Weir, and Paul 'Mountain' Hill -- have been tailing Benjamin, looking to exact revenge on him for killing Elijah. First, however, they want to find out what they can from Father Ed. When the priest goes out to the parish cemetery to smoke a cigarette, the three hoods confront him. Unfortunately, Mountain gets out of control and stabs the priest in the guts. Benjamin and Lenora, who just happen to be passing by the cemetery, see the attack. When Benjamin stabs Mountain in the abdomen, the other two take off. As Lenora rushes to Father Ed's side, Benjamin goes after Jorell and Garth, but they get away. With his dying breath, Father Ed offers his blood to Benjamin, but Benjamin refuses. Not from a friend, he says, only from enemies, and he slits Mountain's arm and laps up his blood while Lenora watches.Lenora now knows what Benjamin is, but she doesn't care. Benjamin decides to focus attention on his descendent, Matthew Latham, whom he suspects of having an evil side. He takes to following Matthew and his current girlfriend Janice. When Matthew attacks Janice and she retaliates with Mace and a .22 bullet to his abdomen, Benjamin picks up Janice's dropped gun and contemplates finishing the job. Instead, out of a sense of family, he takes Matthew home and, using his surgical skills and Lenora's help, he extracts the bullet. Matthew survives the extraction and reveals to Benjamin that he wants to be like him...a vampire. We're both predators, he rationalizes, because we both take what we need from others and leave them dead. He begs Benjamin to turn him, but Benjamin refuses on the grounds that it would be incestuous and that their blood would probably poison each other. Matthew suggests that Benjamin could turn Lenora and then Lenora could turn him, but Benjamin again refuses. When Benjamin goes out hunting for a bite, Matthew sharpens the long end of a cross to fashion a stake and waits for Benjamin to return.Benjamin instinctively knows where to find Jorell parked outside of Applebee's, so he hides in the back seat of Jorell's car. When Jorell gets in the front seat and prepares to drive away, Benjamin strangles him and drinks his blood. What Benjamin doesn't know is that Lt Vargo was also tailing Jorell. When Vargo sees Benjamin exit Jorell's car, he chases after him. Benjamin runs home, where Matthew tries to drive the stake through his heart, hoping that Benjamin's powers will pass into him, but Benjamin easily knocks Matthew to his feet. Vargo enters the house and tries to shoot Benjamin, but Benjamin is able to overpower Vargo, too. While Vargo is down, Benjamin runs out the door. Vargo follows Benjamin onto a bridge and manages to shoot him in the chest. With another shot, Vargo shoots off Benjamin's left arm. A third shot hits him in the middle of the forehead, and Benjamin falls off the bridge into the dark water below.The strangeness of the vampire killings leads the local TV station to intervew Doctor Harrison Lubbock, a self-acclaimed vampire specialist. Lubbock admits to knowing of 27 vampires but refuses to say whether any of them have killed humans for their blood, as that constitutes privileged information. As Lubbock explains how vampires can regenerate new limbs like a starfish and how their wounds heal like putty in a hole, Benjamin can be seen walking out of the water, his left arm missing, a large wound in his chest, and the back of his head blown off. He falls to the ground and, while Lubbock goes on about vampires being superior to mortal humans, Benjamin's wounds start to close and he starts growing a new arm.Meanwhile, Matthew has convinced Lenora to turn him into a vampire. To transform properly, it must be done in a cemetery, she tells him. She leads him to a large gravestone, then makes him kneel before it. She stands behind him to say a prayer to Satan and to point a ""secret metallic talisman"" at the back of his head. Then she fires the .22, transforming Matthew from a living being to a dead one. As Benjamin steps out from behind a tree, Lenora uses the fleem to poke a hole in Matthew's wrist. She sucks up the blood, then joins Benjamin. They walk off together, hand in hand, as Benjamin assures her that there are many more evil people out there and that they will be providing a service to mankind by preying on them together.

Divoka srdce,1989,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097213/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The historical film consists of two shorts - The Dirty Shot and The Wild Peacock. They share a common theme in the famous duels between two important historical figures, Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin and Giovanni Giacomo Casanova. Pushkin's tragic duel, which prematurely ended his life, is portrayed in connection with the creation of his short story ""The Dirty Shot"", while Casanova's story is conceived in a rather ironic and humorous way. The point is that the famous seducer never actually seduced, on the contrary, all his life he was in a constant battle with female seductions. That is why he was so outraged by Mozart's opera Don Giovanni, supposedly partly inspired by his fate, and clashed with the author at the Dushkovs' house in Bertramka. The story of the real duel he fought with the Polish Marshal Branicki is a mere episode in the mosaic of his rich life.—EuroFan"

When Ho returns to his VC base, Khoi (Jim Ishida), a political officer, demands Ho give him the Thompson sub-machine gun he captured. When Ho refuses, Khoi demands that their commander, Captain Tuong (Haing S. Ngor), force Ho to give up the gun. However, Tuong rules that as Ho is a front line soldier, he should keep it. Khoi claims Tuong is questioning his courage and threatens to contact the Party about being insulted. Tuong denies insulting the man, and gives Khoi a mission with Ho.A few days later, Ho and Khoi stop a bus to search for a traitor. Upon boarding, Khoi finds a businessman wearing a cross. He orders the man off the bus, makes him kneel and asks if he wishes to pray. Before the man can say three words, Khoi shoots him dead, then riddles the bus with machine gun fire, which disturbs Ho.Meanwhile, Keene and his men return to their fire base with prisoners. Keene is in his tent when he hears screams and rushes out to find Captain Dirk has shot one prisoner and is drowning another. Keene orders him to stop, but Dirk argues that as they are in Vietnam, and he is Vietnamese, the prisoners belong to him. Keene suggests Dirk ""grow a pair"" and goes into the bush to capture his own prisoner. To maintain ""face,"" Dirk shoots the prisoner in the head and tells Keene to keep him.A jeep arrives at the fire base with Khan Li (Iilana B'tiste), a beautiful Vietnamese actress who is in charge of spreading pro-South Vietnamese propaganda to area farmers. Her bodyguard, Jacques (Johnny Hallyday), a former French Foreign Legionnaire, warns Keene that Dirk is a dangerous man.That night, Ho bunks down with his best friend, Pham, and discusses the reasons they joined the Viet Cong. Pham joined because American soldiers destroyed his village, while Ho wanted to get revenge against the South Vietnamese soldiers who massacred his family. Ho confesses he fears he is losing his soul due to the killings he has done.A few later, Capt. Keene receives orders to take Minh Tang, a village in ""The Iron Triangle."" He suggests Dirk and his men take the lead, but Dirk refuses stating that his superiors would not approve. The Viet Cong also want Minh Tang, so Tuong, Ho and Pham disguise themselves as peasant farmers and infiltrate the village. There, they attend a meeting run by Khan Li, who offers land grants to any villager willing to support the South Vietnamese government. An old man named Thuy (Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad) protests, denouncing the government for commandeering the villagers' entire rice crop. Khan Ly thanks him and tells everyone that speaking one's mind is important for democracy. After the meeting, Colonel Tuong orders Ho to assassinate Khan Ly. Ho meets a farmer's daughter and confesses to killing a woman that bothers him.That night, Jacques, Khan Ly's mercenary, murders the old man Thuy, then goes to a French colonial mansion to make love to Ly. When they finish, Li takes a shower, and Ho emerges from behind a curtain and garrotes Jacques. When a naked Khan Ly returns to the room and finds Ho, she attempts to seduce him to get him to spare her life. Ho first embraces her, then stabs her to death with a bayonet.The next day, Khoi, Ho and a squad of Viet Cong ambush Keene and his men. During the firefight, Keene takes aim at Ho, but the boy trips and falls, losing his weapon. Keene holds his fire, but is struck in the head by a rifle butt and taken prisoner. After the American squad is wiped out, Keene and two other captured American soldiers are marched into the jungle, but when one of the soldiers cannot keep up, Khoi shoots him dead. Keene tries to intervene and is seriously beaten until Ho calls off his attackers. Khoi screams he is in charge and to prove it shoots the other American in the head. For days they march north, and Keene is caned, starved and deprived of sleep in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to divulge his mission.One night, Ho gives Keene a bowl of rice and asks him why he did not shoot him during the battle. Before Keene can respond, Khoi arrives, kicks the rice bowl from Keene's hands and announces that Ho will pay for disobedience. Ho asks Pham to run ahead to report Khoi's conduct to Tuong. After Pham leaves, Ho drags Keene into the jungle, determined to keep the American alive until he can get him to Tuong. As Ho and Keene rush across country, they encounter a column of refugees who proclaim Ho as a hero and give him a lotus flower. Later, they meet a grandfather who claims his grandson was slain by the Viet Cong, dragging the dead body of the child in a burlap bag.That night over a campfire, Ho and Keene learn about each other's lives and politics. Ho explains his people fought to free their land from the French and cannot understand why the Americans invaded. Keene has no answer. The next day, they come upon a swift moving river. When Keene complains he cannot swim with his hands tied, Ho pushes him in. Screaming, Keene is shocked to discover that he has landed on a bridge submerged inches below the surface to prevent it from being spotted by American planes. Later, Ho unties Keene and gives him a bayonet so he can cut bamboo and suck out the juices.Khoi appears with three Viet Cong soldiers. He demands Keene be returned to him. When Ho resists, Khoi removes Pham's head from a burlap bag. They are interrupted when two American helicopters fly overhead. Realizing Keene was scouting for a major offensive, Khoi orders his men to warn Tuong. As they leave, Khoi offers to forgive Ho's impudence if he kills Keene. When Ho hesitates, Khoi rushes the American. Keene, who still has the bayonet, stabs Khoi, grabs his gun and turns on Ho. The two men stare at each other before Ho lowers his rifle and disappears into the jungle. Keene waves down a helicopter and joins the U.S. troops in attacking Minh Tang.A climatic battle begins as US helicopters land troops which assault the Viet Cong village. The battle is long and brutal and the village is more or less destroyed. As the Viet Cong retreat into the jungle before the Americans' superior firepower, Dirk appears and orders his men to kill the remaining villagers. Dirk starts by shooting the farmer's daughter who talked to Ho days earlier. As he bends down to examine the girl's body, a grenade rolls out of her dead hand and explodes, killing Dirk.Ho mans a machine gun, allowing Colonel Tuong and the rest of his compatriots to escape into the jungle. He is wounded by a mortar round, crawls into the bush, and takes out a grenade. U.S. soldiers quickly surround him, but before they can shoot, Keene arrives and orders everyone to hold their fire. Keene crawls over to Ho and gently takes the grenade away. After the medics remove Ho from the scene, Keene finds his diary and pockets it.Later in the final scene, Keene reads the boy's journal and discovers his enemy is very much like him."

With only harmless paint bullets as their weapons, they must match their skills against live ammunition and the ruthless men behind it.—Amanda Lowe <daro@meditnet.com> A group of weekend warriors practicing for the Power Commando paintball championship tournament, are isolated in a forest known as ""Zone 14"" or ""Sacred Land"", and could be killed by the locals of the forest. The forest was thought to have been completely sealed off. State Police Inspector King tries to arrange with the Governor a deal to get a rescue chopper and a task force squad, but the Governor refuses to comply. There are urban legends about Sacred Land such as ghosts haunting the land (as it is sacred Indian ground) and a story about a group of boy scouts that camped out there long ago, and all of them were found dead and without any eyes. King tells the Governor that the rescue team will arrive at Zone 14 before dark, but he will not take responsibility if the mission fails.Meanwhile, one of the young Commandos, Kiddie, has injured her leg and she is brought back to a cabin by her friend Flake and The Sarge, who has been providing camp for the Power Commando team. At the cabin, Kiddie tells the Sarge that she and Jeremy, her boyfriend and also part of the team, were laying down, relaxing, when out of nowhere, Kiddie's leg was then attacked by a booby trap.At the same time, Jeremy, Andy and Gino are rehearsing an ambush on their coach, Tattoo, and their guide, Mohawk. Tattoo scolds Jeremy and Gino for their recklessness, which could cost them big in the actual games. Jeremy says he did it all for Kiddie, whom Tattoo says isn't Jeremy's type since she's an uptown girl. Mohawk tells Tattoo that they should move on because the spirits could come after them. Tattoo is unmoved and becomes enraged by Mohawk's constant talk of the spirits, which scares Andy and causes him to run off. The 4 decide to go look for him.As the 4 men move along, Mohawk discovers Andy's body. Andy has been gutted like a fish. They then decide to go back to the cabin, but not before Mohawk radios the Sarge about Andy's death.Back at the cabin, Sarge, Kiddie and Flake overhear Mohawk mentioning Andy's death over the radio. Flake agrees to go out and get to the Sarge's Suburban to get help. While Flake is away, The Sarge goes insane due to a steel plate within his head and tries to take advantage of Kiddie and starts randomly shooting outside at various points in the film.While resting and after mourning Andy, Mohawk and Tattoo recount to Jeremy and Gino how Tattoo got his name. While fighting in Vietnam, one of Tattoo's fellow soldiers wrote ""Kiss V"" on Tattoo's lower back while sleeping. The tattoo on Tattoo's back stood for ""Kiss my ass."" Later that night, Jeremy, Tattoo, Mohawk and Gino are still heading back to the cabin. They see what looks to be one of the supposed spirits that Mohawk has been talking about and then hear shooting, which turns out to be from Sarge. Not too long after, Gino has been attacked by another trap and is near death when Tattoo threatens to kill Mohawk if Gino dies. Gino succumbs to his injury and ultimately dies.Meanwhile, Flake is out looking for the truck when she approaches a stream. She notices a 4x4 being hot-wired by unknown means. She then locates the truck.Jeremy then sees another supposed spirit walking through Sacred Land. Tattoo and Mohawk, carrying the bodies of Gino and Andy, quickly come to his aid. Tattoo notices a trap set up and throws a stick to test it. Jeremy is then stabbed through the leg by a spear in the ground (another trap), which leaves him immobilized in the process. Tattoo and Mohawk then decide they have no other choice but to use Jeremy as a decoy, in order to make it back to camp without being killed by whatever or whoever may be after them. While watching over Jeremy, Mohawk sees something or someone and proceeds to stand up, instantly getting shot in the back with an arrow. Tattoo has had enough. He calls for his invisible enemies to show themselves and is ultimately gunned down.While driving for help, Flake meets a blind man, who serves as her guide for a way out of Sacred Land. (""The one who comes back from Sacred Land is always going for help."") The blind man turns out to be one of the boy scouts who camped out on Sacred Land and lost their eyes years ago. Along the way, the blind man tells Flake that the Sheriff, who is one of the Sacred Land locals, is up on a corner not far from the exit. The blind man tells Flake to tell the Sheriff that she met up with a blind man who spoke of prophecy and doom.Flake meets with the Sheriff to ask for help for Kiddie, who is still in the Cabin with the Sarge on Sacred Land. The Sheriff tells Flake that he can't help her because Sacred Land is supposedly out of his area. She mentions to the Sheriff the blind man and the encounter with the 4x4, which was actually being hot-wired by Flexy, one of the locals. He offers Flake a ride, which she turns down. As she gets back into the truck, the blind man re-appears through the truck's back seat, almost scaring Flake.Back in the forest, three men come out of the darkness. Jeremy, who is still alive, albeit paralyzed, knows it's the end. Despite this, he makes an attempt to move as he sees the men approaching. One of the men approaches Jeremy and coldly slits his throat.The blind man tells Flake that the locals of Sacred Land are actually Pot Growers. The blind man then demands that he be let out. Flake refuses but the blind man says that while he's not one of the Sacred Land locals, the other locals, including the Sheriff still take care of him due to his lack of vision.Flake is then picked up by a local trooper who drives a van to meet with Inspector King, who was seen at the start of the film. King tells Flake that her friends are more than likely to be doomed. The locals of Sacred Land, who are Pot Growers, as stated by the blind man earlier, are highly trained and will do anything to deal with trespassers on Sacred Land. Not even the Army will try to stop them.Near the Cabin, the Sheriff and two locals are looking at the sky, noticing the approaching helicopter. One of the locals (Redhead) shows a grenade to the Sheriff, suggesting that they have a ""special plan.""As the chopper lands, Inspector King exits the chopper along with Flake, the Trooper and three marksmen. King greets the Sheriff, unaware that the Sheriff is one of the Sacred Land Pot Growers. Flake tries to convince King that the Sheriff is one of the locals, but the Sheriff dismisses this (""Blind man's bullshit!"") and tells King that a crazy man (actually the Sarge) is holding a girl (Kiddie) hostage. Flake tells King that the Sheriff is lying and that Sarge and Kiddie are her friends.King then yells at the Sarge through the loudspeaker to come out of the cabin. The Sarge comes out with his gun and is told to drop his weapon. The Sheriff fires his rifle into the air, causing the Sarge to start randomly shooting again, only to be shot by the marksmen. All three marksmen are then killed in gruesome ways. King and the Sheriff then point their guns at each other, with the Sheriff laughing manically. Redhead tosses a grenade into the cabin. Kiddie notices, but is unable to do anything about it because of her leg injury. As Flake and the Trooper run into the cabin to rescue Kiddie, they fail to notice the grenade that has been tossed into the cabin and the cabin subsequently explodes, instantly killing the three inside. King turns around and sees the cabin in flames. The helicopter has already proceeded to take off into the night. All is lost. Redhead declares victory. (""Visitors: 0. Locals: 12.""). The Sheriff congratulates the locals, including Flexy and Redhead. The Sheriff and the other locals then push King along to an unknown fate."
