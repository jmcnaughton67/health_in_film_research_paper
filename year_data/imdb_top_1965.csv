The Sound of Music,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young novice is sent by her convent in 1930s Austria to become a governess to the seven children of a widowed naval officer. In 1930s Austria, a young woman named Maria is failing miserably in her attempts to become a nun. When Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp writes to the abbey asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. His wife is dead, he is often away, and he runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that he keeps hiring and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws the children to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives, including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though he is already engaged to a Baroness named Elsa and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made. Their personal conflicts soon become overshadowed, however, by world events. Austria is about to come under Germany's control, and the Captain may soon find himself drafted into the German Navy and forced to fight against his own country.—LOTUS73 Maria always wanted to be a nun ever since she was a little girl, but when she grew up and joined them, she could not cope because of her wild and longing-to-be-free personality. She is, however, sent away to be the governess of seven children who give governesses a hard time and live with their widowed father who runs the house as he does his ship. Maria, however, succeeds in bringing happiness and music back to there. She and the Captain eventually start falling in love, but it can't work out due to some certain reasons.—Ropheka Adejugbe In 1930s Salzburg, Maria is a novice at a convent, she always having thought about being a nun growing up on the hills above town and being able to see above the convent walls to the goings-on inside when she was a child. The sisters, including the Mother Abbess, however openly muse about Maria's fitness as a nun, they not questioning her faith but rather her temperament, as she always seems to be getting into one form of trouble or another. As such, the Mother Abbess feels it best, against Maria's wishes, for her to leave the convent if only temporarily to see if distance will provide some clarity for all of them, Mother able to secure her a position as governess for wealthy widowed Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp's seven children, age range from sixteen year old Liesl to five year old Gretl. It is a difficult transition for Maria working under the extremely regimented mentality of the Captain who treats his children and her like they were in the military, especially since the passing of their mother, to dealing with the disruptive children who have gone through many governesses in they not wanting a governess but rather love from a present father and a mother. As Maria is able to soften the workings of the household, first with the children and then the Captain, the latter may see what the children need, namely a mother, he having chosen wealthy Vienna-based Baroness Elsa Schraeder. What he is unaware of is that while she wants to be Mrs. Captain Von Trapp and live the life of gaiety and wealth, the Baroness has no want to be a mother to the seven children. Complicating matters are, in no particular order, the Nazi takeover of Austria, the Captain ultra-Nationalistic who has no intention of working within the Nazi regime, and Maria and the Captain falling in love with each other, neither wanting to admit so both because of the Baroness and Maria's long and singular course of being a nun.—Huggo Maria had longed to be a nun since she was a young girl, yet when she became old enough, she discovered that it wasn't at all what she thought. Often in trouble and doing the wrong things, she is sent to the house of retired Naval Captain Georg von Trapp to care for his seven children. He was widowed several years before and was left to care for the children, who have run off countless governesses. Maria soon learns that all they need is a little love to change their attitudes. She teaches them to sing, and through her, music is brought back into the hearts and home of the Trapp family. Unknowingly, Maria and the Captain are falling helplessly in love, except there are two problems: he is engaged to a Baroness named Elsa and she is a postulant.—Katy Richardson The widowed, retired Austrian naval officer, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) has made his Austrian home one of overly restrictive and harshly enforced discipline, one that, most unintentionally, causes his seven children to be underfed when it comes to joy and love. Being a nun living in a convent is similarly restrictive and unfulfilling for Maria (Julie Andrews), who breaks rules to try to change it. The reverend mother (Peggy Wood) decides that Maria, who is not cutting it as a nun, should leave and take on a job as governess at the nearby Von Trapp household in Salzburg.Through music and various outings, Maria gives the children a taste of a more fulfilling, joyous, life than they have ever known, and they come to love her very dearly. The Captain grows closer to his children, too, coming to understand the value and beauty of the freedoms that Maria has given them. Ironically, the freedom of all Austrians to live their lives to the fullest is in danger, for it is 1938, and Germany is marching into Austria. The Captain is a patriot, passionate about the fulfilling life that Austria has always offered its citizens.In his personal life, the Captain is having a romance with a wealthy, cultivated, and lovely Baroness (Eleanor Parker), but he is becoming more and more captivated by Maria, and is falling in love with her, and she, too, feels growing affection for him. She is a nun, however, and unschooled in dealing with the situaiton. Frightened by the developments, Maria runs back to the convent, where the reverend mother convinces her that she must face, rather than run from, the situation, causing Maria to return to the Captain's home. It seems, though, that she is too late, learning that the Captain and the Baroness have become engaged.The Captain, who had surely concluded that he could never have Maria for a wife, confides to the Baroness that he loves Maria, but the Baroness admits she had sensed it long ago, and the engagement is called off. The Captain and Maria marry, but an ugly situation befronts them upon return from their honeymoon -- the Captain has been summoned, in a telegram, by the Third Reich to serve in its navy.Due to the Captain 's unwillingness to serve the Third Reich, the Captain and Maria resolve to leave Austria, and, after escaping the pursuit of some Nazi officers, they set out, with the children, for the mountains of Switzerland on foot."

During the Russian Revolution, Dr. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) is a young doctor who has been raised by his aunt and uncle following his father's suicide. Yuri falls in love with beautiful Lara Guishar (Julie Christie), who has been having an affair with her mother's lover, Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), an unscrupulous businessman. Yuri, however, ends up marrying his cousin, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin). But when he and Lara meet again years later, the spark of love reignites.—Jwelch5742 Lara (Julie Christie) inspires lechery in Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) (her mother's lover who is a master at surviving whoever runs Russia) and can't compete with passion for the revolution of the man she marries, Pasha (Sir Tom Courtenay). Her true love is Dr. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif), who also loves his wife. Lara is the one who inspires poetry. The story is narrated by Zhivago's half brother Yevgraf (Sir Alec Guinness), who has made his career in the Soviet Army. At the beginning of the movie, he is about to meet a young woman he believes may be the long lost daughter of Lara and Zhivago.—Dale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com> Set just before and in the years following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, the movie follows the life of Dr. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) as he marries, raises a family, has his life totally disrupted by World War I, and then by the Revolution.

Married to an upper-class girl who is devoted to him, yet in love with an unfortunate woman who becomes his muse, Zhivago is torn between fidelity and passion. Sympathetic with the revolution but shaken by the wars and purges, he struggles to retain his individualism as a humanist amidst the spirit of collectivism.—<dapao@hotvoice.com> A high ranking Russian General has arrived at an industrial project office. It is night and this man is there on personal business: He is looking for his niece. Somehow, in the past decade, he has managed to find her, or at least someone who appears to be the daughter of his half brother
.
The would-be niece is skeptical, and afraid. General Yevgraf Zhivago tells her the details of the life of his half brother as he knows it. This is the movie.Yuri Zhivago is a boy, only 8 years old, when his mother dies, somewhere in central Asia, not far from Mongolia. Yuri is adopted by very close friends of his mother, the Gromykos, an upper class family with a home in Moscow and a country estate near the Ural Mountains. The Gromykos have a daughter, Tonya, who is the same age as Yuri.Yuri, now a young man, becomes a doctor, preferring to see ""life"" in General Practice rather than be a researcher. He is also an accomplished and published poet. Late one winter evening, a lonely group of socialist demonstrators is slaughtered by a Czar Cavalry Unit. Yuri witnesses the entire event from his balcony and attempts to care for the wounded. He is forced back into his home by the soldiers. He is shaken by the event.The following winter, at a music recital, Yuri's mentor is summoned to treat a woman who has attempted suicide, possibly by drinking Iodine. Yuri accompanies his mentor and sees ""life"" first hand. It is at this woman's home where he first sees Lara, the daughter of the woman. He is smitten. Shortly thereafter, at a Christmas party, the engagement announcement of Yuri and Tonya is interrupted by Lara shooting Komarovsky, Lara's sometime lover and companion. Komarovsky is only slightly wounded and Lara is escorted out of the party by her fiancé, Pasha.World War I erupts and Yuri is posted to a field unit far to southwest near Ukraine. Lara is a volunteer nurse in the same area. Her husband (Pasha), disappears during a battle, and is presumed dead. As the summer of 1917 ends, the October Russian Revolution occurs, changing the entire political landscape. World War I for the Russians had begun to wind down the previous summer, ending in the winter. Yuri and Lara, having worked together in an old country estate converted to a hospital, are the last to leave the now empty facility. They are clearly in love with each other, but have managed to keep their passions suppressed.Yuri returns to his Moscow home to find his step-mother deceased, and his home (his step father's home) occupied by 13 additional families. The Bolsheviks are now in full control of the large cities, and collectivization has begun. But Moscow is in trouble; with virtually no food supplies or heating fuel (wood), the impending Russian winter will be deadly. One night, Yuri decides to steal some fence boards that can be burned. He is observed by Yevgraf (now a policeman and party official) and is followed home. Yevgraf knows this man is his half brother and rather than arrest Yuri, the two connect for the first time. But the works of Yuri Zhivago, the published poet, have fallen out of favor with the authorities putting the lives of Yuri, his wife Tonya, his son Shasha, and his step-father Alexander, in danger. Yevgraf arranges all the necessary travel papers and the family of 4 departs Moscow eastbound in a crowed boxcar. Their destination is Yuriatin, the small town near the family's country estate at Varykino.Enroute, the train stops due to civil war activity in the area. Yuri wanders away from his train, only to stumble into the military train of a communist general. The general turns out to be the husband of Lara, Pasha. But Pasha has taken on a new name, People's Commander Strelnikov. He has become a renegade, and uses his army to fight the remaining White Russians however he can. Strelnikov and Zhivago discover they have seen each other before, at the party where Komarovsky was shot. Suspicions that Yuri is an assassin or spy are determined to be groundless and Strelnikov uncharacteristically releases Yuri. Yuri and family reach their distant estate.It is early spring. The main house has been sealed by the local communist authorities, but the gardener's cottage remains available. The family gets the vegetable garden back in shape, and settles in for what is expected to be a multi-year stay. The family thrives, and remains in the cottage, living almost invisibly. That summer, the czar and his family are executed. The family remains in the cottage through the winter.Finally, the next summer, Yuri takes the short trip into Yuriatin. Lara has lived in Yuriatin for about a year, having returned there in search of her husband, Pasha (Strelnikov). Yuri and Lara meet in the local library, and an affair between the two begins. But Yuri cannot live with the conflict of the affair. His pregnant wife loves him deeply, and so does Lara. Yuri rides into Yuriatin to break off the affair.On the way home, Yuri is kidnapped by a Red Partisan unit and is drafted to be their medical officer. A year and a half later, in the dead of winter, Yuri wanders away from the Red Guard Unit, deserting. Yuri makes his way back to Yuriatin, discovering that his family has left Varykino for Moscow. He goes to the only other place he knows, Lara's small apartment. Starving and nearly dead, Lara brings him back to health. Lara gives Yuri a letter from Tonya, addressed to him care of Lara. The letter is dated 6 months earlier. Tonya had known of Yuri's affair, and Tonya and Lara had met. Yuri's family has escaped back to Moscow, and is being deported from Russia. Shortly thereafter, Komarovsky unexpectedly appears at Lara's apartment. He brings news that Lara's husband Strelnikov is ""gone"", Yuri is considered a deserter, and their days are numbered. Komarovsky offers help by way of transportation to the far east of Russia, Vladavastok, from which they can go anywhere in the world. Lara and Yuri refuse the offer, but know Komarovsky is right, their days are numbered.Lara and Yuri move themselves to Varykino, and occupy a small portion of the main house. They stay there through most of the remaining winter. Again, Komarovsky finds them and tells them that Strelnikov has been arrested just 5 miles from Varykino. Lara and Yuri must now move quickly to survive. They accept Komarovsky's offer of protection and transportation to Manchuria, and leave Varykino immediately. But Yuri remains behind, ostensibly to bring his own sledge to the train station. Lara and Komarovsky wait for Yuri on the train at the Yuriatin train station, but Yuri does not arrive. The train leaves, and Lara announces to Komarovsky that she is pregnant with Yuri's child.Eight years pass. Yuri is found in Moscow by Yevgraf, in poor health, malnourished and jobless. Yevgraf arranges for Yuri to get his old job back at the hospital and sees him off at the street car stop on his first day. On the ride, Yuri thinks he sees Lara walking in the direction of the street car. He attempts to get off the car, succeeds and collapses in the street. He dies of a heart attack.At the memorial, huge numbers of people pay their respects, much to Yevgraf's amazement. One of those people is Lara, and Lara is searching for her daughter Tonya, lost somewhere near Mongolia during the far east civil war. Yevgraf and Lara search Moscow's orphanages, but Tonya is not found. Speaking of Lara, Yevgraf narrates: ""One day she went away and didn't come back. She died or vanished somewhere in one of the labor camps; a nameless number on a list that was after-wards...mislaid. That was quite common in those days.""The story his been told, and the scene returns to the project office. Although Tonya, now a young woman of about 18, wants to believe who were her parents, but only if the fact is true. Morning has come, and Yevgraf makes a final request, that Tonya think about establishing with Yevgraf a family relationship. Neither have any relatives, and Tonya promises to think about it.Tonya and Yevgraf part on what promises to be a beautiful day. As Tonya walks away, Yevgraf notices that she is carrying a balalaika and asks if she knows how to play it. Tonya's companion, responds, of course she does. This gives Yevgraf more proof that he may have found his niece."

Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines or How I Flew from London to Paris in 25 Hours 11 Minutes,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059797/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Hoping to push Britain to the forefront of aviation, a London publisher organizes an international air race across the English Channel, but must contend with two entrants vying for his daughter, as well as national rivalries and cheating. In the infancy of aviation in 1910, a British newspaper offers a prize for the winner of a cross-channel air race which brings flyers from all over the world. There are many subplots as the flyers jockey for position and the affections of various women.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> It's 1910, and flying has become all the rage - as it, as an activity, is still in its infancy. Despite not being a flying enthusiast, Lord Rawnsley (Robert Morley), owner of the Daily Post newspaper, organizes a London, England to Paris, France flying race in order to boost circulation and show Britain's superiority, as he expects his presumptive future son-in-law, Richard Mays (James Fox), will win the race. Richard had suggested the race with the hope of bringing together all of the best aviation minds to advance the issue of flying machine design. Richard's unofficial intended, Patricia Rawnsley (Sarah Miles), is secretly adventurous in nature and wants more than anything to be able to fly, and does whatever she can - against her father's wishes - to be one of those in the air. News of the race goes global, with entries from all over the world. As such, the race becomes a competition for national pride amongst the most adventurous, as flying more than five miles is still considered an accomplishment, let alone traversing the twenty-two mile distance across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France. But it also becomes a competition for Patricia's affections, as one of the entrants is American cowboy Orvil Newton (Stuart Whitman), who is immediately attracted to Patricia - and who may be able to give her that flight that she so much wants, which Richard seems unwilling to do, so as not to get on the wrong side of his future father-in-law.—Huggo"
That Darn Cat!,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059793/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a kidnapped bank teller uses a neighbor's wandering cat to send an S.O.S., the F.B.I. assigns a cat-allergic Agent to the case. A woman is kidnapped. While in captivity, she manages to send a message out with a wandering cat. The cat's owner calls the F.B.I. The F.B.I. tries to follow the cat. Jealous boyfriends and nosy neighbors also get into the act.—Rob Brown <robbrown@tibalt.supernet.ab.ca> Sisters Ingrid (Dorothy Provine) and Patti Randall (Hayley Mills) are fending for themselves in the family home in Santa Monica, California while their parents are traveling abroad. Patti's Siamese cat D.C. - short for ""Darn Cat"" - is a chronic and resourceful explorer, he heading out every night at 9 p.m. in what is usually his successful search for food, with Patti believing he having a standard route through the neighborhood every night. It's after one of D.C.'s night outings that he returns home with what Patti believes is a clue to a criminal case, a two hundred fifty thousand dollar bank robbery where the two masked robbers abducted teller Margaret Miller (Grayson Hall) in the process, she still missing and assumed alive and being held hostage by the robbers. Patti is correct in all of her assumptions. Patti brings her suspicions to the F.B.I., who assigns Agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones) to the case. In trying to discover the robbers' hideout and hopefully a still alive Margaret, Zeke and his team have to track D.C. on his night outings to see where he goes. This task may be a difficult one not only because they don't know how effectively to track a cat, especially an independently-minded one like D.C., but because Zeke is allergic to cat hair, something he failed to mention when he joined the agency and something, if known, could mean the end of his career. Who may factor into the investigation more than Zeke would want is Patti, who Ingrid describes as being overly dramatic, and who wants to do her small part in finding Margaret. But as Patti, and eventually Ingrid, try to hide the fact of the F.B.I. being based out of their house in not wanting to tip off any of their activities, they may face the problems of people constantly interested in the goings-on in the Randall house: their nosy and judgmental next door neighbor Mrs. MacDougall (Elsa Lanchester), whose snooping exasperates her husband (William Demarest); Canoe Henderson (Tom Lowell), Patti's surfing-obsessed boyfriend who has had unobstructed access to the Randall kitchen and the abundance of free food in it; and Gregory Benson (Roddy McDowall), the driver of Ingrid's now two person work carpool, Gregory, a mama's boy of a man, who sees Ingrid as his imminent wife regardless of what Ingrid may think. The two robbers - Dan (Neville Brand) and Iggy (Frank Gorshin) - have their own issues in dealing with a nosy landlady, whose primary interest is to get as much financially out of her new tenants as possible.—Huggo A young woman with an active imagination contacts the F.B.I. when her cat D.C. (Darn Cat) comes home wearing a wristwatch. She's convinced it's the tip-off to crack a bank robbery and kidnapping case that has the authorities baffled. An allergic Agent is assigned to ""tail"" the cat to find the hostage.—Summer S. Wilson <collectonian@mindspring.com>"
The Great Race,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059243/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the early 20th century, two rivals, the heroic Leslie and the despicable Professor Fate, engage in an epic automobile race from New York to Paris. Professional daredevil and white-suited hero, The Great Leslie, convinces turn-of-the-century auto makers that a race from New York to Paris (westward across America, the Bering Straight and Russia) will help to promote automobile sales. Leslie's arch-rival, the mustached and black-attired Professor Fate vows to beat Leslie to the finish line in a car of Fate's own invention.—Jeanne Baker <jbaker@erim.org> In the early twentieth century, the Great Leslie - daredevil and all 'round Renaissance man always clad in white - has several world records to his name in daring feats of courage, always with the faithful Hezekiah by his side. Leslie's arch enemy is the dastardly Professor Fate - always clad in black - who is always trying either to outdo Leslie or thwart Leslie's attempts of daring, without success. Leslie suggests to the Webber Motor Car Company that they show their engineering expertise by building the supreme motor car for a New York to Paris race, that car which they ultimately name the Leslie Special after their inspiration. Not to be outdone, Fate, with his equally dastardly sidekick Max, also enters the race with what he considers his motor car masterpiece, the Hannibal Twin-8. Nothing is too dastardly an act in Fate's goal of winning. One of the other entries is the beautiful Maggie Dubois, a reporter covering the race for the New York Sentinel newspaper. An emancipated woman, Maggie initially tried to convince both Leslie and Fate to use her as their driving partner, both who refused, considering her among the weaker sex. Maggie however convinced the newspaper both to hire her and to sponsor their own car with her as the driver based on the internal struggle within the newspaper's ownership, which is similar to Maggie's own struggles. Maggie expects to win: in her logic, she is covering the entire race (which she does with the use of some primitive but effective technology), meaning she needs to be first at the finish line. Despite being emancipated, Maggie is not averse to using her feminine wiles to her advantage. Through the race, they come across a few adventures and obstacles. But being a long race with much interaction between the racers, their mindsets and priorities may change based on their time together.—Huggo A spectacular land race from New York to Paris in the early 20th century is planned, the two main competitors being the handsome, dashing hero in white, The Great Leslie, and the dastardly, black-suited Professor Fate. While Fate's sidekick, Max, attempts to sabotage Leslie and the other racers, Leslie finds an unlikely ally in Maggie DuBois, a suffragette and journalist-turned-racer whose car breaks down halfway through the event.—Jwelch5742 Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are reunited again, this time with Blake Edwards at the wheel of this epic farce. In an homage to the great silent stars--Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton--""The Great Race"" is classic slapstick and grand adventure combined.The film takes us back to the early days of automobiles, a time when there were hundreds of designers rolling out hand-crafted masterpieces fondly called 'motor cars.' The plot involves an around-the-world motor car race with Tony Curtis, representing good, always impeccably dressed in white and well-mannered. He is the gentleman adventurer and motor car enthusiast who has entered the race with a sporty white roadster. He opens doors and stops to help a lady, even if it happens to be in the middle of a race. Jack Lemmon plays the villain and Curtis' fiercest opponent, dressed of course all in black with a bumbling sidekick a la Lex Luthor in Superman. He drives what only a sinister scientist like Dr. Frankenstein could envision, a machine that is only an automobile in the loosest sense of the word. It is a child's fantasy of what should come standard with an internal combustion engine. There are more gadgets and contraptions that have nothing to do with motoring of course, but everything to do with killing the competition... literally. Curtis has Keenan Wynn as aide, assitant and butler rolled into one highly competent navigator. He is both caricature and anachronism as the misogynistic and chauvanistic eighteenth-century English man servant whose fidelity to position and service is constantly at war with his distrust of women. Right on cue Natalie Woods appears, as the sizzling suffragette supreme, perfectly adorned in full Victorian splendor and parasol to boot. Ms Woods is as stunning as ever and she does her damndest to befuddle Mr. Wynn. She plays the first female reporter for the establisment newspaper. In addition to Mr. Wynn, Ms. Woods bedevils the paper's editor by ignoring his every directive to stay out of the newspaper business and especially his office. His authority though is tenuous at best and constantly undermined by the incessant nagging from his bullying front lineman of a wife who is sympathetic to the women's movement embodied by Ms. Woods. He is well on his way to a nervous breakdown and emasculated to the point that he can no longer summon the resolve to deny Ms. Woods the choice assignment of covering the race. But, as only a true champion of women's rights could cover it, she does so undercover as a contestant, entering a motor car paid for, naturally, by the newspaper.""The Great Race"" is a romp as only a director and an experienced cast esembled here could pull off. It is a film that both celebrates and reinvents the art of story-telling on a big screen. Certainly it is the kind of classic film-making that has been forgotten in an era of big stars, short attention spans and revenue-maximizing studios who want the run time limited to double-digits so they can squeeze in another showing at the local cinelplex. Introduce this one to your kids, though. There is more than enough action and plenty of pratfalls to keep even the most hyperactive riveted to the screen."
Cat Ballou,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059017/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young schoolteacher turns into an outlaw to avenge her murdered father. Cat(herine) Ballou's family farm is being threatened by the railroad. She sends for Kid Shelleen, finding him to be the drunkest gunfighter in the west. When her father is killed by the railroad magnate's gunman, she vows to fight on. Shelleen manages to ride sideways in several scenes, while minstrels sing the ballad of Cat Ballou in between scenes.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> When hired gun Tim Strawn kills her rancher father, Cat Ballou becomes an outlaw set on vengeance. Enlisting the help of washed-up gunslinger Kid Shelleen as well as the handsome bandit Clay Boone, Cat strikes back at the land development company that employed Strawn and eventually targets the assassin himself.—Jwelch5742 1894. Prim and proper innocent Catherine Ballou has just returned to her hometown of Wolf City, Wyoming, to begin her working life as a schoolteacher. She learns that an unknown someone is conspiring to force her father, Frankie Ballou, off his ranch in the name of development, that person or people having hired ""muscle"" in the form of vicious, tin-nosed Tim Strawn. Frankie and his sole ranch hand, a mild-mannered Cherokee named Jackson Two-Bears, are ill-equipped to defend the ranch. As such, Cat takes it upon herself to fortify themselves in the form of convicted cattle rustler Clay Boone - who, in his assistance, has the ulterior motive of wanting to get into Cat's bed - and Clay's associate, ""Uncle"" Jed, who both may be of little help in admitting that they have never fired a gun in their crimes. So into whose basket Cat places most of her eggs is another hired gun she sees advertised on a poster, Kid Shelleen, who, after her $50 payment to him with her merchandise sight unseen, she learns is not all he is advertised to be. Cat's mission changing from protection to retaliation leads her into her own life of crime. What happens in this situation is affected by the Kid's own unspoken history, most specifically with Strawn.—Huggo The Columbia torchbearer morphs into an animated version who takes off her gown revealing herself to be a female gunslinger who draws her pistols from their holsters and gleefully shoots into the air every which way.Two balladeers, Professor Sam the Shade (Stubby Kayne) and the Sunrise Kid (Nat King Cole), playing banjos, tell us in song that ""you're now about to hear, the ballad of Cat Ballou"" (Jane Fonda). A newly constructed gallows has been set up in the middle of town and is being tested with sandbags. As they walk through town, drifting through the crowded main street, Sam and Sunrise continue, relating that Cat killed a man in Wolf City, Wyoming.After the opening credits, Sam and Sunrise stop outside the town jail as a group of temperance woman exhort Pray Jezebel, pray. Cat's barred jail cell window looks out at the gallows. She is putting finishing touches on a white dress hanging on a dress form.Sam and Sunrise finish their song, promising to answer for us, ""how come they're now going to hang you and how did you begin?"" In her jail cell, there is a framed photo of Cat on her graduation day, 1894.FLASHBACKOne year earlier. A train conductor calls out the town of Sumqua as an older woman escorts Cat down the aisle, telling Cat that she is on the threshold of life, having graduated from her academy with a first rate education. As Cat follows the older woman, a man in a sleeping berth peeks out and wolf calls at Cat. Another man walking by with a piglet in his arms leers at Cat. The older woman points out a young man (Michael Callan) sitting in a bench with an older man as being clean. The older man tells the two ladies that the young man is in his custody, at which the young man, smiling, holds up his arm, showing the ladies that he is handcuffed to the older man. The older woman hurriedly guides Catherine away. The young man leans into the aisle to glare at Cat and gives a wolf whistle.Further up the compartment, the older woman notices a man dressed as a parson and asks if he can look after Cat. She says goodbye to Cat, asking her to be a good schoolteacher. Cat sits, the old woman, Miss Parker, leaves.Cat looks back down the aisle and the man in custody is still staring at her. There is a young priest, a parson (Dwayne Hickman), seated right next to her. She introduces herself to the parson as Cat Ballou, and he introduces himself as ""Drunk as a skunk"" and apologizes for his condition. He claims it was the first time he's had alcohol and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. She pulls out a book from her satchel a collection by Tennyson. He grabs it and starts to read definitely not Tennyson something about Kid Shelleen. It turns out Cat had a dime novel nested inside, Kid Shelleen and the Massacre of Whiskey Slide. He gives it back to her and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. A conductor comes by and directs her to a sleeping birth.The parson stumbles off as well and enters a restroom where the man in custody has been handcuffed by the sink as he washes his face. When the lawman appears and blocks the door, the parson blurts out a few nonsensical bible verses. The lawman frisks the parson and steps back to let him in. The parson asks the man in custody if he'd like to hear any bible verses, to which the man replies with a laugh. The parson opens his bible, which has a carved out middle, pulls out a small hand gun, points it at the sheriff, and soberly tells him to raise his hands. The parson covers the sheriff as the man in custody, thanking the priest and calling him Uncle Jed, goes through the sheriffs pockets, and unlocks his handcuff. The sheriff puts up a fight and they struggle but they knock him cold and cuff him to a pipe under the sink. The man and the parson run through the compartment Cat peeks her head out of her lower bunk and sees them and they stop at the gangway. The man asks if the parson has a gun for him, and the parson asks if he took the sheriffs gun. He didn't. The man tells the parson to jump off the train, but the parson looks down and only sees a steep cliff above a rocky sea shore. The man throws the parsons suitcase off the train and then shoves the parson off, too, with him landing safely on a grassy patch. The man runs back to the restroom passing Cat again but hears a gunshot and runs back toward the exit, then ducking into Cats curtain-shrouded sleeping berth. The conductor asks the sheriff what happened and he tells him the prisoner escaped with the help of the parson. The conductor asks if it was the parson sitting with the young girl and they go to her berth. The man in custody has his hand over Cat's mouth, and whispers ""Please"" to her. Cat pops her head out when the sheriff comes by and shakes her head when he asks if she's seen either man. The conductor leads the sheriff to the next car.Cat, in a nightgown, tells herself she shouldn't have done that it was morally wrong. The man, lying next to her, assures her it was the right thing to do. She admits she didn't want the man to get hurt. He snuggles close to her and she tells him to back off. Cat tells him he has to leave when the commotion dies down, and peeks out again down the aisle. He takes advantage of the situation and slips his arm between her head and the pillow. She pushes him off and he rolls on top of her, saying he just wants to see if the coast is clear. She sits up and switches to the other end of the berth. He looks out and sees passengers gathered by the end of the car, where the conductor directed the sheriff; but the other end of the car is passenger-free. He pops back in and tells Cat he saw people with shotguns. He says he will face the shotguns, so as to keep from compromising Cat. He gives her his pocket watch. Touched, she hugs him but then realizes what he is doing. She says she will keep an eye out instead and leans out. He sighs at the sight of her behind in his face. She pops back in and says she thought he was lying (about the people with shotguns) and, surprised, he asks if she meant he wasn't, and peeks out himself. The sheriff, carrying a shotgun, is coming down the aisle, checking each berth. The man ducks back in, slides open Cat's window and starts climbing out. He asks her name and introduces himself as Clay Boone. He kisses her on the mouth and jumps out with a whoop.Sam and Sunrise tell how Cat has returned home to Wolf City where the citizens live high on the hog and are upright, kind, reliable, friendly and neighborly. However, they sing, if Cat had behaved, she would have gotten along, but Cat was depraved and wicked through and through.Cat rides a buckboard through town to a ranch. As an Indian boy watches them, Cat notices an empty corral and asks her father Frank (John Marley), who is driving the wagon, where the horses are. He tells her he sold them, as he was tired of them. She is surprised the house is unpainted and decrepit. As they pull up and get off, the Indian boy comes by and her father introduces him as his new bronc-buster, and speaks Yiddish to him. The boy, Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini), obviously having been through this before, argues that he's a full Sioux Indian, and not one of the Chosen, as the father heard in a dubious lecture given by an ex-Congressman. The father takes Cat's satchel into the house and Jackson struggles with Cat's trunk. Out of earshot of her father, she asks Jackson whats been going on. He tells her the father has rubbed a lot of local people the wrong way. She is incredulous, saying that he is a sweet old bear, and Jackson agrees -- the father was the only one in the county who would give him a job. She says theirs used to be the best spread in the valley, but he shakes his head saying a new outfit is coming in, building factories, making Wolf City a real city. They want her father's water rights and he wont sell. The father comes back out to help with the trunk and promises to build lunch as soon as they go back in. Cat turns toward the house, insisting that she will cook from now on, and runs into a man (Lee Marvin), dressed in black, with a silver prosthetic nose strapped to his face. Cat screams. The man asks if the father is Frankie Ballou, and the father tells him to beat it. The man, carrying a rifle, glares and then strolls off. She asks who he is and Frank ignores her. Jackson tells her the man in black is Tim Strawn, a hired killer who had his nose bit off in a fight. Frank scoffs and says if he were to be scared, he'd be afraid of the man who bit it off. Frank reassures Cat that they are going to eat and sleep and go on living, and go celebrate the Fall Harvest Day tomorrow. Cat watches Strawn ride off.That evening at a dance, as a trio plays, Frank leads Cat in wide circles, taking time out to pat a woman on the behind. Frank bumps into a table where men are playing cards, and a half a dozen men stand around glowering. One of the gamblers is the newly elected Sheriff Cardigan (Jay C. Flippen) who Frank clearly does not respect. Frank points at Cat reminding the sheriff that Cat is back in town, and demands the sheriff greet her courteously. Frank asks the sheriff if he knows who dumped manure into his well. The sheriff says no. Frank says, some sheriff, and storms off. Left with the men, Cat asks the man if he's really the sheriff and then ask why he doesn't help Frank figure out who poisoned his well, obviously in an effort to drive him off his land. The sheriff patronizingly explains that there are ramifications to peace offering that she wouldn't understand. Cat storms off, enraged, and commiserates with Jackson who is at the punch bowl. She asks what she is going to do, and Jackson muses, ""They gotta a gunfighter; you get a gunfighter"". She can't tell if he is being serious or making fun of her, but he replies that no one would bother her dad if Wild Bill Hickok or Bat Masterson were around. A square dance starts and Cat grabs Jackson's arm to go join in. Some of the cowboys who were standing by the card table glower at them as the couple mixes into the crowd.On the floor, Cat asks Jackson who would she get, and he replies, Kid Shelleen. She thought he was just a character in books, but Jackson says hes real and one of the best. He suggests writing Shelleen a letter. Cat dances to Frank on the floor and he says she shouldn't dance with Jackson because he's an Indian. She spins away and, to her surprise, winds up dancing with Clay Boone, the escaped convict from the train. She spins away, back to Frank, and he tells her she's just causing trouble for Jackson. She spins back to Clay and asks why he is there. He says he's looking for her, and she calls him an outlaw. Proudly, he says there's a reward of $25 for the capture of Jed, $35 for himself. Cat falls into a line dance and dances next to Jed, the same man from the train who impersonated a parson, who thanks her for helping him and his nephew (Clay and Jed are about the same age). Cat spins to Clay, who makes a kissy face at her. Cat spins back to Jed and asks where they are staying. He tells her they are hiding out among the crowd and promises not to inflict himself on her any further. Back with Clay, she asks if he has a gun and when he says, sure do, she invites him back home tonight. As Cat dances toward the stage, we see its Sam calling the dance, and Sunrise at the piano. Cat spins to Jackson and compliments him on his dancing. He says he danced on the reservation : buffalo dance, rain dance, and then looking back at the cowboys glowering at them, says, war dance. They dance away and the men step onto the floor, accosting Jackson. The chief glowerer calls Jackson, Low, and pokes Jackson on the chest. Jackson shrugs and says its ""Custers Last Stand all over again"" and punches the man, which instigates an all-out brawl. Frank goes to rescue Jackson, as everyone, including Cat, join in the fight. Jackson pulls off a toupee of an opponent and gives a war whoop. Cat throws a chair at the chief glowerer, knocking him out, and gives a war whoop as well. Clay and Jed sneak around the perimeter, trying not to get involved, but are tackled and piled on by a scrum. Frank cheers on the woman he had patted on the bottom, Mabel, as she beats up a mustached man. Two kids, watching from the hayloft, throw hay at each other.Frank drives the wagon back to the ranch with Cat, Jackson, Clay and Jed. They are singing happily and drunkenly. Cat gets off and lands in Clay's arms. Frank continues singing and literally falls off the wagon, caught just in time by Clay and Jed. They carry Frank, now passed out, into the house. Jackson whispers to Cat if she thinks the pair of free-loaders will be able to stop Strawn. She assures him that they are gunmen and have a price on their heads. Clay looks around, admiring the house with its living room, kitchen... and bedroom. Cat says Clay and Jed will sleep in the barn; Jackson tosses each a blanket.Before going to bed, Cat sits at her dresser and brushes her hair. Unknown to her, Clay is hiding under her covers, and he smiles when she blows a playful kiss to the mirror. She gets in bed and Clay slowly covers her mouth to keep her from screaming. She jumps out and demands that he gets out before her father catches them, but Clay assures her that the father is out cold. He invites her back to bed to spoon and she stands on the mattress and kicks him onto the floor. He heads toward the door, but with a change in tone, Cat asks where he's going and tells him not to go. He turns and smiles, but she tells him she just needs to talk to him. As he sits at the end of the bed, she tells him her father is a wonderful man, but the town hates him, has dropped manure into his well, has made him talk to lawyers, and now has sent a gunman around to drive him off. Clay thinks she is dreaming. She assures him she saw the gunman. He plays along and says, then he will help her pack; her father can defend himself. Frustrated she says Clay is useless, and he agrees. As she buries her face in her pillow, Clay suggests since they hired a gunman, that she do the same. She looks up briefly and buries her face again. He then asks her about the kiss she made before going to bed; Cat moans in frustration. He pauses and gets up to leave. She calls him back, saying that everyone has some good in them and can't be as depraved or cowardly as they may think. He grabs her shoulders and assures her that some people in the world are exactly as depraved and cowardly as they think. He leans in for a kiss but Jed pops up at the window and asks Clay how long they are staying. Cat reminds Jed she had helped him on the train and asks if he can help her now. She asks if he can stay, that there's someone trying to kill her father. Jed says they'll stay and do what they can. Cat nods at Clay and says then they wont need him, but Clay tells Cat that Jed has never shot at a man before its against his principles. Cat is incredulous and then Jed tells her that neither has Clay. They leave.Cat picks up the Kid Shelleen novel from her nightstand, thinks a little, and sits at her desk to write a letter.Sam and Sunrise sing about the arrival of a fast gun into town. A stagecoach pulls up outside the telegraph office. Cat and Jackson are waiting outside. They smile happily as a tall man exits the coach, but then five kids and a woman run up to hug him. The stage drivers open the back boot flap and balled up inside is a dusty drunk old man (also Lee Marvin in a dual roll), who is the gunfighter Kid Shelleen. They tug him out and he flops onto the ground, semi-conscious. The crew drops off his valise and a paper sack, and Cat and Jackson run up to the body. Jackson rolls him over; he's still passed out. She gets the men to carry him onto their wagon. Cat grabs the sack and gets in the back of the wagon with the man, Jackson retrieves the valise, and as Sam and Sunrise sing about ""the fastest gun you've ever seen"", Cat and Jackson drive off.Frank wedges a plank between the clapboards of his barn and draws a chalk circle on it. He walks back a few paces and we see Cat, Jackson, Clay and Jed as Frank demands Kid Shelleen shows him what Cat got for the $50 she laid out, now that hes had a few hours to sleep it off. Kid gets up, squares off, and reaches for his gun, but he doesn't have one he hocked it for drink money. Frank yells at Cat for wasting the money and for the possibility that the ill-spent $50 worth of drink could have killed the man. Cat says she didnt know he was a drunk, and at that, Kid turns to look at Cat, sadly. Clay steps up and hands Kid a revolver. Kid can barely hold the gun steady. Frank guesses that Kid would rather have a drink than a poke in the eye. Kid gets a shot off but hits the weather vane on top of the roof. Clay points out that Kid actually missed the barn. Kid rushes up to Frank, who recoils at Kids breath, and begs him for a nip to steady his hand. Frank asks Jackson if hes carrying the bottle he uses to get the sheriff mad. Kid takes a swig, and then another, and keeps the bottle when Jackson tries to take it back. In between more swigs, he tells them his recent history, including that he worked the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. He shoots and hits the circle on Franks plank, twice; a tin can on top of a trellis; and another tin can on another trellis, and then again as it flies off the trellis. Cat and the men are impressed. Kid almost finishes Jackson's bottle, and tosses it in the air, but when he tries to pull the gun from the front of his pants, his pants fall halfway down, he stumbles, and asks where the bottle went. Cat looks dejected. Kid rattles off some gunslinger philosophy. Cat tries to defend Kid, but Frank tells her to keep Kid away from him, and stomps away. Cat asks Kid where he will go now, and he replies that shes paid him, so he intends to stay. Cat says Kid will sleep in the barn. Clay takes back his gun. Jackson offers to carry Kid's valise, and Kid asks him how many are in the opposition. Jackson says, one, Tim Strawn, and at hearing that name, Kid rears back and stumbles away. He bends down to pick up Jackson's bottle and asks if Jackson is sure. When Jackson says, yes, Kid finishes the bottle.At lunch, Cat laments that Kid is in no condition to defend her father, and asks Jackson, Clay and Jed to stay by Franks side. They agree. Frank walks through the kitchen on his way out and the men get up and walk out with him. Cat yells at them not to let Frank out of their sight. Outside, with the men shadowing him, Frank says Cat is crazy, like her late mother, and tells the men that theres no one around to bother him. As he marches off, a shot rings out and Frank falls. In the distance Strawn, on horseback, points a rifle at them, and tells them to drop their gun belts. Cat rushes up to Frank who is dead. Strawn rides off and Cat gets on her horse and follows. The men retrieve their gun belts and follow as well.Cat makes it to town and finds Strawn sitting on a rocking chair outside the saloon. The Sheriff and a few men are standing nearby. Cat accuses Strawn of being a murderer, but the corrupt Sheriff lies by saying that's not possible since Strawn had been sitting right there all morning. The men with him agree. Understanding the situation, Cat angrily pounces on Strawn but is pulled back by Jackson, Clay and Jed. She takes Clays revolver from his belt and tries to shoot Strawn, but in the struggle misses wildly. Strawn pulls his own gun but looks around, knowing he is being baited. Defiantly, Cat tells the Sheriff that he won't make her cry, and turns to Strawn and says the same to him.As the sun sets, and as Cat and the men ride back home, Sam and Sunrise sing that there are teardrops in Cats heart, but they cant make her cry.As they come up to the house, most of her furniture has been moved outside and a man is sitting on the front porch who tells her that this is private property, pointing at a sign proclaiming, 'Property of Wolf City Development Corp. No Trespassing'. Cat pushes her way in and sees two undertakers standing next to Frank lying in a pine box. She demands to know why Frank has a smile on his face as hes never smiled before. The undertaker says its free, courtesy of the Wolf City Development Corp. She shoves them out. A man with a rifle comes up and tells Cat that they've dug a grave behind the barn and that they will stay to make sure that Cat and her men leave before morning.Cat says she doesn't want the ranch now that Frank is dead, but she wants Wolf City to know that she intends to make Shermans March look like a bird walk.Jed points out to Clay that Cat wont have a place to stay and Clay suggests they take her with them to Hole-in-the-Wall. However, Clay's not sure they will let her in, or even let him and Jed in. Cat brightens to the idea, saying that all they need is to be outlaws, and Clay and Jed have a price on their heads, so they are outlaws. Clay agrees, hesitantly.Kid stumbles in, drunk, saying that he's ready, and that anyone who tries to get Frank will have to go through him first. Jed directs his attention to Frank in the box, but Kid notices the candelabras around the coffin and starts singing Happy Birthday. Kid blows out the candles.The next morning, Cat and the men ride off as Sam and Sunrise sing about the beginning of the Legend of Cat Ballou. As Clay and Jed, riding behind Cat, admire her from behind. They are towing a riderless horse, which is pulling a litter with Kid lying down. Jackson, reaching down from his horse, hands Kid a bottle, which Kid bobbles and drops.They ride up on Hole-in-the-Wall and are met with kids scurrying to their mothers, and men patrolling the streets, carrying rifles. Kid sits up from the litter, sniffing, and says he smells a water hole its the town saloon. Kid stumbles in and yells for the bartender. Kid is recognized by the bartender, an aged, worn-out Butch Cassidy (Arthur Hunnicutt), knocked down the ladder of life by the cavalry and the Pinkertons and the changing West. Kid suggests they have a drink for old times sake which Cassidy knows means that Kid has no money. Kid offers him his guns in exchange, but Cassidy says the guns aren't worth anything, anymore; no one cares.Cat and the men are at a table. As Kid sits down with them, Clay is talking to Jed about getting back in to business. He thinks they will need more men and asks Jackson if he is interested in helping them rustle 50 head of cattle. Kid interrupts, asking if anyone wants to buy a round and continues to interrupt them, saying hell drink to that, after each point of conversation. Cat, reading a newspaper, says she is against their plan for raising money and suggests they rob a train. Clay and Jed ignore her and get back to talking rustling. Cat interrupts and points at an article about how 200 local men were recently hired to build a slaughterhouse and these men will need to be paid. She thinks there will be at least $1,000 to $2,000 in each payroll. Clay says that shes out of her mind -- they are rustlers, not train robbers. Jed waxes philosophical and urges her to get off the path of revenge.Cat pulls out her Kid Shelleen novel and flips to Kid Shelleens own plan to rob a train. Kid perks up at hearing of the plan HIS plan. As she reads, the men bow their heads and she becomes upset at their reluctance. She reminds them that they had said they love her and had promised to take care of her, but now she is only asking them to rob one little train and they turn on her. Cat runs outside and they follow. She picks up rocks and throws them at the men, calling them a horse ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac, and an uncle. As she continues to throw rocks, she calls them Clay Boone and his band of chicken rustlers. Jed says they never said, no. He asks her to stop crying and that they will do it for her. Kid, standing at the saloon door, wonders about the plan.A train rumbles through the countryside. Jed, sitting in a passenger car, checks his watch and walks out the back to another car. It is a well-appointed private car and there is a man (Reginald Denny) and his valet. The British-accented man is sitting in a bathtub. Jed says hes looking for the baggage car, and the man, miffed, directs him back forward. Jed exits and climbs up to the roof of the passenger car he had exited. Jed walks forward, making a lot of noise. Inside the baggage compartment at the front of the car, Cat, dressed in mourning clothes, leaning over a coffin, starts wailing loudly to keep the baggage employee distracted from Jed's noise. Jed climbs down and unhitches the passenger cars from the locomotive. The locomotive rumbles ahead without the cars, which slow down. Jackson and Kid are sitting on their horses, watching the whole situation from a distance. Kid takes a swig, but Jackson takes the bottle and admonishes him they have a job to do. They ride down to the tracks with two riderless horses in tow.Jed pulls the handbrake, causing packages in the baggage compartment to tumble around, and the water to slosh out of the Englishmans bathtub. As the baggage employee helps Cat up, a knock comes from the coffin. The employee backs away in fright as Cat looks heavenward and happily says, hes alive! Cat opens the coffin and Clay climbs out. With Cat nudging him, Clay pulls out his gun and holds it on the employee. Jed climbs into the baggage compartment as Jackson and Kid watch over the passengers. The Englishman walks in with a towel around his waist, demanding to speak to the person in charge. Kid says, he is, and that the train is being robbed. The Englishman demands they hurry it up because he is taking a bath. Kid pulls off the mans towel and the man scurries off.Ahead, the engineer notices his cars have been detached and reverses the locomotive. Jed finds the trains safe and Cat demands the employee open it. The man says no. Clay reminds him he as a gun, but the employee says that Clay will have to use it. Cat and the men huddle and whisper about what they are going to do. Kid walks up to the baggage compartment and sees the locomotive coming back. Kid asks whats wrong, and Clay tells him the employee wont open the safe and would rather die. Kid asks the man if thats true, and then shoots the mans hat off. The man immediately tells them the combination.Clay notes there's more than the one or two thousand dollars Cat predicted, in fact, there's probably $50,000. The locomotive backs into the cars and causes Cat and the men to fall over, and the Englishman's bathtub to slosh out water again. The engineer drives the re-attached train forward, causing the Englishman to fall out of the tub in a big splash. Jackson rides beside the train, towing the horses. Kid sees him and jumps off the train onto Jackson's horse. Clay urges Cat and Jed to jump, and they do, with the bag of money. They land safely and Cat whoops and hugs the men. Jackson and Kid ride up and Cat praises Kid for his plan. Kid waves his hand at Jackson and Jackson hands him the bottle. Clay asks Kid how the plan in the dime novel wound up, and Kid, taking a swig, says they ride off separately and meet back at Hole-in-the-Wall. Cat heads off, with Clay following her, and Jed following them. Jackson watches Kid finish the bottle.Kid tips off his horse and the horse gallops away as Kid drunkenly hangs off the saddle half-horizontally. Jackson follows and they ride past Sam and Sunrise who sing about Cat masterminding the train robbery.The train pulls into the next town and the conductor tells the sheriff what happened and he in turn rounds up a posse which rides off after Cat and her band of desperados. As they head out into the brush, Jackson and Kid, still uncontrolled on his horse, ride up behind the posse. Jackson grabs Kids reins and turns them back around. The posse follows. They split up and the posse divides in half to follow Jackson and Kid. Jackson catches up to Kid and they resume their escape.Back at Hole-in-the-Wall, Kid storms in to the saloon and boasts about their exploits to Cassidy. He notices, worriedly, that Cat and the men aren't there. They come in, elated, but Kid asks Cat why they were delayed and if Clay had bothered her. Clay says they were losing the posse; Jed says he was doing his job. Clay laughs to Jed that Kid is jealous. Kid grabs Clay by the shirt and tells him that Clay has no respect. Cat separates them and Clay tells Cassidy to get Kid a drink. Cassidy asks if they really did it and Cat proudly says that they did, her gang. She says they are going to wipe out Wolf City. She tells Cassidy that theres more where that came from and if they help her, there will be more for them. Cassidy picks up a money sack and reads the inscription : Wolf City Development, Property H. Percival. Cassidy tells Cat that Sir Harry Percival owns Wolf City Development, which owns Wolf City, which lets Hole-in-the-Wall alone. Cat decides that she should go after Percival and asks Cassidy to help. He refuses, as that would be cutting their own throats. Dejected, she tells Cassidy that Hole-in-the-Wall had the reputation for harboring cutthroats and murderers; that they used to whisper their names when they were kids scared to say them out loud. She scoffs they got old and walks out. Clay follows her.As she walks contemplatively in a copse of trees, Clay comes up behind Cat and surprises her. He grabs her and kisses her. He tells her they should go to Saint Louis now that they got the money, but she says now that Wolf City is desperate, she should continue her plan. They kiss and she tells him she thinks she loves him. He laughs it off; that she's being too serious. She says he's not as cowardly as he thinks he is, that he may be selfish and a little stupid, but not cowardly. She says she sees his faults but loves him anyway. He says he sees trouble, pointing toward the direction of the posse, and then, saying in Cats eyes as well. He says hes not going to be tied down by a girl and that he's going to Saint Louis. He warns her that shes going to get herself killed. He walks off, saying he never promised he was going to be a hero. She yells back that hes not a hero and tells him to leave. He says bye and walks off.Jackson has overheard some of their conversation and comes up to Cat. She asks what is happening. He tells her that when the gods decide to make a man crazy, that they just made him fall in love. She discounts that, wondering who is falling in love with whom. She asks Jackson if he will stay, and he says he likes being on the winning side for a change. He walks away.Cat continues her walk and Strawn rides up and tells her Sir Harry wants his money back. He adds that if she wasn't a girl, that he'd split her like a chicken. She screams as he rides off. Jackson, Jed and Kid run up. Jackson and Jed console Cat as Kid stares after Strawn. Kid calls Jackson over and tells him to find his valise and to get a case of cartridges from Cassidy. As Jackson runs off, Kid walks over to Cat and assures her everything will be okay.Kid decides to become sober and clean himself up for his confrontation with Strawn. As Kid rubs his trembling hands together, Jackson brings him the valise. Kid does some sit-ups. Jackson massages the Kid's back as the Kid tests the steadiness of his hands. Kid practices his quick draw -- at first Jackson is able to clap before Kid can level his gun, but Kid gets faster as they go. Kid shoots at cans and bottles that Jackson tosses in the air. He hits every one. Jackson asks Kid if he wants a drink, but Kid tells him, ""no booze"". Jackson adds water as Kid takes a steaming bath. Kid shaves with a straight razor.Jackson opens the valise and takes out a girdle. Jackson helps Kid, standing in front of a full-length mirror in his long johns, get into the girdle. As Jackson helps him with his shirt, Kid looks at his hand; it is steady. Kid has silvery garters for his shirt sleeves and a matching vest. Jackson helps him with his gun belt with a garish silver buckle. Kid holsters his shiny guns. Jackson helps him put on his hat with a silver hat band. Kid is now sober and dressed in his finest.Sam and Sunrise are singing and play piano at a brothel. Kid comes in, spurs jangling, and goes upstairs. He walks down the hall, opening each door, only to be greeted by a woman's scream... and then a mans scream, where Kid does a double-take. At the last door, he finds Strawn. Strawn, sitting, says ""it's been a long time"". Kid notices Strawn's silver nose and strap on the dresser. Strawn asks Kid if he's there for money or for a job. Kid squares up. Strawn stands and notes that there's never been any love lost between them. Strawn goes for his gun, but Kid says he cant, and turns away. Strawn draws anyway, Kid kneels down and draws. In the drawing room, the Englishman is being entertained by three prostitutes. We hear the gun shot.Back at the Hole-in-the-Wall saloon, a black clad man with a silver nose barges in. Cat shrieks, but its Kid. He takes off the nose and twirls it by the strap. He happily kicks back in a chair and says it was just swell. Kid says that even when they were kids, Strawn would always sneak around and shoot kids in the back, and he thinks Strawn thought Kid was still on the booze. Cat is surprised that Kid and Strawn used to play together as kids. Kid says that he and Strawn are twin brothers; Cat, Jackson and Jed are shocked. Kid continues to reminisce and says he took Strawn just like the dime novel said.Clay busts in and says that Kid has brought the roof down; that half of Wolf City is on its way to Hole-in-the-Wall. Kid looks at Cat and assures her they can take them like they did last time. Clay continues and says that Percival has added at least fifty of his own goons. Kid grabs Clay by the arm and demands that he try to remember if the men were professionals or just barroom sweeps. Clay describes them as professionals. Kid says that with Strawn dead, they might as well be sweeps. Clay warns that Strawn was just a hired hand, and that these men are an army. He grabs Cat and says he's taking her out of there. Cat asks Clay if hes sure about the men. As he embraces Cat, Kid says if Percival wants a fight, then they'll give him one he and Cat Ballou. Clay accuses Kid of wanting to die. Kid says he's done everything he's wanted to do and been everywhere he's wanted to go. He says he and Cat can make history. Clay accuses Kid of trying to get Cat killed. Kid says its better than dying in a dirty hotel, or off somewhere drunk a fate he was always afraid of for himself until Cat came along. Cat tenderly tells Kid that there are places she wants to see and things she wants to do.Clay says now she is making sense, that they can now go to Saint Louis. She rejects him. He suggests Sioux Falls. She rejects him again. He asks if shes afraid to be seen with him that he will marry her. Cat is indignant that he thinks THAT is what a woman wants a man to say or do in order to save her. She runs out.Kid glares at Clay and says he's been studying her and now realizes that Cat loves Clay, not himself. He also realizes Clay had been laughing at him the whole time and says that he will make Clay do the right thing. Kid circles the table, grabs a chair and smashes it into little pieces. Jed and Jackson grab Clay and hold him away from Kid. Kid proposes guns, bottles, fists, knives, clubs, they're all the same to him. Clay doesn't know what Kid is talking about. Kid demands he marry Cat. Clay says he would, but Cat won't. Kid philosophizes that ""at first you can't stand to get hit, but then you realize you CAN take it, because the blood doesn't matter and you know you're going to live"". Kid tells Clay that he's giving Clay a gift to know that it doesn't hurt to fight. Kid chases Clay around the saloon and roundhouses him into Jed. Jed punches Clay into a chair, saying that Clay is kin and has been a millstone around his neck all his life. Clay stumbles to Kid, realizes what he is doing, and stumbles toward Jackson, who also punches him, saying everyone else was doing it and he shouldn't be excluded for reasons of race, creed or color according to the Fourteenth Amendment. Cassidy pops his head in and asks if he can have his saloon back now that Cat is leaving. They all rush to the window to see her riding off.Cat, dressed like a prostitute, calls on Percivals private railroad car. The valet introduces her as a consolation from the town. Percival is beside himself. She takes off her stole, revealing a low-cut dress, and hands it to the valet who scurries off. Percival asks if she wants a drink and he calls the valet to bring it. She says her name is Trixie and says shes never seen a train car like this and he shows her the bedroom. The valet brings champagne and Percival dismisses him for the evening.Percival turns to put on a phonograph and to dim the lights and when he turns back around, Cat has a gun on him. She re-introduces herself as Catherine, Frank Ballous daughter. He is not impressed. She produces a rolled up piece of paper from her bodice and demands that he signs it. Its a confession, saying that he hired Strawn to kill Frank. He asks what if he doesn't sign, and she says shell kill him. He is still not impressed. He doubts she has it in her, and goes for the gun. They struggle and the gun goes off; Percival falls dead.CURRENT TIMEBack outside the town jail, Cat, in her white dress, watches through her window as the temperance women continue to sing. The crowd outside is now much larger. The Sheriff, standing outside her cell, has been eyeing his pocket watch, and happily declares it is time. Cat looks out the window again and says she's sorry the people do not like her. The Sheriff says its understandable, since her killing Percival ended the plans for the slaughterhouse, so now there are no jobs, and no payroll. He continues that she took the bread out of the mouths of half of Wolf City; and that she doesnt have a friend in the world. The Sheriff calls for the reverend. As he blurts out a few nonsensical bible verses, Cat recognizes it is Jed.... dressed once again in his parson's disguise. He leads her out of the cell.Meanwhile, Jackson, dressed like an undertaker, runs up and sees Kid on his horse, both slumped against the jail house wall... drunk once again. Jackson is disappointed that Kid chose this time to fall of the wagon and that they are all counting on him. Kid waves him off.Jed walks Cat through the jeering crowd. The temperance women are singing Rock of Ages. On the gallows are the Sheriff and a few men including the hangman and Jed. The Sheriff tells the crowd to quiet, and asks Cat for her last words. She says, ""Let's get on with it"". The Sheriff gives the signal and the hangman puts the noose around Cat's neck. She looks back at Jed but he just looks away. Under the gallows, in the coffin intended for Cats body, Clay lifts the lid and peeks out. Jackson, sitting on the horse-drawn hearse next to the gallows, looks back and sees Kid in the same position he was before. The Sheriff gives the signal and a man pulls the lever. Cat falls. Jed has produced a razor from his fake bible and cuts the rope. Clay is under the trapdoor and catches Cat in his arms. Jackson has the side door to the hearse open, and Clay helps Cat inside; he follows her. Jed jumps off the gallows onto the roof of the hearse and sits down next to Jackson. They ride off. Jed asks Jackson where Kid is, but Jackson shakes his head. As they drive down the main street, men with rifles follow, and Kid finally rides into view, half-horizontally again. He shoots randomly causing a banner to fall and tangle up a man on a horse. Another shot frightens some draft horses that run off and spill their load of beer casks, which causes the road to become slippery, and other riders to slip and fall. One of the casks pops its cork near Kids horse, spooks the horse, which carries Kid, half-horizontally, out of town.Sam and Sunrise sing that where Cat rode off to is a mystery, but that she's made history, and that her legend continues to grow.The hearse rides off into the mountains with Kid, half-horizontally on his horse, following. Jackson, sitting next to Jed, takes off his undertakers top hat and happily puts on his own. Cat and Clay, looking out the back of the hearse, kiss.THE END"

Von Ryan's Express,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059885/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An American POW leads a group of mainly British prisoners to escape from the Germans in WWII. Ryan, an American POW, leads his fellow prisoners on a dangerous escape from the Germans in Italy. Having seemingly made errors of judgment, Ryan has to win the support of the mainly British soldiers he is commanding.—Rob Hartill Col. Ryan of the US Army is shot down in Italy and taken to a prison camp. He's to lead prisoners on an escape. But not all the soldiers trust him at first, due to mistakes he's made. It's up to Ryan to win the support of the mainly British soldiers whose lives he's trying to save.—Michael Daly (fanstp43@aol.com) August 1943- Nazi-occupied Italy. An American P-38 Lightning fighter plane with smoke trailing from one of its engines sputters and loses altitude above an Italian coastal town. A pair of German officers abruptly interrupt their lunch to catch up with the rapidly descending plane. When the Germans arrive at the crash site, they encounter a burning fuselage surrounded by Italian soldiers. The soldiers explain that the pilot was killed in the crash. Satisfied, the Germans leave. As soon as they are gone, the Italians mock their imperious occupiers and part ranks to reveal a hidden and slightly injured American flyer, Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra).Ryan is taken to an Italian POW camp filled with British and American prisoners. Italian discipline over the camp is lax and the prisoners are filthy and ragged. Constant escape attempts have enraged the Italian commandant and resulted in the withholding of clean clothes, hot water, razors, and food parcels. The ranking British officer has just died while imprisoned in the camp sweat box. Command has fallen to the irascible British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) of the Ninth Fusiliers. The pragmatic Ryan and the inflexible Major Fincham immediately clash, with Ryan outranking Fincham and able to countermand his orders.With the Americans only weeks from liberating the camp, Ryan wants all futile escape attempts stopped. He betrays the active escape tunnels to the Italian commandant, Major Battaglia (Adolfo Celi), earning both the enmity of the British prisoners and the scornful nickname ""Von Ryan."" As a reward for Ryan's cooperation, Battaglia turns the showers back on and issues razors and Red Cross parcels. But he balks at issuing clean clothing, since he is selling the donated clothes on the black market. Ryan orders the men to strip and burn their filthy clothes. As punishment, Ryan is placed in the sweat box while the men receive their clean clothing.Some time later, Ryan's fellow inmates release him from the box with the welcome news that the Allies have landed at Salerno and Italy has surrendered. The Italian guards have fled, but Major Battaglia has been captured. Major Fincham intends to convene a court martial before summarily executing him. Ryan intervenes, countermanding Fincham's orders and directing instead that Battaglia be confined in the sweat box. Fincham is furious and again accuses Ryan of treachery. Battaglia's second-in-command, Captain Oriani (Sergio Fantoni), tells the group that the Germans will soon be coming to recapture them, and he offers to lead the men to safety.The camp's 400 former inmates pour out of the stockade behind Oriani. German troops occupy the main roads, so the men are forced to travel through the woods, stopping for the night in some abandoned ruins. Captain Oriani goes ahead to scout out an escape route. Meanwhile, the Germans reach the empty prison camp and hear furious knocking from inside the sweat box. Battaglia is quickly released, and he informs the Germans of the recent prisoner exodus.The next morning, the escaped fugitives are quietly surrounded by German troops. Those prisoners who try to flee are gunned down, and the rest are marched to a nearby rail siding. The ambulatory prisoners are loaded onto boxcars while the sick and wounded are shot. Aboard the train, the men discover a severely beaten Captain Oriani. The train is apparently headed for a prison camp in Germany. More bitter recriminations are directed toward ""Von Ryan"" for his decision to spare Major Battaglia's life.The train stops in Rome, where the prisoners are offloaded and fed. Back on board the train, Major Fincham continues his steady stream of invective against Ryan. He sarcastically comments that they won't be able to ""tunnel"" their way out this time. The intended insult gives Ryan the idea for a desperate escape plan. Each boxcar is guarded by a German soldier riding on top, armed with a machine pistol. A couple of the floorboards in Ryan's boxcar are prised up so that there is a way to drop to the tracks below. After another brief stop and under the cover of darkness, the prisoners lower themselves one at a time from the slowly rolling train until their heels are dragging over the rail bed below the car. Then they allow themselves to fall flat on their backs as the cars pass over them. At the right moment, each prisoner rolls quickly between the wheels and over the rails, then springs upright to catch up with the nearest car. Once mounted on the ladders between cars, the prisoners are positioned to climb to the roof and crawl up behind each guard, strangling him with a rope. Ryan kills the first guard in this manner, appropriating his helmet and machine pistol. When the train stops again, Ryan orders Fincham to free other prisoners from the locked boxcars and attack the remaining guards. The prisoners are soon in command of the train, but just as they get underway they hear another train approaching from behind. The captured Wehrmacht officer aboard the prisoner train informs Ryan that it is a German troop train on the same schedule as their own and heading for the same destination- Innsbruck, Austria.Now the fleeing men must find a way to redirect their train toward neutral Switzerland, not an easy task when the rail lines and rolling stock are controlled by the Nazis. Many tense situations will have to be overcome as the action moves toward a violent climax high in the Italian Alps."

Now with a third incident (shooting a deer), a judge orders her to send the boy to an Episcopal boarding school where Dr. Edward Hewitt (Richard Burton) is headmaster, and his wife Claire (Eva Marie Saint) teaches.At an initial interview, there is a momentary immediate attraction between Laura and Edward, but this quickly turns into tension brought on by their greatly differing world views and Laura's dislike of religion. Finally, she storms out. She attempts to flee the area with her son but they are quickly picked up by police who take Danny to the school. He initially has trouble fitting in because his mother's home-schooling has left him far in advance of boys his age in several subjects; the standard course of instruction at Edward's school leaves him restless and bored. At Claire's suggestion, Edward visits Laura to learn more about Danny and his upbringing.Laura's unconventional morals initially disturb Edward, such as modeling topless for an artist friend named Cos Erickson (Charles Bronson), for Laura's ways conflict with his religious training. After visiting her several more times, he finds that he wants her very much and cannot get her out of his mind. The two begin a torrid extramarital affair. Edward struggles with the guilt this produces, while Laura encourages him to accept their love as right. Meanwhile, Danny flourishes after Edward relaxes school rules and allows the boy to choose more advanced classes.But one evening, the secret love affair is eventually exposed by a remark made to Edward in the presence of Claire by a jealous former lover of Laura's, and Edward is forced to confess all to his wife. At first, Claire is distraught, but later they quietly discuss it in the light of how their lives have diverged from the idealistic religious fervor of the first years of their marriage. He says that he still loves her and that he will end the affair. They decide to separate for a while. When Edward tells Laura that he told his wife about their affair, she too gets angry over being the second woman in his life and tells them that their relationship is over, too.A few days later, with the school year over, Laura tells Danny that they can move away for she has made enough money from her painting sales for them to leave. But Danny refuses for he has put down roots at the school and wants to stay there. She has a moment of pain but realizes her son's need to be free and agrees to stay where they are for now. Danny asks Laura to come to church to hear him and the choir sing. She doesn't want to be placed in that position to be in church with Edward and Claire, but because she loves Danny and wants to support him, she agrees.During the service, Edward resigns his position at the school and the church. In his resignation speech, he mentions some of the things he'll miss and although they sound generic, they are things he and Laura shared. Tears fill her eyes. After the service, Edward sees Laura and tells her he is leaving the area and going to travel. As a parting gift, Edward has arranged for Danny to attend school tuition-free. All Laura can do is look at Edward with tears in her eyes.In the final scene, on Edward's way out of town, he stops at Laura's place for a silent farewell. She and Danny are down on the beach, Edward up on the bluff above looking down at them. When Laura sees him, she thinks he's come back to her and not going to leave. She smiles and turns from her painting to start toward him, but he turns and walks away."
For a Few Dollars More,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059578/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two bounty hunters with the same intentions team up to track down an escaped Mexican outlaw. Drifting from town to town, the poncho-clad Man with No Name and the lightning-fast right hand rides into the town of El Paso in search of maniacal escaped convict El Indio. It's been 18 short months since the deadly confrontation inA Fistful of Dollars (1964), and this time, the solitary stranger, now a professional bounty hunter, must go against his beliefs and do the unthinkable: join forces with hawk-eyed marksman Colonel Douglas Mortimer to collect the hefty reward. Now, as El Indio and his cut-throats have already set their sights on robbing the crammed-with-cash Bank of El Paso, the stage is set for a bloody showdown at high noon, against the backdrop of silent double-crosses and fragile allegiances. But, is it worth dicing with death for a few dollars more?—Nick Riganas Manco (Clint Eastwood) is a bounty killer chasing El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè) and his gang. During his hunt he meets Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), another bounty killer, and they decide to make a partnership, chase the bad guys together, and split the reward. During their enterprise, there will be lots of bullets and funny situations. In the end, one of the bounty hunters shows the real intention of his hunt.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film begins with Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) illegally stopping the train he is riding on outside the small town of Tucumcari. He rides on his horse to the town's brothel where he confronts, chases and shoots down a wanted criminal, collecting a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (José Terrón). Mortimer's gun-slinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty he inquires the sheriff about Red ""Baby"" Cavanagh (José Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted by a stranger, who is referred to as ""Manco"" (meaning one-handed in Spanish - and Italian).We first see Manco (Clint Eastwood) ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Manco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty.Elsewhere, a Mexican bandit named Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) is serving a jail sentence but his gang arrive and kill several guards to free their leader. Indio escapes and more guards are killed but Indio spares the life of one so that he can let people know what he and his men are capable of.Soon, Indio gets hold of the bounty hunter responsible for putting him behind bars. He has the man's wife and child killed and challenges him to an unfair duel. Indio takes his life.Indio is a ruthless, intelligent man. He has a musical pocket watch that he plays before engaging in gun duels. ""When the chimes finish, begin,"" he says. In flashbacks (usually as Indio drifts into narcotic-induced sleep) it is revealed that the watch originates from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who killed herself while being raped by Indio after he had found her with her lover and killed him. The watch bears a photo of the woman and was presented as a gift by the young man before being killed. Indio's dreams convey a suspicious impression that he is becoming consumed by guilt for the girl's death.Having learned of Indio's manhunt and reward money, Manco arrives in the town of El Paso and soon crosses paths with Mortimer. Both men believe Indio will rob the town's bank - the Texan equivalent of Fort Knox, that holds a safe containing ""almost a million dollars"". The two hunters' theory is confirmed when several of Indio's men arrive to stake out the town and Mortimer tries to goad one of the gunmen, The Hunchback Wild (Klaus Kinski) into a fight but he refuses in order to keep out of trouble.From different sources, Manco and Mortimer find out that the other is a bounty killer and are obviously chasing the same purpose. Manco tries to get Mortimer out of town by proving his gun skills by shooting at the Colonel's hat. But Mortimer proves his own worth and does exactly the same thing to Manco. Realizing they each have skills that would be ideal against fourteen men, and in order to get Indio ""between two fires"", they reluctantly form a partnership and decide that Manco should go undercover with the outlaws. He rescues one of Indio's friends from prison and is quickly offered membership into the gang.Indio sends Manco with a few of his men to rob the bank of Santa Cruz in order to be decoys and get the sheriff and his men away from El Paso. Manco kills the men he is sent with and uses a false telegraphic alarm as the decoy instead. Manco arrives in El Paso to bring Indio down with Mortimer but the plan goes wrong and the gang successfully rob the bank and take off with the loot. Manco tries to sever his ties with Mortimer but Mortimer convinces him otherwise. However, when Manco joins back up with Indio, he convinces him not to go in the direction that the Colonel planned.The gang arrive in the small border town of Agua Caliente, where Manco is surprised to find Mortimer waiting for him. The Hunchback recognizes the Colonel from their previous encounter and forces a showdown in which he is killed by the Colonel. The Colonel then proves his worth to Indio by cracking open the safe without using explosives, but Indio states his intention to wait a month if necessary to allow the furor over the bank robbery to die down and locks the money away in a chest in the treasure room.That night, Manco and the Colonel meet in the treasure room and plan to steal the bank money from Indio. The Colonel had already taken the money out of the chest earlier and now locks it again with his special ability to open and lock locks without keys. When they leave the treasure room by roof (because the door is locked) they realize that the bandits are outside waiting for them, knowing that Manco is actually a bounty killer and that the Colonel is his cooperator. Just before Manco jumps down, he throws the bag with the money in a tree unnoticed. When Manco and the Colonel have climbed down, Indio's band severely beat them. Afterwards, Indio finds out that the chest is still locked, which makes him believe that Manco and the Colonel never stole the money.Later that night, Indio's right-hand man Niño (Mario Brega), on orders from Indio, kills the guard of Manco and the Colonel and releases them. Indio blames their escape on Cuchillo (Aldo Sambrell) and kills him. He informs his gang and sends them after the escaped bounty hunters. He intends to kill off his gang with the bounty killers while he and Niño take all the loot for themselves. However, by morning, the smarter Groggy (Luigi Pistilli) has figured out what Indio is up to, and kills Niño. He forces Indio to open the chest, revealing it is emptied. Indio convinces Groggy to join forces with him to trap the bounty killers.Meanwhile, Manco and Mortimer shoot down the gang, one by one, in the streets of the town. Standing alone, Mortimer shoots Groggy when the outlaw tries to run for it, but then has his gun shot out of his hand by Indio, who then takes out his pocket watch and begins playing it to start off a duel. As the chime nears the end, Manco suddenly appears with an identical pocket watch, playing the same tune as Indio's, which Mortimer realizes had been taken from him earlier. As this happens, Manco points a Henry rifle at Indio and gives his gun belt and pistol to Mortimer, evening the odds. ""Now we start,"" Manco announces, and sits while Mortimer and Indio face off. During the stand-off, Manco looks down at the pocket watch and sees the same picture of the woman Indio had raped. The music finishes, and Mortimer outdraws and guns down Indio.At this juncture, Mortimer takes Indio's pocket watch. Manco gives him back the other watch and remarks on a family resemblance; the Colonel replies, ""Naturally, between brother and sister,"" indicating that the young woman's portrait was that of Mortimer's sister. His revenge complete, he decides to take no part of the bounty. As Manco tosses the last of the bodies into a wagon and counts them by the reward for each one, he realizes he is short of the $27,000 total, and spins around to gun down Groggy who had survived and waited in ambush. As he leaves, he takes the bag with the bank money out of the tree, though it is not clear whether he intends to return it. Manco then rides off into the distance with his horse towing the wagon full of the lifeless bodies of the entire gang."
The Sons of Katie Elder,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059740/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ranch owner Katie Elder's four sons determine to avenge the murder of their father and the swindling of their mother. The Elder boys return to Clearwater, Texas for their Mother's funeral. John, the eldest, is a well-known gunfighter and trouble follows him wherever he goes. The boys try to get their ranch back from the town's gunsmith who won it from their father in a card game, after which he was murdered. Troubles come, however, just because they carry the Elder name.—anonymous A steam engine pulls its cars through a mountainous canyon and on into the Clearwater Station, at Clearwater, Texas. Sheriff Billy Wilson (Paul Fix) and his deputy, Ben Latta (Jeremy Slate), along with Tom Elder (Dean Martin), Bud Elder (Michael Anderson, Jr.), and Matt Elder (Earl Holliman), were all waiting. Tom attempts to get his brothers to bet with him on exactly how close to a spot on the platform the train will stop. They refuse, disgusted that Tom would think of gambling when they were there for a funeral.The only passenger who disembarks is a rough looking character, unknown to any of them. The man asks the sheriff where the town was and the sheriff points down the road. saying, ""you can't miss it."" Tom, Matt, and Bud get on their horses and ride away, figuring whomever it was they were expecting had decided not to come.At a ranch outside Clearwater, one of the buildings is marked, ""Hastings Firearms Manufacturing."" Gun shots ring out. Morgan Hastings (James Gregory), the owner of the ranch and the firearms manufacturing business, is sighting in a rifle. A man named Curley (George Kennedy), approaches Hastings. Curley is the man who came in on the train that afternoon.Hastings asks Curley if anyone else got off the train. He is specifically interested in whether John Elder (John Wayne) might have come to town. Curley says he doesn't know John Elder, but has heard of him and figures Hastings must be afraid of John Elder and therefore decided to hire him (Curley is a gunfighter). Hastings tells Curley that he may not need to use his gun at all and may very well be on his way out of town in a few days without having to do anything. Curley doesn't care, as long as he gets paid. He takes his saddlebags and bedroll and goes to set up quarters in the ranch house.Sheriff Wilson and Ben return to town and walk to their office, passing the church and a horse-drawn hearse being tended to by the local undertaker. The sheriff removes his gun belt, but the deputy keeps his on. The sheriff wants to know why the deputy plans to wear his gun to the funeral, since John Elder didn't get off the train, and there shouldn't be any trouble. The deputy knows that John could still show up, and he's also concerned about the stranger, Curley, who did get off the train. Sheriff Wilson cautions Ben that John Elder isn't wanted for anything around there. Ben reminds the sheriff that just being a gunfighter puts John on the opposite side of the law, just as the sheriff had taught him in the first place.The funeral is for Katie Elder. She is being laid to rest next to her husband, Bass, who preceded her in death by about six months. As the ceremony at the gravesite comes to an end, John Elder can be seen observing from high in the nearby rocks.One of the local men approaches the Elder brothers and tells them that Katie once sold him a blind horse and really suckered him good. He seems to admire that Katie, a woman, had fooled him like that. A young woman with a baby in her arms steps up next and tells the brothers that the baby's name is Katie, named after their mother.The parson speaks to the three brothers, asking them if one of them is missing. They confirm that the oldest brother, John, is not there. The parson is upset that he couldn't have delivered better words about Katie, even though the brothers tell him he delivered a very good eulogy. He tells them it wasn't good enough, that she deserved much more, but then he doesn't expect the brothers to understand that.After everyone has left the gravesite, the undertaker motions to four boys and they prepare to lower the coffin into the ground. After they're gone, John Elder comes to the grave and pauses to reflect and pay his respects. He's observed from afar by Curley.As John stands there, holding his hat, he hears a noise behind him. He whirls around and at the same time, flings his hat and draws his gun. The hat strikes Sheriff Billy in the chest, and John aims his pistol at Billy. John pauses, acknowledging the sheriff, then admonishes him for coming up behind him quietly like that. Billy asks John why he came into town the back way. John tells him that he wanted to avoid any trouble, and there's always somebody looking for trouble.The sheriff asks John how long he plans to be around. John wonders if there's some reason he should be in a hurry to move on. Billy tells John there are several reasons why he shouldn't stick around: 1) you don't belong here anymore, 2) there's another man new to town, a hired gun, and 3) my deputy is very conscientious about his job. John suggests that Billy send Ben over to run that new guy out of town, but Billy has to admit that he doesn't know the man, much less if he is wanted for anything.John tells the sheriff that he just wants to see his mother buried and to visit his brothers, then he'll leave. The sheriff is fine with that, and points the direction that John should go to see his brothers. John points the opposite direction and says, ""but the ranch is over there,"" and Billy tells him that the family doesn't live on the old ranch anymore, that the ranch now belongs to Morgan Hastings.Billy tells John that his pa was killed about six months ago, and he hasn't been able to find out who did it. Sensing that John probably wants to find out who did it, Billy cautions John not to do anything foolish, but when John says, ""You've been trying real hard not to tell me something, Billy. What is it?"" Billy just turns and walks away.Curley rushes to see Hastings and tell him that John Elder was there after all. Hastings tells Curley that if anything happens, such as a gunfight, that Curley should make it look like self-defense. He tells Curley to do nothing, unless and until he tells him to. Hastings' son, Dave (Dennis Hopper), witnesses the conversation and becomes very upset, realizing that the Elder boys are likely to start asking questions about how the Hastings came into ownership of the ranch.John rides out to the Lupin place, where his mother was living when she died and where his brothers are staying. At the ranch house, Bud, who was very young when John left, is asking Tom and Matt if John is as fast as everyone says he is. Tom tells him that when John was younger, he was so fast, that it was scary. Tom realizes that Bud is thinking he'd like to be like his oldest brother, so he advises Bud to consider some other line of work, such as gambling, which is much safer than gun fighting. Just as Bud is wishing John had come for the funeral, Matt looks out the window and says, ""He's here,"" and they go outside to meet him.The brothers all greet one another jovially. John learns that Bud is supposed to return for his second year of college, something Katie had always very much wanted him to do. John asks how their mother died. Bud tells him that Doctor Isdell told them that she just wore herself out, had a stroke, and lost the ability to talk. That's when the preacher wrote the letters to John.Matt says he came back to see Katie about three years ago. Tom accuses Matt of hitting her up for money to put into his hardware business. Matt says at least he came back to see her, which is more than Tom or John did.Bud asks John if it's true what they say about him. He specifically wants to know how many men John has killed. John is saved from having to answer by the sounds of a wagon coming up to the house. It is Mary Gordon (Martha Hyer), bringing a picnic basket of food for the brothers. Mary operates the boarding house in town. She tells John that she was the skinny little kid who used to live next door to the Mastersons. She tells the brothers that Katie asked her to look in on them, if they bothered to come to the funeral.Mary tells the brothers that their mother always talked about how proud she was of all of them, how they sent her money regularly, and how they were helping put Bud through college. Mary observes that their mother thus lied about them all the time. She says Katie blamed Texas for taking her older three boys away from her, but she wasn't going to let Bud fall prey. She said she'd see Bud through college, or die. She died.There's a rocking chair in the house that Mary said was given to Katie by her husband, Bass, and she wouldn't have swapped it for a diamond ring. Bass had his faults, but Katie loved him dearly. John thanks Mary for being so nice to their mother, but Mary responds, much like the parson did, by criticizing the brothers for not treating Katie better. She then storms out of the house. When John chases her down and starts to say something, she looks at him somewhat in disgust and says, ""I see you're still wearing that gun."" Then she flips the reins and drives off.Bud tells his brothers that he didn't want to go to college, but it was that or jail. He explained that he was accused of stealing a horse, when all he did was go for a ride on it. His mother wanted him to go to college, so she wouldn't back him up on his claim of innocence about the horse. The college he was sent to was the Colorado School of Mines in Colorado Springs.John begins wondering why Katie would sell 1,200 acres of the best land in the area, after Bass died. Regardless of the reason, Matt figures there must be money in the bank from the sale of the ranch, so he wants to go check that out and divide the money four ways. That leads to a discussion about Bud going back to college, to which he says he's not going. He plans to ride with John. John says, ""There's one little thing you're forgetting. You ain't been invited."" Tom says he'd take Bud with him, but he doesn't know where he is going, just that it won't be anyplace he's already been.As the brothers prepare to go to the bank, John pauses, while looking at his mother's rocking chair, then hangs his gun belt on the coat hook, leaving it behind. In town, John fires off orders to his brothers, sending them to the funeral parlor, the general store and the doctor's office to see if there are any debts that needed to be settled for Katie.Tom and Bud go first to see Mr. Peevey (Percy Helton) at the general store. Katie owed $6.20 to Mr. Peevey. Tom offers to settle things by cutting a deck of cards, with the high card winning, and the wager being double or nothing. Peevey just laughs, then walks over to the bottom of a staircase and calls out to his mother. He wants to know how much they owed Katie Elder for some dresses and guitar lessons she'd provided. The total comes to $11, so he pays Tom $4.80. Tom is curious as to why Peevey's mother would need guitar lessons, so Peevey explains that he thought his mother could play guitar in the saloon and make some extra money.John goes to see the undertaker, Henry Hyselman (John Doucette), who tells him that Katie pre-paid her funeral by giving him a gray horse. John asks if that was the same gray horse that Bud stole. Hyselman laughs and admits that he and Katie rigged that whole matter up to scare Bud into going to college. John then asks Henry if he buried their father. Henry says yes. He then tells John about the time Thad challenged Bass to a duel. Bass had the choice of weapons, so he chose Roman candles, since it was the 4th of July. No one got hurt, although one of the fireballs went down Bass' pants and he had to sit down in the watering trough. John and Henry have a good laugh about that.John then asks how Bass died. Henry becomes very uncomfortable but admits that it was obvious Bass had been shot in the back. He didn't have any idea who did it, or if anyone tried to find out.Hastings is standing inside his gun business, there in town, across from Hyselman's business, with Curley and another of his men, wondering what John is doing talking to Hyselman for so long. Curley asks Hastings if he wants him to go ask. Hastings thinks that's a good idea, but insists that Curley do nothing more than talk.John reunites with his brothers and they walk over to see Mr. Vennar (James Westerfield), the banker. Mr. Vennar isn't any more cordial to the brothers than most anyone else in town. He said there wasn't even $1 left in Katie's bank account. He said she scraped together what she needed through doing sewing and giving guitar lessons. He told the brothers that if they bothered to look in her closet, they'd find one blue dress for winter and one gray dress for summer. That's all she had for clothes. The Lupin place didn't belong to her either. The bank allowed her and Bud to live there so they'd have a roof over their heads. Katie insisted on paying rent, nevertheless.Mr. Vennar dismisses the brothers, but not before Matt asks about the money for sale of the Elder's ranch. Vennar says he didn't know anything about the sale of the ranch, and any records that may have existed were destroyed in a recent fire. He added that he couldn't remember every transaction. As John leaves, he pauses, looks back at Vennar and says, ""Every transaction, or just this one?"" and then he turns and leaves.Curley walks over to see Mr. Hyselman, demanding to know what he and John Elder were talking about. Hyselman tells him it's none of his business. Curley says that Mr. Hastings wants to know. Hyselman says he doesn't care what Mr. Hastings wants and tells Curley to leave. Curley grabs Hyselman and forces his head into a large vat of water. John comes walking through the entrance just about then, sees what's happening, looks around, then grabs an ax handle that is sitting nearby. He yells ""Hey!"" to Curley, and when Curley looks up, John swings the ax handle flush across Curley's face, knocking him down and out.Hyselman catches his breath and tells John that he thinks the bad guy works for Morgan Hastings and was trying to find out what they'd been talking about. He further explains how Hastings is bent upon trying to take over the entire county and has already acquired the Elders' old place. John hands Curley's pistol to Hyselman, then offers money to Henry to look after Katie's grave. Henry refuses the money, telling John it would be his pleasure to do it. John thanks him and, after one last glance at the unconscious Curley, he leaves.John tells his brothers that he wants to go out and look at the old home place, telling them he's ""homesick."" As they ride up on a ridge overlooking the ranch, Matt recalls the times they used to play in the barn. Bud claims to remember Tom falling out of the loft and breaking his leg. Tom tells Bud he wasn't even born yet when that happened and says he didn't fall, that someone pushed him. He says someone was always pushing him out of that loft. John says, ""That's because you bounced so good. Everybody in the family kept bragging about how good you bounced.""They ride on down to the house and John knocks on the door. Dave Hastings answers and he's very agitated. He tells John that they are on private property, that his father isn't there, and they should just leave. Deputy Ben Latta comes riding up right then and asks Dave if there's trouble. Dave tells the deputy that he ordered the Elders to leave and they refused. Ben is already on edge, having learned of how John roughed up Curley in town, and he says he won't stand for any more trouble.Latta tells the Elders to leave or be arrested. When John says they wouldn't take too kindly to being arrested, Latta draws his gun. Tom, sitting on his horse next to Latta, is able to jump over and knock the deputy off his horse. John grabs the deputy's gun. Tom jumps up and says, ""See, now we ain't arrested."" Latta tells them they are in trouble for resisting arrest. John tells him they are all going back into town with him, to straighten things out, but they aren't going in looking guilty. He orders Latta to get on his horse and looks back at Dave and tells him that they'll be back.They all ride into town, Latta in the lead, the brothers riding side-by-side behind him. They explain what happened to Sheriff Wilson and the sheriff tells Latta that next time, he should wait until he's told to go after somebody before he goes riding off. Sheriff Wilson tells the Elders to take off, but John and Tom follow him into his office, wanting to talk to him.John and Tom ask Billy questions about their father and the ranch. Billy says that Hastings told him Bass lost the ranch to him while gambling. There were six witnesses to the event. Billy figures Bass must have been pretty drunk to lose his ranch in a card game. When they find out Bass was shot the same night that he lost the ranch, John says, ""Well, now wouldn't you say that was a little coincidental, Billy?"" Billy just says nothing could be proven. They offer to help Billy figure out who shot Bass, but Billy wants them to let it go, and to stop digging around because it will just result in trouble.John decides they should go see Hastings next. On the way, he sees Mary getting some things out of a box on her wagon. He approaches her and tells her that the brothers would like her to have any of Katie's things that she thinks she'd like to have, such as the rocking chair. Mary thanks him and says she'd like that very much. John tells her he'd bring them by. Tom notices a mutual attraction between John and Mary and accuses John of forcing himself on Mary.John and Tom go into Hasting's gun shop, where Hastings is showing off a couple of dueling pistols to Bondie Adams (Rodolfo Acosta) and Curley. Strangely enough, there are no marks on Curley's face, so apparently, he was a fast healer.Hastings expresses condolences to John and Tom about their mother and tells them that after Bass died, he offered to pay Katie for the ranch, out of a sense of guilt. He admits that he needed the ranch for its water supply, to power a mill and help the town grow. He believed the town could become important. John asks to see the paper that transferred the ranch. Hastings shows it to him. He then asks if the six witnesses who signed the transfer all worked for Hastings. Hastings said that they did. John then asks what the game was that he and Bass were playing when they bet on the ranch. Hastings says it was blackjack. John looks at Tom and recalls that Bass used to say that he'd shoot any of his kids he caught playing blackjack, and that he thought it was a woman's game.Tom asks Hastings who he thinks the low down dirty rat was that shot their pa. When Hastings says, ""Why ask me?"" John says, ""Well, we aim to find out,"" and he and Tom leave. Outside, Tom reminds John that they started playing blackjack when they were 3 or 4 years old. John says, ""Yeah, we know that, but Hastings doesn't.""Back at the ranch, the brothers sort through Katie's belongings, burning papers that aren't of use anymore. John takes a worn bible from the closet and reads the following entries:
""Katie Dwayne; born Ohio, no date; married Bass Elder, September 8, 1850, Clearwater, Texas.""John says they better keep that bible. Tom jumps up and asks why. He thinks they should raffle it, and maybe give half the money to the parson.Matt thinks they should get a nice stone for their mother's grave. They then argue about what to get, perhaps a marble statuette, say of an angel, or a lamb. Then Tom suggests it be a marble horse and the others are aghast. John asks what's become of all of them. He tells them that their mother just wanted one of them to amount to something, and they still had a chance to do that, with Bud and college.Bud again argues that he doesn't want to be the monument to his mother. He wants to be a gunfighter, like John, and for them to be famous like the Dalton brothers. John tells him the Dalton brothers were dead, that they were hung. Bud just says, ""Oh.""John finally proclaims, ""We keep the book!""John rides into town, after dark, carrying the rocking chair and the picnic basket that Mary had brought out earlier. He takes it into the boarding house, says hello to Mary, and places the rocker in front of the fireplace. He also hands her Katie's bible. She doesn't feel right taking the family bible, but he insists, so she tells him he can have it back whenever he wants it.Mary goes to a drawer and takes out a bundle of letters that she hands to John. They were the letters he'd written to Katie long ago. She had let Mary read them. Mary said she had noticed from the letters how John changed over time, even though Katie didn't.Mary asks John if he's trying to find out who killed his father. He says yes, that whoever shot him most likely also stole the ranch, so it's the least he could do for his mother. Mary tells him that killing Bass' murderer would just be another bad example for Bud, showing him what a big tough guy his big brother is, and how shooting people is worthy of worship. She tells John that Katie just wanted Bud to go to college and make the Elder name stand for something. John gets upset and throws the letters into the fireplace. He starts to walk out, but turns back when she thanks him again for the rocking chair and bible. He asks Mary why Katie wouldn't want him to find Bass' killer. She tells him because it would result in more killing, and Katie hated killing.Tom and Bud go into the bar and Tom asks Bud for some money to buy drinks. Bud doesn't have any money and suggests that Tom use his own money. Tom is insulted, saying that their father would come out of his grave if Tom used his own money to buy a drink. Nevertheless, he buys them each one shot of whiskey, then sets out to demonstrate to Bud how to go about avoiding paying for any more drinks. He puts on a black eye patch and pretends to remove one of his eyes, revealing a glass eye in the palm of his hand. He says it's worth $22. He calls out to the bar patrons that he's conducting a raffle for the glass eye. The bartender tells Tom that if he wants a drink that bad, he'd give him one, but Tom refuses and continues with the raffle.Tom sells $10 worth of chances on the glass eye, then puts 9 white chips and 1 blue chip in a hat. Each man who bought chances draws out a chip. Jeb Ross (Strother Martin) bought two chances, so on his second draw, he comes up with the blue chip and wins the eye. Tom immediately offers to buy the eye back from Jeb, for $3, which would give Ross a profit of $2. Ross says no, so Tom says he needs the eye in order to get married, because his girl doesn't like his eye patch. Ross considers, and after the rest of the men encourage him to return the eye, he asks Tom for $5. Tom says, ""split the difference and I'll buy you a drink."" Jeb agrees and it's a deal.When Tom puts the glass eye back in it's little carrying case, Ross asks him why he doesn't put it back in his skull. Tom lifts the eye patch and says, ""it'd be a little crowded in there,"" as he moves both of his eyes back and forth. Everyone roars with laughter at the joke.Curley is also in the saloon, playing cards. He decides to confront Tom, telling him he didn't think his little trick was funny, then calling Tom a liar and a cheat, just like his old man. Tom steps back and assumes a position for drawing his gun. Bud jumps in and calls Curley a liar for the things he said about Bass. Curley decides Bud's words are fighting words and orders someone to give Bud a gun. Bondie Adams offers his gun, sliding it along the bar towards Bud. Before Bud can grab the gun, Tom grabs him in a bear hug. Right then, John enters the bar and Bud tells him, ""This guy just called pa a liar and a drunk."" Bud, suddenly feeling even more emboldened, then asks Curley if the invitation to draw goes for Johnny Elder as well.John tells Tom to get Bud out of the bar. Bud refuses to go until Curley pays for what he said. John looks at Bud and pauses, then tells Bud that their father really was a liar and a drunk, upon which he grabs Bud and pushes him sharply towards the door and tells Tom to keep him out. John eyes the pistol on the bar and Curley starts giggling. Sheriff Wilson then appears on the scene, carrying a shotgun. He points it at Curley and tells John to get out. John leaves. When Curley and his co-horts begin to walk out, the sheriff tells them to stay and finish their game.The next morning at breakfast, Bud throws a fit, as he's upset about the way Curley talked about their father, and he thinks big brother John slinked away from the fight like a low-life skunk. John tells him to shut up. When Bud tells John that he should have let him fight Curley, John tells him that Curley would have killed him before his hand got halfway to that gun. John tells Bud that Katie wanted him to go to college and that's what he's going to do. Bud acknowledges that his big brother might be able to force him to go, but he couldn't make him learn anything.Bud rushes to a cabinet and extracts a pistol, telling his brothers that he is going after Curley and asking if any of them are coming with him. John grabs the pistol away from Bud, then backhands him across the face. When Bud tries to throw a punch back at him, John takes the punch against his hand and flings Bud back across the room. He then tosses the pistol onto the table, accidentally knocking a cup of coffee over into Tom's lap. Tom jumps up and punches John. John hits him back, knocking him towards Matt. Matt sort of pushes Tom, who then turns and punches Matt. Matt then hits Tom. After that, there are many more punches delivered and received among all the brothers, until John gets knocked through the front door and raises up to see a man in a wagon sitting there.The man and John exchange ""howdys,"" then the man says he's looking for Kate Elder. When he learns that Kate has died, he expresses his condolences, then explains how she wrote to him about a month ago. He produces the letter, addressed to Mr. Charlie Bob Striker (Rhys Williams), Pecos, TX. In the letter, Kate offers to purchase between 100-200 horses from Mr. Striker, if he's willing to sell them to her on credit and allow her time to resell them so she could pay him what's owed.Charlie figures there will be no deal now, since Katie had passed, and he is all set to leave when John tells him that he'd be interested in taking the 200 horses. He said he'd run them up to Colorado and sell them to the miners, but he'd need to also do it on credit. He offers Striker half the profits for trusting him. Striker asks the other brothers if they are going to be in on it. Tom and Matt say ok, as long as the profits go towards Bud's college. Bud hesitates, complaining that John almost broke his jaw. John says, ""I was trying awful hard too, but that's what it seems to take with some people."" After Tom nudges Bud, he agrees to go along.Striker says that as long as he was going to do a fool thing for their mother, he would go ahead and do it for them. He heads off for his ranch down near Pecos to wait for them. Ben Latta comes riding into town and stops to speak with Morgan Hastings. They go over to see Sheriff Wilson, who's at the jail playing chess with Judge Harry Evers (Sheldon Allman). He's lost eight games in a row to Harry. Ben thrusts a wanted poster at Billy. On the poster is a reproduction of Tom Elder, and he's wanted for murder. Ben tells him that Hastings put him on the trail of investigating Tom, and that's how he came upon the poster.After Judge Evers explains to Ben that the wanted poster doesn't mean Tom is guilty, just that's he's wanted, Billy cautions Ben that he's operating out of pure hate in his pursuit of the Elder brothers, and that's why they took Ben's gun from him the first time. Ben walks over to the gun rack and gets a rifle, then some bullets. He tells Billy he's going after Tom. Billy criticizes Ben for being so ready to get tough with Tom, advising him that it would be better to go out there as though he's reluctant to arrest Tom. Seeing that Ben can't be reasoned with, Billy decides he'll go out to the ranch on his own.Ben and Hastings can't believe Billy is willing to go by himself, and Hastings offers the services of Curley. Billy asks Hastings what it is he's trying to keep the Elders from finding out about. Hastings responds, ""Just trying to help.""Hastings beats Billy out to the ranch and lies in wait behind a tree on a hillside. When Billy rides up to the ranch house, Hastings shoots him in the back with a rifle. Billy's horse trots back to town, where Judge Evers sees him and tells Ben. Ben puts together a posse and they ride out to the ranch and find Billy still breathing, but barely alive. Two men are assigned to take Billy to the doctor. The rest of the posse head out to find the Elders.The Elder brothers have gone to Pecos and gathered the 200 horses. They are just starting out on the long drive to Colorado, pausing at the river to spend the night. John compliments Bud on his horse wrangling during the day and asks him where he learned to do that. Bud just says, ""Not in college!"" Another argument about his going to college ensues, and John complains to his other two brothers that he doesn't know what to do about Bud's continuing sassiness. Tom says to Bud, ""Ain't you got no respect for your elders?"" Bud says, ""Ha, ha, I've heard that before."" When he's told that Katie wouldn't have stood for his back talk, Bud asks which of them thought they were able to stand in for their mom and put him in his place.John, Tom and Matt then grab Bud and fling him into the river. Tom and Matt jump in too and douse him a couple of more times. When John tells them all that he thought he'd taught them better than to jump in the river with their clothes on, they grab him and pull him in.The next morning, Tom spots the posse on a nearby ridge. When he asks John what they should do, John says they haven't done anything wrong, so not to act like they have. They mount up and prepare to resume the drive, when Bondie Adams raises his rifle and shoots, spooking Bud's horse who bucks and knocks Bud out of the saddle. Ben yells at Bondie for disobeying orders, but the posse then rides on down to confront the Elders.John asks Ben what's going on. Ben infers they were stealing horses. John tells him they acquired the horses legally and could prove it, although he didn't expect them to believe him. He said Billy would believe him. That's when Ben accuses them of shooting Billy when he tried to bring Tom in, and he shows them the wanted poster. John glances at Tom, not understanding, but then tells Ben that it doesn't make sense that they'd be on the run with Tom, shoot Billy, stop to pick up 200 horses, then herd the horses back through Clearwater. Ben just tells them to throw their guns on the ground. John tells his brothers to comply, that more killings won't prove anything.The brothers are worried about their horses, but Ben doesn't seem to care about that, ordering his posse members to kill the Elders if they try to escape. In jail, Tom explains that some bartender in New Orleans got upset when he pulled his fake eye trick and started shooting at him, so he had to shoot back. He didn't think he'd get a fair trial, so he ran.Outside the jail, the men of the town have gathered and are talking about a lynch party for the Elders. Mary comes to see them, bringing food. John asks her about Billy, but she doesn't know his condition. When John suggests that she too thinks they shot Billy, she says she doesn't know what to think. She just wishes they'd gone away right after the funeral. Ben comes up and tells Mary to go home. He also says that Billy's dead. Matt asks if Billy said anything about who shot him. Ben says he wasn't able to say that the brothers didn't shoot him.Mary lashes out at Ben, telling him he needs to get the U.S. Marshall, or take the Elders to Laredo, because they won't get a chance to make their case there in Clearwater. Ben tells her to quit telling him how to do his job. It appears that Ben would just as soon let the towns people string up the brothers.Tom produces a knife he had hidden away and tells his brothers that come breakfast time in the morning, they'll get the key.Judge Evers confirms Mary's opinion, telling Ben that they wouldn't be able to find a jury capable of providing a fair trial for the Elders. Ben asks Charlie Biller (John Qualen), an older deputy, if they have enough ammunition to see them through. Charlie says no, that their guns won't stop that mob anyway. He complains to the judge that Billy could have dispersed that mob, and without using a gun. He doesn't think Ben amounts to a patch on Billy's shirt. He tells Ben he needs to get the Elders out of town, or pretty soon he'll be shooting bullets at the people who used to be his friends. Ben thinks about it and tells the judge they'll move the Elders to Laredo early the next morning.During the night, there seems to be some activity going on, as though Ben is going to open the cell door, so Bud wakes Tom, but no one comes. Tom gets his knife out and tells Bud to call out and tell the deputies that he's sick. John kicks the knife out of Tom's hand, telling him they're going to face the charges. He tells Tom that they landed in jail because he chose to run in New Orleans, but not now. Even if they all get killed, they aren't running, and that's a win for Katie. He throws the knife out the window.The deputies come to take the Elders to Laredo. The first stop is J. Plummer Blacksmith shop, where they have shackles put on. Bud refuses to be shackled to John, so Matt angrily shoves Bud out of the way and steps up to be shackled to John. The judge deputizes the additional men who will be transporting the Elders.In a canyon outside Clearwater, Morgan and Dave Hastings, Curley, and Bondie Adams are waiting in ambush. The three wagon drivers carrying the Elders and the deputies are part of the ambush plan, which is to kill everyone and blame the Elders. Ned, the driver of the wagon carrying the brothers, stops on a river crossing bridge, claiming it is to rest the horses. John senses something's up, and taps Matt on the shoulder, a signal to get ready. He leans forward as Ned stands up and shouts something, then pushes Ned out of the wagon while simultaneously grabbing the pistol from his holster. He shouts at his brothers to jump. John and Matt go off one side of the bridge and Tom and Bud go off the other.Hastings and his men start shooting. The man riding with Ben draws his gun and orders Ben to drop his rifle. John shoots back, but tells his brothers that he can't hold them off with one gun. Tom asks him if he can provide cover long enough for he and Bud to run back to Ben's wagon and get more guns. John says, ""three shots worth."" Tom and Bud get in the river and swim under water a short distance and get to the wagon. Ben has been taken off to the side by his captor, near some trees. Tom grabs a rifle and sees Ben and the other man. He shoots and hits the man, wounding him, and although he's still able to hold his pistol on Ben, he decides he'd better run for it.John yells at Tom to use the horses on the wagon for cover in getting back over to him and Matt. They make the short run to the bridge, then jump in the river with several rifles and boxes of ammo, and make their way over to John and Matt. Seeing all that, Hastings turns to Curley and says, ""All right, Curley, this is what you were hired for. I don't want one of them lizards to get out of here alive."" Bondie goes with Curley as they ride down to where the other men are, near the river. One man tells Curley that there's dynamite in his wagon.Things get real quiet while Curley and another man configure a bunch of dynamite sticks into a bomb. The Elders decide to fall back a bit, to the other side of the bridge, but before they can, Curley yells go and six of the men charge, shooting at the Elders while Curley lights the fuse and tosses the bomb under the bridge, then they all fall back. Things get quiet again and John hears the sizzling of the fuse. When he sees the bomb, he yells, ""look out!"" as he dives into the water. The dynamite goes off, causing the bridge to collapse.When John struggles up out of the water, he finds Matt on his back with a large splinter of timber in his stomach. Matt tries to say something about a wish that he has, but he dies before he can say it. Curley and his gang all start shooting again. Ben is nearby, but helpless to do anything. John grabs two pistols and furiously empties them at the bad guys, but doesn't hit anybody. Then he grabs a rifle and shoots some more. He finally calms down a bit and waits for Curley to stick his face out from behind the tree he was hiding behind, then shoots him in the head.After seeing Curley go down, another man breaks from behind his tree and runs. John cuts him down too. Bud is hit in the upper left chest and freaks out. Tom tends to him while John shoots his shackle to release him from Matt. Ben comes out of hiding and calls out to the Elders to throw him a gun and he'd help them. Hastings calls Ben a ""stupid fool"" and prepares to shoot him, but Dave grabs his arm and pulls his gun down. Hastings knocks Dave down and re-aims at Ben. As Ben leaps for the pistol that John flings to him, his body is violently jerked backwards by the force of the bullet from Hasting's rifle.When the remaining men see Hastings turning to leave, they all decide it's time to go as well. John and Tom shoot at them as they leave, but don't hit anybody. Tom wants to run, but John tells him that Bud needs a doctor and he's using the one wagon to take him to Clearwater. John drives the buckboard into Clearwater at full speed, going right to the blacksmith's shop. He tells Tom to get Bud in the barn, while he provides cover. One man across the street is about to start shooting, but the judge stops him.Will, the blacksmith, tells his son, who is there working with him, to get out of there, but John tells the boy to go get Dr. Isdell and be quick about it. The boy goes for the doctor while John orders the blacksmith to take off their leg irons. One man stops the boy, but Judge Evers tells him to let him go. Evers then approaches the blacksmith's shop and John fires off a shot, telling him to stop. Evers tells John to send out Will and they'll let the doctor come through. John says it will have to be the other way around.John explains what happened at the bridge outside town, and also quickly relates the brothers' alibi for the time when Billy was shot and killed. He tells Evers to send for the U.S. Marshal in Laredo and they'd give themselves up to him. Evers sends Dr. Isdell into the barn. Tom releases the blacksmith. Evers orders all the men gathered around to break it up and go home, or they'd have to answer to the U.S. Marshal.Dr. Isdell does what he can for Bud, suggesting to John and Tom that they get the boy over to the boarding house as soon as possible. John then opens the door so the doctor can leave. Tom assures John that Bud will pull through and they'll see to it that he gets raised right.Hastings and his son are anxiously waiting over in the gun shop. Dave is worried that one of the deputies will tell the U.S. Marshal what happened. Morgan doesn't think so. He gets upset at his son's lighting up a cigarette in the shop, where's there's gunpowder, and forcibly smashes the cigarette against his son's mouth. Dave goes outside to smoke and pout. Tom sees him and calls to John. Tom wants to go get Dave, ask him some questions. John says no, that if Tom steps outside, he'd be killed. John then goes to tend to Bud.Tom sets down his rifle and takes a pistol, climbs into the loft, and goes out a window. On the street, he takes a horse to provide cover as he crosses the road. He manages to avoid detection by several men he passes and makes his way over to the gun shop. He comes up behind Dave and puts his gun in his back, ordering him to walk backwards. Morgan sees Dave's strange movement through the window and realizes something's amiss. He goes to the side door and sees Tom pointing his gun at Dave. Morgan breaks a pane of glass in the door with his pistol and fires, hitting Tom in the middle of his back. Tom is wounded, but returns fire and is able to keep going, ordering Dave to move. Morgan follows and more shots are exchanged, but Morgan decides to give up the chase as Tom nears the blacksmith shop and the towns people start gathering again, attracted by the sounds of gunfire.Tom pushes Dave into the barn and says to John, ""here's a present for ya, now get your answers."" John proceeds to interrogate Dave, asking who it was that ambushed them outside of town. When Dave says he doesn't know, John hits him twice, then starts choking him. Morgan appears at another doorway and witnesses what's going on. He again breaks a pane of glass and fires off a shot, but he hits his son, as John had spun Dave, putting him between him and the door.As Dave stumbles forward, telling his father that he didn't tell them anything, John quickly grabs his rifle. Morgan starts to withdraw, only Judge Evers shows up and draws down on Hastings, ordering him to drop his gun. Hastings quickly tries to explain that the Elders shot at him, and had his son in there. As Evers opens the door to the barn, Hastings runs off.Before he dies, Dave tells John that his father killed Ben, that Bass Elder found out he was being cheated, so Hastings killed him too, and that Billy kept getting closer to the truth, so he had to go as well. Judge Evers hears all of it, then orders John to give up his gun, telling John that they'd take care of Hastings. John says, ""I don't want any trouble with you, Harry."" Tom says, ""I wouldn't argue with him,"" just before he topples over face first, unconscious.Harry tries once more to stop John, but he tells Harry that he has to do this for himself and, as he walks out, tells Harry to go get Dr. Isdell for Tom.John marches directly over towards the gun shop, but pauses when the lights start to dim. He sneaks up and kicks the front door open. Hastings fires off some shots at him. John dives into the store and takes cover near some barrels of gunpowder. They exchange more shots, but realizing they are in a bit of a standoff, John decides to position a smaller container of explosive out in the middle of the floor, then he dives out the side door and runs back around to the front. While standing in the street, he fires a shot into that container, causing it to explode. The entire store then blows up.John turns and hands his gun to Judge Evers, then slowly walks towards the blacksmith shop. Mary calls out to him and he turns and walks to her. She tells him that Bud is in the boarding house. She says doc told her that Bud would require lots of care. John tells her he'll get it. He asks about Tom. She says the doctor was with him now, but that Tom said it would take more than one bullet to kill him. As John follows Mary to go see Bud, he pushes against Katie's rocking chair, putting it in motion.The end."

A wagon train heads for Denver with a cargo of whisky for the miners. Chaos ensues as the Temperance League, the US cavalry, the miners and the local Indians all try to take control of the valuable cargo.—Steve Crook <steve@brainstorm.co.uk> The film opens with a narrator using a documentary style description of the events of November 1867. He tells us there were all indications that it will be a hard winter and citizens of Denver are concerned about the lack of whiskey in town. A bad winter might close the mountain passes leaving the city dry until late spring. A group of miners and saloon owners consult scout 'Oracle' Jones (Donald Pleasence) about what to do. Fortified with some whiskey he has a vision of them pooling all their liquor needs into one big order and getting a reliable company to agree to an iron clad contact to get the alcohol to Denver before snow closes the trails.Back east, businessman Frank Wallingham (Brian Keith) storms into the local newspaper office to confront Editor Hobbes (Whit Bissell). The newspaper has printed the story that Wallingham will be shipping 40 wagons of liquor to Denver and Wallingham is concerned that the publicity will attract Indians, or even worse, government tax revenue agents. He tells the editor that as he has every penny he has tied up in the train and he intends to accompany it personally to Denver and ask for an army escort from Fort Russell to protect him along the trail. The editor, annoyed at Wallingham, decides to send a telegram about the wagon train to the well-known, temperance leader Cora Templeton Massingale (Lee Remick), who is currently visiting Fort Russell.Despite the editors observation to Wallingham that ""Indians don't read newspapers"" word of the wagon train quickly spreads to the Native Americans in the area.

Some of the other troops get involved by punctuating the music with cannon fire.Gearhart, returning to the Fort, hears the shouting, bugles and cannon fire and assumes the Fort is under attack and arrives in full assault mode. When he finds it is just Massingale and her followers, he is peeved and orders Slater to report to him at his quarters. He is even more peeved when he finds Slater and his daughter are already alone in his quarters making out. Louise admits to her father that she was purposely distracting Slater so that he would not shut down the rally.Gearhart finally gets to settle down to a bath when Massingale storms into his quarters after getting the telegram about the Wallingham wagon train. Gearhart is clearly irked about having this 30ish, good-looking female invade his domain, but she tells him that to a woman that has already been windowed twice, seeing a man in a bath is no big deal. She demands that Gearhart deny the request for escort. Gearhart replies that Wallingham is a ""taxpayer and a good Republican"" and he cannot refuse his request for help. The next day Slater is sent with a company of troops to intercept the wagon train and give it escort.In Denver the miners become concerned about reports that the Indians may attack the wagon train and consult Jones again. He has a vision of a Miner's Militia that goes out to escort the train back and they set out along the trail.The wagon train is having some trouble too as Wallingham has hired Irish teamsters to drive the last 10 of his wagons and their leader, Kevin O'Flaherty (Tom Stern), is constantly hitting him with labor demands and threats to go out on strike.Persuaded by his daughter, Gearhart agrees to let Massingale use the mess hall for a goodbye speech. There Massingale declares that she intends to go to Denver to stop the train. Louise declares that she will go with her and the rest of the women at the rally decide to go too.Gearhart decides he had no choice but to escort the women to Denver, if for no other reason than to get rid of Massingale. Problems develop the first night on the trail when the women, having brought bath tubs with them, decide to bath in the nude and his troops climb the nearby trees hoping to catch a glimpse. Gearhart, annoyed by this development, storms over to Massingale and catches her in mid-bath (much as she did with him several days before). He is even more annoyed when she tells him her plans have changed and she has decided to meet the wagon train on the trail, and not in Denver. He tells her he will not escort her to the wagon train as he fears the women may try and stop it by throwing their bodies in front of the wagons.Gearhart realizes that he cannot let the women go without any protection, however, so he develops a strategy of ""detached contact"" where his company secretly follows the women at a distance.All this activity comes to a head one morning at what the narrator tells us is the ""Battle of Whiskey Hills."" The Indians decide to break into three groups, attack the wagon train, draw off the guard and steal several wagons. That same morning, however, the wagon train traveling west escorted by Slater's patrol will run into the Miner's Militia, heading North; the Massingale group, headed South-East; and Gearhart's company, also headed South-East. The Indians will attack from the North.Unfortunately, to make things worse, the morning of the attack is subject to a horrific, blinding sand storm and total confusion reigns. The Indians cannot see the sunrise, and cannot coordinate their attacks. Groups race by each other in the storm, perplexed by not finding who they are expecting to see. Bullets fly everywhere and finally each group, including the Indians, hunker down in a circle while they fire at each other blindly.When the storm clears Gearhart is amazed to find that despite the rampant gunfire, nobody has been killed. He holds a conference with all parties. While the motives of most are clear, the Indians state (through a translator) that they were peacefully hunting buffalo when they were drawn into the incident. They state that after they are given presents, they will go home. Unfortunately this is mistranslated and Gearhart thinks the Indians are offering him a gift. He tells them thank you, but no thanks, and sends them on their way.The Indians, however, keep following the group which is now composed of both units of the cavalry, the whiskey train, the womans group and the miners militia. Gearhart calls another meeting where he gets Jones to translate and realizes that the Indians are the ones who want presents, most likely some firewater. Gearhart tells them to go home, but they keep following.As they near a swampy area known as ""Quicksand Bottoms,"" Jones has a vision and directs Wallingham to camp the train next to the marsh for the night. At the same time the Irish teamsters, encouraged by Massingale, go on strike removing 10 wagons from the train. Willingham wants to take the wagons back by force, but Gearhart sees this as a labor dispute and threatens to use his troops to keep the peace.That night about 30 of the women go to a camp meeting with the Indians and get them to sign temperance pledges (though there is some doubt that the Indians know what they are signing). In the middle of the meeting the Indians take the women hostage and tell Gearhart they will not release them unless they get 20 of the Wallingham wagons. This is eventually bargained down to 10, the exact number held by the Irish Teamsters and Gearhart decides to make the exchange to save the womens lives.As it is illegal to give firewater to Indians, this will ruin Gearhart's career. Massingale comes to Gearhart's tent distraught about her part in this and asking his forgiveness. She breaks her own rule, drinks a few shots of whiskey and she and Gearhart have a tender moment.Wallingham is upset by these events but Jones comes to him with a way out. Jones knows a secret way across quicksand bottoms that can be used by the train to escape the rest of the group. During the night he has marked the path with sticks flagged with red strips from his underwear. While the 10 wagons are being exchanged with the Indians, the rest of the wagon train will slip away, pull up the flags as they go, and be in Denver before anybody knows what happened.The exchange is arranged for dawn the next day. The Indians will release three women for every wagon they get. At the last minute O'Flaherty confides in Massingale that the bottles in the 10 wagons aren't whiskey, but warm, volatile champagne that is likely to explode if treated roughly. This gives her an idea. As she is assigned a position at the exchange point, she can use a hatpin to prick the horses rear ends as soon as the Indian drivers climb onto the wagons. This sets the creatures into a gallop causing the wagons to shake and bounce uncontrollably on the rough ground. After the first few wagons are exchanged the remaining horses are so excited they stampede and the wagons head out with no drivers.The remaining Indians leave the rest of the women hostages behind and jump on their horses to pursue the wagons. The troops go after the Indians and mistake the sound of champagne bottles exploding for gunfire and surround the Indians and the wagons. The Indians, drunk and tired of the whole thing, surrender and decide to go peacefully home with just a few of the bottles of booze not destroyed in the chase.Meanwhile Wallingham and Jones try to slip away with the rest of the wagon train, but in the early hours of the morning Massingale and the women discovered the flags. Suspecting this was some scheme of Jones, they move the markers. This results in the wagons becoming hopelessly mired in the quicksand. Though the drivers and horses escape, the wagons themselves sink out of sight and Wallingham is forced into bankruptcy.With the whiskey gone, the women are escorted back to Fort Russell where, in a double wedding, Slater marries Louise and Gearhart marries Massingale, who has decided to retire from the temperance movement.Jones and Wallingham stake a homestead claim in Quicksand Bottoms where the occasional return to the surface of the bog of barrels of whiskey keeps them happy for a number of years.The miners return to Denver, where, despite all predations to the contrary, the winter turns out to be one of the mildest ones ever on record."

Casanova 70,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059015/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The amorous adventures of Andrea Rossi-Colombotti, an army officer who finds pleasure with beautiful women in life-threatening situations. Andrea Rossi-Colombotti, a U.N. official and modern-day Casanova, cannot get aroused unless there's danger in sex, but women and society are too compliant, so he's often impotent. A psychiatrist warns him it will get worse, and he should be celibate. Andrea tries and fails at that, abandons his fiancée, finds the occasional life-threatening liaison, and pursues a woman tethered to a dull but murderous husband. Will Andrea find pleasure and fulfillment, or is he doomed to pursue and then go limp when the pursuit is successful?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> NATO Officer Andrea Rossi-Colombotti is a ladies man with an unusual libido: he can only seduce women in situations where his life is in danger. The film begins with him breaking into a Corsican girlfriend's house; the girl, armed and voluptuous, believes Andrea a criminal and nearly shoots him before being seduced, but she later ends their relationship in the light of such an incident. Later, while spending an afternoon with an Asian air stewardess, he tries to achieve arousal by making up a situation about a dying relative, but the stewardess learns the sham and the liaison ends disastrously.Having had enough of his condition and the continuing problems it brings him, Andrea goes to a psychiatrist and pours out everything. He developed his problem in adulthood, but all his life he has flirted with woman and suffered from the consequences. The psychiatrist, while slightly unhinged due to long association with the deranged, recommends sensibly that Andrea try to seek out spiritual qualities in women rather than their physical attributes, and to attempt to connect with them emotionally.Andrea heads off to Switzerland, where he meets an Alpine girl, Gigliola. Following the doctor's advice, he doesn't seduce her but charms her and takes her out on romantic dates. Things go well between them and Andrea, attracted by her sweetness, proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the night before their wedding, the couple visit a circus, where a beautiful lion tamer challenges anyone to kiss her in the middle of a group of lions. Andrea can't refuse such an offer, and gives the lion tamer the kiss of her life, bringing an effective close to his Swiss romance.Andrea next entangles with an American woman, the wife of a major who happens to be his superior. This potentially dangerous and passionate affair is blown quickly, and Andrea gets posted to Sicily, where he encounters a Sicilian girl from a fierce-tempered honourable family. The girl's family accuses her of not being pure, and Andrea poses as a doctor in order to check on her, but in fact takes advantage of the dangerous opportunity to seduce her. The family catches him in the act and chase after him, and with much difficulty he escapes.Andrea now takes the only alternative he knows: he tracls down Gigliola, now in his opinion his first ever sweetheart, in the hope that her love will aid him in overcoming his problem. When she hears about Andrea's condition and his attempts to cure it, she pledges to give herself to him if it will make him stop with other women. Andrea, however, cannot bear to seduce a woman he truly cares for and instead spends the night with a pedicure who is reputed to bring ill fortune to her men.Andrea's next woman is a countess, whose husband is much older than she is and moreover suffers from deafness. She convinces him into a plot to murder her husband: they will seat him under a flimsy but heavy wall, which at the littlest sound will collapse on top of him. Aroused by such a dangerous venture, he consents (not planning to do anything of course). However, the count's deafness is a sham, and having heard the plan, he adjusts it to turn it upon Andrea: he adjusts the wall to become even more unsteady, and convinces Andrea to take his seat. But the seat itself breaks under Andrea's weight and while the count sets up a new one, Andrea accidentally slams a door and causes the wall to fall on him.Andrea is put on trial for his supposed crime, which attracts wide publicity and interest. Practically every woman he has encountered in the course of the film turns up at the court to speak about Andrea; however, Gigliola is the only woman who believes in his innocence and attempts to defend him. The psychiatrist Andrea consulted is called upon, but while giving testimony he completely loses his mind. All Andrea himself can offer the court is an apology from the heart for his condition and the trouble its caused for all concerned. But at the eleventh hour, an autopsy reveals that the count had sound hearing, and since the count, if he could hear, should have taken better care, the crime is considered an accident and Andrea is acquitted.The film ends with Andrea and Gigliola happily married and settled down in a high-rise apartment in Milan. However, Andrea is still living with his condition, and to Gigliola's shock he attempts to break into their eighth-floor bedroom..."

What turns up is a social worker who falls in love with Murray and a bit in love with Nick. As the child-welfare people try to force Murray to become a conventional man (the price they demand for allowing him to keep Nick), the nephew, who until now has gloried in his uncle's iconoclastic approach to life, tries to play mediator. But when he succeeds, he is alarmed by the uncle's willingness to cave in to society in order to save the relationship.—Warlen Bassham <wcb@zso.dec.com> In New York City, Murray Burns happily leads a life of non-conformity. One of his latest non-beliefs is in work, most specifically the 9-to-5 rat race, and he's been unemployed for 5 months after quitting his job as a writer on a children's television series. For 7 years he has taken care of his 12-year-old nephew, who attends the Revere School For Gifted Children. He was abandoned by his never-married mother, Murray's sister Elaine, and her current whereabouts is completely unknown. She had never even given her son a first or last name, and Murray made an agreement with him that he could call himself whatever he wanted until he turned 13, and then they would apply to give him his legal name. The boy currently goes by ""Nick,"" which Murray thinks he will choose as his legal name when he turns 13 in four weeks. Murray and Nick's situation comes to the attention of the Child Welfare Board, who could take Nick away from Murray as he has never been officially named as Nick's guardian and might not be deemed a suitable one because he has no job. The caseworkers for the Child Welfare Board are the administrator, the officious Albert Amundson; and the child psychologist, the more emotionally-sensitive Dr. Sandra Markowitz; just by their interactions with each other, Murray can see that Albert and Sandra also have a personal relationship. While Murray does make an impression on the pair, he knows that to keep Nick, whom he truly loves, he needs to make some quick concessions to show the Board that he is taking steps to being a responsible guardian. The question becomes how far Murray will go for Nick, especially to get work in his field, the nature of television having gone downhill in his opinion. Perhaps more importantly, how far will Nick let Murray change from the man he knows and loves?—Huggo Determined to avoid employment, eccentric former TV writer Murray Burns lives with his 12-year-old nephew Nick in a messy New York City apartment. When Nick's unconventional home life is discovered, Murray comes under the scrutiny of social worker Sandra Markowitz. Attempting to be responsible for both Nick and Sandra, Murray begrudgingly seeks a job. But can he truly commit to a more conventional life?—Jwelch5742"
In Harm's Way,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059309/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Naval officer, reprimanded after Pearl Harbor, is later promoted to Rear Admiral and gets a second chance to prove himself against the Japanese. On patrol the morning of December 7th, 1941, while commanding a cruiser Captain Torrey receives word of the attack on Pearl Harbor. His orders are to find the Japanese force and attack it. The film tells the story of three families during the outbreak of World War II.—michaeloshey Captain Rockwell Torrey and Commander Paul Eddington are part of the Navy's effort to recuperate from, and retaliate for, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Torrey is romantically involved with nurse Maggie Haynes, and also tries to restore his relationship with his estranged son, Jeremiah, a young Naval officer.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> The story opens on the night of December 6, 1941, at a dance in the Officers' Club at Pearl Harbor. We are at first introduced to Lieutenant (j.g.) William 'Mac' McConnel (Tom Tryon) and his wife Beverly (Paula Prentiss), who can't help but notice a visibly inebriated Liz Eddington (Barbara Bouchet) dancing with an Army Air Corps major (Hugh O'Brian) - spiting her husband who is at sea on gunnery practice. When the band launches into an upbeat swing tune, Liz engages in an exotic dance that for better or for worse draws the attention of every person in the club. Mac finally asks the band to make an end and play something else, which is heeded to Liz's disappointment. Her lover escorts her from the premises and takes her to spend the rest of the night on a beach near the base.Morning breaks over the unnamed heavy cruiser commanded by Captain Rockwell 'Rock' Torrey (John Wayne), who is nonplussed to find that his executive officer, Liz's husband Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas), has overslept reveille, the latest of a number of blemishes on his record that (along with his mounting alcoholism) can be laid to his unhappy marriage. He tells Eddington to 'fish or cut bait' and gives him one last chance to pull himself together. Eddington apologizes for his conduct, but is left wondering what Liz has gotten herself into in recent hours.In Pearl Harbor, Mac reports for duty as Officer of the Day on his destroyer, the U.S.S. Cassiday. With some consternation, he reads a radio dispatch from the destroyer U.S.S. Ward, which has depth-charged an unidentified submarine contact much too close to Pearl for comfort. Torrey's ship has received the same message; he orders alert status, then general quarters when one of his lookouts sights several large formations of planes flying over Oahu. The Japanese surprise attack is only minutes away. One formation flies over and strafes the beach where Liz Eddington and her lover are awakening, and they make a hasty escape back towards Pearl. As they hurtle around a curve, a truck barrels toward them in the wrong lane from the opposite direction, and the head-on collision sends them both plunging in flames off a cliff to their deaths.As nearly 350 Japanese aircraft descend on Pearl Harbor, an emergency sortie signal is sent to all ships; Mac, without waiting for his C.O. or further instructions, orders the Cassiday with cool-headed authority to get underway at once. The captain and executive officer give chase aboard a torpedo retriever, but Mac, knowing any attempt to stop and bring them aboard will render the Cassiday a sitting duck, ignores their shouts and plows out of the harbor at high speed. The Cassiday is one of not a dozen cruisers and destroyers to escape the harbor as the battleships and aircraft are decimated by the Japanese planes, much to the dismay of Admiral Kimmel (Franchot Tone), once he receives a situation report from his flag lieutenant.Torrey, meanwhile, gives orders for all outbreaking ships to group with his cruiser and reports his force strength to headquarters. It is a woefully small squadron of four cruisers and eight destroyers, a sneeze at a typhoon. Vice Admiral B.T. Broderick (Dana Andrews) urges Kimmel to position the force against a possible invasion, but Kimmel decides instead to have Torrey seek out and engage the Japanese. The orders are met with surprise and some anticipation by Torrey and his officers, who request underway refueling the following day. The morning of December 8 brings them nothing but an empty fleet oiler heading for home, leaving the task group without enough fuel to last half the day. Weighing his options, Torrey decides to cease zigzagging despite the known submarine threat.Not long thereafter, the American force is stalked by a Japanese submarine which is detected by the Cassiday as it approaches. Mac orders pursuit and depth-charging while Torrey orders zigzagging resumed. But the submarine gets into firing position and puts two torpedoes into the cruiser, causing severe damage in the engineering section and breaking Torrey's arm when he is thrown off his feet. Eddington goes below to take charge of damage control and finds the engineering deck a shambles of fire and out-of-control flooding. As DC parties scramble to save the ship, the Cassiday continues depth-charging, reporting a positive kill. Torrey orders all ships except the Cassiday back to Pearl Harbor, and conferring with Mac by megaphone, remembers him well from his days at the Naval Academy. Eddington reports the main damage under control as Mac complies with Torrey's request for a tow.A few days later, Torrey, his arm set and casted, reports to Admiral Kimmel's office where he is relieved of command for jeopardizing his force. He is reassigned to a desk to route convoys over his contention that the admiral's orders rendered the group 'expendable'. In the meantime, Eddington has learned of Liz's death and identifies her and her belongings at the Honolulu morgue, also learning of her companion's attachment to the Army Air Corps. In a rut of shock, he goes to a bar where he is offered a drink by another AAC officer who unwittingly rubs salt in the wound. The resulting brawl lands Eddington in the brig, where Torrey later arrives to have him released. They part ways in the sight of a new cruiser going to sea to replace their drydocked vessel - a baleful metaphor for the drydocking they both face.Three months later, Torrey's arm is pronounced healed by the X-rays of a nurse lieutenant named Maggie Haynes (Patricia Neal). His roommate, Commander Egan Powell (Burgess Meredith), a reserve intelligence officer, offers to celebrate at a social gathering in the Oahu hills. There, Torrey has a chance encounter with Maggie, who startles him with news of his estranged son - Jeremiah Torrey (Brandon De Wilde), now a reserve ensign who has been dating Maggie's roommate, Annalee Dorne (Jill Haworth). Torrey confesses that he has been divorced and not seen Jere in eighteen years. By the time Maggie drives him home and advises him that she's on temporary assignment, they have taken an obvious liking to each other. Torrey discovers that Jere is attached to a PT boat squadron in Pearl and goes to visit him, where they have a strained reunion; Jere lets it slip that he is about to be reassigned to Admiral Broderick's staff in preparation for an upcoming offensive called 'Skyhook'. Jere will be assistant to former Congressman Neal Owynn (Patrick O'Neal), serving in the Naval Reserve as Broderick's public-affairs officer.After a couple of weeks, a cheerful Powell arrives at Torrey's office, quietly letting on that he has been in Washington for the past ten days. Torrey takes him to lunch, and seeing Jere and Owynn sitting at a nearby table, takes the opportunity to ask Powell about Skyhook. Powell immediately puts a top-secret lid on it but is not surprised to discover that Owynn has been doing too much talking on Broderick's behalf. That evening, Torrey and Jere run into each other at Maggie and Annalee's apartment; there Maggie and Torrey remain while Jere and Annalee go to dinner at Owynn's house. As the evening wears on, Maggie and Torrey open up about each other's past of failed marriages and occupations chosen or unchosen. In the meantime, Owynn, obliging Jere's wishes, slips silently away to allow Jere a subtle run to second base. Annalee, wary of Owynn's disappearance and Jere's advances, puts the date - and their relationship - to an abrupt end.Torrey returns to his office after several days to find Powell waiting with a 'private little job': the routing of three hot and heavy convoys to a former Free French naval base on the island of Toulebonne in the South Pacific. Torrey figures out the Skyhook strategy, and explains to Powell that Broderick could use one of three nearby islands as a staging base to hit at a large island named Levu-Vana, whose central plain would make an ideal roost for B-17 squadrons. Powell wordlessly covers up the charts and leaves. Torrey arrives home that night to find Maggie sitting on his front steps; he invites her inside, where she regretfully tells him that her unit is being shipped out. Torrey, knowing where she's headed, calls on Powell to bunk out for the night, whereupon Maggie slips her shoes off in a classic 'fade to black' scene.Three weeks find the convoys safe and sound at Toulebonne, where Paul Eddington has been stationed since January overseeing piers and warehouses. Pursuant to a written request from Torrey, he boards the nurses' transport and asks to speak to Maggie, and welcomes her and several other nurses with flower chains, a basket of bananas and a hidden bottle of liquor. Maggie introduces him to Annalee and he immediately takes a shine to her. He gives Maggie the unexpected news that the convoy is due to shove off again that night for Broderick's advance base on Gavabutu, as 'that's where they're gonna need nurses'.Back in Hawaii, Torrey visits Beverly McConnel at her civil air defense post to give her the unpleasant news that Mac is MIA. She tearfully reads him a letter from Mac, written with his morale at a critical low, describing incessant air attacks on the Cassiday and the overall poor quality of Broderick's command, which has stalled the Skyhook advance and riddled the morale of the troops. Not long afterward, Torrey is summoned to a dinner party at Admiral Nimitz's quarters - and is shocked but pleased to find that the party is in honor of his promotion to rear admiral. Admiral Nimitz (Henry Fonda) tells him that he was correct in his guess at the Skyhook strategy, and awards tactical command of the operation to Torrey, effectively displacing Broderick from the action (or lack thereof). Broderick is incensed, and agrees with Owynn's suggestion to place a 'liaison officer' on Torrey's staff to keep him discreetly informed on Torrey's intentions, naming Owynn as that officer. Eddington arrives at Broderick's headquarters (having spent the past few hours at a whorehouse), and himself receives a surprise promotion to captain and an appointment as Torrey's chief of staff.Torrey and Eddington reunite on Gavabutu three days later and meet the rest of the staff, along with Australian coastwatcher Clayton Canfil (Stanley Holloway) and a ready and willing battalion of Marine paratroops. Their base almost immediately comes under a Japanese air raid and they make a mad dash for the command shelter, where Torrey outlines his plan to divide and conquer Gavabutu in three sections. At the all-clear, the staff scatter to their duties, and Eddington surreptitiously dismisses Owynn and Jere to prevent them from listening in on a scheme to procure additional transport planes. Torrey goes to the base hospital to visit Maggie, promising her that they'll make time for each other out here.The following Sunday, the Marines parachute into an open meadow on the north side of the island as an amphibious force lands on a northwestern beach, and a battalion of Marines, led by Canfil, crosses the mountains on foot. Torrey accompanies the paramarines aloft, ordering his plane's commander on a 'sightseeing trip' to overfly the mountains and deliver a change of orders to the foot battalion. Back at his HQ, Broderick, having arrived in the company of a group of war correspondents from Toulebonne, demonstrates a too-concise knowledge of the details, leading Eddington to suspect that Owynn has been quietly feeding him information. When Torrey returns, he is informed by his operations officer that the operation is well ahead of schedule - the Japanese garrison abandoned Gavabutu the previous night, presumably to reinforce Levu-Vana. He reports as much to Broderick and the correspondents, who are frustrated with the limited information Torrey gives them. Jere, earlier confronted by Eddington about his role in ratting on his father, renounces it in his newfound respect for him. Eddington later confronts Owynn as well, coercing him through harsh physical contact into returning to Toulebonne with Broderick. Owynn threatens a court-martial, but Jere, the only witness, refuses to bear him out, choosing instead to be transferred back to PT boats and remain under his father's command.Canfil returns to HQ from his guidance of the Marine battalion, and is promptly asked by Torrey and Eddington to reconnoiter the Japanese positions on Levu-Vana. He volunteers to go ashore alone with his intimate knowledge of the island and map the enemy emplacements. He is put ashore by a submarine under cover of darkness, sneaking into a Japanese camp and eavesdropping on a sake party.The next morning, Jere, back on duty with the PT squadron, is delivering mail to the hospital when he meets Maggie and Annalee; the latter shows him to the mail room, and old flames between them are rekindled, leading to an engagement to marriage after the war. Elsewhere in the world, other flames are fanned - Mac McConnel and the survivors of the Cassiday have been rescued and returned to the States for a month of survivors' leave. Beverly meets him in a passionate reunion at the pier in San Francisco, where he announces his promotion to lieutenant commander and his post-leave assignment as Torrey's flag secretary.Back on Gavabutu, Annalee, who is accompanying Eddington and a group of other personnel to a beach party, is warned by Maggie to be cautious around him, but insists on having a little fun. Maggie's warning is well warranted, for when Annalee separates from the group to go for a swim, Eddington follows her and watches from the beach. When she emerges from the water and tells him she's engaged, his reaction is less than rational - he flings her clothes out of her reach and rapes her, out of sight of the others. In her desperate attempt to fight back, she leaves her mark on his face, and it is noticed by Powell a couple of days later when Torrey and his staff put out to the harbor to meet his old ship, which along with several other cruisers and destroyers has just anchored at Gavabutu. Eddington dismisses the mark as 'just a friendly wound.'Aboard their old cruiser, Torrey and Eddington brief the senior officers of the task group on the planned invasion of Levu-Vana when they are interrupted by Canfil, just returned from his recon mission. He has painted a grim picture of the stronghold under construction, from tanks and troops to pillboxes and a nearly-completed airfield. Then he delivers the grimmest report of all - the Japanese are assembling a task force of their own at their nearby Cape Titan base. Torrey discusses options with his staff, deciding eventually that their best choice is to try and get a long-range recon plane from Pearl Harbor.In San Francisco, Mac McConnel returns from fleet HQ with ill tidings for him and Beverly: he has orders to proceed immediately to his new assignment on Gavabutu, despite having spent less than half of his leave. Beverly bursts into tears, lamenting that she may not get him back this time, and asks him to leave her with a baby.The rains are hammering Gavabutu and vicinity when Maggie returns to her barracks to find a note addressed to her. It is from Annalee - who has overdosed on sleeping pills, fearing pregnancy from the rape and being disbelieved by Eddington. Maggie desperately attempts to rouse Annalee, but finding that it's too late, she calls Torrey, who is discussing with Eddington and Powell the failure to secure a recon plane from Pearl. At Eddington's query, Torrey somberly tells him what has happened, leaving Eddington guilt-stricken as he heads for the nurse barracks. Maggie, boiling with anger, tells him the gist of the note, and Torrey promises to tell Jere personally before telling Maggie that Skyhook is starting very soon. She flings a farewell embrace on him and rushes away, as Torrey returns to HQ with his personal matters now weighing almost as much on his mind as his command responsibilities.First thing the next morning, Eddington dashes to the airfield and orders a long-range naval bomber prepared for him; he lifts off without telling a soul. Meanwhile, Torrey heads over to the PT boat base on the other side of the island, where he tells a grief-stricken Jere about Annalee and bids him farewell. He then repairs to HQ, where Mac has just arrived from Toulebonne, and sends Powell in search of Eddington before taking in a weather forecast. At the airfield, Powell finds out about Eddington's flight and summons Torrey and company, who arrive just as the radio operator makes contact. Eddington reports his position southwest of Cape Titan, but stops short as he sees a large task force heading south away from the cape. Ignoring a group of nearby Zero fighters, he drops out of the clouds for a closer look, counting twelve destroyers, four cruisers, and one gigantic battleship which he soon identifies as the Yamato - the largest and most heavily armed warship in the world. The Zeroes pounce on him again, and he has no time for evasive maneuvers before he and the bomber are destroyed. With the death of his best friend now compounding his concerns, Torrey dampens all optimism by concluding that the task force is headed straight for Levu-Vana to reinforce the land garrison. He decides to proceed with the invasion and then put back to sea with his own task group to try and stop the Japanese force at all costs. McConnel asks about a recommendation for a posthumous award to Eddington, but Torrey declines it, knowing that Eddington was trying to atone for his part in Annalee's death.Following the invasion, Torrey's cruisers and destroyers head for open sea to search and engage. They are unable at first to locate the enemy until they determine that the enemy is running through the narrow passage between Levu-Vana and neighboring Toko-Rota. Torrey orders the passage mined and the PT boats put in position. While waiting for a first report, he has a quiet conversation with Powell about battles at sea and the fear experienced by all men who take part in them - even admirals. All too soon, the Japanese reach the mine field, where several escorts are hit and disabled, prompting the PT boats to go in with guns blazing. The Japanese fight tooth and nail, and Jere, whose skipper is hit and killed by shrapnel, takes over command of his boat and manages to hit a heavy cruiser with two torpedoes before his boat is rammed and sunk by an enemy destroyer. The Yamato emerges from this stage of the battle unscathed.In the morning, amidst an unnervingly silent lull, Torrey receives the casualty report and is visibly devastated by the news of Jere's death in action. He is quiet but intent as he orders the destroyers to lay a smoke screen and prepare for the final engagement. The destroyers lay the screen as the cruisers turn broadside, lock and load, taking the first shots against the Japanese force. Many of the enemy escorts are hit hard; even the Yamato is lightly damaged, but presses on through the attack. Torrey orders evasive maneuvers as the Yamato opens fire. In spite of a number of hard course changes and pitched counterfire, the Americans are hopelessly outgunned, and the Yamato ultimately wrecks seven of their ships - Torrey's included. With the captain and bridge officers of his flagship killed, he attempts to take command but is hit and severely wounded by shell fragments from a magazine explosion. Mac, however, has stuck with him and gives the order to abandon ship, getting him into the water and onto a life raft.Torrey is in a coma for almost three weeks before he awakes aboard a hospital ship a day away from Pearl Harbor. His attending nurse summons Maggie, who rushes to his room to help him come around. She tells him all that transpired after he was knocked out - that he has lost his left leg and Mac is the only survivor of his staff. Torrey is all but traumatized, believing that he survived while the rest of his command was decimated to no good purpose. The next morning, with the hospital ship moored, Mac visits Torrey, telling him that the Japanese force turned tail and rushed back to Cape Titan for no fathomable reason. Admiral Nimitz comes aboard, and Torrey believes a court-martial is imminent until Nimitz sets him straight: he successfully turned back the Japanese task force and allowed Skyhook to take off, and the Japanese troops on Levu-Vana are now cornered. He further informs Torrey that he will be back in the Pacific theater on an artificial leg and commanding a new task force. Enlightened, Torrey drifts back to a well-earned sleep with Maggie watching over him."

Now some violent thugs are out to get him. They work for a shadowy figure known simply as The Major. Walking down twenty-seven flights of stairs after the power goes out in the New York City office building he is in, David Stillwell emerges outside on the ground level to find that a man he didn't know either jumped or was pushed out a window to his death. That man was Charles Calvin, the head of Unidyne, a humanitarian organization that works toward world peace. David notices other unusual goings-on. What he considers his normal routine that others he knows should recognize, don't. People that he doesn't know seem to know him, such as the beautiful young woman with who he walked down the stairs but who ran off when they got to the bottom. And things that he thought he saw or thought he knew end up not being the case, such as the multiple sub-basement levels he thought were in that office building which don't seem to exist in the clear light of day. When he finally thinks about it, he believes he has some form of amnesia. As an example, he knows that he works as a cost accountant, but he has no idea what a cost accountant is or does. He soon learns that some people are following him and are after something that he has, he not knowing what it is, and that they will shoot to kill if they don't get it. Conversely, the young woman, who he learns is named Shela and was once a love of his, is trying to convince him to cooperate with the people after him if only to save his life. Every direction David turns for official assistance, he comes up not trusting anyone, with the exception of a novice private detective he hires named Ted Caselle. Shela and the people after David all refer to ""the major"" as the person at the top who wants what David has. David may have to look deep into his troubled psyche to come out of his amnesia to learn who the major is, what he wants, whether David is willing to give it up if he indeed does have it, and that the death of Charles Calvin had some part to play. But David may be dead before he can even make an informed decision to cooperate or not.—Huggo After an office party, David Stillwell discovers that he has no memory of certain people, people who should be familiar to him, or of anything about his life from more than two years previously.

Aided by a rookie detective and confused by an old girl friend, he tries to make sense of inconsistent facts while people around him are being murdered.—Russell West David Stillwell makes his way down several flights of stairs in the dark after the lights suddenly go out in his office building. He is accompanied by an attractive woman. Thanks to his flashlight, he can see her, but she can't see him.

The day becomes stranger when he gets outside the building and discovers that someone has apparently committed suicide by jumping out of a window. And then, when he gets to his apartment building, things get dangerous. Within the next two days, David will encounter a chubby gunman, a rude maintenance man with horn-rimmed glasses, an abrasive psychiatrist and an inexperienced but shrewd private detective.

In the near future the two spaceships Argos and Galliot are sent to investigate the mysterious planet Aura. As the Galliot lands on the planet her crew suddenly go berserk and attack each other. The strange event passes, but the crew soon discovers the crashed Argos - and learns that her crew died fighting each other!

Then the crew-members in Argos go crazy and attack each other in a first moment. Soon Captain Mark finds that most of the crew from Argos is dead after fighting against each other. When the dead members resurrect, Captain Mark, communications officer Sanya and engineer Wess discover that parasite bodiless aliens have entrapped them with the transmission expecting to flee from their dying world. What will be their attitude?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the far reaches of outer space, two spaceships crash land on a uncharted, fog-enshrouded planet in response to a distress signal. During the course of the landing, both crews undergo a strange transformation. In a semi-hypnotic state, the crew of the Galliott savagely kill each other off. The only thing that prevents the Argos' crew from doing the same thing is Captain Markary (Barry Sullivan)'s resistance to the power that has overtake the others. Following some initial mayhem, Markary successfully manages to shake the others out of their trances. Not realizing that the other crew of the other spaceship is entirely decimated, the captain and several others make their way across the strange, uninhabited landscape, which is awash with bright colors and swirling mists, to see if they can be of any help. To their horror, the find the entire crew of the Galliott, including Markary's younger brother, to be dead.The men bury several of the bodies, but as most of the Galliott's crew are sealed into the control room, Markary and his men return to the Argos to retrieve the tools necessary to break through the doors. By the time he returns, the bodies in the control room have disappeared. The control room doors are now open, and all signs of violence has been erased. Only a puddle of blood, discovered by Wes (Angel Aranda), remains, but it is enough to convince Dr. Karen (Fernando Villena) that the captain did not imagine his macabre discovery. The crew return to the Argos thoroughly mystified by their situation. Soon after they leave, the grave markers start to shift outside the Galliott, heralding the return of the undead astronauts.Strange events begin to transpire. Though both ships were guided to the planet, no sign of life presents itself. Tiona (Evi Marandi), one of the crew persons, swears to Markary that she has seen some of the dead men from the Galliott walking nearby. Dr. Karen tries to assuage her fears that some unearthly force is at work, but soon even the captain is convinced that if there is any form of life on the plant, it is their enemy. The surviving crew attempts to leave the planet, but the damage done to the ship makes it impossible. Wes tells Markary that they will have to wait at least two days before the damage can be repaired.As more astronauts are mysteriously killed, tension among the crew continues to grow, and although Markary puts on a brave face, he confesses in his diary that he fears for the worst. During a land survey, Wes discovers another ship just a few miles from the Argos. Markary, together with Sanya (Norma Bengell) and Carter (Ivan Rassimov), walk over there to investigate the alien ship. Finding the calcified remains of the former crew, they determine that they are not the first ship to be lured into this trap. Narrowly avoiding being entombed in the interior of the ruined ship, Markary and Sanya escape back to the Argos, where they later find that Carter has mysteriously disappeared.Soon after, Kier (Federico Boido) and Sallas (Massimo Righi), two apparent survivors of the Galliott, appear at the Argos. Dr. Karan and Markary are both worried by their peculiar behavior and by the fact that neither one can explain where they have been since the landing. Karan observe that there is no disputing the fact that they are alive, to which Markary responds so it seems. Hearing this, Tiona reminds the captain the nothing is really what it seems on this planet. To set her mind at ease, Markary has several of the graves opened. In each one, nothing is left but the transparent plastic funeral shrouds in which the bodies were interred.Later that same night, Kier and Sallas are caught stealing a meteor rejecter from the control room. Though Kier is able to escape with the rejecter, Markary captures Sallas. Sallas real identity is revealed when the captain accidentally tears open the top of his uniform, revealing the body to be a mess of rotting flesh and exposed bone. 'Sallas' reveals that he is actually and alien being making use of the dead man's body. He goes on to tell Markary that since their sun has burned out, the planet is becoming uninhabitable, and that they are desperate to escape before they too perish. It is therefore necessary that they take possession of the astronauts in order to exist in a different atmosphere. 'Sallas' assures Markary that resistance is useless saying either all of us go back, or none of you will get there. The captain replies that he and his crew are willing to die in order to save their world, prompting the alien to vacate Sallas dead body. Markay realizes that one of power accessed through conformity. In order to maintain absolute control, it is necessary for the parasites to take posession of the entire crew, so as there is the slightest danger of rebellion, their control if thwarted.In a race against time, Markary and the final few survivors, whom include Sanya, Dr. Karan, and Tiona, go to the Galliott to retrieve the meteor rejecter, while Wes stays behind to guard the Argos. Markary decides that in order to ensure the destruction of the aliens, he plants a large explosive device on the Galliott while Sanya makes off with the meteor rejecter. But Dr. Karan and Tiona are killed in the subsequent battle with the re-animated astronauts. Markary and Sanya make it back to the Argos. The ship takes off with the three survivors just as the Galliott explodes.With the meteor rejecter in place, everything seems to be fine. But Wes is frightened by Markary's strange behavior. He confides his fears to Sanya, and together they confront the captain. Unfortunately for Wes, both Markary and Sanaya are now possessed by the alien beings. They offer to let him live in exchange for helping them fly to their home planet. Like Markary before him, Wes assures them that he would rather die than submit to them. Before being killed, Wes destroys the meteor rejecter.Without the meteor rejecter, the possessed Markary and Sanya realize that there is no way for the Argos to make it home. Instead they decide to stop at a closer planet less then a light year away. They are going to land on a strange planet called Earth, revealing that the astronauts are in fact not human at all, but from another distant planet. 'Sanya' tells 'Markary' that Earth is so small and thousands of years behind their planet in technology that its not even listed on most navigation charts since its population doesn't have the resources to travel beyond their planet. 'Sanya' asks 'Markary' how he thinks the people of Earth will react to them. ""I hope well... for them,"" he sneers."

Several leading Western scientists have been kidnapped only to reappear a fews days later. Unfortunately, each scientist has been brainwashed and is now completely useless. The British send Agent Harry Palmer to investigate. Palmer is surprised to be selected for such a mission (considering his past) and believes he has been chosen because he is expendable.—Dave Jenkins <david.jenkins@smallworld.co.uk> With a criminal past, Harry Palmer is a sergeant in the British Army working for the Ministry of Defense under the supervision of Colonel Ross, with most of Harry's recent work being rather mundane stakeouts. Despite Harry being insolent and insubordinate, or perhaps because of it, Ross ""promotes"" him to Major Dalby's counter espionage section to replace Taylor, one of Dalby's just murdered agents. That assignment of Harry's predecessor resulted in the kidnapping of British scientist Dr. Radcliffe - he the seventeenth British scientist of late whose departure from the British scientific community cannot be explained - with Dalby's section now tasked to locate and recover Radcliffe, even if it means paying a ransom if it becomes known that there may be a bidding war for his services. The only lead that Dalby is able to provide to the team is the name Eric Grantby, code named Bluejay, and his Chief of Staff, code named Housemartin. In working on the case, Harry befriends two other agents in the section, Jock Carswell and Jean Courtney, and in the process of discovering that each may have other allegiances learns that there is a possible mistrust that exists between Ross and Dalby. Harry begins to believe that Ross gave him this assignment to get rid of him in more ways than one. Harry will discover that he in the process does become a target, he needing to discover not only the who behind it i.e. if it truly is Ross trying to get rid of him, but why i.e. if it is solely professional in he being in the wrong place at the wrong time or if it is he himself as an individual the issue.—Huggo Harry Palmer is, grudgingly, still in the Army after his boss got him out of detention camp.

Two on a Guillotine,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059837/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The daughter of a psychotic magician must stay in his mansion for seven nights in order to inherit his fortune. The spitting image of her mother at that age, early twenty-something Cassie Duquesne never really knew her parents, Duke and Melinda Duquesne, having been sent to live with her aged maternal aunt in Wisconsin after Melinda abandoned the family when Cassie was an infant, Melinda's whereabouts since unknown. Twenty years ago, Duke and Melinda were at the top of the profession as a magician - The Great Duquesne - and his on-stage assistant respectively, they specializing in illusions of the macabre and gore. Cassie reenters the realm of her father's life when she returns to Los Angeles to attend his funeral, which is as theatrical as his life in that he vowed in his life to emerge from the dead. Beyond this issue, Cassie learns that she is the sole beneficiary of her father's $300,000 estate, with which those arguably closest to him, Buzz Sheridan and Dolly Bast, his longtime manager and housekeeper respectively, are outwardly all right in Duke's want to bring Cassie back, she who they state he loved from afar despite Cassie's belief that he never loved her in not seeking her out in life. There is one caveat to Cassie getting that inheritance: she must live for seven consecutive nights - midnight to dawn - in her father's isolated mansion. Getting over her initial antagonism toward him, Cassie is able to navigate through most of the unexpected occurrences in the mansion with the help of a man she meets, Val Henderson, they determining those occurrences all part of the illusions of the Great Duquesne's professional life. Cassie is however unaware that Val is really a reporter out to get a story. As more and more terrifying and inexplicable occurrences happen at the house, the questions become if someone is trying to frighten Cassie into losing the inheritance, and/or if the Great Dusquesne really has risen from the dead. The answers may partially be found in the locked room in the house which Cassie cannot get into as the Great Dusquesne had the only key which was buried with him.—Huggo Duke Duquesne is a very eccentric magician, and owing to his lifestyle his two-year-old daughter, Cassie, is sent away to live with an aunt. After twenty years, news of her father's death brings her back to Los Angeles to attend his funeral. The day after her arrival, she is told he left a rather odd will. It specifies that she will inherit her father's estate on the condition that she stay in his creepy palatial mansion for seven nights in a row - alone.—alfiehitchie TWO ON A GUILLOTINE synopsisMagician Duke Duquesne (Cesar Romero) is performing onstage with his wife and partner Melinda (Connie Stevens) who is tied up by her wrists on a gallows and stabbed with a sword twice. It all looks real and the audience likes it very much. The curtain closes and Duquesne takes a bow, then brings out Melinda who is shown to be in good health. But Melinda is not happy. She goes to her dressing room where she finds her young daughter Cassie, who has gotten into the makeup on the dressing table. She calls for Dolly Bast (Virginia Gregg), the child's nanny, to clean her up. Duke enters along with their press agent and manager Buzz Sheridan (Parley Baer) and wants to show him their new trick for which a new costume just arrived. Against her wishes Melinda comes with them to the stage where the cover is removed from a guillotine just constructed to Dukes specifications. The blade is hoisted above and locked and a doll is placed below. Melinda complains that it is Cassies doll but Duke tells her he will replace it in the morning. To demonstrate the guillotine, he releases the lever, but nothing happens. Buzzy slaps the side of the device, and the blade comes down, severing the dolls head.  At this point the title appears. Obviously the trick needs perfecting. Duke decides that they will go have dinner and return later to practice.Twenty years later, newspaper headlines proclaim the death of The Great Duquesne and say he promises to return from the dead.Cassie Duquesne (Connie Stevens) arrives to attend her fathers funeral at the graveside. Speaking to the minister (Jon Lormer), she apologizes for her plane being late. Dolly and Buzz talk to her, but she doesnt remember them. Several reporters are curious as to who she is and ask Buzz, who confirms that she is his daughter. Just before the minister begins, Buzz calls for men to chain and padlock the coffin (which also has glass windows showing Duquesnes head). Cassie, highly offended, protests and condemns Buzz for doing this but he insists that it was Duquesnes wishes. She runs off but is followed by reporters, who ask her about her fathers claims of returning from the dead. She tells them she hasnt seen her father in twenty years and to leave her alone.Watching her at the graveyard was reporter Val Henderson (Dean Jones), who next is seen talking to his editor (Russell Thorson) about her. He is shown a newspaper page from twenty years ago proclaiming  DUQUESNE WIFE DISAPPEARS. No one knew why Melinda left, whether it was another man or simply a desire to get away from her husband. The police tried to find her but came up with nothing. From that time on, Duquesne gave up on life. He stopped performing and holed up in his house, cared for by Dolly Bast. The shock of losing Melinda was something he never got over. Cassie's aunt took custody of her and apparently wouldn't let the child see her father.Val tells the editor he knows about Cassie because he drove her back to her hotel from the cemetery that day. When the editor suggests a human interest story, he says that she wouldnt be interested. He reveals that she didnt know he was a reporter when they talked.The will is read at the Hollywood Bowl by attorney Carl Vickers (John Hoyt) to Cassie, Buzz and Dolly. (Val is listening nearby, unseen.) The inheritance is to go to Cassie provided she is able to stay in the Duquesne mansion for seven nights alone. If she is not able to do this, the money will be divided half to Buzz and half to Dolly. As she is leaving, Val approaches asking questions and offering to drive her to the house. She politely refuses and takes a cab.Arriving at the house, she is unlocking the door when Val comes up, making up a story about his uncle forcing him to buy the property to build a new subdivision. Uninterested, she tells him how he and his uncle are beneath contempt, citing that her father was buried yesterday. She asks him to leave and he walks off.Inside, she looks around and goes to turn on a light switch, which sets in motion a skeleton on a wire that descends and scares her. Hearing her screams, Val returns to the house and enters. She shows him the skeleton and he presses the button, which resets it. He suggests that they check the rest of the house to make sure no one is there before he leaves. She agrees and they begin with the ground floor. A white rabbit is found on a desk. As they look at various paintings, he makes joking remarks which she giggles at. The go through a music room which has a piano and harp. Upstairs they find a room containing masks of Duquesne along with swords, a dividing cabinet and a disappearing cabinet which Val enters. When she looks for him, he seems to have vanished. She calls loudly for him and goes out into the hall. He emerges from an adjoining room and scares her. He tells her the cabinet opened into the other room. They go on to the next floor.Finding a bedroom, they enter and Cassie notices the painting over the mantle of her mother. Val agrees that she is very beautiful. She tells him that she feels odd but a sense of closeness here in her mothers room. They talk about family, and then he says he will bring up the luggage. She invites him for cold roast beef sandwiches which are in a small case. Opening up the closet door, she screams as a full-sized stand-up of her father looms forward. Val comes back and sees it.They talk and eat before a roaring fire until she gets tired. He goes to escort her back upstairs when they hear the sounds of a woman moaning. Next the telephone rings and when she answers there is only heavy breathing. He tells her to hang on while he traces the line. Across the room he locates a tape recorder running which is wired to speakers throughout the house. She tells him to turn it off. He says he should sleep on the couch under the circumstances. She promises to stay in bed.The next morning he has already found keys and looked around but there is one room at the top of the stairs for which no key can be found. He says he believes the sound of chains came from that room. Going down to the kitchen, he tells her that he has already gone out and gotten breakfast, which is ready. He notices that the cellar door is ajar, remarking that he thought he had closed it. They sit down to eat and drink coffee, when the doorbell rings. They go outside to greet the new housekeeper, an older woman named Ramona (Connie Gilchrist). Inviting her to breakfast, they tell her about the haunted house and noises coming from the cellar. When she finds the vacuum cleaner, she goes to the front hall to begin cleaning. All at once they hear her scream. She has found the skeleton and fainted. When she comes to, she sees the rabbit looking at her and screams again. Helping her up, she grabs her things and leaves, with both Val and Cassie laughing. They drive her to the bus stop.Val talks her into taking the day off to do something fun. They go to a carnival and ride rollercoasters, bumper cars, house of mirrors and try their hand at games of skill. Riding in a tram-car, they talk about her living in the house. He suggests they go out for a steak, wine and some soft talk.They end up at a nightclub where an r&b group is performing. They watch the dancers, including three go-go girls dancing in a cage. They begin to kiss passionately.The scene shifts to the house, where the kiss continues until they hear a woman scream from upstairs. Val runs upstairs and finds Dolly, half out of her mind. Cassie asks what frightened her and is told that she saw her father at the top of the stairs. Val goes up to check. Finding no one, he tries the room at the top of the stairs which is still locked. He asks Dolly about it and is told no one ever went in that room but Duquesne. He asks where the key is and she tells them it was buried with him in the grave at his wish. They take her downstairs. At this point the rabbit is seen climbing the stairs, stopping at the top room door. Underneath the door the light inside is shown to go out.Downstairs, Dolly confesses her love for Duquesne, saying after Melinda left he went mad, mourning for her every night. Once she said he saw Cassies picture in the paper and thought it was Melinda. He had Dolly write her a letter at her aunt Elizabeths who had adopted her, but the letter came back unopened. Duquesne was devastated, she said. Cassie is told that her father adored her and embraces Dolly. At this point Val takes her aside to another room and tells her they should take her to the bus station. Cassie asks why and he tells her that Dolly is making all this up and if she remains she will drive Cassie nuts. They argue and Val tells her that Dolly and Buzz have everything to gain if she is frightened away. Cassie reluctantly agrees but refuses to come when Dolly is driven to the bus stop.When a drunken Dolly gets to the bus stop, Val tells her that her performance was impressive. She curses him and tells him Duquesne will get him. She says she will tell Buzz who is waiting at a local bar. Val drives off.Back at the house, Cassie wanders into the music room and turns on the tape machine. She hears her mother singing on the recording. Suddenly she hears a noise and turns the tape off. Going to the foot of the stairs, she looks up and sees the rabbit with a box at the top of the stairs. The rabbit upsets the box, which opens and a womans head falls out and rolls down the stairs. Cassie screams and Val arrives at the house in time to rush in and comfort her. She points for him to look. He comes in and finds the head, telling her it is a likeness of her mother that they used in magic tricks. Replacing the head into the box, he holds Cassie in his arms, telling her she needs to get some rest. He takes her upstairs.Next morning he says he will go talk to Dolly again and also Buzz. She tells him she will garden and sunbathe. Val drives away and Cassie goes inside. At the top of the stairs she picks up the head box to find it empty.At the bar, Val asks for Buzz Sheridan. The bartender takes him over to where Buzz is passed out at a table. They talk, and Buzz tells him Dolly explained everything from the night before. He denies that they are conspiring against Cassie and tells Val to go talk to Dolly.Meanwhile at the house, Cassie is sunbathing when a man walks up and starts talking to her. She remembers him as one of the reporters from the funeral. He tells her Dolly reported that Duquesne came back from the dead. She refuses to talk. About that time Val come up and is recognized by the reporter. When Cassie finds out Val is a reporter she tells him to leave. He tells her he is in love with her. She tells him if he has any decency he will leave. She locks him out of the house. The other reporter apologizes to Val, saying he didnt know. Val tries to get Cassie to let him in to explain but she listens inside the door. Val gets in his car and drives off. Cassie comes outside to try and catch him before hes gone, but is too late.That night Cassie has nightmares: she is running away from her father, she sees Dolly and Buzz with horrible faces trying to scare her and then she is in the glass-lined coffin, unable to get out. Dolly is shoveling dirt on her in her grave. Suddenly she awakens, believing she heard a noise. Coming outside her bedroom, she goes to the top of the stairs. The locked room is standing open. She enters, carrying a fireplace poker. Inside the room she sees the guillotine. At one side is an oblong box with a closed lid. She approaches it and lifts the lid, looking in. Horrified, she runs downstairs and calls Val. Finally he answers and she tells him she found a headless body in the box and for him to come. Val assures her it must be one of her father's props, but promises to come immediately. Locking herself in the drawing room, Cassie awaits his arrival.When the clock strikes twelve, she hears a scratching noise at the door. When the noise stops, she hears another nearby. Investigating, she finds the rabbit having knocked over a metal bowl. She looks up and is horrified to see Duquesne at the top of the stairs looking at her. She screams at the top of her lungs and he comes down to face her. There is a slight struggle and then she tells him that he is really alive. She accuses him of faking his own death. She tells him if she had known he wanted her she would have come. He says he wrote her but the letter came back unopened. She tells him she never got the letter. She said that she had prayed all these years, hoping he would want her. He tells her he has always loved her and opens his arms to her. She embraces him warmly until he calls her Melinda. She backs away. At that moment Dolly shows up and remarks how he is alive. He tells Dolly that Melinda has returned to him. Both Dolly and Cassie try to tell him that this is his daughter. Dolly says Melinda is dead and that she buried her in the woods behind the house. Cassie asks how her mother died and is told by Dolly that the guillotine failed. Cassie tries to run but hits her head and falls. Duquesne picks her up and carries her upstairs.. Dolly follows and tries to stop him, but he pushes her down the stairs. Dolly tries to call the police. Duquesne carries Cassie up to the guillotine room and lays her on top of the oblong box. He picks up the dress, saying that he saved everything for her return.Meanwhile, Dolly is seen outside as Val drives up. She tells him that Duquesne faked his death to lure Cassie home and is trying to do the guillotine trick again. Dolly says that is how Melinda died but that Duquesne would never accept it. They get into his car and approach the house. Next we see Cassie fully dressed in her Marie Antoinette costume and placed in the guillotine. Duquesne begins speaking as if to a crowd, forgetting some of the words. Val and Dolly enter the house and run upstairs, coming into the room. Duquesne tells them to take a seat. He says for Dolly to seat the gentleman, whom he thanks for coming to see this feat. He tries to continue his speech even as Val tries twice to advance on him, held back by Dolly. Duquesne tells him if he is squeamish to close his eyes, look away or even leave the auditorium. Val stops him, grasping for words to say. He tells Duquesne that the follow spotlight is not working and the audience cant see him. Duquesne comes forward, looking up. At this point Val jumps him and a fight ensues. At one point the lever is released and the blade comes down. A head rolls into the basket. Duquesne picks up the head and begins crying. Val notices Cassies hands moving and gets her out of the machine. She attempts to comfort her father, who cradles the head, saying that he had perfected the trick. Val pulls her away as a siren is heard. Val and Cassie go downstairs where the police have arrived and are told to go to the room at the top of the stairs. The rabbit is shown one last time and suddenly disappears."

Selina has never attended school, and on Rose-Ann's direction she lives as a shut-in, only cleaning the apartment and cooking dinner, which must be on the table by the time Rose-Ann gets home or else.

In London, Belgian immigrant Carol Ledoux shares an apartment with her older sister Helen, and works as a manicurist at a beauty salon. Helen uses the word ""sensitive"" to describe Carol's overall demeanor, which is almost like she walks around in a daze, rarely speaking up about anything. When she does speak up, it generally is about something against one of those few issues on which she obsesses, such as Helen's boyfriend Michael's invasion of her space at the apartment. That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michael's actions, as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michael's lovemaking, and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor, Colin, who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them.

Are they right?—Alfred Jingle The American single mother Ann Lake seeks out someone in the nursery Little People's Garden School in Hampstead. She finds a German cook and explains that she has just moved from the United States to London and she left her daughter Bunny Lake at the First Day Room alone with a baby. Now she needs to receive the delivery men at the apartment she rented and she needs to leave Bunny for a moment and the cook says that she can check on her daughter. When Ann returns, she does not find neither the cook nor Bunny and no one in the nursery seems to have seen the girl. Ann calls her brother Steven Lake and the police. Superintendent Newhouse investigates the case with his men and there is no evidence of the little girl. Soon he begins to question whether Bunny Lake does exist or is Ann's imaginary daughter.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Ann Lake and her brother Steven are moving into a new house, with Ann and her daughter Bunny having just moved to England from the US. The day of the move is quite hectic, as Ann also has to drop Bunny off for her first day of school. When Ann comes to collect Bunny, she is nowhere to be found. The Police are called in, but they more they investigate, the more it appears that Bunny Lake never existed.—grantss Having just arrived in London from Boston, single mother Ann Lake believes that she has dropped her four year old illegitimate daughter, Felicia - who Ann has nicknamed Bunny, the name of her imaginary childhood friend - off for her first day at her new school. Ann's belief is tested when she goes to pick up Bunny after school, Bunny who is not there. No one at the school even remembers ever seeing Bunny. The only person in London who knows Ann and can vouch for her assertion is her brother, magazine reporter Steven Lake. Ann's worry is heightened because there have been a few child abductions and murders of late. The police are brought into the matter. The further that sympathetic lead investigator, Superintendent Newhouse, gets into the investigation, the more it seems like Bunny is a figment of Ann's imagination, her fantasy supported by Steven for her own mental well-being. Steven however seems convinced that someone knows of Bunny's disappearance, that someone perhaps being one of the plethora of school administrators including its elderly owner, Ada Ford, or the Lake's seemingly eccentric landlord, Horatio Wilson.—Huggo Young ANN LAKE has just moved to England from America with her successful but controlling brother STEPHEN. The two are extremely close, with Stephen doting upon Ann. In a hurry the day she enrolls her child, BUNNY, in a private school, Ann leaves her in the First Day room and asks the school's female German COOK to watch her and then runs off to meet the movers and do errands.
At noon, Ann returns to the school to pick up Bunny. To her increasing dismay, however, no one at the school seems to know where Bunny is or even who she is. Ann interrogates one of the school's staff, Elvira, who hasn't a clue about the child. When the arrogant Stephen arrives, he badgers Elvira further.Soon, SUPT. NEWHOUSE, an unflappable British police officer, arrives, looking into the matter. He talks with all parties involved, including ADA FORD, one of the school's elderly founders. The eccentric Ada resides in an upstairs room, where she's currently compiling a tome about childhood nightmares.Newhouse continues his investigation, tolerating the threats and barbs from Ann's increasingly accusatory brother, Stephen. But as Newhouse puts together Ann's profile, he begins to doubt her story in subtle ways. After all, since no one saw the child (the Cook has quit and disappeared) he has to wonder if Ann even has a child. Is she delusional, perhaps?The insinuation infuriates Stephen, but he seems to back it up with references to Ann having had an imaginary playmate named Bunny as a child. Ann must now try to find clues that her child really existed. She must also fend off her creepy new landlord, WILSON, an aging Lothario actor who's always drunk and carting about his little dog. The POLICE interrogate him, as well. When Stephen comes across Newhouse talking and drinking with Ann in a pub, he blows up at the officer, threatening and accusing him.As police attempt to locate the Cook, Ann's nightmare intensifies. Desperate for evidence that will prove the existence of her child, she suddenly remembers the claim check for a doll hospital that's repairing Bunny's doll. In spite of the late hour, Ann goes off in a cab after telling Stephen where she's going. In the meantime, Newhouse and his MEN look into the ship travel records that brought Ann and Bunny to England.Ann finds the doll shop, which, although closed, has an unlocked door. She locates the doll. Stephen has followed her, however, and once Ann presents him with the doll and goes off to deal with the Proprietor, Stephen gets a crazed look in his eye and sets the doll afire. Ann is horrified and Stephen strikes her and takes her to a hospital unconscious and leaves her.Ann escapes the hospital and locates Stephen in the remote house they originally temporarily lived in after arriving in England where he has Bunny hidden. Stephen is the kidnapper! Indeed, Stephen is so close to his sister Ann he found Bunny an intrusion in their relationship. Stephen has now lapsed into another identity - a more murderous one and likely an extension of their imaginary selves as children. He's now intent upon killing the child, so as to have sole access to his sister again.Ann gets Bunny away from the demented Stephen by engaging him in a series of children's games. Stephen chases Ann and Bunny, but Newhouse and the Police soon arrive, arresting the demented brother. They finally found the evidence they needed of the child's existence by way of the ship's passenger records."

The Collector,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059043/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man kidnaps a woman and holds her hostage just for the pleasure of having her there. Freddie, a socially withdrawn bank clerk and butterfly collector, decides to expand to collecting human specimens. That's where art student Miranda Grey comes in. Miranda matches wits with Freddie the icy psychopath.—A.M.Putnam Freddie Clegg isn't sure if he can carry out his plan for ""her"" until he stumbles across an isolated house for sale in the English countryside, the house he spots while he's butterfly collecting. The ""her"" is London based art student Miranda Grey, the plan to kidnap and hold her captive. Much like he loves his butterflies, Freddie loves Miranda, but from afar. In his mind, his love for her is based on respect for her as a person and not physical lust. So when he does manage to kidnap her and hold her hostage in the basement of his newly purchased house, she, not knowing who he is, is surprised that he is neither looking for ransom money or to sexually assault or rape her. He tries to respect her wishes except the most important wish of letting her go. As she tries to understand what he wants from her, they negotiate the terms of her captivity. All the while, she tries how best to escape while maintaining her safety while in the precarious position of being captive.—Huggo After winning a large amount in the pool in Reading, the outcast bank clerk and entomologist Freddie Clegg buys an isolated house in the countryside. He stalks the art student Miranda Grey in London and uses chloroform to kidnap and bring her in his van to his house.

Freddie promises to respect Miranda with his platonic love and to release her in a month on June, 11th. He shows also his collection of butterflies carefully kept in a room. However, Miranda feels that she is another collectable species only for the deranged man that feels power and control with the situation ans he has no intention to let her go.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Infatuated for years with the fresh and charming London art student, Miranda Grey, the repressed, silently-boiling, former white-collar worker and now an avid butterfly collector, Freddie Clegg, finally decides to broaden his collection with a rather exotic new specimen. For this reason, the delusional lepidopterist buys a beautiful and totally secluded English countryside manor--and from the time he hatched his audacious plan--the unsuspecting victim simply stood no chance. From now on, an ancient and hideous cellar will be Miranda's new home, for as long as it takes to understand Clegg's desire and, ultimately, reciprocate his feelings. But, can this be called love? In the end, are wits and a strong will to survive enough to escape a love-smitten madman's prison?—Nick Riganas While collecting butterflies out in the English countryside, a young man named Freddie Clegg (Terence Stamp) stumbles across an old secluded house for sale. Looking through the house on his own, he seems most interested in the basement. He decides to buy the house, its purchase the catalyst for actually carrying out the plan he has devised for her. He wasn't sure if he could carry it out before coming across the house.The ""her"" in question is a young woman named Miranda Grey (Samantha Eggar), she a student at the Blake School of Art in London. Freddie knows her whereabouts at all times. On the day he decides to carry out his plan, he follows her from school to a pub where she meets with a young man. After that meeting which she seems sad about, she wanders around a secluded urban park. His van is parked so that she would have to get right next to it to pass. As she does, he jumps out of the van, grabs her, knocks her out with chloroform, and gets her into the back of the van. He drives her to his newly purchased house, and carries her still unconscious into the basement. He lays her down onto a bed, and walks out of the basement, bolting the door behind him. The basement door is behind a hidden door masked as a bookcase to the main part of the house. He goes into the kitchen to splash water on his face, when it starts to rain outside. Transfixed, he goes outside to lie in the rain. There, he reminisces about one of many painful encounters he had at the bank where he worked in Reading. He is being tormented by his colleagues, who call him the butterfly boy. His Aunt Annie (Mona Washbourne) visits him at the bank, something she is not supposed to do, telling him that he has won £71,000 in the football pools.Miranda eventually awakens, frightened not knowing where she is. She yells for help while pounding at the door, to no avail. She goes to the sink to splash water on her face. She notices that the makeshift bathroom area (there is no tub or shower) is designed for a woman, with many new women's toiletries available for use. She also finds a shelf filled with art books, and a dresser and closet filled with women's clothes her size. She hears noise at the door. Freddie knocks before he enters. He has brought her a tray of food and returns her purse minus any dangerous items, such as the file and scissors. Not knowing who he is, she suspects that he has kidnapped her for ransom despite she not coming from a rich family. He demonstrates to her that he knows all about her (including that she is not rich) and is attentive to her wants and needs. He leaves, bolting the door behind him. She clamors at the door shouting for him to come back.The next day, Freddie drives into London. He sees news in the papers that she is missing.Back at the house, Freddie brings Miranda more food. She has a more defiant attitude and demands to know who he is and why he brought her here. She now suspects he's a sexual predator. He tells her that he has every respect for her and is a guest at his house. As she runs to try and escape, he grabs her from behind. This act of touching her makes him confess that he is in love with her, something he was not going to tell her until she got to know him better. She is shocked by this revelation. He tells her that he had originally seen her on a bus in Reading where she is from, he even sitting next to her on a couple of occasions. When she got the scholarship to attend Blake in London, he thought he would forget about her, but her absence made him realize she was the only one for him. She then tries to reason with him, stating that he could get into trouble, that she worked hard for the scholarship and that her family must be worried sick. He knows in his heart that the reason she wants to leave is because she is in love with the chap she met at the pub the day of the kidnapping. His ultimate rebuttal is that although people may be looking for her, no one is looking for him. She tries to reason with him one more time, stating that she won't tell anyone, that she'll become his friend and admire him for his chivalry. As he still won't let her go, she runs out the open door to find the next door still locked, with no one behind it to hear her yells for help. Knowing that she is still trapped, her behavior turns to anger. She tells him if her release is dependent upon her falling in love with him, she'll be there until she dies. He walks out quietly carrying the tray of food.As he comes down the next day to bring her more food, he can hear her moaning in pain behind the door. Entering, he finds her on the bed writhing in agony. She says it feels like an appendix problem and that she needs a doctor. Concerned both for her and for his own safety, he vows to go to the corner of the road to the phone box. As he rushes out, he leaves all the doors open. After no longer hearing his footsteps, she, only feigning the illness, quietly gets up and tiptoes to the first door. She sees the second door open to outside. As she approaches, the door shuts closed. Freddie knows she was lying to him. As he approaches her, she slaps him across the face. He has a sad look. She dejectedly walks back into the basement, and slams the door behind her. Coming into the basement, he offers her a bargain: he will let her go in six weeks no questions asked if she starts eating, if she talks to him and if she is nice to him. They negotiate the time frame ultimately to four weeks, the release date specified as June 11th. Despite telling him that he will never get what he ultimately wants which is for her to fall in love with him, she agrees, with conditions of her own: she wants some fresh air, some natural light, specific food (fruit and salad), art materials and most importantly the ability to write a letter to her family. He agrees to her conditions. As she finally starts to devour the food he's brought for her, he leaves, with a new bounce in his step buoyed by her agreeing to stay.About a week later, there is a calendar that Miranda has painted on the brick wall with the art supplies he has provided her. She is crossing off the days to ""freedom"" day. She asks Freddie, who is sitting there with her, to do something to keep her amused: dance or tell a story. She says all men know dirty stories. He is reluctant. As she is about to tell the filthiest story she knows, he stops her and tells a silly joke, to which she giggles. He then offers her a treat: a bath in the main part of the house. She's excited, even if he is going to tie her hands behind her. Because of her protests, he decides not to gag her. As they walk outside into dusk, she deeply breathes in the fresh air. She pleads to take a short walk before the bath. He agrees. As they take a few steps, he turns around and starts to caress her arms and face. She increasingly looks panicked and eventually starts to scream. She stops when he places his hand on her mouth. Knowing that he has crossed a line, they walk quietly into the house. She tells him that if he decides ever to cross that line with her again, not to do it in a mean way and she won't struggle. But if it does happen, she'll never forgive him and she'll never speak to him again. He understands and agrees.As they enter the bathroom, he unties her hands, leaves the room and closes the door behind him. She notices the door is unlockable, peeks out and sees him sitting in a chair in the hallway. Seeing her, he tells her he will respect her privacy. She goes back into the bathroom, and turns on the water as a noise distraction as she surveys the room. The windows are boarded and bolted and he has removed anything that she can use as a weapon. On the other side of the door, he questions her about the man in the pub, seeing them as an unlikely match. She offers little information beyond stating that he is only a friend. She starts taking her bath when the doorbell rings. Sensing an opportunity, she starts to scream. Freddie quickly rushes into the bathroom and overpowers her, gags her, pulls her out of the tub and manages to tie her up to a pipe. Thinking that she's secure, Freddie espies the visitor from an upstairs window. When he sees the visitor snooping around the basement door, he feels he has no option but to acknowledge his existence. He is his neighbor from down the lane, Colonel Whitcomb (Maurice Dallimore), who thought he would finally introduce himself. The Colonel has noticed some of the modifications he's made to the house, such as the lights in the basement, to which the ancient monuments people of the area would object. As the Colonel enters the house, Miranda can hear he's there and his reference to her captor as ""Franklin"". She can just reach the bathtub faucet with her foot and tries to turn it on to create some noise. Just as the Colonel is about to leave, Miranda is able to turn on the faucet. As the Colonel hears the noise, Freddie announces that he has a male cousin staying with him. As the Colonel gets distracted by other items in the house, the water starts to overflow from the bathtub. As the Colonel is about ready to leave for the second time, water starts flowing down the stairs which both Freddie and the Colonel notice. Freddie runs up the stairs announcing that it is really his girlfriend staying there. He manages to go into the bathroom to have a discussion with his ""girlfriend"" about the water problem, while in the meantime turning off the faucet, unplugging the drain and tying Miranda up tighter. Freddie comes back out and announces to the satisfied Colonel that the problem was a faucet handle that came off and that his girlfriend didn't call out because of the embarrassment of being caught unmarried in a compromising position in a man's house. After the Colonel leaves, Freddie unties Miranda. Both are silent, but Freddie brings the towel further up to cover her otherwise unclad body, then leaves her to let her dress in peace.As Miranda exits the bathroom, Freddie is waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs. She requests that he tie her hands in front rather than behind since it hurts less. He obliges. Before heading back to the basement, Freddie shows her his massive butterfly collection, which includes some exotic specimens he raised from larvae sent to him from other parts of the world, some breeds which he developed himself, and some still live specimens. This has been his hobby since childhood. Despite seeing the beauty of the collection, she uses the words ""kill"" and ""death"" to describe what he's doing. She also then realizes that she is his latest collectable. This collecting is not based on love, but rather an infatuation reminiscent of schoolboys. When he mentions in passing his time working at the bank in Reading, she remembers him in the news about winning the pools. She tries to persuade him to do something more meaningful with his life with those moneys.Days later, Miranda is doing a pencil self-portrait as she looks in the mirror. Freddie asks her if she would consider selling it. She makes the asking price £200. He agrees. She doesn't understand why anyone would want it as she thinks it's garbage. She tears it out of her sketch pad, hands it to him and tells him to keep it with his butterflies. She seems out of sorts, he believes because she has not yet written her letter to her family. Handing her some nondescript stationery, he starts to dictate what she can write in that letter: that she is safe and well looked after. As she is addressing the envelope she tries to distract him by offering him another one of her sketches on the wall for free. As he turns to choose one, she slips another note in the envelope along with the dictated letter. He hands her the chosen sketch which he asks her to sign. She sarcastically signs it ""prisoner #..."" As he seals the envelope, he feels around its edges and can feel something extra inside. He opens it to see the second note. It basically tells that her captor's name is Gerald Franklin, he being the winner of the football pools. But what he is offended by is the statement that she is frightened. They begin to argue, he accusing that she still looks down on him and so would her friends and her type. As she tries to convince him otherwise, he asks if he could talk to her friends about the book she requested him to buy for her, ""The Catcher in the Rye"". She says yes. As such, he takes the book off the bed and announces that he will read it. As he exits, he tears up the letter in front of her stating that it would have done no good since they are not in Reading and his real name is not Franklin.On ""freedom"" day, Miranda is wearing her own clothes as Freddie brings her a tray of food. She is putting things in order in the basement and offers him all the pictures on the walls. She puts on her coat ready to leave. When she reminds him of the day and their agreement, he tells her that she will be released at midnight. As she sits down dejected, they begin to talk about ""The Catcher in the Rye"". When he mentions that he found it unrealistic, she quietly tells him that that is a valid point of view. That statement and others later concerning a Picasso painting show him that she is being patronizing and condescending. He realizes that they can never be friends on the outside. Feeling like she's jeopardized her freedom, she clamors at the door as he leaves. On either side of the door, both Freddie and Miranda are in tormented and in tears. Freddie heads upstairs to his own bedroom to retrieve a box. He brings it back down for Miranda, telling her it is for this evening. He leaves her alone to let her open the box in peace.Later that evening, Freddie comes down to see that Miranda is wearing the evening dress that he bought for her. They will be having supper upstairs tonight, and he isn't even tying her hands for the walk up. She is pleased. She walks upstairs with enthusiasm to see a candlelit table complete with champagne and caviar. As they talk about life in the immediate future, she notices he has had her sketch framed. As they sit down to eat, she finds a ring box in her napkin. He asks her to marry him, the marriage to be in name only. She would live at the house but be free to do whatever she pleases, even sleep in another bedroom. She replies that that is not marriage; marriage is belonging wholeheartedly to another person. But she does agree to marry him. With a sinister look in his eyes, he states that to get married, they would require witnesses, implying that he is not letting her have her freedom. As she understands that implication, she runs toward any door trying to get out. She eventually runs into the butterfly collection room. He corners her with chloroform in his hands. As she grabs for an insect pin and tries to stab him, he overpowers her and renders her unconscious with the chloroform. He carries her unconscious body out of the room and stops. Instead of taking her to the basement, he instead brings her upstairs into his bedroom. He lays her down on the bed and lies next to her. He gently caresses her body and face before eventually embracing her.When she awakens the next day, she is back in the basement with Freddie seated in a chair next to the bed. He apologizes for the force, but he defends its use since she provoked it. He also claims that he did not take advantage of her in her unconscious state. He says that he has to keep her a little while longer since she has not *tried* to do want he ultimately wants, which is for her to fall in love with him.Later, Miranda is coming out of the upstairs bathroom. She puts out her hands ready for them to be tied, which Freddie does do. She asks if they can sit in the living room instead of heading to the basement. They have a drink of sherry while doing so. She wants them to be friends again. She sits on his lap, places her tied arms around him and asks him to do the same. They kiss on her request. When she asks him to untie her hands, he obliges despite accusing her of pretending. She slowly undresses and she kisses him. As she encourages him to kiss her back, he does so passionately for a few seconds, then stops abruptly. He yells at her that she thinks he will have to let her go if they make love. Comparing her to a whore, he no longer respects her and tears up the drawing of hers he had framed and throws it into the fireplace. After she dresses, he reties her hands together. She then realizes that she is never getting out alive. She directly asks him that question. He does not answer. He opens the door as they walk through the pouring rain toward the basement door. As they approach the door, she sees a shovel. She distracts him by dropping her toiletries on the ground. As he picks them up, she grabs the shovel and hits him over the head. Horrified by his bloodied face the result of what she's done, she instead decides to run. He quickly catches her. While clutching his bloodied head, he drags her yelling and screaming toward the basement door. He throws her on the ground, cold and wet. She looks at him and again is horrified by his bloodied head. As he leaves and locks the door behind him, she knocks over the electric heater. Her hands still tied, she is left in tears, feeling she is soon going to die.Injured, Freddie manages to drive himself to a hospital, where doctors and nurses attend to him.In the basement, Miranda tries to cut the bindings loose from her hands. She is unable to do so. She grabs a blanket off the bed and wraps herself in it. She starts to cough.Three days later, Freddie drives himself home. Bringing a tray of food to the basement, he finds Miranda cold and shivering under the blankets. Although he cuts the bindings off her hands, he can barely look at her after what she did to him. Begging for him not to leave, she collapses on the floor. He goes over to her and carries her onto the bed. Barely conscious, she says that she is afraid to die. He professes his love for her. Seeing that she really is ill, he rushes off for a doctor, all the while leaving both doors open. From her bed, she can see the sunlight, meaning that the exterior door is open. She struggles to get out of bed.Freddie is in town and stops short of the doctor's office.He returns to the basement with pills in hand, the announcement that the doctor will soon be there, and that she will be better soon. But Miranda hears nothing as she is already dead. Freddie clutches his face in a short moment of grief. He goes over to the other side of the room, sits and watches her for the rest of the afternoon, reminiscing about every moment he has spent with her and absorbing the fact that death is forever.He buries her in a homemade coffin under an oak tree on his property.He contemplates the actions leading to her death and the role he may have played in her feeling like she needed to beat him with the shovel. But he comes to the conclusion that Miranda got everything she deserved. His mistake was aiming too high in choosing a girl outside of his social class. He should have chosen a girl who he could teach. As he thinks these thoughts, he drives down the street toward the nurse (Edina Roday) he met in the hospital."

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059749/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Instead of coming in from the Cold War, British agent Alec Leamas chooses to face another mission. Alec Leamas (Richard Burton), a British spy, is sent to East Germany, supposedly to defect, but in fact to sow disinformation. As more plot turns appear, Leamas becomes more convinced that his own people see him as just a cog. His struggle back from dehumanization becomes the final focus of the story.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> When an East German informant is killed at Checkpoint Charlie right before his eyes, Alec Leamas (Richard Burton), head of the Berlin station, returns to London headquarters. There his boss, Control (Cyril Cusack), enquires if he is tired, burnt out, ready to come in from the cold. Control suggests that there is a vacancy, a desk job, that might interest him, but Leamas declines adamantly. Thus, Control immediately mentions that he has something out of the ordinary in mind, to target a German Agent called Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck), who is systematically eliminating informants to the West.—alfiehitchie Alec Leamas (Richard Burton) is the operative for the British Secret Service overseeing the field Agents and their activities in Berlin. Recent activities in the field in Berlin and Alec's long-term status in the position make his London-based boss, Control (Cyril Cusack), openly wonder if Alec is burnt out and thus needs to come in from the cold to a London-based desk job. Alec's deteriorating state of mind is what Control wants the enemies to believe, as he asks Alec to do one last job out in the field. Alec is to pretend to become a drunkard who has left the agency due to his perceived failings in the job, working whatever odd jobs he can get, given his previous secret work. This change in attitude would make Alec ripe for turning information to the enemies. What Alec is supposed to do is implicate top East German Agent Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck) as a British double Agent, leading to Mundt being murdered by his own. The Brits expect Mundt's second in command, an East German Jew named Fiedler (Oskar Werner) who hates his ex-Nazi boss, to be the unsuspecting accomplice in this plan. Beyond the regular dangers in Alec being found out, or Mundt being able to convince his masters of his innocence, Alec faces one initially unintended obstacle, namely his relationship with a librarian named Nancy ""Nan"" Perry (Claire Bloom), whom Alec has met during his cover job as a library assistant. She is openly a member of the British Communist Party, but in her idealistic state, sees herself as drunkard Alec's savior. Alec wants to keep her out of what is occurring, which may be difficult, as both sides, while watching Alec's movements, will see their involvement with each other.—Huggo During the Cold War, operative Alec Leamas (Richard Burton) loses his last informant in East Berlin when he is shot while crossing the border. Leamas travels to London to meet his chief, Control (Cyril Cusack). They have a meeting, and Control asks him to lure the East Germans to make them believe that their Agent, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck) is a double Agent, and use Jewish Agent Fiedler (Oskar Werner), who is under the command of Mundt and hates him, to expose Mundt to get rid of him. Leamas poses as an alcoholic potential defector without any pension who finds a job in a library. Soon he becomes the lover of Nancy ""Nan"" Perry (Claire Bloom), who works with him in the library and belongs to the British Communist Party. Leamas is arrested for fighting in a store, and when he is discharged from jail, an East German Agent recruits him and sends him to the Netherlands. He is then taken to East Germany, where Leamas meets Fiedler, who uses his information to accuse Mundt. Afterward, Mundt is put before a tribunal, but out of the blue, his attorney summons a mysterious witness. Who might be this witness?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In West Berlin in the early 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, Alec Leamas is a spy in charge of British Intelligence operations in the city. However, his operatives have been hunted down and killed by Mundt, the head of East German counter-espionage. Leamas himself is present at Checkpoint Charlie near the Berlin Wall when he witnesses the last of his agents, Karl Riemeck, being killed as he attempts to escape to the West.Leamas is recalled to London by Control, the head of the ""Circus"" (slang for MI6, the British Intelligence service). Control makes little secret of the fact that he sees Leamas' career as over, however he is willing to keep him on for one last operation: to destroy Mundt, something which Leamas is only too happy to do.Leamas is later seen apparently out of the service and unemployed. He gets a job at a reference library and starts an affair with Nan Perry, another librarian and a member of the British communist party. Leamas gives the impression of a bitter, broken man and an alcoholic. He later assaults a grocer and spends time in prison.After his release from jail, Leamas is approached by a man called Ashe who claims to be part of a charity that supports ex-convicts. Leamas is quick to realise that Ashe and his associate Carlton are East German agents who want him to defect and provide information. Still a heavy drinker and desperate for money, he agrees.Leamas later visits George Smiley, another leading official in the ""Circus"", and there he meets Control who briefs him on what he is to tell the Germans. Leamas' defection is part of a long-term plan hatched by the British that will lead the East Germans to believe that Mundt is a traitor and will be executed by his own side.Travelling on a false passport, Leamas goes to Holland where he meets Peters, an East German Intelligence official. Leamas tells Peters about what he knows about the ""Circus"" and specifically about Operation ""Rolling Stone"" during which he made payments into Danish and Finnish banks under a false name. The money was later taken out by a ""business partner"", actually an agent working behind the Iron Curtain. Leamas later reads a newspaper article which shows that he is wanted by the police in England. He has no choice now but to agree to actually go to East Germany itself and is taken there by Peters.Leamas arrives at a compound where he meets Fiedler, Mundt's deputy in counter-espionage. It's well known that there is little love lost between Mundt, an ex-Nazi, and Fiedler, who is a Jew. Fiedler questions Leamas further about ""Rolling Stone"" and suggests that it was all about secret payments to a spy even higher up in the East German government than Karl Riemeck, who worked for the Presidium of the East German Communist Party. Leamas himself rejects this theory on the grounds that, as head of British Intelligence operations in Germany, he would have been told about all the agents working there.Meanwhile in London, Leamas' girlfriend Nan Perry is visited by George Smiley who claims to be a friend of Leamas. She is later invited to East Germany as part of an exchange program between the British and East German Communist Parties.One night, Fiedler and Leamas return to the compound where they are arrested by Mundt himself. However, Fiedler has already reported his own findings to the Presidium and Mundt is himself later arrested as a spy for the British.A secret tribunal is convened to determine Mundt's guilt. At the hearing, Fiedler outlines his case: in 1959, Mundt was part of a trading mission in London, a cover for intelligence work. He killed a man and escaped under the noses of the authorities. Fiedler claims that his escape was too easy and that he only got away when he agreed to supply information to the British, for which he was paid. Fiedler also points out that Karl Riemeck, a proven spy, rose high in the East German civil service thanks to Mundt, thus enabling them to gain access to secrets. When Riemeck came under suspicion, Mundt had him killed to protect himself. Another point is that the money from the bank accounts set up by Leamas in Helsinki and Copenhagen was withdrawn at times when Mundt is known to have been in those cities.When Leamas is asked to give evidence he again rejects the idea that Mundt was a spy for Britain because he - Leamas - would have been told. In answer to Mundt's lawyer, he denies ever meeting George Smiley.Mundt's lawyer, Karden, claims Leamas was set up by his boss, Control, to defect in order to frame Mundt and get him executed. He further reveals that Mundt's agents actually followed Leamas during his last days in London and that, although he gave them the slip, it was in the neighbourhood of George Smiley's residence.Leamas' girlfriend, Nan Perry, then appears in the court, having been lured to East Germany. Without knowing exactly what is going on, she is quizzed over her involvement. It's revealed that she now owns the lease on her rented flat due to an anonymous benefactor and that she was visited there by George Smiley. Karden persuades the court that Leamas did meet Smiley before he left London and set in motion a plan to discredit Mundt.In an attempt to try and get Nan out of trouble, Leamas quickly steps forward and admits that Karden is right about the British plan. Mundt is cleared and Fiedler and Leamas are arrested. Although Leamas hoped to get her released, Nan is also taken into custody.Leamas is taken back to his cell, but later hears the door being unlocked. Making his way out of the building to a back exit he meets Mundt. Nan is also there waiting next to a car. Mundt gives Leamas instructions on how to get to East Berlin and meet a contact who will get him over the Wall. His escape will give Mundt extra excuses to purge Fiedler and his associates and have them executed.During the journey by car, Leamas tells a confused Nan what's really been going on, the truth that he himself has only just realised: Mundt is a spy for the British and Fiedler was closing in on him. Rather than just have Fiedler killed, Smiley and Control decided to discredit him and his evidence as well. Leamas was used to make Fiedler's case and Nan to undermine it. Thus Fiedler will die for trying to incriminate a senior intelligence officer and Mundt will be able to resume his work as a double agent.When Nan berates him for causing the execution of Fiedler who was guilty of nothing, Leamas tells her that London needs Mundt in order to protect the West and the freedoms people like her take for granted:""What the hell do you think spies are? Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx? They're not. They're just a bunch of seedy, squalid bastards like me. Little men, drunkards, queers, hen-pecked husbands, civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives. Do you think they sit like monks in a cell, balancing right against wrong? Yesterday I would've killed Mundt because I thought him evil and an enemy, but not today. Today he's evil and my friend. London needs him. They need him so that the great moronic masses you admire so much can sleep soundly in their flea-bitten beds again. They need him for the safety of ordinary crummy people like you and me."" He also points out that her own Communist beliefs have their own share of evils: ""There's a few million bodies on that path.""In East Berlin, Leamas and Nan meet a contact who directs them to a section of the Wall over which they can escape to the West. But as they climb over it, the contact takes aim with a rifle and kills Nan, who now knows too much about Mundt to be kept alive.A shocked Leamas sees Nan collapse to the bottom of the Wall on the Eastern side. At that moment, Smiley himself calls from the Western side for Leamas to hurry and get over the Wall. Leamas instead climbs back down to the East German side and goes to Nan's lifeless body where he himself is shot dead."

[Synopsis by bj_kuehl]--------------------------KrystelClaire's synopsis:We begin with the 7:55 train for Bradley. Five very different gentlemen coincide in a coach. One of them is a weirdly mysterious tarot reader Dr Shreck (Peter Cushing), who seems to be checking his company. The initials in his briefcase read W. R. S.. Its contents fall to the floor, and Dr Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) wonders at the strange cards. Dr Shreck is a doctor in Metaphysics, and his surname means ""terror"", so he is the Dr Terror of the title. He says that he sometimes predicts horrible things, although he's an amiable person. These tarot cards predict the natural and the supranatural, and he Shreck calls them his ""house of horrors"". In spite of some of the disbelief, one of them decides to give it a go. After all, if it can't be changed it's better to know. Dr Terror tells him that he is a courageous man, and tells him to touch the tarot cards three times. Dr Terror shows four cards.Tale 1:  WereworlfMr Tod Callaghan (Edward Underdown)'s office. There are to architects in that office, him and Jim ""Jamie"" Dawson (Neil McCallum) and Mrs. Deirdre Biddulph (Ursula Howells) wants to make some structural changes to her new house. A hansom carriage takes him to the mansion. It's a misty night. Caleb (Peter Madden) welcomes Mr Jamie. Valda (Katy Wild) opens the door - she's Caleb's grandchild. They three used to know each other from childhood. Jim's family used to live there for centuries before, until they had to sell it. Deirdre used to be a doctor's wife, but now as a widow she's still beautiful. She wants to demolish a wall to create a bigger ballroom. She had suffered a nervous breakdown at her husband's funeral; he used to be an archaeologist, and she wants to make a museum in his honour.Jim hears an owl which interrupts their conversation, but can't see anything. Valda seems to be spying on him all the time. Caleb didn't grease a door to the basement. He notices scratches on a wall. There's a hidden room behind that plaster wall. Caleb says it's Cosmo Waldemar's coffin. Cosmo allegedly said that the Dawsons stole the mansion from him, and that one of them would take his place in his coffin; But that happened 200 years ago. In spite of that, the plaster looked new. They can't open the coffin, so they go to find another tool. Immediately, the coffin opens from the inside. The basement door is open and there are footprints on the floor but Deirdre didn't see anything leave the home.Valda leaves a note for Jim saying that she wants to talk with him. Caleb finds her immediately, dead. There are bloodstains which lead to the basement. Jim follows them to Cosmo's coffin. Jim tells Deirdre to lock herself in her bedroom. Jim will use a silver crucifix to make silver bullets for the gun which Caleb is going to lend to him. Deirdre is reading, and she is attacked by a wolf. Jim shoots it, but it runs away.It's Deirdre who's dangerous. Cosmo will live again when a descendant of the man who killed him will be in the coffin. She is Cosmo Waldemar's widow and has been loyal to him for 200 years.The fifth card is DEATH. Jim is nervous, because he's going to that same place. Mr Franklyn Marsh (Christopher Lee) is very cynic about it all, as he thinks that Dr Terror is just a smooth operator. He thinks that Dr Terror knew his name because he's a renown art critic. Another one says that he's never heard of him.Another candidate is Bill Rogers (Alan Freeman). Now he's going on a holiday with his wife and daughter, but when he returns...Tale 2: Creeping VineBill, Carol (Phoebe Nicholls) and Ann (Ann Bell) return home. The latter notices a new plant and tells Bill to kill it off before it affects her flowers. Bill can't cut the plant, and it looks like it screamed. Jerry Drake (Jeremy Kemp) is a botanist who's going to check it out. Carol plays with Rusty, the dog, and a ball. She goes to have tea, and leaves Rusty to pick up a small playball next to the plant. The plant kills Rusty, which was messing with the soil all over the place. Hopkins (Bernard Lee) makes a study about vegetable life; it must be a mutation which has given the plant some intelligence to protect themselves. They think it's a fantasy, but a plant like that could take on the world.Under the microscope, a brain is found in one of the plants. Carol won't play in the yard without Rusty. The plant attacks Jerry and strangles him. The vine cuts the phone wire and doesn't let anyone out. Ann holds Carol. The vine is all over the windows. Hopkins realises that the vine is afraid of fire when it tries to get away from a match he lights. Hopkins uses that to leave the home and call for help. However, the vine kills him and learns to put the fire out.Dr Horror has as the fifth card death's again. Marsh isn't courageous enough to touch the cards three times.Tale 3: VoodooWally (Russ Henderson) is a musician at a band; he plays the trumpet. The agent, Roy Shine (Harold Lang) sends him to Dupont, in the West Indies, where he'll play at the Flamingo. Sammy Coin (Kenny Lynch) is leaving, and the band is his replacement. The cigarette lady (Valerie St. Clair) has a huge weird ring. Everybody stares at Biff Bailey (Roy Castle) who is mocking voodoo. Sammy tells him not to mess with it, but Biff won't pay attention, and he sees the ritual. Cigarette girl is there, dancing and having a fit. Biff doesn't real that he's been surrounded by male dancers. Vrim (Christopher Carlos) is furious that Biff has written the music of the god Dambala (Thomas Baptiste). Vrim pushes Biff away. Biff says that he'll record the song when he's back in London. He's not afraid of Dambala, but at that moment the balustrade breaks under him, and he falls to a pond.Back in London, a musician (Tubby Hayes) tells him to be careful messing with voodoo. Biff and his band play a tune based on the voodoo rhythm. There's an image of Dambala as well. The breeze becomes wind, windows open, it becomes night, customers start to leave and panic spreads.

A group of spectators. a Lady (Faith Kent) tells Landor of what's happening. The painter goes out to talk to Marsh and question his authority to judge his black-and-white abstract etchings. The lady brings out a colourful painting, whom Marsh praises to no end: the balance, the colour, the brushwork, the humour of the whole composition. Landor shows him and the audience who painted everything: it was a monkey dressed in overalls and a navy t-shirt. A spectator (Pauline Chamberlain) laughs with a shrill voice.At a formal dinner, a toastmaster (Frank Forsyth) introduces Marsh, who has to give a speech, but Landor shows him cutouts of a monkey, and that makes Franklyn feel dizzy. In another exhibition, Landon inquiries about Marsh's opinions. Landon scares him away just for standing by his side. Marsh runs over Landor in purpose. At hospital, a nurse (Judy Cornwell) tells the surgeon that the patient is Eric Landor, the artist. The surgeon says ""not anymore"".

He gets home feeling very distressed. There are some knocks on the door, but nobody outside number 27. Marsh locks himself in without realising that the hand has crawled in. He tries to get his shit together until he feels the hand is grabbing one of his legs. He puts the dusty hand on the bonfire of his fireplace.The following day, the darkened hand crawls into his office and gets up into his table; then, it jumps to his neck to strangle it. Marsh uses a letter opener to stab the hand several times, and put it into a box. He wraps the box into a packet and throws it into a river. George and Franklyn drink at a pub. Another friend (John Martin) congratulates Franklyn in solving whatever problem was affecting him. It's a dark, rainy night when Franklyn leaves home, driving.Suddenly, the hand appears outside the windscreen holding onto a wiper. Franklyn's so startled that he steers like a madman and has a car accident. When the police and the ambulance arrive, a man (Walter Sparrow) comments that Franklyn won't die, but that he'll be blind forever. He comments that there are many things which a blind man can still do.The Franklyn Marsh in the train is startled about the story although he doesn't want to admit it. Dr Terror picks the death card again when he's questioned how to prevent this from happening.Tale 5: VampireDr Bob Carroll (Donald Sutherland) cuts himself with a can opener.

There, a boy called Johnny Barry (Frank Barry), feels week and has little blood. His mother, Mrs Ellis (Irene Richmond) said that it began suddenly. Blake comments like it looks as if a vampire has attacked Johnny while the nurse (Laurie Leigh) takes Johnny away. Bob mocks the notion in front of Nicholle, who takes things in her own hands.

He tells Bob that the bat didn't attack him because he did the sign of the cross with this arms.Blake wants to accompany Johnny while he sleeps with his window open, as he's seen two punctures in his neck. The bat appears and he shoots it.Bob wakes up and sees Nicholle who says that she's caught her hand when was about to close the window. Blake wants to put a wooden stick in Nicholle's heart, or, more precisely, he wants Bob to do it, as it'd be easier to do it. He notices the bat returning through the window and then Nicholle is there. Bob pretends to be sleeping, but says ""I love you"" to her.Cut to a police car with its sirens on. A detective (Al Mulock) listens to Bob's story with incredulity. Bob tells him that Dr Blake will confirm his story; but when he enters, he says it's a ridiculous excuse for having committed murder. Bob insists that he told him; Blake doesn't acknowledge to have been attacked. Bob is arrested on the spot. Blake stays behind and he says that the town is too small for two doctors... or two vampires.Dr Terror shows him his fifth card: death.Dr Terror touches the cards three times. He picks one and it's death as well. They realise that it's the train, which is going to have an accident. Marsh interrogates Dr Terror, asking who he is. He vanishes when they go through a dark tunnel.The five gentlemen are very satisfied: they have reached their destination without accidents. They get off, but the foggy atmosphere and void town looks unnatural. A used newspaper appears taken by the wind: TRAIN CRASHES - FIVE DEAD.

The Flight of the Phoenix,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059183/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After an oil company plane crashes in the Sahara, the survivors are buoyed with hope by one of the passengers, an airplane designer who plans for them to build a flyable plane from the wreckage. A cargo plane goes down in a sandstorm in the Sahara with less than a dozen men on board. One of the passengers is an airplane designer who comes up with the idea of ripping off the undamaged wing and using it as the basis for an airplane they will build to escape before their food and water run out.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> A routine flight in an old flying box car with a broken radio, carrying a group of tired men and worn out tools, encounters a fierce sand storm in the Sahara desert. The men are hundreds of miles from rescue, and nobody knows where they are. With zero chance of rescue and a 10 days supply of water, the group is forced to make a decision. Wait to die or build a flyable airplane using the salvaged parts of the wrecked flying boxcar. They hedge their bets by sending one person out with most of their water, on a trek for help. Then they start to plan and build a plane. One point of conflict is that the aeronautical engineer is German, and World War II is still fresh in everyone's mind. Lots of planning and luck enough to be carrying the basic tools on the plane to do the job. They start to cut up and build. Later the group learns that the engineer designs scale model planes, and second-guesses him. There is a small graveyard where after the crash they bury the victims of the crash and it keeps growing one man at a time during the story, adding a very stark reminder of the consequences of failure. Finally the project is to the point where take off can be attempted. They start the motor, and with a slow and laborious run the contrived contraption manages to take off and fly. We are reminded of a quote the pilot made in the beginning of the story."" I can remember when a pilot could just take pride in getting to the destination."" We are sure that was the case when they arrived in the home made plane. This story is so well told that there is a debate on if it is a true story or not. Be careful about claiming if it is or not."

Tied to stakes and forced to watch the dancing, they await their fate.—yusufpiskin The film opens to two muscle-bound men dressed in loincloths approaching a crypt. They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration.The opening credits feature the image of ""an immobile young woman clad in gold"". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff. The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his ""Princess of the Night"", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery. The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the woman dances, Bob and Shirley make their way to the cemetery and start observing the dance from a distance. Shirley suspects that they are observing a college initiation, though Bob seriously doubts her theory.The Emperor himself summons the third dancer, a woman who worshiped gold above else. The Golden Girl (Pat Barrington) dances in her turn, and the Emperor instructs his loin-clothed servants to reward her with gold. The supposed reward is soon revealed to be a punishment, as the servants place her in a cauldron with liquid gold. What emerges from the cauldron is a golden statue of the living woman who entered. The servants transport the immobile statue to a nearby crypt.At this point, a werewolf (John Andrews) and mummy (Louis Ojena) appear and seize the intruding young couple. They are brought before the Emperor who decides to postpone deciding their fate. The intruders are tied up, side by side, and allowed to continue watching the dances. The Black Ghoul next introduces the fourth dancer, a ""Cat Woman"" (Texas Starr). She is depicted as a woman dressed in a leopard costume, which exposes her chest area.

She draws a knife and seems about to kill Shirley, when the Emperor decides it is not yet time for the intruders to properly join them. The female ghoul reluctantly obeys.The Emperor is puzzled when a human skull appears instead of the next dancer. The Black Ghoul explains it is the symbol of the sixth dancer, who loved bullfighting and matadors. She used to dance over their demise, and now it's time to dance over her own. The dancer of apparent Spanish/Mexican heritage (Stephanie Jones) appears to perform. The Emperor and Ghoul briefly discuss the past of the dancer, who came to them on the Day of the Dead.The seventh dancer appears dressed in Polynesian garments. The Black Ghoul describes her as a worshiper of snakes, smoke, and flames. A rattlesnake is depicted along with her dance. The camera shifts to the mummy and the werewolf. The mummy voices his dislike of snakes and recalls the death of Cleopatra. He informs his companion that ancient Egypt had many snakes and they were the stuff of nightmares.
The Emperor next expresses his boredom and demands ""unusual"" entertainment, while the Black Ghoul notes that the night is almost over. She reminds her superior that they will be gone at the first sight of the morning sun. They proceed to argue over the fate of Shirley.The argument ends with the introduction of the eighth dancer (Barbara Nordin), a woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. She dances with the skeleton of her spouse. The argument over Shirley then resumes, as the Ghoul claims her for her own. The Emperor feels the need to assert his own authority over the Black Ghoul.The ninth dancer (Dene Starnes) was a zombie in life and remains zombie-like in death. The tenth and final dancer (Rene De Beau) is introduced as one who died for feathers, fur, and fluff. She starts her dance in clothing matching this style.

King Rat,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059358/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Fast-talking wheeler-dealer Corporal King is stuck in a Malaysian P.O.W. camp during World War II and uses bribery and larceny to take de-facto control of the camp. When Singapore surrendered to the Japanese in 1942, the Allied P.O.W.s, mostly British, but including a few Americans, were incarcerated in Changi prison. This was a P.O.W. camp like no other. There were no walls or barbed-wire fences, for the simple reason that there was no place for the prisoners to which to escape. Included among the prisoners is the American Corporal King (George Segal), a wheeler-dealer who has managed to established a pretty good life for himself in the camp. While most of the prisoners are near starvation and have uniforms that are in tatters, King eats well and and has crisp clean clothes to wear every day. His nemesis is Lieutenant Robin Grey (Sir Tom Courtenay), the camp Provost who attempts to keep good order and discipline. He knows that King is breaking camp rules by bartering with the Japanese, but can't quite get the evidence he needs to stop him. King soon forms a friendship with Lieutenant Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an upper class British officer who is fascinated with King's style and no-rules approach to life. As the story develops, it reveals the hypocrisy of the British class system and for King, the fact that his position in Changi's ""society"" is tenuous as best.—garykmcd The Japanese prisoner-of-war camp Changi in Singapore, which houses Allied P.O.W.s, is a living hell. The great mass of P.O.W.s are living at a sub-human subsistence level. U.S. Army Corporal King (George Segal) has been living up to his surname, through his control of the camp's black market, and by scamming the officers and other P.O.W.s. King has a facility for making deals with the Japanese to obtain the contraband he sells to the P.O.W.s. His nemesis is British Lieutenant Robin Grey (Sir Tom Courtenay), the camp Provost Marshal, a humorless, intense martinet who survives through his strict adherence to the British articles of war, which forbid collaboration with the enemy. He is suspicious of King, and is determined to catch him and bring him to justice. The humorless Grey is an upright, uptight moral prig who has been as badly damaged psychologically as any of the other P.O.W.s. The high-living King befriends a genteel young British airman, Peter Marlowe (James Fox), who at first, resists his blandishments, and then succumbs, to his charm. The P.O.W.s become aware that the war is drawing to its end, and King and Marlowe grow concerned that the brutal Japanese guards may slaughter the prisoners before they can be liberated. King and Marlowe are determined to raise a large amount of money to buy their freedom by bribing their captors. One of the schemes that King devises is to sell the meat of mouse deer, a native delicacy, to sell to the high-ranking P.O.W. officers. Conditions are so desperate in the camp, that P.O.W.s are stealing rations form one another in order to stave off starvation. This is another one of King's scams, as the ""mouse deer"" meat is actually from rats, the breeding stock for which have been the rats that have fed off the corpses of dead P.O.W.s. The desperate situation in the camp is exacerbated by the brutality of the Japanese guards, and by the senior British officers' predilection for breaking the will of the P.O.W.s in order to maintain camp discipline. Resistance, thus, is futile, and with no other outlet, the animosity of the P.O.W.s has to be channelled against each other. It becomes quite apparent that, aside from Lieutenant Grey and the dead, everyone in the camp is corrupt. Corporal King merely stands out, as he is Jack-the-Lad, The King-of-the-Hill, King of the Camp, King Rat.—Jon C. Hopwood George Segal plays Corporal King, an American soldier in a Japanese prison camp who manages all the black market operations amongst the enforced holding of a group of English and Americans. His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate. Theirs is a philosophy differing slightly and both based on survival with the most reaffirming respect for fellow man they can develop under these war conditions. As Grey attempts to arrest King and Marlowe for their criminal activity it becomes clear that the commanding officers live by a fractured value system."

The army sends reservists, mostly married middle-aged men - and the local beauty Andula, spurns those bold enough to try to win her, for the jazz pianist, newly come from Prague to perform. He seduces her and impresses her, telling her ""most women are round, like guitars but you are a guitar by Picasso"". Staying the night with him causes a lecture on a young woman's honour at her hostel so she throws over her other suitors and makes her way to Prague to find the young man. His protective Mamma and weary Pappa are not pleased when she arrives on the doorstep with her suitcase.—MK Andula works on the floor of a shoe factory in the provincial Czechoslovakian town of Zruc, and like most of her colleagues is young and female - the age and gender disparity due to conscription sending the young men into the military - and lives in the factory's hostel. She is somewhat innocent and naive when it comes to issues with the opposite sex, she easily falling in love or infatuation, such as with her current boyfriend Tonda, or reliving thoughts about a brief non-sexual encounter with a forest ranger. To boost morale among his young, female employees, the factory manager arranges for a social between them and a group of military reservists. While the social progresses to a point where it seems that she, and her two friends, Jana and Marie, are going to go off with three older and in their minds not really desirable reservists, Andula instead is whisked off by Milda, the Prague-based pianist who was playing with the musical combo at the social and who could witness the goings-on from his unique vantage point. While Andula doesn't totally trust Milda, she does end up spending the night with him. What is purely pillow talk on Milda's part, Andula takes as gospel. As such in combination with a talk to all the girls by their housemother, Andula unilaterally makes the decision to head to Prague to reunite with Milda, in the process she getting a life lesson about sexual relations among the young.—Huggo A working-class young woman in a hick Czech town sleeps with one of the band members of a group from Prague.

His factory is staffed entirely by 18-20 year old young women but all the boys their age have been drafted and sent to the border with West Germany anticipating war with the West. This has begun to cause ""morale problems"" at the factory. Hat in hand, he gets a meeting with the general staff and asks for help. The generals respond that they can't spare any of the young men because ""war may come."" The factory director responds, ""With all due respect, I appreciate your concerns but I have mine. And since it's been a while, may I ask, what if the war doesn't come? Can you do something to help me out?""Well, in a typical measured, _planned_, and regimented fashion, the generals decide to ""deploy"" a ""reserve unit"" of 40-something year old (mostly MARRIED) men to the next ""factory dance."" Well, the men are lost talking among themselves about how exactly they used to pick up girls ""back in the day,"" while the young women are not exactly thrilled being asked to dance with men who are as old as their fathers. The only young man at the dance is a jazz musician from Prague who's playing in the band. The Blonde protagonist of the story decides to take things into her own hands and talks him up ...Loves of a Blonde also features possibly the single most over the top sincere/heartfelt defence of ""a young woman's honor"" ever portrayed in cinema given by the ""comrade house mother"" responsible for the girls' dorm at the factory."

Red Beard,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058888/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 19th-century Japan, a rough-tempered yet charitable town doctor trains a young intern. It's the early nineteenth century, and young Dr. Noboru Yasumoto has been summoned for a reason unknown to him to rural Koishikawa Medical Clinic from Nagasaki, where he has been stationed for three years completing his internship. The clinic, headed by the outwardly stern Dr. Kyojô Niide - nicknamed ""Red Beard"" for that attribute - under his very strict guidelines, treats the poor and disadvantaged of the region. Much to his surprise and dismay, Yasumoto is told he is to start work there immediately, staff, including doctors, living on site. As he was expecting a position as a physician for a shogunate in his privilege, Yasumoto shows his displeasure at this fate at every turn. He believes this fate was either orchestrated directly by Red Beard in solely wanting access to his detailed professional notes - Yasumoto believing he a much better doctor than his new, more experienced superior - or by the father of a female acquaintance in an effort to get rid of him. Yasumoto may get a different perspective of life as a doctor at the clinic in getting to view Red Beard's methods first hand, as he gets to know the stories of some of the in-patients at the clinic, and as he is assigned his first patient, Otoyo, a twelve year old orphaned girl who was raised in an abusive brothel environment in an effort to seal her supposed future.—Huggo In a charity hospital, a hard-bitten but honorable older doctor, Dr. Niide, takes a young intern under his guidance through the course of a number of difficult cases.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> In the Nineteenth Century, in Japan, the arrogant and proud just-graduated Dr. Noboru Yasumoto (Yuzo Kayama) is forced to work in the Koshikawa Clinic, a non-profit health facility ruled by Dr. Kyojio Niide (Toshirô Mifune), a.k.a. ""Red Beard"". ""Red Beard"" is a good, sentimental, but also very firm, strong and fair man. While in the clinic, Dr. Yasumoto becomes responsible for healing the hurt teenager Otoyo (Terumi Niki), and he learns a lesson of humanity, becoming a better man.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil This Akira Kurosawa film tells the tale of young Dr. Yasumoto, a recent medical graduate assigned to a rural clinic for his post-graduate medical training. Yasumoto is condescending and arrogant--he is livid that he, who aspires to join the team of physicians caring for the Japanese Shogunate, should have to train in Dr. Niide's spartan clinic serving the impoverished local population. He finds Dr. Niide, known as 'Red Beard', a demanding taskmaster with a brusque manner and intense devotion to his patients. Niide requires nothing less than a monastic lifestyle of his interns. However, gradually Yasumoto is changed by his exposure to Red Beard. He learns the true meaning of being a doctor, seeing patients as real people who are suffering and as individuals whose lives he can improve and heal with his care.—Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> In 1820, young Dr. Yasumoto, returned to Edo after graduating from Dutch medical school in Nagasaki. He presented himself at the public clinic managed by Dr. Niide (Toshiro Mifune), aka Akahige (Red Beard- because of the color of his beard), thinking it was merely a courtesy call arranged by his father (who also a physician).To his surprise and displeasure, he found that out he was expected to work there for a while. Yasumoto didn't find anything to his liking. He found out that the doctors were expected to sacrifice sun (the patients needed the sunny rooms), heat (better for the soul), and tatami (Japanese comfortable bedding). Extremely upset & frustrated because he had hoped to find a prestigious post as a shogun's personal physician, Yasumoto rebelled by not doing what he was supposed to do and refusing to follow the rules. He would not wear the traditional clinic doctor's uniform, refused to eat, drank sake (though it was forbidden) and complained that the patients stank (which one of his colleague at the clinic called ""the smell of poverty""). He reclined on the lawn in front of an isolated ward reserved for a murderous female mental patient (which he had been warned to avoid). In short, he believed he was too good for this under-funded public clinic-that the job and patients were beneath him. His goal was to be asked to leave.One night, the mental patient escaped from her ward. Dr. Niide & nurse Osugi went out looking for her. The escaped patient (nicknamed the Mantis) showed up in Yasumoto's bedroom. She told Yasumoto the story of her life, how men had raped her many times, beginning at age 9. They threatened to kill her if she ever denounced them and she kept quiet. Finally, after a few years, she had had enough of the sexual abuse and snapped-- killing three men (thus the name Mantis). She was quite beautiful and Yasumoto succumbed to her charms. She seduced him, with the intention of killing him. Dr. Niide came back, just in time, to save him. Red Beard excused him for being drunk & for his weakness, as with all other men, because of her beauty and charm. According to Dr. Niide, the Mantis was just born that way.Little by little, Yasumoto started to integrate into the workforce at the clinic. For his 1st assistance in the operating room, he couldn't stand it & fainted. Yasumoto discovered that Dr. Niide, even though he looked stern & appeared difficult, had a kind heart. He managed to get a bit of money to help a patient's destitute daughter with 3 small children (the old man just passed away before her arrival). He gave her 5 ryos (1 gold ryo = USD$150 today). Later he said that he was able to get that money from the magistrate, because he knew the judge had a mistress on the side. Hinting that he might make this information public, Red Beard was able to get the charges against her for attacking her husband dropped. Gradually, Yasumoto started to put on the uniform.When Dr. Niide learned that funds for the clinic were being cut by the government, he was very unhappy. With Yasumoto in tow, he paid a visit to an obese wealthy lord. He ordered a lean diet for the man & charged him 50 ryos, instead of the usual fee of 30. On the way back to the clinic, they paid a visit to a brothel to see a patient with syphilis. There they discovered the madam & her servant were getting a 12 year old girl ready, by way of beating, to receive customers. Dr. Niide had to use force to defeat a dozen thugs working for that madam in order to bring the girl, Otoyo, to the clinic, and begin healing her.He assigned Yasumoto to care for the girl. She was to be his first official patient. Not only was she physically sick (with a fever), she manifested abnormal mental behavior as well (wiping the floor without stopping when she was not feverish, not speaking, and refusing kindnesses). At first Otoyo was resistant, but gradually with Dr. Niide's patience, she started to accept treatment (drinks & medications).Meanwhile, Yasumoto had a visitor named Masae. She was Yasumoto's ex-fiancee's (Chiugas) sister. At first, he refused to see her. But one day, Masae waited for Yasumoto at the gate, hoping to see him. This time he agreed to talk and invited her inside. Seeing Otoyo wearing a torn and weathered kimono, Masae brought her some nice clothes. But Otoyo was not happy with them, because she realized that Masae drew away Yasumoto's attention. In a jealous rage, she threw the new clothes into the mud. She was scolded by the female orderlies. Dr. Niide told them that this was actually a good sign. He could see that Otoyo's love for Yasumoto was her first step in being able to see good in people and overcoming the mistreatment she had experienced. He knew that with time, she would be able to love others as well.One day, while Osugi was having an intimate moment with another doctor at the clinic, the madwoman tried to hang herself. The Mantis' father came & scolded Osugi severely. Dr. Niide came to her defense & reprimanded the father for not caring enough for his daughter, allowing strangers to take advantage of her, causing her illness.One day, a 7 year old beggar boy named Chubo, snuck into the clinic kitchen, trying to steal some gruel. Otoyo befriended him, gave him food, and pleaded with him not to steal anymore. Some time later, the boy came to say goodbye, saying he, his parents, and 2 brothers were leaving for a better place. Otoyo was too young to suspect anything, believing they had some rich relatives who could help them out.

In the US version they are listed by more American-sounding names. Below they are listed by their real Italian names.**Muriel Hampton Arrowsmith (Barbara Steele) has entered the lab of her husband Dr. Stephen Arrowsmith (Paul Muller) with a drink. He chastises her for entering without permission, commenting on her drinking. She acknowledges that he is leaving for a scientific conference where he will be with other fanatical good-for-nothings like yourself she taunts. He tells her not to speak to him like that. She reminds him that she is his wife and would like to spend the night with him. They kiss. Muriel notices that this has been observed by Solange (Helga Liné), who is waiting to see him off on his long journey. They say their goodbyes and he tells her he will only be a couple of days gone. The carriage is brought up by David (Rik Battaglia) who asks about the new plants. He is told to water them in the greenhouse. Dr. Arrowsmith leaves.Muriel goes to the piano and plays music. Hearing this, David drops what he is doing and heads into the house to meet her. Muriel disrobes, puts on her nightgown and perfume and begins passionate kissing with David, which progresses to the bed. She stops, suggesting they are too near Solanges room and they should go to the greenhouse. Once there, they lie down and begin passionate kissing.Outside we see Dr. Arrowsmith waiting and watching for a signal from Solange. From an upstairs window we see a light flashing back and forth. Holding his cane, he enters the greenhouse and confronts the lovers. He strikes David in the face with his cane, then his wife. Next we see both of them strung up on a wall with Stephen whipping them. He uses a heated poker on David. Next we see Stephen pouring a glass of water from a pitcher. Both look thirsty and Muriel begs for a sip. He brings it close, then pours it out. She curses him with her hatred, but then confesses that she recently remade her will, leaving all her wealth to her step-sister Jenny.Stephen is pouring through a book, presumably a law book, as he plans what he will do. Solange tells him he will have to keep her alive, but that Solange wants her share of the money that he has promised her. He reassures her that he will win and Solange will get what is coming to her. Then he says Jenny will inherit the money, but everyone knows Jenny is mad. She will be confined to a mental hospital and he will discover the cure.Next we see Muriel and David in the bedroom with Muriel chained to the bed and David chained to a chair. Stephen drips acid onto Muriel from a contraption and she cries out. David cries out as well, seeing her suffer. Stephen releases him from the chair and he rises, to be pushed onto the bed with her. Still shackled on his feet with wires connected, Stephen turns on a switch which electrocutes them both in bed. They cry out.Stephen is seen removing her heart from her corpse, which he places in a water tank along with the heart of David. Next we see her ashes placed in an urn with a strange plant.Stephen arrives at the castle with Jenny, who he has just married, having gotten her from the asylum. Solange is annoyed that he married her against their plan. He consoles Solange (who appears years younger) that once Jenny is insane enough to commit that he will be named over her estate and then Solange will get her money. In the meantime, he will see to it that Jenny goes mad.He prepares a hallucinogen to be added to Jennys drink which Solange adds. That night Jenny hears two hearts beating and gets up. She opens a door to find wind and a laughing woman's voice. Seeing the plant, which has almost bloomed, she notices drops of blood beside it. She gets back in bed with Stephen, who pretends to be asleep. Later she tells him about her dream and the blood. He tells her it is only a nightmare.Jenny and Stephen are seen at a fountain with white doves. Jenny asks questions about Muriel and Stephen fills her in. She apologizes to Stephen for her outburst last night. He tells her if could be nothing other than delirium, which he hopes will not happen again. Solange comes to tell him that the lab is ready. He goes with her, leaving Jenny at the fountain.In the lab, he finds that one vial is still present in the cabinet: the vial of hallucinogen that Jenny was supposed to have received last night. Solange apologizes and says it couldn't be. He insists otherwise, but tells her that regardless, Jenny seems to not need the drug to go over the edge. He kisses Solange.Jenny finds the sheet music on the piano and asks if Muriel wrote it. She is told that Muriel occasionally did write music. Jenny attempts to play the theme. As the music plays, she seems to become more like Muriel and asks for a drink. The servant brings it, and she remarks that she likes it. Stephen throws down a medical journal that he doesn't care for and complains about the doctor who wrote it. After the music has stopped, he notices that Jenny is gone. He and Solange go to her room, but she is not there. Then a scream is heard. Solange says that it comes from below. They head toward the passage leading down to the crypt. Another scream is heard before they reach it. At the bottom of the stairs, they push open a door to find Jenny white as a ghost, collapsing. Stephen carries her up to her bed. They discuss what happened and she cannot remember parts of it, only that her hands were bloody and she tried to remove the covering to the crypt. He tells her it was all in her imagination. She insists that the door to the crypt was locked, but he says no, it was easily opened when he pushed on it. He tells her that her condition frequently causes things to seem impossible. She begs him not send her back to the asylum and he agrees, but tells her he wants her to get better. Dr. Joyce (Marino Masé) will come and take care of her, since he did for so many years at the hospital.When Dr. Joyce arrives, he is greeted by Stephen and Jenny, who tries to sweep him away to the woods. Stephen intervenes, suggesting that the doctor has just arrived. Dr. Joyce says it is all right, but Jenny agrees that her husband is right, leaving and going inside.Dr. Joyce talks to Jenny about remembering all that has happened to her. He says Stephen has told him everything that has happened recently. She remembers something about David but gets confused. He asks what happened. She tells him that someone else takes over her mind and that then she gets confused. She remembers the crypt and the greenhouse, so they go there in an effort to remember. She says someone was kissing her, but she cant remember who. Someone else came in and struck him. She tells Dr. Joyce that she lost an earring which should be in the leaves below. When he finds it, she seems to recognize it but then when questioned further becomes confused. He suggests maybe she lost it another time. Then she admits that it is not her earring and she has never seen it before.In Dr. Arrowsmiths study, Solange breaks a bottle and he chides her, telling her he was able to restore her youth but not her mind. She reminds him that it is not her mind that he needs. Dr. Joyce comes in to discuss Jennys condition, showing him the earring that she found in the greenhouse. Stephen tells Solange to go find the other earring in Jennys room. Going to a secret location, Solange gets the other earring and goes to Jennys room (which Stephen says has changed per Dr. Joyce). She slips it into the jewel box and tells Jenny the Doctor wants to see it. When Jenny shows her jewelry to Dr. Joyce, she finds the other earring and becomes confused. Stephen brings over the other one, explaining that they are Muriels earrings and that Jenny has never worn them. Confused, she leaves the room.At dinner, Dr. Joyce is discussing wizards and witches of Africa who made contact with the dead, when suddenly Jenny rises, announcing she is tired and will turn in. Stephen tells her he will follow immediately. Jenny leaves and the doctors discuss her condition. All at once Solange cries out, having apparently cut herself. Stephen attends to her, telling Dr. Joyce he will have to take her to the lab to prevent a hemorrhage. He explains that she has a rare blood disorder but that it is nothing. As they leave the room, Dr. Joyce notices her place at the table, looking closely at it. The butler comes in and asks if he wants anything, to which he replies no. Announcing that he will go to his room, he leaves. The butler also looks at the place he was looking.Upstairs, Dr. Joyce finds his room locked and knocks, asking who is there. Behind him there is a noise and he looks around to find a passageway opening in a panel in the wall. He goes through.In the lab, Stephen tells Solange that they will need new blood. He draws some from a container and gives her an injection. He says this worked for now but soon they will need some new solution.Jenny awakens to the sound of the hearts beating. She hears Muriels voice telling her that her blood is being used down in the laboratory and to hurry. Jenny gets up and begins to go.Dr. Joyce finds himself in the crypt looking at graves. He finds Muriels crypt and the lid slides over, revealing it to be empty.Jenny enters the lab and picking up a scalpel, he goes to attack Stephen, who is attending to Solange. Solange cries out as she sees her coming. Striking his face with the scalpel, Jenny renders a cut on Stephen just as Dr. Joyce enters. He takes Jenny back to her room. Solange tells Stephen that it was not the face of Jenny but Muriel.In her room, Jenny draws Dr. Joyce to sit in bed with her. He speaks to her and she looks strangely at him, asking who he is. She tells him she is not Jenny, but Muriel and kisses him. Again he calls Jenny and she kisses him again. Suddenly the doors fly open and a breeze blows through. Seeing no one, Dr. Joyce returns to Jenny, who asks if he saw what she saw. He tells her that he will find out what it was. In the greenhouse, Jenny asks the doctor what Muriel wants with her. He tells her that she must leave these surroundings in order to get better.Solange tells Stephen that the doctor is now a threat and cannot be allowed to leave the castle. He agrees with her. At that moment Dr. Joyce enters and asks to speak to him. Solange leaves. He tells Stephen that he will take Jenny back to the clinic in the morning so she can get better. Stephen agrees and Dr. Joyce retires to his room, beginning to write. Next he calls the butler to prepare his bath. Meanwhile Stephen drills a hole in the wall in the bathroom and connects wires to electrocute Dr. Joyce when he steps into the tub. Before Joyce can do that, the butler returns with towels and fixes them on a rack by the tub. As he brushes by the tub, he accidently knocks the soap bar into the water. Hearing activity, Stephen prepares to throw the switch and does. When he reaches for the soap he cries out as he is electrocuted. Dr. Joyce removes him and next they are seen discussing his death. Joyce pronounces a heart attack and Stephen tells Solange to take Jenny away.Stephen asks Joyce to prepare a death certificate and help move his body back to his room. When that is done, Joyce wants to light a candle for the dead while Stephen leaves. After they both leave the room, the butlers hand falls to the side, revealing a burn on his wrist from the electric shock.Solange meets Stephen in the hall, confessing she is frightened and uncertain of what to do now. He reassures her everything will go as planned. He goes to speak to Jenny, telling her she has been through a shock. She says she is anxious to leave in the morning with Dr. Joyce. At this point he turns on her, accusing Dr. Joyce of manipulating her because she is weak, beautiful and rich. She swears he has done nothing wrong and that they have been friends for many years. He tells her he saw them holding hands in the greenhouse and that he doesn't want to lose her. He persuades her to come with him to Spain or Italy and she agrees.Next we see Dr. Joyce reluctantly telling Jenny that it will be good for her to go elsewhere. She acts as if he might be talking down to her. He tells her he will be leaving in the morning, but that he is very fond of her and if she ever needs anything for her to call upon him. She cries.That night she is dreaming as Muriel again and Dr. Joyce comes in and observes her as she writhes. He asks if it is Muriel and asks where her body is and who killed her. When Stephen comes into the room, he hides behind draperies. Jenny screams when she sees Stephen.Solange begs Stephen for the blood of Jenny to replenish her, saying that Muriels blood is heavy within her, like mercury. He promises that Jennys blood will be available soon.Next morning Dr. Joyce is saying goodbye when Jenny approaches and asks why he is leaving. She asks him if he likes the Hampton Crest which is at the base of a statue of two lovers. She seems more like Muriel. He bids them goodbye and leaves. Solange seems in pain waiting for the new blood.Jenny is seen in her room, packing. Thunder is heard outside. Jenny approaches Stephen and calls him. He comes toward her with a murderous look and slaps her down. Grabbing her, he tells Solange to come to the lab. Meanwhile in the rain we see Dr. Joyce who has returned and enters the castle. Inside, he looks at the Hampton Crest, finally turning it clockwise, which opens a cabinet door. Inside is the container with the two hearts of Muriel and David. He carries it to the desk and removes the dagger. The cries of Muriel and David are heard by Dr. Joyce and seen looking down from a high position.In the lab Stephen tells Jenny that her sister is calling her and that we will no longer have to deal with hearing her cries anymore. Solange cries out that she cant stand it. Stephen brings cotton dipped in ether and puts Jenny to sleep. Solange is told to lie on the other berth. After they are connected with tubes, Stephen tells Solange it will take about two hours and for her to remain still while he prepares for the trip the three of them will make.Stephen comes out and sees Muriel and David with their wounds, facing Dr. Joyce. Stephen hits Joyce from behind with a candlestick, knocking him out. Muriel takes Stephen aside, telling him she will help him see the ecstasy of pain and death that she has. As he pulls her hair aside, he sees her hideously deformed face. She laughs and secures him in the chair, throwing a candle and setting him on fire. Meanwhile David enters the lab and Solange, seeing him, screams. He cuts the blood line, laughing, and it drips on the floor. Next we see Stephens chair with his body completely burnt up. Muriel stops laughing. Solange is shown back in her old body again as David laughs, destroying the lab equipment. Next we see Solange as only a skeleton.Dr. Joyce recovers and stands up. David approaches Jenny on the table and shakes her. She awakens and screams. At this point Dr. Joyce comes in and pulls David away into the lab which is filling with smoke. He picks Jenny up and carries her out. Upstairs they lock the doors to keep David out and turn to run. Jenny is horrified to see Muriel coming toward them. David breaks the doors open and comes in. At this point Dr. Joyce takes the two hearts and throws them into the fire. As they burn, Muriel and David disappear. Dr. Joyce and Jenny run outside into the rain. As they pause and look back, he tells her she is safe now and will have no more problems from Muriel. The two hearts are shown again burning in the fireplace."

The sub they are tracking can only stay under for a maximum of 24 hours and Finlander has every intention of being right there when it has to surface. With the ship on what is essentially a constant war footing, the officers and men are always on edge. Mistakes are inevitable.—garykmcd An American news writer assigned to interview the captain of the destroyer USS Bedford bears witness to a stunning game of cat and mouse in the frigid waters of the northern Atlantic. A Soviet submarine has been tailing the Bedford and the captain of the Bedford turns tail to confront the Soviet sub. As the cat-and-mouse pursuit continues, the Bedford's captain becomes more obsessed with the Soviet sub, until an accident involving one of his increasingly shaken crewmen leads to a confrontation no one wants, and that no one can win.—Michael Daly As the United States and Soviet Union warily eye one another during the Cold War, the destroyer USS Bedford is on patrol in the North Atlantic Ocean. A Navy helicopter ferries two men out to the ship in mid-ocean. One is civilian photo-journalist Ben Munceford (Sidney Poitier); the other is new ship's medical officer Commander Chester Potter (Martin Balsam). It is immediately obvious how tightly the ship is run by its skipper, Captain Eric Finlander (Richard Widmark).The hard-boiled captain seems to take an immediate dislike to both new arrivals. Commander Potter is a Reserve Naval Officer, making him suspect with Finlander. Munceford's pointed questions and persistent meddling also rankle the captain. Finlander runs his ship under wartime conditions, keeping his men on a razor's edge.Potter and Munceford are soon introduced to Commodore Wolfgang Schrepke (Eric Portman), a former Kriegsmarine U-boat officer serving as a NATO technical adviser aboard the Bedford. The Bedford is operating in the Denmark Strait, between Greenland and Iceland. Finlander is tracking a specific Russian submarine nicknamed ""Big Red"" and watching several possible ""mother ships"" in the area, in hopes of coming upon the rendezvous between submarine and supply ship. The Russian supply ship is soon identified as the Novo Sibursk.Finlander's iron discipline seems to fall most heavily on young Ensign Ralston (James MacArthur), a former star quarterback whose earnestness and desire to please annoys Finlander. The Executive Officer, Commander Buck Allison (Michael Kane), warns Finlander that he is being too hard on Ralston. He is becoming jumpy and prone to mistakes.While skirting the edge of the ice shelf, the Bedford's lookouts spot the periscope and snorkel of a Russian sub. Bedford's bookish sonar operator, Queffle (Wally Cox) reports that the Russian sub is two miles inside Greenland's territorial waters. Finlander immediately seeks a confrontation, asking NATO for permission to force the sub to the surface. NATO refuses Finlander's request. Incensed, he maintains battle stations. Even though Big Red steers back into international waters, Finlander keeps the pressure on the submarine. The submarine crew is slowly running out of air, and Finlander wants to be there when she surfaces.Munceford eventually secures a private interview with Finlander. He tries to badger Finlander into saying something rash about attacking the enemy, but Finlander doesn't take the bait. Finlander's pursuit of Big Red now becomes a dangerous obsession. Finlander belatedly gets permission to force the sub up, providing it is still in territorial waters, but the Russian vessel has eluded him in a field of icebergs. Despite Schrepke's stern advice to stand down and de-escalate, Finlander keeps pressing. He is rewarded when the desperate Russian submarine commander briefly comes to periscope depth. Schrepke warns Finlander that the sub is now in international waters and the crew in desperate need of air. He is dealing with a desperate quarry, and the results could be unpredictable and tragic. Schrepke bluntly tells Finlander that he finds him frightening.When the Russian sub fails to respond to Finlander's order to surface immediately, Finlander steers for the submarine's periscope and air snorkel, intending to pass directly over it. Contact is made, however. Both Schrepke and Munceford plead with Finlander to back off, telling him that he is forcing the Russians to fight. Finlander is undeterred, ordering a nervous Ensign Ralston to arm the ASROC rocket-propelled torpedo system. As the pressure-charged situation intensifies, Schrepke begs Finlander once again for restraint. The reckless captain replies, ""Don't worry, Commodore. The Bedford will never fire first. But if he fires one, I'll fire one."" Hopelessly rattled from Finlander's constant barking, Weapons System Officer Ralston complies with the order he thought he just heard. ""Fire One!"" Ralston triggers the firing switch. The ASROC roars from its tube as Finlander and Allison leap across the bridge in hopes of disarming it. They are too late. The torpedo arcs high into the sky before plunging into the sea. Seconds later, a tremendous explosion confirms the submarine's destruction. All eyes turn accusingly to Finlander. There is only stunned silence on the Bedford's bridge. Suddenly, the sonar operator frantically reports a spread of four torpedoes bearing down on the Bedford. The Russian sub had fired her torpedoes defensively as soon as the ASROC broke the surface. Finlander orders emergency evasive maneuvers and countermeasures, but it is too late. The nuclear-armed torpedoes streak remorselessly toward Bedford, which is soon enveloped in a mushroom cloud."

When he tries to get a cab ride, the cabbie refuses to take him to the Witley place. He goes over to a local storefront and asks for the Witley place. A man and woman refuse to help and leave, giving him odd looks. The woman stops and informs a group of old men that he is coming and leaves. When Stephen asks about renting a car, he is told that he might be able to rent a bicycle. When he tells them he is going to the Witley place, they laugh and repeat what he says. No one will tell him why the subject is taboo.At the bicycle shop the proprietor refuses to rent anything when he finds Stephen is going to the Witleys. He is advised to walk there.Going along dirt roads, Stephen passes a barren wasteland with a tar pit. All the trees in the area look burnt to a crisp. He pinches off part of a small branch and notices it is completely burned up.Arriving at the Witley gate, he finds it padlocked with signs saying TRESPASSING FORBIDDEN. Looking for a way in, he finds a large trap set. Using his briefcase to spring the trap, he steps over it and into the Witley property. The entire area is smoky and hazy, with an eerie quality. As he approaches the huge house, a dark figure cloaked in black watches.He knocks upon the door, getting no response. He knocks again and the double doors open on their own. He enters and looks around. His footsteps echo on the stone floors. He calls Hello a couple of times to no response. Suddenly a large grandfather clock chimes. The clock shows 4:15.He turns and sees Nahum Witley (Boris Karloff) staring at him from a wheelchair. Stephen apologizes and tells Witley that he took the liberty of coming in when there was no response. Witley questions what business a stranger has coming in unannounced and uninvited. Stephen produces a folded letter which he gives to Witley, explaining that he has been invited by Mrs. Witley. Merwyn the butler (Terence de Marney) watches. Witley remarks how his daughter Susan (Suzan Farmer) has mentioned his name. After discussing how Stephen and Susan met in college in America, Witley tells him he must leave. Stephen says it is not Mrs. Witley he is here to see but Susan. At this point Susan calls out from the top of the stairs and runs down to greet Stephen. Witley says for Stephen to tell her that he must leave at once and cannot explain why at this time. He tells Merwyn to get the car ready.Susan is overjoyed to see Steve and invites him up to meet her mother. Witley insists that it is forbidden for his wife to have visitors. Susan says its only for a few minutes and that her mother has been waiting to meet him. As they go upstairs, she shows him a portrait of her great grandfather who built the house over 150 years ago. The next portrait is of her grandfather whom she says went insane. Witley, watching them go upstairs, says to Merwyn that Stephen must not stay.Susan explains to Stephen that her mother is not well. They enter and she addresses her mother, Letitia Witley (Freda Jackson), who tells them to come in and close the door. They approach the bed which is shrouded in netting. Susan introduces Stephen and Letitia tells him that he is expected and welcome. She asks to speak to Stephen alone and Susan exits. Letitia tells Stephen to sit down and he does so.Meanwhile Witley descends on an old elevator with a pulley chain. Merwyn meets him at the bottom and wheels him through dark corridors. At one point Merwyn almost collapses and Witley asks if hes all right. He answers that he is and that he can be trusted.Stephen asks why all the questions. Letitia tells him to come close and take a wooden box by the bed. Inside is a golden earring which she says belonged to her maid who came down with a strange disease. It is explained that the disease caused her to hide under a veil and not want anyone to see her.Witley and Merwyn go through an underground chamber containing a vertical door laden with cut squares from which steam escapes around the sides. Witley rummages through a box with chains and random machine parts but finds nothing he wants. He goes to another spot and recoils when he sees a rat there.Letitia tells Stephen that the maid came back to see her and said she was afraid of what she had become. She dropped the earring as she was leaving and has not been seen since. Letitia wants Stephen to promise to take Susan away the next day.Witley and Merwyn are seen chaining up the door to a greenhouse. Stephen comes out and tells Susan he has the mothers blessing. She shows him his room, where he asks how long the mother has been sick and if the doctor had forbid her to have visitors. Susan explains that it has only been a few weeks and that Witley refused to let her see a doctor. Stephen asks about the maid, whom he says the mother was very concerned about. She asks what else they talked about. He tells her that her mother was interested in whether or not his intentions were honorable. They kiss, which is observed by Witley, who is sneaking a look from the door.Witley goes and tells his wife that she should not have invited Reinhart there. There is talk about how evil the grandfather was, but Witley explains that he has long been dead and that the evil is buried with him. She says how much he has become like his father, who consorted with demons. He denies being like his father, claiming it is she who is obsessed with the subject. He pours himself a drink, saying that whatever happened to his father will not happen to him. She says its already happening and that she witnessed the elder change from an upright God-fearing man to one possessed by the devil. She insists than Corbin was calling upon the dark forces at the time of his death and now they are here. She wants Stephen to take Susan away. He wants Stephen to leave and not interfere. She threatens to go into town and show everyone what the former beauty Letitia Witley looks like now. He agrees that Stephen can stay one night, but no more.Merwyn is serving soup to Witley, Susan and Stephen at a dining table. He clumsily almost drops the soup in front of Witley and apologizes. Stephen sips his soup and looks around curiously. Susan smiles at him. Witley looks very concerned and shows no appetite. Trying to make conversation, Stephen remarks how big and regal the room is. Susan says there used to be banquets there in her great grandfathers time. There have been none in her recent memory. Stephen asks why and Witley says that the name of Witley no longer commands the respect it once did. Stephen says that must be why no one in the village would have anything to do with them. Witley agrees and says the feeling is mutual. He asks if Mrs. Witley has had her supper. Merwyn says he took up a tray but she wouldnt touch it. Susan offers to take something up to her mother later.At this point a horrible shriek is heard echoing through the house. Stephen asks what it was but Witley doesnt answer. So Stephen asks about the burned area. Witley remains silent, but Susan tells him that there was a fire. She admits she hasnt seen it, because her father has forbidden her to go to the heath. Stephen says nothing grows there and how strange it is. Witley repeats that Susan has already told him that a fire was there. Stephen responds that no fire leaves an area like that. Susan says a few villagers disappeared in that area.Merwyn, who has been carving meat, brings some to the table and collapses on the floor, pulling the tablecloth and dishes off. They crowd around him and Stephen asks whats wrong. Witley tells him that he knows exactly what to do and that this has happened before. He tells Susan to take Stephen out of the room.Later, Susan takes a tray of food to her mother, who refuses to eat. Letitia tells Susan to be quiet and listen. Nothing is heard, but Letitia answers  yes. Yes.  as if answering someone.Stephen looks through an old book in the library. He hears a noise behind him but sees no one. He picks up another large old book. It bears the name of Corbin Witley and the title  CULT OF THE OUTER ONES.  Another pages states:  CURSED IS THE GROUND WHERE THE DARK FORCES LIVE, NEW AND STRANGELY BODIED. HE WHO TAMPERS THERE WILL BE DESTROYED.Susan, in her room, turns and is horrified to see the black figure looking in at her from the window. She screams and runs to Stephens room. Hearing the scream, he leaves the library and also goes to his room. She rushes to his arms and tells him of someone looking at her from the window. He asks if she was imagining it. She wearily answers that she doesnt know. She says that there is something smothering about the house. He tells her that he is taking her away and they embrace. He suggests they leave tonight. She insists that she cant leave her mother in such a weakened condition. He reminds Susan that it was her mother who asked him to take her away. He says tonight but she refuses. Then he says first thing in the morning. She answers that her mother may not be any better then. Suddenly the figure appears at the window and she calls out. When Stephen looks, the figure has moved on. He suggests it is her imagination and tells her to get some sleep before tomorrow. They kiss.A candle is extinguished by a black and gnarly hand as the lights go out in the mothers room. Stephen is back reading from the old book when he hears another shriek. He goes to investigate and Susan joins him in her nightgown and robe, carrying a candle. He tells her it came from downstairs.As they descend the staircase, another anguished cry is heard echoing through the house. They go further in the darkened house and hear something falling. As they pass by a fireplace, a burnt log falls out. They continue on to a door and Stephen asks what room it leads to. Susan tells him it is Merwyns room. They open the door and creep in. They come to another door, and just as Stephen is about to grab the doorknob, it opens to reveal Witley, who appears distraught. He tells Susan that they shouldnt have come down here. Stephen said they heard the screams. Witley tells them that is was Merwyn, who is now dead. Stephen wants to know how he died and see the body, but Witley refuses, saying he will run his own household. Stephen insists that a man has died, but Witley closes the door behind him, and Susan pulls him away. Inside, Witley pours a glass of wine and drinks it.Stephen tries to insist that they leave immediately, but Susan refuses. After she goes back to her room, Stephen goes back downstairs. He sees Witley rolling the body of Merwyn out of the house and into the greenhouse. Witley is standing as he moves the body inside.Stephen enters Merwyns room and looks around. On the floor he sees what looks like burn marks in the shape of a body. He goes outside and sees Whitley digging a grave. Going to the glowing greenhouse, he finds it padlocked. He leaves before Witley can get there. Witley checks the greenhouse door and finds it still locked. Stephen runs back into the house and climbs upstairs. Witley follows. Blowing out the candle in his room, Stephen gets under the covers in bed and pretends to be asleep when Witley looks in on him. Coming alongside the bed, Witley reaches to grasp the candlestick, but a noise is heard as of something falling. Witley leaves the room and Stephen gets up and closes the door.Stephen goes out at first light onto the grounds. The black figure is seen and a shriek is heard. The figure attacks Stephen with a knife and he sees that the face is distorted and freakish. He escapes the attack and the figure leaves.Stephen goes into town and enters a phone booth but only looks in the phone book. Having located a doctor, he goes to the doctors house and is admitted. Dr. Henderson (Patrick Magee) comes in and begins drinking. He explains that he has been retired for some time. Stephen wants to know why everyone is afraid of the Witleys. Henderson refuses to talk about it and tells him to leave. On the way out, the woman Miss Bailey tells him that Corbin Witley died in Dr. Hendersons arms. There was no autopsy, no body, and no one saw him but Dr. Henderson. He was never the same after that and retired.Susan tries to get her mother to open the bedroom door, but there is no answer. Witley comes and sends her away. He tries to convince Letitia to open up. Inside we see that the room is in shambles, clothing strewn all around on the floor and furniture turned over.Susan and Stephen walk outside and he tells her about the glowing light inside the greenhouse. He says it resembled something he saw once in a radiation lab. He tells her that he saw Witley burying Merwyn last night. He also is sure that the black figure who attacked him was the maid Helga. He says the greenhouse is padlocked. They go there.Witley speaks to his wife through the door, telling her that he will take her to the doctor. She is seen cowering in the corner of the room, moaning. As she turns, we see that half of her face is deformed.Seeing that the greenhouse is locked up, Stephen asks if there is another way in. She is reluctant, but he convinces her it is important to find what is inside. She shows him how she used to get in the greenhouse through a side panel. They enter and see fantastic plants beyond their normal size. A strange droning sound is heard. They find many flowers and plants of unusual size. Then another shriek is heard. Susan says the back room used to be a potters shed. Stephen insists that they find out what is in the darkened room. She is afraid what her father will do, but Stephen convinces her that this is what is affecting her whole family and they will not leave until they understand everything. She agrees to come with him.Inside the room they find a glowing substance which he says is radioactive. Another shriek causes Stephen to shine a light where he sees a number of grotesque creatures in cages. He remarks  it looks like a zoo in hell.Outside in the greenhouse, he explains that the creatures are mutations from being exposed to the radiation and that the large plants were also made large by exposure to radiation. As they look around, he takes a trowel and begins digging in the soil under a plant. He finds a dark glossy stone giving off heat. It is shown that all the plants have a stone buried with them, causing the growth. He wonders where the larger stone is that these were broken off from. He suggests the cellar. Susan remarks that her mother and Helga worked in the greenhouse.All at once a plant reaches out and envelopes Susan. She screams and Stephen comes to her rescue. She is surrounded by tendrils from the plant and Stephen finds a gardening tool to hack the plant away. He takes Susan to the door and kicks it open for them to escape.Back in the house, Stephen tells Susan to go upstairs while he searches the cellar. Meanwhile Witley is still calling to his wife through the door. Stephen opens a door to find a skeleton hanging from a wire. Upstairs, Susan finds her father asking what happened to her. She tells him they were in the greenhouse. He wants to know where Stephen is. He grabs her arm to twist it and she admits he is in the cellar. Witley takes off for the cellar.Fighting off bats, Stephen discovers the large cover containing the stone. The droning sound is heard. Witley approaches and demands that he leave. He tells Witley that the stone is destroying everyone and everything there. Suddenly a scream is heard from above. They race to see Susan.Stephen finds Susan on the floor and embraces her. Witley comes and asks if shes all right. Witley insists on finding Letitia and Stephen takes Susan away. They begin searching rooms as thunder and lightning are heard outside. One or more doors are blown open and flop about. Witley heads out calling his wife. The wind blows open a window and smashes a vase on a table as the curtains blow. They enter a large drawing room and close the windows. The wind blows the door shut and Stephen tells her its only the wind. They go to enter another room and a woman comes out, hideously deformed. They run downstairs with the hag following. They go into a large room and lock the door. The woman breaks through and attacks Stephen. He struggles with her and knocks her down. She gets back up and attacks him. He backs up against the glass doors and moves aside as she lunges. She falls through the doors. As Witley comes in and watches, the woman staggers forward and collapses. Her face is seen to melt, bleed and collapse. Witley tells Stephen to take Susan away.In the cemetery Witley tells Stephen that the evil of Corbin attacked his family. He tells of when the stone fell from heaven and glowed. Everyone came to see it but stayed away from the glowing. Stephen says it was a meteor and had nothing to do with Corbin or a curse. Witley says he took it into the house and cut it into smaller stones in the hopes of beautifying the countryside and raising great crops of food and flowers. He was hoping to restore honor to the name of Witley. Susan comes up and urges him to come back to the house. He tells them to go away. Susan insists she wont leave her father. Stephen tells her that nothing else can be done. She appeals to her father but he commands her to go away with Stephen.As they go to pack, Witley gets an axe and opens the lid to the stone. Inside the glowing and humming is heard. He hacks it with the ax and breaks it. Helga comes in with a knife to attack him. He recognizes her and tries to defend himself with the ax. She grabs it and comes forward. She strikes the stone with the ax and more flashes occur.Upstairs, they hear Witley cry out. Stephen tells her to stay there and he goes to investigate. The many satanic symbols and drawings on the walls are seen to glow. Witley lifts his head from over the stone and is seen to have a radioactive spot on his face. His face and hands show the radiation spreading rapidly. By the time Stephen arrives, there is no sign of Witley, except for the trail of glowing handprints on the walls. Stephen follows them and finally meets Witley, who is now glowing from his head and hands. He attacks and Stephen runs upstairs with Susan and they lock the door. Witley breaks through the door. Stephen tells Susan to wait over to the side until he tells her to run. Stephen hurls fireplace tools at Witley but he continues to attack. Stephen calls for Susan to run and she does. Witley begins to chase her. She hesitates by the top of the stairs and he breaks through the railing and falls to the floor below. There is an explosion and a fire breaks out. Susan almost falls below and Stephen lifts her back up. They go downstairs as the fire spreads to the house. The flames are so hot they have trouble getting out. Finally they find a door and flee the house.They look back at the burning house. She asks why did this have to happen? He says it didnt have to happen, but her father chose to use it to protect the Witley family instead of helping all people. He tells her to go. As the flames engulf the house, we see the image of Corbin, which seems to alter its expression."

There they ride an elevator (called a ""lift"" here) two miles down to the Central Operations complex: essentially a bunker where the real work of Project Inner Space takes place. There, Sorensen waits for the Council--but also is taking an X-ray treatment to a malignant growth (probably malignant melanoma, though this is never made clear) in his hand. His doctor, Bill Evans (Alfred Brown), knows that the treatments will not work, but, out of respect for the doctor-patient confidence that is basic to the Oath of Hippocrates, agrees to keep Sorensen's illness, and its severity, secret from everyone. That includes his wife, who is young enough to have been his daughter. (In fact, Maggie was once a student of his; that's how they met.)Sorensen cordially greets the Council and readily acknowledges a problem that Sir Charles challenged Maggie with on their way down: namely that Sorensen's drilling team has hit a solid wall that is all that separates them from the magma, and that in 17 weeks he hasn't advanced an inch. So now Sorensen wants to blast his way in with a thermonuclear missile (a gift from the United States). Sir Charles asks why the project's chief geologist, Ted Rampian (Kieron Moore), is not present. Rampian is a dissenting voice: he has warned that using a thermonuclear warhead as a demolition charge will deliver such a shock to the earth that the crust will crack. Sorensen gives a dismissive demonstration of Rampian's theory, and then delivers the majority opinion: that the detonation will release great heat and merely melt through to the magma.Sir Charles and the rest of the UNESCO Council are satisfied. But Ted Rampian returns, and is outraged to see the missile not only hanging in place, but now equipped with its warhead! Finding out that the UNESCO Council has already been and gone, without hearing from him, doesn't improve his mood. He angrily resigns from the Project and prepares to take all his notes and charts with him to London to lay his case before Sir Charles directly. Maggie begs him not to go, but she cannot stop him. (As a complication, Ted and Maggie were ""an item"" before she enrolled in Sorensen's class. Ted is still jealous, and they both know it. Perhaps even Steve knows it.)Rampian does get in to see Sir Charles and set forth his case in detail: years of nuclear testing (before the test ban treaty) have created ""fissures"" in the crust, several of them leading to a major tectonic fault. A thermonuclear detonation at that depth will crack them open, and if the crack extended along the fault, who knows where it might lead? Sir Charles frantically puts a call through to the Project. But they are too late. Sorensen orders the missile shot to proceed, desperate to achieve success before his funding gets cut and he dies before he can see his work done. The missile takes a dive, the warhead detonates, and magma shoots up to the surface, exactly as Sorensen said it would. Sorensen, generous in victory, asks Sir Charles to tell Rampian to get himself back to the Project and get back to work!Rampian returns to a Project in a triumphant mood. But then the earthquake reports start to trickle in. Rampian realizes that they are right along the fault, as he feared. Hastily he organizes a dive in the Indian Ocean, and there photographs what he was afraid to find: a chasm with magma boiling out of it, extending at three knots along the floor of the Indian Ocean. He brings his photographs back to Sorensen, who acknowledges the horrible truth: he has cracked the earth's crust, and might have started something that could destroy the world.The UNESCO Councillors are outraged, of course, but Sir Charles tells his colleagues, quite reasonably, to let Drs. Sorensen and Rampian work out a way to solve the problem. Rampian returns to the Project and assumes command. He and Sorensen then pore over spectrographic data and films of old nuclear detonations, and finally realize what has happened: the missile touched off a fusion explosion in a layer of hydrogen in a pocket beneath the magma, so that the force of the explosion was greater than Sorensen expected. But this finding also suggests a solution: another detonation in the path of the crack could break a gaping hole in the crust; the crack would run into it and stop. Rampian sets out with a heat-shielded fission bomb and asks a fellow scientist, Steele (Mike Steen), to descend into a dormant volcano crater with him to drop the bomb into the lava. Steele dies when the bomb, catching Steele's line between itself and the surrounding rock, parts the cable and sends Steele falling into the lava pit. Rampian, nearly overcome with grief, barely manages to release the bomb into the lava before he collapses at his line, overcome by the heat. The crew hastily haul him up and take him off the island, to a nearby island where they give the signal to set the bomb off. The bomb blows the volcano cone away, and at the Project site, the seismologists confidently believe that the crack has in fact stopped.Then Dr. Evans sends a message to Maggie informing her of the truth about her husband: that his disease is malignant, terminal, and will kill him within a week. She takes a tearful leave of Ted and prepares to rush back to Sorensen's side. But then another earthquake in the Indian Ocean signals that the crack has not stopped, but has changed direction. Rampian asks Sorensen to be more specific, and when he hears where the new quake's epicenter was, he realizes that the crack has doubled back toward the Project's original bore hole--a course that might not have the dire consequences of cleaving the crust into two equal hemispheres. But the crack is now moving at twice its original speed.Rampian rushes back to South Africa to observe the crack's progress personally. He and Maggie soon realize that two cracks have opened in the crust, both converging on the bore hole. Rampian orders an evacuation of a nearby village--but can then only watch helplessly as an evacuation train heads directly for the crack, and is wrecked when the crack knocks over a trestle while the train is trying to cross it. Frustrated, Rampian orders another evacuation, and then he and Maggie return to the Project. There they find that Sorensen has ordered a full evacuation--but Sorensen has stayed below in the bunker and won't come up!Maggie and Rampian take the elevator down, to find Sorensen sitting alone at the consoles. He says that he will personally record what he believes will be the birth of a new moon. Of course, he really is suicidal, a fact he makes clear when he sends Rampian and Maggie out of the control room on separate errands--and then abruptly shuts the heavy door, locking himself in, and then shorts out the motors that move the door. Heartsick, Rampian and Maggie race for the elevator to take it topside--but then a boulder smashes into the elevator cab, stopping it about halfway up. Desperately the two climb through the trap door and up the elevator shaft, and then climb uphill away from the bore hole as fast as they can.Finally the two cracks meet at the bore hole, and a gigantic disk of crust lifts up into space, to join the Moon in orbit. After which the earthquake activity stops, and small animals come out of hiding as Rampian and Maggie comfort one another, happy to be alive in a world that can still sustain them."

They soon change their minds and decide to eat the goo themselves and grow to gigantic proportions and decide to take over the town. They then kidnap the sheriff's daughter and later Nancy as insurance to make sure that they get what they want. It is now up to Genius and Mike to either come up with more goo to enable Mike and his friends to grow and take on Fred and his gang or to find an antidote to shrink Fred and his gang back down to size.—Brian Washington <Sargebri@att.net> On the outskirts of the small village of Hainesville, a landslide has closed off the community. As the storm rages, a car full of drunken teenagers has crashed into the landslide. Throwing open the doors, the music from the car radio blares out the doors as they dance and drink beer in the rain. After some time, one of them notices a broken sign telling that Hainesville is 3 miles away. One of them suggests to go there to have some fun.In town, teenage couple Mike (Tommy Kirk) and Nancy (Charla Doherty) are having an intimate moment when Nancy's little brother Genius (Ron Howard) interrupts them, showing a concoction that he has made with non-compatible chemicals. Strange enough, the mixture has not blown up. Nancy professes to not being impressed, and Genius returns to his basement laboratory, where he puts an electrical charge to the concoction, resulting in an explosion.Mike and Nancy quickly enter the lab, and find the concoction has turned pinkish, growing out of a tulip glass that Genius put it in. As they attempt to clean up the basement, a stray cat enters the lab and begins to eat some of the concoction. Mike shoos the cat away, but soon, the three find that the cat has grown enormous! Genius' dog named Wolf chases the cat out of the house, before Mike wonders what they have on their hands. Genius explains the concoction is probably ""Ammonia-actride-sulfate-deethyl-chlorazine,"" but opts to just call it ""goo.""Mike takes some, and the three go outside. Feeding it to a pair of white ducks, they watch as the ducks grow large, with Mike deciding that they can easily make a million dollars from Genius' invention. After going back inside, they find that Wolf has also eaten some of the goo, and grown large. The amusement soon turns to shock when Nancy looks out the window and sees the giant ducks are gone.Meanwhile, the delinquent teens have broken into the closed Hainesville theater. Having cleaned up, they head off to the local go-go dance club. No sooner have they arrived, than the giant ducks appear, amusing everyone as they dance to the music. Mike and Nancy are not far behind, and when Mike claims the ducks are his, one of the delinquent teens named Harry (Robert Random) demands to know how they got so big. Mike just hints that it's a food additive, and a 'million dollar secret.'Harry tells the other delinquents, who formulate a plan to try and find out more about the food additive. The leader of the delinquents named Fred (Beau Bridges) attempts to woo Nancy, while one of the girls named Jean (Tisha Sterling) attempts to get the information from Mike. However, neither Mike nor Nancy divulge the information Fred or Jean ask for.The next day, the giant ducks are killed and barbecued at a party in a nearby park. As Mike and Nancy serve up the giant ducks, Genius arrives, intent to show them that he's made more goo...only to watch as the substance dissolves into nothingness. One of the delinquent teen girls named Elsa (Gail Gilmore) notices this, and persuades Genius to take a walk with her, as she hopes he'll tell her where the rest of the goo is.Later on that evening, the delinquents sneak over to Nancy's house, and one of the teens named Pete (Tim Rooney) sneaks in and steals the substance, but not before a burglar alarm is tripped. Mike and his friends show up, and a brawl ensues, but the delinquents get away with the goo.Returning to the town theater, some of the teenagers want to use the goo and get rich, when a couple of the guys dare the others to take it. Several refuse to be considered cowards, and everyone takes the goo, causing the teenagers to grow 30 ft tall, and bursting out of their clothes. Some of the girls are ashamed of their size, but some of the guys see this as a way to get back at the adults.Fashioning clothing from curtains and cloth in the theater, the giants leave and appear at the local teen party, and proceed to dance. One of the girls named Merrie (Joy Harmon) picks up Mike friend Horsey (Johnny Crawford), and holds him to her chest as if he were dancing with her. Mike demands Fred tell Merrie to put his friend down, but when Fred refuses, Mike breaks a wooden chair on Fred's lower leg, causing the dancing to end.After brushing Mike aside Fred asserts that they are going to take over the town, but his plans fall short when the local Sheriff (Joe Turkel) arrives, and orders the giants to return to the theater where they've been staying.The Sheriff and Mike show up at the theater the next day, with the Sheriff demanding the giant teenagers leave Hainesville. However, Rick reveals that they have kidnapped the Sheriff's daughter, and use her as leverage against the Sheriff. The Sheriff then gives into the giants demands and surrenders all the guns in the town to them, as well as has food brought to them.Mike decides to do something about this, and feels that they need to capture one of the giants as their own hostage. Luring Fred into a neighborhood, Mike, Horsey and their friends attempt to capture Fred using their cars and some rope. However, the plan backfires when Pete captures Nancy, and Mike and the others are forced to let Fred go, as the two giants take her to the theater.Mike then comes up with a new scheme, with Horsey's girlfriend Red (Toni Basil) sent in to distract the male giants with a dance. After this, Mike appears outside the theater with a slingshot, meant as a distraction. Fred goes after Mike with a spear, and sends Merrie back into the theater to watch Nancy and the Sheriff's daughter. While she watches, Horsey shocks her with a large amount of ether-filled cotton, causing her to pass out. This allows Horsey and his friends to free Nancy and the Sheriff's daughter, and recover the guns.Meanwhile, Genius has failed to make more goo, but has come up with a yellow gaseous antidote that proves itself when Wolf shrinks back to normal size.Genius quickly takes the antidote and heads to the town square, where he uses it on the giants, shrinking them back down to normal size. Clutching onto their oversized garments, the now shrunken teens run out of town back to their car at the landslide. Realizing the car is damaged beyond repair, they realize they have a long walk ahead of them.Before they start, they are greeted by several little people who claim they are heading to Hainesville to find out about the goo. After the little people have passed them, the once giant teenagers walk off away from the small village and their car."

An eccentric artist is panned by a well-known critic at his opening for not having a good color sense, so he starts a new series, using his own blood to paint. Soon he is weakened and must find other sources of blood to continue his paintings.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> At the Farnsworth Galleries, Farnsworth looks at a painting is evidently admires and reluctantly picks the canvas up and takes it outside. He drops it to the ground, saturates it with gasoline and sets it afire. Blood pours out of the canvas as it burns.Artist Adam Sorge stands before a blank canvas, paints it a bit, and angrily throws it aside. He selects another canvas, and places it on the easel, but is upset because he cannot get the right color. Gigi, Adam's live-in girlfriend and model, enters the room and Adam accidentally hits her with his paintbrush. Gigi tells Adam that he is due at the Farnsworth Galleries in one hour and critics will be there. Adam arrives at his showing where an art critic, named Gregorovich, is talking with Farnsworth. Gregorovich tells that due to his less-than-impressive use of color, he is an ""artist impostor"". Adam argues with the critic and leaves, passing Mrs. Carter who admires Adam's past work that is on display.The next day, Farnsworth goes to Adam's house to pick up a new painting. He tells Adam that he feels the same way as Gregorovich about Adam's use of color. Farnsworth takes another painting and leaves, and Adam beats a painting, leaving the broken frame on the floor. Adam and Gigi then spend some intimate time in the bedroom and afterwards, Gigi bends over to pick up the destroyed painting and cuts her finger on a nail. Adam later sees the smeared blood on the canvas and checks it outside with the other paintings. Gigi comes into the room and apologies about the blood, when Adam picks up a rough sketch of a woman and places it on the easel. He asks Gigi to open the wound and he cuts her finger with a razor and ""paints"" by smearing her blood on the canvas. Gigi pulls her finger away and tells him to use his own blood. Adam cuts all of his fingers and paints with his blood until he is weak and collapses on the couch.After resting for a while, Adam looks at his painting. Gigi talks about how he phoned Farnsworth and told him that he had something big, and she wonders where he is going to get the blood to finish the painting. Suddenly, Adam stabs Gigi in the face and uses her bloody head as a brush to finish the painting. Adam buries Gigi's body in the sand hear his house and the next day, he takes the finished painting to the gallery to show everyone. Gregotovich declares it Adam's ""finest."" Mrs. Carter is there and agrees to Farnsworth's high price of $15,000 to purchase the painting. But Adam tells them that the painting is not for sale. Gregotovich challenges Adam to paint another masterpiece and Adam agrees.Meanwhile, Mrs. Carter is talking with her daughter April, who is going on a picnic with her boyfriend Rolf, and two other friends, Jack and Sydney. At Adam's house, he prepares to cut his fingers again to paint a new painting, when he sees April and her friends on the beach near his house. Adam goes out to spy on them and wait to jump on them so he can kill them and use their blood, but he gets diverted when he sees another couple, named Norman and Betsy, nearby kissing each other on a beach towel. Betsy wants to ride two water bikes that are in the water near Adam's house. As they are doing so, Adam approaches them in a motorboat where he attacks and stabs Norman in the chest with a spear killing him as Betsy screams. Adam subdues her and takes her away. Later, Adam is seen painting a new canvas with blood. He goes in to the next room where the dead Betsy is tied to a wall with her intestines and innards hanging out of her stomach. Adam squeezes more blood out of the disemboweled girl and finishes his painting. He takes it the following day to the gallery and again refuses to sell it. Adam storms out of the gallery, and Gregorovich notes that the painting is still wet and that Adam forgot to varnish it.A few weeks later, Adam is beside himself in his house, more or less a recluse. Mrs. Carter is at her home also wondering why she hasn't heard from Adam for this whole time. April then goes out with Rolf and their two friends again for another beach party. Adam watches them from a distance. When April ventures near Adam's house, Adam takes a canvas outside and pretends to be painting. Adam tells the curious April that he is looking for a model and he asks her to pose. After he tells April his name, she introduces herself and tells him that her mother is Mrs. Carter who wants to buys some of his paintings. Adam tells April that if she poses for him, she can have the painting for free. April returns to her friends near the beach and tells them about meeting Adam and she will be going back later in the evening.That evening, Adam lets April into his house where she notes blood-like paint in his picture, and after she makes a joke about putting blood into the work, Adam explodes at her and says that the joke is not funny to him. April wants to leave, but Adam convinces her to stay, and has her stand on a small stepladder. In order to keep her hands still, Adam ties up April's wrists and restrains her.Meanwhile, Jack and Sydney go looking for some firewood for a fire they make on the beach. Sydney finds Gigi's badly decomposed, half-buried corpse and screams for Jack. They show the body to Rolf who runs towards Adam's house with a flashlight. In the house, Adam tells April to turn away from him for a few seconds and he will be done... as he lifts up a large ax to kill her. Rolf runs inside where he acts rudely towards Adam. Seeing the ax Adam has, Rolf grabs a nearby shotgun and points it at Adam, keeping him at bay as he unties April. But Adam knocks the shotgun out of Rolf's hands with the ax and talks about how he ""immortalizes"" Gigi by keeping her alive in his painting and using peoples blood to ""immortalize"" them as well. When Jack and Sydney run into the house and momentarily distract Adam, Rolf grabs the shotgun. Adam lifts his ax to kill Rolf when he fires, hitting the deranged artist in the face. Adam stumbles and falls dead with his bloodied face on a blank canvas.The final scene picks up where the opening scene left off where Farnsworth is burning Adam's painting after it is made public about the insane artist using peoples blood for his paintings. Gregorovich arrives just as Farnsworth stands looking at the burning canvas where he tells the critic that he is burning Adam's ""funeral pyre""."

James Burke, after distinguishing himself as a midshipman in the British merchant marine, rapidly rises to the rank of executive officer, second in command of a ship. A broken foot necessitates that he be put ashore to heal. After his recovery, the very proud Jim - his pride rooted in his competence, which had made him a highly respected and admired naval officer - signs on as the executive officer of the Patna, a rusty tub manned by a third-rate crew overseen by a barbarous captain, that is transporting a group of Moslem pilgrims to Mecca. During a severe storm that causes the unseaworthy ship to founder, Jim abandons ship with the rest of the white crew without even lowering the other lifeboat for the passengers. The fleeing crew are prepared to swear they saw the Patna sink with all its passengers; however, in what Jim believes is a cosmic joke upon himself, it is revealed when they get into port on their lifeboat that the Patma did not sink but had been salvaged by a French vessel. In the ensuing inquiry that he himself sought to do penance for his sins (the ultimate sin for a naval officer being to abandon ship particularly when passengers or crew are still on-board), Jim is admonished after confessing his cowardice, chastised for bringing shame upon those to whom he belongs, the British merchant marine. His chief judge asks him why he did not ""bury himself 20 feet deep"" rather than seek the inquiry and humiliate himself and all professional British sailors. Jim does succeed in ""burying himself 20 feet deep"" by becoming a drifter and common laborer in various southeast Asian ports, though he never can completely escape into anonymity. The burden of his sin follows him everywhere. Racked by guilt over abandoning his ship, the proud Jim seeks atonement, a second chance, which comes in the guise of running arms and gunpowder to a tribe of indigenous peoples oppressed by a ruthless and brutal warlord. The warlord knows that the difference between a hero and a coward is not as thick as a piece of paper. What will this mean for Jim, now committed to a heroic path for a people whom he does not even know? The man the natives soon call ""Lord Jim"" is about to face his destiny, which is relentless and inescapable.—Jon C. Hopwood"

Fascist Slovakia during WW2. Tono lives a poor life, but the authorities offer him to take over the Jewish widow Lautman's little shop for sewing material. She is old and confused and thinks that he is only looking for employment and hires him. The odd couple begin to like each other. But some time later the authorities decide that the Jews must leave the city. What should he do with the old lady?—Mattias Thuresson In 1942, in a small town in then fascist Slovakia, the poor carpenter Tony Brtko is assigned ""Aryanizator"" of a small shop on the main street by his fascist brother-in-law Mark Kolkotsky. His greedy wife Evelyn is seduced with the promise of fortune, but Tony finds that the store owned by the deaf and senile seventy eight year-old widow Rozalie Lautmann is bankrupted and the old lady is financially supported by the Jewish community that promises a salary to him to help her. Tony befriends Ms, Lautmann and helps her in the store and repairs her furniture, and lures his wife with his salary. When the Jews are expelled from the town by the fascist, Tony decides to help the old lady.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil An inept Slovak peasant is torn between greed and guilt when the Nazi-backed bosses of his town appoint him ""Aryan controller"" of an old Jewish widow's button shop. Humor and tragedy fuse in this scathing exploration of one cowardly man's complicity in the horrors of a totalitarian regime.—The Criterion Collection It's early 1942 in a fascist Slovak state. Milquetoast Tono, a poor carpenter, has missed out on professional opportunities by not joining the Fascist Guard, one such opportunity to work on the Tower of Babel monument being built in the center of town to commemorate the Nazi victory. Despite not liking his brother-in-law Mark - his wife Evelyn's sister Rosie's husband - who does flaunt his wealth amassed through connections within the Fascist Guard, Tono is provided an opportunity by Mark who has arranged for him to be the Aryan controller of a shop on Main Street, a store selling sewing notions, primarily buttons, owned and operated by seventy-eight year-old Rozalia Lautmannová. Evelyn believes they can get rich primarily by pillaging Mrs. Lautmannová's possessions, she assuming in Mrs. Lautmannová being Jewish that there are hidden gold pieces. Tono discovers that Mrs. Lautmannová is not only hard of hearing but has little idea of the new world order and, as such, believes Tono has come to help her as her assistant at the store rather than take it over for his own benefit. He further learns that the store makes no money, but that the organized Jewish community, who looks after their own in need, will pay him handsomely to be Mrs. Lautmannová's protector. In the process, a friendship develops between Tono and Mrs. Lautmannová. Tono has to hide this arrangement from Evelyn, Rosie, Mark, and the Fascist Guard, who would see what he is doing as worse than being Jewish himself. Tono has to decide what to do when he learns through the grapevine that Nazis will soon be corralling and sending the Jewish away to ""labor camps"", and if there is an option to protect both himself and Mrs. Lautmannová who has no idea at all what is going on.—Huggo"

Now discharged from prison, he changes his mind about returning home to his mother and decides to go elsewhere and start afresh - a decision that will alter his life and way of thinking forever.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) The movie starts with Raju (Dev Anand) being released from jail. Raju was a freelance guide, who earned his living by taking tourists to historic sites. One day, a wealthy and aging archaeologist, Marco (Kishore Sahu) comes to the city with his young wife Rosie (Waheeda Rehman), the daughter of a courtesan. Marco wants to do some research on the caves outside the city and hires Raju as his guide.While Marco devotes himself to the discovery of the cave, Raju takes Rosie on a tour and appreciates her dancing ability and innocence. He learns about Rosie's background as a daughter of a virgin courtesan and how Rosie has achieved respectability as the wife of Marco but at a terrible cost. She had to give up her passion of dancing since it was unacceptable to Marco. Meanwhile, Rosie tries to commit suicide by consuming poison. Marco, upon learning of the incident, returns from the caves to see Rosie and is furious with Rosie after seeing her alive. He tells her that her act of committing suicide was a drama, otherwise she would have consumed more sleeping pills so that she could really have died. Upon returning to the caves which were discovered, Rosie learns that Marco is spending time and enjoying the company of a native tribal girl. She is enraged at Marco and both indulge in a serious heated discussion, which concludes with Rosie leaving the caves, and she once again wants to end her life.Raju calms her down by saying that committing suicide is a sin, and that she should live to pursue her dream. She finally says good-bye to the relation of being the wife of Marco. Now she needs support and a home. Raju gives her shelter. Rosie is considered a prostitute by Raju's community (as classical dancing traditionally was prostitutes' work at royal courts), which leads to many problems, including his mother and her brother insisting that Rosie be kicked out. Raju refuses and his mother leaves him. His friend and driver also falls out with him over Rosie. Raju loses his business and the entire town turns against him. Undeterred by these setbacks, Raju helps Rosie embark on a singing and dancing career and Rosie becomes a star. As she rises as a star, Raju becomes dissolute - gambling and drinking. Marco comes back on the scene. Trying to win Rosie back, he brings flowers and has his agent ask Rosie to release some jewelry which is in a safe deposit box. Raju, a bit jealous, does not want Marco to have any contact with Rosie and forges Rosie's name on the release of the jewels. Meanwhile, Rosie and Raju drift apart due to Rosie's incomprehensible behavior when she tortures Raju by not obliging him a caring hug even and asks him to leave her room else she says she will have to go out. Before this, they also had a discussion about how a man should live when Rosie remembers Marco and tells Raju that Marco was probably correct when he used to say that a man should not live on a woman's earnings.Raju retorts by saying that she is under a misunderstanding that she has become a star on her own and it was only because of Raju's efforts that she became famous. Later, Rosie learns of the forgery release. Raju is convicted of forgery, resulting in a two-year sentence. Rosie does not understand why Raju indulged in forgery, when he could have easily asked her for money. It was not money, it was the loving fascination for Rosie which urged Raju not to reveal Marco's visit to Rosie so that she doesn't remember him again and to eliminate the probability of Rosie and Marco's togetherness, if at all, there was any little chance. On the day of his release, his mother and Rosie come to pick him up but they are told that he was released six months ago because of his good behavior.Meanwhile, upon his release Raju wanders alone.

Curse of the Fly,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059076/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Motorist Martin Delambre attempts to keep evidence of his family's bizarre experiments in teleportation hidden from his wife, who is hiding secrets of her own. Remember that scientist that was trying to perfect a matter transportation machine but got fused with a fly when one of the little critters got into the transporter with him? Well, this story is about three of his descendants (a son, Henri Delambre, played byBrian Donlevyand two grandsons). Seems the son wants to continue and perfect the machine while his two sons want to get out of the scientist business and live ""normal"" lives. The oldest son, Martin, decides to take a wife (who just happens to have escaped from a mental hospital after her parents died). Martin's father is not happy with this intrusion but finally gives in because he understands him son's needs. They all try to be a happy family until humans used in botched experiments are discovered by the new bride and the police nearly discover the lab while looking for Martin's wife. Everyone tries to get out of there via the transporter but things just don't go according to plan .—Jane Byron Dean <jane_dean@corp.disney.com> The movie opens at night on the façade of an old building. A window shatters, the shards coming straight at the camera. A woman wearing only bra and panties exits the room through the window. Title and credits follow. The woman makes her way to the front gate of the property. She runs down the street away from the Fournier Mental Hospital. Driving down the road is Martin Delambre (George Baker). He sees the woman run off the road and into the woods so he stops to render assistance. He tosses his sweater to the scantily clad young woman. Patricia Stanley (Carole Gray) inquires as to his direction. When he tells her Montreal, she responds, ""Oh, that's where I wanted to go."" Pat makes up a story about having to leave in a hurry, away from the unwanted attention of the husband of the woman writer she used to work for. Martin stops at a house and steals some clothes for Pat. Martin agrees to put her up at a hotel until she gets on her feet. He then lends her some money until she gets a job and can repay him. Martin calls his home and the houseboy, Tai (Burt Kwouk) answers the phone. Martin reports that the new equipment will be ready in a week and to tell his father. The maid, Wan (Yvette Rees) approaches Tai to learn what is going on. Tai enters the lab and calls London on a short-wave radio set. In a similarly equipped lab in London, Henri Delambre (Brian Donlevy) is sleeping on a cot and calls to his son, Albert. Albert Delambre (Michael Graham) answers the call. Tai inquires on the health of Henri Delambre, and the senior Delambre responds he is fine. Albert is annoyed that his father lied, ""Why don't you tell Martin the truth?"" Father replies, ""I don't want to worry him. We're so close to success."" Albert is concerned and threatens, ""If you won't tell him, I will. I won't have anything more to do with the experiment."" Albert wants a life of his own, but his father appeals to family history and the promise of a breakthrough. ""The teleporter will replace every known means of transportation."" Albert reminds his father about the failures: Judith, Samuels and Dill, but Father reminds his son, ""Last week, you and Martin teleported me from Quebec to London."" Albert reinforces his concern by lifting his father's shirt and exposing a huge radioactive burn on his back, ""Do you call that success?""Martin and Pat are having dinner. A romance is blossoming between the two, but both are hiding secrets about themselves. A week has flown by and Martin is due to return home. They are on a picnic in the country and Martin impulsively proposes marriage. At a Montreal police station, Madame Fournier (Rachel Kempson) reports the escape of Patricia Stanley to Inspector Ronet (Jeremy Wilkins). Ronet demands to know why she waited so long to report the escape. Fournier explains that they are a private mental institution and that Patricia is not a lunatic, but only suffered a nervous breakdown. Before her concert debut her mother died and she suffered a breakdown. Pat and Martin are preparing to leave the picnic area when he suffers an attack of some type. She drives back to the hotel. She is unable to get a response at his door. Martin has administered an injection, but we see that his condition is serious. The skin on his face is puffy and blotched. He is having trouble breathing. Pat is so concerned she calls for the hotel Porter (Arnold Bell) to open his door. A cash gratuity overcomes his concern about hotel rules, but he knocks on the door rather than use his pass key. Martin, looking normally, answers the door.Martin and Pat, now married, pull up to the Delambre house in his Chevrolet station wagon. Tai answers the door and is introduced to Martin's new wife. He registers only mild surprise, then welcomes the new mistress of the house. Ronet checks with the hotel manager (Warren Stanhope) on Patricia Stanley, but gets very little information, except the connection to Martin Delambre. Martin gets Pat settled in their room. He goes to the lab. Wan delivers the suitcases to the bedroom, then quickly departs. Martin calls his brother, Albert, in London. His father interrupts to ask about the equipment. Delambre explains that his passport is not in order and he must return to Canada as soon as Martin can assemble the new equipment. While Pat waits patiently in the bedroom, Martin and Tai assemble the machinery. The lights dim in the bedroom as the teleportation equipment in the lab is brought to full power. The senior Delambre is dressed in a suit. He dons a set of protective goggles for his eyes. Albert closes the glass panels in the casket-like transport chamber. Martin and Tai prepare to receive Delambre. They hold welder's masks. Albert transports his father. The transporter lights the room. Albert reports the disintegration complete. A similar bright flash of light and the senior Delambre appears in the chamber. Martin administers oxygen to his father. It is while checking his father's heart he notices the body bandage. Martin was unaware of the mishap after the last transmission. Delambre explains to Martin that without the new equipment there were radiation burns. Delambre asks his son about the woman's voice he heard on the phone. Martin admits he met a girl in Montreal and married her. Martin tells his father he wants a life of his own, exactly the same words Albert used.Ronet returns to his office and informs Madame Fournier he has made an appointment to see ex-inspector Charas to discuss the Delambre family. She does not understand the connection, but Ronet tells her she will understand after Charas explains. The next afternoon Martin tells Pat that his father has arrived from London. Delambre meets his new daughter-in-law and is very friendly. Pat is surprised when she sees the piano in the conservatory room. Tai informs Martin there are people at the gate. Pat helps herself to the piano while Delambre registers unease. She plays with ease as her father-in-law looks on. Wan enters with a tray with an equally uncomfortable look on her face. Wan hurries outside, past three locked doors to the fourth. She looks through the top observation panel and tells the occupant, ""Be quiet now. Be quiet, Judith."" Wan takes the lunch dish and an arm extends from the bottom trap door and takes her hand. A second hand extends, this one is wrinkled and claw-like. It entwines Wan's wrist and applies a vice-like grip causing Wan to grimace in pain, ""You're hurting me. Let go, Judith. You scratched my hand."" Martin walks to the gate. Ronet explains that Madame Fournier operates the asylum from which Miss Stanley escaped. Ronet explains that they intend to take her back. Martin explains that, ""Miss Stanley and I were married yesterday."" After a brief exchange, Martin reluctantly lets them enter the house. Tai enters the room holding the marriage certificate. Fournier and Ronet examine the document and stipulate it is genuine. Fournier tries to instill fear with her pronouncement about Pat's mental illness, but Delambre only replies, ""She appears to have made a remarkable recovery since leaving your hands."" Tai shows Ronet and Fournier out. Pat runs to the back of the house where the doors are located. She is drawn to a scratching at one of them. She opens the observation panel on the door next to Judith's door. She opens the bolt on the trap door on the bottom of the door, but it slams shut. She peers inside the door at the top and is frightened by the distorted face that looks back at her. Pat screams and runs to the house. She runs straight into Wan who just stares at her. Martin comes along and comforts his wife. Martin explains they are research animals.Martin, his father, and Pat have lunch. After Pat leaves, Martin has another attack. His father helps him to a couch and then prepares an injection. He asks his son, ""When did this start again?"" Delambre tells his son they must proceed and quickly. Albert has become unreliable and Martin's marriage and the authorities snooping about have made him uncomfortable. A nurse (Mia Anderson) wakes Inspector Charas (Charles Carson) and tells him he has a telephone call. The old man is in a hospital bed and is wearing dark glasses. He is told by Ronet that he won't be visiting after all. When informed that Martin and Patricia Stanley are married, Charas replies, ""Martin Delambre's married already, has been for years...Her name is Judith.""A woman sits at the piano, playing with one hand. Judith (Mary Manson) struggles to play. Pat wakes in her room and hears the piano being played downstairs. She walks down to investigate. Judith becomes frustrated when her deformed left hand approaches the keys. Pat enters the room, turns on the lights, and is shocked to see the woman at the piano. Half of her face is a mass of tissue; it runs from forehead to chin covering her left eye. Judith covers her face with her deformed hand. Wan allows Pat to fall to the floor and tells the deformed woman, ""Come Judith. It's time to go now."" Judith limps across the room and accompanies Wan back to her cell outside. Pat wakes in bed when her husband returns. He tries to convince her it was a bad dream. Wan lies and denies seeing Pat in the conservatory or anyone playing the piano. While Martin comforts his wife, Delambre scolds Wan down in the lab. He tells her, ""You will not let Judith out again, except by Mr. Martin's order or mine. Is that understood?"" Martin comes into the lab and gets another injection by his father. ""We've got to teleport Samuels and Dill to London immediately,"" he tells his son. Albert's job will be to dispose of the two test subjects. Martin asks about Judith, but his father reminds his son that since he remarried he must make that decision. The two men drug and return Samuels and Dill to the lab for transport, but one escapes.Charas does meet with Ronet. He explains the family history to the policeman. Ronet asks if there were any ill effects from the process, ""No effect? No deformities?"" ""None that you can see,"" is the reply from Charas. Charas explains that Martin and his father are affected by the cold and also, at times, by a premature and very rapid aging. They have to have regular injections of a special serum. The other brother, Albert, is quite normal. The large deformed man attacks Martin in the lab. Delambre grabs a golf club and beats him almost to death. Martin calls his brother in London, but gets no answer. As father and son transport one body, Wan places a picture of Judith on Pat's nightstand. In her drugged state Pat reaches for it, but knocks the picture to the floor breaking the glass. In the lab, another body is transported and Martin again calls Albert in London. Delambre tells Albert he wants him to reintegrate immediately and dispose of the package. Albert reintegrates the combined subjects and is horrified by the writing mass of tissue in the chamber. He runs from the lab and returns with an axe.Delambre talks to Ronet on the telephone. He agrees to come to Montreal and discuss the situation. Martin sees his wife and tells her they have to go to the city. Martin confirms that Pat did see Judith and reluctantly admits to Pat that their experimental animals are actually humans and that Judith was one of the subjects. Ronet asks about Judith and is told they got a Mexican divorce. Ronet also asks about Samuels and Dill and is told they were exchange student lab assistants, and they left at the end of their terms. Ronet calls for a search warrant after the Delambres leave the office. At home, Judith finds bits of the broken glass from the picture frame. This confirms in her mind that she was not dreaming or hallucinating. Wan releases Judith from her cell and is attacked by Judith. Judith locks Wan inside the cell and goes to find Pat. Pat confronts Judith at the front door and then runs to the lab. Judith slowly follows, dragging her bandaged foot and leg. Tai opens the door for Pat just as Judith reaches her. Tai and Judith struggle in the lab, Tai knocks her out with a wrench. Tai releases Wan from the cell and they decide to leave. Tai tells Wan that he killed Judith. The two decide to use the teleporter to dispose of Judith's dead body first. As Martin carries Pat back to the house he sees the house lights dim, a sure sign the equipment is being powered up. Once inside the lab, Tai explains to all that Judith got away. Delambre dismisses the staff and tells Martin that Pat must be teleported to London. As Martin disposes of all their notes in the fire, Delambre implores Albert to help. But Albert refuses, ""You murdered those men, and you made me a murderer too."" Martin gets on the phone to talk to his brother. He pleads for his father. Martin tells his brother that he is sending his father through. Albert pleads, but Martin hangs up. Martin teleports his father, but he doesn't realize Albert has destroyed the London equipment, an axe still in the body of the Samuels/Dill reintegrated tissue in the reintegrater chamber.
Tai and Wan depart the house just as Ronet arrives. Martin has placed Pat in the transporter. She wears the eye protecting goggles. Martin tries again and again to raise Albert on the radio. He collapses, but does manage to help Pat out of the teleporter. He again collapses but gets up and drags Pat outside. Ronet enters the lab, looks around, and returns to the conservatory. Martin collapses into the car, pleading for his wife's help. Inside the car, we see he has aged at least 50 years. Ronet gets on the phone and calls for reinforcements and puts out an APB on Tai and Wan. Pat runs into the conservatory to use the phone. Ronet confronts her. She directs the policeman outside to Martin. Ronet looks into the car and sees what is left of Martin: a skull and empty clothes. He returns to Pat and we close with Ronet escorting Pat inside the house, the cast credits, and the question, ""Is this the end?"""

His men mutiny, lock up Chavez, seize the Dutch boat, and capture its captain (Gert Fröbe).A Royal Navy cutter appears and the pirates re-board their own ship in panic. Emily is awakened by the bound Dutch captain, who storms frantically into her room holding a knife and, speaking only Dutch, is imploring her to cut his bindings. Terrified, and dazed by the sleeping draughts she has been given by Chavez to soothe her pain, she mistakes his intentions, and stabs him to death. The shocked Chavez intervenes too late and is left with blood on his hands. He and his former crew are taken prisoner and shipped to Britain for trial. Under questioning in court, the barrister twists Emily's words to imply she blames Chavez for killing the Dutch captain. The pirates are sentenced to hanging for this death, instead of merely being imprisoned for piracy.In the final scene children play innocently by a lake. Emily stands amongst them-staring at a model ship with adult eyes."
The Knack... and How to Get It,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059362/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young school teacher tries to master the art of flirtation using his neighbor's skills. Cool, sophisticated Tolen (Ray Brooks) has a monopoly on womanizing--with a long line of conquests to prove it--while naïve, awkward Colin (Michael Crawford) desperately wants a piece of it. But when Colin falls for an innocent country girl (Rita Tushingham), it's not long before the self-assured Tolen moves in for the kill. Is all fair in love and war, or can Colin get the The Knack and beat Tolen at his own game?—Noel Kardaris London schoolteacher Colin is self-conscious about his general inexperience with the opposite sex, unlike his roommate Tolen, who has a proverbial revolving door of beautiful young women in and out of his bedroom, and who cannot help Colin just by teaching him his approach with women. While Tolen wants to rent their third bedroom to his equally-womanizing friend Rory McBryde, the two who would be able to share their female conquests with Colin, someone unknown to them swoops in to rent the room: Tom, who seems more concerned about getting rid of its drab brownness--including Colin's furniture in the furnished room--to a more pristine white. Evolving in thought, Colin ultimately comes to the belief that his lack of success with women is due to the small size of his bed, and he wants a six-foot bed like Rory's. On their way back from the junkyard where Tom knew of such a bed with a wrought-iron frame, Colin and Tom literally pick up Nancy Jones, who has just arrived in town and was looking for the YWCA. Naive Nancy has a quick learning curve in her dealings in London with this collective: Tolen sees her as another conquest, while Colin thinks she can get him out of his rut. As this foursome wanders around London individually, in small groups, or as four, those they encounter act as a Greek chorus commenting on their goings-on.—Huggo"

Encountering the woman, they shoot at her, but she just keeps right on going.In a small cafeteria, she drinks a glass of milk, and the liquid pours from the bullet holes in her body and trenchcoat!It is in the cafeteria, that she encounters a young man named Craig Gamble (Frankie Avalon). However, she claims he is named Todd Armstrong. Craig tries to deny this, but she insists on going back to his place, which just so happens to be a small one-bedroom apartment.Meanwhile, we suddenly find ourslves inside the lair of Dr Goldfoot (Vincent Price), and his assistant Egor (Jack Mullaney). Goldfoot is incensed that his bikini girl that Craig is with (who has said to him her name is 'Diane'), has hooked up with the wrong Todd Armstrong! Goldfoot then orders his girl (known as Number 11), to get out of there.As Craig watches, Number 11's vocal pitch changes, and she storms out of his room, leaving him wanting her even more.Diane then goes back to the street, and encounters the real Todd Armstrong, a very rich bachelor. She manages to charm him, and they take off for his place.Meanwhile, Craig has been obsessed with finding Diane, and calls the directory assistance, but gets nowhere (since all he has is Diane's first name, there's no way to find her). Soon after, Craig is angrily called into the office of his Uncle, Donald. Both of the relations work for Secret Intelligence Command (SIC), and Donald is upset at Craig's obsession with Diane, as well as the fact that he is known as 'Double-O-and-a-half.' Uncle Donald then demands that Craig work on helping SIC, and raise his title to at least a digit, instead of a fraction.Meanwhile, Number 11 has conned Todd Armstrong into marrying her, and their wedding makes a magazine cover, where Craig sees her, and is heart-broken.Back at his secret lair, Dr Goldfoot begins sending out more of his girls, each one programmed to do as Number 11 has done: snare a rich husband, get him to sign over his fortune to them, and then Dr Goldfoot will collect once the girls are through.In the wake of his marriage to Number 11, Todd has given her a large diamond ring, but is upset when she sleeps in a separate bed then him, and with a screen dividing them on their honeymoon. Diane claims it's because her batteries were low, and Todd just dismisses this as ridiculous. She then asks for Todd to give her a wedding present, requesting he sign over several of his stocks and holdings to her.Diane then takes the signed forms, and leaves Todd, telling him to go to work.Out of the street, Craig sees Diane, and attempts to talk to her, but she claims she has no idea who he is. As he attempts to take her off the street, Dr Goldfoot appears, and tugs Diane into a car, leaving Craig sprawled on the sidewalk, with Diane's left hand left behind!In his car, Goldfoot is at first pleased with Diane's work, until he finds that even though they have Armstrong's holdings, he did not sign over his power of attorney to her!

Remembering the name of the mortuary on the side of Goldfoot's car, Craig heads out there, where he sees his assistant Igor disappearing into a coffin. Craig follows him, and finds the Dr's secret lair, along with his bikini machine, and seeing Diane being tortured. Igor quickly discovers Craig, but not before he manages to escape.Returning to his Uncle's office, Craig attempts to tell what he's seen, but his Uncle claims he's busy, with one of SIC's head officers. However, Craig recognizes Igor in disguise, but both his Uncle and Igor claim he's nuts.Realizing that noone will believe him, Craig then goes to Diane's fiance, Todd. Todd naturally doesn't believe Craig's claims that Diane is a robot, until Craig shows him Diane's severed hand (complete with wedding band!).The two then decide to team up, pretty sure that Diane will return to get Todd to sign over Power of Attorney to her. Craig hides in a secret room, as Todd waits for Diane. Eventually, she does appear, making the chain-lock open automatically, before requesting he come with her to the bedroom. As she makes a request for his signature for Power of Attorney, Todd attempts to yell for Craig, but Diane quickly kisses him, and convinces him to sign. No sooner has he finished signing the form, then she quickly changes into a new outfit, and literally 'disappears' through the front door, the effect of which causes Todd to faint. Craig is also incapacitated, as he has delved into Todd's secret bar hidden behind the wall.Once the two come to, Craig feels bad that he didn't hear Todd's cry, but Todd claims they still pulled one over on Dr Goldfoot: he signed a name on the Power of Attorney line, but Craig's, so that Diane still has no way to get the money for Goldfoot.Once again, Craig attempts to convince his Uncle Donald that something is going on, even bringing Todd to back up his claims, but as the previous times, there is no convincing his Uncle.Craig and Todd then head to Dr Goldfoot's mortuary, where they are soon caught by the doctor and his assistant. Goldfoot shows the two his bikini machine, and then has them sit down for dinner, with Diane in attendance (albeit only able to speak and understand Japanese now!).After their dinner, Goldfoot then attempts to get Todd to sign the forms giving him 'Power of Attorney,' but Todd still refuses, having Goldfoot place him underneath a large, lowering pendulum. Luckily, Craig manages to trick Igor into letting him go. He rescues Todd, and the two take off in the Dr's Cadillac, with Goldfoot and Igor in hot pursuit in a motorcycle and sidecar.The chase leads them all over San Francisco, before both the Doctor and Igor drive off a cliff near some Naval Practice grounds, where they and their vehicle are destroyed.In the aftermath, Todd feels that he and Craig need a vacation, and the two decide to jet off to Paris.

Return from the Ashes,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059649/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In Paris, a Polish gigolo marries a rich Jewish doctor and stands to inherit her estate when she is deported to Dachau by the Nazis. Stanislaus Pilgrin, a Polish chess master and handsome gigolo, marries wealthy Jewish widow Dr. Michele Wolf, an X-ray technician, has an affair with her stepdaughter Fabienne, then plots to murder them both in a scheme in which he will inherit their money.—alfiehitchie In the winter of 1945, on a train bound for Paris, a small boy kicks monotonously at the outside compartment door of a crowded compartment--and then opens the door and jumps from the train. His mother howls in anguish, an unnamed passenger pulls the brake cord, the conductor comes and escorts the distraught mother to an empty compartment in the next car--and everyone else in the compartment wonders why one fellow passenger, a woman, sat mute and motionless throughout the entire shocking episode. And then someone notices the concentration-camp tattoo on her right forearm. The fact of the matter is that Dr. Michele Wolf (Ingrid Thulin) has seen--and experienced--such horrors that a little thing like a little boy jumping off a moving train to his death looks like the spilling of milk in comparison. And not a man or woman on board could possibly dispute that--especially not a Gentile.Michele arrives in Paris, books a room under an assumed name, and then calls the number of her old home. Her husband, Stanislaus Pilgrin (Maximillian Schell) picks up the phone and says hello, but Michele does not answer. And on the other end of the wire, Stan's companion, Fabienne Wolf (Samantha Eggar), Michele's stepdaughter from a previous marriage, urges Stan to hang up.Michele goes up to her room and recalls the years that brought her to this pass. She met Stan before the outbreak of war in Europe. He was much younger than she (thus making her what is today called a ""cougar"") and made his living, such as it was, as a professional chess player. Michele, as she would later admit, ""bought"" him--and Stan always resented having to take money from Michele, just as he resented having to live from prize to prize off his playing.Dr. Charles Bovard (Herbert Lom), a plastic surgeon at the hospital where Michele is on staff as a radiation oncologist, disapproved of the match, recognizing exactly the sort of man Stan was and is: a gigolo. He soon had reason to worry about far more momentous things: the Nazis overran the Maginot Line and occupied Paris. Soon they subjected all the hospitals to new employment regulations, which affected Michele directly, because she is Jewish. Stan offered to marry Michele in order to give her an identity apart from being a Jewess--but on the day of her wedding, a Nazi patrol arrested Michele and took her away.Now in 1945, Michele introduces herself first, not to Stan, but to Charles Bovard. She confesses to him some of the horrors she endured--including prostituting herself to the camp guards in exchange for rations in excess of starvation rations. Charles can and does understand her having to do what she needs to do in order to survive--but he is not sure about her plan to re-enter Stan's life. Nevertheless, he performs a reconstructive procedure to make Michele look as near to her old (pre-Holocaust) self as the consummately skilled Charles can manage--and then Michele allows Fabienne to see her at the hotel, this although Fabienne fails to recognize Michele for who she is.The reason for this failure is simple: Michele was reported dead in the camps. But she was never so declared--because under French law, dating back to the Code Napoleon, no one is declared dead until a coroner has a body to examine. This actually creates a problem for Fabienne and Stan: Michele is, quite simply, the surviving heiress of a large portion of the private wealth once owned by thousands of Jews who died in the camps--300 million francs' worth. If Michele could be declared dead, Fabienne would then inherit--but the law is clear: no body, no claim.So when Fabienne tells Stan of meeting a woman who looks remarkably like Michele at her hotel (recall that this is Michele, registered under an alias), and Stan meets Michele in her hotel and does not recognize her, he makes a shocking proposal to her: that she pose as Michele long enough to establish an identity, then feign her death so that the 300-million-franc legacy would be released. In return she would collect a ""finder's fee"" of 30 percent.Charles is shocked as Michele decides to play along long enough to see whether Stan will actually recognize that she really is Michele. Eventually Michele does reveal herself to Stan, who is only half willing to have her back, and to Fabienne, who, quite simply, hates her guts for coming between her and Stan. Michele, of course, establishes her claim to the massive Jewish legacy, but the tensions in the household rise to a breaking point, and Fabienne prepares to leave.But on her last day, Fabienne challenges Stan to undertake a plot to murder Michele by tricking her into opening a wall safe rigged with a gun. At first Stan refuses--but that night, Fabienne takes her last bath, and also takes champagne and barbiturates, a potentially fatal combination. Stan pumps Fabienne for a few more details on how to make the plot work--and then drowns Fabienne and then rigs the bathroom door to make it appear that Fabienne locked herself in and deliberately took an overdose.Michele, as Stan expects, takes the news badly and blames herself for Fabienne's death. Stan loudly tells the police investigators how worried he now is for her mental health.A few months later, Stan leaves town, telling Michele that he is going to Brussels to play in a chess tournament. Where he really goes is to a Paris suburb, which is part of Fabienne's plan. But there is another complication of which Stan is unaware: Charles comes to see Michele on the night of the tournament and quarrels with Michele over her continued enabling of Stan. Michele orders him out--and at that moment, Stan, who has made enough of a scene at the Paris suburb where he has gone that multiple witnesses would swear that he was in that city, has gotten enough of a moment alone to call Michele and trick her into opening the rigged safe.Michele agrees to open the safe to retrieve what she thinks will be a small present Stan bought, in anticipation of his victory. Stan waits a long time, then in an attack of cold feet, calls out to Michele four times. Then he hears a single gunshot, and hangs up.He then comes back home and finds Michele lying on the floor of the library, apparently dead. He completes the last part of the plan: disconnecting the gun, wiping it of fingerprints, placing it in Michele's hand, and dropping it on the floor--a classic ""throwdown."" Then he calls the police--but when he turns back to the library, he notices that Michele is no longer lying on the floor. Returning to the library, he is suddenly surrounded by two detectives, Charles Bovard--and a very much alive Michele.What has actually happened is this: Michele quarreled with Charles--but when she told Charles to leave, Charles opened the outer door of the foyer--and then closed it again. He intended to go back into the house and apologize, but before he could reopen the inner door, the telephone rang. Charles waited a decent interval, and then walked in on Michele, who asked him to wait, because she was still on the telephone. She moved to the library, and Charles waited just outside--until Stan shouted Michele's name four times. Charles stepped in, Michele turned toward Charles--and Charles saw the rigged gun. He rushed forward, shoved Michele aside--and the gun fired, harmlessly, putting a round through the doorway into a far wall. Shortly after that, the telephone went dead.Now recalling this, Michele tells Stan that she now understands his totally amoral attitude. The detectives then take Stan away--and Stan wryly observes to himself that ""the simple closing of a door has brought me to the guillotine."" Michele and Charles remain behind, sadder but wiser."

Sensing danger, he quickly flees and goes down cobblestone streets and steps until he reaches a stable. Quickly he saddles a horse and secures the straps. He attempts to untie the rope, but suddenly the horse is startled and begins furiously bucking up and down, stomping him to death. Next we see a close-up of his face: half-mutilated with one eye hanging out. (Title shows.)Albert Kovac (Walter Brandi) is driving an open-air touring car down a country lane. He passes an old woman (in a deleted scene, he inquires of the woman where the castle is and she crosses herself). He turns into a drive leading up to a castle (Villa Hauff), parking in front. Removing his cap and putting it in the back seat, he retrieves his briefcase and goes to ring the bell at the front door.The bell will not ring, however. He knocks on the door and pushes it open. Entering, he calls out if anyone is home. He walks down the entrance hall, passing various statues and suits of armor. Hearing a noise behind him, he turns to see the maid, Louise (Tilde Till) who has come out from one of the rooms. He explains that no one answered when he came in. He asks her to introduce him and she opens a door and bids him enter. Inside, Corinne Hauff (Mirella Maravidi) is wiping off a standing suit of armor. He introduces himself and asks if she is the daughter of Dr. Jeronimus Hauff, which she confirms. She tells Louise to take the gentleman's coat. Louise is staring at Kovac as if she hasn't seen a man in years. Finally her attention is gained by Corinne and the coat is taken.He explains that he is an attorney who received a letter requesting he come and take care of Dr. Hauffs will. She leads him down a hall toward another room. On the way he notices a display case containing six mummified hands. He follows her into a bedroom where he is asked to show the letter. Giving it to Corinne, she hands it to Cleo Hauff (Barbara Steele) who is seated with cold cream on her face. Immediately she begins wiping her face and looks at the letter. Minutes later she emerges with her face clean and ready to talk.She asks if he is the attorney addressed on the envelope, Joseph Morgan (Riccardo Garrone). He explains that Morgan was absent when the letter arrived so he came at once since it seemed urgent. (In a deleted scene at the beginning of the film Morgan is seen leaving and Kovac reads the mail, finding the letter.) She reads from the letter and remarks how it looks like his writing and seal. He asks if her husband had told her about the letter. She responds that her husband has been dead for a year. Meanwhile there is a flash of lightning and the front door is blown open. Louise closes and bolts the door.Invited to stay the night, they are next seen at dinner, discussing the letter. Cleo speculates that it must be a fraud while Corinne insists that it is her fathers handwriting and seal. Cleo tells Kovac that the seal was buried with her husband and that she is his second wife. Kovac asks to smoke and is told of course . Louise enters and asks if she should serve the coffee. After this is done, she asks if she may be excused for the evening. Cleo excuses her and she politely curtsies to each of the ladies and leaves. Cleo remarks how not even a storm can keep Louise in the castle.Kovac tells them that the police will have to be informed of the death. Cleo tells him that it was Dr. Hauffs wish to be interred in the ground for one year before being laid to final rest. She says the villagers want nothing to do with this place, citing superstitions. Corinne corrects her, telling Kovac that her father was a spiritualist who tried to contact supernatural forces. She points to a bust of a woman which has three scratches on the cheek. He notes that they are real. Corinne says she believes it was done by something supernatural. Cleo tells her not to speak anymore of this. Cleo suggests that Kovac might want to telephone his office. Looking at his pocket watch, he remarks that Morgan is usually in his office at this time.Kovac picks up the phone, giving the operator Morgans number. All at once there is lightning and thunder and strange noises on the line. Outside we see part of the telephone line fall beside the grave of Jeronimus Hauff. Kovac asks the operator what is wrong with the line but she replies there is nothing wrong with it. At this point a strange man enters, carrying a candelabra. It is Kurt, the servant (Luciano Pigozzi) who stares at Kovac. We hear Kovac talking to himself, wondering about the strange man and how much he knows. Kurt closes the shutters and leaves the room just as Corinne enters. She tells Kovac that it is Kurt the gardener and that he has never left since the death of Dr. Hauff. Looking at a painting of the castle and surrounding area, she tells Kovac that hundreds of men died here, since it was once used as a hospital. As for the severed arms, Corinne tells him they are the mummified remains of those who spread the Black Plague. He makes a joke and she tells him not to, saying her father discovered many things about the house. She shows him to her fathers room, telling him to stay there for the night.Inside, he lights a cigarette, thinking of how strange the whole situation is. He finds another adjoining room and takes a candelabra in to see it. It is Dr. Hauffs office, where he finds an old Edison recording cylinder. Cranking it, he turns the needle to play the recording. It is the voice of Hauff, who talks about several people who were spreading the plague. When caught, their hands were severed before they were hanged. The remains were buried on the property. As he describes the sound of the wagon carrying corpses to a mass grave, the sounds of creaking wheels are heard outside. We see covered graves and wagon wheel tracks in the dirt.Corinne begins to undress in her room, when suddenly she turns to look and screams, covering herself. Kovac, hearing the scream, starts to her room. She comes out, claiming that she saw her father in her room. Cleo suggests that Corinne is too tired and on edge and has imagined it all. Entering her room, she reacts to the sight of a bronze bust of her father. Cleo tells her that it is only a statue. As they leave, Cleo tells Kovac that Corinne learned all of these things from her father. She says she will show Kovac where he died. They come to a long stairway going down below. She tells him that Dr. Hauff fell there and died. At the bottom of the stairs we see the face of Kurt, who looks up at them. Meanwhile, the recorded voice of Hauff, playing the last groove of the recording over and over, intones: I summoned them from their graves, and now I am among them.Outside, Kovac finds that an owl has gotten into his engine and caused damage (in a deleted scene we see the owl when Louise is admiring the car). When he asks Kurt how to get into town, he gets no reply. At this point Dr. Nemek (Alfredo Rizzo) walks up, telling Kovac that he will get nothing from Kurt. When Kovac shows the engine to Nemek, he says no one knows how to work on engines. Nemek explains that he is the new doctor for the area. Kovac asks for a ride into town and Nemek agrees. As they walk by the castle, he asks about what he sees. Nemek tells him that these are the unconsecrated graves of the plague spreaders from the fifteenth century. As they walk toward the horse and buggy, Corinne approaches and asks for a ride into town. They all get in and start out.Meanwhile, Cleo in their absence goes through the briefcase, removing documents to read. She asks the operator if the phone line to town has been repaired and is told it has. Then she hangs up.They arrive at a building where Nemek tells them he has to stop for a few minutes. He suggests they take a walk down by the lake. They do.Corinne talks about her father being misunderstood by everyone and that he had supernatural powers. She apologizes about her outburst last night, saying that he was in the room. They walk along the shoreline, past a number of small boats. She tells Kovac that her father used to bring her there often. She points out two sticks in the ground, a large one and a smaller one. Explaining that this is a sundial her father devised, she tells him that when the shadow of one touches the other, the time is right for fishing in the reeds. Turning back the other way, she suddenly screams my father! and runs into the reeds, falling down. Kovac chases her and she tells him that she saw her father in a boat in the reeds. We see it with an oar attached. She claims that the water dripping from the oar means it was just used. He tells her there is no one there. Frightened, she seeks comfort in his arms. Just then Nemek calls them to go back.They are seen in the home of Oskar Stinner (Ennio Balbo), a paralytic in a wheelchair. Corinne is seen dressing behind a sheet in silhouette. Her clothes which were hung by the fire are now dry and handed to her by Dr. Nemek. Kovac smokes and Corinne is shown getting dressed (shown behind the sheet). Nemek tells Kovac that Stinner has a fine wine for them. He gets the bottle and some glasses, explaining that he can smell a good wine for miles. Stinner refuses to drink, but wine is offered to Corinne and Kovac, who suggests they talk about the letter. He shows it to Nemek, who remarks how it looks authentic. Stinner asks to see it, telling them he has an old letter to compare it to. Pulling one out of his desk, he looks at both seals, saying they are the same. Kovac says the police must be informed. Stinner tells Corinne to get out of town before its too late. Nemek says they should get back home and tells Stinner not to worry and that he will come see him tomorrow. Kovac thanks Stinner and exits. Corinne hesitates by the door, telling Stinner she will see him again soon. As they leave, Stinner says to himself I will never see her again. I just know it. The day of revenge is at hand.Arriving at the local apothecary, Nemek tells them he knows the pharmacist who also serves as the mayor. Inside, he calls the mans name but gets no answer. They look around and Nemek continues to call out. As he looks behind the counter, he is horrified to see the man dead, with a bottle of acid dripping on his horribly disfigured face. They immediately get Corinne into the carriage to leave, telling her they will join her later. She drives off to return home.Inside the hall of records, Nemek fills out a death certificate and signs it, stating that cause of death was heart failure. Kovac asks whether the police should be involved but is told that a heart attack is not a violent death. Nemek asks the clerk for two forms, which he brings immediately. Looking at the forms, he asks the clerk why they are already filled out. He is told that the corpse collectors came by the village last night and that everyone knows when that happens that someone will die. Kovac says how could you know it would be the mayor? The clerk tells him it was one of the five men present at the death of Hauff and that they all are doomed to die.Cleo is seen in a bubble bath. Corinne enters and is asked to scrub Cleos back. Taking Corinnes hand, Cleo remarks how she is trembling. Corinne replies that she saw the mayors body, horribly eaten away by acid in the pharmacy. Cleo seems shocked and steps out of the bath. When asked if the mayor was her friend, Cleo says no, but he was one of the men who would come around to see Jeronimus. She states that all his friends were low-class individuals, not like what she was accustomed to. Corinne implies that her step-mother had been a performer. Cleo answers that she had to give up her career to marry Dr. Hauff, who became a crazy country doctor. She tells Corinne that it was not what she expected. Her friends formerly envied her. Rising to leave, Corinne tells her flat out that she is the same lousy actress she always was.Back at the hall of records, the clerk looks up and begins to read the death notice of Dr. Hauff, which was signed by the five men present at the time. He notes that three of them are dead and the remaining two have not long to live. Kovac takes the page with their names to study it. As Kovac calls out each of the three names, the clerk reads the fate of each one from the record. Asking who the fourth man is, the clerk is told Oskar Stinner. It is said that the name of the fifth man is unknown because the handwriting is illegible. Kovac expresses doubt that the friends of Hauff would want to kill him, but the clerk suggests they hated him because he dabbled in the occult.Back in his room, Kovac wonders about the fifth man. He plays the recording, hearing a girls voice singing remember pure water, pure water will save you. Looking out the window, he sees a young girl sitting at the fountain below. He goes down to the fountain but finds only the flowers the girl was holding, now discarded in the water.Stinner is seated at his desk when he hears the sounds of the corpse collectors wagon outside and declares that the end has come. After a torturous moment of worry, he rolls his wheelchair to the wall and removes a sword, which he places point-out from a chest of drawers. Backing up, he rushes upon the sword and kills himself. At this point the window opens from outside and we see Stinner dead from behind. One of the mummified hands is seen upon his shoulder, implying that it had come to kill him but was too late. The hand pulls Stinners wheelchair back off of the sword, which drips. We see from a front angle that Stinners intestines are hanging out. (In a deleted scene there is an alternative death scene where he dies by hanging himself instead of by sword.)Next day a policeman is shown investigating at Stinners place. Nemek tells him he will come by the station later to file a report. He tells the men to take the body away. Kovac asks Nemek if he still believes this is coincidence, to which Nemek replies he isn't sure anymore. When Kovac reminds him that they both heard the clerk predicting the death but they did nothing, Nemek replies that there is nothing they could have done to have prevented Stinner from taking his own life. Kovac suggests that maybe Hauff is still alive and that his body has not been seen, except by the witnesses. Finding a partially-burned note on the desk, Kovac shows in to Nemek, telling him that Stinner was writing it to warn the final victim, who was summoned. He tells him that tomorrow Hauffs body will be dug up to be re-interred. They are hoping to see the body at that time, which would prove whether Hauff is really dead.The next day at the cemetery a small gathering stands around the temporary grave. As the slab is removed from the grave, those present see that it is empty. Some gasping is heard from the ladies. Kovac thinks to himself so that means the fifth witness is in danger. He is directed to a phone to call his boss but is told he has left for the Villa Hauff. Explaining to Nemek, Kovac says the fifth witness is Morgan, since he was the one summoned by the original letter.Morgan enters the castle and looks around, seeing no one. He goes into another room and hears Dr. Hauff greeting him from a chair across the room (his face is not visible, but as Morgan nervously approaches, he notices a ring on Hauffs hand with a large jeweled J).Kovac and Nemek arrive and begin to search for Morgan. His hat is seen on a hallway table. Morgan comes out from the front room in a state of shock. The men sit him down. He tells them that he saw Jeronimus. When Kovac goes to search the room, he finds only a cat in the chair. He is given a sedative by Dr. Nemek. Kovac demands to know why he has come. Nemek suggests that this discussion take place later. Kovac leaves with an apology, giving Morgan the letter.Next we see Louise preparing to leave, questioned by Corinne about what she saw. She says she saw nothing, only feeling more coldness in the house than during a normal winter. Locking herself in the kitchen in fear, she tells Corinne she heard the voice of Jeronimus speaking. Asking what he said, she says to ask Kurt. At this point she leaves, saying that she can no longer remain in this house.Corinne apologizes to Kovac, telling him it is her fault for asking him to remain. She confesses her need for him and they kiss. At this point they are interrupted by Nemek, who asks for cognac. She goes to fetch it while the men sit down. Kovac tells Nemek that Morgan is highly believable, because he doesn't believe in ghosts. They both agree that Kurt needs to be found so that what he knows can be determined. Corinne enters with a tray and two glasses, carrying some kind of dispenser which she sets on the table. Nemek seems pleased and Corinne adjusts something on the dispenser.Louise is seen walking through the woods. Bird sounds are heard, which gradually give way to the sound of the corpse collectors cart. Louise looks around but sees nothing. She hurries away.Morgan is awakened by the door opening. Cleo comes in and he stands to greet her. From their conversation we learn that they had agreed to separate for one year after the death of Jeronimus, but Cleo tells him they cant just resume their affair now. Confessing his love, Morgan begins kissing her shoulder. Next they are seen in bed, kissing.Meanwhile Corinne goes to the attic with Kovac to look around. They find a doll, which she explains was hers. It contains a music box which plays. Kovac remarks that he knows that tune. Corinne tells him it is an old song which she then sings. He remembers it from the recording he heard before and wonders what is the meaning of pure water will save you?Cleo listens as Morgan reads the letter sent to his office, which was signed by Jeronimus. She asks if he believes Hauff wrote it. He tells her he knows who is behind all this. Checking his gun, he informs her that there was one more witness there that night: Kurt.Corinne and Kovac go down below into a crypt-like room where she calls out for Kurt. Hearing no answer, they leave. One wall opens and Kurt enters, carrying the body of Hauff, which he lays on the slab. He says to the corpse that the night of revenge has begun. He removes the ring (which contains the J used to make the seal) from Hauffs finger and places it in a torch, which causes it to flare up. Soon the hour of death will come, he says, which will free the spirits of the plague spreaders, who will begin killing the innocent and guilty alike. He confesses his loyalty to Hauff but asks forgiveness for having to break his vow of silence, since Corinne will have to be warned.Nemek asks whether they found Kurt, to which Kovac says no, telling him that they searched the entire house. At this moment Corinne screams as she sees Kurt coming in, his face all covered with oozing sores, signs of the plague. Nemek tells them not to touch him. Kurt says the night of his revenge has begun, and they are here. Pointing to a full-length mirror, he says that one year ago he saw it all happen here. In a flash-back sequence, we see the five men (not including Kurt) and Cleo all facing Jeronimus, who reveals that they had all signed a petition to run him out of town. He refuses to leave, telling them he knows too much about their sins and will alert the public. He addresses each one, telling what he knows. Finally he faces Cleo and Morgan, telling them he had known about their clandestine affair for some time. Morgan approaches him with a candlestick to strike him from behind. Encouraged by each face, he hesitates until Cleo cries out kill him, Joseph! Hauff is struck from behind and falls, cursing them all and telling them that they wont escape his anger.Coming out of the flashback, Cleo tells him to go back to the dead and throws a candlestick at the mirror, breaking it. Hauffs voice is heard summoning the dead spirits of the plague spreaders to avenge him. The grave covers are slid over and we see at least one hand emerging. Cleo cries no and begins to run. She goes from door to door but cannot escape. She opens a double outer door and screams. As she turns back inside, we see her face with signs of the plague. She staggers around the room, getting a glimpse of her face reflected in the tray. Finally she falls upon the harp and breathes her last. Morgan shouts that he will not die. Pulling out his gun, he tells Hauff that he is not afraid but begins acting like he is being stalked. Firing several shots, he too receives signs of the plague and collapses. As Kovac looks at him, he notices on a grandfather clock the painting of the young girl at the fountain, again wondering about the pure water that will save them. (In a deleted scene Kovac is told about the painting of this legendary girl who would save the village with purified water.) Thunder and lightning are heard. All at once he announces that water is the answer. He tells Nemek to take Corinne outside. She protests that she wants to remain with Kovac.Opening up a door, Kovac sees Louise, now covered with the plague. She dies in his arms. He goes outside to join the others. The sounds of the corpse collectors cart are heard and the open graves are viewed. Kovac tells them that it is the water that has kept the spirits away, and now that all the water is drying up, they can only hope for rain. Nemek takes Corinne aside and a mummified hand is seen in the bushes. When we see Nemek again, he has the plague, telling her not to touch him. Kovac stumbles around, backing away from an unseen spirit. Only the shadow is visible approaching him. As he is backed into a corner and sinks down, suddenly the menacing sounds stop and raindrops appear. Corinne calls out that it is raining and the two of them embrace. Saved from the avengers, they are seen walking off together as the rain comes down."
Young Cassidy,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059930/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The misadventures of a young idealist man in Dublin, Ireland in the early twentieth century. In Dublin circa 1911, John Cassidy (Rod Taylor), an impoverished idealist, whose ambitions are restricted by the demands of looking after his family, journeys through the social injustices of Dublin life, involving himself with the rowdy tramway-men strike, dawdling with prostitute Daisy Battles (Julie Christie), and seeking a better life. He falls in love with bookshop assistant Nora (Dame Maggie Smith) who encourages him toward a life of writing. Finding success at the Abbey Theatre, his unorthodox views estrange him from family, friends, and his own past.—alfiehitchie It's circa 1911 in Dublin. John Cassidy (Rod Taylor), an early known name ofSean O'Casey, is a working class bloke from a large family, which at the best of times has troubles trying to make ends meet. John's brusque exterior belies the heart of a writer, reading and writing, which were taught to him and fostered within him by his long departed sister. His natural exuberance is what attracts him to many people, including good-hearted prostitute Daisy Battles (Julie Christie), and fellow working class stiff Mick Mullen (Philip O'Flynn), who is the person who brings him into the realm of activism, especially in defending the working class and Irish nationalism by ending the oppression of the Irish through British rule. That activism eventually extends to his writing. It is his love of books and reading that he meets and falls in love with Nora (Dame Maggie Smith), a bookstore clerk. John eventually gets some of his works published, and his plays staged by the Abbey Theatre, which takes a chance by staging his plays that many Dubliners may view as placing them in a bad light. Bridging the gap between John's working class background and the higher class of the theatre may be difficult not only for Johnny, but for the Abbey Theatre founders,William Butler Yeats(Sir Michael Redgrave), and Lady Gregory (Dame Edith Evans), and for John's working class friends, including Nora.—Huggo"

The Truth About Spring,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058691/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the 1960s, a Caribbean sailor and his tomboy daughter search for buried treasure but run into unsavory characters and a cute lawyer who's after romance. Tommy Tyler (Sir John Mills), a lazy Caribbean sailor and his tomboy daughter, Spring (Hayley Mills), are out to search for a buried treasure. Tommy brings aboard William Ashton (James MacArthur), a young lawyer to help with the search. Ashton turns out to be handy when they encounter dangerous rivals. Tommy also tries to play match maker between Ashton and Spring-a difficult task indeed.—Kelly Tommy Tyler (Sir John Mills) and his eighteen-year-old daughter Spring (Hayley Mills) are all each other have in the world, with his wife/her mother long having died. They live aboard the ""Sarah Tyler"", the sailboat Tommy built thirty years ago for his wife, out of Catfish Key, and sail the Caribbean. Tommy is the type of person who would rather manipulate others to get what they need to survive on the seas than do any work, that manipulating which he seems to be able to do quite easily. Because of life on the seas and no mother figure, Spring has always been and still is a tomboy. She also has no idea of many of the western world's social conventions, especially when it comes to femininity. Into their lives enters blue blooded William Ashton (James MacArthur) of Philadelphia, he, a recent Princeton law school graduate. As he just passed the bar exam, Bill is vacationing with his Uncle Charles Skelton (David Tomlinson) aboard his yacht before he heads back to Philadelphia to start work. Because Bill wants more outdoor adventure on his vacation than his uncle is able to provide, Tommy invites him to sail with them for a few weeks, an invitation which Bill accepts. Tommy has ulterior motives in that as Spring has become a woman without her even knowing it, he wants her to experience womanly things, like the flush of romance, which he believes will happen between her and Bill if they only spend time together. Beyond the question of whether something will happen between Spring and Bill, and if it does, if there is a future for them, they get thrown into an adventure of another kind as Tommy is in possession of a map pointing to a sunken ship with a reported stash of two hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of gold. However, Tommy doesn't have the means to retrieve the gold. Another problem is that cutthroat José Carkez (Lionel Jeffries) and his right hand thug Judd Sellers (Harry Andrews) know that Tommy has the map, they will do anything to get their hands on it, and they do have the means to retrieve the sunken treasure. Although initially wanting to use Bill as a lawyer in the matter, Tommy figures the best way to get what he wants is to negotiate with Carkez, with Bill a reliable witness to prevent Carkez and Sellers from killing him for it. Thrown into the mix is Cleary (Niall MacGinnis), Carkez's partner, who is more an enemy who is better to have close at hand. Tommy may have further protection in pitting Cleary and Carkez against each other, that a risky maneuver as Cleary is even more willing to kill to get what he wants than Carkez.—Huggo"

Enjoy the opening and closing shots of the alien spacecraft resembling a Christmas tree bauble dancing in space, the faces of the ""duplicated"" humans shattering like a cheap vase when thrown to the floor, and the formative ""duplicates"" as they are cooked up in the lab in individual coffins. The alien's heart is softened by the persevering goodness of a beautiful blind woman, deeply conflicting his motives as the film plods to its ""climactic"" confrontation between the humans and their counterfeit duplicates.—Stephen J Neilson <sneilson@ix.netcom.com> The movie opens with a Christmas ornament shaped space craft heading to Earth. Title and credits follow as we see inside the craft. Dr. Kolos (Richard Kiel) turns off the revolving crystal object on the pedestal and activates the communications panel on the wall. He reports he has arrived at Earth to the Galaxy Being (Ted Durant) and is told his task is to establish a colony. He is given the name of an Earth scientist to assist him in his work. Kolos is warned that if his mission fails he will be destroyed. Kolos beams down to Earth in front of the palatial home of Professor Dornheimer. He rings the bell and is met by Thor, the butler (John Indrisano). Thor looks up at the giant man and asks, ""Can I help you, sir?"" When Kolos asks to see the professor he is told Dornheimer is busy and he should call to make an appointment. Kolos forces his way into the house, easily brushing the butler aside. Inside the house, Kolos is drawn to the sound of a piano being played. He enters the music room and sees Lisa Dornheimer (Dolores Faith). She is wearing a yellow dress and asks if it is the butler who entered the room. Kolos passes his huge hand in front of Lisa's face to confirm the young woman is blind. Kolos introduces himself and explains that he is a colleague of the professor. ""I have traveled a great distance to see him,"" he explains to Lisa. Kolos knew of Lisa, but admits to her that he didn't realize how beautiful she was. She explains that despite her blindness, she can easily navigate the house. ""You see I grew up here. I know every inch of this house by heart,"" she explains to the alien. She escorts him to the basement lab, where two female lab assistants, one blonde (Margaret Teele) and one brunette (Alean 'Bambi' Hamilton), assist Professor Vaughn Dornheimer (George Macready) with a seated robot. He tells the old man, ""I've come to assist you in your experiments."" Dornheimer tells Kolos he needs no assistance, but Kolos insists, ""Together we shall create an android in a few days.""A car pulls up to the Space Research Corporation. Dr. Munson (Mel Ruick as Melville Ruick) checks in with the guard who notes that Munson is starting work early. Munson behaves strangely, signs in for the computer room, and forces the door. The alarm is triggered and the guard catches Munson loading equipment into his briefcase. Munson attacks and kills the guard, Johnson. He knocks the other guard down as he flees the company. Despite three slugs in his back, Munson drives off. Glenn Martin (George Nader), a member of the NIA (National Intelligence Agency) arrives and quickly brushes off two reporters, one white (Tommy Leonetti) and the other black (Lonnie Sattin). Lt. Shaw (Richard Arlen) is already on the scene and briefs Martin on the robbery. We learn there is a pattern; three robberies in the last three months all with the same M.O.: Respected members of the staff responsible and electronic components stolen. Shaw is told that Munson's car was located. Shaw and Martin drive to Stone Canyon (Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California). They walk down into the canyon and find Munson's body.In the NIA field office, Austin Welles (Hugh Beaumont) and Martin review the latest in industrial thefts. Welles thinks the Russians or the Chinese may be behind the cases, but Martin dismisses both. He thinks another scientist will be involved, but who? Gale Wilson (Barbara Nichols) enters the office. She has the information from the coroner's office on the death of Dr. Munson. It was assumed he either died from gunshot wounds or the fall over the cliff into Stone Canyon, but Gale reports he was electrocuted. She tells her boss, ""Dr. Munson was dead at least twelve hours before they found him in the canyon."" Martin and Gale have an on again, off again romance and love to needle each other. Miss Hart (Lori Lyons) brings her boss his pill and some water. Martin asks about the Dornheimer Estate and Gale reports that he is a famous scientist, on the science advisory board until recently. Welles adds that if a scientist has a problem he consults with the old professor.Martin drives his yellow Mustang over to see the professor. He is unaware he is being followed by Thor, Dornheimer's butler, in a large, black 1962 Cadillac. Kolos confronts Lisa in the living room. She has been barred from visiting the Laboratory downstairs. Lisa voices her observation that everyone in the household is acting strangely and that she is practically a prisoner in the house. Martin rings the bell and Thor answers the door. Martin explains that he is with View magazine and that he wants to do a feature article on the professor. Thor invites him inside. While waiting, Martin meets Lisa on the stairs and hands her the scarf she dropped earlier. Lisa tries to warn Martin, but Dornheimer enters the room. Lisa runs back upstairs. The two men discuss philosophy until Thor interrupts telling Dornheimer that Kolos wants to speak to him. Martin checks the room, but is observed by someone. Thor escorts Martin out of the house. Martin drives away, and again is followed by Thor in the Cadillac.Gale sits by the pool and answers the phone. Glenn Martin is calling her from a pay phone. Before hanging up, he asks Gale to stop at the library and pick up copies of Dornheimer's books. They agree to meet for dinner. They are being watched at the restaurant by a man at the bar. At Gale's apartment, Glenn reads one of Dornheimer's books. He asks Gale what she knows about Cybernetics. He explains, ""Dornheimer is the chief exponent of the field. He is the father of the thinking machine."" Glenn concludes that an android could be made to look exactly like a human being, like Dr. Munson for instance. Martin returns to the Dornheimer estate. He climbs a ladder to a storeroom above and finds body parts that look like mannequin components. He also finds an assortment of heads, including one of Dr. Munson. The two lab assistants approach wheeling someone or something on a gurney. They enter and then exit a room, this time the gurney is empty. It is a cold storage room loaded with caskets. One casket contains a woman who looks like one of the lab assistants, another the body of the spy at the restaurant. The third casket contains Thor, the butler. A vertically stacked coffin contains the body of the blonde lab assistant. She topples out and breaks on the floor like a china cup. Glenn quickly exits the cold storage room and wanders into the lab. He observes Dornheimer, the two lab assistants, and the Chinese scientist, Dr. Lin Yeung (Kim Satana) standing in a large glass cylinder. In a second cylinder a metal skeleton appears. It is quickly covered with an outer shell of tissue. A duplicate of Dr. Yeung appears, dressed in the same clothes. Lisa joins Martin on the stairs above the lab. He explains that her uncle is a murderer, but she corrects Martin. She explains that the real professor is locked up in the basement, ""That man down there is only a copy of my uncle. A twin created by Kolos."" Their conversation draws Dornheimer's attention. Martin confronts the professor. Thor climbs the stairs and Martin shoots him repeatedly, with no effect whatsoever. Kolos appears and distracts Martin which gives Thor the opportunity to knock the government agent out. But Martin is conscious enough to throw Thor off the staircase. His head breaks like a cheap, plaster vase when it hits the floor. Dornheimer tells Martin, ""Yes Mr. Martin, androids. Superhuman robots, the force of tomorrow."" Kolos explains that they will build whatever they need, including a secret agent if necessary. Kolos drags Martin down into the lab where the duplication process is started on Martin. Dornheimer orders his lab assistants to prepare the duplication chamber for Mr. Martin. He injects a sedative into the government agent. After the body is duplicated, Dornheimer and the two lab assistants install the electrical components in the android skull. The final process duplicates memories from the human to the android.Welles is in his office with Gale when he gets a phone call. He is notified of a robbery at Pacific Laboratories and the culprit is Dr. Lin Yeung. Martin walks into Welles' office and tells his boss he knows where the next robbery will take place, but his information is the same as was reported to Welles. Gale asks if Dornheimer is behind the robberies, Glenn quickly corrects her, ""Dornheimer, of course not. He's one-hundred percent in the clear, he wants to help us. And he did."" Glenn asks for permission to go to Washington to check on a few leads. Gale remarks to Welles that Glenn behaved strangely. She asks her boss if he would recognize an android if he saw one? Lisa overhears Kolos making a report to the Galaxy Being. She learns that Glenn Martin has been duplicated and that he will be kept alive until his copy has completed his first assignment. The final matter is that of Lisa. The Galaxy Being wants to know why she hasn't been duplicated and the human destroyed. Kolos explains that she serves no useful purpose, so he decided to leave her human, but the Galaxy Being reproaches him for such independent thinking. The Galaxy Being orders her duplicated and the original destroyed immediately. The Android Dornheimer agrees with the Galaxy Being, but Kolos reminds the professor that he is in charge and he, Kolos, will make the decision regarding Lisa.Lisa enters the dungeon area to talk to Glenn Martin. She asks about her uncle, who shares the cell with Martin. She is told he needs medical attention. Martin mentions a coin and Lisa informs him that she found one on the steps down to the lab. Martin asks her to return later with the coin. Gale is watching someone from her car. She follows the car to the U.S. Government Supply Depot. Gale walks in following Glenn. She catches him red handed stealing electronic supplies. He pulls a gun on her, so she runs screaming. Martin follows her and assaults the military escort. The Navy officer is knocked to the ground; his head breaks like a plaster cast. The military guards chase Martin; one stops to examine the damaged android Navy officer. Glenn gets into a gun fight with the police and his boss, Welles. His arm is caught in a warehouse door and is torn free from his body. Glenn escapes in the 4-door black Lincoln Continental, but swerves leaving the parking lot and crashes into Gale's parked car. The police give chase.Kolos is in Lisa's room. He is amused by the music box on her makeup table and plays with Martin's coin. Lisa enters her room and confronts Kolos. He tells her she is a threat to security. Lisa fiddles with a small doll and deliberately drops it on the floor to distract Kolos so she can retrieve the coin. Kolos admits to the young woman, ""What I have done here on your planet is not my choice. Can you believe in that?"" He also tells her that he will be destroyed if his mission fails. He has romantic feelings for the blind woman. As Kolos returns to the lab, Professor Dornheimer and two of the copies of Thor watch him. Dornheimer tells the closest Thor, ""First Kolos, then Lisa."" Lisa descends the stairs and walks towards the secret entrance to the dungeon, but she is observed by the two female lab assistants. Lisa pulls back a large chest of drawers that acts as a door, the lab assistants follow. In the lab, Dornheimer and Thor confront Kolos. Kolos reminds the professor, ""You dare give me orders, professor? It is I who give the orders. I am your master!"" Dornheimer corrects the giant man and proclaims himself in charge. Six copies of Thor take Kolos into custody. Lisa walks past the struggle and walks to the cell Glenn occupies. The lab assistants follow her. She gives Glenn the coin and tells him of the android insurrection. Glenn uses a cutting wire built into the coin to saw his way through the bars on his cell. The lab assistants enter and take Lisa back into the lab, where Kolos is chained to the wall. Dornheimer tells Kolos he made a mistake when he gave the androids more wisdom than he possessed.Glenn continues to work on the bars. Dornheimer tells him that the androids have a weakness and a device in the lab, a pulse laser beam, is the answer; aim it at their heads. Lisa is prepared for duplication by the two lab assistants. Glenn finally cuts through two bars and escapes his cell. He runs into the lab as Kolos breaks free of his chains. Kolos battles with the six Thor copies as Glenn maneuvers the laser gun into place. Glenn aims the beam at the Thors. Dornheimer flees the lab. The beam has its effect as the Thors begin to battle each other. Dornheimer runs outside but stops when he sees the duplicated Glenn Martin return home. He walks back inside and confronts the human Glenn Martin on the stairs. The copy enters the room and asks to see the master. Dornheimer orders the duplicate to kill the human Glenn. It refuses, so Dornheimer attacks it with a mace. Just as the fight concludes with both androids collapsing, Welles, Gale and two police officers arrive in the house. Kolos carries a sedated Lisa from the lab back upstairs to the living room and gently places her on the couch. Kolos tells Glenn, ""Mr. Martin, I was sent here to prepare your society for conquest by the masters of the galaxy. I have failed in my mission. I have failed, not because I am weak, but because you are stronger. I will leave your planet now. I must return to a world of cold and unemotional galaxy beings. I will give them my report and then I will be destroyed. But it will not matter, you see, Mr. Martin. I know now that I too am an android."" Kolos kneels next to Lisa and stares at her. Tears stream down his face and fall on hers. She wakes and smiles. Kolos walks outside and beams back up to his spaceship. Inside the ship, Kolos stares back at the Earth. We close with the spaceship flying away from Earth."

In court, the judge has no hesitation in sentencing them to fifteen years in prison.Fifteen years later they get out, and Gorge's girlfriend Myrtle is waiting for them. They go to her house, and she wants an amorous celebration, but George is intent on going to the tree to retrieve the money from the tree. But when they get there, a housing estate has been built over the area where the tree stood. The go into ""Oldfield New Town"" to see whether the tree is still standing.They get to Lovers Walk, where the tree was located, and looking over a high wall, they see that the tree is indeed still there. George decides that the thing to do is to get into the enclosed yard by saying that they are policemen investigating a robbery, but then they discover that the high wall is in fact the perimeter of a police station.Inside the police station, the sergeant is thinking about the police concert, while a young constable Harold, knows that the gang has just been released, and that the money was never recovered. He is speculating that the gang might be nearby looking for the money.
There is a house nearby with rooms to let, and Myrtle enquires, and takes two double rooms. She has designs on manipulating George into marrying her, and she tells him that the landlady will only let the rooms if they are a married couple. Very reluctantly George agrees, and we see them marrying in the registry office.They go to the house where they are going to stay, and are let in by the owner's daughter, who is a sultry girl, Sally. Seeing her, one of the men, Dipper Day, says that this must be his lucky day. The owner, Mildred Gameley, arrives and talks to them, and lets slip that she didn't know that George and Myrtle were married; Myrtle had lied to George, telling him that Mrs Gameley would insist on them being married.Suddenly Harold, the young police constable, bursts in to the dismay of the crooks. But he is just another lodger in the house. Now they are in their room, and Dipper arrives with a telescope that he has stolen from the park. It is the kind where you have to put 6d in a slot for a few minutes' use, but George is able to see the tree where the money is hidden. Dipper and George are looking through the telescope and see that a girl opposite is dressing in her bedroom, but there is a ladder against her window. She is eloping, but George sends them to get the ladder, to sue it to get into the police station yard. The man who is eloping has gone back up to the girl's room to leave a not for her Mother, and he is now marooned there, as George's men have taken the ladder. The three have climbed on to the police station wall and sat to rest, when the eloping girl comes and retrieves the ladder, without questioning why it had been placed there. The three are struggling on top of the wall when Harold, the policeman, comes out of the police station office and shouts at them. He pulls at the trouser legs of Booky and his trousers come off, but the three fall to the outside of the wall and run off.The next morning in the police station yard, a workman has come out and is investigating the hole in the tree where the money is. Myrtle comes in and is displeased because George hasn't been attentive to her. They go down to breakfast, except Booky who hasn't got any trousers. George mentions at breakfast that a rare bird is in the tree; there is considerable wordplay on ""Great Bustard"" and ""Little Bustard"". Harold says that the tree is to be cut down next week. Mrs Gameley the landlady takes a tray up to Booky, and he quickly, but with difficulty, conceals the telescope on the bed with him. Mrs Gameley evidently has romantic designs on Booky.George bursts in and she leaves, and Dipper arrives with a pair of trousers for Booky. He took them from an airing cupboard, and it turns out that they belong to Harold, the policeman.They decide to fire a harpoon at the tree, and one of them will slide down on the rope. They are setting up the harpoon gun the next evening and fire the harpoon, but they forgot to retain the end of the rope. A second attempt is more successful. But the zipwire trip doesn't work; Dipper just hits the wall. It is not clear how Dipper would have returned if he had been successful.Harold finds the harpoons the next morning but the station sergeant is more interested in the forthcoming concert, and expresses no interest in investigating the matter.The workmen arrive to cut the tree down, but when they go to their truck for their equipment, the robbers have taken it away, as they intend to use the tools themselves. The workman goes to report it to the station sergeant, who is sarcastically reluctant to be distracted from his musical preparation. He insists on going out to check the location from which it was stolen, but it has been replaced, but the tools are missing, leading to further sarcastic reluctance.George now decides that a tunnel is the means of getting inside the police station yard, but their bedrooms are on an upper floor. Booky is told by George to try to talk Mildred Gameley into letting the gang use her ground floor bedroom. She has marital designs on Booky, and refuses the swap without a proposal of marriage.George coerces Booky into marrying her, which he does with extreme reluctance. They take possession of her room and start the tunnel. Mildred Gamely and Myrtle are both disappointed brides, waiting alone in bed as their husbands concentrate on the tunnel; disposing of the spoil is a problem and they adopt a number of unlikely ruses to do so.Meanwhile at the police station Harold suddenly sees a police warning about the three robbers, during yet another rehearsal for the police concert. He rushes over to the house, and he realises they must be intending to get to the tree. Mildred's daughter shuts Harold in a bedroom, and Mildred tells Myrtle and her daughter that her deceased husband was a burglar; she is obviously on their side. She takes charge, and gets his tools and scales the wall and gets the money. At the same time the men have opened up the tunnel under the police choir, due to a miscalculation. The robbers escape back to the house as the policemen fall into the hole.The three women and the three robbers open up the briefcase, but the money had been destroyed by vermin, and is worthless. When Mildred hears that it was only £50,000 she is dismissive, and says that she has been planning a big train robbery that will net a million pounds. She will run the gang now, and this time the plan will work."

Parker, who has replaced his Soviet togs with the nearest uniform--Wilbur's--is forced to impersonate Wilbur and is given the rank of Army captain. Later, while in a control tower with WAC ""Smitty"" Smith, Parker accidentally turns on the air raid warning at the very moment a Japanese air squadron is about to make a sneak attack. For his heroism, Parker is again promoted--to Army major. When he and Binghamton are suspended in their jeep in midair by an airplane, they spot a Japanese fleet; and with an early warning, they aid an Allied victory. Parker becomes a national hero--despite the protests of Lieutenant Harkness, now released--and speeds his way to Washington to be decorated by President Roosevelt. Tim Conway plays WW II PT-boat Navy Ensign Parker who must disguise himself to escape from a sticky situation -- unfortunately (one would think) for him, the uniform with which he absconded belongs to the son a 4-star general. Mistaken for the misplaced general's son, Parker constantly finds himself in situations for which his incompetence ill-prepares him, and yet he not only succeeds (incredibly) but does so while battling the nervous stresses added by the continual presence of Capt. Binghamton.Parker is almost immediately given a desk job (surrounded with, um, ""physically blessed"" WAC officers) and from there is assigned a navigator's position on a bomber. Although scared to fly and totally incompetent at navigation, he does somehow survive the flight. This follows a muffed turn in a flight trainer and grabbing a room in the WAC barracks (yes, hilarity ensued).Throughout, Ensign Parker is accompanied by nervous nellie Capt. Binghamton, who of course sees disaster around every corner of the plot and is usually the recipient of whatever embarrassment comes their way."

Fifteen year old tomboy Billie Carol, the younger of two daughters of Harding mayoral candidate Howard G. Carol and his wife Agnes Carol, is naturally athletic. She attributes her speed to being able to hear what she calls ""the beat"": music she hears in her head, speeding up that music which makes her go faster in whatever activity. She catches the eye of her high school's track and field coach, the school which only has a boys' track and field team which she is asked to join. Her father encourages her to do so despite he having recently made a campaign speech to a group of young women on his stance that women should not compete with men. This dichotomy causes a problem in his campaign. Another potential problem in the campaign is some unknown information about his older daughter, twenty year old Jean, who is home from school and who he still sees as his little girl. Billie, on the other hand, is often viewed by Howard as the son he never had, which often causes problems in his relationship with her. But Billie has other problems, especially in her relationship with Mike Benson, a student new to school and an aspiring decathlete. Mike and Billie like each other in a boy/girl sense - her first case of young love - but does not know how to reconcile that feeling with Mike wanting her to be a girl first and a track star second.—Huggo"

But can he make it on his own ability down south?—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Is a continuation of the story of working class social climber Joe Lampton ten years afterRoom at the Top (1958). He had long ago achieved what he set out to do when he moved to the mill town of Warnley: he married Susan Brown, the daughter of the wealthiest and most influential man in town, the wool mill owner and a member of town council, and additionally became a sales executive at his father-in-law's mill, Joe and Susan as a result able to live in comfort with their two children in a beautiful suburban house. But Joe isn't happy being on the proverbial hamster wheel of the upper class without anything substantive behind it. Part of that wheel is Mr. Brown wanting him to follow in his political footsteps in running for council for the Conservative Party solely for the clout that comes along with it purely in towing the party line. At home, he doesn't believe Susan respects him in always running to daddy whenever she wants anything - Joe long ago having put aside any pretense of sexual interest in her in their marital problems - and also believes their adolescent son Harry will turn out to be just like his maternal grandfather in Mr. Brown making all the important decisions about the children's upbringing.

Within this situation, Joe contemplates having an affair of his own, the most likely candidate being Norah Hauxley, an on-air television personality recently arrived in town, she who sees her work in Bradford solely as a necessary stepping stone for a higher profile job in London. As that affair with Norah turns into talk of Joe possibly leaving Susan, Joe has to weigh the pros and cons specifically of turning his back on all he's worked for, factoring in if he is able or unable to prove to the world that he can make it on his own without the Brown name.—Huggo"

Based on what people that he encounters infer or tell him, he is wealthy Steve Mallory, got his money by marrying the boss' daughter, neglects his seductive wife Alex Mallory, manages a chinaworks factory called Parsons & Co. that he is contemplating recommending to the company board to sell, and has a quick temper especially during his many drinking spells. Along with Alex, he lives on the Parsons estate with Alex's cousin Oliver Parsons, Oliver's mother Catherine Parsons, and Alex's father Austin Parsons, the company president who is currently in a comatose state from a stroke suffered three months ago. Austin's current state is the reason why Steve assumed the company management.

With no memory, Steve falls in love with Alex all over again on first sight, and wants to do right regardless of what he was contemplating doing prior to the amnesia. It may not be easy as some may not forgive past incidents, while other try to manipulate him, taking advantage of the fact of the amnesia.—Huggo"

Case escapes under the cover of darkness but Connelly is captured. On his return to Fort Kandahar, Case is accused of deliberately abandoning Connelly to the enemy and of cowardice as he made no attempt to rescue Connelly. The love affair between Connelly's wife and Case is well-known at the fort and many officers suspect that Case abandoned Connelly to his fate in order to have Connelly's wife. When Case is court-martialed, he defends himself against these accusations but the court mercilessly discharges him from the army and sentences him to 10 years in the brig. Case's native man-servant comes to visit Case in the fort's prison and eliminates the guards, freeing Case. The two run away in the desert where the servant reveals to Case that he is in fact a spy of Ali Khan. He takes Case to the rebel chieftain who offers to hire Case to work for his rebellious tribes. Emboldened by revenge against his former commander, Case accepts to work for Ali Khan and train his troops, provided they don't attack or harm civilians or captured prisoners. Case and Khan's sister Ratina become good friends. Case and Khan gradually learn to trust one-another. But for the British, Case is an escaped prisoner and a traitor. The British place a bounty on Case's head. Unfazed by this, Case continues to train Khan's men, fight numerous skirmishes against small British patrols and prepare for the upcoming assault against Fort Kandahar. The fort's commandant requests and awaits reinforcements from other nearby forts. However, Case has conflicting feelings. On one side he hates his former commander and wishes to kill him and on the other side he still thinks of himself as being British.—nufs68 In 1850 at Fort Kandahar, a British outpost on the North West frontier of India, a British Bengal Lancer officer Captain Boyd [Inigo Jackson] confronts Elsa Connelly [Katherine Woodville] in her quarters at the fort. Her husband is on an expedition with her lover, the half Indian Lieutenant Robert Case, and the officers do not condone Elsa and Case's affair.When Case [Ronald Lewis] returns to the fort he informs Colonel Drewe [Duncan Lamont] that Captain Connelly has been captured alive by Indian Ghilzhai rebel Eli Khan [Oliver Reed]. Case believes Khan will attack the fort at Kandahar but Drewe dismisses him. Instead Drewe decides to falsely charge Case for cowardice. Case is arrested and court marshalled. He is found guilty, discharged from the army and sentenced to 10 years in prison.Indian servant Rattu [Sean Lynch] rescues Case from the fort prison and leads him on an escape on horseback. When they stop to rest, they are surrounded by Khan's men. It transpires it was planned and Rattu is working for Khan. They lead Case to Khan's hideout in some mountain caves.At the hideout Khan introduces Case to his sister Ratina [Yvonne Romain] and asks Case to join him in the fight against the British who betrayed him. Case agrees on the condition that civilians and prisoners are spared. They agree and Case uses his military experience to help train Khan's men.At the fort, Drewe decides to send troops out to attack the rebels but the first patrol is attacked and defeated by Khan's men. Boyd sees Case is now assisting Khan so after Boyd returns to the fort, Drewe orders his men to search the surrounding villages for Case.Back at Khan's hideout, a few British prisoners are being forced to work as slaves including Connelly [Jeremy Burnham]. Case contemplates shooting him out of mercy because he is nearly dead but decides against it because he is being watched by Ratina.The British soldiers continue to search the villages, taking men prisoner for questioning. At the fort Drewe receives orders to offer his assistance to a reporter Marriott [Glyn Houston], who is travelling around North West India reporting on the conflicts. Marriott interviews Elsa about the disappearance of her husband. She is unwilling to talk openly but agrees she thinks Case is responsible. Meanwhile the junior officers question the village prisoners and try to threaten and bribe them but none of them will admit to knowing where Case is. Only when Drewe threatens to shoot one of the prisoners does he agree to talk.Drewe arranges a patrol to find Khan's hiding place and Marriott goes with them, but they are ambushed by Khan's men. Boyd is killed and Marriott and a couple of soldiers are taken prisoner. At Khan's camp, Case insists the prisoners are treated fairly. One of the prisoners tries to escape and is shot. Marriott tries to talk to Case about what happened to Connelly but Case is reluctant to talk to him.Khan is preparing for the final battle but Ratina is impatient and wants Case to lead the men against the British sooner. She still holds a grudge against Khan for killing their brother. Case is reluctant because he does not want to betray Khan.Case can no longer stand Connelly's suffering so he shoots him out of mercy. Case releases Marriott, sending him back to the fort to secure the safe release and passage of all prisoners and civilians before Khan's men attack. He gives his word they will be safe and only wants to kill Drewe because of his betrayal.At the fort Drewe agrees to release the civilians including Elsa with an escort of a few soldiers. One of Khan's men spots them and Ratina orders the slaughter of them all, going against the promise that Case made. All are killed except Marriott, who is knocked out, and Elsa who is taken prisoner. At Khan's hideout Elsa confronts Case and Ratina orders Elsa be shot. However, Case stops her from being executed. Khan returns and wants Elsa for himself but again Case intervenes so Khan challenges him to a fight. While everyone is distracted by the sword fight, Elsa makes her escape and finds Marriott outside the caves. After a lengthy fight, Case eventually overpowers Khan and strangles him.Marriott and Elsa return to the fort to warn Drewe of the impending attack by Khan's men. Led by Case the rebels ride towards the fort. They encounter a small group of soldiers on horseback lead by Drewe and pursue them, but are led into a trap and ambushed by a large number of soldiers. During an intense and lengthy battle, Case and Drewe have a sword fight but Case is shot and wounded. He and the surviving rebels retreat back towards the caves pursued by Drewe and a group of soldiers. At the caves they find Case and open fire wounding him further. Ratina appears and opens fire but is shot by Drewe. Case and Ratina crawl towards each other and die touching hands.As Marriott prepares to leave the fort he tells Drewe he could write about Case, the man who was loyal and brave but was betrayed by his commanding officer because of his love for another woman and the colour of his skin, but he'll actually write about the heroics of the British Lancers but not their commanding officer."

Angered by his father's decision, Muruga goes to the hill abode of Palani in the guise of a hermit. Goddess Parvathi comes and narrates four of the divine games of Shiva to calm Muruga down.The first story tells of the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, the capital city of the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a question posed by his wife (whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or caused by the cosmetics she uses on her hair) and announces a reward of 1000 gold coins to anyone who could come up with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts breaking down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, who hears his cries, takes the form of a poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes it to the court and recites the poem, but the ego-filled Tamil poet Nakkeerar claims the poem's meaning to be incorrect. After arguing with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, Shiva burns him into ashes. Later, he revives Nakkeerar, saying that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar requests the king to give the reward to Dharumi.The second story is when Shiva marries Dhatchayini against the will of her father Dhatchan. Dhatchan also performs a Mahayagna without inviting his son-in-law. Dhatchayini asks Shiva's permission to go to the ceremony but Shiva refuses to let her go as he feels no good will come out of it. Dhatchayini disobeys him and goes there, only to be insulted by Dhatchan. Dhatchayini curses her father and returns to Shiva to find him angry at her for disobeying him. Dhatchayini asserts that they are one and without her, there is no Shiva. Shiva refuses to agree with her and burns her to ashes trying to prove her wrong and performs his Tandava, which is noticed by the Devas, who pacify Shiva. Shiva decides to restore Dhatchayini to life.The third story describes Parvathi being banished by Shiva when her attention wavers for a moment while listening to Shiva, who was explaining the essence of the Vedas to her. Parvathi, now born as Kayarkanni, is the daughter of a fisherman. When playing with her friends, a strange fisherman (Shiva) approaches and flirts with her, despite her disapproval. The fishermen often face problems due to a giant shark that disrupts their way of life. Shiva asserts that he alone can defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva kills the shark (which is actually Nandi) and remarries Parvathi.The last tale narrated by Parvathi is when Shiva takes the form of a firewood vendor. Hemanatha Bhagavathar, a skilled singer, tries to conquer the Pandya Kingdom when he challenges the kingdom's musicians. The King's minister advises him to seek the help of Banabathirar, a devotional singer, to challenge Hemanatha Bhagavathar. When all musicians reject the competition, the King orders Banabathirar to compete against Hemanatha Bhagavathar. Knowing that he cannot win, the troubled Banabathirar prays to Shiva. Shiva, in the form of a firewood vendor, shows up outside Hemanatha Bhagavathar's house and shatters his arrogance by singing the song, ""Paattum Naane"". When Hemanatha Bhagavathar comes to know that the vendor was Banabathirar's student, he gets embarrassed and leaves the kingdom that very night leaving a note to Banabathirar informing him of his departure. Shiva gives the letter to Banabathirar and reveals his true identity to him. Banabathirar thanks Shiva for his timely help.After listening to these stories, Muruga's rage finally subsides and he reconciles with his family."

Before tests, they have to ready the tanks for trials in a hangar. One POW prevents another from sabotaging a tank, and plots something with others.
Three POWs and a French concentration camp inmate crew a tank and drive to the proving grounds. In the trials they are shelled but survive and, by a ruse, pretend the tank is knocked out. When the Germans approach, they are able to steal a weapon and speed away, crashing out of the proving area and wreaking havoc in a nearby town where they do a smash and grab raid at a clothes shop.
They flee into the countryside as search parties are mobilized. They drive through a field of female workers from the east who recognize the tank as one of theirs and run after it. The tank continues leaving the desperate women behind before stopping for the occupants to savor their temporary freedom, change clothes and split up.
Two POWs try to escape separately on foot and come close to being captured before the tank re-appears to rescue them both. With all four back on board they continue on their way, driving through towns shooting at German soldiers, demolishing buildings, bridges and a town center memorial statue, where they also stop to get refreshments from a bierkellar. They are able to tune in to Moscow radio and a French broadcast which prompts the Frenchman to amuse his colleagues with a mime act. By now there are multiple reports of the tank's movements leading to fear and panic among the German civilians and much anger within the German military command.

Then another explosion kills the Frenchman. The tank later stops while the others bury him.
Heavily armed German reinforcements approach and one of the crew hides in a barn to ambush them as the tank is driven off. Another crewman runs to assist him but both are killed.
The tank driver continues along the road alone as more forces surround him. Then a German child falls on the road in front of him.

However, Lon doesn't know that things have changed for worse in Texas and within his family, since the end of the war. Texas has been left powerless since the loss of war by the Confederacy. The state has seen a great influx of newcomers from the North who are in search for work or business opportunities in the South. Many Yankee merchants have set-up shop in Texas but many carpetbaggers and land-grabbers have also arrived in Texas. Since slavery has been abolished, many former slaves refuse to work the fields and some have already deserted their former owners and masters. All these things turned Lon's father, Temple Cordeen, into a bitter man bent on revenge.

Nowadays, Temple Cordeen, still dressed in his Confederate uniform, refuses to accept the war's outcome, the end of the slavery and the loss of his personal wealth.

In the castle can be seem complicated apparatus bubbling and flashing furiously...the laboratory of Professor Rasputin Von Rotten, a deranged scientist. The professor's obsession is to be recorded as the greatest name in history; he has invented a machine with which he will go back into time and change history, replacing such great names as Columbus, King Arthur and Buffalo Bill with the name Rasputin Von Rotten. As the professor sets feverishly to work the camera moves back into the clouds and there is a dissolve to title----Willy McBean and His Magic Machine---and credits.
The storm is still raging. A small town is seen. A monkey comes flying into the picture. He is blown onto a steeple and looks to a long shot of a house. In the house is Willy McBean, a boy of the space and jet age whose hobby is science, electronic devices and invention. He has been sent to his room to study his history lesson, not at all his favorite subject. Willy's attention is caught by a tapping on the window; he opens it to admit the monkey who identifies himself as Pablo. Pablo explains how he had been a prisoner of the mad professor and has escaped. He tells of the professor's intentions to change history and asks Willy to help build a duplicate Time machine from the plans he took during his escape. Willy, not wishing to re-learn all the history he has learned, agrees. The machine built, they go back into Time. Their first stop is Tombstone, Arizona where they meet Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull, who have come to town to present the famous ""Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull explain in music-and-song the ""new"" West --- singing a vaudeville-patter number called ""We've Got Show Biz.""

But, Willy and Pablo foil his scheme, and the professor, using his Time machine disappears. Willy and Pablo follow to...a dock in Spain. They meet an unemployed sailor named Christopher Columbus,, who tells them of his plan to sail to China, but he lacks money. He bemoans his sad situation in song with ""You Gotta Go East to Get West."" Willy suggests Queen Isabella for financing. She agrees and they set sail West to discover China and the Indies. The professor, appearing as a Chinese interpreter, plans to be history's greatest discoverer by creating a mutiny and taking over the ship. Willy and Pablo again foil him and he disappears as he is being made to walk the plank. Willy and Pablo use their magic Time machine to follow him to...the time of King Arthur. A host of Knights are happily wining, dining and singing ""Knights of the Round Table."" King Arthur, a puny little man, is very much worried that he might not be able to pull the sword, Excalibur, from the stone to claim his rightful title to the crown. Merlin sets forth to conjure up some magic for the occasion, in the midst of which Willy and Pablo appear. Merlin believes he has created a Genie. Meanwhile, a mysterious Black Knight shows up. It is Von Rotten who plnas to pull the sword himself and become the greatest King in history by replacing King Arthur. But Willy and Pablo give him another case of the Drats. The professor charts a course for Egypt and our heroes plan to follow but there is a dial misfunction and they finds themselves in a dark, dank dungeon-like cellar with caged animals. They escape it but the exit leads them to to Coliseum facing lions and tigers ready to devour them. Like Harry, they make a hairbreadth escape. Meanwhile, back in Egypt, the professor gets the job of consulting architect to help King Tut construct a monument to last for centuries. The professor has plans to replace the Sphinx with his own face. Willy and Pablo appear and the professor tells Tut they are spies and should be fed to the crocodiles. But, at that moment, the giant monumnet, designed by the professor, whose many skills did not include being an architect, crumbles and collapses. Von Rotten runs to the rubble as the King and Queen unhappily sing ""Two Tuts in a Rut."" Willya and Pablo explain to them how to stack the rubble to form a new monument. It becomes the first Pyramid. The trail left by Von Rotten is one that leads to the Age of The Cavemen. They find mist rising from the ground of a prehistoric land with wild animals and cave dwellers. The professor, to cement his stature as the world's greatest inventor, plans to come up with the Wheel and Fire. Willy and Pablo, while talking and singing (possibly the world's first song) with the locals, are interrupted by the most terrible monster of all time, the ""Big Big."" The cavemen throw rocks at it and, then, the professor's Time machine, apparently stranding Von Rotten in the Age of the Cavemen. Pablo, of Spanish descent as his name plainly shows (there was no political-incorrectness in The Age of the Cavemen) defeats ""Big Big"" toreador fashion, thereby setting the rules for bullfighting, albeit the size of the opponent scaled down over the centuries. Von Rotten repents and promises to reform and hitches a ride back to the 20th Century. There, Willy and Pablo discover the people around them are counterpart look-alikes of the people they encountered while traveling on Willy's Magic Machine. Willy also discovers that Professor Von Rotten has acquired the job of history teacher at his school. The story of ""Willy McBean and His Magic Machine"" ends on a note of suspicion that Raspution Von Rotten's motives are still suspect."

Cotolay,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059060/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The plot is loosely based on the legend from Galicia in north-west Spain of the founding by St Francis of Assisi (1182-1226) of the Convent of San Francisco near Santiago de Compostela in 1214 with the help of a poor charcoal burner named Cotolay, who found a buried treasure which paid for the construction. This slow moving but engaging film opens with St Francis arriving in Santiago with two other monks - Juan of Florence and Bernardo de Quintavalle - during a pilgrimage there to visit the tomb of St James the Apostle in the cathedral. He receives a divine revelation to tarry there until the meaning of his vision becomes clear. Faint with hunger he meets Cotolay (the 14-year-old Didier Haudepin) who gives the monks (stolen) figs to eat and leads them to the nearby Mount Pedroso where logging-master Tarna gives them food and lodging in return for work during their stay. While praying on the mountain St Francis believes he has been divinely instructed that his order of mendicant friars should found convents, starting at Santiago. Because St Francis is struck down with fever and blindness, Cotolay promises him that he will build it for him. Believing his grandfather's tales of buried treasure at a ruined abbey Cotolay vainly goes in search of it, until St Francis tells him that real treasure lies in one's self, in faith, humility and obedience; with these qualities one can build a whole world, not just a convent. With charm, piety, zeal and kindness Cotolay sets about his task, persuading the abbot of St Martin's Benedictine Monastery to grant a parcel of his land as large as a bull's skin in return for a basketful of fish. The abbot agrees but Cotolay cuts the skin into thin strips and marks out a far larger plot of land than expected in the Val de Dios (Valley of God). Next Cotolay gets the cathedral master mason Mateo to donate a pile of stones and has the loggers transport them to the chosen site in a competition of strength. After Mateo has constructed the convent St Francis is taken to the new building where his sight is restored. The film ends with St Francis taking his leave of a tearful Cotolay, who wants him to stay. (It should be noted that the version of the film with English subtitles is usually known as Cotolay, rather than by the original Spanish title of El Nino y El Lobo - The Boy and the Wolf.) The wolf of the Spanish title plays only a very minor part in the story and is eventually tamed by St Francis."

The manufactured, unambiguously humorless profundity proffered up by other German contemporaries is absent here. Laughter is allowed. Kristl takes the dreadful liberty of tomfoolery, sending up himself, the characters, the action, ""tragedy,"" and everything else, including the audience, that might be held sacred. Within the framework of the action, we recognize a love triangle, one of the simplest of dramatic configurations. Not only the basic idea, but also numerous particulars, both in subject and style, are reminiscent of the films of Roman Polanski, which Kristl doubtless saw and holds in esteem. We meet two men: one is meant to embody the outsider, the artistic, intellectual, individualist. The other looks like the embodiment of the well-to-do man, the burgher, the functionary, the capitalist. The two battle for the favor of an indecisive and domineering girl."

Dr Thomas and his wife plead with the captain to allow the crew some recreation time. He responds by ordering all the capsules brought to his cabin so he can keep control of them.Steven Thomas goes to the control room to check Dr Garth. He is happy in a melancholy way. Saunders asked Garth if he knows of any plans given to Ralston for the coming year. Dr Garth admits he could not answer even if he wanted to.The Thomas's are checking on the crew in suspended animation when Helen suddenly feels faint. Her husband asked what the results of the last tests were, and she admits she never took the exam. Steven decides he needs to get that rectified immediatelyThe Saunders talk over the events of the night and Ralston's behaviour. Kate is disgruntled and tries to goad her husband into a fight. The next morning during breakfast tension is running very high; the bland algae diet is getting one everyone's nerves. Kate defends herself, saying she has very limited resources with which to work. Saunders brings up the question of what is to happen during the second year regarding children. Ralston becomes defensive and tells the crew he will tell them what concerns them.Ralston sends Helen to find Steve, he wants a meeting. In the lab Steve is going over Helen's results and it is not good news. It appears Helen has a pancreatic infection, and the prognosis is not good. As a doctor she understands the seriousness of the situation.Steven believes the only way to save Helen is to return to Earth, she argues Ralston will never agree to the return. Steven approaches the crew explains the situation. Ralston immediately rejects the option, claiming he has no choice.Steven reports back to Helen that Ralston reacted exactly how she expected. He wants to force Ralston to turn around, but Helen argues otherwise. The future of their son is at stake. She wants the chance for the boy to have a new future.Steven arranges a grievance committee to see how much support he may have among the balance of the crew. Jan puts together a lesson plan for the children, of which her husband disapproves. She is concerned her husband is spying on her and reviewing all the information being taught to the kids. In particular, she is bothered by the style of government and organization, called RULE, introduced. Mead admits he is a member of the organization and has been before the couple married.Mrs. Ralston criticizes her husband for having changed. She says the rest of the crew has also seen the change and dislikes itSteven and Helen talk about the future; at best she has three years. Steven still wants to return but Helen argues against it. Better to have three good years than to be stuck on an overcrowded, over-controlled Earth. She does tell him she wants to have a little sister for her son. She does not want to ask Ralston, simply do it and let him deal with the future.Ralston contacts the couple, admonishes Steven for not being at his post, then requests a meeting with Helen. At the meeting Ralston speaks of the regrets he has for Helen. He then warns Helen that Steven needs to tone down his attitude and questions Steven has about the Captain. She then asks the Ralston for permission to have a second child. Ralston tells her it is not his choice; the mission profile does not allow her a second child and he is going to stand by that. Steven speaks with Saunders about the growing friction with Ralston. Saunders explains he is very frustrated with the situation and wants to do something.Later, Steven goes to get Helen for dinner. She is dead in bed, leaving a suicide note explaining that Ralston refusing to allow a child was more than she can take. Steven finds Ralston and challenges him over his behaviour and knocks him out. With the help of Saunders, they take him to his cabin and lock him inside. Effectively they have staged a mutiny. Finally, Saunders shows Stevens the special key to set off a self-destruct sequence to destroy the ship.Later, Ralston discusses the situation with his wife, according to the regulations he only has one course of action, to execute Thomas.In their cabin, the Saunders discusses the situation. John speaks to his wife about his involvement in putting Ralston in restraints, he does not feel like a hero, and is worried that he cannot justify his actions. Trying to stay practical, his wife discusses what will happen regarding the funeral. John tells her the regulations say she will be buried in space.Saunders leads the funeral service in the absence of the captain. Everyone is deeply distressed as Helen's body is ejected from the ship. Later the Saunders and Thomas call a meeting to elect a new captain. Steven Thomas is the only nomination.He expresses regret over what occurred on the ship, and really does not want the nomination unless the crew gives him their full support and continues to do their jobs as before. All agree apart from Karl, who still supports the captain, but realizes he is in the minority.On Earth we see Captain Burnett dictating a memo to the RULE council. He advises the council that he has lost contact with the spacecraft, and if contact is not re-established within 2 days the ship will be presumed lost.Steven talks to Garth about the situation. Should he tell them about the coup or press on in total silence. Steven tells Garth that he's explained the orders for year two, and the crew can try and have children.Later, Saunders confides in Steve that Kate is pregnant. Joyce interrupts the news to tell Steven she and Karl have had another argument. Steven thinks the source of her problems are caused by the continuing situation with the Captain, Joyce tells him she's never really loved Karl and the problems date long before the mission beganSteven finds Jan and asks for her help about what to do with the captain. He asks Jan to try and talk to the captain to see if some resolution can be found. Jan warns Steven that if the captain gets out, he is going to kill Steven because the captain believes Steven's actions were mutiny. Steven assures her everything will be fineKarl finds the keys to unlock the room the captain is in and releases him before he can correct the situation. Ralston jumps him from behind and knocks him out, retaking command of the ship. The captain tells the crew they will be locked in their rooms until further notice.He then tells Steven about his execution. Before he does, he orders Thomas to awaken Dr Griffiths so that there is a medical person after Thomas is executed.Jan Ralston talks to Garth about the location of weapons on-board. Garth tells her they are stored with the rest of the survival gear needed once the ship reaches Earth 2. He cautions the weapons are inaccessible until the ship lands.Thomas approaches Ralston again pleading not to awaken Griffiths, Steven argues conditions are too unstable and he can't guarantee the results. Ralston warns Thomas, any treachery will cause him to set off the self-destruct system on the shipSteven goes to his quarters and finds Kate. She asks Steven pointedly does he think the captain is insane. Steven doesn't think so, he believes Ralston is simply suffering the pressure of command. Steven begins to process of waking Dr Griffiths, it will take at least 18 hours to warm him enough to begin revival.Karl speaks to Thomas and apologizes for siding with the Captain, he did not think Ralston would go through with his plan to execute Steven after he got free. Steven dismisses the apology and tells Karl he is not his consciousBack in the medical area, Dr Griffiths (Tony Doonan) breaks free of his container. He seems disorientated and unsure of his surroundings. He leaves the medical bay and begins exploring the ship. He comes across Kate asleep in the nursery and knocks her out. Ralston thinks he hears something and goes to investigate. Ralston finds Griffiths. In his confused state, Griffiths kills him immediately.Karl discovers what has happened and slugs Griffiths, knocking him out. Thomas arrives on the scene and checks to see if the captain may still be alive. Karl and Steven take Griffith back to the medical bay, but he dies.Steven explains it was the temperature differential that caused Griffith to fall apart from the inside.At the funeral for the two men, Steven and Kate quietly hold hands during the service, the inference being they may be starting a relationship"

The Rabbit Is Me,1965,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059347/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Rabbit Is Me was made in 1965 to encourage discussion of the democratization of East German society. In it, a young student has an affair with a judge who once sentenced her brother for political reasons; she eventually confronts him with his opportunism and hypocrisy. It is a sardonic portrayal of the German Democratic Republic's judicial system and its social implications. The film was banned by officials as an anti-socialist, pessimistic and revisionist attack on the state. It henceforth lent its name to all the banned films of 1965, which became known as the ""Rabbit Films."" After its release in 1990, The Rabbit Is Me earned critical praise as one of the most important and courageous works ever made in East Germany. It was screened at The Museum of Modern Art in 2005 as part of the film series Rebels with a Cause: The Cinema of East Germany.—DEFA Film Library Maria Morzcek (Angelika Waller) lives in East Germany with her Aunt Hete (Ilse Voigt). Maria narrates a lot of the story. Recently, her brother, Dieter (Wolfgang Winkler), has been jailed for three years for subversive behavior and she's been seduced by her gym teacher at school. The school principal tries to get her to condemn her brother's behavior. She refuses. After finishing school she is rejected by the university she applied to enter and becomes a waitress. By chance, at a concert, she meets the judge responsible for her brother's sentencing. He is attracted to her and pursues her until they become lovers. At first she had no idea who he was but during a visit to her brother, Dieter, in prison she learned the name of the judge was Paul Deister (Alfred Müller).He is pleasant middle-aged man who courts her and wins her affection and they begin an affair. When she is diagnosed with Spondylitis, requiring six months rest in a warm climate, he offers her the unrestricted use of his holiday home. He visits her on Sundays and Mondays and they make love. He also asks her to do some translations of Russian files he is working on, which he pays her for, making her feel more like his equal. She also gets a job as a waitress in a local bar. She tries to petition the court for Dieter to be pardoned but she recognizes it is beyond her capabilities and knowledge.Deister learns of the connection between them and is furious, thinking she is trying to manipulate him, when it is has been quite the reverse. A wedge begins to separate them. Despite everything, they are in love, and the relationship survives a few months of building tension and frustration. In the town where Maria now lives, a man's body is found in the lake. One of the searchers, Grambow (Rudolf Ulrich), in a drunken moment, denounces the German Democratic Republic when he reveals in a public bar that the dead man was a non-commissioned officer. He compares the importance of a commissioned officer with the dead man and denounces the elitist attitude towards working class people, who were the people who enlisted and earned their rank, and those who feel entitled. Deister witnesses the situation and defuses. As a hard-liner he believes it requires the full penalty the law can adjudicate. The local Mayor (Helmut Schellhardt) tries to reason with Deister about the level at which the offense should be regarded.A local court is convened and evidence is heard, including testimony from Maria, but she and the town refuse to condemn Grambow. He is let off with a suspended sentence of 90-days compared with the three-years that Dieter received for a similar offense. This leniency incenses Maria and causes the divide, between Paul's beliefs and her experience, to widen.One day a car pulls up at the house in the country. She expects Paul but it is Deister's wife, Gabriele (Irma Münch). She's quite restrained in her manner as she meets the 19-year old mistress, and Maria learns that Judge Deister tried to commit suicide recently, but failed. It appears that the relationship is over until Deister runs into Maria again and attempts to win her back by showing that he has listened to what she has said to him and changed. He tells her, ""A new wind is blowing."" He's willing to write to the court regarding Dieter, to get him an early release. Maria realizes that he's actually looking to service his own career yet again by going with the popular belief, of a judicial system that should now show more compassion and be more lenient in sentencing. She tears his letter up and ends the relationship.When Dieter is released from prison he learns that Maria had an affair with the judge who sentenced him. He beats her. She recovers from the beating and resolves to move out of her Aunt's flat and make her own way in the world. She will work as a waitress as long as she needs to. Rejected from studying at a university she will try to be responsible for her own progress, using her Russian-language skills to get a position as an interpreter. She is wiser and a more mature nineteen-year old than less than a year before. There's a determination in every step she takes to show she will make something of herself and stand up for herself. She won't be pushed around anymore, by Deiter or Diester, or anyone."

The Smurfs live in a village of big mushroom houses in a forest land.-In ""Le Voleur de Schtroumpfs"" (""The Smurf Thief""), a Smurf is caught by the evil sorcerer Gargamel, who wants to capture Smurfs, because they are an ingredient in the formula for the famed Philosopher's Stone, which Gargamel wants to recreate and use to make gold.

And he can turn other Smurfs like this by simply biting them on their tails, and a zombie-like plague starts. Papa Smurf, who witnessed an incident like this in his younger years, works fast to find a cure... (This story is based on the very first story in the Smurfs' own comic-book series.)-In ""Le Schtroumpf et son Dragon"" (""The Smurfs and the Dragon""), the Smurfs befriend a tame dragon.-In the last segment, ""Le Schtroumpf Volant"" (""The Flying Smurf""), a Smurf dreams of flying like a bird, and attempts to do so in various ways, from feather wings to a hot-air balloon."

Afterwards they become big shots in the States but their dream comes to an end : they are sent to fight in Vietnam—Salvatore Santangelo <pappagone2@libero.it> Franco and Ciccio Impallomeni (Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia) are two Sicilian street entertainers who find it hard to make money among the peasant workers of their home town. So, they decide to emigrate to America hoping to make their fortune. After stowing away on the wrong boat, they find themselves in an immigration camp in New Quiracio, the capital city of the Republic of Santa Prisca, a South American country under the control of a brutal dictator named General Jose Limar (Roberto Camardiel). Franco and Ciccio swiftly make enemies of the military controllers of the camp who can't wait to get rid of them.General Limar's regime is supported by to some extent by the USA, which has business interests in the region. At the same time, Santa Prisca is currently embroiled in a bitter civil war: guerrilla attacks are being mounted by rebels (""baffudos"") and rebel women (""sbarbados"") who are operating from hidden training camps in the countryside. Limar wants American military support, but a US ambassador (Umberto D'Orsi) sent to the region declares that American troops will only attack the rebels if they are being attacked first. General Limar arranges a subterfuge to inveigle the Americans into helping him: two prisoners will be taken from the immigration camp, disguised as American paratroopers, and dropped behind enemy lines into a rebel encampment. When the ""baffudos"" kill or abuse them, it will coax the Americans into retaliation. To this end, Franco and Ciccio are dressed up and parachuted into the rebel camp where they are immediately captured.Alvardo Garcia (Luis Pena) the rebel officer in charge of the camp and the rebel unit staying there, orders the immediate execution of the two paras by hanging, but after the intervention of a gang of female rebels, Franco and Ciccio are saved.

Realizing that the two Italian-speaking idiots are part of a plan to inflame American feeling, the rebels mount an attack on the town where the immigration camp is located, but the US ambassador has already sent American paratroopers into the area. A gun battle breaks out between the rebels and Americans: Garcia sends Franco and Ciccio to explain to the US soldiers, but instead get themselves ""rescued"".Back at the American military base, Colonel Smith (Emilio Rodriguez), the American officer in charge of the US brigade of paratroopers, realizes that Franco and Ciccio are not Americans because they have no dog-tags, and quickly puts them in the custody of General Limar, who quizzes them for information about the rebels, but they refuse to talk. Before General Limar can torture Franco and Ciccio for answers, the interrogation is terminated when rebels burst in, led by Garcia. They overpower Limar and stage a coup.Garcia swiftly proves as power-mad and ruthless as his predecessor and series of counter-revolution and counter-counter-revolutions follow all over Santa Prisca. When the US ambassador (now safely back in Washington DC), sends Americans troops to restore General Lima to power, a mix-up results in Franco and CIccio being anointed as the new rulers of Santa Prisca. Finally after much foolishness, the rebel women, lead by Consuelo (Linda Sini) take control and impose an all-female dictatorship.Seeing that the situation is getting out of control, Franco and Ciccio decide to leave the country and head for America.
