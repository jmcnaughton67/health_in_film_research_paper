A Man for All Seasons,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060665/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of Sir Thomas More, who stood up to King Henry VIII when the King rejected the Roman Catholic Church to obtain a divorce and remarry. The story takes place in sixteenth century England. But men like Sir Thomas More, who love life yet have the moral fiber to lay down their lives for their principles, are found in every century. Concentrating on the last seven years of the English Chancellor's life, the struggle between More and King Henry VIII hinges on Henry's determination to break with Rome so he can divorce his current wife and wed again, and good Catholic More's inability to go along with such heresy. More resigns as Chancellor, hoping to be able to live out his life as a private citizen. But Henry will settle for nothing less than that the much respected More give public approval to his headstrong course.—alfiehitchie King Henry VIII's desire for a son and heir leads him to seek a divorce from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne Boleyn. He had already received a dispensation from the Pope to marry Catherine, she was his brother's widow, and he seeks the support of Sir Thomas More, who is soon named Chancellor. More is a devout Catholic, and while he does not agree with the King's desire to divorce, he is completely silent in his opposition. His principles are tested, however, when he also remains silent after the King is named the head of the Church of England, and subsequently when Parliament requires all to take an oath of allegiance. His silence is not sufficient for the King, who wishes to have More's public endorsement. He is eventually brought to trial on charges of having accepted a bribe, but it is one of his former supporters, Sir Richard Rich, who perjures himself leading to More being found guilty and beheaded.—garykmcd The life of Sir Thomas More during the period of his service in various capacities to volatile King Henry VIII is presented. More, a lawyer and devoted member of the Catholic Church, and the King are often at odds with each other, the King nonetheless wanting More's blessing on matters as a moral and principled person. The biggest bone of contention is the King wanting More to wield his influence with the church to permit him to divorce Catherine of Aragon - who is unable to bore him children, meaning no male heir to the throne - so that he can marry Anne Boleyn. More is unwilling to do so, seeing it an act against his faith to the church. With the help of an ambitious, opportunistic and somewhat feckless young man named Richard Rich who More considers a friend, Thomas Cromwell, one of More's primary adversaries, plans to exploit the rift between the King and More to his own benefit for greater power within the court. The ultimate questions become how far the King will go to get what he wants, and how much More is willing to risk to remain true to his principles.—Huggo When the highly respected British statesman Sir Thomas More refuses to pressure the Pope into annulling the marriage of King Henry VIII and his Spanish-born wife, More's clashes with the monarch increase in intensity. A devout Catholic, More stands by his religious principles and moves to leave the royal court. Unfortunately, the King and his loyalists aren't appeased by this, and press forward with grave charges of treason, further testing More's resolve.—Jwelch5742 Thomas More (Paul Scofield) is at odds with Henry VIII (Robert shaw) over the king's wish to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, so that he may marry Anne Boleyn. More understands that from the standpoint of the Roman Catholic church, the king would be heretical.More, the appointed Lord Chancellor, is so highly regarded that his outspoken unwillingness to break with Rome makes Henry VIII look unreasonable and the king is furious. As the king's wrath grows, he tries to discredit More by attempts at legal trickery, but the attempts fail. More feels the heat being turned up and determines it best to resign his post to retire to private life. Unfortunately, because More's resignation speaks so loudly of the king's intended impropriety, the king will still settle for no less than More's approval of the divorce. More, however, refuses to relent.Henry now has legislation passed that establishes himself as having supreme power in English religious affairs, breaking with Rome and, thereby, establishing the Church of England. He then has legislation passed establishing it as treasonous for any member of the king's court to refuse to sign off on it. More's refusal to sign off dooms him to be beheaded, but he will be remembered as a deeply principled ""man for all seasons."""

Men are sent for a boat, but many villagers go into a tizzy, risking bloodshed. In the Cold War, when the captain of a Russian submarine comes too close to the Gloucester Island in Massachusetts to give a look at America, the submarine gets stranded. A nine-man team commanded by Lieutenant Rozanov goes onshore to search a motor boat to release the submarine and arrives at the summer house of the New Yorker writer Walt Whittaker that is spending the weekend with his family in Gloucester. When he realizes that they are Russians, he believes that it is an invasion.

He sends his two English speaking crewmen to procure a boat with enough power to pull them off. The 2 English speakers, along with 7 other Russian sailors, don't exactly blend in and the town is convinced that they are being invaded.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The Soviet naval submarine Sprut (which means ""octopus"" or ""kraken"" in Russian) draws too close to the New England coast when its captain wants to take a good look at America and runs aground on a sandbar near an island off Cape Cod. Rather than radio in for help and risk an embarrassing international incident, the captain (Theodore Bikel) sends a nine-man landing party headed by his second-in-command Lieutenant Rozanov (Alan Arkin) to find a motor launch to help free the sub from the bar. The men arrive at the house of Walt Whittaker (Carl Reiner), a vacationing playwright from New York City. Whittaker is eager to get his wife Elspeth (Eva Marie Saint) and two children, obnoxious six-year-old Pete (Sheldon Collins) and three-year-old Annie (Cindy Putnam), off the island now that summer is over.Failing to convince the Whittakers that his group are Norwegians (all of the Russians are conspicuously dressed in sinister all-black clothing), Rozanov draws a gun and promises no harm if the family provides information about military on the island (none) and police force (small), and gives them the keys to their car. Walt and Elspeth provide the answers and the keys, and the Russians depart, leaving behind a young sailor, Alexei Kolchin (John Phillip Law), to guard the Whittakers and, subsequently, their attractive 18-year-old neighbor and babysitter, named Alison Palmer (Andrea Dromm) when she stumbles upon them.The Whittakers' station wagon quickly runs out of gasoline on a rural coastal road, forcing the Russians to walk. They make it to another group of houses where they steal an old sedan from Muriel Everett (Doro Merande), the postmistress; she calls Alice Foss (Tessie O'Shea), the gossipy telephone switchboard operator, and before long, wild rumors throw the entire island into confusion. As level-headed Police Chief Link Mattocks (Brian Keith) and his bumbling assistant Norman Jonas (Jonathan Winters) try to squelch the inept vigilante movement of blustering Fendall Hawkins (Paul Ford).Meanwhile, Walt and Elspeth manage to overpower Kolchin, who flees, but when Walt and Elspeth along with Pete leave the house to find help, Kolchin returns and takes Alison and Annie hostage.Trying to find the Russians on his own, Walt is re-captured by them. After subduing Mrs. Foss and disabling the island's telephone switchboard, seven of the Russians manage to steal a motorboat and head back to their sub, which is still high and dry. Back at the Whittaker house, Kolchin is by now falling in love with Alison. Walt manages to free himself, and he and Elspeth return to the house and almost shoot Rozanov who arrives there just after they do. With the misunderstandings cleared up, the Whittakers, Rozanov and Kolchin decide to head into town together to clear the air with everyone over just what is going on.With the rising tide, the Sprut frees itself, and the Russian captain sets out in search of his missing men. He finds Rozanov and Kolchin in the harbor and threatens to blow up the town unless the other seven are returned to him. Chief Mattocks arrives with the rest of the armed villagers who threaten action against the sub's crew on deck with rifles and pistols. As tension mounts, a small boy (Johnny Whitaker) falls from his perch on the church steeple and hangs perilously from a gutter. Forgetting their differences, islanders and Russians unite to form a human pyramid and rescue the child.With peace and harmony established, the Sprut heads out of the harbor with a convoy of villagers in small boats protecting it. The boat with the seven Russians reaches the group shortly thereafter, and the seven board the submarine, just before two U.S. Air Force F-101B Voodoo jets arrive. They break off after seeing the convoy, and the Sprut is free to sail away to safe waters."

Over seven periods in his life, spanning 1400 to 1424, we see the history of Russia, the power struggles, the role of the church and religion and Rublev's dedication to his calling.—grantss The narrative film, divided into eight short stories, describes the period of turmoil in Russia at the beginning of the 15th century - from 1400 to 1423, as if seen through the eyes of the icon-monk Andrey Rublev. Separate short stories are little connected with each other, but they paint a general picture of medieval Russia, taking shape like a mosaic. The first small chapter shows the flight of a monk in a balloon. The main plot of the film is the departure of three monks from Andronikov Monastery: Daniil, Cyril and Andrey Rublev.—Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) Director Andrei Tarkovsky shows the beautiful icons created by this famous iconographer only at the end of this long, long film. He shows that they were not just painted by a contemplative monk in a peaceful monastery. They were painted in the midst of the bustling life and terrible cruelty of medieval Russia, a land of ignorant peasants, cruel princes and Tartars invading thrice a year.Part I (86 mins.)Chapter 1
Hot-Air BalloonChapter 2
The Buffoon, 1400 AD.
The opening image is of three monks who set off for Moscow across a harvested field: Kirill, Andrei and Danila. They take shelter from a rainstorm in a barn/inn. There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3
Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD.
This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel.
An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him.
Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand.
Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4
The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma. Andrei tells him, ""I washed brushes for three years for Danila before he trusted me with an icon. And then only to clean it, not to create one"". He and Foma meet Theophanes the Greek, who despairs of his countrymen:
""The day of judgement is coming. We will all burn like candles!""
Andrei replies, ""I don't understand how you can paint, with such opinions. If I thought like this, I would have vowed silence and gone to live in a cave.""
Theophanes: ""All is vanity! All is useless! Humanity has already committed all stupidities, and is starting to repeat them.""
Andrei replies with a meditation on the suffering of the Russian people, illustrated by the passion of Father Kirill.Chapter 5
Pagan Feast, 1408 AD.This is a Midsummer festival, where the monks observe naked peasants running through the forest carrying flaming torches, or standing in the river, holding the torches high and paying homage to the image of their deity, floating downriver in a little boat.Chapter 6 Last Judgement, 1408 AD
Andrei is unable to paint the Last Judgement on the whitewashed walls of a new church, because he doesnt want to scare the people.Part II (99 mins.)Chapter 1
Raid on the city of Vladimir, 1408 AD.
To revenge himself on his brother, the Grand Prince, the younger brother (the Little Prince) leads a band of Tartars into the city of Vladimir.
They break down the door of the cathedral, where the people have taken refuge. They torture, murder and rape the people, and set fire to the building. The Tartars climb to the roof and plunder the gold leaf from the dome. The Little Prince looks on grimly. Only Andrei and a halfwit, dumb girl, Durochka, survive. Before the burned-out iconostasis, in the cathedral filled with corpses, with the ghost of Theophanes as his witness, he vows silence.Chapter 2
The Silence, 1412 AD
Famine ravages the countryside, and a haggard Father Kirill returns, begging to be taken back into the monastery.Chapter 3
The Bell, 1423 AD
A teenaged lad, Boris, tells some soldiers, who are looking for a bell-founder, ""My father is dead of the plague, so are my mother and sister. But my father told me the secret of the bell before he died. I have the secret of bell bronze"".
He is taken to cast a new bell for the Grand Prince of Vladimir.
Andrei is a silent observer of the trials of the bell casting. At one point, he is confronted by Father Kirill:
""You know why I left the monastery? I envied your talent. Envy was eating out my soul. I left because of you. And look at you now! You are wasting your talent. It is a sin to waste your God-given talent!""
After the first ringing of the bell, Boris, begins to weep, crying that his father did not give him the secret of the bell.
Andrei comforts him, ""Dont cry! You will go on to cast many bells, and I will go on to paint icons"".At this point, the film suddenly switches to colour, and we are shown Rublev's icons in loving detail."

The Battle of Algiers,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058946/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the 1950s, fear and violence escalate as the people of Algiers fight for independence from the French government. A film commissioned by the Algerian government that shows the Algerian revolution from both sides. The French foreign legion has left Vietnam in defeat and has something to prove. The Algerians are seeking independence. The two clash. The torture used by the French is contrasted with the Algerian's use of bombs in soda shops. A look at war as a nasty thing that harms and sullies everyone who participates in it.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In 1954, the National Liberation Front of Algiers shots many French policemen beginning a movement for the independence of their country; in return, the Chief of Police plants a bomb in the Arab quarter, killing many dwellers. The NLF sends three women with bombs to two bars and the Air France office in the European quarter, killing many people. The French government sends the military forces under the command of the abusive Colonel Mathieu that does not respect the human rights and uses torture to destroy the NLF command. In 1962, the Algerians finally achieve their aimed independence.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1954. France, after the independence of the nations comprising Indochina, turns its attention to incidents in French Algeria, which they have ruled for approximately one hundred thirty years. The National Liberation Front (FLN) is leading the resistance in Algeria against their colonial rulers, the FLN who the French authorities believe, or want to believe, comprise only a small minority of the Muslim Algerian population in wanting Algerian independence. Specific incidents in this battle in Algiers between 1954 and the time of independence in 1962 are presented. The FLN began their campaign in shooting military police in the Casbah, the predominantly Muslim quarter of the city, as they were able to blend back into the scene with the support of the populace. These initial one by one attacks escalated on both sides to mass killings, where collateral damage was seen as being acceptable. Both sides also worked toward the United Nations discussion on the issue, each wanting global support for their cause. The events largely focus on two people, one on each side. The first is Ali La Pointe, a lifelong petty criminal and illiterate who the FLN recruited after being politicized while in prison. The second is French paratrooper Colonel Mathieu, a lead French strategist whose main goal is to dismantle the FLN activities by ""cutting off the head of the tapeworm"".—Huggo Filmed in a semi-documentary format, this film deals with the battle of Algiers (1956-57) part of the broader fight for Algerian independence (1954-62) from French colonial rule. The rebels began their attacks by shooting policeman and other government officials. When they start bombing public places in the European sector - cafés, restaurants, the Air France office - the authorities send in crack military units. Through large-scale arrests and torture, the colonel in charge focuses on locating and eliminating the leaders of the movement.—garykmcd The opening scene is of a man who has presumably been tortured by some French military personnel. The commander (Col. Mathieu played by Jean Martin) enters and tells the man to put on a French uniform. The man sheds a tear. He is obviously being forced into something he doesnt want to do. In the next scene you have the commander again speaking to some young men who are hidden in a wall. Ali is obviously going to be a main character. We see him running through the streets. Some French young men trip him. Ali is a bit of a hot head and smashes the French boys face.We see a man in a prison being beheaded with the guillotine. Ali witnesses this.Cut to Ali (played by Brahim Hadjadj) being approached by a young boy with a note. He is given instructions on how to carry out a terrorist plot. He is tricked into shooting a French officer but the gun was empty. He meets one of the leaders of the resistance movement, the Jaffar. In the next scene a drunken man is beaten by a bunch of little kids.In the next scene Ali shoots a middle-aged man.A FLN wedding is performed. The French put them in charge of civic affairs but it seemed like a religious wedding.Ali appears to be among a group of young men who infiltrate the police headquarters and kill several police personnel. This is only the beginning of a series of attacks against the police. There are casualties on both sides.The women use their outward signs of piety (burkas) to hide weapons. A group of women dress up like western women. Bombs are distributed. The women go into the French sectoran area that looks as though it may have been pulled out of Paris with fashionably dressed people, sidewalk cafés and people enjoying their leisure time.The French respond to all of the Terrorist activities with a show of force. For a moment the commandant looks like an Amway salesman describing what is exactly like a multilevel marketing scheme in his explanation of a terrorist cell. The FLN is ordered to strike but the French have a hidden agenda to find out whom the resistance fighters might be. The French captain is very cleaver to know that the insurrection would come after the terrorist bombings.Another bombing at a crowded horse race: Some of the French adults attack an Algerian child.There are two scenes with reporters asking questions. In the first one a high-level resistance fighter is questioned. In the second, the captain is confronted with some difficult questions. One of the things they are asked about is if they use torture. The captain answers in a diplomatic manner and then the audience sees several acts of brutal torture with the Algerians as the victims.In the closing scene we see the captain negotiating with the resistance fighters who want a written promise that they will have a fair trial if they surrender. The fighters ask him to send it up in a basket. The resistance fighters send a basket containing a bomb. It explodes killing or injuring at least one soldier. Jaffar is captured but Ali is still at large.The closing scene shows Ali with his friends. They hear soldiers coming and all but the woman hide in the wall-hiding place. The French soldiers plant a bomb outside the hiding place. We saw this scene before at the beginning of the movie. Apparently the Algerian we saw in the opening scene who shed a tear led the French to Ali. The bomb explodes.The final scene takes place some time later in 1960. There is a riot going on with soldiers shooting into the crowds. The film ends with the captain narrating that on July 2, 1962 a new nation of Algeria was born."
Au hasard Balthazar,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060138/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of a mistreated donkey and the people around him. A study on saintliness and a sister piece to Bresson's Mouchette. This is the story of a donkey and the somewhat difficult life it leads. During a summer holiday, the baby donkey is a child's pet but when they return home, it begins it's life of misery. It works as a farm animal, pulling a delivery cart and working as any manner as various owners require of it. Meanwhile, the young girl who first acquired Balthazar as a pet grows up, only to be badly treated herself by an indifferent and selfish boyfriend.—garykmcd Film follows the life of the donkey Balthazar as he passes from owner to owner, many of them treating him cruelly, all of them are beyond his pure and simple comprehension. His sad predicament as a beast of burden parallels the life of his first human owner, Marie, who, like Balthazar suffers the sins of man. Balthazar is a noble creature, however, and he accepts his fate with grace. The film is a parable of virtue & purity. It is a narrative of transcendence in a life of burden.—SindyMac . In the French countryside near the Pyrenees, a baby donkey is adopted by young children - Jacques and his sisters, who live on a farm. They baptize the donkey (and christen it Balthazar) along with Marie, Jacques' childhood sweetheart, whose father is the teacher at the small school next-door.
. When one of Jacques' sisters dies, his family vacates the farm, and Marie's family take it over in a loose arrangement. The donkey is given away to local farmhands who work it very hard.
. Years pass until Balthazar is involved in an accident and runs off, finding its way back to Marie, who is now a teenager. But her father gets involved in legal wrangles over the farm and the donkey is given away to a local bakery for delivery work.
. Gerard, leader of a young criminal gang, is the delivery boy at the bakery, and so takes charge of the donkey, treating it cruelly.
. Marie, driving a 2CV one day, sees the donkey at the roadside and stops to greet it. Gerard, who'd been sleeping nearby, gets into her car. He rapes her (it's implied although we don't see it), and then she drives home. Marie later enters into an abusive relationship with him, leaving her parents.
. Gerard is summonsed to the local police station and questioned about a murder, along with Arnold, an alcoholic who is also a suspect. Neither are arrested. Balthazar becomes ill, and Arnold takes the donkey off Gerard's hands.
. Balthazar recovers and Arnold uses the donkey and another to guide tourists around the Pyrenees. When the season ends, Balthazar escapes and joins a circus. But when the donkey sees Arnold in the audience it goes berserk, and Arnold retrieves it.
. Arnold's uncle dies and he inherits a fortune. He throws a wild party at a bar, and then is put on Balthazar's back to ride home. However, he is so drunk he falls off, hits his head on the ground and dies. The police send Balthazar to market.
. A local miller buys the donkey, using it for pumping water and milling. One rainy night, Marie, soaking wet, knocks on the miller's door asking for shelter - she has run away from Gerard. The miller says he'll be her friend and help her to 'escape' - but next morning sees her parents and offers them the donkey, the inference being that Marie will follow.
. Marie goes back to her parents. Jacques visits, wanting to marry her and also saying his father does not want the money the court ordered Marie's father to pay him. But Marie is not sure she wants to marry Jacques. She says she wants to 'have it out' with Gerard and goes to visit a barn where they used to meet.
. Gerard is there with his gang, and they strip her, beat her and rape her, then lock her in (again this is not shown, but we see her naked and crying, as the gang run off throwing her clothes in the air).
. Marie's father and Jacques find her and break a window to get in. They take her home, pulled in a cart by Balthazar.
. Later Jacques wants to see Marie, but her mother comes downstairs and says 'she's gone and will never come back'. Marie's father dies shortly after, when visited by a priest.
. While Marie's mother is grieving, Gerard turns up with his gang and asks if he can borrow Balthazar. Ostensibly it's for a procession, but they use the donkey to carry contraband for smuggling over the border.
. At night, when Gerard and accomplice are supposed to be meeting their contact, they are instead shot at and they flee. Balthazar runs off and hides in bushes.
. In the morning, we see Balthazar has a gunshot wound. A shepherd and flock comes. The sheep gather around Balthazar, their bells jangling, as he lays down and dies."

Squelching across a God-forsaken ghost town near the US/Mexican border, always dragging a heavy coffin, blue-eyed Django, a drifting, mud-spattered, former Union soldier, saves runaway María from certain death. But, the wooden container with the mysterious content has already caught the attention of the racist ex-Confederate officer, Major Jackson, and his gang of white supremacists, and before long, things get nasty. Now, the guns have the final say, and as if that weren't enough, Jackson's sworn enemy, General Hugo Rodríguez, and his feared revolutionaries, enter the picture, wanting to have a piece of the action.

That cowboy is Django, and he arrives in a muddy ghost town ravaged by those bandits, where only the saloon and the brothel, owned by Nataniele, are open. Soon, Major Jackson, who charges protection fees from the dwellers, rounds his gang up to face Django. Then a mercenary and acquaintance of Django, Gen. Hugo Rodriguez, arrives in town, and Django proposes a bold plan to steal the gold from Jackson and split between them.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On the Mexico-United States border 100 years ago in the year 1866, a drifter (Franco Nero), wearing a Union army uniform and dragging a coffin, witnesses Mexican bandits tying a runaway prostitute, María (Loredana Nusciak), to a bridge and whipping her. The bandits are dispatched by henchmen of Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo) - a racist ex-Confederate officer - who prepare to kill María by crucifying her atop a burning cross. The drifter, who identifies himself as Django, easily shoots the men, and offers María protection. The pair arrive in a ghost town, populated by Nathaniel (Angel Alvarez), a bartender, and five prostitutes. Nathaniel explains that the town is a neutral zone in a conflict between Jackson's Red Shirts and General Hugo Rodríguez's (José Bodalo) revolutionaries.Jackson and his men arrive at the saloon to extract protection money from Nathaniel.

While helping Nathaniel bury the corpses, Django visits the grave of Mercedes Zaro, his former lover who was killed by Jackson.Hugo and his revolutionaries arrive and capture Jackson's spy, Brother Jonathan. As punishment, Hugo cuts off Jonathan's ear, forces him to eat it, and shoots him in the back. Later, Django proposes to Hugo, who he had once saved in prison, that they steal Jackson's gold, currently lodged in the Mexican Army's Fort Charriba on the other side of the border.Nathaniel, under the guise of bringing prostitutes for the soldiers, drives a horse cart containing Django, Hugo and four revolutionaries, two of whom are named Miguel and Ricardo, into the fort, allowing them to massacre many of the soldiers; Miguel uses Django's machine gun, while Django, Hugo and Ricardo fight their way to the gold. As Django and the revolutionaries escape, Jackson gives chase, but is forced to stop when the thieves reach American territory.

Persona,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060827/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A nurse is put in charge of a mute actress and finds that their personae are melding together. A young nurse, Alma, is put in charge of Elisabeth Vogler: an actress who is seemingly healthy in all respects, but will not talk. As they spend time together, Alma speaks to Elisabeth constantly, never receiving any answer. Alma eventually confesses her secrets to a seemingly sympathetic Elisabeth and finds that her own personality is being submerged into Elisabeth's persona.—Kathy Li Swedish actress Elisabet Vogler, while on stage during a performance of Elektra, becomes mute. The day following, she is in a near catatonic state. The doctors in charge of her case diagnose no medical reason that would cause these disabilities. A nurse named Alma is assigned to be Elisabet's caretaker, she who believes that there is some sort of inner strength that Elisabet possesses to choose not to speak. Since Elisabet is not allowed visits by either her husband or her son, the doctor provides her own secluded beach side summer house as a respite for Elisabet and Alma. To break the silence during the respite, Alma speaks continually to Elisabet, ultimately about personal details of her life. Elisabet responds to Alma's talking, and Alma uses these situations as her own therapy sessions. Alma admires Elisabet and wants to be like her. As the women spend more time alone together, Alma learns more about her patient. But Alma also begins a transformation, which she now knowingly tries to stop because of those things she has learned about Elisabet.—Huggo A nurse at a psychiatric hospital, Alma, is given a new patient. Elisabet Vogler is a famous actress but has suddenly become apathetic, lethargic, mute and prone to fits of laughter at arbitrary, innocuous things. Alma does her best to engage Elisabet and get her to talk but the more Alma opens up to Elisabet, the more she empathises with her and becomes like her.—grantss A piece of visual poetry that elevates Bergman to a new level in his career. In this film the female figures form a relationship where there is a spiritual and emotional connection recognized as one of the most important creations of this director. Between contrasting images and dream light this is a film of great psychological depth. Elisabeth Vogler seems to have everything: she is a successful actress, happily married and mother of a small child. However, one night, she is paralyzed in the middle of a presentation, after this event she spends three months in the hospital without her condition being defined. After this period she spends her days in a summer house near the Baltic Sea where the nurse, Alma, assists her in her recovery. These two women form a powerful bond in which friendship and betrayal take place to change their lives. Persona begins with images of camera equipment and projectors lighting up and projecting dozens of brief cinematic glimpses, including a crucifixion, an erect penis, a tarantula spider, clips from a comedic silent-film reel first seen in Bergman's Prison (depicting a man trapped in a room, being chased by Death and Satan), and the slaughter of a lamb. The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Michail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (""Vår Tids Hjälte"" in the film), and caressing a blurry image of Elisabet and/or Alma's faces.A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera. As the two women leave the hospital together, Alma reads aloud a letter Elisabet's husband has sent her, which includes a photograph of her young son.Together in the administrator's cottage, Elisabet begins to relax, though she remains completely silent and non-responsive. Alma speaks constantly to break the silence, at first about books she is reading and trivial matters, then increasingly about her own anxieties and relationship with her fiancé, Karl-Henrik, who scolds her for lacking ambition ""though not with my career, I suppose in some greater way."" Alma constantly compares herself to Elisabet and begins to grow attached to her. As the act closes, Alma confesses to cheating on her fiancé in a ménage à quatre with underage boys. She became pregnant, and had Karl-Henrik's friend abort the baby; ""and that was that"". She is not sure how to process the abortion mentally. Elisabet is heard to say ""You ought to go to bed, or you'll fall asleep at the table"", but Alma dismisses it as a dream. Elisabet later denies speaking.Alma drives into town, taking Elisabet's letters for the postbox, but parks by the roadside to read what she wrote. She discovers in Elisabet's letters that Elisabet has been analyzing her and ""studying"" her. Alma returns distraught, accidentally breaks a drinking glass on the footpath, and leaves the shards there to cut Elisabet. When Elisabet's feet start to bleed, her gaze meets Alma's knowingly, and the film itself breaks apart: the screen flashes white, scratch marks appear up and down the image, the sound rises and screeches, and the film appears to unwind as brief flashes of the prelude reappear for fractions of a second each.When the film resumes, it is following Elisabet through the house with a thick blur on the lens. The image clears up with a sharp snap when she looks out the window before walking outside to meet Alma, who is weepy and bitter. At lunch, she tells Elisabet she has been hurt by Elisabet talking about her behind her back, and begs her to speak. When Elisabet does not react, the nurse flies into a rage. Alma tries to attack her and chases her through the cottage, but Elisabet hits her during the ensuing scuffle causing Alma's nose to start bleeding. In retaliation, Alma grabs a pot of boiling water off the stove and is about to fling it at Elisabet, but stops after hearing Elisabet wail ""No!"" Alma explains that Elisabet wouldn't have spoken had she not feared death. Alma goes to the bathroom, washes her face, and tries to pull herself together. She then goes to Elisabet and frustrated by her unresponsiveness tells her, ""You are inaccessible. They said you were healthy, but your sickness is of the worst kind: it makes you seem healthy. You act it so well everyone believes it, everyone except me, because I know how rotten you are inside."" Elisabet tries to walk away, but Alma pursues and continues to accost her. Elisabet flees, and Alma chases her begging for forgiveness. That evening, Elisabet opens a book she is reading and finds a famous Stroop Report photograph of Jews being arrested in the Warsaw Ghetto. Elisabet stares at details in the photograph, but mostly at the boy with his hands raised.That night, Alma watches Elisabet sleep, analyzing her face and the scars she covers with makeup. She hears a man yelling outside, and finds Elisabet's husband, Mr. Vogler, in the garden. Mr. Vogler (portrayed by Gunnar Björnstrand) mistakes Alma for his wife, and despite her repeatedly interjecting with ""I'm not your wife"", delivers a monologue about his love for her and the son they have together (repeating words he wrote to Elisabet in the opening act ""We must see each other as two anxious children""). Elisabet stands quietly beside the two, holding Alma's hand, and Alma admits her love for Mr. Vogler and accepts her role as the mother of Elisabet's child. The two make love with Elisabet sitting quietly next to the bed with a look of panic on her face, and afterward, Alma cries. The image of Elisabet becomes blurry.The climax of the film comes the next morning; Alma catches Elisabet in the kitchen with a pained expression on her face, holding a picture of a small boy. Alma then narrates Elisabet's life story back to her, while the camera focuses tightly on Elisabet's anguished face: at a party one night, a man tells her ""Elisabet, you have it virtually all in your armory as woman and artist. But you lack motherliness."" She laughs, because it sounds silly, but the idea sticks in her mind, and she lets her husband impregnate her. As the pregnancy progresses, she grows increasingly worried about her stretching and swelling body, her responsibility to her child, the pain of birth, and the idea of abandoning her career. Everyone Elisabet knows constantly says ""Isn't she beautiful? She has never been so beautiful"", but Elisabet makes repeated attempts to abort the fetus. After the child is born, she is repulsed by it, and prays for the death of her son. The child grows up tormented and desperate for affection. The camera turns to show Alma's face, and she repeats the same monologue again. At its conclusion, one half of the face of Alma and the other of Elisabet's visage are shown in split screen, such that they appear to have become one face. Alma panics and cries ""I'm not like you. I don't feel like you. I'm not Elisabet Vogler: you are Elisabet Vogler. I'm just here to help you!"" Alma leaves, and later returns, to find that Elisabet has become completely catatonic. Alma falls into a strange mood and gashes her arm, forcing Elisabet's lips to the wound and subsequently beating her. Alma packs her things and leaves the cottage alone, as the camera turns away from the women to show the crew and director filming the scene."

Blow-Up,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060176/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A fashion photographer unknowingly captures a death on film after following two lovers in a park. A successful mod photographer in London whose world is bounded by fashion, pop music, marijuana, and easy sex, feels his life is boring and despairing. Then he meets a mysterious beauty, and also notices something frightfully suspicious on one of his photographs of her taken in a park. The fact that he may have photographed a murder does not occur to him until he studies and then blows up his negatives, uncovering details, blowing up smaller and smaller elements, and finally putting the puzzle together.—Anonymous Thomas is a London-based photographer who leads the life of excess typical of late 1960s mod London. He is primarily a highly sought-after studio fashion photographer, although he is somewhat tiring of the vacuousness associated with it. He is also working on a book, a photographic collection of primarily darker images of human life, which is why he spent a night in a flophouse where he secretly took some photos. While he is out one day, Thomas spies a May-September female-male couple being affectionate with each other in a park. From a distance, he clandestinely starts to photograph them, hoping to use the photographs as the final ones for his book. The female eventually sees what he is doing and rushes over wanting him to stop and to give her the roll of film. She states that the photographs will make her already complicated life more complicated. Following him back to his studio, she does whatever she needs to to get the film. He eventually complies, however in reality he has provided her with a different roll. After he develops the photographs, he notices something further in the background of the shots. Blowing them up, he believes he either photographed an attempted murder or an actual murder. The photos begin a quest for Thomas to match his perception to reality.—Huggo In the 60's, in London, Thomas is a successful, dedicated and arrogant photographer. He has just left a homeless shelter, since he is preparing photos about violence, and drives his Rolls-Royce to his studio, where he is taking pictures of top-models. He goes to a park and starts randomly shooting pictures. He takes some pictures of a young woman and an old man together, and the woman tries to retrieve the negative. The woman follows him to his studio, trying to get the negative and offering even sex with him for the negative, but he gives another one to her. He becomes obsessed, trying to understand the interest of the woman in the pictures. Then he reveals the negative and blows-up some details, discovering what might be a dead body in the park.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil During the swinging 1960s, a London photographer believes he inadvertently photographed evidence of a murder only to have the evidence mysteriously disappear. Professional photographer Thomas saw nothing. And he saw everything. Enlargements of pictures he secretly took of a romantic couple in the park reveal a murder in progress. Or do they? Winner of 1966 Best Picture and Best Director Awards from the then-new National Society of Film Critics (as well as Oscar-nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay), directorMichelangelo Antonioni's Blow-Up is an influential, stylish study of paranoid intrigue and disorientation. It is also a time capsule of mod London, a mindscape of the era's fashions, free love, parties, music (Herbie Hancockwrote the score andThe Yardbirdsriff at a club) and hip languor.David Hemmingsplays the jaded photographer enlivened by the mystery in his photos.Vanessa Redgraveis the elusive woman pictured in them. And the enigma of what you see, what you don't see and what the camera sees is yours to solve. The plot is 24 hours in the life of a glamorous fashion photographer named Thomas (David Hemmings), inspired by the life of an actual ""Swinging London"" photographer, David Bailey.In the opening scene, Thomas wakes up after spending the night at a doss house where he has taken pictures for a book of art photos. He is late for a photo shoot with Veruschka von Lehndorff (playing herself) at his studio, which in turn makes him late for a shoot with other models later in the morning. He grows bored and walks off, leaving the models and production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage girls who are aspiring models, a blond (Jane Birkin) and a dark-haired brunette (Gillian Hills) ask to speak with him, but the photographer drives off to look at an antiques shop.Wandering into Maryon Park, he takes photos of two lovers making out. The woman (Vanessa Redgrave) is furious at being photographed and demands that Thomas hand over the film, but he refuses. When she walks away to rejoin her boyfriend, he is gone and she runs away with Thomas taking photos of her as she runs.Thomas then meets his agent for lunch, and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Back at his studio, the mysterious woman from the park arrives asking for the film, but he refuses. The woman introduces herself as 'Jane' and tries to seduce Thomas by removing her top to entice him to hand over the film and negatives. Thomas agrees without going any further, but he deliberately hands Jane a different roll of unused blank film. She in turn writes down a telephone number to give to him.After Jane leaves, Thomas begins work on developing his photos that he took that day. His many enlargements of the black and white film are grainy but he finds something strange. In the Maryon Park photos, Thomas notices a figure hiding in the bushes near Jane and her boyfriend and upon enlarging them in a series of 'blow-up' shots, sees that it is a man with a gun (the same man he saw following him earlier). In the shots where Jane is running away with her back to the camera, Thomas also notices something on the ground in the distance. The blow-up shots of the blurred figure on the ground that Jane is running to appears to be a body in the grass. Thomas gets the feeling that he just witnessed the before and afterwards of a murder.Thomas is disturbed by a knock on the door, but it is only the two girls again, with whom he has a group-sex romp in his studio and falls asleep. Awakening, he finds they hope he will photograph them but he tells them to leave, saying, ""Tomorrow! Tomorrow!""As evening falls, Thomas goes back to the park to investigate and finds a dead body (Jane's dead lover), but he has not brought his camera and is scared off by a twig breaking, as if being stepped on by someone unseen watching him. Thomas returns to his studio to find that someone (possibly Jane and her gunman accomplice) has broken into his place and all the negatives and prints from the park are gone except for one large, very grainy blowup showing the body (which proves nothing). He tries to call the phone number Jane gave him, but learns from the operator that the number does not exist.After driving into town, he sees Jane and follows her into a club where The Yardbirds, featuring both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck on guitar and Keith Relf on vocals, are seen performing the song ""Stroll On."" A buzz in Beck's amplifier angers him so much he smashes his guitar on stage, then throws its neck into the crowd, the photographer makes a grab for it as a souvenir. Thomas grabs the neck and runs out of the club before anyone can snatch it from him. Then he has second thoughts about it, throws it on the pavement and walks away. A passer-by picks up the neck and throws it back down, not realizing it's from Beck's guitar.Thomas then goes to a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames near central London. He finds a strung-out Veruschka, who had told him that she was going to Paris, and when confronted, she says she is in Paris. Thomas then meets his agent Ron (Peter Bowles), whom he wants to bring to the park as a witness to show the dead body. However, Thomas (after taking a few puffs from a joint given by a party guest) cannot put across what he has photographed. Ron invites him to stay and they take LSD. Waking up in the house at sunrise after the party, Thomas takes a spare camera from Ron's house with film in it and goes back to the park alone to take photos of the murder victim, but the body is gone without any trace.Befuddled and emotionally defeated, Thomas (aware that someone has just gotten away with murder), begins walking out of the park when, he watches a group of mimes arrive and play a mimed tennis match. Thomas is drawn into it when the mimes beckon him to retrieve their imaginary tennis ball that they have ""lost"". Beat and deciding to play along, Thomas picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two mimes playing. While he watches the mimes, the sound of the ball being played is heard. Thomas walks out of the park as his image fades away, leaving only the grass as the movie comes to an end."

Hung together through the rough times; now things were looking up, MacDonald was not ready to sell, so he's holding out and Jason was pushing, and now I'm standing right in the middle.""Saloon owner Maudie (Charlene Holt) walks in and throws her arms around Cole.
She bursts out laughing when she realizes that her old flame and her current one are friends. Cole gave her a stake some time earlier to help her sort out her money problems when her gambling husband was killed.Thornton goes off to Jason's ranch to tell him that he's not going to work for him.

A young man nicknamed Mississippi (James Caan) enters and confronts one of four men sitting at a dinner table, reminding him if he remembers him or if he remembers the black hat he is wearing?

He says he caught up with the man's other three companions and he killed them all. He asks the last of the murderers to stand up.

One of the men sitting at the table is Nelse Macleod (Christopher George), a dark thin-faced man with a scar down the left side of his eye and cheek.

He stops off at an old gunsmith friend's and gets him a shotgun to use. Cole and Mississippi arrive in El Dorado and stop off at Maudie's to find out if any strangers have been hanging around. She says no and she tells him the full extent of J.P's alcoholism.

Cole goes inside to wake up J.P., who's asleep in the cell. He throws some water over him to wake him up. J.P punches him and and Cole knocks him out with a pan to his head. Mississippi makes some special drink in order to keep him off the booze. With the black-looking mixture in his system, any alcohol J.P drinks afterwards will just make him feel sick.The next afternoon, Bart Jason arrives in town and waits in the saloon for Nelse Macleod to turn up. At the same time, the Macdonald family arrive for their weekly town shopping. Bull goes off to keep an eye on the Macdonald's and tells Colt he'll blow on his trumpet if there's any trouble. Later at night, J.P. gets up, looking for some alcohol. Cole tells him they've got rid of it all. J.P. goes over to the saloon to get a bottle of whiskey and Bart and Macleod start laughing at him. He walks back in shame. Gunshots are heard and Bull blows the trumpet. Cole and Mississippi run out and find one of Macdonald's boys wounded. Cole, J.P., Mississippi and Bull search the town for the gunmen responsible. A woman comes to the window and tells Mississippi that she saw a few men take off down the street towards he church.
A gunfight breaks out and two of the men are killed but the man with the limp gets away. They follow him into Jason's saloon. J.P. is angry from the humiliation he had earlier and he wants to prove what he's made of. Everyone denies seeing a man enter but the pianist looks nervous. J.P. tells him to get out of the way and begins firing his rifle at the piano. The gunman comes out from hiding and starts shooting but J.P kills him. The barman goes for a gun but J.P. shoots the top of the bar and a load of wooden splinters go through his hand. J.P. approaches the men who were laughing at him earlier. He hits one man in the stomach with the rifle and whacks Jason over the face. He's ready to shoot him but Cole intervenes. J.P. calms down and arrests him.As they are taking him to jail, Mississippi sees someone pointing a gun at them from the stable and goes to check it out. He grabs the person and sees it's a woman, in fact Joey, who was trying to get a shot at Bart for revenge. He takes her over to the jail to confirm her identity. She asks J.P. if Jason will get what he deserves. He says it's up to the judge. She thanks them for what they've done and leaves.Cole and Mississippi walk around the town on night-watch and some of Jason's men come riding along. Mississippi dives into the street right in front of the horses' hooves. The horses jump over him and he shoots one of the men. J.P. comes running out of the office and takes a bullet in the leg. As Cole tends to his wound inside, he asks Mississippi why he dove under the horses and he tells him that you can't shoot properly while your horse is jumping in the air and an horse won't step on a person.The doctors are in the office removing the bullet from J.P's leg. They tell Cole that it would be a good idea for him to have the bullet removed from his back. Cole tells them if he survives all the trouble with Jason's men, he'll have it taken care of.J.P. is feeling restless and frustrated and trying to control his need to drink. He comes up with the idea to lock themselves away in the office with some food and water until the U.S. marshal arrives to pick Jason up. Bull recommends that he cleans himself up if they're going to be confined together. While J.P. takes a bath, Joey and Maudie bring some things around for them to last them until the marshal's arrival. Cole gets angry with her and tells her that it's best for her to stay away because Jason's men might use her to get Jason back from them.Later at night, a friend of Maudie's arrives with a note from Maudie saying that Macleod's men have been hanging around her place and that she's heard that they've got something planned. Cole and Mississippi go over to to the saloon but a gunman starts shooting at them. They chase him through the saloon, out to the back door.
Two men tell them the person went out the back door. Mississippi luckily recognizes the men as Milt and Pedro and remembers the incident from their previous encounter. Cole asks if him anyone's waiting outside for them. Milt says no but Cole tells him to walk out. Milt doesn't want to but Cole shoots him in the arm and tells him to go. Milt says he lied, there's somebody out there. Cole shoots him in the leg.
With no choice, Milt runs out of the doors shouting not to shoot but he is gunned down. Cole tells Pedro to go next but as he is trying to force him out the doors, he starts suffering with the numbness down his arm again. He falls to the floor in pain.
Pedro goes for his gun but Mississippi kills him but he is knocked out from behind.Mississippi and Maudie go to the office through the back door to tell them what's happened. Macleod has Cole and wants to trade him for Jason. J.P. reluctantly agrees. He frees Jason and he, Cole, Bull and Mississippi flee town and hide out at his place. Bull is suspicious that Macleod let them get out of town too easily.Joey turns up to tell them that her brother Saul has been kidnapped by Jason and he will only be returned if the Macdonald ranch is handed over to him. With Bull's age, Mississippi's poor shooting skills, and Cole and J.P's crippled condition, the odds are stacked against them. Cole realizes he can still use a rifle with one hand, so they hatch a plan.They ride back into town. Cole drives a wagon to the front of the saloon to confront Macleod, who has Jason and a few men at his side; while a few of the other men keep watch over Saul in the saloon. J.P., Mississippi and Bull go through the back door to get behind them. Bull fires an arrow into the back of one of Macleod's men and blows his bugle, which distracts Macleod long enough for Cole to jump from the wagon and gun him down. J.P. and Mississippi handle the rest of the men inside.
Jason goes to grab one of Macleod's guns to kill Cole but Joey is hiding in the distance and shoots him first.. Cole thanks her for saving his life. He walks over to Macleod as he lays dying. He says to him ""You never gave me a chance at all did you?"" Cole replies ""No, I didn't. You're too good to give a chance to,"" leaving Macleod to die with his pride intact.The story ends as Cole has his leg wrapped up from scattershot from Mississippi who accidentally caught him with his shotgun during the gunfight. Mississippi goes off to talk to Joey, Cole goes off to see Maudie, and J.P. and Bull have a drink while J.P. tells him he needs him as his deputy. The story ends with Cole and J.P. both now limping down the street as Cole prepares to leave town and J.P. has gained his self respect back."

Engineer Jake Holman arrives aboard the gunboat U.S.S. San Pablo, assigned to patrol a tributary of the Yangtze in the middle of exploited and revolution-torn 1926 China. His iconoclasm and cynical nature soon clash with the ""rice-bowl"" system which runs the ship and the uneasy symbiosis between Chinese and foreigner on the river. Hostility towards the gunboat's presence reaches a climax when the boat must crash through a river-boom and rescue missionaries upriver at China Light Mission.—Martin H. Booda <booda@datasync.com> 1926. China is the middle of a revolution. U.S., British, and French gunboats patrol the rivers, but are meant to be neutral in the conflict, though this does not stop them from being attacked. Onto one such U.S. gunboat, the U.S.S. San Pablo (""Sand Pebble"" to its crew) steps Petty Officer Jake Holman, newly-appointed chief engineer.—grantss Gunboat San Pablo has no clear mission and has fallen into a state of ease with Chinese locals doing all the work. Lazily patrolling a Chinese backwater amid a civil war, the gunboat gets a new engineer, Jake Holman (Steve McQueen). Jake has been a rebel and has a history of numerous transfers. Jake is despised by almost all the crew mates except by Frenchy Burgoyne (Richard Attenborough). Frenchy's affair with a Chinese girl gives a chance for the locals to spark a political incident.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com In 1926, U.S. Naval engineer Jake Holman is assigned to the gun boat U.S.S. San Pablo, nicknamed the ""Sand Pebble"", this being the latest in a very long string of assignments due to an unyielding view of his work leading to conflicts with many of his colleagues and ship Captains. Life on the Sand Pebble is no different. The Sand Pebble is patrolling the interior waters of China, where the the U.S. government is trying to protect its interests in the face of Nationalist and Communist battles against the feudal warlords. On-board the Sand Pebble, Holman must deal with a Captain whose wants often do not match what Holman can carry out. Ultimately, the Sand Pebble is placed under quiet siege by the Chinese, who are using this action as a symbol of the unwanted U.S. presence. Holman is implicated in an incident which could cause the start of an all out war, and as such places him in a bad position with his shipmates. Amidst all of this turmoil, two romances occur, the first between Holman's colleague, good-hearted Frenchy Burgoyne and a slave girl named Maily, and the second between Holman and missionary schoolteacher, Shirley Eckert. Both romances face major obstacles.—Huggo For troubled hero Jake Holman (Steve ""Lightning"" McQueen), no good deed goes unpunished.Transferred in 1926 to the U.S.S. San Pablo (whose crew is nicknamed the ""Sand Pebbles""), a gunboat serving on the Yangtze River Patrol in China, engineer Holman finds that Chinese coolies are actually doing most of the work on the ship. When he insists on working on the ship's engines himself, he earns the enmity of the Chinese ""boss"" of the engine room. Captain Collins (Richard Crenna) dismisses Holman's warnings that the machinery needs significant maintenance, and when the ship experiences inevitable engine troubles, the engine room boss is crushed to death by a giant piston when Holman lets him attempt the repair. The head coolie boss bitterly blames Holman for the accident.Told to train a replacement for the dead man, Holman chooses Po-Han (Mako), whom he also befriends, overcoming his bigoted assumptions about the intellectual abilities of the Chinese. Holman sticks up for Po-Han against a bully, and sets him up to win in a prize fight against his tormentor, crewman Stawski (Simon Oakland). Shipmate Frenchy (Richard Attenborough) uses the money to pay for the freedom of a young Chinese woman, Maily (Emmanuelle Arsan), saving her from a life of prostitution. Po-Han is later captured and tortured by a Communist mob because he works for the Americans. The captain attempts to pay ransom money to trade for Po-Han, but is ignored by the mob. Unable to save his friend, Holman shoots Po-Han to end his suffering. This further enrages the Communists, and the captain rebukes Holman for disobeying orders. The Captain informs Holman that because of his meddling, two crew workers have died and he intends on having him transferred out of the San Pablo.Frenchy eventually marries Maily in a makeshift ceremony witnessed by Holman and his love interest, Shirley Eckert (Candice Bergen), an American teacher at the China Light Mission. The Chinese form a naval blockade around the San Pablo, but Shirley is able to return to the mission accompanied on a boat with a student leader. When increasing tensions with the Chinese force the Americans to spend all winter on board under siege, Frenchy slips overboard and swims to shore to visit Maily. Made desperately ill by exposure to the cold water, Frenchy ignores Maily's pleas to return for medical care. Holman, permitted to go ashore to deliver the ship's mail to the US Consulate, visits them, but finds that Frenchy has died the night before. Holman pleads with Maily to leave with him to the China Light Mission for protection, but is interrupted by Chinese thugs. Anti-American nationalists kill Maily and her unborn child, and frame Holman for the murder. He makes it back to the ship where his fellow sailors come close to mutiny when the Captain refuses to hand over Holman to the Chinese for prosecution. Feeling that he has lost command of his ship, the captain contemplates suicide.Just as spring arrives, bringing a rise in the river water levels and the opportunity to escape the siege, news reaches the San Pablo that revolutionaries have begun open violence against Americans in Nanking. The captain ignores orders to return to the coast and goes to attempt to rescue the Americans at China Light Mission. -- Shirley Eckert and the idealistic missionary Jameson (Larry Gates). To reach the mission, the gunboat must break through a blockade of junks manned by the very same boys educated at the missionary school, including the student leader who had been protecting Jameson. Holman has to cut through a thick boom rope with an axe in order to break through the blockade. Holman kills a student leader with the axe near the end of the fighting between the sailors and junk blockaders. The captain decides to take a small group to rescue the missionaries and informs the Ensign to sail back to the coast if the rescue party cannot return in time. The captain and a few men, including Holman, reach the nearly abandoned mission compound to find Jameson and Shirley reluctant to leave. Jameson says that he is a ""stateless person"" and has renounced his citizenship with his submission of a document to Geneva, so the rescue attempt is not justified since he no longer considers the US to be his protector. He says that the students will protect him and Shirley. Jameson insists that the missionaries are in danger only because of the actions of the American gunboat personnel who back the warlords. The captain refuses to listen to Jameson and insists on escorting them out of the mission because of the imminent danger. Collins tries to have Jameson and Shirley forcibly removed from the mission, but Holman refuses the order to do that and informs the Captain of his desire to remain with them. As Collins and Holman are arguing, one of the student leaders arrives wounded at the mission after having been shot by troops, but after talking to Jameson, he is then subsequently shot dead by Chinese soldiers. Jameson attempts to communicate with the soldiers saying that he is not tied to the American foreigners anymore, but is also shot. When the captain is killed attempting to provide cover for the others to escape, Holman takes his place, remaining behind while the other sailors slip away with Shirley to freedom. Holman shouts out loud commands in an attempt to keep the focus of attention of the soldiers on him only. He kills several snipers from the rooftops. Holman tries to escape too, before he is shot. His dying words are, ""I was home. What happened? What the hell happened?"""

Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061184/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bitter, aging couple, with the help of alcohol, use their young houseguests to fuel anguish and emotional pain towards each other over the course of a distressing night. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) are a middle-aged married couple, whose charged relationship is defined by vitriolic verbal battles, which underlies what seems like an emotional dependence upon each other. This verbal abuse is fueled by an excessive consumption of alcohol. George being an associate history professor in a New Carthage university where Martha's father is the President adds an extra dimension to their relationship. Late one Saturday evening after a faculty mixer, Martha invites Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis), an ambitious young biology professor new to the university and his mousy wife, over for a nightcap. As the evening progresses, Nick and Honey, plied with more alcohol, get caught up in George and Martha's games of needing to hurt each other and everyone around them. The ultimate abuse comes in the form of talk of George and Martha's unseen sixteen-year-old son, whose birthday is the following day.—Huggo History associate professor George (Richard Burton) and his boozy wife, Martha (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), return late one Saturday night from a cocktail party at the home of the university president, Martha's father. Martha announces that she invited another couple, newly appointed instructor Nick (George Segal) and his timid wife, Honey (Sandy Dennis), over for a nightcap. When the younger couple arrive, the night erupts into a no-holds-barred torrent of marital angst and verbal tirades.—Jwelch5742 Psychological realism and foul language: George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) are as far from the bourgeois 1950s perfect married couple as you can get, alternatively badgering, berating, abusing, and loving each other, both alone and accompanied by the naïve young married couple that have come over for a nightcap. The fun and games in which George and Martha involve Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) are a lacerating look at the older couple's existence, where the emotional brutalizing fill an unspeakable void at their center, and a troubling preview of what the younger couple's life could become. Combines the banal, the vulgar, and the poetic.—Russ W. <russwlkr@ix.netcom.com> One literate and profane night in the pathological marriage of two tortured souls, a middle-aged New England associate professor and his carping wife. Turning the underbelly of bourgeois academia into a microcosm of human relationships in all their arduous complexities, it's a harrowing descent into the private lives and painful secrets of two couples thrown together for an evening. George (Richard Burton) is an associate professor of history who has turned to alcohol to deal with his vituperative, vicious wife Martha (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), whose appetite for administering abuse knows no bounds. Invited to the couple's home for late-night drinks are new professor Nick (George Segal), and his naive wife Honey, where over the course of the evening, the polished veneer of the hosts tarnishes grotesquely. The witty repartee of consummate sophisticate Martha degenerates into increasingly violent verbal abuse of both her husband and guests, while George's stoic façade crumbles both physically and emotionally. The horrified Nick and Honey (Sandy Dennis) initially come off as happier foils to the misery of the older married couple, but the guests are soon mirroring George and Martha in their mutual antagonism, giving voice to buried resentments and alcohol-fueled revelations of repressed injuries.—filmfactsman Set on the campus of a small New England college, the film focuses on the volatile relationship of a middle-aged couple: associate history professor George (Richard Burton) and his alcoholic wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), the daughter of the university president.It's 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning, and they have returned from one of her father's Saturday night gatherings. Martha announces she has invited a young couple--Nick (George Segal), a young, good-looking, newly appointed instructor, and his mousey wife Honey (Sandy Dennis)--to join them for late-night drinks. George is disturbed because she did so without consulting him first, prompting Martha to launch into the first of many loud and lengthy tirades during which she taunts and criticizes him. Knowing his wife is drunk and quite lewd, he asks her to behave herself when they arrive, and when the doorbell rings, he warns her to refrain from mentioning their child to their company.Overhearing Martha's crude retort as the door opens, Nick and Honey immediately feel ill at ease and quickly find themselves caught in the middle of a verbal war zone when their efforts to engage in small talk set off a volley of insults between their hosts. Martha begins to flirt lewdly with Nick while his meek wife tries to pretend she is unaware of what is happening.While Martha is showing Honey where the bathroom is, George tests Nick's verbal sparring skills, but the young man is no match for his host. Realizing he and his wife are becoming embroiled in the middle of marital warfare, he suggests they depart, but George cajoles him into staying.Upon returning to the living room alone, Honey innocently mentions to George she was unaware he and Martha had a son on the verge of celebrating his 16th birthday. Martha reappears in a new outfit--form-fitting slacks and a revealing blouse--and when her husband makes a snide remark about the ensemble, she begins to demean his abilities as a teacher, then escalates her seduction of Nick, complimenting him on the body he developed as both a quarterback and an intercollegiate state boxing champion while criticizing George's paunch. She informs their guests about a past incident when George refused to engage in a friendly outdoor boxing match with his father-in-law and Martha put on a pair of gloves and punched him in the jaw, knocking him into the bushes. As she relates the story, George aims a shotgun at the back of her head, causing Honey to scream. He pulls the trigger, which releases an umbrella, while he tells his wife she's dead.Honey again raises the subject of George and Martha's son, prompting the couple to engage in a conversation Martha quickly tries to end without success. To counterattack George's relentless comments about the boy, she tells their guests her husband is unsure the child is his own, although he most assuredly is. They argue about the color of the boy's eyes until George threatens to expose the truth about the boy. Furious, Martha accuses him of being a failure whose youthful, idealistic plans for the future slowly deteriorated as he came to realize he wasn't aggressive enough to follow in his father-in-law's footsteps, leaving her stuck with a flop. George cuts the diatribe short by spinning Honey around and mockingly singing, ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" a joke the shrewd Martha had made herself during the party earlier that evening.Inebriated and on the verge of throwing up from George's spinning, Honey rushes from the room. Martha goes to the kitchen to make coffee, and George and Nick go outside. The younger man confesses he was attracted to Honey more for her family's money than passion, and married her only because she mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with. This boy had accidentally killed his mother. Years later, George claims the boy was driving with his father. He swerved to ""miss a porcupine"" in the road, and the resulting accident killed his father. The boy ended up living out his days in a mental hospital.When their guests propose leaving, George insists on driving them home. In the car, the talk returns to George and Martha's son. They approach a roadhouse, and Honey suggests they stop to dance. While Honey and George watch, Nick suggestively dances with Martha, who continues to mock George and criticize his inadequacies. George unplugs the jukebox and announces the game is over. In response, Martha alludes to the fact he may have murdered his parents like the protagonist in his unpublished, non-fiction novel, prompting George to strangle Martha until Nick manages to pull him away from her.George convinces the owner to serve them one more round before closing and suggests that, having played a game of 'Humiliate the Host,' the quartet should now engage in 'Hump the Hostess' or 'Get the Guests.' He then tells the group about a second novel he allegedly has written about a young couple from the Midwest, a good-looking teacher and his timid wife, who marry because of her hysterical pregnancy and then settle in a small college town. An embarrassed Honey realizes Nick indiscreetly told George about their past and runs from the room with Nick in pursuit.In the parking lot, George tells his wife he cannot stand the way she constantly humiliates him, and she tauntingly accuses him of having married her for just that reason. Their rage erupts into a declaration of ""total war."" Martha drives off with Nick and Honey, leaving her husband to follow on foot.When George arrives home, he discovers Honey passed out in the car's back seat and realizes his wife has taken Nick upstairs to their bedroom. When Martha accuses Nick of being sexually inadequate, he blames his impotency on all the liquor he has consumed. George mentions his and Martha's son, prompting her to reminisce about his birth and childhood and how he nearly was destroyed by his father. George accuses Martha of engaging in destructive and abusive behavior with the boy, who frequently ran away to escape her sexual advances. George then announces he has received a telegram with bad news--the boy was killed the previous afternoon on a country road when he swerved to avoid hitting a porcupine and crashed into a tree.As Martha argues with George that he ""can't do this"" and begs him not to ""kill"" their son, Nick suddenly realizes the truth--Martha and George had never been able to have a baby, for reasons that are unexplained. Instead, their game together is to imagine they have a son and invent situations and stories of him. By declaring their son dead, accordingly, George has ""killed"" him (There are hints of this throughout the movie that become clear in retrospect--for example, when George and Nick were sitting by the swing waiting for Honey to finish throwing up, George comments quietly that Martha never had any pregnancies).The young couple departs quietly, and George and Martha are left alone as the day begins to break outside. They speak quietly, and in the last lines Martha answers the title question with ""I am, George, I am."""
Gambit,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060445/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An English cat burglar needs a Eurasian dancer's help to pull off the perfect heist, but even the most foolproof schemes have a way of backfiring. Cockney cat burglar Harry Dean needs Hong Kong dancer Nicole Chang's help to pull off the perfect heist. With a simple makeover and a new wardrobe; Nicole's resemblance to wealthy recluse Mr. Shahbandar's late wife is uncanny. While Shahbandar is distracted by the mesmerizing Nicole, Harry takes steps to swipe a priceless artifact from under the tycoon's nose. But even the most foolproof schemes have a way of backfiring.—L. Hamre In Hong Kong, Eurasian exotic dancer Nicole Chang catches the attention of British high stakes cat burglar Harry Dean, who wants to use her in his latest scheme which also includes his partner, art expert Emile Fournier. The end goal is to steal the priceless statue of the Chinese Empress Li Soo from Ahmed Shahbandar, the richest man in the world who lives in the Middle Eastern country of Dammuz. Harry chose Nicole as his accomplice since she resembles Shahbandar's long deceased wife, who was the only love of his life, and Empress Li Soo herself. The plot involves Harry and Nicole traveling to Dammuz masquerading as Sir Harold and Lady Dean. There, news of Nicole being Shahbandar's wife and Li Soo's look-a-like will make its way back to Shahbandar. He in turn will invite Harry and Nicole to his apartment, where Harry will scope out the situation to steal the statue. While Nicole keeps Shahbandar occupied for the evening, Harry will steal the statue. Nicole will excuse herself temporarily from Shahbandar's company, in reality making her way to the airport, where she will meet Harry who will give her her passport, plane ticket back to Hong Kong and her five thousand U.S. dollar cut, the two never to see each other again. Harry will tell her only as much as she needs to know to carry out the plan. Harry's thoughts for the scheme don't come off quite as he anticipates, primarily because of Nicole and Shahbandar not reacting the way he anticipates. Nicole is difficult to convince, and she isn't the demure and refined Asian he had pictured, but rather a strong willed and chatterbox of a woman, who has a mind of her own and who says what she wants. And Shahbandar believes that Nicole looking exactly like his deceased wife, down to the hair and clothes, is just a little too coincidental for his comfort, he who has his eyes on the collective movements of ""Sir Harold and Lady Dean"", which he is certain are aliases. But these two wrongs may result in a right end goal for Harry. However, there is one other factor which Harry does not count on, namely what happens between him and Nicole.—Huggo Cockney cat burglar Harry Tristan Dean (Michael Caine) and his sculptor friend Emile Fournier (John Abbott) discover exotic Eurasian showgirl Nicole Chang (Shirley MacLaine) in a crowded Hong Kong restaurant. She bears an incredible resemblance both to the late wife of the world's richest man, an Arab named Ahmad Shahbandar (Herbert Lom), as well as to a priceless ancient Chinese statuette that he owns; Harry and Emile want to use her in a scheme to rob Shahbandar of it. Harry's mere explanation to Emile of the caper-in which Nicole meekly obeys instructions without even a single expression-is flawless.Harry, Nicole (who initially resisted the offer), and Emile arrive in the Middle Eastern city of Dammuz; the former two assume the identities of Sir Harold Dean and Lady Nicole Dean and check into Shahbandar's hotel where Shahbandar himself lives in the penthouse. Harry's plot does not at all follow his imagined scenario; Shahbandar himself discovers Harry's deceitfulness, and only plays along with Harry and Nicole to see what they are plotting. She is aghast when she learns what Harry wants to steal, but goes along because she is falling in love with him.Shahbandar invites them to dinner; Harry refuses but persuades Nicole to accept, so she will occupy Shahbandar while he will steal the statuette. Nicole, however, realizes that Shahbandar suspects them, and slips away to warn Harry. Working together, they steal the statuette without triggering the alarm; but a misplaced impulse afterwards causes Nicole to accidentally trigger the alarm anyway. At Harry's insistence, Nicole flees to the airport to return separately to Hong Kong, while he hides from the guards; he watches as they also check a secret compartment in the wall of the room, where the real statuette is hidden: the one in Harry's hands is a copy.Shahbandar then rechecks the secret compartment, finds the fake, and has Nicole arrested at the airport. At breakfast, he tells her that his agents have found Harry in Hong Kong; he too will be arrested unless the real statuette is returned. She is free to go with a dossier of Harry if she takes that message to him.At Emile's workshop in Hong Kong, Harry reveals that he actually hid the statuette inside a Buddha statue Emile had sold Shahbandar, and left the hotel a telegraph of this while she was traveling. In the least, Harry only wanted to give the appearance that it had been stolen, as no one yet knows when Shahbandar will reverse that credibility. Emile, in fact, made an exact replica of the statuette as well as the decoy that Shahbandar had on display; and with three prospective buyers already waiting, Harry and Emile must now sell the replica as the real thing.Nicole proves unhappy at Harry's criminal lifestyle, so Harry smashes the replica to prove she is more important to him than his life of crime. She and Harry leave Emile supposedly disconsolate-until he receives a telephone call afterwards, happily starts making arrangements with a buyer, and takes one of more replicas of the statuette."

He's married with a grown daughter he rarely sees anymore. He is generally disengaged from everything in his life. Based on a series of telephone calls he receives from his supposedly deceased friend Charlie Evans, Arthur is drawn into a company that provides him with a second chance in life. Initially resisting this opportunity, 'they' convince him that he has little to live for in his current life, which includes a past indiscretion, albeit one unintentional on his part. His 'rebirth' will include a cadaver to replace his current body after his death, enough money for his current family to live comfortably after his departure, enough money for his new start in life, a surgical make-over of his current self, and a new identity based on his subconscious desires. This new identity is as a Malibu based painter christened Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson. To assist him in this transition to Tony Wilson, the company provides him with a counselor of sorts, acting as a live-in housekeeper named John, who attends to whatever Tony requires emotionally to make the transition successfully. Even with John's help, Tony is finding it difficult to make the transition, despite or perhaps in spite of meeting a woman named Nora Marcus, with whom he falls in love.

Tony meets the lonely Nora Marcus on the beach and they have a love affair. But sooner Tony realizes that his fake world does not give satisfaction to him and he returns to the company requesting another life. But the rules are not so easy to be changed.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) is a middle-aged man whose life has lost purpose.

The Company, in the person of Mr. Ruby (Jeff Corey), interviews Hamilton, then shows him a film of him attacking a girl after he'd unknowingly consumed drugged food & drink offered him by the Company. They threaten to blackmail Hamilton forcing him to sign on, foreshadowing the unfortunate consequences of accepting the Company's assistance.Hamilton's death is staged to make it look as if he perished in a hotel fire with a corpse left disguised as him. Through extensive plastic surgery and psychoanalysis, Hamilton is transformed into Tony Wilson (Rock Hudson). He is provided with a new home, a new identity (as Wilson), new friends and a devoted manservant. The details of his new existence suggest that there was once a real Tony Wilson, but what became of him is a mystery.Wilson copes with his new world. Relocated to a fancy home in Malibu, California, where he is an already established artist, he commences a relationship with a young woman named Nora Marcus (Salome Jens) and for a time he is happy but soon becomes troubled by the emotional confusion of his new identity, as well as by the exuberance of renewing his youth.At a dinner party he hosts for neighbors, Wilson drinks himself into a stupor and begins to babble about his former life as Hamilton. It turns out that his neighbors are ""reborns"" like himself, sent to keep an eye on his adjustment. Nora is actually an agent of the Company and her attentions to Wilson are designed merely to ensure his cooperation.In violation of Company policy, Wilson, posing as an old friend of her husband's, visits his former wife (Frances Reid) in his new persona. He learns that his marriage had failed because he was distracted by the pursuit of career and material possessions, the very things in life that others made him believe were important.Wilson returns to the Company and announces a desire to start again with yet another identity. The Company offers to accommodate him, but asks if he would first provide the names of some past acquaintances who might like to be ""reborn."" He refuses since he now knows of the drawbacks to being ""reborn"" and also doesn't want to delay the Company's procedure for a new identity for himself.While awaiting his reassignment, Wilson encounters Charlie Evans (Murray Hamilton), the friend who had originally recruited him into the Company. Evans was also ""reborn"" and likewise could not make a go of his new life. Together, they speculate on the reason for their failure to adjust, attributing it to the fact that they allowed others, including the Company, to make life choices for them.This realization comes too late. Wilson/Hamilton is suddenly strapped to a gurney and as he is wheeled down the hallway, a priest reads him his last rites. He is eventually wheeled into a small room where he learns that failed reborns are not actually provided with new identities but instead become the cadavers used to fake new clients' deaths."

Coming-of-age story for two girls, Mary Clancy (Hayley Mills) and Rachel Devery (June Harding), who find themselves as students at the St. Francis Academy, a Catholic boarding school for girls. The story spans three years and follows the girls and their many pranks including setting off fire alarms, smoking cigars in the basement, and putting bubble baths in the nuns' sugar bowls. As the girls mature, they gain a greater respect for their teachers and the commitment and devotion required to be a nun, leading one of them to make a life-changing decision.—garykmcd St. Francis Academy for Girls used to be a quiet sedate convent school - quiet and sedate, that is, until it was invaded by its newest pupil, Mary Clancy (Hayley Mills). Mary is a hellion who's youthful spirits keep Mother Superior (Rosalind Russell) in a constant state of panic as she and her friend, Rachel Devery (June Harding), substitute bubble bath for the nun's sugar, smoke cigars in the boiler room, and attempt to make a life-mask of the face of a fellow student with quick-hardening plaster.

Funeral in Berlin,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060437/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Sent to East Berlin to retrieve a Communist defector, British spy Harry Palmer suspects the situation is not what his superiors believe it to be. British agent, Harry Palmer's sent to East Berlin, after they've received word that a highly valuable member of the East's espionage power structure, wants to defect. But only under certain conditions; he wants Harry Palmer to be the one who carries out the plan to help him defect.—Dave Jenkins <david.jenkins@smallworld.co.uk> Berlin in the 1960s is a city divided between Cold War lines with inhabitants of the Communist East trying to escape to the West. Even with the infamous Berlin Wall these escapes are common and successful.Colonel Stok (Oskar Homolka), the head of intelligence in Russia's Berlin section and the one responsible for preventing escapes over the Wall, contacts British Intelligence and informs them that he wants to defect to the West. British spy Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) is sent to West Berlin to find out if Stok's offer is genuine and arrange his escape. Palmer was once involved in black market dealings in Berlin and was given the choice of joining British Intelligence or going to jail. Returning to the city, he is re-united with his old associate, German national Johnny Vulkan (Paul Hubschmid), who also works for Palmer's superior Colonel Ross (Guy Doleman).Vulkan arranges for Palmer to go to East Berlin to meet Colonel Stok. In exchange for his co-operation with the British, Stok requests a meagre stipend, a house in the country and his escape must be carried out by Kreutzmann (Günter Meisner), a Berlin gangster responsible for the most successful escapes. Stok claims that Kreutzmann's escapes have lead his department to be investigated and that he must get out before things turn nasty.Returning to West Berlin, Palmer is picked up by a beautiful young woman called Samantha Steel (Eva Renzi), who invites him to a party but instead takes him to her flat for drinks, dinner and presumably more as Palmer is next seen leaving her place in the morning. Not taken in by Samantha's charms, Palmer hires a burglar to search her apartment to figure out who she really is. The thief discovers a number of passports of various nationalities under different variations of her name and a little black book in her safe which lists names of men next to million-dollar figures. Returning to his hotel room, Palmer finds that it too has been ransacked.Palmer negotiates an arrangement with Kreutzmann without revealing the details of the one whom the British want to get across the Wall. As part of his payment, Kreutzmann demands a set of identity papers.Palmer tests Stok in order to determine how sincere he is about defecting. The test seems conclusive and Palmer returns to London. From Hallam (Hugh Burden), the documents manager back at MI5, Palmer receives documents in the name of Paul Louis Broum. As he places the envelope in his briefcase for return to Berlin, he notices the same name on the photocopy of Samantha's little black book, with the figure $2,000,000 next to it.Palmer returns to Samantha and makes a point of letting her see the envelope with Broum's name. Dropping all pretence, she admits that she is an Israeli agent. Broum is a Nazi war criminal who stole millions from the Jews during the war and hid it in a Swiss bank account. The Israelis need the papers in order to reclaim the money. Although she threatens to kill him, Palmer refuses to give her the documents since he needs them to pay Kreutzmann.Kreutzmann and his men murder an elderly East Berliner whose body is claimed by a relative in the West - actually someone employed by Kreutzmann. A body transfer is arranged but as the hearse makes its way from the morgue to the checkpoint, it is hijacked by Kreutzmann's men and replaced with another which contains a different coffin.The coffin is taken to West Berlin and delivered to an abandoned warehouse where Palmer and his associate Vulkan are waiting. But when the coffin in opened it is found to contain the dead body of Kreutzmann! Stok's whole defection was simply a bluff to lure Kreutzmann out and put an end to the escapes he so brilliantly organised. Although well informed, he and his men never knew in advance that Stok was the intended client.Before Palmer can get away from Kreutzmann's outraged accomplices, he is knocked unconscious by Vulkan who gets hold of the Broum documents only to be held up by Samantha and two other Israeli agents who take away the papers.Vulkan tells Palmer that he was knocked out by another of Kreutzmann's men. They then go to a safe house where British officials are waiting to debrief Stok. Stok of course is not there, meaning that a lot of valuable time and money has been wasted. Palmer's boss, Colonel Ross, is also present and Palmer tells him about the Broum documents. Ross was unaware that they were being used as part of the deal with Kreutzmann. He then reveals to Palmer that towards the end of the war, Paul Louis Broum, a guard at a concentration camp, murdered a resistance fighter called Johnny Vulkan and assumed his identity. Ross got hold of the documents and used them to blackmail Broum into working for him.Now that the documents are missing, Ross has nothing with which to keep a hold on Broum/Vulkan and cannot risk him defecting. He therefore orders Palmer to kill Broum. Palmer won't kill anyone in cold blood and allows Broum/Vulkan to get away.Back in West Berlin, Palmer meets Stok who is over for a routine meeting with his Western counterparts. The affable Russian confirms that his supposed defection was just a trap to get rid of Kreutzmann. He and Palmer even joke about the latter himself defecting to the East; Stok advises: ""If you need to get out in a hurry, ask Vulkan. He knows the way.""Meanwhile, Broum/Vulkan goes to Samantha's flat, murders an Israeli agent and gets the documents back. He then meets Hallam, the Intelligence official who gave Palmer the Broum documents in London. However, the documents that they now have are in fact forgeries made by one of Palmer's underworld Berlin contacts. Hallam goes to Palmer, saying that he has been sent by Ross to get the real documents back. Palmer never believed Hallam's claim that he selected the Broum documents at random and forces him to admit that he is in league with Broum: they took advantage of the situation to get the documents out of London and now intend to use them in order to claim the Nazi loot that Broum deposited in the Swiss banks.Palmer and Hallam go to a quiet part of the Berlin wall through which Broum and Hallam intend to slip into the East and thus to Switzerland, but Broum kills Hallam and makes away with the documents. However he is subsequently killed by the Israeli agents who were tailing Palmer. Palmer lets them take the genuine Broum documents.When Vulkan's body is discovered, Ross is satisfied that he will just be another martyr shot while escaping to the West. Palmer however turns down Ross's offer of a bonus for his work and leaves.By the time of the next film, Billion Dollar Brain (1967), Palmer has resigned from British Intelligence."
How to Steal a Million,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060522/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The daughter of an art forger teams up with a burglar to steal one of her father's forgeries and protect his secret. In Paris, wealthy Charles Bonnet is well known in the art world as a collector of rare pieces, mostly of the impressionist masters. He will on occasion sell paintings from his collection at auction. In reality, he is an art forger, he only reproducing those pieces known to have gone missing. His daughter, Nicole Bonnet, wants him to stop this business fearing that some day soon he will get caught. She is most concerned about he loaning out his Cellini Venus statue to the Kléber-Lafayette Museum, as she knows that technology can now test for things such as material age which would prove that the statue and by association he is a fraud. He ends up causing a problem for himself when he signs a $1 million insurance policy for the statue for the museum, which unwittingly allows them to test the piece for its authenticity. To save her father from jail, Nicole feels the only thing she can do is try to steal the statue from the gallery which may not be the easiest thing to do especially as the museum has installed an electronic security system around the piece to protect it above and beyond the regular security. She contacts the only person she knows who she believes can help her, namely a burglar named Simon Dermott. Nicole and Simon had only recently met when he broke into the Bonnet mansion to steal a Van Gogh painting, Nicole catching him in the process. Nicole could not call the police to report him for fear that her father's fraudulent life would be uncovered. Nicole not only has to convince Simon to help her without actually divulging the reason why she wants to steal her own statue, but they also have to come up with a plan to steal it. Complicating matters is an American art collector named Davis Leland who is not only wooing Nicole, but wants to add many of M. Bonnet's pieces to his own collection, most specifically the Venus. Within this collective, not all is as it appears on the surface.—Huggo Nicole's father, a legendary art collector, lends his prized Cellini Venus to a prestigious Paris museum. Unfortunately, the Venus was *not* sculpted by Cellini but by Nicole's grandfather. (Her father is a forger as well, but his specialty is paintings.) Before tests can be done which would prove the Venus a fake, Nicole enlists the services of ""society burglar"" Simon Demott to steal the million dollar statue.—A.L.Beneteau <albl@inforamp.net> Charles Bonnet, the latest in a long line of master art forgers, loans one of his best works, a faux Cellini Venus, to a Paris museum despite his daughter Nicole's objections. Later, Nicole surprises a tuxedo-clad burglar in her father's workshop. She can't call the police because her father's hobby might be discovered, so she ends up driving the man--Simon Dermott--back to his hotel. Dermott is actually an inspector who is gathering evidence against Bonnet, but his attraction to Nicole complicates the assignment. Nicole learns that the museum plans to conduct a test on the Venus for insurance purposes, which she knows will expose the statue as a fake. To save her father from jail, she asks Simon to steal it, unaware of his true identity. Simon, intrigued by the challenge and now smitten with Miss Bonnet, agrees to the proposal.—alfiehitchie Paris, 1966...Monsieur Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffin), the current head of the Bonnet family, custodian of the family's legendary collection of fine art, and a noted collector in his own right, is offering one of his prized paintings at auction. A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous $515,000, the high point of the auction. When Bonnet's daughter, Nicole (Audrey Hepburn), hears the news on her car radio on her way home from work, she is shocked...and dismayed. The moment she arrives at their elegant old chateau, she runs upstairs calling her father. In his bedroom on the second floor, she opens the door to an antique wardrobe and steps inside, opens a false panel at the back of the wardrobe and climbs a hidden spiral staircase to her father's secret studio in the attic.Bonnet, it turns out, is a forger of fine art...cheerful and charming, but an unrepentant scoundrel. He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. ""I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work,"" he boasts. ""He didn't have to, Papa,"" Nicole retorts, ""he WAS Van Gogh!"" She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces. He replies that he only sells them to wealthy, private buyers, who get an undeniably fine painting in return.A noise in the driveway sends them both to the window: An armored car, a police van, a black limousine and half a dozen motorcycles have arrived and parked in front of the house. Nicole is terrified that the authorities have at last discovered Bonnet's hobby, but Bonnet explains that he has simply agreed to let the Claver-Lafayette Museum display their exquisite statuette of Venus, purportedly carved by 16th Century sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, in their latest exhibit. Nicole is not reassured: Their Cellini Venus is also a forgery...carved at the end of the 19th century by Bonnet's father, using Bonnet's mother as a model. Unlike paintings, she tells her father, it's an easy matter to detect forged sculptures. Bonnet brushes aside her concerns: since he's merely lending the statue, not selling it, there will be no reason to test its authenticity.He runs downstairs (followed closely by Nicole) to greet Monsieur Grammont (Ferdinand Gravey), the museum director, who is here with his assistants and an armed escort to transport the Venus. Bonnet shows him into the library, where the Venus stands in solitary splendor in its own special niche. Grammont is moved almost to tears by the sight of it...he congratulates Bonnet for keeping this fine piece in France, though he must have had many lucrative offers to buy it. Bonnet smiles modestly, and says, ""Well, after all, one is still a Frenchman."" The Venus is handed over, secured in a heavily padded case, Grammont thanks Bonnet effusively and leaves. Bonnet is jubilant, but Nicole is still worried. He waves off her concern, saying that her basic trouble is that she's honest....""but I don't tell you that to hurt your feelings,"" he adds kindly. ""I get dizzy spells when we have these conversations, Papa,"" she complains. He invites her to attend the gala opening at the museum that night...she firmly declines.The Cellini Venus is the star of the exhibit, and Bonnet the most celebrated guest at the gala. Davis Leland (Eli Wallach), a wealthy American industrialist, is also present. He has recently taken up art collecting, and is pursuing it as obssessively as he pursued the acquisition of his millions. He is so taken with the Venus that he determines to find out all about Bonnet and his family...with the goal of somehow acquiring the Venus.The Bonnet chateau is dark and quiet...the only inhabitant is Nicole, lying upstairs on her bed in her nightie, engrossed in a lurid paperback mystery. Downstairs an intruder has gained entry, and is quietly creeping around the main floor, looking over all the paintings with a small flashlight. He stops when he finds Bonnet's new Van Gogh, takes it down from the wall, and chips off a minute particle of the paint. He tucks it into a little plastic envelope, and stows it in his pocket. He then starts to examine the painting, carefully. But he makes a slight noise, which Nicole hears upstairs, and she comes down to investigate. She gets halfway down the staircase, sees the intruder, and stifles a scream. Then she plucks up her courage and takes an antique duelling pistol from a display on the wall. She makes her way to the bottom of the stairs, levels the pistol in his direction and turns on the lights.Startled, holding the Van Gogh in front of himself like a shield, the burglar whirls around to face her. He (Peter O'Toole) is no ordinary burglar: he's tall, slim, blue-eyed, handsome, and very distinguished-looking in a dinner jacket. ""Don't move,"" she tells him, ""Put that painting down."" He does so, and she starts to call the police. Then she notices which painting he was holding. ""Why...did you choose that particular painting?"" she asks, uneasily. ""It was the handiest,"" he replies, promptly. He sees her hesitation, and decides to press his luck, a bit. ""Look..."" he says, ""don't call the police. Give me another chance. You see, I was only taking one painting...and you have so many...chances are you wouldn't even have noticed."" ""Don't be impudent,"" she scolds. But she can't afford to have official attention drawn toward her father's latest forgery. He puts the painting back, and she puts the phone down. ""Well, I don't know why,"" she says, ""but I'm going to let you go."" She sets the pistol down on the phone table, and as she does so it goes off, terrifying them both and grazing the burglar's arm. They both faint. He revives first, pats her cheek, fans her face with his coat tail, and when she awakens, he points out that he's the one who's bleeding.She takes him to the kitchen, pours him a drink and bandages his arm. He complains about the wound and the doctoring, even though it's only a minor scratch. ""For a burglar, you're not very brave,"" she remarks. ""I'm a society burglar,"" he retorts, ""I don't expect people to rush about shooting me."" She finishes patching him up, and tells him he is free to go. He continues to push her, though, as if he's trying to see how far he can go before she finally loses patience and calls the police. He tells her he won't be able to drive home, with his wounded arm. Exasperated, she offers to call a cab...and pay for it. He points out that his car is outside her house, and the police may ask questions...and after all, he is wanted. She finally agrees to drive him home, and while she's pulling on her boots, and putting a coat on over her nightie, he asks her for a cigarette...and then a match...all while openly admiring her legs.They jump into his little yellow Jaguar, and she drives him to the Hotel Ritz (""You're a very chic burglar,"" she grumbles). Then she realizes she's on foot, in her nightie, in downtown Paris, in the middle of the night...with no way of getting home herself. He has the doorman wave down a taxi for her, and while it's turning around, he asks her for a final favor. ""Like an idiot,"" he says, ""I forgot to wear gloves. Would you just give the edge of the painting a quick wipe with a clean cloth, when you get home?"" She stares at him in disbelief. ""Oh, you're mad,"" she says. ""I suppose next you'll want a goodnight kiss."" ""Well, I don't, usually, on the first acquaintance,"" he replies, ""but you've been such a good sport...."" And he lays a lovely one on her that leaves her stunned and speechless. He puts her gently in the cab, bids her good night, and waves as they drive off. Simon Dermott, ""society burglar"", hurries upstairs to his room, takes out the tiny spot of paint he chipped from the Van Gogh, and examines it with a set of jeweler's glasses. He lights a cigarette, thinking...and smiles, remembering.Bonnet is at home pouring a glass of champagne when Nicole walks in. He starts to tell her of the gala...she interrupts and tells him about the burglar she caught. He quickly grasps the implications of what might have happened had she called the police, and assures her she did the right thing in letting the burglar go. Still somewhat dazed, she starts up to bed, then pauses...she takes Bonnet's handkerchief from his pocket, wipes the edge of the painting with it, and tucks it back into Bonnet's pocket, while he watches, a little bewildered. She starts back up the stairs, and he asks her, uneasily, ""This tall, good-looking ruffian...he didn't molest you in any way, did he?"" She stops, considers, then replies softly, ""Not much,"" and continues on up to bed.Next day she goes to the museum to see the Venus in the exhibit for herself. She turns to leave, and almost bumps into Simon Dermott. Startled and indignant, she is trying to get rid of him when Monsieur Grammont sees her, and comes over to greet her. Simon horns in, introducing himself as an old shooting partner of Miss Bonnet's. Monsieur Grammont offers to tell her about the special security arrangements they've made. Nicole tries to disengage, but Simon expresses interest, so Monsieur Grammont launches into an explanation. The little statue stands on a marble pedestal, with a circuit of infrared beams surrounding her. If anyone tries to reach through the invisible barrier to grab her, an alarm sounds, and both museum security and police respond. Simon wants to linger and hear more, but Nicole drags him away, out of the museum. Outside she tells him to go away, and leave her alone. He tries to talk to her, but she speeds off in her little car so quickly he spins around and almost falls in the street.Simon arrives at the office of Monsieur Bernard Desolnay (Charles Boyer), a well-known and reputable dealer of fine art. Desolnay greets him with enthusiasm, and asks if he had a chance to go to Bonnet's home and look at the Van Gogh. Simon nodds, and Desolnay says, ""And it bothers you, doesn't it?"" ""Not a bit,"" replies Simon, ""it's a great Van Gogh."" ""Of course it is,"" agrees Desolnay readily, ""But who painted it?"" It develops that Desolnay has suspected Bonnet for some time. Simon points out that he has a statue worth a million dollars on exhibit...he certainly doesn't need the money. Desolnay speculates that it has more to do with ego: Bonnet studied painting as a young man, and like many art students, copied the Old Masters to learn their secrets. In the process he must have learned that he could imitate them perfectly, and now he enjoys fooling the world. Simon wonders idly if Nicole is in it with him. Desolnay replies, ""In what? According to you there's nothing."" ""Oh, that's right,"" says Simon, catching himself. ""Well, you're wrong, you'll see,"" declares Desolnay.Later, Bonnet enters Nicole's bedroom, and asks about her plans for the evening. She tells him she has a date with Davis Leland, an American tycoon she met that day. Bonnet is surprised and interested. He tells her that Leland once bought a Toulouse Lautrec painting from him. ""Your Lautrec or Lautrec's Lautrec?"" she asks, warily. ""Mine, of course,"" he chuckles. Nicole is instantly uneasy again: Not only had Davis not mentioned that fact, but he had behaved as though he'd never heard of her father, and had no interest in art at all. She fears he must be up to something...or suspects something.They dine at an upscale restaurant. Davis is quite taken with Nicole...he sometimes has trouble relating to women, he tells her...but she's just like a member of the board. He's called to the phone, and as soon as he's out of sight, Simon (who apparently had him paged) sits down at the table. She is suitably annoyed, but he tells her he must talk to her, and gives her his room number at the Ritz. Then he leaves, and Davis returns. Davis finally admits to Nicole that he arranged their meeting because of his interest in the Cellini Venus, and hoped she could help him acquire it. Relieved, she kisses him, and tells him it's not for sale...but if it was hers to sell, it would be his in a heartbeat.Next morning, she tells her father of the exchange, and they share a short-lived moment of relief. The butler (Bert Bertram) announces that a representative from the museum (Eddie Malin) has arrived. It seems that the museum has arranged to insure the Venus against damage or theft while it's on exhibit. Monsieur Grammont was supposed to have gotten Bonnet's signature on an insurance form the day he picked it up, but had neglected to do so, and he is here to correct the oversight. When Bonnet has signed the papers, the representative asks if he'd like to be present at the technical examination, which he has just authorized. ""Technical...examination?"" Nicole and Bonnet ask in unison, dumbfounded. ""Yes,"" replies the representative. ""A mere formality, of course...It will take place on Friday, and you have the right to be present."" He leaves, unaware of the bomb he has dropped on their world.The myth of the Bonnet collection is about to be exploded. Once the Venus is exposed as a forgery, anything else that has been bought, owned or sold by Bonnet will be tested and retested until every forged piece is brought to light. Bonnet urges Nicole to leave the country and let him face the scandal alone. But she refuses, determined to stand by him, and as she comforts him, an idea occurs to her. She asks him for the number of the Hotel Ritz.Simon enters the bar at the Ritz, and walks right by Nicole, who is ""disguised"" in a black lace cocktail dress and a little black pillbox hat, with black net veil and domino-style mask attached. She ""Pssst's"" at him, and motions him back to her table. He's astonished by her odd appearance and behavior...and stunned when she asks him to help her steal the Venus. He wants to know why, but she steadfastly refuses to tell him, and at first, he emphatically refuses. But she is so heartbroken, so desperate (and so lovely), he can't bring himself to refuse her out of hand. He tells her he'll sleep on it. They agree to meet the next day to talk it over.Next day, they drive to the museum...he points out that there is a formidable presence of museum guards, and even more guards at the homes of the Minister of the Interior and the President, across the street. They go inside, and as he studies the security set-up, he notices a resemblance between Nicole and the Venus. ""Where were you in the middle of the 15th Century?"" he asks. ""I don't know,"" she retorts, ""but that's not how I was dressed,"" gesturing at the nude statue. He continues his reconnaissance. He notes that parcels are not permitted in the museum: they must be left at a desk in the lobby, but they are not searched...that there is a tapestry hanging on a frame in front of a fireplace...that there is a small utility closet at the bottom of the main staircase, the door of which is locked, but the key is kept on a hook at the back of the staircase. Exploring, he finds the guards' room, and goes inside. Posing as an official from the Ministry of Tourism, and asking indignant questions under the pretense that his sleeve became smeared with dust in the museum, he learns that the cleaning people come in every night at midnight. On his way out, he deliberately chooses the wrong door, and sees that it leads to the basement, and a possible alternate exit.They go for a walk in a nearby park. He sees a child's toy being demonstrated, a balsa-wood boomerang that soars in a circle, then returns to the thrower. He buys two. They stop at a second-hand shop, for a scrubwoman's outfit, and a plastic mop bucket. When they go back to his room at the Ritz, he tells Nicole to change into the clothes. Tired of following him on endless and seemingly unrelated errands, irritated at having no explanation as to what he is thinking, Nicole asks him suspiciously if they're planning the same sort of crime. Nevertheless, she puts on the clothes, and he starts to tell her what will happen at midnight in the museum. ""You DO have a plan, don't you!"" she exclaims, excited. ""Yes,"" he replies evenly. ""My plan is that I will be lying here in my bed with a good book, unless you tell me what this is all about."" She's surprised and crestfallen...but she can't explain, so he tells her she must go. Tears fill her eyes, and he angrily tells her they won't change his mind. He orders her back into the bathroom to change out of the clothes, and leave. As she turns dejectedly to do so, against his better judgment, he tells her to meet him at the museum just before closing the following day. Overjoyed, she agrees, and almost skips into the bathroom. Simon hits himself in the head with the plastic mop bucket.Next evening, just as Nicole is preparing to leave for the museum, Davis Leland turns up at her house with an enormous diamond ring, and in a very efficient and business-like manner, asks her to marry him. Afraid that refusing him will mean argument and delay, she takes the ring and dashes away, arriving at the museum only a few minutes late. Simon is impatient and irritated...she explains to him that she was getting engaged, and he retorts that they still have a little time if she'd like to go back and marry the man.They check the parcel of clothes at the desk, and go on into the museum. He checks on the closet, and quickly unlocks the door. Then he takes a handful of coins, and puts them in a brochure, and places the brochure precariously on the edge of a statue's pedestal. ""Watch for normal human reactions,"" he says to Nicole, and they move over by the fireplace. A guard picks up the brochure, and the coins scatter...several people bend down to pick them up, while many others watch. Simon and Nicole use the distraction to duck into the fireplace behind the tapestry. The museum closes and as the guards escort the other patrons out, they slip down the stairs and into the tiny closet. The guards return and make a round of all the floors. One of the guards finds the closet unlocked, gives it a cursory inspection (slim Nicole and slim Simon have both squeezed into a tiny shelf area), then locks the door and returns the key to the outside panel. Nicole panics, but Simon is unconcerned. They wait for an hour in the tiny closet. Then they hear the guards come out of their room, and tramp all over the museum again as they make their rounds. Simon is pleased: now he knows the schedule.Using a powerful magnet against the wall at the back of the closet, he is able to remove the key from its hook, ""walk"" it around the outside of the closet, and bring it inside under the door. With a specially-fitted tube, a hook, and another small magnet, he's able to draw the key up into the keyhole, and open the door. He runs to the front desk, grabs the clothes and runs back to the closet. He helps Nicole to put the clothes on over her own clothes, then he takes out and assembles one of the little boomerangs he'd bought the day before. Exasperated at the close quarters (""I hadn't counted on there being so much togetherness,"" she grumbles) and all the elaborate preparations, Nicole asks when they're finally going to steal the Venus. He tells her that one of the nice things about complicated mechanical systems is that they malfunction, and when that happens, you can always rely on normal human reactions. He asks her how she would feel if she was one of these guards, assigned to look out for a bunch of stuff she couldn't afford, and wasn't interested in, night after night. ""Irritated,"" she replies, wearily. ""Exactly,"" he says, and steps out of the closet onto the stairway.His first throw goes wide...but his second breaks the beam on the electric field surrounding the Venus, and a deafening alarm goes off. He grabs the returning boomerang and Nicole, and they both run back to the closet. The guards pour out of their room, and swarm all over the museum, and when the police arrive, they search as well. It's eventually determined that the alarm was false. The Minister of the Interior calls to complain about the noise from across the street. The head guard (Jacques Marin), a short, serious man, looks disgusted. ""A burglar alarm especially designed to give me heartburn,"" he mutters, as he resets it.Nicole realizes, for the first time, what a difficult and dangerous task they've undertaken. She tells Simon she wouldn't blame him if he left. ""Then what happens tomorrow when they test your million dollar baby?"" he asks quietly. She stares at him. ""It's a fake, isn't it,"" he says. She nods slowly, and asks how long he's known, and he answers: ""Since you first asked me to steal it."" She asks why he'd help if he knew...he leans in and kisses her gently, and she whispers, ""That's why,"" in wonder. ""Oh, I'm so stupid,"" she says, putting her arms around his neck. ""Please...explain it to me again!""After more ""explanation"", he goes out to set off the alarm a second time. Again, the lights go on, the guards gallop all over the museum, and the police arrive to assist...again, they find nothing. This time, it is ""His Excellency"" himself who calls up from across the street to complain. The head guard is properly intimidated. He doesn't reset the alarm...he turns it off.Simon is stunned to find that his plan has worked. Nevertheless, he pulls himself together, and attends to business. He goes up the stairs and takes the Venus, and conceals it in the bucket. He tells Nicole to hide in the fireplace again, and when the scrubwomen arrive, to come out on her hands and knees, scrubbing madly, and no matter whatever else happens to work her way back to the guard's room. ""The guards' room?"" she asks. ""When they discover the Venus is gone, there will be guards everywhere but in the guards' room,"" he says, and tells her to hang onto her bucket.At midnight, the scrubwomen arrive, and set to work. The guards also come out, and start rounds. It is several minutes before a guard (Mustache) notices that the Venus is gone. He points it out to the head guard, who is shocked insensible for a long moment. Then he hoarsely cries, ""Alarm!"" --and all hell breaks loose, with guards running every which way, bumping into each other, and stumbling over scrubwomen. It is a few moments more before the head guard realizes that the alarm is not sounding...because it has been turned off. He quickly turns it on again, but it is still silent. Mustache finally reaches through the beam, and the alarm goes off, adding to the bedlam.Nicole has worked her way to the guard room, and goes inside. One of the guards is there, sitting in a chair, reading a newspaper. She turns to flee, but he grabs her and kisses her...it's Simon. They leave quietly down the basement stairs.Reporters gather at Bonnet's house next morning, to take pictures of the empty niche, and ask him how he feels about the loss of his precious statue. He plays his feigned grief to the hilt. Upstairs, Nicole is chatting excitedly with Simon about the caper on the phone, and they arrange to meet later at the Ritz bar. The reporters leave, and Nichol runs downstairs, and she and her father hug joyously in their relief. He offers to take her out to celebrate, but she tells him she has an appointment later, at the Ritz. She runs back upstairs, and he repeats, ""The Ritz,"" looking thoughtful.Davis Leland has come to Monsieur Desolnay's office, in a state of extreme excitement. He wants to try and find the Venus, and purchase it...at any price...no questions asked. Desolnay implores him not to pursue it, but finally gives him the name of someone he thinks may be able to help: Simon Dermott, currently staying at the Ritz.They meet at the bar in the Ritz, and Simon tells Davis that he already has a few feelers out...just idle curiosity...and he believes he knows who might be responsible. He warns Davis he'll be buying something that he will never be able to show, or even to acknowledge that he owns. Davis is undeterred. Simon asks if Davis is acquainted with any member of the Bonnet familly, and Davis admits he's engaged to Bonnet's daughter. Simon tells him that if he wants the Venus, he'll have to give her up...that if he doesn't, the people who have the Venus will suspect a trap and he'll never be able to acquire it. Reluctantly, Davis agrees. Simon says he'll be in touch, and Davis starts to leave the bar...just as Nicole arrives. As Simon watches, amused, Davis almost breaks a leg avoiding her, when she's only trying to return his ring.She sits down next to Simon, and begins to chatter about how thrilling the theft had been, for her first effort. ""It was my first, too,"" he remarks. This admission stops her in mid-sentence. She asks, puzzled, ""Then you're not a burglar?"" He shakes his head. ""Who are you?"" she asks, filled with sudden foreboding. ""I'm a private consultant who specializes in museum security,"" he says, deliberately. ""I have advanced degrees in art history, chemistry and criminology. I also specialize in tracing and recovering stolen works of art, and in detecting and exposing forgeries."" She is so startled and dismayed she almost falls out of the booth. But he catches her, and at that moment Bonnet himself arrives, having correctly deduced the nature of Nicole's appointment. After Nicole introduces them, he asks what Simon intends to do. Simon replies that Bonnet has two gorgeous girls in his family...and he intends to keep the real one. But he has plans for the other girl as well, and he must leave now to make arrangements. After his departure, Nicole lets out a shocked little scream: Davis Leland's huge diamond ring is gone, too!Simon meets Davis at the airport, preparing to take off in his private jet. He hands Davis a crate, and tells him that he'll be contacted later for payment: the code word will be ""togetherness"". Davis takes the crate into the jet, and hurries directly to the restroom, where he can be alone. There, he opens the crate, removes the packing and reveals the Venus, in all its illicit splendor. Then, to his wonder, he notices that the diamond ring he gave to Nicole is tied with a bit of ribbon around the Venus's neck.Bonnet is delighted...Davis is the only collector who will never dare to have the statue tested. He asks, rather tentatively, about the money Simon got for the piece...Simon says he asked a nice round figure, and traces a large zero in the air with his index finger. ""You, sir, are a forger,"" he says. ""It's my job to catch forgers. One of us has to retire."" ""Fair enough,"" says Bonnet, ""Shall we flip a coin?"" ""I already did,"" replies Simon, ""You lost."" Bonnet struggles with himself for a moment, then extends his hand to seal the bargain.Nicole and Simon are leaving France...they'll lie low for a while in England, and get married there. As they drive through Bonnet's front gate, another car passes them on the way in...a Senor Paravideo (Marcel Dalio) who has long been trying to get hold of one of Bonnet's paintings. Simon stops the little yellow Jag, and he and Nicole turn to watch. Bonnet greets Paravideo with delight, and shows him inside. ""Who's that?"" asks Simon, pointedly. Nicole's hesitation is very brief: ""Papa's cousin,"" she replies, innocently, ""from South America."" He looks at her for a long time, then remarks, ""For someone who only started lying recently, you're showing a real flair for it."" ""Oh, thank you!"" she says, smiling radiantly. And they're off. And they all live happily ever after!"

Fantastic Voyage,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060397/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a blood clot renders a scientist comatose, a submarine and its crew are shrunk and injected into his bloodstream in order to save him. Scientist Jan Benes (Jean Del Val), who knows the secret to keeping soldiers shrunken for an indefinite period, escapes from behind the Iron Curtain with the help of C.I.A. Agent Grant (Stephen Boyd). While being transferred, their motorcade is attacked. Benes strikes his head, causing a blood clot to form in his brain. Grant is ordered to accompany a group of scientists as they are miniaturized. They have one hour to get to Benes' brain, remove the clot, and get out.—Brian Washington <Sargebri@att.net> The battle being waged by the super powers is who can perfect miniaturization. Now both sides are stumped as to how to control it. So far, they can miniaturize anything, but up to sixty minutes only. Scientist Jan Benes (Jean Del Val), who is believed to have solved it, was about to give it to the Americans when an attempt is made on his life. Fortunately, he is not dead, but he is in a coma and any conventional means to operate on him could be fatal. So a plan is made to miniaturize a vessel, send a team of doctors into his body, and that they will go to the damaged area and fix it. The problem is that there is a report that someone on the team could be working for the other side. So they send C.I.A. Agent Grant (Stephen Boyd) to make sure everything goes okay.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Brilliant scientist Jan Benes (Jean Del Val) develops a way to shrink humans and other objects for brief periods of time.

In order to save him, who has developed a blood clot in his brain, a team of Americans in a nuclear submarine is shrunk and injected into his body. They have sixty minutes to fix the clot and get out before the miniaturization wears off.—Jwelch5742 A commercial airliner lands at JFK Airport in New York. A Secret Serviceman (Ken Scott), backed by a large Army contingent, greets the plane. After it taxis to a stop, Lieutenant Charles Grant USN (Stephen Boyd) steps out onto a mobile boarding ramp, verifies the Secret Service escort, and then signals to the other passenger, Jan Benes (Jean Del Val), to deplane with him. Benes walks down and gets into the Secret Service car, but not before warmly shaking Grant's hand one last time.But as the motorcade enters a run-down section of New York, a car hurtles out of an alley and broadsides Benes' car. Hastily the Secret Service transfer Benes to another car, which then must make a quick escape as the Secret Service contingent fights a gun battle with several other assailants in the surrounding buildings.Benes is taken to the underground headquarters of the Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces (CMDF) and given a full physical examination, including an EEG. The results are dire: he has suffered a stroke on the left side, in an inoperable spot. The doctors induce a coma so that his brain will not damage itself, while they decide what to do.The original Secret Service man then picks up Grant and delivers him to an alley, instructing him to stay in the car and wait. Then the car, with Grant alone in it, descends to an underground complex. A small scooter bearing the CMDF logo, which he does not recognize, picks him up and delivers him to the Medical Section. There, Grant meets CMDF's commandant, Lieutenant General Alan Carter USA (Edmund O'Brien). General Carter first shows him Benes, in a coma and on a litter. Then he introduces him to the surgeon, Dr. Peter Duval (Arthur Kennedy), and his assistant Cora Peterson (Raquel Welch), who will operate on Benes, and also to Dr. ""Mike"" Michaels (Donald Pleasence), who is somehow expected to watch Duval to make sure that Duval does not try to kill his patient while operating. Then Carter explains what CMDF means, and about the miniaturization technique that is at the heart of it all. The problem: the USA (and the USSR) can miniaturize any object, to any size, but cannot hold an object miniaturized for more than 60 minutes. Benes knows how to extend the time, and Grant is the one who brought Benes out when he sought to defect. Now Carter reveals why Grant is there: CMDF will reduce a small submarine to microscopic size, and deliver Duval, Miss Peterson, Michaels--and Grant--into Benes' body, to operate on Benes from the inside.Grant hates the idea. Worse yet, CMDF Medical Officer Col. Donald Reid (Arthur O'Connell) does not want a woman to go along on such a hazardous mission. Duval insists that he will have Cora or no one at his side. Grant also meets Captain Wilfrid Owens (William Redfield), designer and pilot of the submarine. The plan: reduce the submarine with all aboard and inject it into the left carotid artery. They will follow this to the site of the stroke, where Dr. Duval will use a hand-held laser to dissolve the clot. Then they travel back along the left internal jugular to the base of the neck, where they will be removed. The problem: if they stay in longer than 60 minutes, they will grow to a size that the immune system will notice, and Benes' own defenses will mobilize to destroy them.Grant barely has time to take in a briefing before Michaels leads him, Duval, Cora, and Owens to a ""sterilization room."" There they dress in white SCUBA wetsuits, with white overalls over this, all bearing the CMDF logo, and pass through a corridor that irradiates them gently with UVA to kill any germs on their bodies. As Carter and Reid make their preparations, the crew then climbs aboard their submarine (USS Proteus, U-91035) and make preparations for getting under way. Owens and Grant install a tiny reactor containing a microscopic radioactive particle, that will power the sub once they are shrunk. (Radioactive material cannot miniaturize.) Grant tests the ship's wireless, which will be his station. Owens tells Michaels how he will be able to read Michaels' details charts of Benes' circulatory and lymphatic systems. Cora mounts and tests the laser, while also teasing Grant about his still-obvious fear of being ""shrunk."" (Grant has, throughout, tried to cover his fear with bad jokes and worse innuendo, and doesn't fool Cora for one second.) Cora also reveals that she is a five-year veteran of CMDF and has worked with Duval all that time.Carter radios them to ""prepare for miniaturization."" So the crew pull out their seats, strap in, and settle in. Everything goes well, except for the time that Michaels, suffering an attack of claustrophobia, tries to get out through the topside hatch (after they are already submerged in an outsized hypodermic syringe), forcing Duval and Grant to restrain him and calm him down. (Duval and Grant have taken their first shot at working together, as they cooperate with Owens to accomplish the submersion.) With the second miniaturization step, the Proteus can now generate its own power. Eventually, the surgical team injects them into the carotid artery.And then the problems begin. At first the view is fascinating, But then Proteus drifts into a strong current, then into a whirlpool. It catches the crew unaware, so that though Michaels and Duval can regain their seats, Grant and Cora cannot. Michaels' shoulder belts pop, and Duval struggles to hold him in. Cora is dragged into a bulkhead, and only Grant's iron grip on her stops her from breaking her neck. Finally the Proteus comes out of the whirlpool--but now the blood cells surrounding them are blue, not the red they remembered. They realize (as do Carter and Reid, watching from outside) that Proteus has gone through an arterio-venous fistula from the carotid artery into the jugular vein. Now they are headed toward the superior vena cava, and will go through the heart--which will smash them. Michaels urges immediate removal, but the authorities, under Carter's leadership, have another idea: to put Benes into cardiac arrest and let Proteus swim through as fast as her drive can propel her. This they do, and Proteus dives into the right ventricle and goes out through the pulmonic valve, with three seconds to spare.Now they head into the lungs, where they observe oxygenation of the blue corpuscles that surround them. Just then, Proteus develops an air leak, which Owens stops, but only after Proteus has lost so much air that she cannot continue. Grant offers a solution: he will take the boat's snorkel and enter an alveolus to take the air that Benes breathes. Owens insists that everyone else aboard except himself join Grant in the dive, for safety reasons. As they put on their SCUBA gear, Grant discovers that the laser has broken loose and gotten knocked around. He firmly tells Duval and Cora to wait on testing the laser until after Grant finishes his snorkel operation.Grant succeeds in pulling in the air--but then his safety line snaps and he finds himself sucked into a bronchiole with Benes' next breathe-out. When Benes breathes in again, he luckily finds the original alveolus, after which he races to safety, with Duval strenuously pulling him back out into the bloodstream.Proteus gets back underway, heading into the pleural cavity. During this time, Cora disassembles the laser and discovers a smashed transistor and a broken trigger wire. Grant supplies replacements for both by cannibalizing the wireless and sending one last message, to the consternation of Carter and Reid. The transistor is of a good size, but the trigger wire is far too large--but Duval believes that he can scrape it down.Grant also takes time to discuss with Michaels a hard reality: someone has tried to sabotage the mission at least twice. Grant knows that Cora had indeed fastened the laser securely--so someone must have unfastened it, just as someone tampered with Grant's safety line. Michaels protests that he cannot think so ill of Duval, the logical suspect.Proteus enters the lymphatic system and passes through a lymph node. The boat blunders into several reticular fibers, and Owens warns that if they keep running into the seaweed-like fibers, they'll block the water jet intakes, and Proteus' engines will overheat. The crew also observe a stray bacterium, and antibodies attacking it and squeezing it to death.Grant is frustrated with the delay and the slow progress. Duval then suggests going to the inner ear--a very hazardous path, because the slightest noise will kill them, and they cannot warn the operating team. Grant expresses confidence that the surgical team, once they see where they are headed, will keep the required silence. Michaels is still dubious, but reluctantly agrees to navigate to Benes' left ear.Inside the ear, Owens must stop--the engines have overheated. Grant, Cora, and Michaels make another dive to pull the reticular fibers out of the intakes. Topside, a nurse (Shelby Grant) gets the idea of plugging Benes' ear with cotton--but then drops a pair of scissors to the floor. With the result that Proteus and her crew are badly shaken up. Cora gets the worst of it--she is carried into the Organ of Corti and finds herself trapped among the Cells of Hensen. She cries out for help, and Michaels and Grant race to her rescue--but Grant orders Michaels back aboard Proteus when he cannot go any further. Grant frees Cora from the hair cells, and they race back to the airlock--but as they wait for it to re-flood (after Michaels used it), antibodies attack Cora and fasten onto her. Grant hastily guides her into the airlock, closes the hatch--and then raps on the door when Cora makes plain that she simply cannot breathe. Michaels, Duval, and Owens open the airlock before it is fully evacuated, pull Cora out, and, with Grant's help, start pulling the antibody molecules off her body. Soon they start crystallizing and come off easily, so Cora is saved.Proteus gets back under way, passes through the middle ear, and then passes through the endolymphatic duct back into the vascular system. Now they penetrate into the brain and reach the clot. During that passage, Michaels and Duval argue about whether Duval, having repaired the laser, should test it. Duval insists on using the laser as-is, not wanting to strain it.Eventually they reach the clot. But with so little time remaining, Michaels wants Owens to take Proteus back out. But now Grant shuts down the power and insists that Duval and Cora go out and operate. Michaels strenously objects, but Grant firmly overrides him, saying that Duval simply does not fit the profile of a fanatic.Now Grant makes his near-fatal mistake: instead of remaining aboard, he goes out to see if he can ""help"" Duval and Cora. Duval manages to clear the clot, at least enough to get the blood flowing again and relieve the pressure on a key nerve. But aboard Proteus, Michaels knocks out Owens, and then restores power, takes the helm, and sends Proteus on a collision course for the nerve. Grant asks for the laser, and fires a wide-angle beam at Proteus, raking her port side and sending her away from the nerve and into several nearby dendrites. White corpuscles respond immediately, so Grant slips back aboard, through the tear in the hull, to rescue Michaels and Owens if he can. Owens is only now regaining consciousness, so Grant tells him to suit up as fast as he can. But when he tries to untangle Michaels from the wrecked helm station, a white cell settles over the helmsman's dome, breaks through, and suffocates Michaels. Grant and Owens then abandon ship, before the white corpuscles crush it. Duval keeps the white cells at bay long enough for Grant and Owens to escape, before the laser quits for good.Topside, Carter and Reid reluctantly order the removal of Proteus, because time has run out. Inside Benes' body, the four remaining crew swim as fast as they can along the optic nerve, toward Benes' left eye. Carter allows the attending surgeon to make preparations for a trephination procedure--and then deduces what the crew might do and stops the attending in mid-motion. Reid, too, realizes how they crew can still escape, and rushes down to the operating room and asks for a large magnifier. Through this, he looks into Benes' left eye, in time to make out four members of the crew swimming in Benes' tears. He calls for a microscope slide and uses it to lift out a teardrop, with the crew inside. Then he asks the staff to open the door, and as quickly as he dares, walks out into the miniaturization room and sets the slide gently down on the center hexagon. The crew then grows to full size, and the rest of the staff warmly greet them and assure them that the operation is a complete success.NOTE: The film, as it played, had a number of scientific inaccuracies and plot holes. Isaac Asimov, who wrote the novelization from the final shooting script, repaired these and at least tried to produce a scientifically consistent narrative. The key differences are:* The time limit on miniaturization is not a uniform sixty minutes. Instead, the rule is that energy of miniaturization (which is a function of the proportion of normal size to reduced size), when multiplied by duration of miniaturization, is equal to Planck's constant divided by two times pi. In simpler terms, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle governs the maximum time of miniaturization at any given size. Benes' secret is another set of variables that the original pioneering scientists overlooked. The sixty minutes that apply to this narrative are a special case of that model.* Grant's role and authority are broader than as depicted in the film version. In the novel, Grant, not Michaels, has the ultimate authority on policy decisions, and is another brain and pair of hands in an emergency. Cora, sensing right away that the CMDF brass put him on board because they suspect Duval of murderous intent, at first resents him bitterly, and then softens toward him and almost pleads with him to understand Duval's politics, that have caused CMDF to doubt him. Those politics are that the Two Sides in the Cold War ought to share scientific discoveries freely, without regard to strategic sensitivity. But Duval is not the saboteur, a thing Grant comes to deduce by process of elimination.* When Grant makes his first dive with the snorkel into Benes' lungs, Owens uses the on-board miniaturizer that Proteus carries, to reduce the air to a size compatible with Proteus and her crew in their shrunken state. Otherwise, Grant would have been trying to draw in oxygen molecules large enough to see.* When Grant's safety line parts, sending him up the bronchiolar tree, Duval suggests that Owens orient the Proteus to face the alveolar wall and shine the boat's headlight into it. That allows Grant to find the right alveolus again. Otherwise he would have been hopelessly lost.* As Carter and Reid watch Proteus enter the inner ear, they do not use their PA system to announce to the surgical team the hazard against making noise. Instead, Carter writes a note and sends an orderly to walk into the OR in his stockinged feet to hand it to the attending. When, later, he wants to suggest plugging Benes' ears, he sends another note the same way. (The nurse does not take that upon herself, but acts only when she gets Carter's second note. And when the scissors fall, she steps on them so that they won't rattle and thus risk more damage than they might already have caused.)* When Cora falls into the organ of Corti and finds herself wedged among the hair cells, the antibodies take time to ""taste"" her before they come swarming. Benes' body would never have had antibodies specific to her at the moment of contact. This is still a stretch, because the immune system is now known to take much longer than that to raise antibodies to anything, and through a process that is much more complex than that depicted in film or novel.* When the crew pull Cora back aboard, they only have to give one good tug at one clinging antibody molecule, before realizing that all the antibodies crystallize at once, and all they need do is brush them off. The air on board ""hits"" the antibodies and denatures them immediately. So the dramatic (and suggestive) grabbing procedure is not necessary.* When Duval and Cora make their dive to attack the clot with the laser, Cora wears her wetsuit inside out, in order not to present a recognizable target to any stray antibodies that might be lurking about. Benes might not have been ""immunized"" against her before, but he is now.* After clubbing Owens, Michaels, unaccountably, bundles him into a wet suit and drops him out the airlock. Perhaps Michaels takes no chances that Owens might come to himself and try to take his ship back. With the result that Grant's quick rescue operation becomes unnecessary.* After the Proteus crashes into the dendrites, Duval worries that the damage that Michaels has done might start a new clot. This apparently does not happen, but at least Asimov acknowledges the possibility, which the original script does not even talk about.* After the white corpuscles eat the Proteus, Grant knows that they can't just leave her in place. Even when crushed, Proteus will grow to a size to kill Benes. (Michaels also realizes this at the last instant of his life, which is why he bursts out laughing as the white corpuscle collapses the glass dome over his head.) So Grant takes out his dagger and slashes at the white cell to attract its attention and induce it to follow them out. Of course, that releases chemotaxins that bring a swarm of white cells, so the crew must swim for their lives to get out ahead of them. (Furthermore, the medical team topside do not stop tracking Proteus even as they prepare for the trephination procedure. When the monitoring techs realize that Proteus seems to be moving again, Carter stops the preparations. That's when Reid realizes that the crew are using an escape route he did not at first consider.)* The crew, swimming toward the eye, do not drop the laser. Instead, Cora tries to carry the laser out. When Cora inevitably starts flagging, Grant takes the laser and its power pack away from her so that she can swim unencumbered.* Finally, when Col. Reid extracts the crew, he does not try to walk with the slide into the miniaturizer room. Instead, he sets the slide on the operating-room floor where he stands and orders everyone out of the room, including Benes, whom the staff wheel out on his litter. When the crew re-magnify, General Carter takes a quick muster with his eyes and realizes, with a sickening feeling in his gut, that Michaels and the Proteus are both missing. Grant stops him and assures him that the pile of metal fragments next to the crew is what's left of both.The novel has a few more dramatic differences--offering a more detailed explanation of the science of miniaturization, and making more of the professional (or personal) relationships between General Carter and Colonel Reid, between Reid and Michaels, between Grant and Benes on the flight in, between Duval and Cora, and especially between Cora and Grant during and after the trip. (See above.) Grant also has a scene with Carter and Reid in which he acknowledges his mistake in going out on the dive with Duval and Cora, instead of remaining on board after he, in effect, had placed Michaels under arrest. The novel ends with an inspiring scene in which Grant, fully grown once more, pays a visit to Benes, who by now has regained consciousness and can even talk to him.BENES: And now I must remember what I came here to tell. It's a little fuzzy, but it's still all in there.GRANT: You'd be surprised to know what's in you, Professor."

They rip off older men, feast in lavish meals and do all kinds of mischief. But what is all this leading to? After realizing that all world is spoiled, blond Marie and brunette Marie are committed to be spoiled themselves. Their life motto is: Nothing is bad as long as you are having fun. They rip off older men, feast in lavish meals and do all kinds of mischief. But what is all this leading to?—Martin Brachvogel Marie 1 and Marie 2 don't give a hoot about traditional morals and social norms and seduce the men who are attracted to their carefree exuberance - mostly older men - with ease. They prey on their suitors' purses and simply try to enjoy any fun that comes their way. Their escapades are a game played by the two boastful Maries as they plunge blindly from one adventure to the next. But their ""depraved"" nature - as highlighted at the end by a moral underlined by Vera Chytilova - is just an innocent rebellion against the backdrop of a troubled modern world. The protagonists of ""Sedmikrásky"" - embodied by the amateur actresses Jitka Cerhova and Ivana Karbanova - serve primarily as a demonstration of female liberation in the sense of the feminist currents of the time. The two Maries stand - albeit in an extreme form - for women struggling to survive in a man's world. Two teenage girls, both named Marie, decide that since the world is spoiled they will be spoiled as well; accordingly they embark on a series of destructive pranks in which they consume and destroy the world about them. This freewheeling, madcap feminist farce was immediately banned by the government.—Fiona Kelleghan <fkelleghan@aol.com>"

The Blue Max,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060177/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young pilot in the German air force of 1918, disliked as lower-class and unchivalrous, tries ambitiously to earn the medal offered for 20 kills. The tactics of a German fighter pilot offend his aristocratic comrades but win him his country's most honored medal, the Blue Max. The General finds him useful as a hero even though his wife also finds him useful as a love object. In the end the General arranges for him to test-fly an untried fighter.—Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu> 1918. After two years in the trenches, Lieutenant Bruno Stachel becomes a fighter pilot. He joins the fighter squadron of Captain Heidemann. It is soon clear that Stachel's morals and methods are at odds with the chivalrous, honour-led customs of his comrades. Stachel is driven by one thing - get 20 kills and thus win Germany's highest military honour, the Blue Max.—grantss Promoted from the ranks after spending two years in the trenches, Bruno Stachel becomes a flying officer in Germany's World War I air force. Most of the officer corps comes from Germany's aristocratic elite and Stachel feels out of place. This does not dampen his ambition however as he single-mindedly pursues his goal: to be awarded the Blue Max, given for shooting down 20 enemy planes. His blind ambition leads him to claim a kill that is not his and when he confides in the beautiful wife of a General, disaster is inevitable.—garykmcd The year is 1916, the third bloody year of the Great War. Somewhere within the desolate wasteland of the Western Front, young German infantryman Bruno Stachel (George Peppard) takes cover in a muddy trench and looks up to marvel at an aerial dogfight occurring overhead.Two years later, the ambitious Stachel has escaped the trenches and is now a fledgling lieutenant in the increasingly depleted Air Corps. He reports to an aerodrome in France and quickly realizes that he must struggle to be accepted by the aristocratic young airmen of his squadron. Stachel's modest upbringing is ridiculed by his high-born comrades, but in truth his background bothers him far more than it does his fellow airmen. On his first mission, Stachel and another flier shoot down a British observation balloon before being ambushed by a pair of British planes. Stachel's partner is shot down, but Bruno scores his first kill. The wreckage of the British plane remains undiscovered by German ground forces, so there is no official confirmation of Stachel's victory. Incensed, Stachel spends several hours fruitlessly searching for the wreckage. His fellow fliers resent his seeming lack of concern over the death of the other squadron member. When challenged about it, Stachel bitterly retorts that when he was confronted with frequent losses in the trenches there was no time to bury the dead, much less remember them over a glass of champagne.Voluntary patrol pairings are soon announced, and it is apparent that no one wants to fly with Stachel. The squadron's leading ace (and new holder of the coveted Blue Max award), Willi von Klugermann (Jeremy Kemp), eventually agrees to fly with Stachel. While on aerial patrol, Stachel and Willi spot a two-man British reconaissance plane far below them and Stachel attacks it. Stachel badly wounds the rear gunner and attempts to force the British pilot to land at the nearby German airfield. The enemy pilot seems to comply, but as the two planes approach the airfield, the British gunner regains consciousness and tries to open fire. Stachel puts a long burst into the plane and it crashes onto the field, killing both airmen. When Stachel lands, his commander insinuates that Stachel shot down the plane over the field so as to ensure credit for his kill. The other men stare at Stachel reproachfully. He angrily stalks over to the downed plane and carves out the section of canvas with the plane's identification number, throws it at the feet of the squadron adjutant, and smirks sarcastically as he says, ""Confirmed.""Stachel's squadron is soon reviewed in parade formation by General von Klugermann (James Mason), Willi's uncle. The general has brought along his young, beautiful, and voluptuous wife, Countess von Klugermann (Ursula Andress). She looks on admiringly as Willi is officially awarded his Blue Max (Pour Le Merite) medal. During the General's visit, it becomes obvious that rather than being ostracized for the recent shoot-down, Stachel is being positioned as a new kind of ruthless hero for propaganda purposes. The German people are war-weary after four long years, and a heroic, working class flier would serve as a powerful symbol.That night, the Countess comes to Willi's room for a late night visit but accidentally stumbles into Stachel's room next door. She unashamedly admits to an amused Stachel that she and the much older general have an open marriage, and she toys seductively with Bruno before departing for Willi's room.The Germans soon undertake a major new offensive, with the Air Corps lending support. Stachel soon has eight kills to his credit. On solitary patrol one day, Stachel notices a bright red German triplane flying far below him just as it is attacked by a pair of British planes. Stachel dives steeply to aid the triplane pilot and shoots down one of the enemy planes. But the remaining fighter is soon on his tail. A burst of gunfire wounds Stachel in the arm and knocks out his engine. Stachel crash lands in a field and jumps from his burning plane shortly before it explodes. The grateful pilot of the red triplane makes a low pass over Stachel and waggles his wings.Stachel is patched up by a German army medic before a truck arrives to pick him up. Stachel climbs in the back, only to find Willi waiting with a bottle of champagne. Willi congratulates Stachel on his tenth victory before pointedly asking what it's like to be shot down. The two wary rivals fence with each other before Stachel raises the stakes by bringing up the Countess. Willi takes the bait and declares that the Countess, like the 1903 vintage champagne, is a trophy that will prove hard to get. Stachel laughingly accepts the challenge.Back at the airfield, the red triplane is waiting. Baron von Richthofen thanks Stachel for saving his life and invites him to join his squadron. Surprisingly, Stachel declines, stating that he would prefer to prove himself where he started out. General von Klugermann now steps up his Home Front propaganda campaign by summoning the wounded Stachel to Berlin to inspect a sensational new monoplane. The high-performance machine is still deemed too risky to fly. Afterward, Stachel is taken to a hospital and carefully photographed as his injury is tended to. Later, he attends a dinner party at the home of the General. After the rest of the guests have departed, Stachel completes his conquest of the sensuous Countess.Back at the front, Stachel is dropped off at his airfield, where he presents the contemptuous Willi with a bottle of champagne, vintage 1903. Enraged, Willi promises Bruno that his insolence will cost him one day. If they weren't before, the two are now bitter enemies.Germany has now been forced onto the defensive. Willi and Bruno volunteer to escort a reconnaissance mission over British lines in the squadron's only pair of triplanes. They are soon jumped by a British patrol. When Stachel's guns jam, Willi downs the enemy planes on his own. Afterward, he taunts Stachel by rolling his aircraft completely around Bruno's plane. Willi then challenges Stachel to a deadly test of airmanship by executing a dangerous pass through the narrow arch of a bridge. Stachel, accepting the challenge, ups the ante with an even more dangerous low pass. Willi is daunted by the stunt but refuses to concede. He tries to repeat the maneuver and crashes to his death.Back at the field, Stachel is confronted by his commanding officer, Captain Heidemann (Karl Michael Vogler). He inquires about Willi and Stachel reports that he is dead. The captain seethes at Stachel's matter-of-fact attitude and says that Willi was the better man, to which Stachel angrily replies that his death would seem to prove otherwise. The adjutant then enters to announce that two enemy planes were shot down. Heidemann automatically credits the planes to Willi without even asking Stachel. Offended by the captain's reflexive assumption, Stachel foolishly asserts that they were his kills. The incredulous adjutant retorts that the armorer's report indicated that Stachel's guns jammed after only forty rounds were fired. It is obvious that Stachel has lied. Heidemann initially refuses to confirm Stachel's dubious victories, but General von Klugermann orders him to do so.At Willi's funeral, the icy Countess is curiously unmoved by his death, beyong being flattered that he died in a contest over her. When Stachel and the Countess meet for a tryst later that evening, Stachel foolishly confides to her that he claimed two of Willi's kills. Back in combat, Heidemann leads the squadron against large enemy troop formations. He stresses that their mission is to provide strafing and bombing support against the British, not to risk their planes in aerial combat. The German planes wreak havoc among the helpless Tommies. Their presence above the battlefield is uncontested and effective, but then British fighters suddenly appear above them. Heidemann uses hand signals to order the squadron back to base, but Stachel ignores the command and climbs to meet the enemy. One by one, his aggressive squadron mates follow him. A huge dogfight ensues, with numerous losses on both sides. Once on the ground, Heidemann is furious, raging at Stachel that his insubordination has cost half of the squadron. Stachel merely replies that they accounted for seven enemy planes, three of them his. His twenty-two victories have qualified him for the Blue Max, even without the two fraudulent kills. Heidemann swears that he will never wear the medal and vows to court-martial him.Stachel is ordered to Berlin along with Captain Heidemann. Upon their arrival, they encounter a city of long food lines and riots. Germany is in disarray. At headquarters, von Klugermann informs Heidemann that Stachel will receive the Blue Max. Over the Captain's strenuous objections, the General informs him that there will be no court-martial, as it could dishonor the German officer corps and weaken Germany's fragile morale.Stachel is treated to a luxurious hotel suite, where he soon receives a visit from the Countess. She explains that she is leaving- the handwriting is on the wall, Germany will lose the war, and she doesn't intend to stay around for the bitter aftermath. She asks Stachel to come with her, but he coldly informs her that he has no intention of running away to become one of her well-kept lap dogs. The Countess angrily storms from the room.Stachel receives the Blue Max at an airfield the following day. During the ceremonies, General von Klugermann receives a phone call from a Field Marshal. Stachel's unearned kills have come to light, via a petulant phone call from the Countess. Stachel is to be publicly disgraced. The General angrily confronts his vindictive wife, but the die is already cast.Captain Heidemann, who has just completed a test flight in the new monoplane, enters the airfield command shack to tell von Klugermann that the machine's structural design is seriously flawed. It is a death trap. The General dismises Heidemann and issues an immediate order to have Stachel sent up in the monoplane, with the added admonition to really put the airplane through her paces. Stachel puts on a dazzling display of aerobatics until the performance is abruptly ended by the loud rending of metal from high above. Stachel's plane enters a death spiral and crashes in the distance. His personnel file is officially stamped and closed as von Klugermann announces that Lieutenant Stachel died a hero."

Torn Curtain,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061107/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An American scientist publicly defects to East Germany as part of a cloak and dagger mission to find the solution for a formula resin before planning an escape back to the West. Professor Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) is heading to Copenhagen, Denmark to attend a physics conference accompanied by his assistant and fiancée Sarah Sherman (Dame Julie Andrews). Once arrived however, Michael informs her that he may be staying for awhile and she should return home. She follows him and realizes he's actually heading to East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain. She follows him there and is shocked when he announces that he's defecting to the East after the U.S. government cancelled his research project. In fact, Michael is there to obtain information from a renowned East German scientist. Once the information is obtained, he and Sarah now have to make their way back to the West.—garykmcd Representing the U.S. Interspace Committee, nuclear physicists Professor Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) and Dr. Sarah Sherman (Dame Julie Andrews) - the latter not only the former's assistant, but also his fiancée - are attending a scientific congress in Copenhagen. She knows that he didn't want her to come on this trip, and when she learns that he is trying to leave Copenhagen without her during the middle of the congress, she discovers why: he is defecting to East Germany to work for the other side in he being angered that the U.S. cancelled his work which, if he was able to carry it to its completion, he hoping now to be able to do so at Karl Marx University in Leipzig alongside famed Professor Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath), it would render the atomic bomb and thus nuclear war obsolete. Caught behind the Iron Curtain along with Michael, Sarah has to decide if her love for him is stronger than her love of country and loyalty to the U.S. What she is unaware of, and what Michael has not told her for her own protection, is that he is acting as a double agent trying to get the missing piece of the puzzle to his work from Lindt, without giving up anything meaningful in return, to bring back to the U.S. Sarah's presence only complicates matters in now having the underground that is assisting him needing to get two instead of one person back to the west after Michael gets what he needs from Lindt. With the East German Secret Service carefully watching Michael and now Sarah's moves, their task becomes all the more difficult especially in the escape with Michael's very high profile arrival in East Germany making him a minor celebrity.—Huggo U.S. rocket scientist Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) and his assistant and fiancée Sarah Sherman (Dame Julie Andrews) are attending a convention in Copenhagen, Denmark. Michael is acting very suspiciously and Sarah follows him to East Germany when he apparently tries to defect to the other side.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> American scientist Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) defects to East Germany, followed by his reluctant fiancée Sarah Sherman (Dame Julie Andrews). It's no surprise to learn that the defection is not genuine, and that his real mission is to steal a secret mathematical formula from a professor in Leipzig.—filmfactsman Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman), an esteemed American physicist and rocket scientist, is to attend a scientific conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. He takes a cruise ship to Copenhagen along with his assistant and fiancée, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews). Armstrong tells Sherman that he did not want her to come along, and en route to Copenhagen, he receives a radiogram to pick up a book once in Copenhagen. The book, allegedly a first-edition of one of Armstrong's book, actually contains a message that says, ""Contact in case (of emergency.)"" He tells Sherman he is going to Stockholm, but she discovers he is flying to East Berlin, and she follows him there. When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government, and Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected to the other side. Sherman, however, is extremely uncomfortable with this move, realizing if the apparent defection is in fact real, given the circumstances of the Cold War of the period, she would likely never see her home or family again. They are constantly accompanied by Professor Karl Manfred (Günter Strack), who took part in arranging Armstrong's defection to the East.Armstrong visits a contact, a 'farmer' (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment in order to learn just how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. While Armstrong does not inform the U.S. government of his plan, he has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as (Pi).However, Armstrong is followed to this farm by his official body man, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer assigned to him. Gromek realizes what is and that Armstrong is a double agent, and as Gromek is calling the police to report his suspicions, a tortuous and violent fight scene commences that ends with Gromek being killed. So as to not arouse the suspicion of the taxi driver who brought Armstrong to the farm, a gun is not used to kill Gromek, but instead he is choked, stabbed, hit with a shovel, and, ultimately, gassed to death by Armstrong and the farmer's wife (Carolyn Conwell). Gromek and his motorcycle are then buried by the 'farmer' and his wife. The taxicab driver (Peter Lorre Jr.) who drove Armstrong to the farm, however, reports on Armstrong's behavior to the police when he later sees Gromek's missing person ad in the newspaper. The remains of Gromek are found; the fate of the farmer's wife is not shown.Meanwhile, Armstrong visits the physics faculty of Karl Marx University in Leipzig, where his interview with the scientists is abruptly ended when he is questioned by security officials about the missing Gromek. At the same time, the faculty try to interrogate Sherman about her knowledge of the American ""Gamma Five"" anti-missile program, but she refuses to cooperate and runs from the room even though she had agreed to cooperate and defect to East Germany. At this point, Armstrong secretly confides to her his actual motives, and asks her to go along with the ruse. He finally goads Professor Lindt into revealing his anti-missile equations in a fit of pique over what Lindt believes are Armstrong's mathematical mistakes. When Lindt hears over the university's loudspeaker system that Armstrong and Sherman are being sought for questioning when Gromek's body is found, he realizes that he has given up his secrets while learning nothing in return. Armstrong and Sherman escape from the school with a little help from of the university clinic physician Dr. Koska (Gisela Fischer).They travel to East Berlin, pursued by the Stasi, in a decoy bus operated by the escape network, led by Mr. Jacobi (David Opatoshu). Roadblocks, highway robbery by Soviet Army deserters, and bunching with the ""real"" bus result in the police becoming aware of the decoy bus and everyone flees off the bus and scatter in the streets.While looking for the Friedrichstraße post office, the two encounter the exiled Polish countess Kuchinska (Lila Kedrova) who leads them to the post office in hopes of being sponsored for an American visa. The police find Armstrong and Sherman at the post office, and Kuchinska throws herself in front of the police so they can go to their next destination, a travel agency.When Armstrong and Sherman arrive at the travel agency, however, the police were performing a raid. Two men from the travel agency walk up to them on the sidewalk - one is the 'farmer' - and give them tickets to the ballet, with the plan being to travel with the troupe to Sweden later that night. While they are attending the ballet and waiting for the pick-up, they are reported to the police because they were spotted by the lead Russian ballerina (Tamara Toumanova), who bears a bit of a grudge; Earlier in the film, she flew to East Berlin on the same airplane as Armstrong, and mistakenly believed the press were there to greet her, rather than Armstrong. Armstrong and Sherman escape through a crowded theater by shouting ""fire"".With the help of the escape network, Armstrong and Sherman hide in a crate of props belonging to a traveling Czech circus troupe. They cross the Baltic Sea to Sweden on a freighter. The ballerina makes a mistake in uncovering where Armstrong and Sherman are hiding on the ship, and the wrong crates are fired on when already dangling over the pier (thus, Swedish crane operators technically have control over the property once it was off an East German boat), and Armstrong and Sherman are able to escape by jumping overboard and swimming to a Swedish dock, safe at last."
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060438/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A wily Roman slave schemes to earn his freedom by romantically uniting his master with a courtesan. But matters get complicated and he ends up dragging in his neighbors around him, leading to chaos. Pseudolus (Zero Mostel), the laziest slave in Rome, has one wish: to purchase his freedom. When his master and mistress leave for the day, he finds out that the young master has fallen in love with a virgin in the house of Marcus Lycus (Phil Silvers), a slave dealer specializing in beautiful women. Pseudolus concocts a deal in which he will be freed if he can procure the girl for young Hero (Michael Crawford). Of course, it can't be that simple, and everything begins to go wrong.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Set in Rome during the first century A.D. during the early years of the Roman Empire, the film opens with one of the musicals most famous songs, ""Comedy Tonight,"" performed by Pseudolus. The lyrics tell the audience they will see some familiar things, others peculiar, some appealing, others appalling, some gaudy, and definitely others that are bawdy, in other words, something for everyone. Ultimately, Pseudolus promises a happy ending. The action, Pseudolus tells the audience, takes place in Rome around three adjacent houses: the house of Erronius (Latin for ""wrong""), an old man who has been searching for his children who were stolen by pirates while they were infants; the house of Marcus Lycus, a buyer and seller of beautiful women, and the house of Senex (Latin for ""old man"" or ""senile""), a Roman senator, his wife, Domina (Latin for ""mistress""), who is loathed by her husband, their son, Hero, and his slave, Pseudolus, who is attempting to raise enough money to buy his freedom.One day when Senex and Domina leave for a trip, Hero tells Pseudolus that he's in love with a girl in the house next door. Pseudolus seizes the opportunity to bargin for his freedom. Hero agrees if Pseudolus can get the girl for him, he will free him.Pseudolus and Hero visit the house of Lycus to purchase Hero's beloved. Lycus presents several of his courtesans for their inspection: Tintinabula (Latin for ""bell""), a bell-wearing beauty, dances to middle eastern music; Vibrata (Latin for ""vibrant""), an energetic, lively dark-skinned lovely who is dressed in a leopard skin bikini, dances to jazz; Geminae (Latin for ""twins"") are a matched pair that Lycus will not separate; Panacea (Latin for ""cure all"") dances seductively; and Gymnasia (Latin for ""nude,"" which she may have been in the original musical, but in the film she is portrayed as speechless) is a mute from the Island of Silent Women. Gymnasia and Pseudolus communicate in sign language and he immediately falls for her. When Hero's dream woman is not among the girls who are presented, Lycus tells them that she is a virgin who recently arrived from Crete and he has sold her to a famous Roman soldier. Being an excellent fabricator of lies, Pseudolus claims Crete has been ravaged by a plague, and since he has already had the plague, he would happily look after the girl in Senex's house until the soldier comes to claim her. Lycus gulibly agrees to Pseudolus offer.Once they return to the house of Senex, Hero and the girl get to know each other. He learns that her name is Philia (which in Greek means ""love""). Philia sings ""Lovely"" (as ""I'm Lovely""), in which she explains that ""lovely is the one thing I can do."" Hero then sings his reply, ""You're Lovely,"" and they both agree they are happy to have found each other. Even though Philia has fallen in love with Hero, she insists she must honor the contract Marcus Lycus made to sell her.Pseudolus devises a plan to give Philia a sleeping potion. Once she is unconscious, he will tell Lycus that she died from the plague. When they move her body for burial, Hero can then take her away to Greece and Pseudolus will get his freedom. Pseudolus steals a potion book from Hysterium (Latin for ""hysterial""), another slave in the house of Senex. The only sleeping potion ingredient he doesn't have is mare's sweat, so he and Hero head in different directions to obtain some.While they are away, Senex unexpectedly returns home and knocks three times on his door. Pseudolus had told Philia that three knocks was the signal of her purchaser, Captain Miles Gloriosus (Latin for ""braggart soldier""). Hearing the knocks, Philia assumes Senex is the captain, so she offers herself to him. She tells him that he may have her body but will never have her heart. The old Senator is more than happy to take her body, with or without her heart.Pseudolus returns with the mare's sweat just in time to see Senex and Philia embracing. He tells Senex that the girl is a new maid he has hired. That leads into the hilarious song, ""Everybody Ought to Have a Maid."" Senex is very much in favor of maids especially those who butter up the master with sexual favors. Hysterium joins Senex and Pseudolus for a chorus of the song, and then they are joined by Lycus, who is checking on the condition of the virgin. These lecherous fellows particularly like maids who wriggle, giggle and jiggle as they putter around the house.After the song, Pseudolus convinces Senex that he needs a bath after his road trip (Senex is actually smelling the mare's sweat) and since his son could be home, he should bathe and receive the girl in Erronius' long-abandoned house next door.Just after Senex heads for his bath, Erronius returns from his exhaustive twenty year search for his two long-lost offspring. The elderly and semi-senial Erronius, who is now almost blind, reveals that each of the children is wearing a ring with a gaggle of geese engraved upon it.When Erronius heads for his house, he hears Senex singing as he bathes. Hysterium, desperate to keep Erronius out of his house, tells the old man his house is haunted. Erronius demands Hysterium find a soothsayer to banish the haunting spirit from his house. Overhearing, Psuedolus pretends to be a soothsayer and orders Erronius to run around the Seven Hills of Rome seven times to banish the spirit.Meanwhile, two Roman Army emissaries of Captain Miles Gloriosus arrive at Lycus' house to make certain everything is in order for their commander to receive his purchased courtesan. They threaten to turn Lycus' women over to the soldiers and burn his house if anything is amiss.Fearing the Captain's wrath, Lycus talks Pseudolus into substituting for him for an hour. Pseudolus is more than happy to oblige since he gets to see Gymnasia again. Pseudolus convinces Lycus that it would be best to move all the girls into Senex's house. Meanwhile, Senex has finished his bath, but orders Hysterium to bring him an energy (love) potion prior to his rendezvous with Philia.When Captain Gloriosus and his troops march into the city, the captain sings ""Bring Me My Bride."" This conceited soldier claims to be a man among men but is also admired and desired by all women. He is impatient to receive his bride because he has towns to plunder, temples to burn and women to abuse.Pseudolus, pretending to be Lycus, tires to delay delivering Philia. The Captain gives him half an hour to deliver the girl or else. While Gloriosus waits, he dictates his memoirs and his men enjoy Lycus' courtesans.
Meanwhile, Lycus, who is drinking in a nearby bar, learns from a fellow patron there is no plague in Crete. When he tries to return to reveal the lie, he isn't admitted into his own house because everyone, as he had instructed, swears Pseudolus is Lycus.Domina returns from her trip early because she had a premonition that Senex was up to something. She goes to the market to purchase a breeder slave and picks a robust, stocky female specimen. Once they return home, the breeder takes a liking to Pseudolus. He puts her in a room and tells her he will knock on the door three times when he returns. He sends one of the Captain's soldiers to the room and tells him to knock three times (the soldier thinks he's getting one of Lycus' women). Later, Pseudolus sends Senex to the breeder's room (Senex assumes Philia is there), but escapes the breeder slave through the window.When Domina is introduced to the Captain, she is smitten. Then when Hysterium brings the energy potion to Senex, Domina stops him and thirstly consumes the liquid. Pseudolus tells Domina to wait in the Green Room and he will send the Captain to her. About the same time, Senex climbs in the window of the Green Room, where he expects to be joined by Philia. He and his wife are both unpleasantly surprised to end up in the same room.
When Philia hears the voice of the Captain, she recognizes it as the brute who raped her country, ""Thrace."" She claims he did it three times. Pseudolus questions, ""He raped Thrace thrice?""Pseudolus decides to tell the Captain the virgin has died, but in order to make it convincing, he needs a body. After a lot of convincing, Hysterium agrees to dress in drag and pretend to be the dead Philia. Pseudolus sings a reprise of ""Lovely"" (as ""You're Lovely""; a hilarious self-spoof of the musical number sung by Hero earlier in the film) to convince Hysterium he can pull off the ruse. Once convinced, Hysterium sings ""I'm Lovely."" To complete Hysterium's outfit, Pseudolus gives him the old man's ring - the one with the gaggle of geese.As the funeral procession begins, Hero returns with a cup of mare's sweat. He is so distraught when he learns that Philia is dead that he plans to throw himself to the lions. Before he leaves, however, Senex mistakes the mare's sweat for the energy potion, drinks it and immediately passes out.Pseudolus tells the Captain the virgin died because the sight of his glorious physique was too much of a shock. The conceited Gloriosus competely understands and is saddened that the girl would have died before she experienced him. Gloriosus insists on a proper funeral including cremation of the body. He also composes and sings a funeral dirge (""The Dirge""). When the Captain starts to give the dead virgin a farewell kiss, Pseudolus tells him she actually died of the plague she contracted in Crete. Unfortunately, the Captain had been stationed in Crete and knew there was no plague there. When the Captain says he is going to cut the girl's heart out and take it with him, Hysterium jumps up and runs away. Gymnasia communicates to Philia that Hero thinks she is dead, so he is going to throw himself to the lions. Distraught, Philia decides to sacrifice herself to the gods. Gymnasia then tells Pseudolus that Philia and Hero are both planning to kill themselves.Hero sneaks into a nearby arena during a gladiator training session. Pseudolus finds him there just before the gladitor knocks Hero in the head. He manages to save Hero and tells him that Philia is alive and has gone to the Temple of the Virgins to sacrifice herself. The gladitor then fights Pseudolus and captures him, but Gymnasia saves Pseudolus and they get away in a chariot.Hero climbs to the roof of the Temple and from a hole in the top saves Philia. They ride away in a chariot. A madcap, comic chase ensues with the Captain chasing Hero and Philia and Pseudolus and Gymnasia. Once the Captain captures them, they return to Rome for a quick wedding and a slow execution.Back in the city, Erronius, who has made several circles around the hills of the city, recognizes the gaggle-of-geese ring worn by Philia. Miles also has a gaggle-of-geese ring, which means they are brother and sister - the long-lost siblings of Erronius. That means Philia is a free-born citizen of Rome and cannot be sold as a courtesan. It also means that the Captain cannot marry his sister, so Hero and Philia can marry.A happy ending just as the lyrics of ""Comedy Tonight"" had promised (a reprise of the song is heard). Hero and Philia get each other, Senex and Domina get each other (whether they like it or not), Miles gets the twins, Erronius gets his family back, the soldiers get Lycus' women, Lycus must get a new supply of girls, and Pseudolus gets his freedom. And the moral? The cast sings, ""Morals tomorrow! Comedy tonight!"""

It wasn't until near the end of Owen's stay that the Starrs and the rest of the town learned that he was a New Orleans-based railroad executive in town to review the personnel records to see which men would be laid off, largely because of the downturn in the economy, which would probably negatively affect the Starrs' livelihood.

The Face of Another,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061065/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A businessman with a disfigured face obtains a lifelike mask from his doctor, but the mask starts altering his personality. A businessman facially scarred in a laboratory explosion receives treatment from a psychiatrist, and obtains an amazingly life-like mask from the doctor. Soon after being fitted for the mask, he attempts to seduce his wife and succeeds. But his wife claims she was aware all along who he was and believed that both were just masquerading together as men and women do in different ways. Strangely enough, his personality seemingly begins to change after he puts on the mask as if the mask has influenced his personality. His new identity does not enable him to reintegrate into society after all. A subplot is inserted in fragments. A good-natured young woman, the right side of whose face is disfigured, has been hurt by others' inquisitive eyes and insults, and has been shunned by men. She asks her older brother, the only man who understands her pain and solitude, to make love to her, hiding from him the intent of killing herself afterwards.—Prion Mr. Okuyama, a business executive, is involved in a workplace industrial accident, which leaves his face severely burned. Rather than show his scarred face to the world, he would rather keep his entire head bandaged whenever he is in public. Although he takes some responsibility for what happened to him, he is very bitter, not so much about his face, but at the people he feels have abandoned him, including his wife. He asks his psychiatrist, Dr. Hori, to help him kill himself. Dr. Hori believes he has a more palatable alternative, albeit one that may not be ethical: Dr. Hori will create a life-like mask for him to wear, one that only a trained eye could tell is not a real face, it which would allow him to assume another identity completely. While Mr. Okuyama just wants to have some semblance of normalcy in agreeing, Dr. Hori, who is treating this process like a scientific psychological experiment, has the caveat that he wants Mr. Okuyama to report back his every action and encounter as he truly does believe that the mask will take on an identity of its own. As Okuyama goes through the growing pains of being comfortable not only wearing the mask but all that goes along with being someone else (despite his assertions that he will always be who he is), he divulges his true intention with the mask which has specifically to do with reclaiming his wife. That mission ends up having unintended consequences. A parallel, separate story is interwoven with Okuyama's, it concerning a young woman with a burn scar on the right side of her face, the scar which she generally hides by her hairstyle, and the true emotions she is dealing with regarding her disfigurement.—Huggo This follow-up to Abe and Teshigahara's Sunna no Onna (1965) is even more surrealistic, thanks to the intrusion of science fiction elements. Tatsuya Nakadai (X) is horribly burned it a laboratory accident and seeks the help of Dr. K___, who designs a new face for him out of a realistic mask. Is the mask controlling him, or did he create the personality of the mask?

The coachman leaves Dr. Eswai at the boundary of the village and advises him to return, since the place would have been abandoned by God. Dr. Eswai is assisted in the autopsy by Monica Schuftan, a young woman that has just returned to her hometown, and they find a coin in the heart of the woman. Inspector Kruger goes to the Graps Villa to investigate the rumors about a local curse. The curse claims that the victims are killed by the ghost of a girl called Melissa. Meanwhile, Ruth, who is the local witch and mistress of Burgomaster Karl, tries to protect the daughter of the innkeeper, Nadienne, with magic under the protest of Dr. Eswai. When Karl and Nadienne are murdered, Dr. Eswai goes to Trap Villa and discloses an evil curse on the feared and superstitious villagers produced by the hatred of her grieving mother.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Romania, the 19th Century. Dr. Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) arrives in a secluded Transylvanian village where he checks into a local inn and meets with Inspector Kruger (Piero Lulli) the local constable who is investigating the death of a young girl employed as a maid at Villa Graps. The inspector has summoned Dr. Eswai to the village to perform an autopsy on the girl, much to the dismay of the locals. With the assistance of Monica (Erika Blanc), a nurse who just recently returned to the village for the first time since she was a child, Dr. Eswai carries out the autopsy. They make an incredible discovery: a gold coin imbedded in the dead girls heart. Monica reveals that this is consistent with a local superstion. Only with money in the heart, can one who meets a violent death ever rest in peace, says Monica. Following the autopsy, Eswai assists Monica back to her home. He is then attacked by a small mob of several villagers who swear vengeance on him for profaning the dead girls body. Only the sudden appearance of a mysterious woman, clad in black, saves the doctor from being beaten to death. But before he can thank her, she disappears into the fog.Back at the inn, Eswai receives a note instructing him to join Inspector Kruger at Villa Graps. When the doctor asks Nadine (Micaela Esdra), the innkeepers little girl, to direct him to the villa, she tells him to stay away from it. But Eswai leaves for the villa anyway, and when Nadine goes to lock the front door behind him, she is terrified by the sight of a ghostly little girl, peering in at her through the window. Nadine tells her parents what she saw, and they send out for Ruth (Fabienne Dali), a local sorceress who has the ability to ward off evil spirits. When she arrives, Ruth is the same black-clad woman who had earlier rescued Dr. Eswai from the villagers. Ruth says several prayers over the girl before giving her a leech-vine to wear around her waist. Ruth says that as long as she wears this, Nadine will be safe.
At the villa, Eswai is confronted by Baroness Graps (Giana Vivaldi). Shut away from the outside world in a morbid environment dominated by black lace curtains and remnant of the past, the Baroness appears haunted by supernatural apparitions. She curtly tells Eswai that she never receives guests, denies any knowledge of Inspector Krugers whereabouts, and eventually slam the parlor door in his face. The doctor then sees a ghostly, white-clad girl, who identifies herself as Melissa (Valerio Valeri). He attempts to talk to her, refusing to believe the superstitions of the villagers, but she walks around a corner and disappears. Without the inspector to assist him, Eswai makes his way back to the inn.Meanwhile, Monica is plague by a nightmare in which she is menaced by a chillingly innocent-looking doll. When she wakes up, she finds the exact same doll laying at her feet. She flees from her house and runs into the doctor on the street. Together they return to the inn. Monica confesses her fears to Eswai that she may be cursed. Eswai assures her that these strange occurrences are the products of fear and supersition, not of the supernatural. While Monica is shown to a room by the innkeeper, Eswai is distracted by moans coming from Nadines room. He goes in and sees the little girl withering about in bed, apparently suffering from a fever. Pulling back the sheets, he finds the leech-vine. Though her mother assures him that it is only for her own good, the doctor takes it off her. His care for the girl does no good, for later that night the ghost of Melissa reappears, compelling the girl to commit suicide.Eswai and Monica continue to delve into the mysterious of the death and of the ghostly little girl. A strange light appears in the nearby cemetery, and an investigation results in the discovery of Inspector Kruger, who has been shot through the head at close range. Eswai brings this latest crime to the attention of the Karl the Burgomaster (Max Lawrence), who reluctantly agrees to shed some light on the situation. The Burgomaster tells them that several years ago, Baroness Graps placed a curse on the whole town when her young daughter, Melissa, was trampled to death by the drunken townspeople during a village festival. Now the ghost of Melissa haunts the guilt-ridden people, and all who make mention of the Baroness or her child soon bleed to death under mysterious circumstances. The Burgomaster also reveals that to Monica that she is actually the dead girl's sister. He offers to go back to his residence to offer them proof. But when the Burgomaster goes back to his house and searches his attic for Monica's birth certificate, he too is driven to suicide when Melissa appears in the attic.Ewai and Monica go to the villa where Monica is warmly greeted by the Baroness with open arms. She confirms the Burgomisters story and explains how Monica was smuggled out the villa by the servants when she was just a child soon after Melissas death. When Monica suddenly disappears, Eswai searches for her in various rooms. Eswai follows her screams before catching sight of another man running through a series of rooms lined with red curtains. Eswai chases this person though apparently the same red curtained room over and over, getting closer to his target at every pass. Eventually, Eswai catches the man and when he turns around, the doctor is shocked to see his mirror image. A second later the doppelganger figure is gone, a hallucination conjured up by the supernatural forces of the villa. The doctor, frightened and disoriented, backs into a cobweb covered fresco on the wall which depicts the outside of the villa. As the image pulls back, he appears to be a fly caught in a web. He is no longer indoors, and the fresco is now the actually outside of the villa, some distance in the background. Eswai shakes loose of the web, and faints.When he wakes up a little later, he is in Ruth's care. To the people of the village, Ruth, with he magic spells an d charms, is the only doctor of any use. It is the ultimate irony that she should be administering to the needs of the man of science who scoffs at superstatiion. Further compounding the irony is that this is the second time she has rescued the doctor.At this point, convention logic is useless to the doctor. The norms of the advanced society where he comes from, and comes to represent to the backwards villagers, are totally dissolved. With the deaths of the Burgomaster and the police inspector, social order is diminished in the village. The only authority figure to carry any weight are the Baroness, her ghostly avenger, and the sorceress whose spells prove to have more power than any medicine the doctor has. Eswai forgets his preconceived notions and is willing to accept the presence of the supernatural.Eswai returns to the villa to find Monica, but Ruth also tags along and comes face to face with the Baroness at last. Spurred on the by death of the Burgomaster, her lover, Ruth attacks the Baroness, but who gets the upper hand and stabs Ruth in the chest with a fireplace poker. Ignoring the seriousness of her wounds, Ruth strangles the Baroness to death with her bare hands before she expires too. With the Baroness death, a force flows out and the ghost of Melissa, on the verge of having Eswai commit suicide himself, disappears having been put to rest at last. Eswai and Monica realize that they are now free to leave the village to start their lives over elsewhere."

Island of Terror,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060548/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An isolated remote island community is threatened by an attack by tentacled silicates which liquefy and digest bone and tissue. A small, isolated island community's terrorised from a horde of creeping, blobbish, tentacled monsters which liquefy and digest the bones from living creatures. The community struggles to fight back, against these horrors.—Michael ""Rabbit"" Hutchison <rabhutch@spacestar.net> The action takes place on Petrie's Island, off the east coast of Ireland--isolated, with a small village peopled with farmers and fishermen, with one constable, a ""head"" whose job is quite informal, and one doctor. Dr. Lawrence Phillips (Peter Forbes-Robertson) comes to the island and sets up a sophisticated laboratory, the most wonderous thing of its kind the islanders have ever seen, in a isolated mansion on the island's peninsula. Dr. Phillips and his number-one assistant Carson (Richard Bidlake) supervise the unloading of what turns out to be the last of their equipment. Watching from nearby, Peter Argyle (James Caffrey), the keeper of the general store, chats with Roger Campbell (Niall McGinnis), the ""head"" or mayor of the island; Constable John Harris (Sam Kydd); Dr. Reginald Landers (Eddie Byrne); and Ian Bellows (Liam Gaffney), an ordinary farmer. The most remarkable thing about Dr. Phillips is that he is a recluse. Dr. Landers explains that away by saying that all researchers close themselves off from contact from any human beings except their own teams and staffs. Ian and John remark to Mr. Campbell about all the promises that ""the mainland"" has made to the islanders, but never kept, because the tax revenues from the island are so little.In the laboratory, Dr. Phillips tells Carson that they will begin, without co-ordinating with their Rome, New York, and Tokyo teams. Phillips questions Carson quite closely on the state of their equipment. Finally he announces to his team that he will proceed with a revolutionary process that, he is absolutely sure, will yield the dream of the medical sciences: a successful and unfailing treatment for cancer.With that, he turns to. Then as the screen turns blood-red, the sound of breaking glass breaks out--as if to suggest a dangerous...something...breaching containment. A sequence no more than a frame or two long--a subliminal cut--shows Dr. Phillips and his two assistants lying dead on the laboratory floor, and the breached containment vessel. And then the main title begins.The action resumes, presumably that evening. The fog that Peter Argyle confidently predicted (""If you weren't a newcomer, you'd feel it in your bones.""), has rolled in. Ian Bellows, carrying a lantern, reconnoiters a cave on his land near the Phillips house. Suddenly he hears an odd-sounding noise, mostly in the base register, and sounding like nothing so much as a kind of atonal music, weak on melody but strong on deep, pulsing rhythm with haunting sussurations. He walks into the cave--and then gives out a loud outcry. It is the last sound he utters. The next sound that comes from that cave is a sound very much like the one a child makes as he rudely slurps up the last dregs of a thickshake through a straw.His wife (Joyce Hemson) waits impatiently for Ian to come home. When he does not, she goes to Harris' house to complain and express her concern. Harris goes to the cave to investigate. He finds Bellows, or what's left of him--soft, flabby, face caved in, eyes and tongue bulging out. At once he fetches Dr. Landers, who asks Harris to help him take the unfortunate Bellows to the island clinic. There he performs a complete autopsy, that reveals little. Yes, it is Bellows, for apart from his clothes, Landers recognizes an old appendectomy scar that he, Dr. Landers, gave Bellows once. But Bellows' entire skeleton is simply missing.Landers first calls on Dr. Phillips, but no one answers the door. So Landers takes the emergency launch to the mainland, where he then gets more conventional transport to London. There he seeks out Dr. Brian Stanley (Peter Cushing), the most eminent pathologist in all the British Isles. Stanley admits that a case of a man with no bones has him stumped. He suggests they seek out Dr. David West (Edward Judd), orthopedic surgeon and the most eminent specialist in management of diseases of the bone.Dr. West is at this moment entertaining a flighty young lady, Toni Merrill (Carole Gray). She recently became his patient after she smashed up her Maserati and landed in the emergency suite while he, West, was the attending-on-call. After her discharge, West had her up to his flat for dinner--where he managed to spill wine on her dress. (Whether that was his fault or hers, the story never makes clear.) So when we first see Toni, she is wearing one of David West's shirts, and nothing else, and flirting outrageously with him. The truth of the matter is that Toni Merrill is the type one will find in all of Western civilization: a spoiled rich girl. And she has set her sights on West, primarily because she finds him dashingly attractive.In the middle of this flirtatious session, West's doorbell rings. West tells Toni where she can find his dressing gown, and then answers the door to admit Stanley and Landers. Toni, not shy in the least, comes out, and does not mind being the center of attention. She listens as Landers and Stanley explain their problem to West. The problem fascinates West, who would very much like to see Bellows' body for himself. The three men decide they ought to fly back, but how? Then Toni offers to prevail on her father to lend them his helicopter--on condition they take her with them on what she is sure to be a marvelous adventure. West is reluctant, but Stanley and Landers point out that time is of the essence. So West accepts her bargain.The four prepare to fly to the island, but their pilot tells them they can't expect him to wait, because Toni's father has need of the helicopter. So they will be effectively marooned. In the conversation that follows, they speak of solitaire, and Toni says she has a more interesting game in mind. Let the viewer interpret that however (s)he likes.The four fly to the island, and Constable Harris and a hunter named Dunley (Roger Heathcote) greet them.The first thing Landers does is take Stanley and West to the clinic and show them Bellows' body--which Stanley pronounces ""not a pretty sight."" The three perform more thorough tests, which yield a strange finding: micro-punctures, or micro-ruptures, all over the skin. As if something, or someone, injected something into the body--or sucked it out. They cannot tell which.Finding the clinic facility woefully inadequate to the task of conducting a proper autopsy, the three men then set out for the mansion of the reclusive Dr. Phillips. (Landers takes time to write a note to Constable Harris that he may find him there should he need to speak to him.) There they find Dr. Phillips' butler, his two assistants, and Phillips himself, all nastily dead, and all showing the same horrific disfigurement as Bellows. Stanley concludes: Phillips managed to concoct something in his laboratory that got loose, killed him and his team and butler, and then killed Bellows. And might kill any number of other people.To find out what, Stanley and West gather up all of Dr. Phillips' notes, to take them to the inn to study at greater leisure. But while they are doing this, Farmer Morton (Shay Gorman) discovers one of his horses dead, soft, and flabby. He reports this to Harris, who then sets out, on the strength of the note, to find Dr. Landers and speak to him. So Harris goes to Phillips' house alone, and finds pretty much the same things Stanley, West, and Landers have already found. And then, as he goes into the cellar, he now hears, for the first time, that strange, ominous, atonal, rhythmic and sussurating music. He follows it into the room that once housed test animals--and there a tentacle, with suckers on it like those on an octopus, snags him under his chin and causes him to cry out in pain. It is his last cry.The next morning, Landers goes to call on Harris but does not find him. Landers then goes to the general store, where he finds Peter and Morton. Morton informs Landers of his dead horse, and that he had told Harris about it. Landers notes that this happened on ""the other side of the island,"" then rushes off--abruptly enough that Morton and Peter wonder about ""strange goings-on."" Peter decides to go see Mr. Campbell; this is something the Head of the island ought to know about.Campbell is not pleased at this news. He takes Peter with him to talk to some other farmers, see what they might have seen, and then go see Dr. Landers.Landers returns to the inn and gathers up Stanley, West, and now Toni Merrill, who insists on coming along. They stop by the farm to investigate the dead horse. Toni stays in the motorcar--and hears the strange music, and then, through the rear window, sees a horrible-looking mass of suckers slide past! She shrieks. The men come running and take her account, which doesn't amount to much, except that what she saw frightened her very badly.The four drive to the Phillips house, where this time they agree to take Toni with them--they now deal with a hazard that they can best defend against if they all stay together. Once inside, they descend into the cellar, where they find Harris--dead and flabby, like all the rest. And there, for the first time, they all hear the music that Toni heard, and then see what can only be the creature, or creatures, that Dr. Phillips created.Each creature is two meters across and flat to the ground. It looks like a turtle that moves on a base of suckers instead of conventional legs. It has a single tentacle that comes out of the front of its armor-plated dorsum and seems to act as combination sensor and prehensile manipulator. The four retreat from it, only to find a second such creature moving in from another corridor. Cornered by this obviously coordinated attack, the three back against a wall that happens to house the fire-fighting equipment. Dr. Landers takes down the fire ax and takes a swing at the creature in front of them. Not a scratch. He pulls back to take another swing, when the creature snags his ankle with its tentacle. Landers cries out in pain, again and again, and falls prone across the creature--and then, before everyone' horrified eyes, turns soft and flabby. Toni can't take it; she buries her face in West's chest and clings to him tightly.Now the creatures move in for the kill--and then stop. And then they divide, looking very much the way cells caught in mitotic anaphase do under a microscope--except that these creatures are two meters across! Happily, they go inert during this process, and that gives Stanley, West and Toni time to escape--though Toni is so badly frightened that West has to drag her along. The three rush from the house, only to see another of those creatures prowling about in the yard. They pile into their car--which won't start. West pops the hood and barely manages to fix the problem, close the hood, jump back into the car, start the engine, and drive off before that creature can overtake them.Back at the inn, West gives Toni a mild sedative and apologizes to her for bringing her to the island and exposing her to the hazard. She in turn apologizes for being so much trouble.Meanwhile, Campbell and Peter Argyle return to the general store. There they meet Dunley, who wants to know about an order of guns he had placed. Peter asks Dunley whether he has seen Dr. Landers--apparently he and Campbell haven't found him. Dunley says that Landers ""left"" at 7:00 in the morning, with three strangers--two men and a girl. Strangers who landed on the island by helicopter the night before. This is the first time Campbell has heard of three strangers on his island, all working with Dr. Landers, and now he is irritated. Taking Peter with him, they set out for the inn, where they might find all the strangers.West and Stanley return to studying Phillips' notes, when Campbell and Argyle walk in. The two doctors bravely admit that Dr. Landers is dead, and so is Constable Harris (and Ian Bellows), and that the island, its entire populace included, are in serious danger. Campbell reluctantly agrees to summon all the inhabitants to the village meeting hall, which adjoins the clinic.Campbell assembles everyone, as West and Stanley have suggested. Then Stanley and West, having finished studying the Phillips notes, address the villagers. Their story is dire: Phillips, in trying to create a culture of artificial killer cells that could attack cancer in a patient's body, instead created a creature of an entirely different order: one based on silicon rather than carbon, to which Stanley gives the name ""Silicate."" These creatures dine on animal and human bone. They inject a powerful enzyme cocktail into the body to liquefy the skeleton, and then suck this out of the body, using the suckers on their tentacles and ventral surfaces. The first such creature broke containment, killed Phillips and his team and staff, and then killed Bellows. And worse yet: these silicates reproduce by fission (which is what Stanley, West, and Toni witnessed) every six hours. There are sixty-four silicates on the island at present--and at six o'clock that evening there will be 128, and at midnight 256, and in three days there'll be a million of them (this after twenty fission cycles total, including the six that have already taken place; we may assume that Phillips and company died shortly before midnight the day before yesterday, and Bellows soon thereafter).West proposes the obvious: ""deny them food."" He suggests all the villagers camp out in the meeting hall and prepare for a siege. Then Campbell recruits a ten-member militia to try to attack the first wave of the silicates now approaching the village from the direction of the Phillips house. Morton, Dunley, and Halsey (Keith Bell) are among them. Reluctantly Toni Merrill stays behind--and ironically she finds herself in charge of keeping the villagers organized and, more importantly still, busy.Campbell sends Dunley to take two other men and scout three specific spots on the northern shore of the island. The rest of the island militia, with Stanley and West to accompany them, meet the wave of silicates, using long guns, Molotov cocktails (called ""petrol bombs""), and finally dynamite. Morton dies when he gets too close, and all their measures prove futile.But then Dunley rushes up to inform them that he has found one of the silicates--dead!--and Dr. Phillips' pet Great Dane, half-eaten. Stanley and West drive to the site, with Dunley to guide them. They confirm that they have a dead silicate, loaded with radioactive material, and also the Phillips dog, just as radioactive. (Phillips had written in his log that his dog had gotten an overdose of Strontium-90, a radionuclide that bones would take up.) They drive back to the clinic and meeting hall, where West informs the populace that they might have a means to kill the silicates, but will need the help of everyone present. He then instructs Toni to keep the people busy, while he and Stanley examine their specimen. The dorsal armor is impenetrable, of course, but they are acutely sensitive to radiation poisoning. West then proposes that he and Stanley return to the Phillips house and lab to collect a supply of Strontium-90 and a pressure gun for injecting large animals with. They instruct Campbell to gather the villagers' cattle in his cattle yard to keep them away from the silicates, until they have time to inject them all with strontium. (They then say that if West and Stanley fail in their mission, Campbell and Argyle will have to get the strontium. Peter protests his ignorance, but Campbell tells him not to borrow trouble.)The mission to recover the strontium and the injector succeeds--but West must use the fallen fire ax to cut off Stanley's left hand when a silicate attacks him as they make their escape. West barely manages to apply a tourniquet and then get Stanley back to the clinic. There West, now indisputably in command, operates on Stanley (here Toni assists him as his scrub nurse) and prepares to inject the cattle. He manages to inject them all--except that he must cut the dose of strontium for the last several steers so that he does not run out.Campbell has a problem of his own: Halsey. He has the face to propose, and to an old woman (Margaret Lacey) yet, that they swim for it. Campbell tells Halsey to shut his mouth, assures the people that waiting inside the building is the safest course, and then takes Halsey aside. Speaking as sternly as he knows how, he tells Halsey that if he says one more word, he, Campbell, will knock him out and toss him outside to the silicates.At 2330 hours Irish time, the silicates gorge themselves on the cattle. And then they ""mitose"" for the last cycle. About 200 silicates (probably 224, accounting for one of them dying after the third fission cycle) then attack the building.The lights, over-strained when Campbell and his men strung several lights at the cattle yard, now fail. Toni rushes in breathlessly to ask David what happened to the lights; David tells her that they need to set an example of calm. Halsey panics, says he is ""not staying here,"" and makes for the door--only to meet Peter Argyle, long gun in hand, blocking his way. Campbell does more than that: he fires a gun into the air to get everyone's attention, and instructs everyone to move away from the windows and doors.Three silicates break in through a side window, wrap their tentacles around Halsey, and kill him. Another silicate slithers up the wall, then across the roof, and then onto a skylight, which it then crashes through, killing Dunley beneath it. Campbell now orders everyone out of the room and into the clinic--and must slam the door on an unknown number of villagers when the choice is either them or all the rest! Hastily they barricade themselves in the clinic, only to wait for the silicates, their music now including a high treble cry, to start battering their way in. Toni Merrill, now reduced to a quivering mass of flesh, takes comfort in Stanley's right arm, while West prepares a fatal dose of morphine to use on her to spare her a horrible death. He is just about to ram the needle home when Campbell calls out that the silicates seem to be weakening.Sure enough, that dreadful music is diminishing in volume, loses the triumphal treble quality, and finally falls silent, as the last of the tentacles flop to the floor beyond the door. West waits fifteen seconds, then asks some men to take down the barricade. Setting his teeth, he flings wide the doors, only to see silicate after silicate lying on the corridor floor, dead. He announces his find, and Toni rushes into his arms.The next morning, Mr. Merrill's helicopter comes back to take them off. West promises Campbell that he will send a large crew to clean up the island and bury the dead. (Peter Argyle confirms to Stanley that he and his remaining friends searched the island and found not a single living silicate.) Toni Merrill is obviously a bit wiser for her wear. West tells her not to scare herself all over again, and then observes that they were lucky this happened on an island, otherwise they might never have been able to destroy these creatures.But evidently they have forgotten, for the moment, the part of Phillips' notes where he mentions that similar teams are working in Rome, New York City, and Tokyo. And in the very last scene, a scientist in the Tokyo lab hears the eerie pulsating and sussurating music, goes into his lab to investigate, and cries out in horror as he dies the same kind of death we have already seen...."

He's kidnapping beautiful young women and turning them into mannequins to sell to local stores. Fortunately for Dr Watt, Detective-Sergeant Bung is on the case, and he doesn't have a clue! In this send up of the Hammer Horror movies, there are send-ups of all the horror greats from Frankenstein to Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde.—Simon N. McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> The sinister Dr. Orlando Watt has an evil scheme going. He sends out his plug-in, Frankenstein-like henchman, Oddbod, to kidnap beautiful young women. Once he has them, he uses a petrifying liquid to turn them into mannequins which he can sell to local stores. Fortunately for Dr Watt, Detective-Sergeant Bung is on the case, and he isn't very perceptive. He has his own problems with his wife Emily throwing fits about all the phone calls at night that take him to the police station, interrupting her sleep. Albert Potter stirs things up when he reports that his girlfriend Doris has been snatched. When the police examine the site of the disappearance, they find that one of Oddbod's fingers has broken off. Back at the police lab, a scientist identifies it as from an ancient forerunner of humans. He applies an electric current to see if the finger was recently alive. This stimulates the finger to regenerate a whole new creature - an Oddbod Junior. The police dress one of their detectives as a woman, hoping to catch the snatcher.—Garon Smith Young ladies are being spirited away in the woods by Oddbod, creation of fiendish Dr Watt. Henpecked Sergeant Bung is on the case, but an early lead comes to nothing with the ghastly drowning while at work of lavatory attendant Dan Dann. Bung does seem to be having success with Valeria and her very obvious charms, but completely fails to realise her sinister country house holds the key to the unimaginable horrors going on.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The film opens in Edwardian times in Hocombe Woods, where Doris Mann (Angela Douglas) and Albert Potter (Jim Dale) are courting. When Albert searches the woods for a Peeping Tom, Doris is abducted by a monster named Oddbod (Tom Clegg), which leaves a finger behind. Albert, finding the finger, rushes to the police station and reports the matter to Detective Constable Slobotham (Peter Butterworth), who in turn tells his superior, the henpecked Detective Sergeant Sidney Bung (Harry H. Corbett), who has been investigating similar disappearances in the same woods.After searching the woods for further clues, the group stumble across the eerie Bide-A-Wee Rest Home and are shown to the sitting-room by the butler, Sockett (Bernard Bresslaw). Sockett informs the mistress of the house, Valeria (Fenella Fielding), of their presence, and she awakens her electrically charged brother, Dr. Orlando Watt (Kenneth Williams). Dr Watt speaks to the three men, who are frightened from the house when Dr. Watt vanishes and re-appears when his electrical charge runs down.Basically, Valeria and her brother Watt have perfected some sort of technique to regenerate humans after their death, using electrical charges. Oddbod is one of their creations / an experiment even (Oddbod is a Homo Gargantuan species extinct for 500 years & Dr Watt has brought him alive to learn his secrets), whom they are using to abduct young, nubile girls from the forest and turn them into mannequins.Dr Watt's creations have the ability to re-generate themselves with only a body part, given sufficient electrical charge.
The next day, Bung, Slobotham and Potter interview Dan Dann, a lavatory man (Charles Hawtrey), who once worked at Bide-A-Wee as a gardener. Dan had sent a note to Potter to come and see him for information on the missing woman. Dan is silenced by Oddbod before he can reveal anything.Meanwhile, the police scientist (Jon Pertwee) accidentally creates a second creature-Oddbod Junior (Billy Cornelius)-when subjecting Oddbod's finger to an electrical charge. After killing the scientist, Oddbod Junior makes his way to the mansion, where Valeria and Watt are turning people into mannequins in the manner of House of Wax to sell. Bung arrives at the house, investigating Dann's death but becomes infatuated with Valeria instead.The next day, Potter discovers Doris-in mannequin form-in a milliner's shop but no proof can be found that it really is Doris. Bung returns to the house and discovers evidence that links Valeria and Watt to the mannequin but remains oblivious. Believing him to be on their scent, Valeria and Watt uses a potion to turn Bung into Mr. Hyde and order him to steal the mannequin for them. After recovering the next day, Bung and Slobotham decide to set a trap in Hocombe Woods, with Slobotham disguised as a woman for bait. Bung's sharp-tongued wife, Emily (Joan Sims), follows, thinking Bung to be having an affair and is captured by Oddbod Junior, whilst Slobotham is captured by Oddbod. Bung, now teamed up with Potter, makes his way to the house whilst following their footprints.After failing to dispose of Bung and Potter with a snake, the Oddbods are dispatched to deal with them. Bung and Potter are re-united with Slobotham and manage to return Doris to human form but discover that Emily has been turned into a mannequin. A battle follows, in which Albert (in Mr. Hyde form) defeats the Oddbods. Dr. Watt menaces them with petrifying liquid but is threatened by the re-animated mummy of Rubatitti, which has come alive following a lightning strike. Rubatitti and Watt fall into a boiling vat in the cellar, killing them both. Albert and Doris marry some time later, only to discover that Bung, whose home lacks electricity, is unable to return his wife to human form, and is now living with Valeria."

Is Paris Burning?,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060814/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"August 1944. The Allies are approaching Paris and resistance groups within the city start to plan an uprising against the Germans. However, Hitler wants the city destroyed if it looks like the Allies will take it. This sprawling, star-laden film, depicts the struggles of various French-Resistance factions to regain control of Paris near the end of World War II. The Nazi general in charge of Paris, Dietrich von Cholitz (Fröbe), is under orders from Hitler himself to burn the city if he cannot control it or if the Allies get too close. Much of the drama centers around the moral deliberations of the general, the Swedish ambassador (Welles), and the eager but desperate leaders of the resistance.—Carl J. Youngdahl <zomno@casbah.acns.nwu.edu> August 1944. The Allies are approaching Paris and residence groups within the city start to plan an uprising to aid the liberation of the city. However, Hitler has appointed a new commander in Paris, General von Choltitz, with orders to destroy Paris if it appears the Allies are likely to take it.—grantss In August, 1944, as Allied troops await orders to march into German-occupied Paris, Hitler assigns command of the city to Gen. Dietrich von Choltitz. The Feuhrer's orders are simple and direct--if Paris cannot be held, it is to be burned to the ground. At the same time, the French Resistance movement, which has succeeded in taking possession of two-thirds of the city, is divided over a new plan of strategy. Gen. Jacques Chaban-Delmas, a Free French follower of Charles de Gaulle, strongly opposes those Communists favoring an immediate insurrection, which he fears might turn Paris into another Warsaw. With the help of the Swedish consul, Nordling, he attempts to arrange for the release of an important political prisoner, Bernard Labe, who might succeed in forestalling the uprising; but the plan ultimately fails, and Labe is shot. Word arrives that the Allies have decided to bypass the city and push directly to the Rhine, whereupon the Free French send Major Gallois to convince the Allied High Command that at least one military unit must liberate Paris, thereby enabling Germany to save face and surrender with honor. Von Choltitz, through all of this, procrastinates and ignores Hitler's hysterical demands that the city be burned. Largely responsible for the general's hesitancy is Nordling, who appeals to both von Choltitz' reason and his vanity by pointing out that by refusing to destroy centuries of history merely to satisfy a madman, he would become known as the man who saved Paris. Consequently, the order to burn the city is never given and, on August 25th, American and French soldiers liberate Paris. As von Choltitz is taken prisoner, exultant Parisians surge through the streets to greet the return of General Charles de Gaulle."
The Sword of Doom,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060277/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Through his unconscionable actions against others, a sociopath samurai builds a trail of vendettas that follow him closely. Ryunosuke is a sociopathic samurai without compassion or scruples. When he is scheduled for an exhibition match at his fencing school, the wife of his opponent begs Ryunosuke to throw the match, offering her own virtue in trade. Ryunosuke accepts her offer, but kills her husband in the match. Over time, Ryunosuke is pursued by the brother of the man he killed. The brother trains with the master fencer Shimada. In the meantime, however, Ryunosuke earns the enmity of the band of assassins he runs with, and it becomes a question of who shall face him in final conflict.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> The story follows the life of Ryunosuke Tsukue (Tatsuya Nakadai), an amoral samurai and a master swordsman with an unorthodox style. Ryunosuke is first seen when he kills an elderly Buddhist pilgrim who he finds praying for death. He appears to have no feeling. Later, he kills an opponent in self-defense in a fencing competition that was intended to be non-lethal, but became a duel after he coerced his opponent's wife to have sex with him in exchange for throwing the match and allowing her husband to win. His opponent finds out about the affair prior to the match, and is shown giving his wife a notice of divorce. His rage at Ryunosuke during the match causes him to take an illegal lunging attack after the judge proclaims a draw, and Ryunosuke, the better swordsman, parries and kills him with one stroke of his bokken. Ryunosuke flees town after killing the man, and cuts down many of the dead opponent's clansmen who attack him as he is leaving. His opponent's ex-wife asks to go along with him. To make a living, Ryunosuke joins the Shinsengumi, a sort of semi-official police force made up of ronin that supports the Tokugawa shogunate through murder and assassinations.Through all his interactions, whether killing a man or at home with his mistress and their baby son, Ryunosuke rarely shows any emotion. His expression is fixed in a glassy stare that suggests a quiet insanity.Eventually Ryunosuke learns that the younger brother of the man he killed in the fencing match is looking for him, intent on revenge. He plans to meet this young man and kill him, but before the duel can take place, two events occur that shake his confidence. In a botched assassination attempt, he sees another master swordsman, Shimada Toranosuke (Toshiro Mifune), in action, and for the first time he doubts that his own skill is truly unbeatable. That same night, Ryunosuke's mistress, horrified by his unremitting evil, tries to kill him in his sleep. He kills her in the gardens, to the ominous cries of their sleeping child inside the house, and flees without keeping his appointment to duel with his pursuer. Later he rejoins the gang of assassins at an oiran house in the Shimabara district of Kyoto. There, in a quiet (and he is told, haunted) room, he starts seeing the ghosts of all the people he has killed. Further, he is haunted by the words of Shimada: ""The sword is the soul. Study the soul to know the sword. Evil mind, evil sword."" The final blow comes when he realizes that the apprentice oiran sent to entertain him is the granddaughter of the pilgrim he murdered at the film's beginning.With this realization, Ryunosuke appears to descend into complete insanity. He starts slashing at the shadows of the ghosts that surround him, and then begins attacking his fellow assassins, who seem to number in the hundreds. In one of the longest (seven minutes) and most famous sword fight scenes on film, Ryunosuke kills dozens of gang members in the burning courtesan house as they gradually wear him down with what few wounds they can inflict. Finally it appears that Ryunosuke will surely be killed; bleeding and staggering, his face contorted in rage, he lurches forward, raises his sword once more, and the film ends; a freeze-frame catching Ryunosuke in mid sword-slash."

Married life is proving to be difficult for newlyweds Jenny (Hayley Mills) and Arthur (Hywel Bennett).

Will there ever be any good news?—Kevin Steinhauer <K.Steinhauer@BoM.GOV.AU> A delightful portrait of two young marrieds trying to make a new family unit in the shadow of the old, against nosy villagers, business associates, doting parents, and their own shyness.

But Arthur and Jenny don't know what is causing the issue with Arthur, and they don't want to talk to anyone about it as they fear the embarrassing news spreading around their small town. But they can only keep their problems quiet for so long before rumors start to spread. But Arthur and Jenny's problem is not unique, as the Pipers and Fittons talk about their own marriages, the Fitton's especially with regard to Ezra's childhood friend, Billy.

American version: same as above, only the monsters are named Gargantuas, the green Gargantua had grown from a piece of the brown Gargantua's body, and the brown Gargantua's origin is unknown.—QQQ-2 This is a MUST SEE for any fan of the genre- one of the best. (also see Gojira and Daimajin)
The production quality and cinematography is very good for the budget and the producers put in a real effort to make a ""good movie"" based on the Cain and Abel mythos.
Much darker than other movies of the genre the (the monsters bleed and people get eaten) and the story is very compelling. The fight sequences put the WWF to shame.
Highly recommended for any Giant Monster fan (and possibly Mickey Roarke for a re-make)"

Arabesque,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060121/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Story of international intrigue involving a university professor, an Arab prime minister, a ruthless businessman, a beautiful spy, and hieroglyphics. Professor David Pollock is an expert in ancient Arabic hieroglyphics. A Middle Eastern Prime Minister convinces Pollock to infiltrate the organization of a man named Beshraavi, who is involved in a plot against the Prime Minister. The nature of the plot is believed to be found in a hieroglyphic code. Beshraavi's mistress, Yasmin Azir is a beautiful mystery who becomes intertwined in the plot. Pollock needs her help, but she repeatedly double crosses him in one escapade after another, he can't decide on who she is working for. Ultimately working together, Pollock and Yasmin decipher the message and set out to stop an assassination of the Prime Minister.—E.W. DesMarais <jlongst@aol.com> A man kills Professor Ragheeb and takes a hieroglyphic from his glasses. Then he seeks out the American Professor David Pollock, who is an expert in hieroglyphics at the Oxford University. He invites Pollock to travel to London to meet the wealthy Nejim Beshraavi to translate a cipher in a hieroglyphic, but Pollock declines the work. Soon Pollock is kidnapped while jogging by the Arabian Prime Minister Hassan Jena, who is unofficially in England and asks him to accept the assignment and spy on the activities of Beshraavi who is plotting something. Beshraavi offers 30,000 dollars to Pollock to work in his mansion deciphering the hieroglyphic. Pollock meets Beshraavi's mistress Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), who tells him that he is in danger and Beshraavi will kill him in the end of his work the same way he did with Professor Ragheeb. Pollock and Yasmin flee from the mansion with the hieroglyphic, but he is double-crossed by Yasmin and captured by another interested party Yussef Kasim. Soon the professor is deeply involved in an international conspiracy where everybody wants the cipher and he does not know who is trustworthy.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Mild mannered American David Pollock, a professor of ancient hieroglyphics at Oxford, is hired by Middle Eastern shipping magnate, Nejim Beshraavi, to decode a hieroglyphic written cipher. What Beshraavi is unaware of is that David only took the job as a favor to Middle Eastern Prime Minister Hassan Jena to discover what Beshraavi is up to. David just met Jena for the first time on a clandestine visit to London prior to his official visit to sign a business treaty with the British government in two days' time. Jena tells him that what Beshraavi is asking him to do involves some plot orchestrated by Beshraavi, a countryman of Jena's, against his government. For Jena's security, David is not to disclose to anyone that he is doing this job for Jena, that he has even met Jena, or that Jena is already in London. This job also entails some personal risk to David's life as Beshraavi is not averse to killing to achieve whatever his goal. As David progresses on his task, he is approached by Yasmin Azir, the beautiful owner of the house where Beshraavi is staying and where David is doing the work, who is also Beshraavi's lover. She provides information which suggests that his task is more dangerous than it appears on the surface, as there are more players beyond Beshraavi interested in the cipher and its message, and they will also kill as needed to achieve their goal. However, David, who initially takes her information at face value, will develop doubts about who she is truly working for and why.—Huggo Professor Ragheeb (George Coulouris) is taken aback that his regular optometrist is not working, Sloane (John Merivale), a man who he has never met, is taking his regular optometrist's place. During the eye examination, Sloane places drops in Ragheeb's eyes, blinding him in pain after a few seconds. After Ragheeb collapses and dies on the floor, Sloane takes off Ragheeb's glasses, and breaks them open to reveal a small piece of paper with drawings - seemingly hieroglyphics - on it.At Oxford, Professor David Pollock (Gregory Peck), an American, has taken over an absent Professor Ragheeb's class on ancient hieroglyphics. David shouts out the word sex to wake up one of his sleeping students, Fanshaw (Gordon Griffin). At the end of the class, David is approached by Sloane, now referring to himself as Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane, a supposedly retired British military man now working as the private secretary for Middle Eastern shipping magnate, Nejim Beshraavi (Alan Badel), who would like to see him immediately on a lucrative business matter. David politely declines without knowing the specifics as he has regular plans for his Wednesdays.David is out for a jog when he is kidnapped and forced into a Rolls-Royce limousine. He is taken aback by what just happened, until he notices that one of the men in the limo is Hassan Jena (Carl Duering), the Prime Minister of the Middle Eastern country where Beshraavi lives. David is in awe of Jena. The other man in the back of the limo is Mohammed Lufti (Harold Kasket), Jena's ambassador to Great Britain. Jena asks David to accept Beshraavi's offer so that he can find out what exactly Beshraavi's plans are specifically with some opposition to Jena's government policies. In doing this task, David is not to tell anyone he has met Jena, or that Jena is already in Great Britain. There is also some personal risk to David as Beshraavi is a dangerous man. Regardless, David accepts the assignment due to his admiration for Jena.David meets with Beshraavi in a luxurious house in London, Beshraavi has a menacing presence including a peregrine falcon. Beshraavi asks David to decode a Hittite inscription - the piece of paper Sloane removed from Ragheeb's glasses - for a payment of $30,000. It should take David no more than a few hours, but Beshraavi gives David a veiled threat that he will be a prisoner at the house until the job is complete.In the library of the house, David is eating individually wrapped candies while he works on decoding the cipher. An exotically beautiful woman who David does not know, enters the room unannounced. She is Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), the owner of the house and Beshraavi's lover. Beshraavi, who later enters, infers that David can look but not touch with regard to Yasmin, with whom he was immediately infatuated.There are four at the dinner table: Beshraavi, Yasmin, David and an English businessman named Beauchamp (Ernest Clark). As Yasmin accidentally knocks over a tray, she secretly slips David a few pieces of paper. David accidentally reveals those papers when he drops them on his plate and Beshraavi wants to know what they are. David lies and says it is a prescription and is able to conceal their contents, not wanting to get Yasmin into trouble. David immediately excuses himself, followed closely by Yasmin. Beauchamp and Beshraavi now alone together, Beauchamp remarks that Prime Minister Jena's signing of a business treaty with the British in two days will ruin Beshraavi's shipping business, as it gives the shipping rights to British and American firms. Beshraavi in turn, says that the treaty will not be signed as told to him by a dependable soothsayer.Alone in a bathroom in the house, David reads the two pieces of paper slipped to him by Yasmin, one a news clipping about Professor Ragheeb's accidental death, the other a note from Yasmin asking him to meet her in her bedroom. As David meets Yasmin in her expansive en-suite and she turns on the shower just in case they could be overheard, Yasmin tells David that Beshraavi had Ragheeb killed, and will do the same to David once he decodes the cipher. Their conversation is interrupted as Beshraavi tries to get into the en-suite. As David hides in the shower stall with the water still running, Yasmin lets Beshraavi in. Yasmin and Beshraavi talk about issues such as David's work, and the cipher. Not to arouse Beshraavi's suspicions, Yasmin is forced to take her shower, exposing her naked self to David. Sloane then telephones Yasmin's bedroom phone telling Bashraavi that David and the cipher are missing. Overhearing that conversation from the en-suite, Yasmin confirms from David that he has the cipher in his possession. To hide it and without telling Yasmin, he wraps it in one of the candy wrappers he has been eating, a red wrapper with the number ""9"", which he places in his pocket among some other candy. As some in Beshraavi's employ go searching for David through the house, Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley (Jimmy Gardner) that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge. From that encounter, Hemsley tells Beshraavi that he saw David earlier come into this bedroom. Forced to show himself, David and Yasmin emerge from the en-suite, David seemingly abducting her at scissor-point. They escape together, with one of Beshraavi's henchmen, Mustapha (Larry Taylor), on their trail. That chase takes them to the Zoological Gardens, where among other things Mustapha shoots an aquarium, breaking the glass and emptying the fish inside. Eventually, Mustapha and David get into a struggle, when a man appears from behind and drowns Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster (Duncan Lamont) with CID, he who had placed Yasmin's house under surveillance. When a gardens guard approaches asking about who they are and who will pay for the damages, Webster shoots him. Because of this act, David surmises that Webster is not CID, and can't be working for either Beshraavi or Jena. It is then that Webster reveals that he is working with Yasmin and slugs David on the back of the head with his pistol.David awakens in the back of a moving panel van after being knocked unconscious by Webster back at the gardens. Webster and Yasmin are now with another man, who is in a loving embrace with Yasmin, identifying himself as Yussef Kassim. All he wants to know is where the cipher is. David, seeing that they have emptied out his pockets of the candies with the cipher which are now on a shelf in the van, tells Yussef that Beshraavi has the cipher. They decide to use truth serum on David, after which, in a drugged stupor, he talks what they believe is gibberish about candy and the number ""9"". Believing that he was telling the truth and that Beshraavi has the cipher, Yussef tells Yasmin to work on Beshraavi to find out where it is, while they dump David out of the moving van in the middle of the highway. Still in a hallucinatory drugged state, David is almost killed several times over as he believes he's a bullfighter and the passing cars are bulls. Eventually, he stumbles across a bicycle and cycles away after causing traffic chaos.The next morning, Yasmin arrives back home to Beshraavi's loving embrace. They talk about why David took her hostage - she explaining that it was to escape from Beshraavi's threats to keep him a prisoner at the house until the job was complete - and both David and Mustapha having been killed at Yussef's hands. In the discussion, Yasmin implies that Beshraavi stole the cipher, which was intended for Yussef from Ragheeb, and that Yussef does not yet know the coded message. While Yasmin tells him that neither David or Yussef have the cipher, Beshraavi states that he doesn't have it. He also states that David is not dead, but was seen alive arriving back home on bicycle. Yasmin also tells him that Yussef kept her alive as he thinks she is working with him to get the cipher from Beshraavi. Believing David still has the cipher, Beshraavi sends Yasmin to get it from him as he believes her feminine methods would work better on David than Sloane's more violent ones.At David's apartment, he, still groggy from the drugs, is awoken by the telephone ringing. It is Jena, to who David tells that he doesn't know what's going on with Beshraavi yet, and that he does not have the cipher. Despite his near death encounters, David is re-inspired after speaking to Jena. At the end of their conversation, Yasmin bursts into the apartment. Incredulous that she would show up after doing nothing while watching him almost get killed by her ""boyfriend"" Yussef, Yasmin is able to convince him that she hates Yussef and that the only reason she is in cahoots with him is that his boss, a general back home named Ali orchestrating a military takeover, has her mother and sisters hostage and will kill them if she doesn't cooperate. Likewise, she is only being friendly to Beshraavi on Yussef's orders. She is then able to convince him that what he needs to do is break the code of the cipher so that she can report that information back to the embassy, which will ensure both their safeties. It is then that both realize that neither has the cipher, and that it is likely still in the back of the van.David and Yasmin go to the construction site Yussef uses as his front. They spot the van. Before they can get to it, they see Yussef and Webster heading for the van. Before the two men leave, Webster, hungry, takes all the candy including the one in which David wrapped the cipher. Following Webster as he eats one candy after another, they pick up the discarded wrappers, to see if it is the red number 9 with the cipher. Some of the wrappers are more difficult to get to than others. They watch Webster eat the red wrapped number 9 candy and spot the cipher inside. He goes to a telephone booth to make a call, looking the number up in the telephone booth, meaning that the call is not to Yussef, whose number he already knows. Going to the booth after Webster has left, they see he has scribbled ""3:30"" underneath the listing for Beshraavi Shipping, meaning that Webster has joined forces with Beshraavi and will be meeting him at 3:30. Knowing Beshraavi's routine, Yasmin knows where their meeting place will be.At Ascot race track, a decked out Yasmin is with Beshraavi, while a dapper David is looking for Webster. David and Yasmin are able to talk briefly to make plans to meet at 9 o'clock that evening at Trafalgar Square after David gets the cipher from Webster. David spots Webster rendezvousing with Sloane, to who he will hand over the cipher. David is able to poke the paper out of Webster's hand with his umbrella, the paper flying in the air and landing in the middle of the horse track with the horses in a race approaching. As David and Webster scuffle with each other, Sloane pulls out a blade to stab David. He misses and instead stabs Webster dead who grabs David's name tag as David escapes. David risks his life by running out onto the track to retrieve the cipher. He is able to do so just before the horses gallop by, David running away with cipher in hand. This entire situation is visible not only to the entire crowd but more specifically Yasmin and Beshraavi who are watching with binoculars.On a train, David is tracing a copy of the cipher, but still has not been able to decode it. After he completes the copy, he places the original into a self-addressed stamped envelope which he posts immediately after getting off the train. There, he sees the headlines of the newspaper, which names him as Webster's murderer. He telephones Jena for help in this matter, Jena offers none except for the advice to stay clear of the police, which David does as he notices a bobby heading toward the telephone booth.Yasmin and Beshraavi are back at her house, and he has bought her several pairs of new shoes. As he helps her try on each pair caressing her legs in the process, they discuss what happened at Ascot. He believes this situation is perfect as she can get close to David, find out what decoded message is from him, and bring that information back to Beshraavi. Beshraavi threatens her in the process, implying that he will kill her if she doesn't succeed.David goes to Ragheeb's house, wanting to speak to his widow (Malya Nappi) as he figures that Ragheeb, who was murdered because of the cipher, may have told her what the decoded message is, or at least mentioned where he got it or have some notes somewhere among his possessions about it. He tells her of Ragheeb's death being murder by Beshraavi. Looking at the copy of the cipher, Ragheeb's widow tears it up in frustration, she finally implies that she knew that Ragheeb was working on something dangerous. David also tells her that he is working with Yasmin, her mother and sisters in danger at the hands of General Ali. On this news, Ragheeb's widow states that Yasmin is lying in that she has no mother or sisters, only a father who happens to be General Ali himself.At 9 o'clock that night at Trafalgar Square, David hops into Yasmin's just arrived car and they drive off. They are being tailed by one of Beshraavi's men, but Yasmin is able to lose him. Yasmin, grateful that David is still alive and not in jail, tells him of her discussion with Beshraavi. She asks directly if he still has the cipher. He responds that he no longer needs it as he has decoded the message and makes up a lie based on a billboard sign for Vesta matches he says the cipher is ""The plague shall not pass until the swans fly high in the kingdom of Vesta"". He says he has done his job, he not needing to know what the message actually means. Rather than she dropping him off for his own safety while she goes to the embassy to report the information, he convinces her that it would be safer for him to stay with her, and that she can telephone the information to the embassy at a pay phone, which she does. She in turn convinces him that she does have to go to the embassy to deal with the aftermath, so he that he needs to find his own way from here as the police at the embassy would arrest him on sight. Following their arrangement to meet at the Knightsbridge Hotel where he lies that he is staying, he gets out of the car and she drives away, but he flags down a taxi to follow her. They follow her to Yussef's construction site, she obviously having telephoned him to arrange this meeting. However, hiding in the shadows, David can see Yasmin looking for Yussef in the building, and can see Yussef operating the wrecking ball, he who is planning to kill Yasmin with it. David rushes to save her, just before the wrecking ball comes crashing to where she was standing. Yussef, with wrecking ball, has the two of them on the run through the semi-demolished building, with one near miss after another. David eventually is able to maneuver himself to a spot where the wrecking ball hits an electrical power source, sending a major jolt of electricity through the wrecking ball machine to its cab, electrocuting Yussef to death.As David and Yasmin drive off, they argue, David mad at her for lying about going to the embassy and lying about her mother and sisters, he having got the truth from Ragheeb's widow. Yasmin then figures out why Yussef lured her to the construction site. She tells David that Ragheeb's widow is in cahoots with Yussef, Mrs. Ragheeb who lied to David about Yasmin's family and she who telephoned Yussef to tell him that Yasmin was double crossing him. Once again believing that Yasmin is telling the truth, David confesses that the story he told her of the decoded message was made up, and that he has not yet decoded it.At David's hotel room, David has worked through the night trying to decode the cipher, while Yasmin has been asleep in the bed. He wakes her up with a loving kiss when he has figured it out. It is not Hittite hieroglyphics as he initially believed it to be but rather a simple children's code. The decoded message is the nursery rhyme ""goosee goosee gander"", which is probably a red herring for something else. Remembering that Ragheeb's widow tore up a copy of the cipher upon seeing it, David finally realizes that it is not the drawings themselves, but rather something else on the original piece of paper which contains the message. Retrieving the original from the Hammersmith post office where he mailed it, David, in Yasmin's car while she is driving, tries several theories before he hits the jackpot: the cipher was written with dissoluble ink, which leaves the message remaining after dissolved. What remains is a microdot, which when under a microscope reveals, ""Beshraavi plans assassinate Jena twelve thirty June eighteenth"", which is in twenty minutes time. They don't know where to go until Yasmin sees on a newscast that Jena has just landed at the airport. Facing road obstacles, David and Yasmin are able to make it to the airport a few minutes before 12:30. They, however, have problems trying to gain access to the press conference currently taking place. In the background, Jena, who has just been asked by a reporter about the business treaty he is about to sign with the British government, states that he will not be signing the treaty upon review of its contents. Fighting the police and the crowd, David is able to get to Jena and knock him to the ground, when bullets, from Sloane's machine gun, land where Jena was just standing. Jena is grateful to David for saving his life, David in turn telling him that the coded message stated that Beshraavi was going to kill him. Shocked, Jena asks to speak to David in private. Then, Lufti, as Jena is trying to make his way into a private room, shoots Jena dead. Yasmin whisks David off among the melee. She tries to convince him that the man who was just shot is not Jena. David is incredulous to this as he tells her that he knows Jena, has met him, and talked to him several times in the last few days. Yasmin, who now knows the entire picture of David's involvement, knows now that Beshraavi hired this man to impersonate Jena to David, without Beshraavi disclosing to the impostor that it would be a suicide mission. What tipped Yasmin to he not being Jena was that there was no recognition on his face of who she was, she who is a spy working for the real Jena.Making their way to a surveillance truck monitoring all of Jena's movement upon landing, Yasmin asks to see all the footage shot thus far. Reviewing that footage, Yasmin figures that the switch was made in the car transferring Jena from the plane to the terminal, as he was no longer wearing his trademark slippers after emerging from the window darkened car. Rushing off to where the car is located, they notice a large trunk being transferred from the car to a truck, they figuring Jena being inside the trunk. Yasmin figures Beshraavi needed the fake Jena to denounce the treaty before being killed in order to save his shipping business. Able to slip in the back of the truck as it takes off, David and Yasmin open the locked trunk to find the real Jena inside, bound and gagged but otherwise all right. The truck is headed to Yasmin's house and a waiting Beshraavi. The trunk removed from the truck, David, Yasmin and Jena are able to hide inside the truck while Beshraavi and his men transport the trunk to the house. Beshraavi, however, notices that the trunk's lock is broken. Suspicious, he orders the trunk to be opened right then and there, to find it devoid of Jena. By that time, David, Yasmin and Jena are able to run from the truck but are spotted off in the distance. A chase ensues, first through a low wheat field, where David, Yasmin and Jena are attacked by Beshraavi's men in various harvesting machines, one whose thrashing blades almost kill the three. Arriving at the stables, the three are able to secure some horses and ride away being chased by a Jeep. They escape the vehicle by crossing a stream but Beshraavi and Sloane among others are following them in a helicopter with machine guns in hand. When the three arrive at a bridge, It is blocked at the far end amend David figures they have better cover on foot among the bridge's structure. Beshraavi and Sloane are able to get some shots on the three as they race across the bridge, the helicopter making pass after pass underneath the bridge span. Getting to the mid span, the three are forced to stop due to construction work on the bridge. David, standing up to grab a construction site ladder, is an open target for Beshraavi and Sloane's next pass, who end up missing David. As the helicopter makes its pass right underneath them on the bridge span, David drops the ladder into the helicopter's rotor. Disabled, the helicopter crashes below them into a burning blaze.David and Yasmin are in a romantic mood as they float leisurely in a flatboat on a the water. Oblivious to what is going on around them as they kiss and embrace, they crash into another boat. The male of the male/female couple in the row boat is angry at David, that is until he sees that it is Professor Pollock, the other man being his ""sleeping"" student, Fanshaw. To get the out of their crashed predicament, David uses a pole jabbed into the lake bottom to push off. He pushes too hard, leaving himself suspended on the pole away from the boat. David tells Yasmin he can't swim as he falls into the water. Concerned, Yasmin jumps in to save him. ""Swimming"" David emerges from the water, he telling her that it was his turn to lie. They embrace in the water."
The Quiller Memorandum,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060880/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the West Berlin of the 1960s, two British agents are killed by a Nazi group, prompting British Intelligence to dispatch agent Quiller to investigate. Two British agents are murdered by a mysterious Neo-Nazi organization in West Berlin. The British Secret Service sends agent Quiller to investigate. Soon Quiller is confronted with Neo-Nazi chief ""Oktober"" and involved in a dangerous game where each side tries to find out the enemy's headquarters at any price.—Dirk Bauer <dbauer@gris.uni-tuebingen.de> After two British agents are assassinated in Berlin by a group of Neo-Nazis, the British Secret Service assign Quiller to locate and identify the culprits. He accepts the assignment and almost immediately finds that he is being followed. He begins openly asking question about Neo-Nazis and is soon kidnapped by a man known only as ""Oktober"". The Neo-Nazis want to know the location of British operations and similarly, the British want to know the location of the Neo-Nazis' headquarters. Quiller befriends a teacher, Inge Lindt, whose predecessor at the school had been arrested for being a Neo-Nazi. For Quiller, it's a question of staying alive when he's not in possession of all of the facts.—garykmcd 2 decades after the collapse of Nazi Germany, several old guard are planning to (slowly) rebuild. The West had sent a couple of agents to find out their headquarters, but both are killed. The third to try is Quiller, an unassuming man, who knows he's being put into a deadly game.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil After their first two operatives leading the field mission are assassinated in subsequent order, the British Secret Service recruit Quiller, an American agent, to continue to lead that field operation, namely to discover the base of operations of a new Nazi organization in West Berlin, they whose general members hide in plain sight in blending in with all walks of West German society. Quiller's primary contact for this job is a mid level administrative agent named Pol. With what little information the British operatives are able to provide him especially in his most recent predecessor, Kenneth Lindsay Jones, working alone without backup against advice, Quiller decides to take a different but potentially more dangerous tact than those predecessors in showing himself at three places Jones was known to be investigating, albeit in coded terms, as the person who has now taken over the mission from Jones in the probability that the Nazis will try to abduct him for questioning to discover what exactly their opponents know or don't know, and to discover in turn their base of operations in West Berlin. The ploy works as one, two or all three of those places were where the Nazis did learn about Quiller, who they kidnap. Without knowing where they have taken him, and even if it is indeed their base of operations, Quiller is playing an even more dangerous game as in the process he met schoolteacher Inge Lindt, who he starts to fall for, and as such may be used as a pawn by the Nazis to get the upper hand on Quiller.—Huggo"

My secret spy camera has taken pictures of you all through your clothes. Unless you release me, your naked photos will be sold in every school yard in Tokyo within the hour. Unless you are totally comfortable with your body, you must release me."" Very funny, but also very unusual.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>"
Queen of Blood,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060877/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The year is 1990. An alien species makes contact with Earth through radio transmissions. After astronauts from earth venture to the planet, they find one - a female, who's mute. As they transport her back to earth, one by one, the male crew members die. It's too late when they realise she needs their blood to survive.—Markus Torpvret <torpvret@erlang.ericsson.se> It's the year 1990 and scientists receive a distress call from an alien spaceship that has crash-landed on Mars. Dr Farraday (Rathbone) decides to send a team of astronauts, including Allan Brenner (Saxon) and Paul Grant (Hopper), on a rescue mission. On the planet, they discover just one survivor. This green-skinned alien is brought aboard, but when one man is attacked and drained of his blood, the survivors are soon racing home, before they too become victim to the bloodsucker.—Film_Fan The movie opens with title and credits shown over watercolor paintings, consisting mostly of red, brown and black, of an other-worldly landscape (painting of John Cline). A narrator tells us, ""The year 1990, the problem of traveling to the moon has been solved for many years. Space stations have been built there and authorized personnel come and go as they wish, but the moon is a dead world. And the great question about space still remains, does life exist on another planet? To seek an answer to this question, the major powers of the world have been actively preparing at the International Institute of Space Technology to explore the planets Venus and Mars."" Allan Brenner (John Saxon) enters the Astro Communications office to see Laura James (Judi Meredith) for a lunch date. She has been monitoring signals believed to be from another planet in our galaxy.On an alien world, we see their sun set over a beach. Their counterparts to ours on Earth are sending signals out into space. Their technology is equal to, or greater than our own. Allan and Laura finish their lunch outside as Paul Grant (Dennis Hopper) on the left and Tony Barrata (Don Eitner) on the right join them at their table. They barely start their lunch when an announcement is made calling all personnel to assemble for an important message from Dr. Farraday (Basil Rathbone). The four are joined on their walk to the assembly by Cmdr. Anders Brockman (Robert Boon). Farraday tells the assembled that they have deciphered the message send by another civilization in space. An ambassador will be dispatched to Earth from their planet. On the alien planet a ship is prepared and launched. It is a spherical shaped craft with a belt of two metal tubes near the bottom. The aliens are human-like in their appearance. An alien probe is sent to Earth prior to the main ship's arrival and lands in the ocean. The capsule is retrieved and sent to the IIST labs for study. A record of the alien ship's entire flight is included in the probe. Farraday and his assistant (Forrest J. Ackerman) enter the Communications office and confer with Laura. Laura plays the alien transmission of their flight, including the crash landing on Mars. Farraday believes there may be survivors on the alien ship. Farraday calls a press conference for the next morning.Farraday proposes a rescue mission using the spaceship, Oceano, and to push up the schedule six months. Supply ships are sent to the moon. Farraday and his staff have moved to the moon to supervise the rescue mission. Laura is unhappy that Allan Brenner will not be on the Oceano rescue ship with her. The rescue ship is launched and Allan watches it depart in his spacesuit from the surface of the moon. Brockman reports a successful launch to Farraday. Brockman reads a book, as Paul Grant and Laura James get their meal. Before they can eat the ship encounters a sunburst that damages some of the ship's instruments. Laura contacts Farraday and reports that they have entered the orbit of Mars using emergency instruments. They begin their search for the alien's ship. They find it and report same to Farraday. The Oceano lands on Mars not far from the alien ship. Brockman and Grant don their space suits and walk over to the alien ship. Brockman enters the disabled alien craft only to discover the crew dead. Back on Earth, a newspaper headline announces, ""Successful Landing on Mars; Alien Spaceship Discovered."" Another article is titled, ""Single Dead Astronaut Found on Spacecraft; Mystery Deepens."" On the Moon base, Brenner and Tony Barrata propose taking the smaller rocket, Meteor, to Mars and deploying the search satellites immediately. Farraday explains that the Meteor can only carry a small amount of fuel, not enough to land on Mars, let alone return to Earth. Brenner explains they will land on Phobos, and then take the rescue ship to the surface and return on the Oceano. Farraday agrees to consider the plan. He finally agrees and the Meteor arrives in orbit around Mars. The satellite is deployed and the Meteor lands on the tiny moon, Phobos. Brockman calculates that the Meteor must depart within thirty minutes or they will be stuck on the tiny moon for a week. As luck would have it, the Meteor landed close to the other alien ship, the rescue ship, the one thought to have landed somewhere else on Mars. Brenner and Barrata walk to the rescue ship. They find the sole occupant, a woman in a spacesuit and carry her back to the Meteor. The Alien Queen (Florence Marly) is placed in a seat while Brenner and Barrata decide who will remain behind, as the craft can only carry two. Brenner crash lands on Mars and carries the Queen back to the Ocean. Brockman and Grant go out to find Brenner and the Queen, now lost in a sandstorm. The storm passes and Grant enters the Oceano carrying the Queen. She is wearing a red spacesuit that is quite form fitting. We can see her skin is a greenish color, but otherwise she is quite human in appearance. Laura asks, ""Paul, who brought her?"" Before Grant can answer, the door opens and Allan Brenner walks in. Brockman explains there is not enough fuel to stop on Phobos to retrieve Tony Barrata. He conveys his concern to Farraday who assures Brockman that a rescue ship will be dispatched to rescue Barrata, but Tony will need to conserve his emergency rations.The Alien Queen begins to come to. The first person she sees is Paul Grant. She smiles at Paul, next at Cmdr. Brockman and finally at Allan. She registers her approval with a toothy grin. But when Laura steps up there is a marked change in her countenance. The crew takes note of this. Brockman assigns the task of seeing to the passenger to Paul Grant. ""I thought of suggesting it to Laura, but it seems our visitor doesn't get along very well with her own sex."" The Oceano departs Mars and the crew goes about their duties. Paul is showing the Alien Queen how to drink water from a bottle. We now get a good look at the so called ambassador. She is very human-like in her appearance, except for the greenish cast to her skin. Her hair is white, cut short, lacquered, and pulled to a point near the back of her head. She drinks the water, but refuses solid food. It is clear Paul is enjoying his duty. Brockman wants to study her blood. He thinks it may be high in chlorophyll. When Laura gives him a syringe, and the Queen sees the needle, she recoils in horror. She knocks it to the cabin floor, breaking it. Brockman observes, ""This is more than some childish fear of the needle. Perhaps she has an extremely low pain threshold. Perhaps...But we mustn't do anything that may affect her health adversely. She is probably the most valuable specimen for scientific research in the history of our planet. To get her back to Earth safely has to be our first consideration."" The sleep period buzzer sounds and Paul is assigned the first watch. Paul records his notes on tape. He hears a strange buzzing sound, like a hive of bees. He walks back to investigate. The Queen places her hand on his shoulder. When he turns to look at her, she is smiling, but her eyes have lit up. Paul is mesmerized and she approaches him.The next morning, Brockman enters the cabin and sees Paul. He thinks Paul is asleep. He tries to wake the crewman, but Paul slumps over in his chair. Brockman calls to Laura and Allan to help. Brockman pronounces Paul dead. Laura goes back to check on the passenger. An examination of Paul's wrist shows a wound and a lot of blood. Laura's scream brings her crew mates back to the passenger. The Queen is asleep; her mouth shows a trickled of blood on the corner. Brockman says, ""Now we know how she feeds at least."" ""She's a monster,"" Allan replies. Allan wants to destroy the passenger, but Brockman disagrees and explains he will feed her with blood plasma. Laura reports the findings to Farraday. Paul Grant's body is disposed of in space. Allan is troubled by the fact that there was no sign of a struggle. Brockman speculates that some anesthesia in her saliva allowed her to feed with no resistance by Paul. Brockman and Laura give her the first taste of blood plasma. Brockman records his notes on tape. He concludes that the plasma seems to satisfy her hunger for blood, but adds that they ran out of plasma and will need to provide blood donations from the remaining crew. He stops and notices the alien in her room and the strange buzzing sound from the same location. She approaches the commander. He pulls a gun and points it at her. He drops the gun and stares into her eyes.The next day, with Brockman dead, there is no one to countermand Allan's action to immobilize the alien vampire. He ties her to a chair and tells the unconscious creature, ""When you wake up this time you won't be able to move."" Allan is now convinced she must have hypnotized her prey before killing and consuming their blood. Farraday wants Brockman's body returned for autopsy. During the next sleep cycle, Laura sleeps while Allan remains awake and reads a book. The Queen awakes and using some power, burns the ropes securing her arms to the chair. She walks past a sleeping Laura and heads towards Allan. Laura awakes in a start and gets up. She notices the ropes and the empty chair, but only slowly walks to the control room. There she spots the alien crouched over Allan, feeding on his blood. The two scuffle and in the process, Laura scratches the alien's back. When the Queen notices her own green blood on her hand, she runs away shrieking. Allan is on the floor and regains consciousness as Laura treats the wound on his wrist. He asks, ""She got to me didn't she?"" Laura explains that they fought and she ran away. The pair go to check on their visitor. The alien is laying on a bed with one arm brushing the cabin floor. A puddle of green fluid is below her outstretched arm. Allan observes that she is dead and why she wouldn't allow the blood sample; she's a hemophiliac. She bled to death.The Oceano approaches and lands on Earth. When Laura opens a cabinet to retrieve goggles she discovers that it is filled with red pulsating eggs sitting in a green gel. All the pieces come together for Allan. He concludes, ""That's it. That's why they sent her. She wasn't just an ambassador, she was a Queen. A Queen Bee. Maybe this is how their society is set up. A Queen who does all the breeding. Or maybe their planet was dying and they just sent her to bring her kind to Earth. Laura, we have to destroy these."" Laura reminds Allan that it is up to the scientific community to study and control this remarkable find. Laura notices more eggs when she opens another cabinet. Farraday enters with his staff and they retrieve the eggs. We close with a close-up of the red, pulsating eggs on a tray, followed by the cast credits."

Ellsworth hires cowboy Sam ""Bulldog"" Burnett to transport Vindicator to Texas to Bowen's ""fort"".

He asks that they make a pact that if he can convince Aura that Sergio will leave.Aura comes in and tells Fabrizio it is time for the bath. He points out that Sergio has come back and tells her to welcome him with a kiss. She approaches Sergio as if to kiss him but whispers  thank you.Aura prepares the bath and Fabrizio tells Sergio that he was destitute when he first came but that the old lady gave him everything he has now. He tells Aura to pour a drink for Sergio, which she does. She goes back into the bathroom and changes into a robe as Sergio watches through the door. He tells Fabrizio that it is time for him to leave them alone. Fabrizio says it is time for his bath and goes in. Sergio approaches Aura and they begin kissing on the bed.

Sergio leaves.Fabrizio and Aura are seen fencing (they are wearing no masks). He gives her some instructions. They look over and see Sergio watching them. Fabrizio gives her an epée and they resume. He strikes her epée down and teases her with the tip of the blade. Sergio rushes over to her aid, but is rebuffed by Fabrizio, who tells him to stop being a hero. She excuses herself and leaves. Sergio tells Fabrizio that he is tormenting her and keeping her as a slave. Fabrizio answers that she likes him, which is disputed by Sergio. Telling Fabrizio that he will take the job, Sergio is told that the job belongs to Fabrizio. Sergio says he will ask Consuelo.They enter Consuelos quarters and Fabrizio tells her that Aura is pleased with him. She asks Sergio what he wants and he begins to tell her that he wants the job, but is interrupted by Fabrizio, who insists that she tell Sergio he is not wanted or needed. She replies that the decision is hers to make. Asking if Sergio approves of the pay and agrees to live in the palace, she hires him and tells him to remove Fabrizio. He tells Fabrizio to pack his bags and leave. This infuriates Fabrizio, who turns to see Aura looking in. He goes after her. Consuelo tells Sergio to go after him.Seeing the elevator going up, Sergio takes the stairs and ends up in the library, calling for Aura. The lights go out and he looks around, finding a sabré which has been stabbed into the mummified corpse. Muffled screams are heard. As Sergio runs through the darkened library, he sees Fabrizio grab Aura and run out of the room. He chases after them. Hearing them nearby, he pushes away books from a shelf and sees them embracing. Aura reaches out to Sergio, who fights with Fabrizio. In the struggle Fabrizio is killed. When Sergio informs the women he will have to report this accidental death to the police, Consuelo tells him no and to dispose of the body. He insists he will tell but is told that they will testify that he came in and violently attacked them. Sergio realizes they are working together and that he has been used to kill someone they no longer wanted around. Stunned, he offers disbelief. Both women insist that he must do as he is told.Sergio is told to put the body in the trunk of Consuelos car because his is too small. Then he is given a roll of heavy tape and told to do as he was instructed so that the body will not be identifiable. Sergio takes the body to nearby railroad tracks and tapes the arms to the rails, positioning the head so the train will run over it. He hides in the bushes and checks his watch as he waits for the train. A man is seen crossing the tracks with a bicycle. The train roars through and Sergio returns to the palazzo.He tells Aura that everything went as planned and that he is leaving. He will tell no one about this. She professes that she wants him. He tries to leave but is irresistibly drawn to her. Consuelo tells him that now that he has proven his worth, she is able to reveal that Aura is not her daughter.The three are seen eating with Sergio watching. Aura and Consuelo have almost identical hand movements. They rise and look at Sergio. Consuelo says she is cold and for Aura to go and see if a window is open. As she leaves, strange music is heard. Consuelo comments on the music and Sergio calls for Aura. Consuelo pours another cup of the potion tea and drinks it as Sergio comes back into the room. He questions why she drinks it if it is harmful. She begins chanting, saying that it is life. She begins ritual dancing and speaking Italian. He asks where she has sent Aura. The dancing continues and Consuelo tells him to look in the dark. Aura is seen emerging from the shadows and begins a sensual dance. Both women are seen dancing as Sergio watches. Aura begins writhing on her knees until finally Sergio cries out for it to stop. The music stops but Consuelo is not seen. Aura approaches him and they go to Fabrizios bedroom.Sergio tells her he would prefer to go to her bedroom, but she insists that this is her bedroom and that they will be together forever here. Sergio turns and sees Consuelo watching. He angrily tells her to get her ugly face away and stop watching. Aura, undressed and sitting in bed, turns out the light. He tries to turn it back on, but she insists she prefers the dark. She lies down and begins moaning, clutching the bed frame.He wakes the next morning alone in bed. Consuelo tells him that Aura is not there, but that she told her last night how happy she was. She asks Sergio if he is happy and he agrees. She tells him that she is afraid that something will happen to interfere with that happiness. She brings his breakfast on a tray and clothes for him to wear. She tells him that the newspaper reports nothing bad. He is told to begin work in the library that day.Sergio goes outside as the city bells are ringing. Glancing down, he sees Consuelo dragging a cat by a rope around its neck. He goes into the fencing room and finds Aura, kissing her and telling her he missed waking up with her. He says he wants to take her away and leave Consuelo behind. She insists that this is her home and that he will not be able to persuade her otherwise. Saying she misses Fabrizio and his fencing, she tries to get Sergio to fence with her. He refuses and takes away her foil. She draws two epées and gives one to him. He kicks it away and takes hers away from her. They argue over the mention of Fabrizios name, which he never wants to hear again. He slaps her a few times, asking to know the truth. She says she will go away, leaving him alone with Consuelo. He locks the door and demands to know who she really is. She asks for him to let her out. He throws away the key. She runs from door to door but they are all locked. Exhausted, she sinks to the floor and begins twitching. He asks what is wrong. She contorts on the bed and Sergio calls for Consuelo. She tells him to leave her alone and retreats into the closet behind clothes. He calls to her and pulls aside the clothes. Consuelo is revealed. She tells him that she transforms herself into Aura for his pleasure and to give her time.Unbelieving, he runs around the house, calling for Aura. Unable to find her, he goes into the greenhouse and sits to wait. Outside a raging thunderstorm begins. He hears the womans voice calling him. He turns and sees Aura in the distance. She approaches him. Consuelo is also seen, warning him not to imprison Aura again. She must be free to come and go. She bids him come back to the house. Aura says he will be able to see and touch her because the witch wills it to be so.Later he is seen watching a woman hanging clothes on a clothesline and singing. He goes to his desk in the library but pulls his knees up into the chair. Next he is seen praying for strength just as Fabrizio did. Consuelo hears him and tells him he is pathetic. She asks why he doesnt leave and get another job. He answers that he is happy here. He asks if she remembers the last lines her husband wrote. She tells him to return the book to the library. He quotes lines from the journal which tells of his wife having reincarnated someone. Rushing into her room, he tells her the last words of her husband were that he was afraid of her and wanted to know what she had become. What happened to him, Sergio asks her? She tells him that he committed suicide. She asks him to zip her dress and to take some things to the antique store to sell. He begs her to bring back Aura whom he has not seen for several months. He pours a cup of the tea and tries to force her to drink it. She reminds him that only she can bring Aura back and that he should not make her angry.As he is carrying a statue to the antique dealer, Marta pulls up in a car and calls to him. Selling the statue, he is seen collecting the money and going back to the palazzo. Marta tries to question him, but he seems disinterested and wonders how she found him. She says she was just on her way to the antique dealer and saw him. He goes back into the house where Consuelo is leaving. Giving her the money, she remarks how his former friend seems to want him. She says she doesnt know when she will be back and leaves. Marta tries to prevent him from closing the door but is unable.Sulking in the library, he hears Auras laughter and goes to investigate. She is seen lying on a couch. She gets up and tells him it is because of the new man. Sergio looks and sees a new young man (Ivan Rossamov) who has answered a newspaper ad. She tells him to tell the young man to leave, but he insists that it is he who will leave. She tries to persuade him to stay, claiming it is he that she wants. He says that is what he was told when he came there to work. She wants him to tell the new man to go and that he should not believe what Consuelo tells him. When she tells him that she loves him, he tells her to wait.Tying up Consuelos hands, he drags her outside to the iron gate and binds her hands to it with wire. Meanwhile the new man calls for Aura, who disappears into the dark. Sergio brings small palettes and wooden cases to build a fire under the witch. He then pours wine over the wood and lights it. As the witch screams  No!  he sits a short distance away to watch. The young man, having come outside, sees this. In the flames, Consuelos face turns to Aura as Sergio watches her burn."

When James (Ian Bannen) met Penelope (Natalie Wood) at a club, it took all of three weeks before they were married. But after the marriage, other women became attracted to James and he kept getting promoted, which took him away from Penelope. So Penelope puts on a disguise and robs her husband's bank. Her psychiatrist, Greg (Dick Shawn), believes that this condition is caused by James being over worked and under romantic with Penelope. She also tells Greg that she robs the business associates of James. But Greg is in love with Penelope - in fact everyone likes her. The problem is when she confesses to her crimes, no one believes her.—Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com> Donning a disguise, Penelope Elcott (Natalie Wood) has just successfully robbed the bank where her husband James Elcott (Ian Bannen) works as its president.

After the Fox,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060200/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An Italian criminal mastermind, impersonating a film director, plans to grab the loot on a beach where a bogus movie is being filmed. Peter Sellers plays Aldo Vanucci (aka the Fox), one of the greatest criminals of the world and master of disguise. After Aldo escapes from the Italian prison he was held in, he meets again with his friends and plans to retrieve the ""gold of Cairo"", a large shipment of gold that waits to be unloaded somewhere in Italy. Aldo devises the perfect plan- posing as a famous director, he finds the ideal coastal village to unload the shipment, and persuades the entire population that he has chosen their village as the set for his new movie. Everybody, including the idiot chief of the local police is so excited, that they can't even imagine that in fact they are helping the Fox to get the ""gold of Cairo""...—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> One of the greatest heists ever has just been committed, known as the Great Gold Robbery of Cairo. Interpol knows whoever the robbers, unknown to them led by a man named Okra, have the three hundred gold bars weighing two tons on a ship destined for Europe, the issue for the robbers in how to smuggle them through whatever port they have chosen. Interpol knows that only a handful of criminal masterminds would be able to handle the smuggling job, the most-likely candidate being Italy-based Aldo Vanucci despite he being in prison and thus in semi-retirement. Despite Vanucci knowing that he could break out of prison at any time, he has no desire to do so, that is until he learns that his sixteen year old younger sister, Gina Vanucci, has purportedly grown into a loose young woman, he wanting to break out more to ensure she conducts herself in a proper manner. After breaking out, he decides to take the job in coming up with a plan stemming from Gina, who has taken the stage name Gina Romantica, trying to break into the movies, and the arrival into Italy of former American movie star Tony Powell, who does not want to admit to the world that he is far past his prime: to go undercover as movie director Federico Fabrizi in making a movie starring Gina and an oblivious Powell centered around the actual smuggling of the gold bars through the small seaside town of Sevalio. He will use the unwitting townsfolk, including the mayor and police chief, as extras, in they all just wanting to be in the movies, while in reality they will be assisting in the actual smuggling. While the Italian police are after Aldo solely for the escape, he may have other problems in carrying out the plan successfully like actually having to make a movie.—Huggo The Fox is a criminal mastermind vacationing in one of Italy's finest prisons sending care packages home with each visitor. When he finds that his little sister has begun to discover boys and that his dim witted men don't think they can handle her, he vows to escape. After he eludes the manhunt, he accepts a job to smuggle gold into the country for which he assembles an entire movie company, including an aging star (Victor Mature) for cover as he manages to stay several steps ahead of the authorities. Little sister, in her own way manages to keep up with him nicely.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Released in the US as ""After The Fox"", Caccia Alla Volpe is a 1966 collaboration of Vittorio De Sica and Peter Sellers. In this light romp Sellers plays Italian Master Thief Aldo Vanucci who escapes from prison to help his mother control his precocious young sister and to take part in smuggling gold bullion into Italy. With the Carabiniere always on his tail, Vanucci concocts a scheme to pose as Fellini-esque movie director Federico Fabrizzi filming a neo realistic film in a small Italian coastal town where he plans to receive the gold. Many icons are sent up in this film. De Sica himself shows he is not above a little self parody, Fellini of course gets jabbed and probably most notably, Victor Mature briefly came out of retirement to play handsome Tony Powell, a hilarious and thinly veiled caricature of himself, an aging over the hill star of the 40's desperate to recapture his former starpower complete with his signature trench coat.Britt Ekland, Sellers then wife, stars as his naive and starstruck little sister Gina Vanucci who renames herself Gina Romantica and is a willing dupe in her brother's scheme. Martin Balsam stars as Harry, Powells exasperated agent and Akim Tamiroff gets in on the self parody playing yet another greasy fez wearing villain.Fabrizzi snows everyone in the Italian town of Sevalio who are desperate to be in a movie including a gullible chief of police who unwittingly helps him dazzled by promises of a film career for himself.Needless to say, the plan unravels with a few amusing surprises along the way. Certainly a must see for Sellers, Ekland and Mature fans. The film is complemented by music by Burt Bacharach and Hal David including a performance of the title theme ""After The Fox"" by then popular British group, The Hollies."

Hymie Kelly, perhaps Frankie's oldest friend and confidante and who is also in the audience, recounts Frankie's rise from their humble and what may be seen as unsavory beginnings to this night. Frankie fell into acting by accident, but his foray into it was based on some talent, especially in roles most closely mirroring his own cutthroat personality and streetwise background, upon which he could draw. As his fame increased, he believed there was no way that trajectory could change course, and even if there was a hint at that happening, that he would do whatever required to get out of that hole.

Lt. Col. Pierre Raspeguy, who led a paratrooper unit in Indochina, loses his command in his open mistrust of his superiors, but is given the new assignment of leading the 10th Regiment in Algeria largely on the strength of the respect of the men in his unit as documented by the unit's official/unofficial historian, Capt.

It's up to disgraced SIC agent Bill Dexter to stop Goldfoot.—Woodyanders The foppish mad scientist Dr. Goldfoot (Vincent Price) plots another mad scheme to take over the world by killing off the major military leaders of every country; to that end, he creates in his secret lab a bevy of bodacious girl bombs; full-length, life-size robots that explode when embraced. A French military officer in Paris is killed, as is an Italian general in Rome, Italy.Goldfoot's plans become compromised when the mysterious deaths arouse the suspicions of Bill Dexter (Fabian), a former member of the Security Intelligence Command (S.I.C.) who has been expelled from the organization for being too much of a lady's man at seducing all or most of the female employees of the company. Dexter is sent to Rome to investigate the latest killing my one of the so-called ""girl bombs"".While following Dr. Goldfoot through Rome, Dexter runs into two dim-witted hotel doorman, named Franco (Franco Franchi) and Ciccio (Ciccio Ingrassia), who have aspirations toward becoming secret agents. Goldfoot positions one of his girl bombs, an exact duplicate of a lovely hat-check girl, in the hotel where Franco and Ciccio work. The hotel is playing host to an important Belgian General, and Goldfoot knows that the military man will be unable to resist the allure of his girl bomb. Before Dexter can do anything to stop this plan, he is attacked by the simpleton Franco and Ciccio who mistakenly think that Dexter is a foreign spy. In the ensuing confusion, the Belgian general, ""bites the dust.""Soon afterwards, a NATO officer, General Willis (Vincent Price in a dual role), is abducted by Dr. Goldfoot. Apart from being the last surviving NATO general, Willis also happens to the dead splitting image of Dr. Goldfoot albeit with a very noticeable stammer, and a black eye patch over his right eye. Willis is killed soon after by one of the girl bombs, and Dr. Goldfoot plots to take his place at an important conference.When Goldfoot receives information that a secret meeting is being held at SIC headquarters, he has the room electronically bugged. General Benson (Francesco Mulé) and his associates determine that the only way to catch the man responsible for these bizarre killings is to assign their two best agents to the task. Using a high-tech computer, named Rita, General Benson decides it is the best way to determine the two best SIC agents will be flawlessly chosen. But Dr. Goldfoot sabotages the computer, and the two agents selected to carry out the job are none other than Franco and Ciccio.Meanwhile, General Benson's secretary, Rosanna (Laura Antonelli), convinces Dexter to assist Franco and Ciccio in their investigation. What Dexter fails to realize that he too is being monitored by Goldfoot, who fears that the young man might be more capable than he appears to be. Goldfoot also takes an interest in Rosanna, and has one of his henchmen kidnap her when Dexter leaves her apartment. She is subsequently replaced by a duplicate girl bomb. When Dexter returns to her apartment that same evening, he finds a definite changes in Rosanna's behavior. Whereas she had earlier slapped him across the face for making a pass at her, she now appears seductive and passionate in her disposition. Though Dexter is charged with excitement over the case, the girl bomb does her best to lure him into an embrace, even resorting to an impromptu striptease. But Dexter sees through her disguise and avoids the trap set by Dr. Goldfoot. The duplicate Rosanna is subsequently shorted out in an accident, while Dexter goes in search of the real Rosanna.Having earlier been tipped off by Dexter that Dr. Goldfoot is hiding out in a mansion in the countryside, Franco and Ciccio decide to upstage him by raiding the place and taking full credit for its discovery. When they arrive with General Benson and the authorities, the only find that the place is a private school girls. In fact, this is yet another deceptive illusion arranged by the diabolical doctor, with the girl bombs posing as passive students, and the doctor himself posing as a matron (with his beard concealed by a black veil). Satisifed that the entire trip was a false alarm, Benson and his men depart. Franco and Ciccio decide to stay behind and in so doing, they are captured by Dr. Goldfoot and his henchmen. They break free, and the henchmen search the mansion for them. Franco manages to escape by posing an a girl bomb. Dr. Goldfoot is surprisingly fooled by Franco's disguise when he rationalizes the strange looking girl bomb as being the result of failing to ""oil the machine"". But Ciccio is trapped when he unsuccessfully attempts to impersonate Goldfoot's reflection in a fake mirror (shades of the classic 'mirror scene' from the Marx Brother's 'Duck Soup').That night, Franco returns to the mansion with Dexter to try to rescue Ciccio and Rosanna. In the interim, Ciccio has been duplicated with a 'guy bomb' and Rosanna has, literally, been kept in cold storage. Dexter retrieves Rosanna, and after battling it out with Ciccio's duplicate, the two inept doormen are once again reunited.His plans for world domination still in place, Dr. Goldfoot attempts to flee with his secretary Hardjob, and his henchman Fong. A hilariously silly, climatic mad chase ensures, leading through such picturesque sights as the Roman Coliseum (which is slightly damaged when Goldfoot smashes his car into one of the pillars), the Trevi Fountain (which Dr. Goldfoot stops for a second to throw a coin in the fountain for good luck), and an amusement park. The chase culminates in the air with Goldfoot boarding a US B-52 aircraft under the guise of General Wilson, and Dexter and his cohorts pursing them in a hot air balloon. Landing the balloon on the wing of the plane, Dexter and the others foil Goldfoot's escape. The three heroes battle it out with the henchmen, but Dr. Goldfoot takes advantage of the commotion by quietly donning a parachute and bailing out. Before he escapes, however, Goldfoot sets the control panels of the plan on a course for Moscow; once it reaches the designed sights, the bomb doors will open and a nuclear ""super bomb"" will be released on the Kremlin. While Dexter tries to take control of the plane, Franco and Ciccio head into the bomb compartment to try do defuse the bomb. They manage to disarm the bomb, but the bomb doors open prematurely, and they are dropped into the heart of Siberia, riding the bomb like a horse (shades of 'Dr. Strangelove').Back in Rome, Dexter has just been reinstated as a member of SIC, while he starts making plans to rescue Franco and Ciccio from Siberia. But a phone call arrives from President Lyndon Johnson to General Benson telling him that the rescue plans have been scrapped and that the entire incident must be kept top secret and never to be released publicly. Dexter is emotionally devastated, but plots not to give up, even if he has to go on alone to rescue Franco and Ciccio. At the Rome airport as he is preparing to depart back to the USA, Dexter bids Rosanna goodbye and tells her he will write. Although she knows he won't as his womanizing ways still plague him as he ogles a pretty flight attendant that boards with him on the Pan Am airplane.In the final scene, Franco and Ciccio are happily residing in a Soviet prison camp in frozen, snow-covered Siberia. They are approached by the director of the prison camp who offers them their freedom in going back to Italy if they become double agents in working with the Russian spy service. Both Franco and Ciccio willingly agree to do so in part to get away from the cold of Siberia to begin training for working for the Soviet Union. It is shown that the Russian prison camp director is none other than..... Dr. Goldfoot."

Although the Nazis do not fully trust him, especially Lieutenant Keller, they do come to an agreement. He specifically signs an exclusive contract with Baron Von Grunen, who will be his handler. The contract is so the Baron can retain control over Eddie. Eddie is given the code name Franz Grauman, and all electronic correspondence he is to end with ""XXX"" as a sign that he is all right.

Scotland Yard assign Police Inspector Jim Elliott (Leo Genn) to the case but there initially seem to be few leads. However, just when the trail seems to have gone cold a curious potential lead comes to Elliott's attention from a rural area of southern England. Some of the stolen bank notes from the robbery seem to have turned up at businesses in the vicinity of the winter quarters of Barberini's travelling circus - which Elliott remembers were performing in London at the time of the robbery.Elliott initially goes undercover as a photographer to visit the circus and speak to owner Barberini (Anthony Newlands) but soon has to dispense with his cover when the body of one of the armoured car robbers turns up inside a sack at the circus.

They enter the fort and discover one survivor - Beau Geste - who we next see recovering in the infirmary.In a flashback, we see the day he mustered into the Legion. At assembly, Sgt. Dagineau addresses several recruits, including Boldini, who is known to the Sergent from a prior enlistment. Dagineau reads from an unsigned letter which was found on his desk from someone who claims that he will shoot Dagineau in the back during a battle to settle a score. Dagineau suspects it is Beau, who he calls ""Graves"" initially. From the parade ground, the film cuts to Lieutenant De Ruse's office, where Dagineau and he speak about the letter. Dagineau believes it to be from an educated man who will reveal himself. The Lieutenant suggests it is unfair to punish all for the deed of one.Cut to the men in their barracks. Boldini, who is a stereotypical Italian ""fast talker"", suggests that someone should confess to writing the letter to make things easier on everyone. There is tension and Boldini becomes the target of suspicion, having previously been in the legion with Dagineau. Cut to a montage of grueling training and a scene where Dagineau has four men, including Beau and Boldinin, march blindfolded toward a cliff to demonstrate obeying orders.

De Ruse reveals that he knows who Beau really is from a picture that appeared in a newspaper story about an American businessman who had disappeared after confessing to having embezzled money. We learn that several weeks later, his business partner confessed to being the person who actually embezzled the money and committed suicide, making Beau's gesture futile. He suggests that Beau adopt a new name, since ""Graves"" sounds like ""Grave"", and calls him Beau Geste.Cut to the men out on pass, watching a ""belly dance"" and drinking. Boldini approaches Beau and tries to get him to reveal his ""secret"" -- whether he wrote the letter. Other troopers intervene, making it known they do not trust Boldini. In return, Boldini reveals that he knows secrets about all of them. As they return to the barracks, Boldini gets an idea to get Dagineau off their back about the letter -- choose a scapegoat who is useless, cut his throat, and then tell Dagineau he confessed. The troopers agree and seize Boldini. As they are about to impale him with a bayonet, Dagineau breaks us the fight, and afterwards in Dagineau's quarters, Boldini agrees to be Dagineau's spy and find ""Graves"" weakness. At assembly the next day, Beau volunteers to be whipped for the riot in the barracks the prior evening. Afterwords, De Ruse discusses with Boldini whether his methods are appropriate.In the infirmary Beau's brother, Johnny is tending to the lacerations on his back. Johnny followed his brothers trail and has enlisted too. Johnny gives him a pocket watch that plays music when opened and has the picture of a girl Beau and his business partner both loved.

Dagineau know that they know each other, but Boldini overhears and tells Dagineau that they are brothers.Half of the regiment is ordered to Zinderneuf to relieve the current squad there. In the barracks, Dagineau addresses Johnny for the first time, hitting him in the stomach and calling him soft. The troops head out to Zinderneuf, and make fortifications in the evening.

Everyone but Beau and Johnny rush out to overpower Dagineau, but he has set up a machine gun and mows them down. Johnny and Beau drop from the wall behind his position and Dagineau is knocked down and strung up by his boots.At this moment a tribe attacks the fort. The men untie Dagineau and rally to repel the assault. The leader of the mutiny is sent to man the watch tower. Beau speaks with De Ruse in his quarters, where De Ruse reveals that he wrote the letter because he was jealous of Dagineau and wanted to infect him with fear but it backfired and made him stronger and harder on the men. De Ruse then dies.The Arabs make another assault on the fort and are repelled at great loss of life. After they retreat, another mutineer is ordered up to the tower. At night Beau and Johnny discuss their plans of having a Viking funeral. In the morning, the Arabs assault the fort again with incendiary missiles. They retreat unexpectedly. Only Beau, Johnny and Dagineau are alive. Dagineau explains that they must know reinforcements are close by. He orders Johnny up the tower. A wounded Arab shoots him in the back as he climbs the ladder. Dagineau shoots the Arab with his pistol. Beau carries Johnny's dead body into the burning barracks. He says to Dagineau ""If you touch him I'll kill you"". When Beau comes out from the barracks, Dagineau tells him the reinforcements are outside, and he fired a shot at them to buy some time to talk. He says that all the dead men are hero's and the report has to reflect the honor of the Legion. Beau says that will depend on who tells the story. They fight, and Beau kills Dagineau with the pistol.Flash forward to Beau in the infirmary from the beginning of the film. The commander ask for his report. He says everyone died defending the fort to the last man under the fine command of Sgt. Dagineau. The commander says he expected to hear that, and that Zinderneuf is to be abandoned because the cost of holding it is too high. Troopers depart on horseback through graveyard. Credits roll."

The Defector,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060295/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An American scientist is sent by the CIA to East Germany to retrieve a secret microfilm from a Soviet scientist interested in defecting to the West but the Stasi secret police's surveillance complicates matters. Montgomery Cliff (in his last role) plays James Bower, an American physicist visiting West Germany who's recruited by a shady CIA agent, named Adam, to help them with the defection of a Russian scientist. But an East German secret agent, named Peter Heinzeman, learns of Bower's meeting with Adam and threatens Bower to mind his own business, while Bower learns of a back story to all this involving stolen microfilm that each side wants.—Anonymous Art expert and Physicist James Bower (Montgomery Clift) is approached by CIA agent Bill Adams (Roddy McDowell) and asked to go to East Germany to meet with a Russian Physicist named Grushenko who is willing to provide the West with the complete details of the latest Soviet missile tests on microfilm. The CIA believes this may determine which country gets to the moon first. Bower is on vacation and wants no part of this. Adams tells him that Grushenko demands to give the information to him only. If Bower refuses, he'll have all his research funding cut off. Bower reluctantly agrees to go to East Germany to meet with Grushenko to get the microfilm. On his arrival in Leipzig he is introduced to Public Relations Counselor Peter Heinzmann (Hardy Kruger) who has a great deal of knowledge of Bowers' purpose. Heinzmann makes it clear that he knows Bower is there to meet with Grushenko. He tells Bower that he wants to know where Grushenko is but Bower denies all knowledge of his whereabouts. During a visit to his contact, Dr. Saltzer, tells him that he should keep in touch with one of the nurses only since he had been arrested that day. Bower returns to his hotel and is told he has been moved to a room 234. In this new room Bower suffers an attempt to brainwash him which fails. Russian spy-master Orlovsky arrives and informs Heinzmann that Bowers has been subjected to ""the room"" in order to break him and learn of Grushenko's location. Heinzmann is outraged and insists that due to his affinity with Bower he should be allowed to work with him to find the microfilm. Learning that his visa has been canceled Bower realizes his life is in danger. With the aid of friends he attempts to escape back to the West and succeeds with Heinzmann's help.—Anonymous American Physics Professor Jim Bower is coerced by less than ethical means by CIA Agent Phil Adams, who he thought was a friend, for an unofficial job in East Germany: to retrieve some microfilm containing top secret information from Soviet physicist Dr. Grushenko about the Russian space tests, and smuggle the microfilm back to the west. Grushenko will only provide the information to Bower, a colleague who translated many of his works from Russian into English. Bower, an art history buff, was traveling to Leipzig and Dresden anyway to view an art restoration project underway, making his cover even more legitimate. Adams has no intention of helping Grushenko defect if that is his want as he is more useful to western governments in his current scientific capacity in the Soviet Union providing secret information to the west. As it is an unofficial job, Bower is provided no protection directly from the CIA. Upon his arrival in Leipzig, Bower is made well aware that the Soviet state security service suspects/knows of his mission with regard to Grushenko. Peter Heinzmann, a young scientist in his own right, was recruited by state security to lead the case, Heinzmann believing because his scientific background would help in understanding Bower's every action. Heinzmann not being a ""policeman"" in the trained sense often leads to differences between him and his handler, Orlovsky, whose tactics are more heavy handed. While in Leipzig, Bower begins an open association with Frieda Hoffmann, a colleague of one of his Leipzig contacts. Their association may be purely personally romantic, purely professional or a bit of both, they needing to be flexible with this story for their own protection against the watchful eyes of state security. What Bower and Heinzmann learn about the case may bring them closer together as individuals, and potentially at odds with the people who brought them into their respective job.—Huggo"

They say, all is fair in love and war; however, how far is one willing to go to succeed and to help his family? Would he accept the daring and startling proposal to make a marriage of convenience just for the sake of a political aspiration or would he listen to his heart? Such is the disagreeable dilemma and the heavy burden a single woman has to carry on her shoulders, Jenny Skoutari--the brilliant Greek Literature student, and daughter of Kosmas Skoutaris, the enthusiastic supporter of the local dominant political party. Suddenly, the future of the community rests on Jenny and her arranged marriage with Nikos Madas--her childhood friend and the opposition's leading candidate--nevertheless, can a love by obligation be the prelude to a fervent romance?—Nick Riganas Nikos Mantas (Andreas Barkoulis) returns to Greece from the US having finished his studies there. His rich unkle Miltos Kassandris (Labros Kostadaras) who supported him financially all these years, thinks it's payback time. He is set to have his nephew elected as an MP. The only one that stands in the way is Kosmas Skoutaris (Dionysis Papagiannopoulos) who influences the majority of the people of the island, where Nikos wants to be elected, and supports Nikos' greatest opponent. Just when everyone is disappointed Diana Kassandris (Mary Lalopoulou) comes up with an inspired plan. Nikos should marry Kosmas' daughter Jeni (Jenny Karezi). The only problem is that Nikos is already secretly married to Yvonni Karipi (Mary Sokali), or so he thinks. That problem is also solved when Diana offers another inspired plan. They explain the plan to Yvonni who came to the island together with her mother Klara (Nana Skiada), in order to marry Nikos in a religious ceremony. Only then would their marriage be valid in Greece. Yvonni doesn't know what to say especially since her mother is in Thessaloniki for a few days. They tell her that they don't have any time to spare and she finally agrees to the plan as well. First Miltos Kassandris buys out Kosmas' debts. Then they more or less blackmail Jeni into marrying Nikos. Of course they don't reveal Nikos' secret to her. They simply tell her that he is in love with another woman (Yvonni), who also happens to be an old friend of Jeni's while she was studying in Athens. The deal is that the marriage will last for three months, until the elections, and that it won't be consumated. She agrees to the wedding. A few days later Klara returns to the island and through a misunderstanding she thinks that Yvonni and Nikos got married in a religious ceremony while she was away. After a while she realizes that Nikos married Jeni and is infuriated. Her daughter can't understand what the fuss is all about since she has married Nikos too in a civil ceremony in the US which is valid since Nikos has also US citizenship. Klara explains to her that the judge who married them was nothing but a common criminal who was just released from prison and needed the money. Yvonni asks her why she had to find a criminal and not a real judge. Klara reminds her that no real judge would marry them since Nikos was drunk. Luckily for them Nikos had no idea how drunk he was and believed the whole thing. But soon new problems arise when Nikos (who is now a ""bigamist"") and Jeni start falling in love. Nikos is jealous of a family friend Andreas Dermezis (Dimitris Kalivokas) who can't help admiring Jeni for her beauty and her wit. To add to that he is also an elligible bachelor. Jeni is upset by the fact that Yvonni and her mother are now living under the same roof with them, the huge villa of Miltos and Diana Kassandris, so as to keep an eye on the two of them. This lack of trust hurts her and she provokes Nikos even further when she starts flirting with Andreas and announces to Nikos that she is running out of time and she has to know what she is going to do after their divorce. One evening they all go out to a club to enjoy themselves. Jeni spends the whole evening dancing with Andreas and Nikos is very irritated. Even though his other ""wife"" Yvonni is also present and dances with other men, he barely even notices her. His unkle can't understand why he is so upset, thinking that this is a perfect opportunity to get rid of Jeni easily. Nikos goes up to Jeni and Andreas and interrupts their dance. Jeni and Nikos are now dancing and Nikos tells her that he demands to be respected for as long they are married. Jeni says that she also wants to be respected and Nikos promises not to dance again with Yvonni. Just then Yvonni, who was dancing with someone else all this time, comes and interrupts them stating that Nikos had already promised her this dance. Jeni is annoyed and leaves the dancefloor. She goes to Andreas again and asks him if he is tired. He says that he doesn't want to create conflict between her and Nikos. Jeni replies that this is not true and they start dancing again. Soon after she tells him that she wants to leave and aks him to escort her to her house. He agrees and they leave together. Nikos wants to stop then but Yvonni threatens him that she will start screaming that he is a bigamist if he follows them. Nikos continues to dance with her. After a while he returns to the house, only to find that Jeni still hasn't returned. He goes to Andreas' yacht to look for her. She isn't there either and Andreas asks what is going on between the two of them. Nikos says that everything is OK and leaves. Next he goes to her family house but she isn't there either. Finally he finds her drinking alone in an almost empty bar. Nikos wants to take her back home but they end up drinking together. They return to the house early in the morning and they are both drunk. There they sleep together. Next morning Nikos has no recollection of what hapenned last night. Jeni reminds him of the details. She thinks that everything is all right between the two of them but soon realises that Nikos is upset and he didn't mean anything of what he said last night. Nikos says that he meant what he had said and he does love her but there is also Yvonni. Time goes by and the day of the elections has arrived. In the evening Jeni's father calls at Kassandris' villa, where everyone is gathered, to announce the results and that Nikos is elected. Everybody congratulates him but just then Jeni faints. They call a doctor who examines Jeni and announces to Nikos that he will become a father. Yvonni accuses Jeni of having an affair. Jeni slaps her in the face and when she sees that Nikos is not going to take responsibility of his actions she leaves. Nikos finally admits that it is his child and storms out. Yvonni and her mother are also very angry with all these and they decide to go to a hotel. Jeni goes to her father's house and she explains the situation to her beloved aunt Matina (Eleni Zafiriou). At the same time Jeni's father goes to the house of Kassandris where he finds out the happy news and is very excited. He goes back to his house. Jeni isn't in a position to deal with him and his happiness and pretends that she is asleep. He wants to wake her up but aunt Matina dissuades him from it. He asks her why she is staying there and aunt Matina says that Nikos had to go to Athens and she decided to stay there for the night. Next morning Miltos Kassandris asks the house maid if Nikos is up and she informs him that he didn't come back all night. He tells her that he will go to the hotel where Yvonni and Klara are staying and if anyone needs him they should call there. Meanwhile Jeni's father leaves his house too, while Jeni is still sleeping. Nikos is hiding outside the house and as soon as he sees his father-in-law exiting, he goes in. He starts talking to aunt Matina, explaining the situation to her and Jeni comes in. There he reveals that he is also secretly married to Yvonni. Jeni and her aunt are shocked. Nikos leaves saying that he now has to pay for what he did. Miltos Kassandris goes to Yvonni's room and just as he is ready to knock on the door he listens to them arguing. Yvonni wants to leave the island before everyone understands that she and Nikos are not married and that the judge was a common criminal. But Klara believes that they can get money from Miltos Kassandris for the ""divorce"", since he will definitely want to avoid the scandal. Miltos Kassandris walks into the room and tells them to leave the island immediately or else he will go to the police. They are left speechless. Just as he is ready to the leave the hotel he receives a call from the general of the island's police (Vasos Andronidis) saying that his nephew is there telling him some unbelievable things. Kassandris says that his nephew should wait for him. Things have changed and he has just found out that his nephew fell victim to those women. Nikos is not happy that the general has called his unkle, but he says he didn't really have a choice since Nikos comes from a prominent family. Jeni on the the other hand packs her things and is ready to go to Athens without seeing her father. She tells her aunt to tell him that Nikos had called for her and that as soon as she settles down she will let her know where she is. Miltos Kassandris explains the deceit to his nephew and the general of the police and tells Nikos to go to his wife. Nikos goes to Jeni's house only to find that she has already left. He tells aunt Matina that everything is OK now and runs to catch Jeni. When he arrives to the island's harbour he sees that her ship has already sailed, but still he manages to reach her and explains everything to her. Jeni is overjoyed, they both fell into the sea and start kissing each other."

Intrepid men of great purpose and endurance, searching for the ice bound secrets of the unknown, unearthly, frozen continent. And following them, modern day explorers. Mechanized task forces of scientists and engineers from many nations working together to uncover the secrets of Antarctica: Operation High Jump, the International Geophysical Year, Operation Deep Freeze, and now after more than a year of exploration and research a team of these scientists are leaving Little America. Their destination: the United States. Their cargo: specimens of animal and plant life from the bottom of the world.""A U.S. Navy R4D (a variant of the Douglas DC-3) is flying to Gow Island, in the South Pacific, for fuel. While the co-pilot, Stevens, sleeps, the pilot, Miller, flies. The crew chief, Sandy, brings sandwiches. A sharp bump sends the chief back to check on the cargo. Miller explains to Stevens that the cargo is plant specimens from the Warm Lake area of Antarctica. We see various parts of Gow Island, a U.S. Navy installation. A civilian meteorologist, Bob Spaulding (Edward Faulkner) supervises a sailor, Phillips, filling a balloon, unsuccessfully. Dr. Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) engages Bob in conversation. Bob tells Dr. Beecham that his contract is up and he is anxious to get back to the mainland. His one regret is leaving Nora. Ensign Rutherford Chandler (Bobby Van) feeds his dog, but is unsuccessful in teaching it any tricks. He is hung over from the party the night before. Diane (Kay Elhardt), a Navy Nurse, and Marie (Pamela Mason), a middle-aged civilian scientist tease the Ensign about his behavior the night before. He got so drunk, apparently, he forgot everything. Chandler drives over to the base control tower. The radar operator, CPO Fred Twining (Billy Gray) reports to the tower that he has an aircraft on radar. The pilot of Navy 3255 contacts Gow Island for landing instructions. Chandler checks with Fred before he climbs the stairs to the tower. Chandler gets a briefing, then calls the acting commanding officer, Lt. Charles ""Charlie"" Brown (Anthony Eisley). Chandler informs Brown that the plane from the Antarctic is inbound and will be landing shortly. Brown calls Warrant Officer Holly Hollister (Taggart Casey). He tells Holly that with bad weather approaching, he wants the Navy aircraft to be refueled quickly and sent on its way. Holly tells the Chief Warrant Officer, McBride (Russ Bender) that Brown seems to be getting nervous that they can't do their jobs.Bob has packed and is ready to leave when he spots Nora Hall (Mamie Van Doren). He approaches the nurse and informs her he will be leaving shortly. He asks for a goodbye kiss, but she refuses, ""You can catch up on your kissing at the weather station in Miami. There are plenty of pretty girls to help you forget Gow Island."" He tells Nora he loves her and wants to marry her. Dr. Beecham and Marie stop in the Mess Hall for coffee. Beecham stops by to see Lt. Brown to give him promised reports. Brown asks for a briefing on ""Hot Lakes"". Beecham pulls a chart out and explains, ""About a year and a half ago, helicopter survey teams discovered, right in the heart of the ice pack, three hundred square miles of ground. Heated by underwater lakes and containing a unique type of vegetation that must have been there since before the first ice age.""Stevens briefs Miller on the aircraft status upon his return to the pilot's seat. Miller sends Stevens back to check on the chief. A penguin squawks as Stevens discovers Chief Sandy and calls for help. The scientists aboard run back to assist. The chief has gone crazy and no one is able to restrain the man. His face is burned and he manages to pop open the cargo door and jump out. Miller reports the situation, but his transmission is garbled. He mentions the cargo door and then we hear shots fired. The pilot continues his approach and emergency vehicles are dispatched to the runway. Two sailors get into fire protection suits (Del ""Sonny"" West, and an uncredited Red West). The pilot lands the airplane, but fails to drop his landing gear and slides to a stop. Brown and Chandler enter the aircraft and only find the pilot aboard and he is in a state of shock. Miller is treated in the Infirmary by the base doctor (Phillip Terry), who reports to Brown, ""I'm afraid it will be quite a while before he can tell us anything. He's in a state of shock."" The doctor recommends immediate transfer to the mainland. Bob Spaulding asks Brown about his transport off the island. Brown tells him the airplane is blocking the only runway. Spaulding and Brown dislike each other.McBride and Beecham supervise the unloading of the crippled aircraft. Holly tells Brown they should be able to move and fix the airplane. Dr. Beecham notices a trail of corrosive material on the cabin floor. He takes a sample for analysis. They take the cargo over to the warehouse. At a Navy base on the mainland, an urgent message is received from Gow Island. It is brought to Cmdr. Arthur Simpson (Biff Elliot) who briefs Admiral Knight and other officers on the proposed modifications to the island needed for satellite tracking equipment. Dr. Beecham examines some of the plant specimens in the warehouse. Beecham tells Brown he's concerned about the trees. He proposes to plant them near the hot springs to hold them. Brown orders a 24-hour guard on the airplane. Diane is spooked by Miller in the Infirmary. Nora suggests a cup of coffee. Bob enters to talk to Nora and again tries to get intimate, but again she brushes him off. He is jealous of Brown's interest in the nurse.The guard (Del ""Sonny"" West) on the airplane paces as Diane watches her patient. She goes to the door and when she turns around, Miller is out of bed and attacks her. Nora and Brown talk in his office. He holds her briefly. Nora returns to the Infirmary and finds Diane on the floor and calls Brown. The guard is attacked by the wandering Miller. He manages to knock Miller out with a well-placed punch to the jaw. The doctor tends to Diane, and Nora briefs Brown. McBride rushes in to report something moving in the warehouse. Brown and Chandler enter the warehouse while McBride and Dr. Beecham remain outside. The warehouse is a shambles and they find the same substance they found on the airplane: so corrosive it is eating through the concrete floor. They notice the penguins are missing. The doctor administers a strong sedative to the pilot. Bob waltzes in to the Infirmary and demands, Brown, ""I demand you lock up this maniac before he attacks somebody else!"" He claims Miller is faking, and to prove it he grabs the pilot and shakes him. He is prevented from hitting Miller by Brown, who pulls him back. The two get into a fight, with Bob getting the worst of it. Nora follows Brown into his office and they kiss passionately.Chandler's dog barks then runs into the jungle. Dr. Beecham continues his analysis on the corrosive substance. Marie observes that it acts like an enzyme. Diane finds Chandler out on a walk. She brushes up against the building and gets burned by the corrosive substance. He rushes her into the Mess Hall and washed it off in the sink. The airplane guard hears a strange noise and investigates. He approaches, and the unseen menace attacks him. Later we learn he was killed and his name was West.The next day they take the plant specimens to the hot springs to plant them. Marie tells Brown, ""These plants are most extraordinary. They're a living fossil, based on a structure that is unknown in present vegetation."" Marie wanders off and screams. She has found the badly burned body of a man wearing a blue flannel shirt. In the hospital, the doctor and nurse Nora try to communicate with Miller. The autopsy on the body indicates it was badly damaged by a corrosive substance, and the clothes suggest it was one of the scientists returning from the Antarctic. Bob takes the time to make up some fire bombs. He thinks some creature is responsible and that fire is the answer.A tree bobs around and expels a seed with a root structure. The dog chases the moving seed. Marie hears the dog and goes looking for it. She walks straight into the tree which attacks her. Her screams attract base personnel. Bob grabs a couple of his Molotov cocktails, and heads out towards the screams. Brown orders Spaulding to throw one. Brown heads into the jungle followed by Hollister, but they are unable to find the scientist. Fred reports that something has disturbed the birds in their nesting area. Chandler goes searching for his dog. He hears a strange noise and is ensnared by the tree monster and killed. Brown and Hollister find Chandler's flashlight and rifle. Dr. Beecham finds something on the ground. He picks up the seed and takes it back to the lab. On the way, he notices the lights flickering. McBride reports to Brown that something got into the generator shack and destroyed it.The next day, Dr. Beecham shows Brown the seed he found. It twitches in the jar through a layer of sand. Spaulding and Twining go to the nesting site to investigate. Dr. Beecham speculates that the plant is a new problem. At the nesting site, Spaulding and Twining find many dead birds. That night Spaulding tells Brown that there are at least a dozen things on the island. In the Mess Hall, a man screams. McBride's hand is severely burned by the seed. Spaulding and Twining capture it between two plates, while Nora dresses the wound. When Spaulding goes into the Infirmary to get some blankets for McBride, he is attacked by Miller.Commander Simpson briefs the Admiral. He tells him the suspect in the killings on Gow Island is an animal-like plant that secretes a deadly fluid. Admiral Knight orders a quarantine on Gow Island. He intends to evacuate the personnel. Dr. Beecham speculates that shortly a few hundred creatures could swarm the island, but they will not cross fuel, so he proposes that they build a line of defense.Twining is returning with some shark he caught. He is attacked by one of the tree creatures. It manages to rip the sailors arm off at the shoulder. Twining escapes, but collapses from shock and loss of blood. Spaulding, Brown, and Hollister find him. Miller escapes from the hospital area of the warehouse. He heads for the nesting area. Brown and Dr. Beecham find a large stump of a tree. Miller runs right into it and is killed. He is dissolved and consumed. A well thrown gasoline bomb by Spaulding engulfs the tree in fire. It flops over and burns. Dr. Beecham explains that it walked to where they found it and that is will consume anything, ""even other trees."" He speculates that when light it reacts like any tree, but in the dark it uproots itself and hunts for food. Three more trees appear and firebombs dispatch them. Commander Simpson proposes that napalm be used on the tree creatures on Gow Island. Admiral Knight orders him back to the island to take charge. Once there, Simpson coordinates the attack. Dr. Beecham joins him at the control tower. We close with scenes of napalm ignited fire plumes and the narrator informs us, ""Gow Island, in the past virtually unknown to the rest of the world. Today, a famous landmark in man's struggle with the unknown. Another step forward in the march of science."""

The Louisiana wedding of debutante Phoebe Ann Naylor to Don Andrea de Baldasar, El Duce de la Casala is stopped by the Cavalry over a matter of honor. Don Andrea flees across the river to Texas, where he meets up with Sam Hollis and his Indian sidekick, Kronk, who are carrying rifles to the town of Moccasin Flats. Don Andrea rescues an Indian maiden, Lonetta, tames some longhorns, competes with Sam for Phoebe's affections, eludes a Comanche war party and the cavalry (who have come to Moccasin Flats to celebrate Texas' statehood) and ultimately saves the town and gets his girl.—Robin Richmond 1845. Sam Hollis, who travels with his faithful but wisecracking sidekick, a native Indian he has nicknamed Kronk, has been refused by the US Cavalry any guides for protection of him and his cargo to travel across Texas through dangerous Comanche Indian territory to Moccasin Flats since Texas is not part of the union. In Shreveport, Spaniard Don Andrea Baldasar, whose wedding to southern belle Phoebe Ann Naylor is rudely interrupted and who is more gallant than he is smart to American ways, is being pursued by the Calvary in their mistaken belief that he killed one of their officers, Phoebe Ann's former fiancé, Yancy Cottle. Before Baldasar goes on the run, he and Phoebe Ann agree to reunite in Texas. Hollis and Baldasar, who meet on the Louisiana side of the border river between Louisiana and Texas, join forces for their now mutual goals with regard to Texas, with Hollis nicknaming Baldasar ""Baldy"". Despite their true affection for each other, their partnership is not always a harmonious one due to their basic differences. Their relationship is complicated by they needing to battle both the Cavalry and the Comanches. It is further complicated by the entry into the situation by two women: a Comanche squaw named Lonetta, who does whatever she can to protect Baldy; and Phoebe Ann herself, who Hollis falls in love with before learning her connection to Baldy.—Huggo"

At a boarding school in the pre-war Austro-Hungarian Empire, a pair of students torture one of their fellow classmates, Basini, who has been caught stealing money from one of the two. The two decide that rather than turn Basini in to the school authorities, they will punish him themselves and proceed to torture, degrade, and humiliate the boy, with ever-increasing sadistic delight. As each day passes, the two boys are able to justify harsher treatment than previously given. Torless is a passive member of the group but observes rather than participates and frustrates the tormentors by dryly analyzing their behavior.—Dean Harris <gershom@earthlink.net> Törless is a student at Prince Eugen Boarding School. In addition to being homesick, he, a cerebral young man, doesn't much like it there, feeling he isn't learning what he needs for his life. In that cerebral state, he is usually the observer rather the participant in many of the activities with his friend, Beineberg, such as their joint visits with Bozena, a local prostitute. He learns that one of his fellow students, Basini, has stolen some money from Beineberg to pay off a debt to another student, Reiting, the theft to which Basini eventually admits. While Törless believes the best course of action is to report Basini to the school authorities for them to deal with him as they see fit, Reiting and Beineberg instead decide to deal with Basini in their own way. Beineberg and Törless talk philosophically about what they will do to Basini, treating it as an emotionless academic exercise. Beineberg in addition wants to see just how far he can push Basini before breaking him. But as Törless watches Beineberg and Reiting exact their form of punishment, each time the torture, both physical and emotional, being more sadistic with no end in sight, Törless comes to a conclusion about not only what he thinks of his fellow classmates, but of the school as a whole.—Huggo"

The Devil's Sisters,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058008/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Floridian filmmaker William Grefé's previously lost ""true crime"" roughie THE DEVIL'S SISTERS makes its digital debut (well, most of it) via special features producer Ballyhoo Motion Pictures. When her policeman boyfriend Antonio (Frank Pinero, Grefé's DEATH CURSE OF TARTU) dumps her for spurning his more physical advances, virginal Teresa (Sharon Saxon) decides to go to Tijuana and look for a job. She answers a newspaper ad seeking an attractive young woman to help with ""extensive domestic and social activities"" and soon finds herself locked in a bedroom cell and forced to service the paying customers of hostess Rita Alvarado (Anita Crystal). Teresa seeks solace in alcohol and cigarettes until Antonio turns up as a paying customer, calls her a ""money-hungry whore"" and refuses to help her. Rita's ever-watchful henchman Jose (William Marcos) informs her that the policeman recognized Teresa, so the girl is spirited away to ""The Ranch"" where Rita's sister Carmen (Floridian TV actress Velia Martinez) sells girls to the highest bidder while her cigar-chomping henchwoman Marta (Mildred Rodesky) ""treats"" the girls who have had the misfortune to get pregnant and meats out punishment to those who try to escape. When Teresa and Emilia (Nora Alonzo, Grefé's WILD REBELS) fail to fetch 500 pesos from an ""Englishman"" (Michael DeBeausset, the Florida-shot HONEYMOON OF HORROR) and Emilia is killed trying to escape, Teresa's survival becomes less certain (her own escape attempt is punished with a barbed wire-wrapped nap on ""The Royal Marriage Bed""). Will Teresa escape ""The Ranch"" or will she be digging her own grave next? If it wasn't for the man from England, who knows what may have happened to her. The Englishman had given her a key to a safe deposit box. He had told her the box contained over 10 million in stock bonds- under her name. The Englishman told her she was his daughter.—Joseph Palma"
The War Is Over,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060481/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A middle-aged political activist tries to dissuade his young followers from taking radical action. Diego is one of the chiefs of the spanish Communist Party. He is travelling back to Paris (where he lives) from a mission in Madrid. He is arrested at the border for an identity check but manages to go free thanks to Nadine, the daughter of the man whose passport is used by him. When he arrives in Paris, he starts searching one of his comrades, Juan, to prevent him from going to Madrid where he could be arrested by Franco's police...—Yepok La Guerre est Finie represents one of the few ""linear"" films of French director Alain Resnais although Resnais still uses flashbacks and flashforwards that suggest what is going on in the mind of the chief protagonist. Resnais, however, mainly sticks to a logical progression of events in relating this tale of an underground political operative. It is 1965. Yves Montand plays a tired, aging communist revolutionary whose target is Spain's Franco regime. He goes by at least three different names, Diego, Carlos, and Domingo, suggesting the stealthiness required of a life under ground. The movie opens with Diego and a colleague driving north across the border from Spain to France, and being stopped at a checkpoint, suggesting that he may be becoming a familiar face to the authorities, although he and his colleague are let through. Michel Piccoli plays the border official--Piccoli's career will take off in a few years.The official checks Diego's passport, and calls the phone number listed on it. Fortunately for Diego, Nadine, the daughter of the owner of the passport, answers the phone, and vouches for ""her father."" Diego's photo had been surreptitiously substituted for the father's photo. Diego eventually returns to the suburbs of Paris, his home base, and travels to the apartment of Nadine and her father to arrange to have the passport returned, altered back by an expert forger, with the original photo set in place. The father is away traveling, and does not appear in the film. Nadine, a university student, is played by a young and beautiful Geneviève Bujold. After she observes that Diego (here using the name Domingo) is old enough to be her father, they make love.Later that same evening he returns to the apartment of his paramour, Marianne, played by the beautiful Swedish actress Ingrid Thulin, who is often seen in the films of Ingmar Bergman. Marianne is also the name of the character Thulin played in Bergman's Wild Strawberries, made eight years earlier (the viewer almost has the feeling that she, with her child, who was unwanted by his natural father in that earlier movie, is the same character seen in Wild Strawberries, having divorced her frosty Swedish husband Evald, and moved with her son to Paris). The Marianne in La Guerre Est Finie is a book editor and single mother. She is deeply in love with Diego, and wants to have a child by him. Later that evening Marianne and Diego they make love.Thus Diego/Carlos/Domingo makes love to Nadine and Marianne in the same evening. Quite an accomplishment. But Diego is played by Yves Montand, who in real life betrayed his friend the playwright Arthur Miller by having an affair with Marilyn Monroe during the filming of Let's Make Love. I thought Alain Resnais was thinking about Montand's personal life when he had the Diego character betray Marianne, who makes it clear in the film that she had an opportunity to sleep with another man but let the opportunity pass.Diego is concerned that the Spanish police are on to the operation of the underground. Several members of the underground have been arrested in Madrid. A goal of organizing a strike to take place just before May Day is in jeopardy of failing. Diego warns his colleagues in exile with him in France that the goal is misplaced and that they are overmatched. But the leader argues against him with relentless Marxian mumbo jumbo having little connection to the reality in Madrid. His colleagues believe that Diego is burnt out and needs a rest. The viewer can't help but notice Diego's incessant smoking throughout the film, which adds to the perception of his weariness with his hazardous life lived in the shadows.Toward the end of the film, there is a wonderful scene in a cafe in which Diego is standing at the bar, drinking an expresso. A disheveled man standing at the coffee bar next to Diego asks for a cigarette. Diego removes an entire pack from his pocket, and offers the pack to the man. The man tells Diego that the cafe is inhabited by (undercover) police. Diego asks the man how he knows. The man replies that he works for them. Diego snatches the pack of cigarettes back from the man and reinserts it in his pocket.His colleagues soon reverse themselves, and order Diego to go on a mission to Barcelona. It is perhaps possible that they are sending him off because they want to get rid an agent who has become too war weary to depend on. Diego's cautious and careful observation of the streets around Paris leads him to discover that Nadine is being shadowed by the French police. He soon learns why. She is part of a radical revolutionary group--a group that is independent, and contemptuous, of his--that plans to detonate plastic explosives in Spain; the purpose of the plan is to damage the growing tourist industry that helps support the Franco regime. He visits the radicals in person, trying to warn them off their course of action. The young radicals, however, are too foolish to heed Diego's warning. Diego and a colleague, a new initiate into the underground, drive off to Spain on their assignment from the leaders in Paris. Marianne gets a warning from Nadine that Diego may be heading into a trap. The film ends as Marianne leaves for Spain in order to divert Diego back to Paris before the Spanish police can arrest him. We don't know if she succeeds."

As the lights go down at night in a remote mental asylum, Ivan (Germano Longo as Grant Laramy) is in bed with Katty (Rosella Burgamonti as Patricia Carr), one of the nurses. He begs her to stay longer, but she tells him she must get back to work. Dr. Vance gets furious if she is late, she tells him. He rants about how he hates the place and wants to leave very much. Lighting a lamp, she suggests that maybe he likes it here because he has everything he wants and has made no attempts to find another job. He admits he stays because of her. Suddenly there is a knock at the door and someone calls for Katty. She tells them to go on without her and that she will catch up with her. As Ivan is leaving, he drops a straight razor on the floor. She notices and he picks it up without saying anything. He kisses her and leaves.Sheena (Harriet Medin as Harriet White) is leaving a room. A mans voice from within tells her he will call her when he wakes up. She carries a lamp and goes to the room of an old woman who pets a stuffed cat. She tells the old woman that it is nine oclock and time for lights out. Snuffing out the room lamp, she leaves and checks on another room.Mary (Barbara Wilson) is reading from a book entitled  MARY STUART  to patient Janey (Anna Maria Polani as Ann Sherman) where the title character is about to be beheaded. Sheena interrupts, saying Mary is off-duty and must leave. Mary tells her that she would like to remain and finish reading to Janey. Sheena chides her that this is against the rules and leaves the room. Mary promises to return in the morning to finish reading the story. Janey (who is mute) mumbles and obviously wants Mary to remain. Outside in the hall, Mary is chastised for getting too close to the patient.Mary is shown to a very ornate room where she is told she will stay temporarily until a nurses room is prepared for her. Sheena tells her the previous nurse left the room in a terrible mess. She lights a candelabra, and bids her goodnight.Mary, now dressed in her nurses uniform, extinguishes a lamp and is observed from an upper walkway by a black-hooded figure. The figure goes downstairs and enters the room of Janey. Approaching the sleeping girl, the figure removes the covers and pulls out a straight razor. Janey awakes (unable to scream) and flees out the window for her life as the figure begins slashing. She runs through a field where she stumbles and continues running until she comes to a fountain. As she drinks from the fountain, the figure approaches with the blade and kills her.The hooded figure darts into a doorway of the building as a guard dog barks. Walter (William Gold) attempts to chase the suspect through hallways, including a laundry room where clothing is hung to dry. Down another hallway, Walter hesitates before entering a room he suspects the figure entered. Inside he is questioned by Lizabeth Vance (Mary Young), wife of Dr. Robert Vance (William Berger), head of the clinic. Vance enters and chides him for entering without knocking. Walter apologizes, saying he thought an intruder had come in. He slinks away. Vance asks if Lizabeth would like him to lead her to the bedroom. She refuses, saying she is able to do it herself.The next morning Mary brings a tray in to Janeys room and finds the bed made up freshly. There is no sign of the patient, but Mary finds the book on the floor with a slash mark on the cover. Vance enters and asks if there is a problem. She asks about Janey and is told that relatives came early this morning and took her away. Mary seems puzzled about this. Sheena apologizes to the doctor, claiming she forgot to tell this to Mary. He tells her to introduce Mary to the patients.After skipping one room, Sheena introduces Mary to Mrs. Hurley, who shows Mary the stuffed cat but then turns defensive when Mary reaches for it. Sheena tells the old woman to behave or she will take away the cat.They go to another room where Sheena looks in through a slot in the door. Entering the room, she introduces Mary to Fred (Massimo Righi as Max Dean), whom she warns can be dangerous. Fred speaks to Mary, telling her that he is not allowed any chairs or anything that he might use to hurt someone or himself. She tells him that soon he will be well. He hangs his head in doubt. Suddenly there is the loud sound of footsteps from the ceiling. Fred becomes more panicked, saying the footsteps drive him mad. Finally Sheena has to ring for Ivan to come and subdue Fred until he is calmer. Vance enters and calls for a sedative. Telling Mary that the attacks are getting more frequent, Vance gives Fred an injection. Mary looks at the ceiling, still hearing footsteps. Dr. Vance goes upstairs toward the source of the footsteps. Mary follows and asks if she can help. He tells her to go back downstairs.Mary hesitates but curiosity gets the better of her. She follows until Ivan grabs her, telling her that no one is allowed upstairs. He puts his hand on her as if to molest her, but she leaves.Vance goes down another hall and enters a room where a woman talks to him. He tells her that her footsteps are heard all over the house. She walks with one foot wearing a heavy shoe. She refuses to show her face, but we see that her hand is gnarly and deformed looking. He begs to help cure her in his clinic, but she refuses, saying she will forever be tied to him. He holds up a black-hooded robe, implying that she wears it. She tells him to leave her alone and he does.Outside, it is windy and dark. Through the forest a carriage is riding, carrying a man and a woman. Gisele (Francoise Prevost) complains of the long uncomfortable trip and wants to stop. Marc de Brantome (Phillipe Hersent) at first ignores her, until she begins to suggest a warm bed for them both. He promises this when they reach the coast.All at once the carriage breaks down and Marc examines the wheel and axle. Complaining of the poor condition of the carriage, he tells Gisele to come and help him. She knocks him out, but spooks the horses, which run away with the carriage.Later she arrives at a cavern where she hears chopping sounds. She is able to observe Vance burying the body of Janey. He hears something and grabs a pickaxe, but is unable to hear anything else and goes back to his work.The next morning when Vance is leaving, he finds Gisele sleeping and asks where she came from. She tells him the carriage with the horses bolted, trampling the driver and that she wandered through the forest all night. He tells her he will allow her to stay at his clinic for a few days.Lizabeth sees them arriving from an upper window. As they enter the drawing room, Lizabeth is playing the piano. Vance introduces Gisele and explains that she was involved in an accident where a man was killed by spooked horses. Lizabeth welcomes her to stay. Sheena enters and tells Vance he is needed by a patient. He tells her to prepare a room for Gisele. Sheena suggests the room that was occupied by Janey. He agrees and leaves.Mary shows the room to Gisele, including the bathroom. In conversation Gisele refers to Robert by his first name, which surprises Mary.Lizabeth complains that Gisele should not have been brought there to Vance. She questions where he has been and what he was doing. Incensed, Vance replies that he doesnt have to account for every minute of his day to her. As he pours himself a drink, Lizabeth tells him that he cant continue to seduce women and then- He demands to know what she is going to say. She tells him it was because she loves him that she spoke on his behalf and freed him from imprisonment in the past. She perjured herself and that they should go away together and start a new life.Gisele hears the footsteps from above in her room. Suddenly Sheena knocks and tells her that it is lights out at 9:00 for all patients. Gisele insists that she is a guest and not a patient. She says she was invited by Dr. Vance. The footsteps are heard again by both women. Gisele asks about them, but Sheena replies that she has heard no footsteps.Unable to sleep, Gisele plays cards. She hears footsteps outside her door and goes to investigate. She sees Vance going around a corner. Putting on her robe, she follows him to the top floor, where he enters a room. She opens the door to find another passageway to another wing of the building. Hearing someone coming, Gisele retreats to where she left her candle at the top of the stairs. Someone covered in a sheet blows out the candle and Gisele flees to her room in terror.Fred is seen taking the light globe from the lamp and breaking off part of it. He comes to Giseles room and gets in, threatening her with the broken glass. In one of his maddened states, he pulls off the bedcovers, scattering the cards and glaring menacingly at her. When Gisele goes to open the bathroom door, she finds only a white wall. A struggle begins on the bed between Fred and Gisele. Mary comes in and calls to Fred, appealing to his right mind. As she talks him into surrendering the glass globe to her, this is observed by Sheena, Ivan and Dr. Vance who enter the room. Finally with the glass in her hand, she calms Fred down and Ivan takes him away. Dr. Vance thanks Mary for her help. Then, hearing Gisele moan, he goes to her and notices cuts on her arm. He calls for Mary to get bandages. He tells Gisele that it will not happen again.Ivan takes Fred and puts him in an isolated cell. Mary comes in and wants to know who ordered putting him in this cell. Ivan tells her it was Dr. Vance. She speaks kindly to Fred, telling him that it will not be for long.Dr. Vance and Sheena are working in the laboratory, where he is trying skin grafts on animals. He is seen applying a paste to a guinea pig.Gisele throws a scrap to the guard dog who accepts it. Ivan comes out and expresses surprise that she gets along so well with animals. She asks him who is housed on the top floor. He says he does not know. She puts her hands on him as if to encourage his help. This is seen by Mary and Katty, who are returning with supplies. Mary tells Ivan that the doctor wants to see him.Dr. Vance and Sheena complete their work. He is hoping they will be successful. Ivan knocks and asks if he was summoned by the doctor. Sheena tells him that he must have been mistaken. He leaves.Gisele hears the footsteps above her room again. Putting on her robe, she goes out and listens to an argument between Vance and Lizabeth. She observes them from an upstairs passageway, and then goes to the room where Vance went before. Knocking and getting no response, she enters and sees Laura, sister of Lizabeth (Delfi Mauro as Delphine Maurin) facing the wall. The woman turns around and Gisele is horrified to see her disfigured face. Laura tells her to go. Gisele faints and Laura bends over her, touching her face. Rising, Laura begins moaning and shuts her door. Gisele is left in the hallway unconscious.Sheena is seen trying to revive Gisele in her bed. Dr. Vance comes over just as she awakens and chastises Gisele for betraying his hospitality by spying. She tells him that the authorities might be very interested in what she would have to tell them. He tells Sheena to leave the room. Gisele threatens to tell what she knows, including that he buried the dead girl Janey. She wants a large sum of money, which he tells her will take some time to get. She threatens him further and he leaves. As he walks away from her room, we see Sheena, who apparently was listening in.Upstairs, Laura emerges from her room wearing the black-hooded robe. Meanwhile, Lizabeth goes through the laundry room and down a corridor. This is observed by the old woman holding the cat. Suddenly a scream is heard as the old woman sees something. Lizabeth is found on the floor. Gisele runs out and finds Lizabeth, who is also seen by Sheena, Ivan and Walter. Ivan and Walter carry Lizabeths body away. Sheena picks up a razor and suggests something to Gisele, who will not be frightened or blackmailed.Dr. Vance attends to Lizabeth in her bed. Someone suggests that maybe Fred is involved, but it is said that he was safely locked in his cell.Someone wearing black gloves is seen getting the key to Freds cell and unlocking it. Pulling it open slightly, a straight razor is placed on the cell bars to incriminate a sleeping Fred.The next morning Mary goes to bring a tray to Gisele and discovers that she is dead and bloody. She interrupts Dr. Vance who is trying to get Lizabeth to drink. She calls him aside and tells him about Gisele. They go to her room and he covers her with a sheet. Mary tells Vance that the authorities will have to be called. He says no. She reminds him that a woman has been brutally murdered. He tells Mary that no one knew Gisele came here. He picked her up in the forest.They go into his office, where he locks the door behind them. He begins explaining about his life and then we see in a flashback of when Laura arrived after Robert and Lizabeth had married. She and Robert spent much time together and they obviously like each other. Several happy scenes are observed with Robert and Laura enjoying each others company while Lizabeth looks on. Then he tells about building the new clinic and how they went to see it during construction. Walking along high scaffolding, he shows something to Laura as Lizabeth watches from a few feet away. Suddenly a rope gives way and Laura plunges into a pit of lime acid. He confesses that it is Laura who hides herself upstairs and that he is the only one she will see. Although he was tried for her accident, Lizabeth testified on his behalf. He was freed, but unable to practice as a doctor anymore. He resigned himself to working only at his clinic. For this reason he tells Mary that he cannot be associated with another death.There is a frantic knock at the door. Vance opens it and Ivan informs him that Fred is missing from his cell and that a razor was found.Lizabeth hears voices speaking loudly and rises to put on her robe. Mary enters and cautions her to remain in her room. She offers to stay with her, but is told Mary might be needed elsewhere. As she opens the door to leave, a bloody arm falls down from above, dropping a razor to the floor. Mary screams and Vance puts his hand on her mouth. He explains that Fred, who is seen above, killed himself in remorse for killing Gisele and that the authorities will be told this.That night the staff is eating together. Ivan comes in late and touches Katty on the neck. He sits and ladles soup into his bowl. Mary makes excuses and leaves the table. She goes to a room but it is empty. Sheena comes in, takes the lamp and tells her to leave.Passing Vances room, Mary notices the lamp is still burning. She goes to extinguish it, not noticing that he is seated there before the fire. He speaks to her, telling her of the anguish he has endured these last few days and years. He tells Mary that his wife no longer loves him since Laura was in between them. He moves to kiss Mary, suggesting that she help him.Lizabeth, seeing them kissing, shouts  Robert!  and runs away. He follows. Running through the halls, he calls for his wife. Sheena comes out and he tells her to look for Lizabeth.In the laboratory, Mary selects a large knife from several instruments. Suddenly Sheena comes in with a lamp, asking what Mary is doing in there. Mary makes an excuse. Seeing the guinea pig, Sheena exclaims that the transplant has been successful and that Dr. Vance needs to be told.Laura comes out of her room wearing the black-hooded robe and ambles down the hallway. Meanwhile a search is being made outside by all the staff for Mrs. Vance. Sheena comes out to tell him of the discovery. He says he will attend to it after his wife is found.In her bed, Mary hears footsteps outside her door. She sees the shadow of feet go past her door and back again. She lies back down. The door opens quietly and the black-hooded figure enters with a razor. Approaching the bed, the figure begins slashing at the covers. Feathers fly as it is revealed to be pillows only. Mary comes out from behind the curtains with her knife and confronts the figure, who turns out to be Lizabeth. At the same time we see Laura, who confronts Lizabeth about the accident. Laura says it was Lizabeth who released the rope that caused her to fall (we see in a flashback). Lizabeth denies this but stabs Laura, who falls. Lizabeth flees the room. Vance comes in and sees Laura on the floor. Mary tells him it was Lizabeth. He runs after her. Lizabeth goes up to the top floor, screaming madly. Vance goes downstairs and outside where others are still searching. Lizabeth comes to an open window and is seen by Vance and the others. He cries out for her not to jump, but she does. Crowding around her, Vance cradles her as she confesses to doing all she did for love. As she dies, he announces that the nightmare is over.The next morning Vance is seen leaving. As the carriage passes Mary, it stops. Vance helps her into the carriage and they leave together. She realizes that Vance was not the murderer."

As they go through the woods and have a picnic, they are suddenly surrounded by a bunch of suspicious strangers. A small group of adult bourgeois friends are on a day out in the country, which includes having a picnic. While taking a walk after the picnic, they encounter a group of officious looking men who order them to go to a small clearing. Although there is no direct threat and the picnickers are not scared, they nonetheless feel the need to do what the men say. The men, led by one called Rudolph, set the rules of ""the game"". Ultimately, the picnickers learn that Rudolph was supposed to invite them to a party nearby. Much like the game, the party's host sets the rules for the party to which the picnickers and all the other guests must abide. Order in the eyes of the host seems to be paramount. Although the picnickers and the other guests enjoy many aspects of the party, some just do not want to be there, but such thinking cannot be tolerated.—Huggo Distinguished by being ""banned forever"" in its native Czech Republic, Jan Nemec's ""A Report on the Party"" is a great film from the flowering of the Czech cinema in the 1960s. It is a political thriller that satirizes unquestionable conformity. A group of happy picnickers on their way to a birthday banquet are accosted by a group of strangers led by a bullying sadist who has an unbreakable hold over his followers. The master finally discovers them and puts an end to the charade, inviting everyone to a nonsensical, but elegant and formal banquet outdoors. Nemec documents the process of self-deception and rationalization which lead to an acceptance of constraint; free will and freedom are seen as difficult to maintain and easily discarded. The affair is bizarre, and ends when one of the guests (played by film director Evald Schorm) chooses not to remain and escapes. His compatriots agree that he must be recaptured, and the group arms and hunts him down. The film concludes with the nightmarish barking of search dogs.—Fiona Kelleghan <fkelleghan@aol.com>"

Boniface takes the opportunity to confess to Marcelle that he is attracted to her, in the hopes that she feels the same about him, and that she would be amenable to having an affair while their respective spouses are away. She is on both counts. M. Boniface believes the place they should go is the Hotel Paradiso, which has been slyly advertising without the authorities' knowledge that it is not averse to renting rooms ""by the hour"". The hotel is operated by Anniello, who, with the assistance of his naive busboy George, has ulterior motives for operating this type of establishment. Beyond being able truly to think about the nature of what they are about to do, M. Boniface and Marcelle find that they may have problems embarking on their affair because of who they learn is also at the hotel: stormy weather-induced stuttering M. Martin, a barrister friend of the Bonifaces, and his four adolescent daughters; Victoire and Maxime, the Bonifaces' maid and M. Cot's nephew respectively, the two who want to partake in a little hanky-panky of their own, and M. Cot, this the hotel which is the one he is supposed to inspect. Beyond not wanting to be seen by those that know them, M. Boniface and Marcelle try to leave the hotel, which is easier said than done. Even if they are able to make it out of the hotel, M. Boniface and Marcelle may still have some issues when they make it home based on what may have been seen at the hotel. Through it all, a mysterious man with a professional problem observes the proceedings, the goings-on which may be able to assist in he overcoming his issue.—Huggo"

Strange goings on at the site of an experimental underwater laboratory as a mysterious object of unknown origin is detected in the area. A group of researchers investigate and come face to face with the object, a large automated extraterrestrial probe.

Skipper arranges for Wayne to go down to Sealab, an underwater research facility anchored to the bottom.Arriving at the installation he is greeted by Dr James (John Howard) who is in charge of the medical facilities. Dr Rene Peron (Sheree North) who is a marine biologist, then finally Dr LasSatier (Gary Merrill) he is tracking an unknown object about a mile and a half from the installation. Listening to the sonar, Wayne decides there is no known propulsion moving the object. He also dismisses the possibility it is a whale.LaSatier then introduces Wayne to Dr Wilson (Biff Elliot) who is the teams electronics expert. Wilson explains the object is making noise in the ultra sonic level, well beyond human hearing. Renee then reports the object is now in range of the mini sub piloted by Hugh Maddox (Mike Road). Maddox who is the teams best diver has some history with Wayne, who seems concerned he is involved with the mission. Maddox reports the object is huge and probably a submarine. Before they can get closer the unknown vessel moves off.Sandra Wells (Wende Wagner) is co pilot of the sub. She is critical of Maddox impatient actions; if they had taken extra air tanks they might have tracked the object longer. Lasatier then alerts Maddox to the presence of Wayne on board. He seems equally disgusted the navy has sent him of all men.The photos taken by Maddox reveal little detail. Wayne wants to arrange a combat unit to patrol the area. He is concerned the craft is some new development by the Russians, and he needs to learn as much as possible about itA report comes through from the control room the object has reappeared and headed towards the installation on an attack course, Commander Wayne thinks there is no threat, the unknown vessel has had plenty of opportunity to attack in the past and didnt The unknown vessel does a very close pass of the installation but causes no harm. It then drops out of sight in one of the deep trenches that surround the area. The installation seems to be intact, however the radio lines connecting the station to the surface has been cut.Unseen back at Sealab, the now stationary vessel deploys a small probe into the main entry chamber of the craft. It is encased in ice and the size and shape of a small scuba air tankWayne decides it is time to go and investigate the craft. Maddox is selected to accompany Wayne on the mission. This creates tension between the two men. Maddox remembers a situation where he believes Wayne left some trapped men to drown in a submarine accident. Wayne counters with the observation Maddox was one of the men, and he survivedThe two men head out in company with Sandra Wells who will be photographing everything they encounter
After swimming around the vessel once, they find an access hatch and enter. It is a large featureless chamber. The party finds the container previously placed there by an automatic process. They are unsure what its purpose and decide to take it back to Sealab for further study.Making measurements of the retrieved probe they detect a signal being transmitted at similar frequency to those detected on the main ship. Some of the party wants to cut the probe open and see what is inside. Wayne vetos the plan, he is concerned what might be inside and wants to wait for the Navy to issue instructionsPeron goes back to studying the object and believes it is larger, as if it is growing or expanding. Re-measuring the item they find it is 2 inches longer. They try to determine what is feeding the device. Dr LaSatier thinks it might be absorbing heat.A high pitched squeal begins to echo through the lab. Rene screams as she sees the object is doubled in size. Dr Wilson remains behind in the lab to secure some fragile equipment. The sound increases in intensity and Dr James grabs his head causing him to drop a canister of acid he was movingDr Wilson escapes the lab but collapses, the others realize the crisis and cut the ventilation system to stop the spread of acidic vapor. Cmd Wayne and Tex (William Thourlby) enter the lab to get things under control, they see the probe has broken open, but before they can understand what this means a humanoid creature attacks them.

Maddox reacts badly and blames Wayne for leaving Tex behind. He wants to reenter the lab but cant because the creature has broken out flooding the chamberOn the surface they realize the lines have been cut to Sealab.

As they enter the diving chamber the creature surfaces and attacks.Wayne escapes but Mike (Glen Sipes) is wounded. The creature goes back into the water then sabotages a gate at the bottom of Sealab to stop any of the humans escaping. Regrouping in the control room they remaining crew weigh their options.Dr LaSatier suggests they may hold out for the supply ship arriving the next day. Wayne thinks they cant last that long. Wayne suggests closing off further compartments to try and extend the air supply. He tells James to move Wilson and the other injured men to the control room. LaSatier informs him that Wilson has just diedWayne checks on the condition of Tex, LaSatier shows him that Texs condition is worsening. Wayne is puzzled; he did not think the injuries were that bad, Dr James thinks that an unknown infection has set in. They wonder the creature may know it is infected and escaping his home planet. James prepares a vaccine and inject Wayne. He is really not sure if it will do any goodWayne decides to set a trap for the creature using the spear guns on the lab. He asks Maddox to help, who asks are you looking for more sacrifices. Wayne has had enough and decides to have it out about the circumstances of the sub years before. Wayne wants to know how Maddox got out but the others drowned. He challenges Maddox that it was him who actually killed the men. There was an escape pod they all could have used, yet Maddox was the only one who didMaddox counters that yes he did get to the chamber first, but the others would not follow, they were still at the hatch Wayne closed. Maddox said he had always had nightmare about the faces of the drowning sailors. Wayne argues he could not know that unless they were trying to get into the chamber and not through the hatch. Wayne then wants to know why two of the drowned sailors were still hanging onto the escape chamber mechanism when the sunken wreck was brought to the surfaceMaddox cracks and admits he froze when he made it to the chamber and yes he was the person who killed those men. It was the reason for leaving the service, he hated the thought he was a coward and could not look the surviving sailors in the face.Two hours later the men have rigged up all the available spear guns with trip wires. They want to lure the creature into the station and try and kill him with the spears. After a number of false starts the creature takes the bait and hit by a number of spears. It appears not to be killed but definitely woundedWayne and Ellis (Richard Niles) go into the water after the creature. Maddox watches indecisively then seems to reach a decision and go down to aid Wayne. After playing cat and mouse amid the corals, the creature finally sees a chance and attacks Wayne, the other two men join in the battle but the creature is obviously extremely powerfulAfter a lengthy fight the creature, wounded and exhausted is captured and taken back on Sealab. Wilson pumps the creature full of sedatives to knock the creature out. Wayne and Maddox then go to the surface vessel to restart the pumps and report in to the Navy about what is going on.Wayne finds all the radio equipment destroyed. Maddox get the pumps working but the diving bell and winches have been destroyed. Wayne thinks there are more of the creatures back on the original ship. He organizes all the dynamite they can find and heads of to destroy the alien craftBefore they get there a second creature is deployed by the alien ship. Dr Lasatier opposes the plan. He want every saved so the scientific community can study all the technology.Onboard Sealab the creature revives and attacks Rene and Dr Wilson, then sets out after the men heading for its ship. Arriving the team begin assembling the bomb until the creature arrives and interrupts their work
Maddox corners the creature and distracts it long enough for the other to escape.The creature stops its attack long enough to disarm the bomb, but Maddox uses a distress flare to ignite the explosives destroying the creature the ship and Maddox.Chapman_glen@yahoo.com"

He therefore puts on the disguise of a doctor and starts investigating in a somewhat uncomfortable town. Near the end of the American Civil War, an entire unit of one hundred Union sharpshooters vanish into thin air in a rugged, mountainous region. To shed light on their mysterious disappearance, Sugar Colt, a former special agent, superb marksman, and director of a shooting academy, rides into the dusty town of Snake Valley, posing as Doctor Tom Cooper. But, newcomers, especially the brazen ones, are rarely treated with respect in the God-forsaken hamlet. Now, Tom will have to put his skills to good use, as guns have the final say. Will Sugar Colt get to the bottom of what happened to the missing U.S. Cavalry officers?—Nick Riganas Tom Cooper (Hunt Powers a.k.a Jack Betts) is the owner and main teacher of the Academy for the Spiritual Freedom of Women, and his real name is Rocco. In there, some women (Patrizia Giammei, Mara Krupp and Elisabetta Velinska) learn how to shoot and they practice on pictures of their annoying relatives: husbands, aunts... Cooper lives comfortably, and secuces some of the most attractive women who go to the academy.One day, an old friend of his from his Army times asks him to take care of some business: a friend of his has been asked ransom for a son whom everybody had left for dead for years. That son and his batallion disappeared on their way to Gran Alamo, and the friend of the father thinks that the batallion must have lost his way to Snake Valley, a small sun-burnt town in the village of nowhere where you arrive leaving the main road to the left. At the beginning, Cooper is not interested, but that night his old friend is shot to dead by Alan Pinkerton (George Rigaud) outside the Pinkerton detective agency. He was close enough to hear his last words: ""think of the father"".So Tom Cooper makes believe he's a meek doctor with a fake degree certificate. He doesn't defend himself when two rascals, Black (Paolo Magalotti) and Pink demand a 25cent toll of him for going to Snake Valley. They hit him but the Colonel appears to defend him. Cooper is given his money back and arrives to his destination: everybody on the street seems to stare at him.He checks in in the saloon of the town. Mrs Bess (Jenny Oak a.k.a. Gina Rovere) allows him to check in. Cooper allows himself to be beaten again; however, later on, he wins everybody on a fight ""because of the scientific art of fighting"". That night, he tries to watch around what's going on. He enters a room and Josefa (Soledad Miranda), the saloon waitress, a young girl who is Mrs Bess' niece, watches him. He pretends to be trying to make out with her. Bess overhears the noise and comes up to see what's happening. From that moment on, Josefa seems to dislike the doctor deeply. In the conversation with Mrs Bess, Cooper hints at his interest on Mrs Bess herself, to which she seems incredulous.The next morning, Clayton (Jeff Cameron), White and other people call on the doctor. However, the sheriff Bingo (Luis Barboo) accompanies the doctor, saying that he won't have any customers anyway. The gravedigger (Víctor Israel) tells him that Clayton has just died, and White tells the doctor that he's OK, that he had been summoned because of his wife but that she's already well.Coming back to the saloon, Mrs Bess tells the doctor that he won't make any money on Snake Valley. The doctor recommends Josefa to take a pill against the smoke, but she doesn't really swallow it: she just spits it. Immediately afterwards, Cooper puts something on the saloon fire, so that all the room gets smoky and foggy. Josefa gets dizzy like everybody else because she spit the pill. Mrs Bess - who seems unaffected by the smoke - punches Josefa and carries her upstairs. All the rest of the patrons look drugged out of their minds.A military cornet resounds. One of the saloon patrons (Osiridi Pevarello) gets into a frantic and says that he didn't want to do it, and the major kills him. The kidnapped batallion gets all excited, -imprisoned underground- thinking that, finally, the army is coming to rescue them. The colonel of the town (Giuliano Raffaelli) asks for Peter Headway (Ricardo Pizzuti), telling him that his father hasn't got any money to pay the ransom because of his gambling habit, and Peter is asked whether he has got any other relative who could pay 50,000 dollars. Peter knows that nobody he knows has such an incredible amount of money, so he is shot to death.Cooper shoots two gunners who tried to shoot him in the night. He gets threatened once again. However, at that moment, in the middle of the saloon, he takes off his glasses, his coat and his bow hat, and instead of leaving, he tells to everybody that gunman Sugar Colt has arrived, and to prove his worth, he shoots several of the gunmen present at the saloon. Agonía (Manuel Muñiz), one of the gunmen present, is made to wake up and confess having told Cooper aka Sugar Colt that something was happening in the town. He denies it, but he is hanged anyway.The colonel knows that Sugar Colt must have been helped by the person who played the trumpet.

The major tries to buy Sugar Colt, but he doesn't look eager to compromise, although he also avoids creating a scene on the burial place. The major asks him whether he believes that the trumpet is played by the ghost. Of course, Cooper doesn't say it's really Sammy (Fortunato Arena), his assisstant, who is looking for an abandoned mine, or a derelict building, or a place where a group of people may be hidden from view. Sugar Colt finds Sammy's corpse - he had heard the two long wailing notes which were their keyword, but could not assist him at that particular moment as he was talking with the colonel. Josefa had insulted him because he was leaving, but now Sugar Colt has a personal reason to keep on the case again.Cooper is trapped and left alive but carried tied on a horse. He unties himself down and kills some of the bad guys and runs away. He is hurt but alive, and returns to the salloon on the verge of collapse. Josefa and Bess tend to him and his wounds.The colonel hits Bess and he tells her that it was him who gave her the saloon. However, the colonel takes Josefa with him to force Bess not to help Sugar Colt anymore, who had run away from the saloon.Sugar Colt kills one of the sentinels by pushing him down a well after stealing his Mexican sombrero. He disguises himself with that and takes one basket of bread with some other bread porters to the prisoners. There, he frees them. He leaves them but tells them to wait inside. However, the privates will not wait, and their leader, Preston (Nazzareno Zamperla) goes with them. They try to leave but some are killed with a shotgun.

Carter basically controls the entire nearby town with help of hired thugs, and he is determined to kill Hillmann and take Kay as his lover. Finding Donato's dead body, Hillmans first though is to blindly rush off and kill Carter, whom he knows to be responsible for the crime. However, Nebraska urges Hillmann caution because Carter will be waiting for him. Nebraska suggests that they wait and plan things out. Hillmann agrees and both he and Nebraska ride into town to report the incident to Burt, the local sheriff who has been disgraced by his alcoholism. Using the fact that Carter's men have stolen Donato's horse as evidence, Burt puts the two men who killed Donato in jail, all the while knowing that he is endangering his own life by opposing Carter.Later that night, as they ride home to the ranch together, Hillmann and Nebraska become good friends as they talk about their lives and how Nebraska ended up as a drifter. Hillmann is impressed by Nebraskas intelligence and resourcefulness, and promises to be loyal to him. At that moment, Hillmann is shot by an unseen assailant. The assailant is none other that Bill Carter himself. But the need to get his wounded friend back to the ranch prevents Nebraska from going after the culprit.The next morning, Carter's men are set free when another one of Carters men arrives at the jail with bail money for them. When Burt uncovers some evidence against them, he is shot and killed. Meanwhile, Nebraska leaves the ranch to look for Burt, unaware that the sheriff has been killed. Taking advantage of Nebraska's absence, Carter and his men show up at the Hillmann ranch. By this point, Hillmann has already died from his wounds, and Carter is anxious to retrieve the money thats owed to him. In transpires that Kay and her father had conspired with Carter to rob a bank in El Paso. However, Kay and Hillmann double crossed Carter by running off with the money. Pretending to be married, the criminal couple have been hiding out in New Mexico, and now that their hiding place has been discovered, and with Hillmann out of the way, Carter is ready to reclaim the only two things that interest him: the money and Kay. The money is quickly discovered partly buried on the property, but before the bandits can escape with it, they are thwarted by the sudden appearance of Nebraska. In the climatic gunfight, all the thugs are quickly dispatched, and the subsequence fight between Nebraska and Carter ends with the former being killed.Nebraska hands the stolen money to the new sheriff, who seems only too happy to keep the money for himself. Shaking his head, Nebraska mounts his horse and rides off, alone once again, leaving behind Kay who is alive and well, but facing a lonely, sterile future."

She quickly rises to the top of the gang, and sets her sights on the leader of the local neighborhood tough guys. A no-good Manhattan girl moves in on a Brooklyn gang. Using her obvious charms she gets the leader killed in a fight over her and then takes up with the victor and new head man. Then she starts pushing him to get out onto the streets to mix it with rival gangs.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The Rebels, a Brooklyn, New York, gang ruled over by Johnny ('JOHN BATIS' (qv)) and his girl, Angel ('LINDA GALE' (qv)), are going along on their merry, antisocial street violence. A young man offers ten bucks to streetwalker Rosie ('JONET BANZET' (qv)), and she refuses, calling him, ""Creep!"" Later he breaks into her bedroom with three pals, and they gang rape her (off screen). (6:10m, during the opening titles)Terri Fiore ('DIANE CONTI' (qv)), an attractive brunette, buys her beer in a bar, and lets Nino ('JOEY NAUDIC' (qv)) talk with her. She's the deb of Frankie, leader of Manhattan's Golden Falcons gang. Now he is in jail and shes alone. Annie ('SANDRA KANE' (qv)), a tall, bosomy blonde, with slim hips, is Nino's deb, and she does not appreciate his interest in the new girl around; eventually, she leaves.There is a dance at the Brooklyn Rebels seedy sea-port club headquarters. Terri Fiore's old Parents ('GENE MARRIN' (qv) and 'LIN KENNEDY' (qv)) make a scene, reproaching the girl for leaving after dinner, but she leaves anyway.Angel, Johnny's blonde deb, makes a great entry in a luscious fur coat, that she takes off to reveal a chequered V-neck short jacket, leaving ten inches of her belly naked over the tight bluejeans.
When Terri turns up at the gang's clubhouse on Johnny's arm, with her hair caught in a white band, she is wearing a light-coloured coat, under which she wears a low-cut black top that leaves her arms and shoulders bare but for two tiny straps, and the black latex trousers zipped on the back (as seen later in the fight); Johnny is wearing a dark sweater.
Angel approaches them, and demands Johnny to send the new girl away: ""I'm still your deb, and I've got the scars to prove it.""
""Used to be, used to be!"" interrupts Johnny. ""Now beat it!"" ""Don't tell me you're leaving me for this piggy face...""
""Yeah!"" cuts Johnny, as he strangles Angel's throat with his right hand, his long fingers clawing her hard.
The handsome Johnny likes the competition he sees between the two girls; if he subdues his gal, may be he can have both debs. Angel is not having nothing of that, and she stares him eye-to-eye. Nino and the other teenagers stop him, and demand him to let the girls fight a duel over him.
""OK by you?"" Johnny asks from Terri.
""OK by me,"" she agrees. Angel flies into her rival, resulting in an exciting, jazz-scored catfight. The fight consists of slapping, hair-pulling, and shoving, mostly rolling around and kneeing each others body while on the floor, or shoving and pushing in frenzy while on their knees, at close range, holding each other by the arms or shoulders. First the blonde seems to have the advantage, and sits for a minute on top of the slightly older teen, than, with an evil green on her face, the black haired girl reverses positions, and starts punishing the blondes face. Yet, positions will be reversed time and again, but the blonde seems to be tiring, and now almost only trying to defend herself, and her shirt, that her opponent tries to rip off which she finally achieves. At the same time, the brunette applies a powerful downward punch between the breasts. Angel loses her top, but retains her bra, showing the letters KJ tattooed on her breast, as she had mentioned. (The breasts remain covered with a white bra.) After almost a 3 minutes battle, the brunette ends up sitting astride the debs bosom, slapping the other girl to tears.
Angel is hugging herself, both from modesty and pain. Forgive me, Johnny, sobs the beaten blonde. Then, Angel stands up from the floor, badly beaten, but still defiant; she spits on his face. He slaps her, not harder than Terry had done before; however, this marks the change of their love affair, and Angel does cry her heart out, as she is kicked out of the club. Forget it, lets bit it out of here fast! Johnny says to Terry.
Johnny and Terry then retreat to the ""Trophy Room"", with mementos captured from rival gangs, including a pair of crotchless panties. There, they consummate their partnership after smoking a reefer.Three Golden Falcons attack one Alien boy in a long, violent, and deadly street-rumble, with no dialogue and bass-heavy music, and presenting the RPM with their WWII helmets, as The Aliens. [The Rat Pack Motorbike club, from Queens]Meanwhile, Terry is postponing her ritual tattooing as much as she can. Angered by Johnny's determination to ""initial"" her chest with a knife, Terry puts the moves on the second-in-command Nino ('JOEY NAUDIC' (qv)). She asks to see the weapons room, which he does - scissors, daggers, clubs, metal chains She approaches him. He embraces her, they kiss, and make love while the others dance. Again, the KJ tattooed with a knife on her breast is exposed. After their lovemaking, Angel bluntly asks Nino to kick Johnny out of the gang, promising to be his deb. This leads to another lovemaking scene. When they go out, Nino has taken enough incentive to confront Johnny. Johnny defies him to a duel outside, and all are assuming it would be a fist fight. But Angel gives Nino a knife, and Johnny immediately pulls out his own flick-blade. There's a 2 minute switch-blade fight, and Johnny dies.Angel comes forward, but Annie objects to her take-over. Angel shouts that the other blonde is the one who caused it all, and suggests, ""Line her up for the guys!""
The boys rape her there and then, but she keeps her bra and skirt on.In a back-alley, two boys attack another blonde girl, the deb of the Eagles leader, but she is saved by Terry. More mindless violence and deaths follow. After four Eagle boys are killed, the police arrest the wrong guys.
To commemorate their war victory, Nino's gang has a Saturday night bash. The music is jazz-rock and 'Lee Dowell' (qv) sings Black Belt, a karate dance number, during which boys and girls mix in a karate choreography.Terry is now giving orders, pushing Nino into more gang wars, and when they argue, she is the one who is in control. Piggie ('TOM ANDRISANO' (qv)) and his girlfriend Ellie ('EILEEN SCOTT' (qv)) want to leave the gang and get married. Terry accuses them of being police stoolies, forcing Nino into a second knife duel with Piggie, knowing that Piggie is not a good fighter, while Ellie is forced to watch. Nino kills Piggie and Ellie cries her heart out. Again, Terry gives Nino his reward - herself - right after he cleanses his blade on Piggies shirt.But Piggie's murder finally drives the gang debs into taking action. Four female Rebels invite Terry to a girls-only party. When she arrives, the three girls she has expelled from the club in such a painful manner - Annie, Angel, Ellie - appear, and judge her faults We decided to stop you! Terry shouts, Keep away from me! but the seven get revenge at last, attacking the bad girl with heavy leather belts, clubs and knives. The beating is off-camera, presumably to her death or disfigurement, as one of the girls says, ""No man will ever look at her again...""The soundtrack plays ""Dont make me angry, boy. / Dont make me mad!"""

Liberated from a slave auction, Osami joins with priest Ensai on a quest to find and deliver relics of the Buddha to Osami's brother in the Middle East for transport to Japan. They join with a camel caravan crossing the vast western desert, then are captured by a tyrant king. The king, who has lost his belief in the goodness of man, allows Osami the chance to complete the delivery of the relics to his brother on the promise that Osami return within three days to suffer burning at the stake. If Osami does not return in time, the innocent Ensai will die in his stead.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> A monk journeys down the Silk Road to find the relics of Buddha, where he meets a sword-wielding Japanese student. While on their way to deliver the relics to a Japanese diplomat, the two travels with a camel caravan into the town of Pesil, where they stumble upon a conspiracy to overthrow the King in nearby Kigan Castle.—Oliver Chu Ensai, a traveling monk, buys a Japanese man, Osumi, who is being sold as a slave at a market. He tries to set Osumi free, but the freedman is interested in what Ensai is doing. Ensai tells him he plans to collect Buddha's relics and bring them to Kotan. He also plans to erect a new temple in Japan with the relics. Ensai crosses the desert with a caravan, and Osumi tags along, helping the monk when he collapses in the desert. Due to a misunderstanding, Ensai thinks Osumi is ""Really"", because to every statement the monk makes during the journey the freedman only says ""Really?"". The caravan is attacked by bandits, and Osumi and Ensai take refuge in the side of a mountain, which happens to be the place where some of Buddha's relics were kept. In the morning they collect the relics, but find everyone else has left. While continuing to cross the desert, they see two women running by, one more richly dressed than the other. They come to a pond where they meet an old wizard. The wizard asks if they have seen two women go by and Ensai says yes.
Osumi and Ensai reach the town of Pesil, but all of the residents are scared of them. A small group of people are willing to accommodate them. A procession of guards marches down the street. Osumi stays outside to watch and sees the two women from before in a cage. The more richly dressed one discreetly drops Osumi a pink piece of fabric. He learns that the woman who dropped him this piece of fabric is the queen, and that the king is suspicious of everyone. What nobody knows, however, is that the leader of the bandits who attacked the caravan earlier is living in the castle, and the Chamberlain plans to overthrow the king and make his daughter Spuria the queen. Suddenly the group is ambushed, and everyone except Osumi is arrested. Osumi goes to a pond, and is joined by another man. Osumi thinks the pond look suspicious. The man recognizes it as the Hell Pond. The two are accosted by a witch, who announces herself as the guardian of the pond, and reveals the man to be the Captain of the Guards. She attacks the Captain, who has climbed up a tree, but is stopped by the wizard. The wizard tells Osumi and the Captain that the Hell Pond is irrigated to the moat of Kigan Castle. Osumi sneaks into the castle, and presses the queen for questions on where his friends are being kept. The queen urges Osumi to run away, but Osumi is determined to confront the king. A chase ensues, and Osumi breaks into the king's chamber, using Spuria as a human shield. He asks the king why he mistrusts his own people, but the king sentences Osumi to burn at the stake the next day. The king's advisors, who are working with the Chamberlain and the bandit leader, are also allied with the witch. They worry about Osumi exposing their traitorous plot. The witch decides to destroy Osumi in the Hell Pond. Disguised as the queen, she sneaks into the dungeon under the cover of night. She sees Osumi sitting in his cell, shackled in chains and sleeping tight. She tries waking him up, but nothing she says or does is able to rouse him from his slumber. She then hears the voice of the wizard, and reveals her true form. She suspects that the wizard put Osumi under a sleeping spell. The wizard flatters the witch by telling her how she looks in her queen disguise and asks her to change into it once again. She starts to do so, but the wizard disappears and a guard comes. The witch, stuck in an awkward position, also vanishes.
The next morning, Osumi is taken to be executed, and Ensai pleads to speak to the king with him. Spuria takes them to the Chamberlain. Ensai asks the Chamberlain to allow Osumi three days to deliver the relics to Kotan, and offers himself to take his place. The Chamberlain allows for this.
Osumi travels the desert to Xi'an and gives the relics to his brother. On his way back to Pesil, he is attacked by bandits and is thrown into Hell Valley. The witch traps him down there with a wall of flames. Osumi survives. The wizard looks after him overnight.
Later in the morning, a dehydrated and exhausted Osumi makes his way back across the desert. He doesn't make it to the stake in time but Ensai hasn't been executed yet. Slowly but surely he makes his way to the stake and cuts Ensai's bonds, allowing himself to be bound instead. The king is awed by Osumi's selflessness and sets him free.
The Chamberlain takes control of the castle by force and has the guards attack the town. The bandit leader kills him and takes control. A battle ensues. Osumi fights the bandit leader on the portcullis and causes him to be impaled by his own spear. The witch tries to burn the castle with the moat, but two servants raise the drawbridge. With her foot still on the pedal she learns too late that the wizard replaced the burning water with regular water. She falls into the moat and evaporates.
The next day, the king wants to reward Osumi and Ensai, but they continue to travel along the silk road."

"Jimmy, the Boy Wonder",1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060559/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A boy makes a reckless wish, and everybody in the world stops moving. A wizard's daughter tries to help him get the world restarted again. Tired of the drudgery of his daily routine, young Jimmy shouts out, ""I wish time would stop!"" Somehow, his wish gets heard by the master clock, and everyone (except Jimmy) is frozen in their tracks. Observing this catastrophe is a magical astronomer, who sends his daughter Aurora to talk Jimmy into helping her undo the damage before the evil Mr. Fig siezes the opportunity to take over the world. As Jimmy and Aurora travel to the end of the world to replace the Golden Globe in the master clock, they pass through strange new places, all the while with Mr. Fig trying to stop them on their mission.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> A voice-over narrator explains that once every thousand years, the so-called 'Great Clock of Time' pauses to let in the sun's rays in it's domain when it is most vulnerable and when a simple spoken wish could stop it's timing.After the opening credits, we are introduced to Jimmy Jaye (Dennis Jones) an eight-in-a-half year old boy in his bedroom waking up and hearing his mother remind him that it's time to get up and go to the very first day of school. As his mother keeps reminding him to keep up with time, Jimmy talks to himself saying ""time to do this, time to do that.... I wish time would just stop!"" Suddenly his wish is granted and the Great Clock stops ticking. All over the neighborhood (and the world as well), everyone gets frozen in their tracks.Observing all of this from a mystical realm, an elderly Astronomer (Karl Stoeber) calls upon his daughter Aurora (Nancy Jo Berg) where a large globe-like lantern trinket (about the size of a basketball) materializes before the Astronomer who tells Aurora to go to the little boy who made the wish to stop time and for him to put it back in the Great Clock at World's End so time can start again. After Aurora teleports away, the Astronomer is visited by a fiendish looking wizard known as Mr. Fig (David Blight Jr.) who realizes through the Astronomer's nervous ramblings that Aurora intends to put the globe back in the Great Clock. Mr. Fig teleports away.Aurora materializes before Jimmy in his bedroom where she tells him about the wish he made and that he must correct things so that time can start again. Since Jimmy made the wish, only he can replace the globe in the Great Clock. After using the golden globe to teleport to the alternate Oz-like land, Aurora explains the journey to Jimmy in song ('One Step at a Time').After walking into a field, Aurora tells Jimmy that she must leave him temporarily as they are passing through the land of Mr. Fig the ""time killer"" who is determined to prevent him from reaching World's End. After Aurora teleports away, Mr. Fig appears and first not recognizing Jimmy, introduces himself in song ('Mr. Fig'). Afterwords, Mr. Fig figures that Jimmy is the one that made the wish that stopped time and tries to intimidate him not to continue with his travels. Jimmy is not fazed and after Mr. Fig departs from the scene, Aurora re-materializes so she and Jimmy can continue their journey.Aurora tells Jimmy that they need to find the tribe of the Nakawakana Indians who can direct them to the trail that leads to World's End. While walking along a small paved road, Aurora and Jimmy arrive at a fork in the road and follow a road sign that points to the Nakawkana Indian village, unaware that Mr. Fig had switched signs for the path leading to 'Slow Motion Land'. After seeing that they are not in the right area as Aurora and Jimmy arrive in a playground area where everyone is moving in slow motion, they retrace their steps out of Slow Motion Land with a little help from three little girls.Deciding to rest for a while, Aurora produces two inflatable mattresses so she and Jimmy can rest, but Mr. Fig tries to turn the red-tinted land into blue-tinted land for night to make them fall asleep. It almost works until Aurora uses the golden globe to reverse the effect and it has Mr. Fig going to sleep, and leading Aurora and Jimmy to leave the scene.Aurora and Jimmy arrive in a clearing where they find a group of young men with green skin whom are the Nakawakana Indians frozen in place as a result of Jimmy's time stopping wish. After Aurora un-freezes them in using the golden globe's power, they proceed with their ""rain dance"". The Indian Medicine Man (Alan Rock) approaches and berates Jimmy for interrupting their rain dance since they have been trying to make it rain for several days since their crops are wilting due to the summer-long drought. Aurora offers to help them in exchange for telling them the path to World's End by using the golden globe to make it rain. However the ""rain"" that falls turns out to be beans.... jelly beans! In song, Aurora tells the green-skinned Indians that they are the most favorite beans to eat ('Beans'). The Medicine Man tells Aurora that he feels outmatched by her own power and teleports away to return to his winter home... in Miami Beach! In thanking them for a bowl of jelly beans, the Indians point out to Jimmy and Aurora the trail that leads to World's End.A little later, while resting on a stone rock, Jimmy tells Aurora that he thinks about quitting their journey, but Aurora tells Jimmy, via a the spinning golden globe about another young boy who stopped time....In a long 19-minue animated sequence, a young boy named George, who lived many years ago on a large island somewhere in Europe, made a wish about time stopping and the globe made time stop due to a wicked witch's curse. A friend of George then took him on a magical journey to a make-believe land to meet the so called 'Captain of the Cats' to help defeat the wicked witch. After the journey and magical battle, the witch was defeated, the golden globe was placed back in the Great Clock and time started again.Back in the present world, Jimmy decides to continue his journey, and Aurora reminds him in song about his responsibilities to starting time in their journey ('Think Big'). Aurora and Jimmy come across a parked car with a trailer hooked up to it and decide to get to World's End faster by driving, but Mr. Fig magically transforms the car with the towed trailer into a Volkswagon vehicle when Aurora and Jimmy enter. Then transforms the Volkswagon into a tantrum bicycle before making it disappear entirely. Aurora and Jimmy have to continue their journey on foot.A little later, Mr. Fig materializes once again before Aurora and Jimmy and offers Jimmy a bribe to give up his journey to World's End by offering him a serving tray of his favorite foods which include hot dogs, soda pop, peanuts and popcorn. Aurora tells Jimmy not to be temped by Mr. Fig and Jimmy and Aurora walk past him. Next they come across a talking tree that offers Jimmy a hot dog (the tree is Mr. Fig in disguise). Aurora encourages Jimmy to keep walking.Next, Aurora and Jimmy walk through a nature trail through a ""monkey jungle"". Jimmy sees a chimpanzee watching them from a nearby palm tree, but the chimp is Mr. Fig in disguise. After making it through the monkey jungle, Aurora and Jimmy arrive at a garden-like clearing as the final leg of their journey to World's End begins. Ahead of them, Mr. Fig produces a jug of what is called 'Laughing Syrup' and pours it into a nearby spring pond and hides in the nearby bushes. Aurora and Jimmy, walking through the garden, come upon the pond and decide to take a drink of water due to the hot weather. As expected, they both begin exhibiting uncontrolled laughter. Mr. Fig jumps out of the bushes from his hiding place and attempts to snatch the golden globe away only to fall into the pond itself, and he is affected by the laughing syrup and begins to laugh hysterically while Aurora and Jimmy make their escape.After walking through a fog-shrouded clearing, Aurora and Jimmy arrive at a large stone wall which is finally their destination of World's End. Aurora uses the golden globe to make an opening in the wall where they walk through it and into a maze-like coral stone castle that is supposed to be World's End. Aurora points out to Jimmy a small stone tower a short distance away and tells him that since he made the wish to stop time, only he can replace the golden globe back in the Great Clock. Aurora tells Jimmy to hurry for if Mr. Fig steals the golden globe there, he might stop time forever. After Aurora materializes away, Mr. Fig materializes and chases Jimmy all around the coral stone castle trying to catch him to seize the globe. Jimmy manages climb the steps to the tower with Mr. Fig not far behind him and replaces the globe back in the Great Clock as it's swinging pendulum and the clock re-starts. Mr. Fig screams in defeat and fades away. Aurora re-materializes before Jimmy and congratulates him for ""saving time"". With time starting back again, Aurora teleports Jimmy with her back to his home.Jimmy wakes up back in his bed, from where the film begin... wondering if everything he remembers was just a dream. He once again hears his mother's voice in reminding him that it's time to get up to go to his first day of school. As Jimmy is getting dressed, he can't find his other sneaker and wishes that he could just find it... and then the other sneaker materializes before him.Jimmy runs off to his elementary school and goes to his first class. In the classroom, Jimmy appears astonished that his teacher to his first class is the dead-splitting image of Aurora. The teacher tells him that he has arrived ""ahead of time"" and asks his name and age. Jimmy sees the golden globe on Aurora-turned-Teacher's desk where she remarks that Jimmy seems to recognize the globe as ""old friends"". Jimmy happily replies that they and the golden globe sure are.The End"

Blue Demon vs. the Satanic Power,1966,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058980/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The film begins early in the century with our villain, apparently some sort of sorcerer or alchemist. His ""satanic power"" manifests itself rather arbitrarily throughout the movie in various ways. He is imprisoned and sentenced to death but places himself in a deathlike trance prior to his execution and is buried. Fifty years later a pair of grave diggers unearth his coffin and are understandably surprised when he pops up and kills them. The villain sets up shop in a cobwebby old house and begins his reign. He goes out to, hypnotize a young woman, bring her back to the house, then shut her in a room where she is incinerated by flames (off-screen). Enter Blue Demon. He gets involved when his ring assistant is killed by the sorcerer. The police investigate but find no clues. In the first of a seemingly endless number of puzzling sequences, Blue Demon decides to check things out for himself. Although the police have already investigated the crime scene in broad daylight and removed the body, Blue Demon goes back at night and looks around with a flashlight. He discovers absolutely nothing, and leaves. The sorcerer visits a sixties version of a Mexican Goth club, where kids rock out in a dingy bar decorated with corpses and skeletons. A young lady with an enormous bee-hive hairdo enthusiastically lip-syncs to a catchy, Lesley Gore-type pop song before being hypnotized, abducted, and incinerated. Blue Demon, meanwhile, has come across a mysterious old book which provides him with information about the sorcerer. He spends much time reading book. next thing, Blue Demon has his trusty flashlight and he is entering a spooky cave which contains a secret passage to the sorcerer's house. Blue Demon opens the secret passage in the cave wall, what we see inside is a tangle of what appear to be pine boughs. He pushes through them and disappears from view. The very next shot is inside the house, where Blue Demon enters via a secret door in the fireplace. Blue Demon pokes around the house and finds some of the kidnapped women's clothes. This seems to be significant to him.
Blue Demon is shown relaxing around his apartment.
The sorcerer has somehow figured out that Blue Demon is after him and now stands outside the apartment. Sorcerer hypnotizes the Wrestler and makes him jump from the top of a high wall. Blue Demon's athletic skills allow him to land unharmed, and the hypnotic spell is broken. The sorcerer flees. Finally, Blue Demon leads the police to the sorcerer's house, Blue Demon finds the sorcerer, and they battle."

Though a suicide letter is found, Dr Saravana informs that Gopanathan was infact poisoned from the milk he drank before he went out of the room to investigate. Though the butler is suspected at first, it is found that the milk had been placed near the room window and hence anyone could have added the poison.Jan 16. All the guests request Dr Saravana again to allow them to leave the island. Dr Saravana convinces them that they will get part of Dayanandham's money if they are willing to stay a little longer.

Dayanandham refuses stating that he is determined to find the murderer.Jan 25. At night, while asleep in her room, Raagini hears shouts from her father, Jambulingam that someone is taking him away. She runs into the corrider to find someone pushing the wheelchair of her father. Looking from behind, she is certain that it is the doctor. As she comes closer, the murderer brandishes a knife. Jambulingam asks her to go and get help. When she goes away, the murderer pushes the wheelchair from the top of the stairs. As everyone arrives, Jambulingam is on the floor below but still alive. As they care for Jambulingam, Raagini blames the doctor. Dayanandham refuses to believe that his good friend is the murderer. Even Jambulingam agrees that it might not be the doctor who tried to kill him. Dr Saravana arrives and is unaware of anything that happened. Jambulingam believes that someone is trying to frame the doctor as the murderer. Ponni silently watches this from upstairs. Everyone goes back to their rooms and Raagini takes her father upstairs in the wheelchair. She leaves him alone to get food for him. Meanwhile Ponni is seen walking through the corridor. She goes to the balcony and starts admiring the lake. Someone comes up from behind and pushes her from the balcony.Dayanandham is devastated by his wife's demise. Everyone mourn her death.

All remaining relatives are angry and shocked.Jan 26. All the guests discuss the situation. Jambulingam acknowledges that after thinking about the incident the day before, the person who pushed him from the stairs could have been Dr Saravana. He suggests that the doctor may have wanted to eliminate all of Dayanandham's relatives before his death. This way, if Dayanandham leaves his money to the doctor, then there will be no one else to claim it. The doctor secretly listens to this conversation.Raagini goes to Dayanandham's chamber and asks him to distribute all his wealth equally among his remaining relatives but he refuses. Dayanandham requests Raagini to sing the song which was the favorite of Ponni. While Raagini plays the song in the piano, we see the murderer with the knife climbing down to stairs to kill Raagini. As he comes up behind her, she notices his shadow and turns back. She recognizes the masked person as Dr. Saravana. Before he can strike her, Dayanandham shoots the serial killer from upstairs with his pistol. All of them arrive on hearing the gun shot. Though Dayanandham is surprised that it is his doctor-friend, he is satisfied that they have caught the murderer.While everyone starts discussing the situation and the murderer is writhing in pain, Dr Saravana (played by director S.Balachander) comes out of his room upstairs wondering what all the commotion is about. Everyone is shocked on seeing him. They all run to the murderer and remove his mask. It is revealed to be Jambulingam.Before dying, Jambulingam reveals that he is neither blind nor lame. He admits that he killed the all the people because he wanted to get more of Dayanandham's wealth for himself. He faked his fall from the stairs to mislead everyone about the murderers identity. When Dr Saravana asks why he tried to kill his own daughter, Raagini reveals that she is not his daughter. She is infact a nurse in the hospital whether Jambulingam was admitted. She was also tricked by Jambulingam about his disability. She agreed to come to the island to take care of him. She also reveals that Jambulingam had lied to her that if she didn't come as his daughter, then he wouldn't be accepted by Dayanandham. She apologizes to Dr Saravana for suspecting him.Jan 27. Dayanandham is on his death bed. As per the request of Raagini, he distributes all his wealth among the remaining people in the mansion and dies."
