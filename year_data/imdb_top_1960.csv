Phoenix office worker Marion Crane is fed up with the way life has treated her. She has to meet her lover Sam in lunch breaks, and they cannot get married because Sam has to give most of his money away in alimony. One Friday, Marion is trusted to bank forty thousand dollars by her employer. Seeing the opportunity to take the money and start a new life, Marion leaves town and heads towards Sam's California store. Tired after the long drive and caught in a storm, she gets off the main highway and pulls into the Bates Motel. The motel is managed by a quiet young man called Norman who seems to be dominated by his mother.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> Stressed and under pressure because of stealing a large amount of money from her employer and running away, a partly poor office worker who's committed theft in order to be able to marry the man she loves, gets lost and decides to stay at a motel for the night, regretting what she's done. But on her single night at the motel, she finds out it was a mistake to choose this motel, as she finds its young depressed manager's mother an unrelenting psycho.—J. S. Golden Phoenix-based Marion Crane, who has for ten years worked as an assistant to real estate agent George Lowery, laments the fact she and her divorced boyfriend, Sam Loomis, can't get married due to money issues, he a penniless hardware store clerk whose debt is a result of having to pay alimony. Marion senses an opportunity when one of Lowery's wealthy clients pays his account with forty thousand dollars cash, Marion is tasked with taking the money to the bank. Being a Friday afternoon, Marion believes she can slip out of town immediately undetected with the money to join Sam in Fairvale, California where he lives, before Lowery would even suspect that she has absconded with the money the earliest by Monday. Despite several close calls, Marion is able to make it to fifteen miles short of Fairvale at the Bates Motel, where she stops on the rainy Saturday night. The isolated motel has had little business ever since the state highway was moved. The motel is run by friendly, but lonely Norman Bates, who lives with with his invalid mother in the big, old house on the hill overlooking the motel. Although she doesn't meet Mrs. Bates, Marion knows that she is an angry, controlling woman based on an argument she overhears between her and Norman. Norman admits that his mother is mentally mad. That evening, Marion has a change of heart and contemplates returning to Phoenix to return the money. But she never makes it either to Phoenix or Fairvale. As such, several people come looking for her, including Sam, who is suspected of being in cahoots with Marion in stealing the money, Marion's worried sister Lila Crane, who is able to convince Lowery not to press charges if Marion returns the money, and a private investigator named Arbogast who was hired by Lowery. At various times, they all make their way to the mysterious Bates Motel, where Mrs. Bates will do whatever required to maintain control of what happens at the motel and within her family.—Huggo For Marion Crane, it's been quite an eventful day. The day before, she had stolen forty thousand dollars from her employer's client, packed her bags and driven all day on her way to join her paramour several hundred miles away. Now, she is taking a relaxing hot shower after her long day's journey. The remoteness of the motel suit her purposes perfectly. The only sounds heard are the chirping of the crickets, the splashing of the water, and her humming contentedly as the hot needles of water caress her aching shoulders.—filmfactsman In a Phoenix hotel room on a Friday afternoon, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her out-of-town lover Sam Loomis (John Gavin) end a stolen lunchtime interlude with yet another disagreement about their future. Marion wants to marry Sam, but debts inherited from his father and his own alimony payments do not leave him enough money to support her as he would like. As they have done so often before on Sam's business trips to Phoenix, they part leaving their future uncertain.Marion returns to the real estate office where she works as a secretary, arriving just ahead of her boss Mr. Lowery (Vaughn Taylor) and his client Cassidy (Frank Albertson) who buys a house from Lowery with $40,000 in cash. Lowery tells Marion to put the money in the safe deposit box at the bank until Monday. Pleading a headache, Marion asks to take the rest of the day off after her errand to the bank.But Marion doesn't go to the bank. On the spur of the moment, she decides to keep the money, packs a suitcase, and starts driving out of town, only to be spotted by her boss at an intersection where he gives her a suspicious look. Worried that she has been found out already, she still proceeds out of town on her way to Fairvale, California, where Sam lives. All the while she keeps looking behind her, fearful that she's being followed. She drives well into the night and parks alongside the road to sleep.In the morning, a highway patrolman (Mort Mills) stops to investigate her stopped car, and awakens her. Startled and nervous, she arouses the patrolman's suspicions. He looks at her license and registration, taking note of the plate number. He allows her to go on, but follows her for a while, which intensifies Marion's agitation.Realizing that her car can easily give her away, Marion decides to trade it in for a different car. She stops in at a used car lot, hurriedly pays the salesman (John Anderson) $700 cash for a likely substitute, and completes the deal as the same highway patrolman watches from across the street. Nervous, she drives away and continues toward Fairvale.As night falls on this second day, with her fears of pursuit crowding in around her, she drives into a rainstorm. Unable to see the road clearly, she spots the lighted sign of the Bates Motel, and decides to take a room for the night. As there are no other cars there, and no one in the motel office, she honks her horn upon seeing a light on in the house behind the motel, and a silhouette in the window. Someone dashes down the path to greet her, and he introduces himself as Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). He is soft-spoken and shy young man who tells Marion that he lives in the large house with his mother. He comments that the motel seldom has guests anymore since the new interstate bypassed the local highway, and Marion realizes that she probably took a wrong turn in the storm. Still nervous about being tracked by the police, Marion registers under a false name, and Norman checks her into Cabin 1 just next to the office. When she asks about food, Marion learns that Fairvale is only fifteen miles away.Norman offers to share his supper with her so she doesn't have to go out again in the rain, and he goes back to the house. She begins unpacking, taking time to wrap the money inside a newspaper which she sets aside on the bed table. Then she overhears a shouted argument between Norman and his mother coming from the house. Mother Bates seems to have a low opinion of young women, and doesn't want Norman associating with them. Norman returns to the motel with sandwiches and milk and invites Marion to join him in the parlor just behind the check-in desk.Marion is taken aback by the stuffed birds that fill the parlor, a product of his taxidermy hobby. In their conversation over sandwiches, Norman talks about being trapped. Just as Marion presently feels trapped by her recent hasty decision, Norman is more permanently trapped in his co-existence with his mother and her madness. But as Norman observes, ""we all go a little mad sometimes."" Taking Norman's situation as a cautionary tale, Marion decides to return to Phoenix to make amends, and try to pull herself out of the trap she's gotten herself into before it's too late.When Marion goes back to her room, Norman takes down a picture from the wall and looks through a peephole where he can watch Marion changing. With a new burst of intensity, Norman hurries up the hill and goes into the house.In her room, Marion sits in her robe and calculates some figures, working out how she can repay the $700 she has already spent. Then she tears up the paper containing the figures and flushes the pieces down the toilet. With newfound peace of mind, she slips out of her robe and slippers, and steps into the tub to enjoy a cleansing shower.Unseen behind her, the bathroom door opens. A figure approaches and pulls back the shower curtain. It is the shadowy figure of an old woman wielding a large kitchen knife. Marion screams. The blade lifts high into the air, and then strikes, and strikes again and again. Marion cannot escape the slicing blows of the knife. The savage attack continues, and then her killer leaves. Marion sinks down, reaching for the shower curtain which rips under her weight, and she falls over the edge of the tub. The shower continues to run over her as her blood flows down the tub drain, her lifeless eyes fixed in a final hopeless stare.From the house, Norman's voice yells out in shock, ""Mother! Oh, God! Mother! Blood! Blood!"" He comes running down the hill and into Marion's cabin to find the aftermath of Mother's knife attack. He quickly cleans up the murder scene. He wraps Marion's body in the shower curtain and places her in the trunk of her car, and gathers her belongings into the trunk as well. At the last moment he spots the newspaper on the bed table and tosses it into the trunk, not knowing that it contains the stolen money. He drives to a swamp near the motel, where he pushes the car in and watches it slowly disappear into the dark bog.One week later, Sam Loomis is sitting in the back office of his hardware store in Fairvale, writing a note to Marion. He has changed his mind, and if it's not too late he wants to marry her right away even if his finances are limited right now. Marion's sister, Lila Crane (Vera Miles), comes into the store and asks if Marion is there. Sam tells her she isn't. A private investigator named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) also enters the store and asks for Marion's whereabouts. His interest is in recovering the stolen $40,000, which Lila knew about, but Sam did not. Arbogast is convinced that Marion is somewhere in this town close to her boyfriend, so he sets out on a search of hotels and boarding houses around Fairvale to track her down.When Arbogast gets to the Bates Motel, Norman tells him he hasn't seen Marion, and that there haven't been any guests in weeks. But Arbogast manages to look at the register and sees the false signature in Marion's handwriting. Caught in his lie that here hadn't been any recent guests, Norman admits to remembering her now, and says she stayed that Saturday night and left early on Sunday morning. Arbogast spots Mother's silhouette sitting at the window of the house and asks to see her, but Norman refuses, saying that his mother is an invalid and shouldn't be disturbed. When Norman lets slip his Mother's impressions of Marion, Arbogast becomes determined to talk to her, but Norman insists that he leave.Arbogast phones Sam and Lila to tell them that Marion had registered the previous Saturday night at the Bates Motel in Cabin 1, and that he means to sneak back and talk to Mrs. Bates regardless of Norman's objections. When he gets back to the motel, Arbogast looks into the office and the parlor briefly to see if Norman is there, and spots the motel safe which is standing open. Then he heads up to the house and goes inside. Sensing that no one is downstairs, he starts up the stairs. As he nears the top of the landing, Mother Bates emerges from the bedroom and stabs him. He stumbles backwards down the stairs and falls to the floor, where he is set upon and stabbed yet again.At the hardware store, Lila and Sam have been waiting for Arbogast, who was supposed to return hours ago. Sam tells Lila to stay behind while he goes out to the motel. When he gets there, he calls out but no one answers. Norman, standing by the swamp after having just disposed of the investigator's remains, hears Sam call out for Arbogast.Sam returns to the store, having seen no one at the motel or the house. No Arbogast, no Bates, ""only a sick old lady unable or unwilling to answer the door."" Sam suggests they go see Sheriff Chambers (John McIntire) to report the missing Arbogast. At the sheriff's house, Chambers and his wife (Lurene Tuttle) listen to Sam and Lila tell their story. At their urging, Chambers phones the motel and talks to Norman, who says that the detective had been there but had left. When Lila presses Chambers about the mother, Chambers tells them that Norman's mother has been dead and buried for the past ten years, having poisoned her lover and herself in the only murder-suicide in Fairvale's living memory. But Sam and Lila insist that there is an old woman out there, and that Arbogast had told them that Norman wouldn't let Arbogast see his mother because she was too ill. That makes the sheriff wonder, if Norman's mother is up there at the motel, then who is buried in that grave in Green Lawn Cemetery?Back at the motel, Norman is worried about all the people who have been snooping around. After the phone call from Sheriff Chambers, Norman goes up to his house and voices his concerns which leads to another unseen argument with Mother in which he tells her she should hide in the fruit cellar for a few days. She refuses. Norman says he will pick her up and carry her downstairs. She berates him, but in spite of Mother's protests to be put down, Norman carries his mother down the stairs.The next morning, Sunday morning, Lila and Sam meet Sheriff and Mrs. Chambers coming out of church. The sheriff has already been to the motel before church services. He didn't see anything strange and suggests that the detective probably just moved on to pursue a lead without telling them. He offers to help Lila report a missing person and a theft, and let the law find her sister. Unsatisfied, Lila and Sam decide to go out to the motel for themselves. Their plan is to register as husband and wife and check into a cabin. Then they will search the place more thoroughly.Norman assigns them to Cabin 10, and Sam insists on signing the register. As he pays and asks Norman for a receipt, Lila takes the key and goes ahead toward their cabin. On the way she checks that the door to Cabin 1 is unlocked. After a brief stop in cabin 10 to talk matters over, and after they are sure Norman is not nearby, Sam and Lila enter Cabin 1 to search for clues. Sam notices that the shower curtain is missing and Lila finds a scrap of paper with something subtracted from $40,000, suggesting that Norman possibly knew about the money. Lila wants to talk to the woman in the house because she might have told Arbogast something. She wants Sam to distract Norman while she goes to the house. Sam tries to dissuade her, but she insists she can handle a sick old woman.Sam finds Norman in the office and engages him in conversation, while Lila circles around behind the motel to the house. She enters and looks through all the rooms upstairs. She goes into Mother's bedroom, filled with furnishings and clothes from the Victorian era but strangely preserved as if new. The outline of a woman's body is deeply impressed into the old mattress. She looks into Norman's bedroom, another room frozen in time containing the toys and small bed of a child.Meanwhile, Sam has been trying to get Norman to talk about money, looking for some indication that Norman has the stolen cash. Norman begins to grow agitated. When Sam mentions Norman's mother, Norman realizes that his other guest may be snooping around at the house. Sam tries to keep Norman from leaving, and they struggle. Norman knocks Sam over the head, and Sam falls dazed to the floor.Lila is just coming down the stairs when she sees Norman running toward the front door. She ducks around behind the stairs and partway down the cellar steps to avoid him. Norman heads upstairs. Lila starts to come back up, when she notices the cellar door at the bottom of the steps. This is a room she hasn't examined yet, and she risks the opportunity to look into it.Walking through a storage room and into the barren fruit cellar beyond it, she sees an old woman sitting in a chair facing the far wall. She whispers, ""Mrs. Bates."" But the woman doesn't respond. She taps the woman on the shoulder. The chair swivels around to reveal the desiccated remains of an old woman's corpse, her face contorted into a near-skeletal grin and seemingly staring out of eyeless sockets.Lila screams and turns away, and her flinching reaction sets the bare hanging light bulb to swinging. At that moment, the living semblance of an old woman enters at the door wielding a large knife, blocking the only escape route from the cellar. In the next moment, Sam's timely arrival saves Lila, as he subdues the would-be assailant from behind. The ""woman's"" wig falls away to reveal Norman Bates dressed in the guise of his mother.That evening, Lila, Sam, and Sheriff Chambers are among a bewildered group of interested persons who sit in an office in the County Court House, waiting to hear from a psychiatrist who has been called in to examine Norman. The psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) enters to tell them he has gotten the whole story, but not from ""Norman."" He got it from Norman's ""Mother."" As a personality, ""Norman"" no longer exists. The other half, the ""Mother"" half of Norman's mind has completely taken over.The psychiatrist goes on to explain that after the death of Norman's father, Norman came to depend on the undivided attention of his mother. But when she took a lover, Norman felt as if he had been replaced. His jealousy could not stand to share her. So he poisoned both his mother and her lover. Consumed with guilt over his crime, he stole his mother's corpse and treated it to preserve it as best he could.To further the illusion that his mother was still alive, he began to divide his mind with his mother-- to think and speak for her. He walked around wearing her clothes and a woman's wig. At times he could be both personalities and carry on both sides of conversations. Other times, the ""Mother"" half, the dominant half, took over completely. ""He was never all 'Norman,' but he was often only 'Mother.'""Norman's ""Mother"" personality was pathologically jealous of Norman. When Norman met Marion, he felt a strong attraction to her. That attraction set off the jealous ""Mother,"" and it was ""Mother"" who killed Marion-- and most likely, other women before her.In a locked and guarded room, the physical shell of Norman Bates sits unmoving as ""Mother""'s voice dominates his mind. She wants to prove to the world how harmless she is by sitting completely still. A fly crawls on Norman's hand and he doesn't swat at it, simply smirks as the voice of Mother's personality gloats that everyone must see that she wouldn't even harm a fly.In a final image, a tow chain begins pulling Marion's car out of the bog.END OF FILM"
Spartacus,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054331/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The slave Spartacus survives brutal training as a gladiator and leads a violent revolt against the decadent Roman Republic, as the ambitious Crassus seeks to gain power by crushing the uprising. In 73 B.C., a Thracian slave leads a revolt at a gladiatorial school run by Lentulus Batiatus (Sir Peter Ustinov). The uprising soon spreads across the Italian Peninsula involving thousand of slaves. The plan is to acquire sufficient funds to acquire ships from Silesian pirates who could then transport them to other lands from Brandisium in the south. The Roman Senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton) schemes to have Marcus Publius Glabrus (John Dall), Commander of the garrison of Rome, lead an army against the slaves who are living on Vesuvius. When Glabrus is defeated his mentor, Senator and General Marcus Licinius Crassus (Sir Laurence Olivier) is greatly embarrassed and leads his own army against the slaves. Spartacus and the thousands of freed slaves successfully make their way to Brandisium only to find that the Silesians have abandoned them. They then turn north and must face the might of Rome.—garykmcd Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is a rebellious slave purchased by Lentulus Batiatus (Sir Peter Ustinov), owner of a school for gladiators. For the entertainment of corrupt Roman Senator Marcus Licinius Crassus (Sir Laurence Olivier), Batiatus' gladiators are to stage a fight to the death. On the night before the event, the enslaved trainees are rewarded with female companionship. Spartacus' companion for the evening is Varinia (Jean Simmons), a slave from Britannia. When Spartacus later learns that Varinia has been sold to Crassus, he leads seventy-eight fellow gladiators in revolt. Word of the rebellion spreads like wildfire, and soon Spartacus' army numbers in the hundreds. Escaping to join his cause is Varinia, who has fallen in love with Spartacus, and another of Crassus' house slaves, the sensitive Antoninus (Tony Curtis). The revolt becomes the principal cog in the wheel of a political struggle between Crassus and a more temperate Senator named Gracchus (Charles Laughton).—Jwelch5742 In the last century before Christ, Spartacus (Kirk Douglas), a Thracian, is born into slavery, and thus being a slave is the only life he has ever known. Within his lot in life, he is a proud and principled man. He is among those slaves doing hard labor for the decaying Roman empire, before he is purchased by Lentulus Batiatus (Sir Peter Ustinov), a slave trader. At Batiatus' school, Spartacus and Batiatus' other slaves are brutally taught to fight as gladiators, purely for show, before they will be sold for a higher price. It is within this environment that Spartacus witnesses the potential kill or be killed situation of the school, those he is asked to kill or be killed by being other slaves, some like Crixus (John Ireland), who he considers friends. He vows that he will never kill a slave if he ever gets out of this situation. There, he also witnesses the depravity of those at the higher echelons of the Roman empire. Within the Roman Senate, there is a battle of philosophies between Marcus Licinius Crassus (Sir Laurence Olivier), who wants ultimate control, and more populist Gracchus (Charles Laughton). Spartacus' ultimate drive is to free all the slaves and be able to return to their respective homelands. Spartacus, as the de facto albeit reluctant leader of the slaves, is able to enact a plan to get within seventy days to the southern coast of Italy, where they can hire pirate ships to take them home. The slaves will have to fight any Roman armies along the way. Both Crassus and Gracchus know they must defeat Spartacus solely as a symbolic measure. What ultimately happens is affected by the philosophical differences between the two Senators, and Crassus' infatuation with a slave girl named Varinia (Jean Simmons), who is mutually in love with Spartacus.—Huggo With the mighty Roman Republic still standing at the very centre of the civilised world, before the birth of Jesus and the new faith called Christianity, somewhere in the conquered Greek province of Thrace, an illiterate slave woman gives birth to a proud, rebellious son: Spartacus. Sold before his thirteenth birthday, young Spartacus finds himself condemned to a lifetime of back-breaking labour in the inhuman mines of Libya, under whip and chain and scorching sun. Dreaming of freedom and the death of slavery, instead, fiercely independent Spartacus ends up in the gladiatorial school of the Roman businessman, Lentulus Batiatus, only to form a formidable revolutionary army. As Spartacus leads a slave revolt in 73 BC with his unstoppable army of former gladiators and slaves, marching straight to the Italian port of Brundisium, the ambitious and belligerent Roman senator, General Marcus Licinius Crassus, is assigned to crush the insurgents. Now, as Crassus uses the armed uprising to gain political power, more and more, cornered Spartacus and his army are caught in an inescapable trap, trapped between two armies with their backs to the sea.—Nick Riganas In 73 B.C. during the last century of the Roman Republic, thousands of people are born enslaved to either the privileged class known as patricians or the wealthiest of the commoners, known as plebeians. One exceptionally strong slave in the rock mines of Libya, a Thracian named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas), is regularly whipped for displaying his intelligence and pride. In his latest act of defiance, Spartacus viciously bites the ankle of a Roman centurion when he tries to stop Spartacus from helping another slave who fell carrying a load of rocks. Spartacus is tied down, seemingly until he dies and rots. One day, Batiatus (Peter Ustinov), who trains slaves to become gladiators, purchases Spartacus and several other slaves for his ludus (training camp) in Capua. There, Batiatus announces that each man will be taught to fight to the death strategically, for the pleasure of patricians who enjoy the ""sport.""Training proves as dehumanizing as the mines; each slave is branded, mercilessly instructed by head trainer Marcellus (Charles McGraw), and kept in cells. Spartacus tries to befriend Ethiopian gladiator Draba (Woody Strode), but soon learns that the men refuse to ally, knowing that they may be forced to kill each other in the gladiatorial arena.One night, Spartacus is presented the slave woman Varinia (Jean Simmons). Batiatus and Marcellus, knowing that Spartacus has never had a woman, watch from a grate above his cell as Varinia stoically undresses. Their laughter disgusts Spartacus, and after he refuses to mistreat the young woman, Batiatus takes her away as punishment for not acting as ""a man.""Over the next several weeks, Spartacus excels at gladiatorial skills and falls further in love with Varinia. Marcellus attempts to derail their attraction, but the couple manages to exchange furtive touches. One day, Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier), a patrician in competition with the plebeian Gracchus (Charles Laughton) for control of the Roman Senate, arrives at Capua along with his wife Lady Helena (Nina Foch), sister-in-law Claudia (Joanna Barnes) and her fiance, Marcus Glabrus (John Dall). To celebrate the betrothal, Crassus insists that a gladiatorial match be arranged, ignoring Batiatus' concern that forcing the slaves to fight to the death in their own camp could cause an uprising. Helena and Claudia choose four slaves, including Spartacus and Draba, to fight, and order them to be scantily clad in loincloths rather than armor. As the matches begin, the patricians banter happily, undisturbed by the desperation of the fighting men. Spartacus listens from the holding cell as a friend is killed, then enters into battle against Draba. Draba overcomes Spartacus, but, unwilling to kill his compatriot, instead attacks Crassus and is immediately speared by a guard and cruelly finished off by Crassus himself.Another day or two later, during meal time in the eatery area, Spartacus later hears that Crassus has bought Varinia. Marcellus smacks Spartacus across the mouth with his whip for breaking the no-talking rule. Spartacus can no longer control his rage, and attacks Marcellus, shoving his face in a pot of stew, drowning him. Emboldened, the other slaves follow suit starting a huge riot at the ludus and escape. They steal various brass and steel weapons from a nearby cart and form an ""army"" that travels across the countryside, looting landowners and freeing slaves, who then join the swelling ranks.Word soon spreads to Rome of the slave rebellion, causing outrage in the senate. While Crassus is away on business, Gracchus cannily challenges Glabrus, now head of the Roman garrison, to lead some of the troops against the slaves, leaving Julius Caesar (John Gavin) as temporary chief of the remaining garrison. When Crassus returns, he comprehends immediately that Gracchus plots to keep Glabrus out of Rome, leaving Crassus more vulnerable to attack.Meanwhile, back at Batiatus' home, a crowd of gladiators force two local patricians to fight in the arena, using torches to spur them into combat. Spartacus makes them stop, telling them they're not meant to be as cruel as the Romans. He instead inspires his troops to form a united front that can sweep across the country, freeing other slaves and eventually escape over the sea to their homelands. In one town, Spartacus is elated to find Varinia, who has escaped and now confesses her love.Back in Rome, while Crassus admires his new ""body slave,"" Antoninus (Tony Curtis), Gracchus schemes with Batiatus, who blames Crassus for Spartacus' rebellion. Soon, Spartacus' army settles at Mt. Vesuvius, where an escaped Antoninus impresses Spartacus, who longs for an education, with his talent for both music and poetry.One day, Tigranes (Herbert Lom), a representative of Salician pirates, visits to offer the slaves support. Spartacus trades the army's riches for 500 ships, to await the army on the east coast of Italy. Tigranes agrees to the trade, and when he wonders aloud why Spartacus believes he can defeat the mighty Roman garrison, the former slave replies that, unlike soldiers, his men are not afraid to die, since even death is preferable to a life in chains. Soon after, Glabrus arrives at the rebels base camp at Vesuvius and, underestimating the intelligence of the slaves, fails to prepare his troops adequately. Spartacus is able to destroy the garrison and capture Glabrus, whom he sends back to the senate with the message that the army will not be stopped. Crassus is forced to banish Glabrus and retire in shame, never to be seen or heard of again.Throughout the winter, Spartacus' ever-growing group crosses the country, many dying along the way. In the spring, Spartacus is overjoyed to learn that Varinia is pregnant. Meanwhile, Gracchus convinces the senate to name Caesar as commander of the garrison and to send two legions to destroy Spartacus. When no one volunteers to lead the legions against Spartacus, Gracchus is forced to ask Crassus, who is delighted to head the campaign to ""restore order"" to Rome. Later, Gracchus reveals to Caesar that he has maneuvered the sale of the Salician ships to Spartacus, knowing that Spartacus' triumph will spell defeat for Crassus.Although Spartacus celebrates upon reaching an encampment a mere twenty miles away from the Salician ships, Tigranes soon arrives, with the news that Pompey and Crassus have conspired to surround Spartacus' army, necessitating the withdrawal of the ships. Spartacus realizes that Crassus is forcing him to attack Rome, which will allow the patrician to use all the troops at his disposal against them. Dismissing Tigranes' offer to smuggle Spartacus and Antoninus, now his closest aide, to freedom, Spartacus instead stirs his troops to march against Rome.At the same time in Rome, the Roman Senate elects Crassus as head consul and leader of the legions, and he vows to destroy Spartacus and restore order to the empire. The armies soon come within fighting distance of each other, and Crassus, single-minded in his fear of and hatred for Spartacus, pays Batiatus to identify the former slave on the battleground. Just before the battle, Spartacus tells Varinia that his only prayer is for his son to be born free and to learn about his father's cause.During the final battle, within a few hours, Crassus' trained troops have overcome the slave army, and Crassus announces to the survivors that they will be spared crucifixion if they identify Spartacus. Spartacus stands to speak, but before he can sacrifice himself, Antoninus stands and declares, ""I am Spartacus."" One by one, each slave follows suit, choosing death over betraying the man who brought him freedom. Enraged, Crassus orders them all to be crucified during a long march, lining the Appian Way road from Brindusia to Rome with their bodies. He also finds Varinia, clutching Spartacus' newborn son, and sends her to his estate.Along the march, Crassus recognizes Antoninus and then, upon spotting Spartacus, guesses he may be his enemy, and orders the two men be kept alive until they reach his estate. There, he banishes Gracchus to the country, intending to use him in the future for his popularity with the ""rabble."" Soon after, Batiatus experiences what Gracchus terms ""a bad case of dignity"" and refuses to identify Spartacus, and instead plots with Gracchus to steal Varinia from the estate in order to irritate Crassus. Crassus dotes on Varinia, whose love he believes will prove his superiority over Spartacus but she vows never to stop loving Spartacus.Meanwhile, Spartacus mourns Varinia and his son, who he assumes have died. When Crassus confronts Spartacus, the slave spits in his face, spurring the dictator to order him to fight Antoninus to death, with the victor to be crucified. Spartacus and Antoninus fight valiantly, each trying to save the other from a more painful death, and Spartacus soon triumphs. After murmuring that he loved Spartacus like a father, Antoninus dies, and Spartacus proclaims that ""he will come back, and he will be millions."" Crassus, fearful even in his victory, orders Spartacus crucified at the gates to Rome. Meanwhile, Batiatus brings Varinia and the boy to Gracchus, who presents them with falsified papers that will allow them freedom, then kills himself.In the final scene, as Varinia leaves Rome, she catches sight of Spartacus on the cross. In his last moments of life, Spartacus sees Varinia lift his son and hears her declare that the boy, now free, will never forget his father."
La Dolce Vita,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053779/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A series of stories following a week in the life of a philandering tabloid journalist living in Rome. In 1959/1960 Rome, Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni) is a writer and journalist, the worst kind of journalist--a tabloid journalist.

Exodus,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053804/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The State of Israel is created in 1948, resulting in war with its Arab neighbors. The theme is the founding of the state of Israel. The action begins on a ship filled with Jewish immigrants bound for Israel who are being off loaded on Cyprus. An Intelligence officer succeeds in getting them back on board their ship only to have the harbor blocked by the British with whom they must negotiate. The second part of the film is about the situation in Israel as independence is declared and most of their neighbors attack them.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Following World War II, the life of the Jewish nation is uncertain. The United Nations is contemplating taking a vote on creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Until then, many Jews are exiled from much of Europe - especially Germany - and as they have no where to go, they are sent to detention camps among other places Cypress. Ari Ben Canaan, a Palestinian Jew, wants to smuggle as many Jews as possible into Palestine. In his mind, the easiest way to influence the United Nations vote is by sheer numbers residing in Palestine. Ari commandeers a ship with 600 Jews, and after some obstacles, manages to make it to Palestine. Ari grew up in a mixed Palestinian/Jewish community in Palestine. His best childhood friend, Taha, is Palestinian and is now leader of the Palestinian section of the community. Regardless of the United Nations vote, the road to Ari's dream of a peaceful Jewish homeland in Palestine will be a difficult one because despite his own model community, extremist factions, both on the Jewish side and the anti-Zionist side, will never see living together in peace and advocate violence to achieve their own ends. Within this fray is widowed American nurse, Kitty Fremont. Kitty is initially naive about the conflict and hostile toward Ari's means of achieving his goals. However, she ultimately falls in love with him and with his dream despite their religious and cultural differences.—Huggo Nurse Katherine ""Kitty"" Fremont is an American volunteer at the Karaolos internment camp on Cyprus, where thousands of Jews-Holocaust survivors-are being held by the British, who will not let them go to Palestine. They anxiously wait for the day they will be liberated.Ari Ben Canaan, a Haganah rebel who had been a decorated captain in the Jewish Brigade of the British Army in the Second World War, obtains a cargo ship and smuggles 611 Jewish inmates out of the camp for an illegal voyage to Mandate Palestine before being discovered by military authorities. When the British learn the refugees are in a ship in the harbor of Famagusta, they blockade the harbor and prevent it from sailing. The refugees stage a hunger strike, during which the camp's doctor dies, and Ari threatens to blow up the ship and the refugees. The British relent and allow the Exodus safe passage.Kitty has grown very fond of Karen Hansen Clement, a young Danish-Jewish girl searching for the father from whom she was separated during the war. She has taken up the Zionist cause, much to the chagrin of Kitty, who had hoped to adopt Karen and take her to America to begin a new life.During this time, opposition to the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states is heating up. Karen's young beau Dov Landau proclaims his desire to join the Irgun, a radical Zionist resistance group. Dov goes to an address given him by an Irgun recruiter, only to be caught in a police trap. After he is released, he is contacted by members of the Irgun and is interviewed by Ari Ben Canaan's uncle Akiva, who is the head of the Irgun. Before swearing Dov in, Akiva forces the boy to confess that he was a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz, and that he was sodomized by Nazis. Due to his activities, Akiva has been disowned by Ari's father, Barak, who heads the mainstream Jewish Agency trying to create a Jewish state through political and diplomatic means. He fears that the Irgun will derail his efforts, especially as the British have put a price on Akiva's head.Karen has gone to live at Gan Dafna, a fictional Jewish kibbutz near Mount Tabor near the moshav where Ari was raised.[8] Kitty and Ari have fallen in love, but Kitty pulls back, feeling like an outsider after meeting Ari's family and learning of his previous love: Dafna, a young woman kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by Arabs, who is the namesake of the Gan Dafna kibbutz.Leaving Kitty, Ari promises to help find Karen's father. Dr. Clement is eventually found in a mental hospital in Jerusalem. He is in a dissociative state, withdrawn to a degree that borders on the vegetative. Because of the horrors he experienced in a concentration camp, he has completely disconnected from the outside world. He does not recognize Karen, who is devastated.When the Irgun bombs the King David Hotel in an act of terrorism resulting in dozens of fatalities, Akiva is arrested, imprisoned in Acre fortress, and sentenced to hang. Seeking to save Akiva's life, as well as to free the Haganah and Irgun fighters imprisoned by the British, Ari organizes an escape plan for the prisoners. Dov, who eluded the soldiers who captured Akiva, turns himself in so he can use his knowledge of explosives to facilitate the Acre Prison break.All goes according to plan. Hundreds of prisoners, including Akiva, escape from the prison. Akiva is mortally wounded by British soldiers while evading a roadblock set up to catch the escapees. Ari is also badly wounded. He makes his way to Gan Dafna, where Dr. Lieberman, head of the village, removes a bullet from his right lung. With the British on Ari's trail, he is taken to Abu Yesha, an Arab village near Gan Dafna, where his lifelong friend, Taha, is the mukhtar. Kitty goes with him and provides postoperative treatment that saves his life. The romance between Ari and Kitty is rekindled as a result. Meanwhile, Dr. Lieberman is arrested by the British when they learn the camp has stored illegal weapons within the children's village.An independent Israel is now in plain view, but Arab nationals commanded by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, plot to attack Gan Dafna and massacre the Jews, including the children. Ari receives prior warning of this attack from Taha, even as Taha reluctantly decides he must join the Grand Mufti in fighting the establishment of Israel. Ben Canaan spirits the younger children to safety in a nighttime evacuation as a small detachment of Palmach troops arrives to reinforce the defenses of Gan Dafna.Karen, ecstatic over the prospect of the new nation, finds Dov (who was on patrol outside Gan Dafna) and proclaims her love for him. Dov assures her that they will marry as soon as the war is over. As Karen returns to Gan Dafna, she is ambushed and murdered by a gang of Arab thugs. Dov discovers her lifeless body the following morning.The same day, the body of Taha is found hanging in his village, killed by ex-Nazis working for the Grand Mufti. A Star of David is carved on his body. A swastika and a sign saying ""Jude"" is written on the walls of the village, indicating the Arabs' hatred of the Jews.Karen and Taha are buried together in one grave. At the burial ceremony, Ari swears on their bodies that someday, Jews and Arabs will live together and share the land in peace; not only in death, but also in life. While the others each add a shovelful of dirt to the grave, Dov angrily steps on the shovel and leaves, refusing to accept Karen's death. The movie ends with Ari, Kitty, Dov, and a Palmach contingent boarding trucks, heading off to battle."

As of November 1, 1959, mild mannered C.C. Baxter has been working at Consolidated Life, an insurance company, for close to four years, and is one of close to thirty-two thousand employees located in their Manhattan head office. To distinguish himself from all the other lowly cogs in the company in the hopes of moving up the corporate ladder, he often works late, but only because he can't get into his apartment, located off of Central Park West, since he has provided it to a handful of company executives - Mssrs. Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger - on a rotating basis for their extramarital liaisons in return for a good word to the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake. When Baxter is called into Sheldrake's office for the first time, he learns that it isn't just to be promoted as he expects, but also to add married Sheldrake to the list to who he will lend his apartment. Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger are now feeling neglected as Baxter no longer needs their assistance in moving up.—Huggo Of all the ways to climb the corporate ladder, C.C. Baxter, a loyal, resourceful, and cooperative clerk in a giant Manhattan insurance firm, has come up with the fastest: lend the key of his convenient bachelor apartment to his womanising bosses.

Sheldrake, who, of course, wants a piece of the action. Now, Baxter can really give his career a boost; however, is there any room left for his blossoming love life?—Nick Riganas Bud Baxter is a struggling clerk in a huge New York insurance company.

He often has to deal with the aftermath of their visits and one night he's left with a major problem to solve.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a lonely office drone for an insurance company in New York City. Four different company managers take turns commandeering Baxter's apartment, which is located on West 67th Street on the Upper West Side, for their various extramarital liaisons. Unhappy with the situation, but unwilling to challenge them directly, he juggles their conflicting demands while hoping to catch the eye of fetching elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Meanwhile the neighbors in the apartment building assume Baxter is a ""good time Charlie"" who brings home a different drunken woman every night. Baxter accepts their criticism rather than reveal the truth.The four managers write glowing reports about Baxter a little too glowing, so personnel director Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) suspects something illicit behind the praise. Sheldrake lets Baxter's promotion go unchallenged on condition that he be allowed to use the apartment as well, starting that night. Sheldrake gives Baxter two tickets to The Music Man to ensure his absence. Delighted about his promotion, Baxter asks Kubelik to meet him at the theatre. She agrees and it is revealed to the audience that she is Sheldrake's girlfriend, intending to break off their affair that night but is instead charmed by Sheldrake to the apartment. Baxter is disappointed at being stood up, but is willing to forgive Kubelik.At an office party on Christmas Eve, Baxter discovers the relationship between Sheldrake and Kubelik, though he conceals this realization, while Kubelik learns from Sheldrake's secretary that she is merely the latest female employee to be his mistress, the secretary herself having filled that role several years earlier. At the apartment, Kubelik confronts Sheldrake with this information and while he maintains that he genuinely loves her, he leaves to return to his family. Meanwhile, a depressed Baxter picks up a woman in a local bar and, upon returning the apartment, is astounded to find Kubelik in his bed, fully clothed and overdosed on Baxter's sleeping pills.Baxter sends his bar pickup home and enlists the help of his neighbour, a physician, in reviving Kubelik without notifying the authorities. The doctor makes various assumptions about Kubelik and Baxter, which Baxter concedes without revealing Sheldrake's involvement. Baxter later telephones Sheldrake and informs him of the situation, and while Sheldrake professes gratitude for Baxter's quiet handling of the matter, he avoids any further involvement. Kubelik recuperates in Baxter's apartment under his care for two days, during which he tries to entertain and distract her from any possible suicidal afterthoughts, talking her into playing numerous hands of gin rummy, though she is largely uninterested.Baxter and Kubelik's absence from work is noted and commented on, with Baxter's former ""customers"" assuming that Baxter and Kubelik were having an affair. Kubelik's taxi-driver brother-in-law comes looking for her and two of the customers cheerfully direct him to Baxter's apartment, partly out of spite since he has been denying them access since his arrangement with Sheldrake. The brother-in-law also assumes the worst of Baxter and punches him several times.Sheldrake, angered at his secretary for sharing the truth with Kubelik, fires her. She retaliates by telling his wife about his infidelities, leading to the breakup of the marriage. Sheldrake moves into a room at his athletic club and continues to string Kubelik along while he enjoys his newfound bachelorhood. Baxter finally takes a stand when Sheldrake demands the apartment for another liaison with Kubelik on New Year's Eve, which results in Baxter quitting the firm. When Kubelik hears of this from Sheldrake, she realizes that Baxter is the man who truly loves her and abandons him, running to the apartment. Baxter, in the midst of packing to move out, is bewildered by her appearance and her insistence on resuming their earlier game of gin rummy. When he declares his love for her, her reply is the now-famous final line of the movie: ""Shut up and deal."""
The Alamo,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053580/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1836, a small band of soldiers sacrifice their lives in hopeless combat against a massive army in order to prevent a tyrant from smashing the new Republic of Texas. In 1836, General Santa Anna and the Mexican Army is sweeping across Texas. To be able to stop him, General Sam Houston needs time to get his main force into shape. To buy that time he orders Colonel William Travis to defend a small mission on the Mexicans' route at all costs. Travis' small troop is swelled by groups accompanying Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, but as the situation becomes ever more desperate Travis makes it clear there will be no shame if they leave while they can.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The legendary true story of a small band of soldiers who sacrificed their lives in hopeless combat against a massive army in order to prevent a tyrant from smashing the new Republic of Texas.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> In February 1836, Texas is part of Mexico, and most of the English and Spanish speaking settlers of that region are discontent with the tyrannical rule of Gen. Santa Anna. General Sam Houston (Richard Boone) arrives in a small town with several men where he hastens to assemble a Texan army. At the same time, Santa Anna is heading north with several thousand soldiers to defeat the rebellion. To gain more time, Houston orders Col. William Barret Travis (Laurence Harvey) to take command of the Alamo, a fort in a crumbling mission near the village of San Antonio de Bexar, through which Santa Anna's men must pass. Houston hopes that Travis and his 27 ""regular"" army men will stall the enemy for as long as possible with the assistance of rancher Col. James Bowie (Richard Widmark) and his 100 Texas volunteers. The hard-drinking and independent Bowie, who has extensive landholdings to protect, and the aristocratic and arrogant Travis are a poorly matched team and antagonism between the two officers quickly grows.Although Juan Seguin (Joseph Calleia), a respected community leader, reports that Santa Anna is closer than they realize, Travis refutes the information and repeatedly lies to the men about the danger of their situation. Believing that most men have no capacity to act for reasons of honor, Travis tells his confidant, Capt. Almeron Dickinson (Ken Curtis), that the men would desert their posts if they knew the truth.Meanwhile, Colonel David Crockett (John Wayne), a former U.S. Senator, and his rowdy, but loyal 32-strong Tennessee backwoods sharpshooters, arrive in Bexar and head straight for the cantina. Travis seeks out ""Davy"", and is surprised to learn that the reputed ""illiterate country bumpkin"" is an eloquent, deep thinker and is sensitive to the Texans' plight. Aware that Santa Anna's regime forbids Texans economic rights, Davy has also guessed the unpublicized plans to create a Republic of Texas. Unknown to his men, who think they are out for adventure, Davy has brought them to Bexar to investigate the situation and possibly convince them to join the fight.Crockett soon falls in love with Flaca (Linda Cristal), a young Mexican woman whose family was killed by Santa Anna and who is being pressured to marry Emil Sande (Wesley Lau), a local merchant who has curried favor with the Mexican general. Although she refuses Davy Crockett's gallant offer of help, she tells him about the cache of ammunition Emil has hidden for Santa Anna in the basement of the village church. During the night Crockett, Bowie and their men find the supplies. When Emil discovers Davy and the others and tries to kill them, Davy throws Bowie's knife at Emil, killing him.Crockett and Flaca enjoy a brief romance, but he soon sends her north to safety, realizing they may never see each other again. Travis keeps up the morale in the fort by reporting that Captain Jim Fannin is on his way to the Alamo with more soldiers. Believing that staying cornered inside the fort is suicide, Bowie unsuccessfully tries to convince both Travis and, later, Davy that the best way to defend the Alamo is by a ""cut, slash and run"" approach out in the open. Davy Crockett convinces his men to fight for the Alamo by reading them a letter, purportedly written by Santa Anna, ordering the Tennesseeans to leave. Offended, the men stubbornly refuse to take orders from the Mexican general and vow to stay, after which Davy admits that he wrote the letter himself, but it is what Santa Anna would want.A detachment of Mexican soldiers arrive at San Antonio and a courier from Santa Anna arrives outside the Alamo fort, and from there, proclaims a message ordering the ""occupiers"" of the fort to relinquish all ammunition and leave. Before the courier can finish the message, Travis uses his glowing cigar to light the cannon. Startled by the cannon fire, the Mexican halts his reading and retreats in a dignified manner. Dryly, Bowie comments to Davy that Travis ""knows the short way to start a war.""Over the next few days, Mexican soldiers are taking positions in front of the fort. Travis predicts that fighting will not begin until Santa Anna himself, the Mexican heavy artillery and food wagons arrive, which will take several days. Believing the situation is hopeless, Bowie decides to leave with his men. However, when Captain James Butler Bonham (Patrick Wayne) arrives from another camp, reporting that Fannin is coming with one thousand men, Bowie decides to stay, unaware that Bonham has been ordered by Travis to lie about the number of men accompanying Fannin. In private, Bonham reports to Travis that only less then 500 men are expected. A quarrel between Bowie and Travis escalates into plans for a duel after Bowie takes his men out on patrol without Travis' permission, but Crockett convinces them to postpone their confrontation until after the war.Confronted by Crockett, Travis admits that his orders are simply to buy time for Houston. Believing that the mission is worthwhile and knowing that Bowie plans to leave with his men in the morning, Davy gets him drunk, causing him to sleep late. The next day, Seguin sneaks into the fort with a few dozen more men, bolstering morale and boosting the Alamo garrison from 150 to 185 men.One night, when a message is delivered directly to Bowie, bypassing Travis, the commander accuses Bowie of more insubordination. However, Travis apologizes after he learns that the message reports the death of Bowie's wife.When the doctor reports low rations and an outbreak of dysentery caused by tainted water, Travis orders a night-time raid of the Mexicans, from whom they rustle several steer. They also steal a good horse for a young teenage soldier, Smitty (Frankie Avalon), one of Crockett's men, to ride to Houston's encampment to report their situation.On Day 10 of the siege, Santa Anna arrives with the main body of his army (numbering at least 2,000 men), he sends his messenger forward to allow the evacuation of the women and children. Most of the women and children leave, but Mrs. Dickinson (Aissa Wayne) insists that she and her young child will stay. After the rest of the noncombatants are safely away, the shooting commences. The Mexicans launch a full frontal assault on the south side of the Alamo.During the battle, the first Alamo casualty is Davy's friend Parson (Hank Worden), who is wounded by artillery fire. Before he dies, he inspires Davy Crockett to pray that his men are successful, and if not, will be remembered as good men. In the face of devastating fire, Santa Anna orders a retreat. At the end of the battle, the Alamo men have shot many of the Mexicans leaving hundreds of casualties in front of the fortress, but they suffer 50 casualties, twenty-eight of whom are dead. Bowie is wounded in his right leg by shellfire, but he still can fight.After the battle, men also receive news from Captain Bonham that Fannin's company was ambushed and routed, and consequently no further help will be coming. When Crockett expresses a desire to leave, Travis speaks truthfully to the men, telling them that they will not be able to hold the fort for long, but they have given Houston 10 extra days to prepare for Santa Anna. Giving his blessing, Travis opens the gate and claims there is no dishonor in leaving. Crockett and Bowie begin to lead their men out, but then Bowie gets off his horse and stands next to Travis. The others follow suit and soon all decide to persevere.The next day, Smitty delivers his written message to Houston at his camp and immediately rides away, anxious to return to his comrades, refuses both food and sleep. Upon reading the message, Houston, who is helpless to assist Travis, hopes that their sacrifice will be remembered.At the Alamo, the sleepless men talk about their belief in the hereafter. Bowie frees his aged slave Jethro (Jester Hairson) and urges him to sneak out and make his way north, but Jethro chooses to stay.On the morning of Day 13 of the siege, the entire Mexican army surrounds the Alamo for a determined final assault. Santa Anna and his staff officers take position atop a small hill to observe the battle as the entire 2,000-strong Mexican army attacks from all sides. The Texans fire back and inflict many more casualties on the attacking Mexican soldiers. During the final battle, Bowie is shot in his right leg again and taken to the infirmary, while Crockett and his men hold the south side of the fortress.Just then, Mexican artillery begins to take its toll among the defenders and cannon fire breaches the north wall, allowing hundreds of Mexican soldiers to enter the fortress. Travis takes on several Mexican troops until he his shot and killed. As Mexican soldiers and engineers breach the west wall with ladders, they manage to push the Texans back despite suffering horrendous casualties. The Mexicans also use captured Texan cannons to breach each position of the Texans one by one, sparing none of them.Seeing the breach in the north wall and despite the futility of the defense, Crockett orders a barricade thrown up in front of the Alamo church itself as he and the few surviving defenders are forced back. The Mexicans quickly overwhelm the Texans with their sheer numbers and breach all barricades. The Alamo defenders fight to the last man, with the Mexicans taking no prisoners. Davy Crockett is fatally stabbed with a Mexican lance by the dismounted soldier, whom he manages to kill. Before dying, Crockett sets fire to the ammunition to prevent the Mexicans from taking it. Near the end of the battle, Mexican soldiers entering the infirmary are shot by Bowie as he fires guns with both hands. Jethro throws himself over his former master to protect him, but both are slaughtered. Only Mrs. Dickinson, her child and a young black boy survive.In the final scene, the Mexicans have won the battle. Mrs. Dickinson, her young daughter and the slave boy are given a burro and allowed to leave without harm by Santa Anna. Smitty arrives, but from a distance he sees that he is too late to help. As Mrs. Dickinson walks away, Santa Anna orders his buglers to single a rise to call as all the Mexican soldiers stand at attention to salute the fallen Alamo defenders and allow Mrs. Dickinson to walk away. She soon joins Smitty in the distance and they walk away from the battle to tell the tale of the Alamo.The End"

The neighbor is over having a cup of tea with Gloria's mom, and doesn't miss an opportunity to direct a sarcastic and biting comment to Gloria when the chance comes. Gloria tells her mother that she spent the night at Norma's apartment, which the neighbor scoffs at. While Gloria goes to shower, she gets a call from Butterfield 8 (the phone code used to call the upper east side in the 1960s), connecting Mr. Ligget to her.

She says that she'll be in the neighborhood, and hangs up.Meanwhile, Weston Ligget, known as ""Wes,"" travels upstate New York by train with his friend, whom he formerly worked with in a law practice. The friend can tell that Wes is troubled, and after Wes complains about married life, he tells him that he is a first-class heel. He offers him a job at the law firm again, whenever Wes would like, but Wes seems resigned to his job - which soon is revealed to be a leading role in his wife's family chemical company.Wes arrives at his wife's family home, and shoots skeet with his wife Emily. She has been staying with her mother while the mother was ill, but Wes did not join her.

Gloria said that she always knew this would happen, and said that she had to see her friend Steve for his birthday - and to give him the case. When he goes to hang her coat, she gasps when she sees the mink still hanging in the closet.

She decides to stay at Happy's Motel to clear her head. The next morning, having a cup of coffee with Happy, Happy warns her of her story.

Emily says that she saw her last night when Wes came home - and asked if he really loved her. Wes said that he was angry with Gloria, but it was only because he loved her so much, and was afraid of losing her. He leaves, while Emily sinks to the bed in tears.Gloria is back at her mother's apartment, saying goodbyes to the mother and the neighbor before leaving with her suitcases. She is leaving for Boston - a fresh start. Wes, at the same time, tries to call Gloria, but the number has been disconnected. Butterfield 8 tells him that she has moved on to Boston - and Wes quickly sets off to chase after her. Awhile down the thruway, he sees her car parked at a roadside diner. He goes and apologizes to Gloria, begs her to come back with him. He says that he wants to get married, try again. Gloria cries, saying that it will never work, because her past will always be on his mind, and the hateful words he said to her yesterday will never leave hers. After begging, she finally agrees to go to Happy's Motel to talk. When they both arrive, Gloria has a change of heart, and squeals back onto the road. Wes gets into his car, and chases her.They speed down the thruway, until Gloria notices that he is chasing her. She speeds up, and it quickly turns into a deadly high-speed chase. While looking in the rear-view mirror, Gloria doesn't see that the road is closed up ahead, and drives off of a large embankment, to her death. Wes runs to see if he can save her, but she is clearly dead in the wreck. When the coroner and police arrive on the scene, the police officer is the same officer that had pulled her over earlier. He says that he wished he had put her in jail that night instead.Wes arrives at home, and tells the story to Emily. Emily is very upset for him. Wes tells her that he will be leaving, to find his pride again, and that he will return to see if they will be of any use to each other in the future. As he leaves the door, the movie ends."

Shephard's previous command was at sea, and he makes it known that he would prefer to be in command of a ship again.Shephard is just settling in when an urgent message arrives stating that two large German warships have been sighted passing through the Baltic Sea, en route for the open waters of the North Atlantic. The prospect that it could be a breakout attempt by the Bismarck alarms the British Admiralty. Once in the Atlantic, the powerful Bismarck and her escort vessel could wreak havoc on British convoys at sea.A British agent in southern Norway is alerted to take up watch along the coast, and he soon observes Bismarck and the cruiser Prinz Eugen steaming westward. He returns to his cabin and gets off a partial telegraph message before a German patrol traces his signal and shoots him. But he has sent enough to confirm the worst British fears. A Spitfire reconaissance plane is dispatched to find the ships and manages to photograph them in a Norwegian fjord, but the German vessels sneak out unseen under the cover of foul weather.Now the British must further spread their thin naval forces in order to block all three major passages into the Atlantic. In the end, the Germans steer for the Denmark Strait between Iceland and Greenland. The famous battle cruiser HMS Hood and the brand new battleship Prince of Wales lie in wait. Prince of Wales has been pressed into service so quickly that civilian shipyard workers are still aboard.Early in the morning, the two German ships emerge out of a swirling mist and are surprised to find the heavy British naval units awaiting. Hood opens fire, followed by Prince of Wales. The German ships respond and several salvoes are exchanged. Suddenly, the Hood explodes in a gigantic fireball, breaking in two and sinking in a matter of seconds. A well-aimed German salvo had plunged down through the Hood's thin deck armor and ignited a magazine. The stunned men aboard Prince of Wales have only a few seconds to absorb the unspeakable tragedy before both German ships shift their fire to her. Prince of Wales is quickly mauled and forced to withdraw from the battle. But Prince of Wales has also hit the Bismarck, inflicting damage that reduces her ability to continue on with commerce raiding. The Bismarck's captain, Lindemann, wants to pursue the crippled Price of Wales and finish her, but he is overuled by Fleet Admiral Gunther Lutjens, who is aboard as overall commander of the mission. Lutjens doesn't want to further jeopardize his ships in a costly engagement with British naval units.Only three British sailors survive from the Hood's complement of 1,500 men. It is a great victory for Nazi Germany, one that must be avenged. Prime Minister Winston Churchill orders that the Bismarck be hunted down and sunk at all costs. Captain Shephard's son is serving as an aerial gunner aboard the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, based at Gibraltar. The ship is immediately ordered into the fight. Meanwhile, Prinz Eugen is successfully detached from the Bismarck to proceed independently.A torpedo strike is launched from another aircraft carrier, HMS Victorious, but it fails to seriously damage the Bismarck. Bismarck maintains her speed and soon slips away from the British ships shadowing her. An air search is initiated from the Ark Royal, with Captain Shephard's son aboard one of the Swordfish torpedo bombers involved. Back at the Admiralty, Captain Shephard receives a telephone call with the heartbreaking news that his son's plane ran out of fuel and failed to return to the ship. Devastated, the emotionally remote Captain opens up and tells Anne that his wife had been killed when a German bomb destroyed their home. Their son is all that he has left.It is determined that Bismarck is now on a course for the French port of Brest, where she can make repairs and perhaps join up with the twin German battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to form a devastating armada. The mighty German battleship is now only hours away from the protective cover of German U-boats and land-based aircraft from France. The British must slow her down somehow, and their big ships can't catch up in time. A torpedo strike from the aircraft of Ark Royal represents their last opportunity.The frail, aging Swordfish biplanes take off from Ark Royal and manage to locate Bismarck. Despite intense anti-aircraft fire, the determined pilots press the attack. One torpedo strikes the stern of the Bismarck and permanently jams her rudder. It is a stroke of luck for the British. Bismarck is now unable to steer, allowing her desperate pursuers to close the distance.At the Admiralty, Captain Shephard receives wonderful news. His son has been rescued from a life raft and is safely aboard a destroyer. Alone in his office, Shephard loses control and breaks down in tears. Anne allows him a moment of privacy before entering to inform him that the pursuing British battleships have come within range of the Bismarck. The final act is about to begin.HMS King George V and HMS Rodney open the battle with their 14- and 16-inch guns, pounding the German ship. Admiral Lutjens is determined to fight to the last shell, and the Bismarck is soon a raging inferno. One by one, her gun turrets are put out of action. Another big shell destroys the bridge, killing Lutjens and Lindemann.The British battleships, now critically low on fuel and ammunition, break off the engagement and head for home. Destroyers are left to fire torpedos into the battered hulk. Only a relative handful of survivors are rescued. Hood is avenged.Back in London, Shephard is congratulated on a job well done. He looks at his watch and asks Anne to join him for dinner, believing it to be nine o'clock in the evening. She accepts, and as they emerge from the depths of the Admiralty building, they are greeted by morning sunlight. Their dinner plans are changed to breakfast plans as they stroll across Trafalgar Square."

The Magnificent Seven,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054047/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Seven gunfighters are hired by Mexican peasants to liberate their village from oppressive bandits. A bandit terrorizes a small Mexican farming village each year. Several of the village elders send three of the farmers into the United States to search for gunmen to defend them. They end up with seven, each arriving with his own reason. They must prepare the town to repulse an army of 30 bandits who will arrive wanting food.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> When their small village is once again attacked by the bandit Calvera, three Mexican farmers head north to try to buy guns. They ask Chris Adams to help them, but he suggests they hire experienced gunmen instead. He soon recruits five others and eventually accepts a sixth he had initially rejected, but who made saying no impossible for him. Together, they develop a plan to secure the town and defend it against Calvera's attack. In that time, friendships are formed and love blossoms between one of the men and a beautiful local girl, but not all of them will survive the attack.—garykmcd Constantly pillaged by ruthless Calvera's marauding gang of bandits, a small Mexican village of farmers is on the brink of poverty. Intent on fighting back, the terrorized inhabitants summon up the courage to send three of their men to the first dusty town near the United States border, in high hopes of purchasing weapons; instead, they have a chance encounter with the taciturn Cajun gunslinger, Chris Adams. Now, the defenseless peasants have not one, but seven lethal defenders who are ready for war. Do Calvera's toughs stand a chance against the fearless Magnificent Seven?—Nick Riganas Ruthless Calvera's banditos regularly raid Mexican villages, leaving barely enough to survive after another backbreaking season's harvest. Hilario and his neighbors have had enough and decide to deputize a trio, after selling the villagers' last 'treasures' to buy guns so they can fight back. Across the US border, they meet gun hero Chris Larabee Adams, who is regularly challenged pointlessly by would be-champions like young Chico. He finds their budget meager and pointless without shooter skills, hence suggests they hire men for the job instead. He's persuaded to assemble a team for the relative pittance, which surprisingly amounts to seven in need of income, including self-invited Chico, whose farm boy kills prove as useful. The village is fitted with defenses and the men are given basic training. the element of surprise prevails at unsuspecting Calvera's first attack, but his sworn revenge sounds daunting for many villagers to reconsider their commitment, now obviously to the death, while knaves and even females are drawn into the effort, adding to the seven's motivation.—KGF Vissers A Mexican village is periodically raided for food and supplies by bandits led by Calvera (Eli Wallach). As he and his men rode away from their latest visit, Calvera had promised to return for more booty and loot the village again. Taking what meager goods they have, the village leaders ride to a town just inside the American border hoping to barter for weapons to defend themselves. While there, they encounter a veteran gunslinger from Dodge, Chris (Yul Brynner); after listening to their tale, Chris suggests that the village hire more gunfighters as they would be cheaper than guns and ammunition. The village men relentlessly try to convince Chris to be their gunman; while at first he agrees just to help them find men, eventually he decides to help them out in person as well as finding six other men to join them, despite the poor pay offered.The other men include hotheaded, inexperienced Chico (Horst Buchholz); Chris's friend Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) who believes Chris is seeking treasure; the drifter Vin (Steve McQueen), who has gone broke after a round of gambling and is loath to accept a position as a store clerk; Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), a gunfighter of Irish-Mexican heritage who has fallen on hard times; a cowboy, Britt (James Coburn), who joins for the challenge involved; and an on-the-run gunman Lee (Robert Vaughn) in the midst of a crisis of confidence. The group recognizes they will be outnumbered, but hope that when Calvera realizes that the village has brought them aboard, he will move on to a different village.Arriving at the village, the seven begin to train the villagers how to defend themselves. They all find themselves bonding with the villagers, sharing the meal the women of the village have made them when they discover that the villagers have little food themselves. Chico is fascinated by Petra, one of the village's young women, while Bernardo begins to bond with three of the village's little boys. Lee, meanwhile, struggles with nightmares and fears the loss of his skills. Calvera and his bandits soon arrive, sustain heavy losses, and are run out of town by the gunmen and the villagers working in concert. Chico, who is Mexican, follows Calvera back to his camp, pretending to be one of the gang of bandits. There he learns that Calvera plans to return and raid the village because he is desperate for the food in order to feed his men.Chico reports this back to Chris and the rest of the men. Though a part of the group believes they should leave, Chris insists that they stay and they ride out to make a surprise raid on Calvera's camp. However, they find the camp empty and, on returning to the village, they find that the fearful villagers allowed Calvera to take control. Calvera spares the gunmen's lives, believing they have learned the lesson that the simple farmers are not worth fighting for. Calvera also fears reprisals from the U.S. Army. The seven are curtly escorted out of the village. The group debates their next move and all but Harry agree to return and free the village from Calvera. Harry believes the effort will lead to their deaths and rides off alone.A gunfight breaks out, and the villagers, recognizing the courage of the gunmen, soon join in the fight. Bernardo is killed protecting the children he had befriended, and both Britt and Lee die after killing a considerable number of bandits. Harry, who had a change of heart, arrives in time to protect Chris but is fatally shot. Soon, the bandits are routed, and Chris shoots Calvera. Calvera, in his dying breath, asks him, ""You came back ... to a place like thiswhy? A man like youwhy?""The three remaining gunmen help to bury their own and the villagers' dead. Chico announces he will be staying with Petra, while Chris and Vin begin to ride out. The village elder bids them farewell and comments that it is only the villagers who have really won: ""You're like the wind, blowing over the land and ... passing on ... ¡Vaya con Dios!"" However, as they leave and pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris fatalistically observes, ""The Old Man was right. Only the farmers won. We lost. We always lose."

13 Ghosts,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053559/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A family inherits what proves to be a haunted house, but a special pair of goggles allows them to see their ghostly tormentors. Reclusive Dr. Zorba has died and left his eerie mansion to his penniless nephew Cyrus Zorba and his family. Along with the house, the Zorba family has also inherited the occultist's collection of 13 ghosts, who can only be seen through Zorba's special goggles. The family members, their lives at risk upon the discovery that Dr. Zorba's fortune lies hidden somewhere in the house, receive aid from unexpected quarters as the threat to their lives is revealed.—Doug Sederberg <vornoff@sonic.net> Cyrus Zorba works at a local museum but is having trouble providing for his wife and two children. Their furniture has just been repossessed and they're not too sure what they're going to do when lawyer Ben Rush tells Buck his late uncle, a Doctor Zorba, has recently died and left him his house. The doctor, they are told, had perfected a way to collect ghosts. There are currently 12 living in the house, the doctor's diary had space for a 13th. Who will be the thirteenth ghost to join them?—garykmcd The Los Angeles based Zorbas - paleontologist father Cyrus, mother Hilda, young adult daughter Medea and young teen son Buck - have just inherited a furnished old mansion from Cyrus' recently deceased uncle, Dr. Plato Zorba, a widely dismissed but wealthy occultist. This inheritance coincides with Buck's birthday wish that they have a furnished house in which to live, as they have always rented, and their furniture often repossessed because of Cyrus' forgetfulness to save money or pay the bills. The will states that they have to live in the mansion or else it reverts back to the state. The lawyer, Benjamen Rush, tells them that the mansion also comes with a housekeeper, the witch-like Elaine Zacharides who decides to stay until she can find other arrangements, and the ghosts that Plato collected from around the world. The Zorbas brush off the notion of ghosts as crazy. Ben, however, does believe in the ghosts' existence, that belief based on what he saw of Plato when Plato was alive. Living at the mansion, the Zorbas do believe that there are ghosts there which Plato tried to control as part of his work. They also believe that they are in possible mortal danger because of the ghosts. While Hilda wants to leave, Cyrus wants to stay as he believes Plato willed the mansion to him for a reason, and he is determined to find out what it is, even at the risk of their lives. There is also the issue of Plato's vast monetary fortune, which some believe may be hidden in the mansion.—Huggo Cyrus Zorba works in a museum and is completely broken. His wife Hilda Zorba calls him and tells that their furniture has just been takes since he has not paid the installments. During the night, Cyrus, Hilda and their teenage daughter Medea Zorba celebrate the birthday of their son and brother Buck Zorba, who is a fan of horror books, and he wishes to have a house of their own with furniture. Out of the blue, Cyrus learns that he has inherited an old mansion from his uncle Dr. Zorba. He visits the lawyer Benjamen Rush that tells that the house is haunted and he can not sell it. Further, together with the house, he receives the weird housekeeper Elaine Zacharides, a hidden treasure and the collection of 12 ghosts that belonged to Dr. Zorba, who was a master of the occultism. The family moves to the mansion and soon Cyrus discovers a set of special goggles that makes possible to see the ghosts. When Buck accidentally discovers the hidden fortune in the house, the ambitious Benjamin lures the boy with the intention of stealing the money for him. But Dr. Zorba's ghost is also in the house and will protect his family.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The movie opens with eerie music and a darkened screen followed by screams and moans and splotches of paint thrown at the screen. Each ghost and its number appears with the number thirteen as a ""?"". Titles and credits follow.The opening shot is the front (south entrance) of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Cyrus Zorba (Donald Woods) is a paleontologist and is lecturing to a group of college students. He encourages them to visit the La Brea Tar Pits. He is interrupted by his boss, Mr. Van Allen (John Van Dreelen), who tells him his wife needs to speak to him on the telephone. Hilda Zorba (Rosemary DeCamp) tells her husband their furniture is being repossessed, again! Payments are three months overdue. Cy is a poor money manager and very forgetful. She reminds him that it is Buck's birthday, so don't forget his gift. Buck Zorba (Charles Herbert) arrives home to an empty house. ""Why do they always take our furniture?"" he asks his mother knowing the answer.The cake says, ""Happy Birthday, Buck"" and contains eleven candles. His sister, Medea (Jo Morrow) gave her brother a tome of ""Ghost Stories."" They eat on the floor, as all the furniture is gone. Buck makes a wish and prepares to blow out the candles. His wish is for, ""A house with furniture that no one could take away from us."" At that a gust of wind blows out the candles. Simultaneously the doorbell rings. Cy answers it. He sees no one at the door. He ventures out into the darkness a few steps and a short, cadaverous man (David Hoffman) asks, ""Mr. Cyrus Zorba?"" He hands him a telegram then disappears into the darkness. Cy opens and reads the telegram out loud. He is to report at 10:00 a.m. to an attorney's office. Medea looks up his name in the phone book and tells her father he's in the Petrol Building.The next morning Cy and Hilda Zorba appear at the law office of Benjamin Rush (Martin Milner). Ben Rush tells the pair that Cy has inherited a house from his uncle, Dr. Plato Zorba. It includes furniture, but Ben tells them they will be disappointed. It is a fifty year old house in need of work. A wrapped package sealed with wax was also included in the inheritance. According to Ben Rush, Dr. Zorba was his client for a year and he had collected ghosts from all over the world. ""You inherit them too,"" he warns. Cy and Hilda chuckle in amusement, but Ben is dead serious, reiterating, ""They go with the house."" Ben leaves to get a notary. They open the package and find a wooden box. When they open it a gust of wind blows the papers around the lawyer's desk. Inside is a pair of peculiar looking glasses. A fly buzzing around the room annoys Hilda, who keeps brushing it away. It lands on the glasses and explodes like it was a bug zapper.Ben drives up to the house to see Cy about more paperwork. The family has moved into the house. It is a large Victorian place, very overgrown and obviously untended for years. Ben encounters Buck skating on the porch. Buck is excited about the house and claims they have a ""live"" witch living there. When Ben rings, Medea answers, much to Buck's annoyance. He wanted the housekeeper, Elaine Zacharides (Margaret Hamilton) to answer as she usually does. Medea introduces herself to the lawyer and is instantly attracted to him. She invites him in. Elaine is on the stairs and holding a broom. She glowers at Ben and the children, and turns and walks upstairs. They discuss Plato Zorba and his picture over the fireplace. Ben explains the ghosts had nearly killed him and altered his appearance, ""back broken, face torn to shreds, lips ripped away."" He tells Medea he wishes they had not moved into the house. Medea invites Ben to stay for dinner. Cy finishes signing all the paperwork for the house and they discuss ""the witch."" Cy explains they can't pay her, but she begged to stay on until she found something else. Ben explains she must have money, as Zorba paid her well. Buck finds a OUIJA board and brings it to the table. Buck explains he pushed something on the fireplace and a door opened. Buck walks over to the fireplace, pushes a button and the door opens revealing a deck of cards, the book and the planchette. Cy retrieves the planchette and hands it to Buck. He removes the white bound book. It is written in Latin. Medea suggests they play with the OUIJA board. Cy explains how the board works. All five put a finger on the planchette. Ben asks, ""Is Medea in Love?"" Buck asks a question, ""Are there any ghosts in this house?"" The pointer goes to Yes, despite Hilda and Ben saying they pushed towards No. After that, just Medea and Buck play with the board. He asks, ""How many?"" It answers 13. Medea asks, ""Are they going to hurt us?"" It points to Yes. Ben warns Medea, ""Don't fool around with that thing anymore."" Buck finally asks, ""Are they going to kill any of us?"" The glass framed portrait of Dr. Zorba falls off the wall and nearly kills both Buck and Medea. The planchette starts moving on its own, levitating above the couch and landing in Medea's lap.Cy and Hilda prepare for bed. Hilda is scared. Cy explains to his wife if they don't live in the house it goes to the state. Cy opens the box and pulls out the glasses. Hilda complains of a freezing draft. The flowers on a table wilt. Cy checks on the children and then goes downstairs for a book. Down in the living room we see some of the ghosts re-enacting their crimes, perpetrators and victims. Cy hears moaning and is drawn to the source. He walks down a hallway and opens a door that leads to a walled up room. He presses on it and it slides open. The moans are louder. He turns on a light. This must have been Zorba's laboratory. Someone whispers ""13"" over and over. He puts on the glasses and sees the book burning. He looks up to see four apparitions floating in midair. The four burst into flames and scream. He is attacked by a pinwheel of fire. He takes the glasses off. The door open and he retrieves his Uncle's book. The number ""13"" is seared into his flesh on the back of his right hand.The next morning at work he asks Mr. Van Allen how the translation is going on the book. Van Allen has a hard time putting it into words. He refers to a University Publication from ten years prior. It is about Plato Zorba and his solicitation of haunted houses so he can photograph ghosts. The book is a record of his work. There is a chapter for each ghost. One is from Ireland, a couple from Italy and one from Tibet is mentioned. ""I, Plato Zorba, am the twelfth."" The phone rings and Van Allen answers it. It is Hilda again, and she demands Cy return home immediately.The ghost of a chef kills his wife with a cleaver. When Cy gets home there is commotion in the kitchen. The floor is a mess of broken plates. Hilda tells her husband they just flew off the shelves. They watch as a can of flour pours itself on the floor. Hilda says, ""I have had enough, Cy."" A bottle of milk floats over the mess and falls. Buck walks into the kitchen and explains, ""That was Emilio."" He was an Italian chef who killed his wife and two other in-laws. The final act is a cleaver that flies across the room and imbeds itself in the wall, nearly hitting Cy. Hilda pleads with Cy to move out now. Elaine appears and answers some of Cy's questions. She tells him she helped Dr. Zorba with his work. She adds that Zorba turned against her. Zorba converted all his wealth into cash. She and Ben searched the house after his death but found nothing. Cy asks about Zorba's death. Elaine shows him Zorba's bedroom. She lights a few candles and tells Cy he died in bed, the official cause of death was suffocation. Elaine pleads with Cy that he and his family should leave tonight. A gust of wind blows out the candles, and then they relight themselves. One candle levitates over to the bed, directing attention to a switch that raises and lowers the canopy. Cy operates the switch.Ben and Medea return home from a date. Everyone in the house is asleep. In Zorba's bedroom a man with cobweb covered pants and dirty shoes walks towards the door. Medea turns out her light and goes to bed. The figure walks the house. It opens Medea's bedroom door. She is awakened to a window banging. She gets up to latch it. The visage of Dr. Zorba approaches her. She screams and walks backwards. Elaine goes into her room and reopens the window.The next morning Buck makes his bed and then slides down the bannister. Two one-hundred dollar bills appear and float to the floor, unnoticed. He takes the glasses and walks down into the basement. He finds an old trunk and opens it. He finds a lion tamer's hat and whip used by Shadrack the Great. He opens an empty cage and is floored by a lion's roar. He puts the glasses on and sees both the ghost of the lion and the headless Shadrack. He is both frightened and fascinated. Buck takes Medea her breakfast. He sees the $200 and picks it up. The doorbell rings--it is Ben. Ben notices and asks about the money. Buck brings his sister her tray. Ben tells Buck that, ""there's a treasure hidden in this house."" Ben wants Buck's help finding it.Ben stops at the Museum to see Cy. Ben tells Cy that he thinks he can arrange for the state to pay for the house and grounds. Ben is a little too anxious to get the Zorba family out of the house. Van Allen comes in an reads a passage from the book, ""Today, I finished converting my assets into cash and put it where unscrupulous men can no longer steal it from me."" Van Allen suggests he find Elaine to get some answers. Cy explains Elaine is the housekeeper. Van Allen suggests a séance to converse with Dr. Zorba.That evening Elaine holds a séance with Medea, Hilda and Cy. She will act as medium. Cy retrieves his glasses as Buck slides down the bannister again. He finds more money, wiggles the balustrade posts and it opens a hidden door. Behind the door is a stack of money. Dr. Zorba speaks through Cy. He puts the glasses on and sees Zorba materialize from his portrait, but not the distinguished man in the picture, but a disfigured visage. Ben shows up at the house and Buck shows him the money. Ben tells him to go to bed, and then follows him upstairs. Dr. Zorba's ghost inhabits Cy. He says, ""Death tonight, one of you."" Zorba returns to his portrait. Cy wants to know more, but Elaine deflects the questions and predicts, ""Tonight death walks again in this evil house.""Ben is in Dr. Zorba's bedroom dressed up as the visage of Dr. Zorba. He is wearing the cobweb pants and dirty shoes, but not the mask. He checks the switch on the bed's canopy mechanism. Ben steals into Buck's bedroom and lifts the sleeping child. He takes him to Dr. Zorba's bedroom and places him on the bed. Ben activates the canopy switch and watches it slowly descend. The ghosts react to the impending murder of a child. Through a ventilation duct, a mist appears. Ben sees Dr. Zorba's ghost. It approaches as Ben retreats. It directs Ben to the bed and forces him under the lowering canopy. Buck wakes, runs out of the way and screams. He sees Zorba's ghost hold Ben under the canopy. The family rushes into Zorba's bedroom.The next morning they are counting cash. Cy explains to his daughter that Ben murdered Dr. Zorba and tried to find the hidden money. Elaine calls the family to breakfast. Buck asks Elaine, ""You really are a witch aren't you?"" Elaine replies, ""Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies."" She tells Buck the ghosts will be back. The glasses levitate above a table and explode. Elaine takes a broom, smirks, and exits the room. We close with a panning shot around the inside of the house, and see the ghosts again. The front door closes and ""House for Sale"" appears."

It's early spring, and she is tasked with bringing candles to church for matins. She convinces her mother to let her wear her Sunday best if only in her want to look pretty. The church is in the nearest village which is still a good distance away, even by horseback. As such, she convinces her parents to allow Ingeri, their pregnant maidservant, to accompany her. Ingeri is secretly envious of Karin if only because of her own lost innocence. Ingeri prays to the Norse God Odin, her latest thoughts to Odin which are against Karin. Out of circumstance, Karin and Ingeri part company half way through their trek. Ingeri encounters a one eyed man, who she ultimately steers away from despite he being what she wanted.

When clumsy Seymour Krelborn spoils two of a client's flowers, his boss Gravis Mushnick is ready to fire him from his flower shop until Seymour says he has mixed two different breeds of plant at home to create the ""Audrey Jr."" hybrid. Mushnick agrees to give Seymour another chance, and the next day Seymour brings in Audrey Jr., which becomes Mushnick's pride and joy and draws interest from his other employee Audrey Fulquard and more and more of their clients. Suddenly the plant ails, and Seymour accidentally learns that she likes blood. Upset because he doesn't know how to feed her, he walks along the railroad track and throws a stone that accidentally hits the head of a man who falls on the track and a train runs over him.

But how will Seymour feed his plant again?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Bumbling florist Seymour is always being berated by his surly boss, Gravis Mushnick. To avoid being fired, Seymour brings into the shop a strange hybrid flower he has nurtured and named Audrey Jr. after his co-worker and crush. When Seymour tries to feed the plant, he discovers that it can talk and it lives off human flesh. Seymour reluctantly starts to kill people and bring their bodies back to the shop for Audrey Jr.'s lunch; as the plant continues to grow, it becomes the shop's main attraction. Mushnick soon becomes suspicious of what Seymour is feeding the plant. So do the local police.—Anonymous Although he tries hard, mild-mannered, accident-prone Seymour Krelborn is in jeopardy of losing his job at Mushnick's Florist on Skid Row in Los Angeles for one mistake too many. Seymour is able to convince his boss, the store's owner Gravis Mushnick, to give him one more chance when the unique new plant he cultivated thrives at the store and brings in new customers. The prehistoric-looking plant, which he named Audrey Jr. after his coworker (and secret crush) Audrey Fulquard, sickens, then perks up when Seymour learns what it needs to grow: human blood, and lots and lots of it. Seymour stumbles onto a temporary solution when he accidentally kills a man. He must decide to go into the murder business to fulfill the needs of the plant that is making him famous and potentially wealthy in that fame. One factor in his decision is how Audrey Jr. affects his relationship with Audrey; Mushnick complicates matters when he learns what the plant thrives on; and the police are investigating a series of missing-person cases and suspect that the victims have been murdered.—Huggo Seymour Krelborn, a young florist-shop assistant, creates a carnivorous plant that feeds on human flesh and soon convinces him to start killing people. His boss is thrilled when the plant brings much more business to the shop, and his co-worker and crush is thrilled that he named the plant after her. But people start to wonder what nourishes the fantastic plant.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Seymour Krelboyne (Jonathan Haze) is a clumsy assistant at an unassuming flower shop on the dreary Skid Row in Los Angeles. His boss, Gravis Mushnick (Mel Welles) is constantly frustrated with him, and is on the verge of firing him. Seymour's co-worker, the beautiful and sweet Audrey Fulquard (Jackie Joseph) begs Mushnick to give Seymour another chance. A customer, Burson Fouch (Dick Miller), who has visited countless florist shops to indulge his flower-eating habit, advises them to feature more strange and unusual plants to attract more business. Mushnick is desperate for more customers, since their only steady client is the elderly Mrs. Shiva (Leola Wendroff), who buys flowers for the funerals of her constantly-dying relatives. Seymour mentions that he had been developing an odd new plant, a cross between a venus flytrap and a butterwort. Mushnick makes him a deal: if the new plant brings in more business, Seymour may keep his job. A hopeful Seymour rushes home to get the plant.Seymour lives in an apartment with his hypochondriac mother, Winifred (Myrtle Vail). The plant, potted in a coffee can, is a strange vertical pod surrounded by leaves. After bringing it back to the shop, Mushnick agrees it is interesting, but notices it looks sickly. Seymour promises to nurse it back to health, although he is unsure of how to feed it since water, sunlight, and high-quality plant food have seemed to do no good. Seymour shyly admits that he named the plant ""Audrey Junior"" after his crush. The original Audrey is delighted.Alone in the shop that night, Seymour continues to study the plant. Every night at sunset, its pod opens like a mouth. Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant and Audrey Jr's pod opens wider. Seymour now understands that the plant feeds on human blood. Desperate to save it, Seymour gives it a few drops from his finger and leaves for the night. The next morning, Audrey Jr has grown dramatically, and customers begin flocking in to see the strange new attraction. Though he is becoming increasingly weak, Seymour feeds the plant blood from his own fingers every night. He refraines from telling anyone the secret behind Audrey Jr's health.A dizzy and anemic Seymour can no longer provide his own blood for the plant. As Audrey Jr grows hungrier, it begins to demand food in a human voice (Charles B. Griffith). Frustrated, Seymour takes a walk at night and stops by the train tracks, chucking a rock in anger. To his horror, the rock hits a nearby man who falls onto the tracks and is run over by a speeding train. Seymour is terrified, but he collects the man's body parts and takes them back to the shop for Audrey Jr's dinner.Mushnick and Audrey are celebrating she shop's sudden success at a fancy restaurant, when Mushnick realizes he had left his wallet at the shop. While Audrey waits at the table, Mushnick returns to work and sees Seymour feeding human meat to the plant. Seymour is not aware he was being watched, and a shaken Mushnick returns to the restaurant (without his wallet) and demands copious amounts of alcohol.Mushnick considers going to the police and turning in Seymour, but decides against it to preserve the shop's steady business flow. Seymour arrives at work with a toothache, and Mushnick sends him to the local dentist, Dr. Farb (John Shaner), who is something of a sadist and attempts to pull several of Seymour's teeth. Seymour defends himself by attacking Farb with a sharp dental tool, eventually stabbing him to death. Horrified, Seymour arranges the body in the dentist's chair to resemble a patient, while he himself dons the dentist's uniform. An odd customer, Wilbur Force (Jack Nicholson), an extreme masochist who goes to the dentist for a pain fix, insists that Seymour (who he assumes is Dr. Farb) drill and pull his teeth. Seymour reluctantly agrees, and Force leaves happy. Seymour then collects Dr. Farb's body and brings it back to Audrey Jr.Two police investigators, Joe Fink (Wally Campo) and Frank Stoolie (Jack Warford) arrive at the flower shop to investigate the two recent disappearances. Mushnick acts very nervously, but the men assume he knows nothing and leave. Seymour is becoming a local celebrity, and has worked up enough courage to ask Audrey on a date, which she gleefully accepts. A representative from the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California visits the shop and admires Audrey Jr, who is now seven feet tall. The woman announces that her organization wants to award Seymour a trophy, which they will present the following night when the plant's large buds are scheduled to open.Seymour and Audrey visit Winifred, who prepares a dinner solely consisting of different medicines. Mushnick stays at the shop, keeping close watch over the plant. Audrey Jr demands food, but Mushnick refuses to indulge it. Soon, a robber enters the store and threatens Mushnick at gunpoint for money. Disappointed by what he finds in the cash register, the robber demands to know where the rest of the loot is kept. Mushnick, attempting to kill two birds with one stone, lies to the robber and says that the rest of the money is hidden in the bottom of the huge plant. The robber climbs in to Audrey Jr's pod and is eaten. Audrey Jr quickly grows healthier.Seymour becomes fed up with the plant, as it is damaging his relationship with Audrey. He angrily refuses to continue feeding it, but Audrey Jr verbally hypnotizes Seymour, sending him out with the singular goal of bringing back another victim. A dazed Seymour encounters a persistent call girl (Meri Welles) whom he knocks unconscious with a rock and hauls back to the shop for Audrey Jr's next meal.The next evening, Seymour's trophy ceremony is underway. An audience, including Winifred and the two investigators, has assembled and waits eagerly for the plant's buds to open. As they do, the attendees are shocked to see a human face in each new flower, each belonging to one of the plant's meals: the man from the railroad tracks, Dr. Farb, the robber, and the call girl. In a panic, Seymour flees the shop and is pursued by Mushnick and the investigators who lose his trail when Seymour hides in a junkyard. He returns to the empty shop in a rage as Audrey Jr demands more food. Blaming the plant for ruining his life, Seymour grabs a knife and climbs into the plant in an attempt to kill it from the inside. When Mushnick and the others return, they see Audrey Jr has sent up a new flower; this one with Seymour's face."

Mughal-E-Azam,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054098/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A 16th century prince falls in love with a court dancer and battles with his emperor father. Set in the 16th century AD, the movie brings to life the tale of the doomed love affair between the Mughal Crown Prince Saleem and the beautiful, ill-fated court dancer, whose fervor and intensity perpetrates a war between the prince and his father the great Mughal Emperor Akbar, and threatens to bring an empire to its knees.—Hrishi Dixit <hrishi@slb.com> Badshah Akbar was the supreme ruler of Hindustan and ruled this country fairly and justly. He wanted the Hindus and Muslims to live as a big family; encourages all religious groups to live in harmony together; and even undertakes a barefoot journey to the temple of Ambe Maa and installs a gold umbrella over Ambe Maa. He married a Hindu Rajput Yodhabai, and together they sire a son who they name Saleem. Born in a very tolerant and acceptable atmosphere, Saleem also witnesses war and perhaps this does have an affect on his mind. He then falls in love with a lowly courtesan, Anarkali. When his parents want him to get married to a woman of their choice, he refuses and wants to marry Anarkali. This angers the tolerant Akbar, who could never visualize his son marrying a mere dancing girl. He has Anarkali imprisoned, but Saleem arranges her escape and incites a open revolt against Akbar. Enraged, Akbar declares Saleem a traitor and sends his armies to crush him. Saleem is defeated and brought in chains to be sentenced by his father, but Anarkali managed to elude his armies. Akbar wants to trade Saleem's life with that of Anarkali, but Saleem will not let anyone know where Anarkali is, and is therefore sentenced to die. Watch the climax, to the tunes of ""Zindabad...Zindabad...."" of this blockbuster as Saleem is tied to a tower and a huge cannon is aimed at him to blow him to bits in front of everyone present.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) The land of the sacred Ganga and the towering Himalayas has given the world some personalities whose ideals were resplendently as pure as the water of the Ganga and whose aims were lofty as the Himalayas. Four hundred and sixty two years ago, a man named Jalaluddin Mohammed Akbar was born in this land of the Hindustan. History has recorded that this Mughal Emperor sprinkled the dust of the motherland with his blood. 'Mughal-E-Azam' is a page from the golden history of the land of Akbar. Jalaluddin Mohammed Akbar was a lover of Hindustan. And his son Nuruddin Mohammad Salim loved a frightened little palace main, Anarkali. In this tussle, the destiny of Hindustan trembled, and the future of the country was imperiled. On one side was an emperor's responsibility towards an ever-growing empire, his plans, his problems and his political complications. On the other side were perfumed silken tresses kissing the broad shoulders of a prince in love.—Sujit R. Varma Emperor Akbar (Prithviraj), who does not have a male heir, undertakes a pilgrimage to a shrine to pray that his wife Jodhabai (Durga Khote) give birth to a son. Later, a maid brings the emperor news of his son's birth. Overjoyed at his prayers being answered, Akbar gives the maid (Jillo Bai) his ring and promises to grant her anything she desires.
Akbar loves India and works to win the hearts of the population.The son, Prince Salim, grows up to be spoiled, drunk, flippant, and self-indulgent (he likes to spend his time witnessing dances of courtesans). His father sends him off to war under the care of Raja Man Singh (Murad), to teach him courage and discipline. Fourteen years later, Salim returns (Dilip Kumar) as a distinguished soldier. Durjan Singh (Ajit) is Man Singh's son and Salim's trusted advisor on the battlefield. Happy with Salim's victories on the battlefield, Akbar orders him back to court.Jodha is delirious and asks Tansen (Surinder) to writes melodious poems and Sculptor (Kumar) to produce beautiful formations to get Salim to forget the tribulations of war.
The sculptor could not complete his creation in time and puts the live model in front of Salim, covered in lax, to make it seem like a sculpted rock. Salim is mesmerized with the beauty of the statue. Later, Bahar realizes that the sculptor had put a live model in place of the unfinished statue. The statue was of Nadira. The next morning, Bahar publicly requests Salim to unveil the statue by cutting the rope, with his arrow, hoping that Salim would miss and kill Nadira, but Salim does not miss. Nadira reveals herself to be a human and not statue.Salim falls in love with court dancer Nadira, whom the emperor has renamed Anarkali (Madhubala), meaning pomegranate blossom (for her courage in front of Salim's arrow). Suraiya (Sheila Dalaya) is Nadira's best friend. She plays mediator between Salim and Nadira and shuttles their letters and love notes to one another. Nadira refuses Salim's advances as she is a dancer and he is a prince of Hindustan. The match will never be sanctioned. Salim meets Nadira at night, putting social customs at risk, and expresses his love for her and convinces her to love him. Durjan Singh warns Salim repeatedly against this forbidden love.
The relationship is discovered by the jealous Bahar (Nigar Sultana), a dancer of a higher rank, who wants the prince to love her so that she may one day become queen. Bahar is very close to queen Jodha Bai. Unsuccessful in winning Salim's love (By defeating Nadira in front of Salim in a singing contest), she exposes his forbidden relationship with Anarkali (after she sees Salim kissing Nadira in the royal garden, in the middle of night). Due to his love with Nadira, Salim was ignoring affairs of the state, further angering Akbar. Akbar orders Nadira to be imprisoned.Salim demands her release from the royal dungeons, but Akbar refuses. Despite her treatment, Anarkali refuses to reject Salim, as Akbar demands. Akbar orders Nadira to convince Salim that she only loved him to get the title of Queen and her love was fake. Bahar tells Salim that Nadira has been released as she has agreed to renounce Salim. Salim cannot believe it. That night, in Sheesh Mahal, Anarkali dances and reaffirms her love for Salim, in front of a livid Akbar.Akbar responds by again imprisoning Nadira. Salim pleads to marry Anarkali, but his father refuses and imprisons her. Jodha tries to explain to Salim that Nadira cannot be the empress of Hindustan. Salim agrees to renounce all his rights to the throne in exchange for Nadira, but Akbar is not willing compromise (even though Jodha also pleads with Akbar to give Anarkali to Salim). Akbar sends Salim to the front to keep him away from palace.As Salim departs, Akbar wants the sculptor to marry Anarkali. The sculptor refuses the royal order.
Salim rebels and amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Akbar decides to enter the battle himself, and Jodha refuses to give his sword to him (saying she cant chose between her husband and her son). Akbar orders Durjan Singh to kill Anarkali, but Durjan had promised Salim to keep Anarkali safe. So, he smuggles Anarkali out of prison (at the cost of his own life) and brings her to Salim. At that time, Akbar was in Salim's tent trying to convince Salim that he should not clamor for war over this issue. Seeing Anarkali in Salim's tent, Akbar is again livid and firmly resolved to go to war. As war erupts, Salim asks Durjan Singh to hide Anarkali.Defeated in battle, Salim is sentenced to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince's life and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her sentence is carried out, she begs to have a few hours with Salim as his make-believe wife (Salim had promised her this, and Anarkali didn't want Akbar to be left in the debt of her promise given by the future Emperor of Hindustan). Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment.As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favor, as it was she who brought him news of Salim's birth. Anarkali's mother pleads for her daughter's life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive."

Does Helen represent some kind of possible redemption for Mark - or is she unknowingly running the risk of becoming one of his victims?—Eugene Kim <genekim@concentric.net> Filmmaker and photographer Mark Lewis (Karl Heinz Böhm) spends days searching for just the right female models for his films which are studies of fear. He was raised by a psychologist father who used Mark as a subject for his own studies of fear and the exposure has left him marked psychologically so that he now is compelled to continue his search for women he murders for the camera as he films their reactions. Mark lives in the upper floors of his family house where he also has his photo lab and rents the downstairs to Helen Stephens (Anna Massey) and her blind mother Mrs. Stephens (Maxine Audley) whom he avoids until one day on Helen's birthday when the young nubile girl introduces herself to the photographer and they feel a connection. Mark trusts Helen enough to show her the films that his psychologist father took of him as a boy and the images disturb the girl but draws her closer to Mark. Mark's jobs as studio camera man for a film studio and cheesecake photographer for a local photo shop allows him easy access to women whom he murders while photographing to show their reactions to fear. When Helen accidentally sees some of his killing films she is appalled but wants to help Mark but the release of his secret is too much to bear as the police close in."

He attempts, without success, to transfer their faces to his daughter.—io Near Paris, the brilliant and famous surgeon Dr. Génessier destroyed the face of his beloved daughter, Christiane, in a car wreck. He becomes insane, trying to restore her face through successive transplants of the faces of pretty women abducted by his assistant Louise.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On a night just outside Paris, a woman drives along a riverbank and dumps a corpse in the river. After the body is recovered, Dr. Génessier identifies the remains as those of his missing daughter, Christiane Génessier, whose face was horribly disfigured in an automobile accident that occurred before her disappearance, for which her father was responsible. Dr. Génessier lives in a large mansion, which is adjacent to his clinic, with numerous caged German Shepherds and other large dogs.Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his assistant Louise, the woman who had disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.Louise lures a young Swiss girl named Edna Grüber to Génessier's home. Génessier chloroforms Edna and takes her to his secret laboratory. Christiane secretly watches her father and Louise carry Edna to the lab, and then goes to tenderly caress the dogs her father keeps caged, who eagerly accept her love, and are unaffected by her appearance.Dr. Génessier performs heterograft surgery, removing Edna's face. The doctor successfully grafts the skin onto his daughter's face and holds the heavily bandaged and faceless Edna against her will. Edna escapes, but falls to her death from an upstairs window. After disposing of Edna's corpse, Génessier notices flaws on Christiane's face. Her face grows worse within days; the new tissue is being rejected and she must resort to wearing her mask again. Christiane again phones Jacques and this time says his name, but the phone call is interrupted by Louise.Jacques reports the call to the police, who have been investigating the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics. The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl choker, whom Jacques recognizes as Louise. Inspector Parot, an officer investigating Edna's disappearance, coerces a young woman named Paulette Mérodon (recently arrested for shoplifting) to help investigate by checking herself into Génessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. Génessier. Génessier is about to begin surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police want to see him.While the doctor talks with the police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an abandoned German Shepherd he'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit-maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring his face in the process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks slowly into the woods outside Génessier's house with one of the freed doves on her hand."

The Time Machine,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054387/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man's vision for a utopian society is disillusioned when travelling forward into time reveals a dark and dangerous society. On January 5, 1900, a disheveled lookingH.G. Wells- George to his friends - arrives late to his own dinner party. He tells his guests of his travels in his time machine, the work about which his friends knew. They were also unbelieving, and skeptical of any practical use if it did indeed work. George knew that his machine was stationary in geographic position, but he did not account for changes in what happens over time to that location. He also learns that the machine is not impervious and he is not immune to those who do not understand him or the machine's purpose. George tells his friends that he did not find the Utopian society he so wished had developed. He mentions specifically a civilization several thousand years into the future which consists of the subterranean morlocks and the surface dwelling eloi, who on first glance lead a carefree life. Despite all these issues, love can still bloom over the spread of millennia.—Huggo From the book by H.G. Wells, a scientist and tinkerer builds a time machine and uses it to explore the distant future where there are two races, a mild gentle race, and a cannibalistic one living underground. His machine is stolen by the underground race and he must risk being captured (and eaten) to return to his own time.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The movie opens with a man walking down the street having just left a building in late-Victorian era London. It's wintertime, and the man pulls his coat around himself and hurries across the street. He knocks on the door of a house there, and a woman in late middle age lets him in. There he joins three other men who are sitting around the fire. The man's name is David Filby, and he and the three other men have been invited to dinner by George, who owns the house. He asked them to come over at 8:00 p.m., and it's just now 8, but George himself has yet to arrive. The date is January 5, 1900. The men are clearly unhappy about being kept waiting. A moment after 8, the woman, whose name is Mrs. Watchett, George's maid, enters the room and passes Filby a note. She tells them that George has been missing for several days. The note says that George thought he might be late, and if he was, then she should serve dinner and they could start without him.They enter the dining room and sit down with their drinks, still complaining about George's absence. The door opens just then and George is there, looking very dishevelled, with noticeable cuts and bruises and torn clothes. He made it only a few minutes late. All the men, plus Mrs. Watchett, are concerned for his welfare, but he insists that he is OK, and he has ""all the time in the world"". He begins to tell the story of what happened to him. It begins five days earlier, on the night of December 31, 1899, when George and his four friends had been together in the same house, in the parlor that the men had left minutes earlier.On that evening, George had told them about his experiments, how it was easy to move through the three spatial dimensions, but man had yet to figure out a way to travel through the fourth dimension, time. George hoped to invent a way to do so. He had spent two years working on a device to do so. His friends remain skeptical of his claim. He asks them to witness a demonstration of a small scale model. He opens a box on the table to reveal a machine, which he can hold comfortably in his hands, consisting of a seat, a control panel with a switch in front, and a rotating disk in back, surrounded by a brass railing. His friends think he might be a little nutty when he tells them how it can move not through space, but through time. George borrows a cigar from one of his friends, and bends it and puts it in the little model's seat to represent the man who is time traveling, then, using one of his friends' fingers, pushes the switch forward. The disk on the back starts to rotate, and in a few seconds, the machine fades and vanishes from sight. It is gone into the future, never to return.George's friends look around for the machine, at first thinking that he had performed a conjuring trick and the machine was simply somewhere else now, but George insists that it had not moved in space, but in time. The machine was still in exactly the same space on the table, but could be far in the future when the table upon which it stood or even the entire house might not exist any more. While George's friends are discussing what they have witnessed, George expounds on his theories and states his intention to take a time trip himself. His friends are concerned, wondering if George's inventing skills might be better put to use advancing the interests of his home country, Great Britain. The Boer War is going badly and the War Office might need some help. Still pondering what has been demonstrated, George's friends leave the house, wishing him a happy new century.George returns inside and discovers that one of his friends, David Filby, is still there. Filby tells him that he was still worried that George had been behaving oddly and had changed a lot. George tells him he is preoccupied with time because he is unhappy with the time he lives in, with its constant wars and strife. Filby initially thinks that George intends to travel to the past, but George says he prefers the future. Filby can think of all that the machine could do, and implores George to destroy it because the technology is so dangerous. He invites him to come and spend New Years with him, but George declines, saying he'd rather spend New Years alone. Filby asks George to promise him he won't leave the house tonight, and George promises he won't walk out the door. Then he invites Filby to come and bring the others over for dinner on Friday, January 5, 1900, five days hence. Filby leaves and George writes the note that he would read five days later. It's about 6:30 p.m. He wishes Mrs. Watchett a good night and then hurries off to his laboratory.There is another time machine there, only this one is full-sized, big enough for George to climb into. George examines it for a short time, removes the glass-knobbed control lever for a little tinkering. He lights a candle in the corner and works on the handle for a moment, then returns to the machine and climbs in. Turning on the power switches, he looks down at the control panel which shows today's date, December 31, 1899. He nudges the handle forward slightly, and the disk behind him begins to rotate. After a few seconds, he pulls the handle back to the neutral position and looks around. Nothing seems to have changed, until he notices the clock in the corner. It was after 8 p.m., and the candle he had lit was several inches shorter. Checking his pocket watch, which had been with him in the device, he saw that it still showed only a little after 6:30 p.m.George pushes the handle forward again a little further this time, and this time he watches time pass. As he watches, the candle burns down and goes out. The hands on the clock spin around. The sun comes up and moves rapidly across the sky. A snail races across the floor. Flowers open and close with the daylight. The sun goes down and comes up again, all in the time he perceives, inside the time machine, as only a few seconds. He sees people across the street at Filby's department store and sees the female dummy in the window. George notes that he is still traveling slowly and pushes the handle forward a little more, and the time progression outside the machine accelerates. Days pass by rapidly, and George improves his handling of the machine. He slows the machine down in the summer of 1900, and the alternating daylight and darkness slows, George looks across the street and sees the dummy in the department store window dressed differently. Bemused by the changing fashions, George continues to watch the clothes on the dummy change as he continues his journey into the future. Going faster, George watches the seasons change outside his windows instead of just days and nights. He was into the 1910s now. Suddenly, the light was gone - the windows had been boarded up. George brought the machine to a stop in September 1917, and got out to investigate.His laboratory was dirty and filled with cobwebs, and entering the rest of the house, he found it in the same condition. It had been abandoned for an indeterminate amount of time. All the furniture was covered in drop cloths, and these were covered in a thick layer of dust. All the clocks in the parlor were silent, since no one was there to wind them or set them. A mouse skittered across the floor. George walks outside, after kicking aside the boards that were covering his door, to see the outside of the house abandoned and neglected, too. A wooden fence had been erected around the house. George went through it and crossed the street, walking towards Filby's store, which was still there. He saw an early automobile, something he'd never seen before in his own time. A man wearing a soldier's uniform got out, and George recognized his friend Filby! Delighted, George began to speak to him. When George mentions Filby's lack of a mustache, Filby realizes that George has confused him with his father. This man is James Filby, who was the infant son of David Filby in George's time. David Filby had been killed in the The Great War (World War I) which George knew nothing about. George asks James Filby about the house across the street (his own house) and James tells him that the guy who owned it had disappeared around the turn of the century. It had fallen into David Filby's hands, who refused to sell it, thinking that George might return to claim it some day. The house had acquired a reputation as being haunted. George is dejected and realizes he's out of place, and makes his goodbyes and returns to his own house. He stops outside to pull some of the boards off his laboratory window so he can continue to watch the dummy in the store window.George returns to the machine, gets in, and heads into the future once more. The house is still neglected and the windows break. He watches the dummy in the window as he speeds through the 1920s and 1930s. Then, in 1940, the room starts to shake. Thinking the machine might be malfunctioning, George brings it to a stop in June 1940, only to discover that the disturbance came from outside. There are airplanes outside (something else he'd never seen before) dropping bombs with anti-aircraft guns shooting at them and fires burning in the distance. He realized that this was a new war, and he pressed on into the future to see how it went. Shortly afterward, his laboratory caught fire and disappeared. His house had been destroyed by a German bomb, and George was out in the open, safe within the time machine. He continues through the 1940s and watches as construction workers build a new large building not too far away. The fashions on the dummy in the window continue to change.George hears a strange sound and brings the machine to a stop once more, this time in August of 1966. The sounds were air-raid sirens. He gets out of the machine and looks around. The ground that his house once stood on now looks like an urban park. Men and women walk through it in a hurry, urged by men in uniforms to get into the air-raid shelters. He looked out at the street, seeing many skyscrapers in the distance, and Filby's store had expanded to fill a whole block, with a substantial building of its own. Baffled by the commotion, George reads a plaque he finds in the park: ""This park is dedicated by James Filby to his father's devotion for his friend George.""The people have mostly disappeared into the underground air-raid shelters. George looks at Filby's store, and just then an aged James Filby wearing a silvery uniform walks out on his way to the shelters. George stops to talk to him, extremely impressed by the growth of the store and the whole city. James just wants to get into the shelters as quickly as possible before the mushroom clouds appear, another phrase George doesn't understand. James suddenly realizes that George looks familiar, and George tells him that he talked to him in the same place, in front of the store, back in 1917 - 49 years earlier. James recognizes him as the same man but how could he possibly have not changed in such a long time? The talk is cut short when the air-raid sirens go off again, and James points to the approaching nuclear bomb and hurries off to the shelter. George lingers outside, then starts to walk back to his time machine, when the bomb goes off. George is far enough away from it not to be incinerated, but the buildings around him burst into flame and fall apart as he watches. London, built brick by brick over two thousand years, is obliterated in seconds. The explosion caused a geological disturbance, and a volcano appeared and lava flowed down the street, destroying anything in its path that had not been destroyed by the bomb. George jumped back into the time machine and escaped into the future before the lava could reach it. The lava cooled around the time machine, forming a casing of stone. George sped into the future, waiting for erosion or other natural forces to wear the rock away.Thousands of years in the future, the rock eroded and George was once more out in the open, but the bleak, desolate landscape offered no hints that a city or even mankind had ever stood there. He watched trees grow. He could no longer detect changing seasons. Then he saw new buildings going up, but they appeared more primitive than the ones he had left behind. As he sped forward through the centuries, he watched a dome and a tower being built and then fall into disrepair and ruin. Curious once again, George stopped the machine on October 12, 802701. He stopped too fast, and the angular momentum from the suddenly stopped spinning disk caused the machine to spin around and fall over. Shaken but unhurt, George got out, righted it, and set out to explore.There was a large stone building behind him, with a large metal statue on top that looks kind of like the statues on Easter Island. There are two large metal doors in the building. George knocks on them (clang!) but no one answers, and he cannot open them. George takes the glass-knobbed control handle out of the time machine, just in case, and then goes to explore the forest. The trees are laden with large, delicious-looking fruits, and he finds some more ruins, but he does not yet find any humans. After passing through the forest, he finds the dome he saw earlier. It was neglected and almost in ruins, but it was obviously still in use. It still had functioning doors, and there were tables and chairs and dinnerware inside when he entered.There were no people, so George left the dome and went back to the forest. Continuing to walk, he at last hears voices in the distance. Finally he comes across some people, in a clearing in the forest by the river. All of them were blond-haired, dressed in plain clothes, and fairly young. They were laughing and playing, and George thinks at first that this is the future he had hoped for, where war, work, and hardship had been left behind in the past. Then he spots a woman in the river, obviously in distress. She is not able to swim through the current and seems to be in imminent danger of drowning, yet none of the other people do anything to help, just staring as the woman screams. George runs into the clearing and urges them to take action, then dives into the river and rescues the woman when they do nothing. The people just look at him.The people get up and walk away, laughing and chattering, and they go to the dome that George left not long earlier. George follows them but lingers on the stairs. The woman he saved comes back to talk to him. She talks softly and slowly and appears to not quite be all there. She seems to think nothing of the fact that none of the other people tried to save her from drowning. She tells him her name is Weena, and her people are called ""Eloi"", but she is dumbfounded when he asks her to spell it. The people are illiterate. Weena encourages George to come with her into the dome, because it is getting dark.Inside the dome, the people are eating the fruits laid out before them on the table. George tries to talk to some of the other Eloi people, but they are exceptionally poor conversationalists. Besides losing written language, he learns that the Eloi have no government or laws, and no one works. The food simply grows without being cultivated. The Eloi seem to have all the free time in the world, but they don't even study or experiment or learn anything. They have lost their human curiosity as well.George asks an Eloi man if there is any way he could learn about the Eloi culture, such as from books, and the man tells him that there are indeed books. He shows George the books, which are in a dusty, long-neglected room in the back. George picks up a book which appears to be in terrible shape, and he discovered how terrible it is when he opens it to find the words faded to near-illegibility, a page crumbles to dust when he tries to turn it, and the whole book fragments to pieces in his hand. The books had been left to rot untouched for so long that he is able to put his fist through a whole shelf full of books, reducing them to powder. George now realizes how repulsive this culture is: although they had no more war and hardship, they had also lost everything that made life worthwhile over the centuries - knowledge of science, mathematics, philosophy. He returns to the dome, voices his disgust and intends to return immediately to his own time. Weena looks at him as he leaves the dome.George returns to the stone building, and discovers to his horror that the time machine is gone! There are grooves in the dirt leading to the metal doors of the stone building. Apparently, someone or something dragged the machine inside. George is now trapped in the future. He picks up a rock and pounds on the doors, but they do not budge. Looking for another way in, George walks around the building and sees something moving in the bushes. It retreats when he lights a match. He sees another shape moving around, goes to check it and discovers that it is Weena! She had followed him to try to get him to come back to the dome. It was dangerous to be out at night. George asks Weena how to get inside the building behind them, and she says no one can get inside except the Morlocks. The Morlocks provide the Eloi with their food and clothing, but the Eloi must obey them. Eloi insists that they retreat to the safety of the dome, but George prefers to keep trying to get into the building, and he starts gathering wood for a fire to keep the dark at arm's length. She finds a wild flower, of a type unknown to George, and gives it to him.George begins to talk to Eloi about when he came from. Standing in front of the building, they are in the exact same place that George's house used to be eight hundred thousand years earlier. While he is talking, one of the shapes George saw earlier emerges from the bushes and grabs Weena. George runs after her and beats off the attacker, but doesn't get a good look at it. It was a Morlock. George gets the fire going, and Weena reaches out to it curiously; she has never even seen fire before. He tells her that she seems to have a few of the traits that had been largely lost, as she tried to help him by coming out of the dome. Yet she tells him that her people have also lost the concept of past and future. George thinks that he has landed in one of Man's many Dark Ages and wonders if he can help lead the people out.In the morning, George still could not open the doors to the stone building, but discoveries several artificial holes in a nearby field. He can dimly hear machines pounding on in the darkness below. Weena knows that they are another entrance to the Morlock world because some talking rings told her. George asks her to show him the rings, and she leads him back to another dusty museum area. There is a table with some rings, and George asks Weena for a demonstration. Weena spins a ring on the tabletop, which glows underneath the ring and a voice begins to speak - apparently, this is one of man's many later technologies that had been developed and then forgotten. The voices were old news reports. The ring spoke about the end of a 326-year war, which had ended only because so many people had been killed that there were not enough people left to fight and nothing left worth fighting with or for, resources had been depleted and pollution was rapidly killing off the survivors. George spins another ring, and this recorded voice is that of one of the last people to have a past. It described that some of the few stragglers left over from the war had gone underground to survive, and a few others had remained on the surface. George learned that those had gone underground became the Morlocks, who controlled the Eloi like cattle and took them in to an unknown fate periodically.Trailed by Weena, George returns to the field with the holes and begins to climb down a rusty ladder inside. Just then, a wailing sound begins and some rods emerge from the top of the stone building. It sounds just like the air-raid sirens during the wars. Weena appears to go into a trance and wanders off. George climbs back out of the hole to see what was going on, and sees scores of other Eloi walking like lemmings out of the dome, through the forest, towards the stone building. He can't get their attention, and he can't find Weena. Continuing through the forest, he spots her and grabs her, but she just looks blankly at him and continues walking. Closer to the building, the sounds of the siren are deafening. The metal doors to the building are wide open and the Eloi are walking through them into the building. George runs forward toward the building, but as quickly as it started, the wail of the siren ceases, the rods drop back into the building, and the metal doors close - with Weena inside and George out.The Eloi who had not yet reached the doors suddenly came out of their trance, like they had just been woken up, and start wandering away. But none of them know what happens inside the building. They only know that it is now ""all clear"" - a holdover from the old days. They only know to hide underground when the sirens go off. George tries to explain to them that all the wars, sirens, all clears, and the people who had participated in them were long dead, but they don't seem to understand anything except that it was now all clear, and they don't seem the least bit perturbed that people who enter the building are never seen again. Frustrated and determined to save Weena, George returns to the field with the holes and climbs down. The Eloi on the surface look down at him.Underground, George can hear the machinery, and finds some wood and tinder to make a torch, but doesn't light it yet. He explores the underground chambers and sees some of the machines. Some figures move around in the background - Morlocks - watching him, and he is aware that something is there but doesn't see them yet. Wandering into the next room, George sees human skeletons, and miscellaneous human bones sitting in bowls and on plates. It's a dining room, and he now sees that the Morlocks have turned cannibal and the Eloi who enter the building became dinner.George returns to the main underground room and explores a little more, then he sees a Morlock clearly for the first time -- they are short, squat beings with glowing eyes, drooping faces, long white hair and bluish-gray skin. It is driving the complacent Eloi with a whip in their walk to the slaughter. George spots Weena in line, and grabs her and removes her from the line and tries to wake her from her trance. A male Eloi wakes up and follows. George's cover has been blown and a Morlock attacks him from behind with the whip, and he drops his stick. George is able to wrest the whip from the Morlock's grasp and begins attacking it. Several more Morlocks joins the fray, and George must retreat.Remembering their fear of fire, George lights a match, and the Morlocks retreat, but the match goes out soon and they can advance again. One of the Morlocks tackles him while he is fumbling with the matches. He is able to escape and go over to where the stick landed. He tries to light it, but he's running out of matches. Weena runs over to him and gives him a piece of cloth torn from her dress to burn. George puts it on the end of the stick and lights it. While George keeps the Morlocks at bay with the torch, the Eloi start moving towards the stairs, but then he drops the torch and he is reduced to fighting with his fists. The Morlocks are not very effective in the melee, but there are a lot of them. Weena tries to grab the torch, but she is once again grabbed by a Morlock. George saves her once again, punching the Morlock repeatedly. Another Morlock charges him and this time seems to get the upper hand. One of the male Eloi, having just seen the fight, makes a fist for the first time in his life and imitates George, attacking the Morlock and knocking it out.George sees the torch guttering and there are more Morlocks still. He grabs it and sends the remaining Eloi up the stairs and follows them, protecting their rear from being followed. The Morlocks try to follow but they must keep a respectful distance from the fire. On his way up the stairs, George passes some flammable liquid and lights it with the torch. The Eloi find more Morlocks blocking their path going up the stairs, but they are able to knock them off the stairs into the fire. Soon the fire spreads to the machines on the floor. The Eloi reach the bottom of the ladders and begin to climb out of the holes, which are already belching smoke. Urged by George, they gather up more dead branches and drop them down into the holes to add fuel to the fire. There is a secondary explosion and one of the walls around the holes falls in. George and the Eloi run to the river, and then there are more explosions underground and the entire chamber and the ground on top collapses into the hole.The Morlock underworld and the danger it presented had been destroyed, but so too was the shiftless lifestyle of the Eloi as livestock. Yet George was still trapped. He talks to Weena again, and she asks him if he is unhappy that he has to stay where he is. He still wants to return home and tell his own people what he learned. He realizes he doesn't fit in in the future. Weena is interested in seeing George's time and wonders if he has any girl-friends there. He doesn't, but he has his male friends, and his 62-year-old maid. Weena obviously likes him. Their chat is interrupted by the other Eloi, who race into the clearing to draw their attention to the stone building. It too is in flames, and the doors are wide open. The time machine is just inside. George is overcome with joy and pulls the glass-handled control stick out of his pocket. He runs forward to the machine and calls for Weena to join him, intending to take her home with him. But once he is inside, the doors close again with a metallic ""bong!"" and he can't open them from the inside, either. Worse, a few surviving Morlocks are coming up the stairs out of the conflagration below. George climbs into the machine but still has to beat off the remaining Morlocks as he gets the machine started. He continues forward, into the future, and watches the dead Morlock on the floor rot to a skeleton and then to dust. Realizing that he's been about as far into the future as he cares to see, he reverses the direction of the control stick, sending the time machine hurtling back into the past. Exhausted, he leans back in the machine as the time passes in reverse rapidly backwards. He slows the machine as it finally reaches the early twentieth century, finally bringing it to a stop on January 5, 1900, the night he'd invited his friends over to dinner. He's back when he started - the only difference is he and his machine are outside in the garden now, instead of in the laboratory where he left. He has to break into his own house just as a distant clock tower chimes 8 p.m. Battered from his fights with the Morlocks, he stumbles into his house to greet his guests.After he has finished telling them his story, it's after 9 p.m., and his friends still don't believe him. They think he's a great storyteller, though. George doesn't know how to make them understand, but he reaches into his pocket and finds the flower that Weena gave him. Handing it to David Filby, he challenges him to match it to any species known in the present day and tell him how he obtained it in such condition in the middle of winter. He is stumped.His friends get ready to leave, telling George he appears exhausted, as he no doubt is. As before, Filby lingers to talk to him. George makes his goodbyes to him, and they sound final, as if he suspects he might not see him again. Filby talks to the other men in the carriage, and he sounds like he almost believes the story himself. Then as the carriage drives off, Filby returns to the house to check on George. George is dragging the time machine through the falling snow back into the laboratory. While Filby is looking for George, he hears the time machine being revved up. He reaches the laboratory with Mrs. Watchett but not in time to see George disappear bound for the future once more. However, he does see the open doors and the tracks made by the time machine's brass runners.Suddenly, Filby realizes that it's true as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. George had built his time machine in the laboratory, and it traveled through time but not through space. When he had returned home, it appeared in the garden, but this was only because the Morlocks had moved it a few dozen yards into their building in the far future. The patch of ground occupied by the laboratory would eventually be just outside the stone building, and the place where the garden was would be just inside it eight hundred thousand years in the future. George had dragged the machine back to its original location so that when he returned to the future, he would be outside the building and those impenetrable doors, outside, in the last place he had seen Weena.Returning to the parlor, Filby realizes that George would probably have taken something with him if he intended to help the Eloi rebuild their culture, and sure enough, three books are missing from the shelves. They don't know which books. Filby and Mrs. Watchett wonder if George will ever return, and if so, when, but Filby realizes that George has, quite literally, all the time in the world. He leaves, and Mrs. Watchett turns out the lights."

Over 200 years after being executed for being a witch and a vampire, Princess Asa Vajda is resurrected when two travelers, Prof. Thomas Kruvajan and Dr. Andre Gorobec, accidentally disturb her abandoned tomb. At the time of her execution, the princess swore vengeance against her accuser, her brother, and all of his descendants. She quickly resurrects her lover and turns Kruvajan into her vampire servant. When she learns that the present day Princess Katia is identical to her, she sets out to get control of the young woman.—garykmcd 17th century Moldavia. As the hungry, cleansing flames consume her body, malicious Princess Asa places an irrevocable curse on her Grand Inquisitor brother and the entire House of Vajda. However, nothing can stand in hell's way, and two centuries later, two rational men of science inadvertently reawaken the cursed witch. As mistress of evil Asa and her wicked accomplice Javutich pick up where they left off, black infernal fury awaits the unsuspecting descendants of their executors. Now, the mesmerising eyes of the demon deceive her innocent victims. Who can break the spell of Satan?—Nick Riganas In 1630 Russia, Princess Asa (Barbara Steele), a beautiful, dark-haired, young woman is condemned for practicing witchcraft. The grand inquisitor is none other then her estranged brother, Prince Vajda, who renounces his ties to his sister. As the executioner ties her down to the stake, Asa defiantly swears retribution by returning from the dead one day. The executioner positions a spike-lined metal mask over her face. On her brother's command, a swift hammer blow drives the mask into her skull, killing her instantly. She is then interred in the family crypt in a coffin equipped with a window, thought which the sign of the cross is visible. With the cross forever visible to her lifeless body, it is said that the witch will never return to life.200 years later, Doctors Kruvejan (Andrea Checchi) and Gorovek (John Richardson) are riding in a carriage from St. Petersburg to Moscow on their way to a medical conference. A wheel on the carriage slips out of its socket. Leaving the driver to repair the damage, the pair decide to investigate an old ruined chapel nearby, where they discover the witch's coffin in the crypt below. Kruvejan is suddenly attacked by a large bat, and when he beats it to death in his cane, he accidentally smashes the stone cross position over the window. The fragments from the cross smash the glass, enabling Kruvejan to pull away the witch's mask. Her face is sunken and decayed, but is otherwise intact. Gorovek convinces his friend to leave before the driver becomes overly anxious, but unbeknownst to both, blood from a small cut on Kruvejans hand is already working to revive Asa.Outside the chapel, the two doctors are startled by Princess Katia (Barbara Steele in a dual role), the daughter of Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani). Gorovek is immediately smitten with her. The sad, seemingly fixed expression she wears tells of an unhappy nature, which is bourn out by her saying that the chapel is her father's property and he refuses to fix it up.The men continue their journey, stopping for the night at a small inn not far from the Vaja estate. Meanwhile in the castle, Prince Vajda is uneasy. He reminds her servant Ivan (Tino Bianchi), that this day marks the 200th anniversary of Asas execution. On this same day, every 100 years, mysterious events have happened in the area and the nearby village. The prince fears for Katia's safety, particularly since her resemblance to Asa seems to mark her for a very special fate. Ivan puts his master at ease, reminding him that so long as he wears a cross, no harm can befall him.In the crypt, the witch completes her resurrection. Using her special powers, she calls her lover, the vampire Javutich (Arturo Dominici) from his grave in the village cemetery. The vampire slowly crawls out of the earth and proceeds to act on Asa's instructions. Javutich arrives at the inn and fetches Dr. Kruvejan, claiming that the prince has called for a physician. Upon arrival at the castle, the doctor is led to a downstairs chamber. To Kruvejans astonishment, the chamber leads directly to the old crypt, where he is locked in. Kruvejans fear turns to hysteria when Asa emerges from her coffin and calls out to him. She places him under her power saying that a few drops of his blood brought her back to life. All of it will give her the strength to accomplice her vengeance. She bites him on the neck and begins to feed off his blood.Back at the castle, the prince sleeps fitfully. He is awakened by the intrusion of Javutich, who makes his way slowly to the old mans bed. The prince wakes up and is saved by the crucifix necklace he has around his neck. As Javutich retreats, Katia and her older brother Constantine (Enrico Oliveri) arrive in the bedroom responding the princes cries. But when he tells them about an intruder, Katia and Constantine think his delirious and send out for a doctor. It is Kruvejan who arrives to help him. The doctor's appearance is changed for his hair is grayer, and expression and attitude much crueler. Kruvejan successfully puts the prince into a deep sleep with some sedatives, and persuades Katia and Constantine to go to bed for the night, but persuades them to remove the crucifix from the prince's neck. Afterwards, Kruvejan reenters the prince's bedroom, and kills the old man by biting his neck and feeding on his blood.The next morning, Katia and Constantine are grief-stricken when they find their father dead. Finding that Kruvejan has disappeared, they send out for Gorovek. Yet Prince Vajda is not the only person to die mysteriously. That same morning, some village children find the dead body of one of the prince's servants on a river bank. When local people soon learn about this, they become convinced that the witch has finally returned from the grave.Meanwhile, Gorovek is amazed to learn that Kruvejan has disappeared, and refuses to believe that he would have willingly left a sick man unattended. Together with Constantine, he sets out to discover the truth. At the same time, his infatuation with Katia blooms into a full-blown romance.In the village, talk begins to circulate about the return of the witch Asa and her vampire lover. Gorovek becomes intrigued by the talk and seeks the aid of the parish priest, who assures the young man that such creatures do exist. Gorovek and the priest go to the old cemetery where Javutich is reputed to be buried, only to discover his half-buried coffin, and Kruvejan lying asleep in it. The priest slays Kruvejan by driving a wooden stake into his right eye. Gorovek hurries back to the castle to see if Katia is all right.At the castle, Javutich murders both Ivan, and then Constantine with little difficulty, leaving Katia all alone in the castle. When the princess goes to visit her father's coffin in their living room, the prince rises up from it as a vampire and advances towards her. But Javutich shows up and hurls the undead prince into the fireplace where he burns to death. Javutich then grabs Katia and takes her down into the crypt where Asa is waiting for them. Asa is still very weak and in need of more blood, grabs Katia and begins to feed off her. It is Asa's intention to murder Katia and to assume her identity in the process.Gorovek finally arrives at the castle and immediately engages in a drawn-out fight with Javuitch. Eventually the doctor dispatches the vampire the throwing him though a trap door in the floor of the path to the crypt and the vampire lands on wooden stakes at the bottom. Gorovek makes his way into the crypt, interrupting Asas rejuvenation. However, he believes the witch's claims that Katia, who is lying unconscious on the coffin, is the witch because of her pail appearance by her loss of blood. As Gorvoek prepares to drive a wooden stake into her heart, he suddenly notices that the 'witch' is wearing Katia's crucifix necklace, something impossible for an evil entity to wear a holy symbol. Immediately, Gorovek turns to Asa and tears away at her robe, revealing that her body, still undeveloped, is a putrid mass of flesh and exposed bone. Just then the priest arrives with a mob of townsfolk where they grab Asa, and they finally put the witch to death by tying her to a stake, setting it afire and she finally burns to death. As the witch finally dies, Katia arises with her life energy restored."
Pollyanna,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054195/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young girl comes to an embittered town and confronts its attitude with her determination to see the best in life. A little girl comes to a town that is embattled by feuds and intimidated by her aunt. By the time she must leave, she has transformed the community with her indominatable will to see the good side of even the worst situations and bring it out for the betterment of all.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> It's the early twentieth century. Preteen Pollyanna Whittier (Hayley Mills) has led a simple life as part of a church family, her parents former missionaries, with her father now a minister. Following the deaths of her parents, Pollyanna is sent to live with her wealthy maternal spinster aunt, Polly Harrington (Jane Wyman), in the town of Harrington, founded by the Harrington family. Pollyanna had never met her aunt before arriving in Harrington. Polly feels an obligation to the family name, and as such controls almost every aspect of what happens in town, which she is able to do as a Harrington company has dealings with almost every other company and person in town, she not afraid to wield that clout if anyone goes against her, especially Mayor Karl Warren (Donald Crisp). In that control, she will not allow her personal assistant/one of her maids, Nancy Furman (Nancy Olson), to be seen in public with her beau, George Dodds (James Drury), as Polly believes such behavior is disrespectful to her as Nancy's employer. Polly even controls the church as Reverend Paul Ford (Karl Malden) vets his sermons through her, they always, on Polly's directive, of a fire and brimstone nature. She also took in Pollyanna solely out of obligation rather than out of kindness or love. The town orphanage, the building for which Polly's father donated to the town, is in major disrepair. Polly would rather pay money out of her own pocket to make whatever band-aid repairs to the building than to embark on a community project to raise funds for a new orphanage solely as the building has the Harrington name. As opposed to Polly's stern outlook, Pollyanna, based on the teachings of her father, tries to find the good in everything and everyone. These someones include perhaps the two most disliked people in town, recluse Mr. Pendergast (Adolphe Menjou), the town's children believing he having other children who have trespassed on his property imprisoned in his basement, and disagreeable Mrs. Snow (Agnes Moorehead), who thinks more about dying than living. But the toughest nut for Pollyanna to crack may be her Aunt Polly, with her singular focus on control over the town to her standards and morals. Pollyanna may get some help in the matter of her aunt by Mayor Warren's nephew, Dr. Edmond Chilton (Richard Egan), a former resident who now lives in Baltimore, who is back in town for the first time in five years on a vacation, and who was once Polly's beau.—Huggo Even after having lived the hardscrabble life of a missionary's daughter all her life and seen the loss of both parents, young Pollyanna Whittier (Hayley Mills) refuses to be depressed. Instead, she must be glad about anything she can think of, and it's paid off big time. Now, however, she must go to live with her cold, spinsterish Aunt Polly Harrington (Jane Wyman) in a town inhibited by embittered, unfriendly souls. Can she use her glad game to win over everyone and transform the town?"

But soon, the local Dr. Willers and Gordon realizes that every woman in the village of childbearing age is pregnant. Anthea and the other women deliver perfect children and soon Dr. Willers note that all the children have strange eyes, short fingernails and different blond hair.

Their son David is born normally, as are the other children, but all of them have strange glowing eyes. By the age of 1 David shows shows a high level of intelligence, opening a complex puzzle box. The other children born at the same time exhibit the same traits. They also appear to have a shared consciousness or the ability to communicate telepathically. As the children age the authorities grow increasingly wary of their powers but Gordon Zillaby gets permission to study them for a year. It quickly becomes apparent that the children are seeking to control everything forcing Gordon to take action.—garykmcd After a series of establishing shots of a village in rural England, we switch to a study where Gordon Zelleby (George Sanders) is making arrangements by phone with his brother-in-law, Alan Bernard (Michael Gwynn) to come down for the day. In mid-sentence Gordon collapses to the floor.All through the town people have collapsed or passed out. Cars crash, phones ring unanswered. The local bell tower shows 10 minutes to 11.Alan, who an officer in the British army, reports to his superior that something strange seems to have happened in the village of Midwich, he asks permission to leave early. He wonders if the exercises the 4th Brigade are doing in the area could be responsible.Driving to the town, Berrnard encounters a local police officer Gobby, (Peter Vaughan) who is investigating the non appearance of a scheduled bus from Midwich. Rounding the next bend in the road the find the vehicle crashed in a ditch.Gobby investigates but passes out just like the people in the village. Bernard realizes something is terribly wrong and heads to the previous town to report to his commanding officer. The alarm is immediately raised and local area commanders are ordered to seal off the town and surrounding areas.Unsure what they are dealing with, soldiers are ordered forward carrying caged canaries attached to poles. When the birds pass out, the spot is marked. It is quickly noted the creatures return to life as soon as the cage is retrieved.At the site of the bus crash the army sends a volunteer in to the affected area. He is wearing a gas mask and tethered by rope so that if he collapses he can be pulled to safety. As they begin Dr Willers (Laurence Naismith) the local Midwich doctor arrives on his way back to the town.The soldier collapses as expected and is pulled to safety. Examination by Willers shows no obvious cause, and the man revives under his own power. Other than feeling intensely cold the solider reports he is perfectly fine.The army then sends a plane to overfly the town. The pilot reports nothing unusual other than absolutely nothing is moving in the area. The pilot takes his craft lower only to black out and crash in a nearby field.The military are considering their options when suddenly all the people in the bus and officer Gobby revive. We see images from all over town of people regaining consciousness and trying to understand what happened to them. In his study Gordon wakes as his wife Anthea Zellaby (Barbara Shelley) chides him for letting her sleep so late, she then comments its nearly 3 p.m.Gordon apologies that he also fell asleep, but given he woke on the floor of the study, he may have passed out. Discussing how they feel, the couple agrees they feel intensely cold and Gordon complains he can't feel his hands.Bernard arrives at the house and is pleased to see the couple are okay, he goes on to explain the events of the last four hours and Midwich was surrounded by some barrier that cut it off from the world.Through the rest of the day, military units pour into the town. The local townsfolk are subject to a battery of tests by specialists and the town is examined inch by inch for any unusual readings or signs of activity.Later, Gordon is invited to London by Bernard to take part in a meeting to review what occurred in the town. No direct after affect or cause for the phenomena has been discovered. This leads Gordon to be concerned about how they will identify long term effects if they can't understand the situation that caused it. Bernard suggests Gordon be put in charge of monitoring the towns population. The obvious solution would be to hospitalize them but this would create huge disruptions and potentially alert the press.Later, Anthea announces to Gordon that she is expecting a baby. Gordon is flustered but overjoyed by the news. Although Anthea is young, Gordon married quite late in life and never really expected the opportunity to raise children. At Doctor Willer's office, Milly Hughes (Pamela Buck) is devastated to find out she is also pregnant. Milly is distraught because she is still a virgin. Dr. Willers comforts her, but clearly he does not believe her.Tension is high in another household. Mrs. Pawle has just told her husband she is pregnant even though he's only just returned from a full year at sea.Concerned by the sudden rash of pregnancies, Doctor Willers and Gordon meet with the town vicar (Bernard Archard). An attempted suicide has been reported and the two men want to see what information the vicar might have, especially if any of the girls had confessed to the priest who the father might be. The Vicar has heard nothing from either Mrs Pawle or Milly, but is aware of three further girls who are also expecting. He is deeply troubled that one girl is only 15 years old.
.
As three men compare the information they have, Dr Willers realizes that every woman of child-bearing age is the town expecting, and that all the pregnancies date from the day of the strange events.Five months later, the pregnancies are going well, too well according to Dr Willers. Each fetus appears to be at the 7th month of development even though the women are only in their fifth month. Anthea becomes depressed over the baby. She wants to know whose baby she is carrying, what sort of monster or strange child she is going to bring into the world. Gordon comforts her with the thought; all they can do is wait.The village becomes pensive and nervous as all the women go into labor at the same time. One of the first born, Anthea's child, is healthy 10-pounder, but the doctor in bothered by the child's strange eyes. We then learn that a total of 12 babies are born, all weighing a touch over 10 pounds and all with strange eyes.Four months later, the doctor examines some hair taken from Gordon's son, David. Aside from their odd fingernails and strange eyes, the children seem perfectly normal except that they have the developmental level of 18-month-old children.Upstairs in the Zellaby nursery a commotion breaks out. Anthea is in a state of panic and puts her hand in a pot of boiling water, burning it badly. It seems she forgot to test the child's milk and it was too hot for him.A year passes. David, now a toddler, spells out his name with blocks. As a test, Gordon then gives him a Chinese box puzzle. He works through the puzzle and opens it with alarming speed. Gordon then goes to a neighbor's home and tests their child; it opens the device without hesitation.A third child is tested but his older brother steals the puzzle. The child's eyes light with a strange glow, and the older boy falls into a trance and meekly returns the stolen puzzle.Years pass, and the children become inseparable and deal with the taunting from other children as a combined group. It is now becoming apparent that they can read minds.It is three years since the children were born, and Gordon is summoned to London for a special conference to discuss the children. Alan is becoming disturbed at Gordon's intellectual detachment from the issue of the strange behavior of the children. Gordon believes (unlike others in the village) that the children are not evil or bad, but just need to have morals instilled in them.In London, it is revealed that Midwich was not the only town that has experienced this phenomenon. In Australia, something went wrong and all the children died within 10 hours of birth. In Greenland and Mongolia, the children were killed at birth by frightened members of the community. One other group, born in the Soviet Union, is thriving and receiving the best of educations.Present at the meeting, Dr Carile suggests that the children may be a naturally occurring evolutionary jump. Others such as Professor Smith disagree and believe the children may be the product of an energy beam directed to Earth by some unknown intelligence.News comes through that a child has drowned in Midwich after having an altercation with the strange children, and they are being blamed for the event. George continues to defend them, arguing they need studying. They seem connected by a hive mind, and if humanity could control that, it was advance intelligence by a factor of 12.
To keep better control of the children, Zellaby suggests that they be kept together under one roof at Midwich's school. He offers to run the project and continue studying them for another 12 months while the government decides the best course of actions.Back in Midwich, Zellaby begins teaching the children. They now openingly admit that they can read thoughts at the front of his mind, but have not mastered the complete understanding of everything he is thinking. Deciding to test Dr Smith's theory, he asks the children about life on other planets. The children go into a communal trance and refuse to answer Gordon's question. He rephrases the question but the children still refuse to answer. Gordon then asks David what he intends to do with the powers the children are developing. David tells Gordon he knows what Gordon is really trying to find out and it would be better if these types of questions were not asked. David says they are here to learn from him.Later, Mrs Zellaby witnesses one of the special girls nearly killed by a car. The driver jumps out, fretting that he may have hurt the girl. Some of the other special children who witnessed the incident begin to gather around the driver. The man seems to slip into a trance, returns to his car and drives it without hesitation into a wall, being killed on impact.At an inquest into the accident, Mrs Zellaby is called as a witness. Her testimony is confused and lacking detail, as if she is trying to remember something but can't. Ultimately they court records a verdict of accidental death.On a country road, the brother of the man killed tries to ambush the children. Gordon talks him out of the attempt, but before he can leave he is spotted by the children. They put him into the same trance his brother fell into and fatally shoots himself with his own gun.Zellaby now understands how deep the situation is. He'd hoped to communicate with them, but clearly the process is breaking down. He realizes they need to somehow be stopped before they expand their power beyond the village. Zellaby and Bernard are discussing the best course of action when news comes through from Russia. The other surviving colony has been destroyed by an atomic shell fired from 60 miles away. The entire population, including the children, has been killed.Back at Midwich, the panicked villagers decide they need to do something about the children. The men form a mob and, armed with farm implements and flaming torches, advance on the school house with the intention of burning it down and trapping the children inside. David goes outside to confront the advancing villagers. David then puts the man in a tell take trance and forces him to set fire to himself, only releasing him from his control when the man is close to death.Bernard witnesses the failed attack and enters the school to confront David, who is aware of the Russian colony's fate. David warns Bernard that an attack on this colony won't succeed. When Bernard asks why, the boy responds, ""This group MUST survive.""David then takes control of Bernard and reinforces a message that the children just want to be left alone; they drive that into him before releasing him. Later, Bernard is examined by Dr Willers who believes Bernard is suffering the worst case of shock he's ever seen.David arrives at the house and confronts his father. He tells the man the children have decided to leave the village and spread out across the country. Their power has reached a point where each child can found a new colony. David then outlines a series of travel arrangements he wants Gordon to organize to help the children disperse.Gordon comes up with a plan to get through to the children; sensing Anthea's fear, he arranges for her to travel back to London with Alan. As Alan says goodbye, Gordon seems very introspective and on the verge of crying.
Now alone in the house, we understand Gordon's emotions. He is building a bomb he hopes will destroy the children if he can keep his mind blank enough to avoid detetection. He begins to practice imagining a brick wall in his mind to help build a mental barrier that the children can't penetrate.On the drive to London, Anthea realizes something is wrong, and insists on returning to Midwich to try and stop Gordon from doing whatever he's planned.Gordon arrives at the school, and David senses immediately that he is nervous and ill at ease. The children try to break down his mental defense of the brick wall. Gordon holds out long enough to avoid any chance of the children escaping. At the last second, Gordon's mind collapses and the children realize he's been hiding a bomb.Anthea arrives at the school just as an explosion rips through the building. She immediately understands the implications of Gordon's sacrifice in killing the children and himself.Chapman_glen@yahoo.com"

Tom Ripley is sent to Europe by Mr. Greenleaf to fetch his spoiled, playboy son, Philippe, and bring him back home to the States. In return, Tom will receive $5,000. Philippe toys with Tom, pretending he will go back home, but has no intentions of leaving his bride to be, Marge, and honoring his father's wishes. After some time passes, Mr. Greenleaf considers the mission a failure and cuts Tom off. However, he will need all his conman abilities to keep afloat.—Humberto Amador/Peter Brandt Nielsen Tom Ripley and Philippe Greenleaf are lately inseparable friends. They're both idling in Europe, but on papa Greenleaf's dime. Philippe's fiancée Marge feels sorry for Tom but resents his presence, while Philippe's other friend, Freddie, considers Tom Ripley a worthless moocher.

Spurlin In this filmed version of Patricia Highsmith's novel, The Talented Mr Ripley, with no money off his own, amoral Thomas Ripley (played by a too-beautiful Alain Delon) feels he feels he should live the luxurious life which he's entitled to.

However, both Philippe and his beautiful girlfriend, Marge, have no intention of renouncing the dolce vita, and as the couple sails toward Sicily accompanied by Tom, it soon becomes evident that three is a crowd. Now, greed, envy, and lust are starting to take over, and there is more to Tom than meets the eye. To what extremes can one go to get a slice of luxury? Above all, who can hide the truth under the blazing sun?—Nick Riganas In Rome, we see Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) and Tom Ripley (Alain Delon) at a cafe table together; Tom is writing postcards. They chat about Philippe's girlfriend Marge, who he is having trouble with. Philippe gets up when he sees his friend Freddy (Billy Kearns) and invites him to join them. When Tom is away at a bookstore Philippe tells Freddy that Tom has admitted that it was Philippe's father who had Tom go to Italy to bring Philippe home to America with the promise of a handsome reward. Philippe has no intention of going. Freddy is uneasy about Tom and soon leaves; Philippe has Tom pick up their tab. As they walk down the street Philippe bumps into a blind man. He gives him money, then on Tom's suggestion buys the blind man's cane and gives him money for the taxi home. When Philippe pretends to be blind and stumbles into a car, a young woman takes pity on him and guides him across the street, and she ends up spending the evening with both men in a horse carriage, only later discovering that Philippe is not blind. Full of laughter, she buys the cane and has the carriage stop so she can try walking like a blind woman; she asks them to wait for her, but they instead proceed to a night club. Meanwhile Tom has seen fit to steal some of the lady's jewelry.Next, Philippe and Tom arrive by boat in the coastal town of Mongibello, where Philippe lives. At a local ballet company pre-premiere nerves are on; we see Philippe and Tom bring back a drunken man, O'Brien (Frank Latimore), the company director. Then they pay a visit to the guitar-playing, Fra Angelico-studying Marge (Marie Laforêt), who is upset with Philippe for leaving town for several days. They soon make up on the sofa, while Tom goes to the next room, discovers some of Philippe's clothes and puts them on. He looks into the mirror and pretends to be Philippe, but is interrupted by Philippe at the door. Later when Philippe is on his way to the bank for a cash withdrawal, Tom comes to him with a letter from Philippe's father, who is disappointed that Philippe does not seem intent on returning home and consequently discontinues his financial arrangement with Tom. Tom seems haunted and begs Philippe to go to San Francisco so he can get his hands on his father's money.Philippe, Marge and Tom go on a sail boat to join Freddy at Taormina. It's high summer, the sun is hot and the ocean is blue. During a meal Tom talks about how he used to adore Philippe when they were kids, and how Philippe's father didn't want them to be together because Tom wasn't of good enough family. Philippe sends Tom to the steering wheel while he and Marge have some time alone, but Tom overhears Philippe saying to Marge that he is not fond of Tom and that they will soon leave him behind so they can be alone. Tom is upset and deliberately makes the boat shake. Philippe comes up and, faking concern for the boat, tricks Tom into the safety boat, which he lets float after the ship, and retires to the cabin. But the rope breaks, and Tom drifts off. When Philippe discovers this he sets out to find Tom, and he and Marge bring the sunburned Tom aboard again. When Marge blames Philippe for treating his friend in this way he says that in fact he and Tom never spent their childhood together. When Philippe looks for a shirt among Tom's things he discovers some of his own bank statements hidden, though he keeps his discovery from Marge. Marge asks Tom to leave them behind and go home when they reach land.One night, we see Tom hide the earrings he stole earlier in the pocket of some of Philippe's clothes. The next day the two men have a conversation about the bank statements, and Philippe guesses that it might have been Tom's intention to pretend to be Philippe and claim his money as his own. Philippe and Marge have a row involving the earrings Marge has found among Philippe's clothes, and when Philippe tosses her Fra Angelico writings into the ocean she demands to be set ashore. Philippe and Tom continue alone.

A police officer, Riccordi (Erno Crisa), comes to Tom's pension to question him about the murder in which Mr. Greenleaf is a suspect, but Tom is, of course, unable to help.The next day Tom is present at the morgue to identify Freddy's body, along with Marge and others. They go to a restaurant and discuss Philippe's whereabouts, though they all believe him to be innocent.

Teacher B.T. Cates is arrested for teaching Darwin's theories. Famous lawyer Henry Drummond defends him; fundamentalist politician Matthew Brady prosecutes.

Hornbeck (played by Gene Kelly), arranges to bring in renowned defense attorney and atheist Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) to defend Cates. The prosecutor, Matthew Brady (played by Fredric March ) is a former presidential candidate and famous evangelist. The two are old adversaries and clash throughout the film. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Cates's girlfriend is the daughter of the town's bombastic preacher (Claude Akins).Throughout the movie, the sarcastic reporter mocks the bible toting hostile townsfolk. Drummond eventually calls the prosecutor to the stand and prods him to explain various biblical stories such as Jonah and the whale. Eventually, the great Biblical Literalist is forced to concede that certain Biblical accounts cannot be taken literally, but must be interpreted intellectually. With that concession, Drummond is able to assert Cates has every right to hold a differing opinion, including about the Book of Genesis and to deny him that right is unjust.Matthew Brady is so rattled by Drummond's questioning that he collapses under the strain. In the end, despite his badgering of Brady, Drummond is sympathetic to his beliefs. The judge (Henry Morgan) issues a $100.00 fine much to the dismay of many in the courtroom."

Things take another humorous turn when a drunken TV cannot resist stage entertainer Lola (Barbara Nichols), who performs underwater acrobatic tricks in a large tank. When TV jumps in the tank with Lola, Tuggle, knowing TV cannot swim, jumps in after him. Soon Merritt, Angie, Ryder and Basil have fallen in the tank attempting to save one another. The police soon arrive and arrest everyone.At the police station, after the police chief (Chill Wills) dismiss the restaurants charges against them, the group have a beach party, where TV is once again seduced by Lola's dancing.

As Melanie, Ryder and Tuggle drive in Ryder's car towards the motel in nearby Silver Beach from which Melanie has phoned, they see her wandering on the traffic-filled road (clearly attempting suicide) where she is sideswiped by a car.

After giving his statement to a policeman, Ryder leaves the hospital dejected.Alone with Merritt, Melanie laments her mistake and caustically says the boys were not even ""Yalies,"" (both Dill and Franklin having lied to Melanie about attending Yale) l prompting Merritt to cry in shame.

He claims that he was faithful and nothing happened between him and Lola.The next day TV, Basil, Angie and Tuggle leave for home, while Merritt remains to care for Melanie until she can return to her parents. As she wonders the now deserted Fort Lauderdale beach alone, Merritt runs into Ryder once again where they talk about the other night and she finally doubts her own resolve about chastity, but Ryder assures her that she is too strong to succumb. Merritt responds that no girl is strong in the face of what she thinks is love. When they both cautiously offer that they might be in love, Ryder asks her to come to his Brown graduation and continue their relationship. They kiss and walk off down the beach together.The End"
The Lost World,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054038/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Professor Challenger leads an expedition of scientists and adventurers to a remote plateau deep in the Amazonian jungle to verify his claim that dinosaurs still live there. Professor Challenger leads team of scientists and adventurers to a remote plateau deep within the Amazonian jungle to investigate reports that dinosaurs still live there.—Marg Baskin <marg@asd.raytheon.ca> The boisterous, arrogant professor Challenger, a reputed biologist and anthropologist, dares the London Zoological Society to mount an expedition to verify his spectacular claim, without physical proof, that his previous expedition to the Amazonian basin found live dinosaurs. Apart from him and his 'socialite' counterpart, professor Summerlee, it consists of experienced discoverer Lord Roxbury, the young reporter Ed Malone -who got publicly struck down with Challenger's umbrella at his arrival- and Jennifer Holmes, Malone's news agency's boss's daughter, essentially as conditions for putting up the money. In Brazil they are joined by Jennifer's brother David and local 'guide' Manuel Gomez. They soon discover the dinosaurs are real and dangerous, like giant spiders, but loose their helicopter and thus are desperate for a way down from the isolated plateau. They learn Roxbury knew about the fate of Burton White, an explorer whose diary they find, thus presume to be dead, in search of diamonds, and confirmation of the local tribe being the lethal guardians of the plateau's secrets, but also get surprising help...—KGF Vissers Professor George Edward Challenger leads an expedition to a mysterious South American plateau where he claims to have seen Jurassic-age dinosaurs. He is accompanied by one of his fiercest critics Professor Summerlee, eminent hunter and explorer Lord John Roxton and journalist Ed Malone, whose newspaper is financing the expedition. Once in South America, they are joined by socialite Jennifer Holmes and her brother David who have simply decided to invite themselves along. They are flown to the top of the plateau by helicopter pilot Manuel Gomez but soon after their arrival the helicopter is destroyed by a large prehistoric creature. When they are taken prisoner by natives, they will not only have to escape but find a way down from the plateau.—garykmcd Professor Challenger, a celebrated biologist and anthropologist, reports to the London Zoological Society that he has discovered living specimens of supposedly extinct animals, including dinosaurs, on an expedition to the Amazon Basin and up a barely known plateau. He challenges the Society to sponsor a second expedition to the plateau. Much to Challenger's dismay, he attracts a few very unscientific people to join him on his second journey to the Amazon. This expedition group includes big-game hunter Lord John Roxton, and newsman Ed Malone whose publisher advances $100,000 to pay for the expedition. The publisher's adventurous daughter Jennifer and son David join the group at the head of the Amazon. Also in the group is Zoological Society bigwig Professor Summerlee, helicopter pilot Manuel Gomez, and his sidekick Jose Costa. During the first night on the plateau, a dinosaur wrecks the helicopter. As the expedition proceeds, Malone chases a primitive jungle girl through cobwebs to a giant spider, killing it and bringing her back to camp. The native girl later falls for David. Roxton argues with the others, and jealousies over Jennifer lead to a fistfight between Malone and Roxton. They discover the diary of a previous explorer, Burton White, who was lost on the plateau. Roxton is mentioned several times in the diary. Roxton reveals that he had visited the plateau three years before, and claims the plateau holds a bounty of diamonds. This motivates Jose to stay with the party instead of striking out on his own to escape from the plateau. At one point, Malone and Jennifer are separated from the others and have a near-death encounter with two battling dinosaurs. Cannibals capture the party, but before they can become dinner the jungle girl leads them to an underground passage that leads down off the plateau. Along the way, they encounter Burton White, now living as a blind hermit (The cannibals have a taboo against killing the blind). They encounter more obstacles - pursuit by the cannibals, spider plants, the ""Graveyard of the Damned,"" and a dinosaur in a lava pit guarding the diamonds, which kills Costa. Gomez sacrifices himself while breaking a rock dam, killing the dinosaur. During a volcanic eruption, the survivors of the Challenger party escape from the plateau, Challenger carrying the egg of a Tyrannosaurus rex. The financial security of the party is secure because Lord Roxton filled a couple of the bellows pockets of his hunting jacket with diamonds, and shares them with everyone. The dinosaur egg hatches when it is dropped by accident, and Professor Challenger decides to take the infant T. Rex back to London with them. The 1960 version based on the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novel opens with title and credits shown over various scenes of lava flowing. A Boing 707 in TWA livery lands at London Airport. A newscaster is there to welcome Professor George Edward Challenger (Claude Rains). A crowd of newspaper reporters crowd the stairway of the airplane clamoring for an interview. Front and center is Ed Malone (David Hedison). Challenger makes himself clear, ""Anything I have to say about the expedition will be said tonight at the Institute, and not before."" Challenger bops Malone on the head with his umbrella, sending the man crashing to the tarmac below. A small dog, Frosty, climbs up on Malone. Jennifer Holmes (Jill St. John) comes to fetch her dog and explains how she will be attending the professor's lecture. She introduces herself. She is the daughter of Malone's boss. Of course, Ed Malone made the newspaper headlines, ""Challenger Assaults London newsman.""At the Zoological Institute in London, a crowd gathers. Challenger enters smoking a cigar. He greets Prof. Summerlee (Richard Haydn) who shows his distain by fanning the cigar smoke away from his face. Jennifer enters with Lord John Roxton (Michael Rennie). They take their seats in the front row as the meeting is called to order. Ed Malone is already seated in the front row. Summerlee introduces Challenger and explains that Challenger has returned from the headwaters of the Amazon River with a report, ""That he insists will turn the scientific world topsie-turvey."" Challenger tells the audience that on a plateau in Brazil he has found plant and animal creatures from prehistoric times, ""Live Dinosaurs."" The audience murmurs disbelief, and one gentleman in the audience calls Challenger a liar. Unfortunately for Challenger, on his way down the river, the boat overturned and all his evidence and equipment was lost. Challenger proposes another expedition, not to leave later than a month from now and demands that Sommerlee and two others attend. Roxton volunteers and both Challenger and Summerlee agree. Jennifer volunteers, but Challenger flatly states, ""There will be no women on my expedition."" Ed Malone volunteers, and of course Challenger objects. Stuart Holmes (an uncredited John Graham), the executive VP of Global News, enters the hall and agrees to finance the expedition to the tune of $100,000, but only if Malone accompanies the professor on the expedition. Challenger agrees, noting, ""Since I was never a man to resist logic, or cash, I shall ignore my personal feelings and approve Mr. Malone as a member of the expedition."" Summerlee reluctantly agrees to both Roxton and Malone. Roxton and Jennifer depart. Malone writes several articles regarding the expedition. The expedition is covered in the newspapers of many countries and many languages.Deep in the jungle they arrive by float plane at a trading post. There to greet them is Costa (Jay Novello) and, playing the guitar and singing, Manuel Gomez (Fernanco Lamas). Costa is in charge of local arrangements and supplies. Gomez recognizes Roxton. Gomez is the helicopter pilot. Challenger is shocked to see pink luggage and boots on the dock. Jennifer enters and claims them, and then calls to her brother, David (Ray Stricklyn) and announces that they will both accompany the expedition. Challenger tells Jennifer she and her brother can leave on the float plane, but it leaves. The only other way out is on the helicopter. It is a fait accompli, so brother and sister accompany the expedition. Roxton and Jennifer talk that evening. She is still pursuing the man. After she goes to bed, Malone approaches Roxton and has it out with the man. Roxton informs Malone that Jennifer is coming for two reasons: the first is that she is brave, and secondly she wants to marry a title, namely his. He adds that Malone is interested in the girl. It seems everyone has an agenda, including Gomez.The next morning they fly to a high plateau. Challenger tells them he was at the base of the plateau and on the ledge above he saw a live dinosaur. They land in a clearing surrounded by large, prehistoric trees. Malone takes a picture of Jennifer, instead of Challenger. They set up camp. Summerlee chides Challenger that he hasn't seen any dinosaurs yet. That evening after supper they hear the roar of some great beast. Trees are being toppled as the creature heads their way. The party heads into the jungle. A strange plant grabs Jennifer around the neck. She is rescued as the lizard goes on a rampage. Costa, a highly nervous man, panics and runs into the jungle. Gomez takes off after him. He sees that the helicopter has been destroyed. The end of outside contact now, as the radio was destroyed. The party begins their trek inland. Roxton and Malone encounter a gigantic three-toed footprint. This seems to confirm Challengers dinosaur theory. Jennifer wanders off to catch her dog. Frosty has found a dinosaur and barks at it. Jennifer picks up her dog and then sees the gigantic creature for herself and screams. Challenger now feels vindicated and Summerlee apologizes for his disbelief. Malone takes pictures, and then they run from the roaring dinosaur. Malone and Challenger manage to fall down a hillside and spot a human female (Vitina Marcus) dressed in animal skins. Malone chases after her through a giant tunnel of spider web material. A huge, green tarantula drops down to menace the native girl. Malone shoots and kills the arachnid, then continues his search for the girl. The party reassembles at a new encampment. Malone returns with the girl in tow. She tries to escape, but is stopped. Challenger notes that she is a local Indian indicating that there must be a way up to the plateau from the jungle below. Roxton reproaches Malone for bringing the girl back. He explains that they are all in danger now, because her tribe will try to find her. Malone and Roxton get into a fight. Roxton finds a journal, the Burton White diary. It is three years old and Roxton is mentioned, as are diamonds. Gomez is looking for a name. Malone and Jennifer ask Roxton to explain. Roxton tells of the legend going back hundreds of years, ""a terror guarding riches."" Diamonds were Roxton's reason to finance the last expedition. Santiago was a member of the previous expedition, and Gomez is looking for him. Roxton admits he abandoned the last party. The journal ends with a notation that native tribes kidnapped the members of the expedition. They hear the roar of dinosaurs and bed down for the night. Costa sees the native girl sleeping and has lust in his eyes. She wakes and tries to escape, but David stops her. David tries to communicate with her. He shows her the rifle, and it is apparent she knows how to use it. Gomez sees something in the trees just outside camp. He calls to Malone and Roxton for help. A shot rings out and Summerlee is injured and the girl escapes. Malone finds Gomez injured; claims he was grabbed and knocked out. His rifle is missing. Malone, David and Roxton search for the girl. Malone loses the girl, but Jennifer joins him. They run from an approaching dinosaur. Malone fires his rifle at it, but it has little effect on the gigantic creature. A second dinosaur joins the first and they fight. In the melee, the tail of one knocks Malone and Jennifer over the edge, onto a ledge below. The fight continues until both creatures topple over the edge to their deaths below. When Jennifer and Malone return to camp it is empty and a shambles. The dog wanders back into camp, followed shortly thereafter by her brother, David. The tribe is above and captures the three remaining members of the expedition.They are led into a large chamber in the volcano. A ceremony is under way. The three new prisoners are led to a chamber to join their comrades. Costa is getting nervous and Challenger's observation that the natives are cannibals makes it worse. The native girl, who has developed an affection for David, enters the chamber from above. She motions for them to follow her. They follow the girl deeper into the volcanic cave system. The drums stop and the chief leads his guards to get the prisoners. He is shocked and angry to find them missing. The girl leads the explorers deeper into the tunnels and leads them to a solitary figure. He is an old white man, with long white hair and beard. The old blind man is Burton White (Ian Wolfe) and he warns that the volcano will explode soon. He tells them he is the only survivor and there is a way out via ""the cave of fire."" They hear the chief and his hunting party approaching. Burton refuses to join them on their escape. He claims he is too old and tired, but assures Roxton he will be safe, as it is a taboo to kill a blind man.The girl leads them on their escape. Gomez wants to kill Roxton now, but Costa convinces him later would be better, after they find the diamonds. Their first obstacle is a passage with plant arms that reach out to kill. The torch held by the native girl causes the plant arms to retract. Skeletons flank the passage showing what happens if the plants catch their prey. Next is a mist covered passage between the rib bones of a huge creature. This is the ""graveyard of the damned."" They run along the spinal vertebrae like stepping stones. It ends at a large pool of lava. They walk along a narrow ledge over the pool. The native girl refuses to go any further. Roxton takes the lead. They hug the wall face as the ledge becomes narrower. Challenger steps on a loose rock and falls over the ledge. He is assisted back up by David and Roxton. A passageway entrance is at the end of the ledge. Gomez hears the natives approaching and lights the brush on fire to slow their approach. The escapees push a boulder across the entrance to buy some time. They see the escape route exit and walk towards it. Costa finds his diamonds and Challenger and Summerlee find a dinosaur egg. They are informed by Gomez, ""This is the end of the journey."" He tells Roxton to drop his rifle. Costa greedily fills his hat with the uncut diamonds. Gomez explains, ""I want your life, Roxton. In exchange for that of a man you sent to his death when you deserted Burton White...I mean Santiago, my brother."" Malone throws the hat full of diamonds at Gomez. The commotion wakes a sea creature. It picks up Costa in its mouth and gnaws on the poor man's body. Challenger exclaims, ""Eaten alive. Horrible! Horrible!"" Malone climbs up to where a dam of lava has been built so that it can be broken. He pulls on the lever, but he has insufficient weight to pull it down. Gomez climbs up to help, then stays to finish the job. The dam breaks and Gomez and the lava tumble into the lake below. The water creature is killed. The remaining members of the party escape and follow the route through the volcano. Volcanic activity increases and the mountain is racked with earthquakes. They exit the cave at the jungle below the plateau. The volcano erupts and Challenger remarks, ""My lost world, lost forever."" Summerlee is disappointed because they have no proof. But Challenger corrects him, ""Oh yes we will."" And pulls out the dinosaur egg intact. ""I thought this might help."" Roxton pulls a handful of diamonds out of his pocket and gives Jennifer a couple. She kisses both Malone and Roxton. A ground tremor causes Summerlee to drop the egg. It breaks open and Challenger proudly announces, ""A baby dinosaur. Tyrannosaurus Rex...It will live long enough to grow as big as a house and terrify all London."" We close with the survivors surrounding and looking at the baby dinosaur."

A young philosophical intellectual Homer Thrace (Jules Dassin) arrives from America in search of the truth behind the fall of the greatness of ancient Greece when Plato and Aristotle lived. He is introduced to Ilya by his friend the Captain (Mitsos Ligizos) in the local taverna as she meets and dances with her male friends/clients. Homer is immediately smitten by Ilya and her spirit and - when he sees her leave with an English sailor after negotiating a price for the evening - equally horrified by her lifestyle. There is also a subplot regarding the other prostitutes, who admire Ilya for her freedom; however a local pimp named No Face (Alexis Salomos) keeps the women in high-priced apartments and isolated so they don't ""get ideas"".Homer can't accept Ilya's earthy feel-good philosophy, particularly when he finds that she has made up her own happy endings for the classical Greek tragedies, and refuses to accept the real plots even when she sees them performed at the annual festival. ""A whore can't be happy, a whorish world can't be happy!"" Homer exclaims. He believes that if he can show Ilya the cultural side of living for two weeks she will leave prostitution for a better life. Since Ilya cannot go for two weeks without a steady income, Homer pays her handsomely in return for her agreement to study the great art and philosophy of the world.She agrees partly because she is beginning to fall for one of her clients, a handsome half-Italian named Tonio (Giorgos Foundas) who is sincerely in love with her. Little does she know that No Face offers Homer a large amount of money to complete his task. The two weeks is a long affair in which Ilya endures her agreement to study instead of her regular activity, especially missing her Sundays when she has traditionally kept Open House for all her friends. Then her friend Despo (Despo Diamantidou), a prostitute who lives in one of No Face's apartments, discovers the source of Homer's educational fund and tells Ilya, and the experiment is over. Ilya furiously turns on Homer, then leads the other girls in a united revolt just as the Navy fleet comes into port; they blockade themselves inside the apartment block and throw mattresses and bedding down onto the heads of the frustrated sailors. They're jailed, and No Face's attorney arrives to bargain with them. The women hold the cards, and a satisfactory agreement is reached.Ilya returns to the taverna, where Homer has created a crisis by telling Taki, the virtuoso bouzouki player, that he's not a true musician because he can't read music. Taki has locked himself in the bathroom, but on the suggestion of one of the others, Ilya asks him through the door if the birds can read music. If they can't, should they stop singing? Taki comes out, happy to play again, and everyone joins in joyful dancing. Homer, a little drunk, admits to Ilya in front of all the others that he's wanted her since the first time he saw her. ""Oh, Homer, why didn't you say?"" she wonders. But Tonio intervenes. Sweeping her up in his arms, he cries, ""It's too late!"" and carries her out into the night. The Captain tells Homer that with love, anything is possible. Soon Homer, sadder but much wiser, is leaving for home. His ship pulls away from the pier, and he watches as Ilya and her friends dive into the water and wave a farewell, just as they'd greeted him at the beginning of the film."
Too Young to Love,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053366/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A court case ensues when a 47-year old man is caught with a 15-year old girl, and he claims he never knew she was so young."
Beyond the Time Barrier,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053651/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1960, a military test pilot is caught in a time warp that propels him to year 2024 where he finds a plague has sterilized the world's population. Experimental pilot testing a new rocket powered craft (actually a Convair F-102 interceptor) manages to fly into the future and land at the now deserted airbase he left. He ends up in a city with people who are suspicious he is a spy and who want to keep him to procreate with the rulers daughter because the majority of the inhabitants are sterile. He manages to escape and return to his own time but ""with consequences"".—Jamie Bone Major Bill Allison, a US Air Force test pilot, successfully flies the X-80 experimental aircraft into space, but loses radio contact mid-flight. When he returns to the air base, it looks abandoned, old and deserted. Mystified, he sees a futuristic city on the horizon and heads towards it before falling into unconsciousness and being captured.
When Allison awakens, he finds himself in a dystopian underground city known as the Citadel. Unperturbed by his captors' refusal to speak to him, Allison reacts hostilely at first, but eventually calms down and is brought to their leader, the Supreme. The latter explains that he and his second-in-command, the Captain, are the only two residents of the Citadel able to speak and hear her. The rest of the inhabitants, including the Supreme's granddaughter Trirene, are deaf and dumb, and all but Trirene are sterile. A telepath, she reads Allison's thoughts and tells the Supreme that she doesn't believe him to be a spy, as the Captain suspects.
The captain sends Allison to prison with a group of bald, violent mutants bent on killing everyone in the Citadel. As the mutants attack her, Allison overpowers one and demands answers. They claim to be survivors of a cosmic plague and blame the Citadel's inhabitants for their problems. The captain then releases Allison and explains that Trirene has convinced the supreme that he is not an enemy. Sensing his confusion, Trirene shows him historical photographs that help explain the Citadel's history and at his request leads him to two scientists and a Russian female officer.
After deactivating the monitoring devices, the scientists explain that Allison has travelled back in time to 2024. Nuclear weapons testing damaged the Earth's atmosphere, releasing radioactive rays. Those who fled underground, to the Citadel, were affected, although not as severely as those who remained above ground. We also learn that for 20 years, there have been no new births. The scientists themselves are accidental time travelers, since the captain, a Russian officer named Markova, and general Kruse have arrived from colonies on other planets. Markova explains that the Supreme needs Allison to try and repopulate their society with Trirene's help. The scientists then warn Allison not to trust the Citadel, while the captain in turn warns Allison not to trust the scientists.
As Trirene and Allison spend more time together, they eventually fall in love. Although initially reluctant, Allison joins the scientists in a plan to turn Trirene against his people so that he can return to the past and try to change history. For her part, Markova releases the mutants to attack the residents and demands to accompany Allison instead of Trirene. Kruss, accompanied by Bourman, arrives and shoots Markova for her betrayal. Then Bourman knocks Kruse out, explaining that Kruse was planning to hijack the plane. Bourman, however, also intends to use the X-80 to return to his own time. As Allison and Bourman struggle for Kruse's gun, a stray bullet kills Trirene before Allison can defeat Bourman.
Allison then takes Trirene's body to the Supreme, who is distraught at both the death of his granddaughter and the loss of his people. The Supreme directs Allison to a secret passage, convinced that there is still hope. Back in his own time, Allison recounts his fantastic adventure in a recorded debriefing. As senior officials visit Allison in hospital, it is revealed that he has aged considerably and is now an elderly man. Allison frantically warns them of future events, and one of them says they have a lot to think about."

Mill of the Stone Women,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054099/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 19th century Holland, a professor of fine arts and an unlicensed surgeon run a secret lab where the professor's ill daughter receives blood-transfusions from kidnapped female victims who posthumously become macabre art. Hans arrives in a town near Amsterdam to write a story on the reclusive sculptor, Professor Val, who lives on an island in the old mill house the locals call the Mill of the Stone Women. Hans meets the professor's beautiful and seductive daughter, and begins feeling passion for her despite his true love for Lisa Lotta. Slowly he becomes aware of the nefarious experiments being conducted by Val and his furtive assistant Dr. Boles, and local women continue to disappear.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> In the Nineteenth Century, in Rotterdam, Hans von Arnim arrives at the home in a mill of Prof. Gregorius Wahl in an island to research the centenary of his famous Stone Women Carousel that he inherited from his father. Prof. Wahl introduces his servant Selma and Dr. Loren Bohlem to Hans and offers an office for his work. Prof. Wahl is a professor of fine arts and teaches sculptures using his model Annelore to several students, including Hans' former sweetheart Liselotte Kornheim and his best friend Ralf Herbert. While working, Hans meets the beautiful daughter of Prof. Wahl, Elfie, and she asks him to return at eleven PM to see her. They have a torrid one night stand, but on the next day, Hans learns from Prof. Wahl that she has a disease and cannot have strong emotions. When she meets Hans again, he calls off their relationship and she dies. Hans leaves the mill completely disturbed and on the next day, he learns that Elfie is safe and sound. What is the secret of the Mill of the Stone Women?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Hans von Arnam [Pierre Brice] has just arrived by barge to Veeze, a small town not far from Amsterdam.
It is Hans' intention to collect information about the Mill of the Stone
Women, as it is known to the locals, and about the current owner,
professor and sculptor Gregorius Wahl [Robert Boehme], whose great grandfather created the
windmill and its eerie stone sculptures one hundred years ago. While
waiting for the housekeeper to summon the professor, Hans notices a
beautiful but sad-faced woman looking at him from behind a curtain. Before
he can say or do anything, he is directed by the housekeeper to wait in
the Professor's study. The housekeeper locks Hans in the study, but he
cannot miss the wails coming from behind the curtains. Alone in the study,
Hans has a chance to see the many stone sculptures in various stages of
preparation. He also comes upon a drawing of the young woman he just saw
behind the curtain. It is signed ""Elfi, 1912.""Suddenly, a grinding sound in the next room attracts Hans' attention.
Curtains open to reveal a moving carousel featuring a diorama of women
from history. A sculpture of Joan of Arc tied to a stake passes by,
followed by Cleopatra holding an asp. Just as suddenly as it began, the
carousel stops as the professor enters the room. He seems a bit taken
aback that Hans has arrived earlier than expected but gives him a pile of
documents and a room on the second floor where he can work in peace. He
also warns Hans that he must complete his studies in six days.The next day, while Hans works hard on his research, his friends
Liselotte [Dany Carrel] and Raab [Marco Guglielmi], both students at the Academy of Fine Arts where Wahl
teaches drawing and sculpture, are discussing how Hans showing up is
causing Liselotte to feel distracted, as she and Hans were childhood
friends. Raab is distracted himself...by the girl posing as today's model.
Unfortunately, Annelore [Liana Orfei] has just taken a job as a singer in Paris, so
there is no hope for Raab. Later that evening, Hans meets Raab and
Liselotte at a nearby tavern. Liselotte is hoping to rekindle something
with Hans, until Hans asks Raab about the professor's daughter, Elfi.
Liselotte can see the interest in Hans' eyes and walks away.The next day, Elfi [Scilla Gabel] comes to see Hans. She begs him to help her and
gives him a key to her bedroom with instructions to meet her there at 11
PM. At 10:30, Elfi calls it a day and goes up to bed. She is accompanied
by her doctor, Loren Bolem [Wolfgang Preiss], who compliments her on her passionate
piano-playing and wishes she felt such passion for him, but Elfi wants
nothing to do with the doctor, even when he reminds her that he's the only
one who knows her secret. At 11, Hans enters Elfi's bedroom as planned,
only to find her sleeping soundly, almost as though in death. When he
arouses her, Elfi confesses that she was dreaming of him, and she offers
herself to Hans right then and there. Hans doesn't resist.On Sunday, there is a scheduled public showing of the carousel. As
the villagers arrive, Hans is informed that he has two visitors, too. It
is Raab and Liselotte. While Raab watches the performance, Hans and
Liselotte hang back in order to express their love for each other.
Unbeknown to Hans, Elfi is standing on the balcony and overhears
everything. Elfi leaves a note on Hans' desk that says ""I must see you
tonight without fail. No one will be here. You must explain everything,
otherwise..."" When Liselotte faints at the sight of the macabre carousel,
Raab takes her home. The professor calls Hans to his office and tries to
warn him about his daughter's delicate medical condition. She must not be
subjected to any strong emotions or her life could be in danger. The
warning is pretty clear...Hans is not to mess with Elfi.That night, Hans meets Elfi as she requested. Elfi swears her love
for Hans but is devastated when he tells her that he doesn't love her and
that their night together was a mistake. She begs him to take her away
with him, but Hans refuses. Elfi grabs a knife and threatens to kill him,
but Hans turns away and heads for the door. Suddenly, Elfi gasps for a
breath and falls to the floor. Not knowing what to do, Hans carries Elfi
to her bedroom and lays her atop her bed. Hans notices a mirror on her bed
and holds it in front of her face. When he sees no condensation on the
mirror, he backs away in horror. Elfi is dead! Hans runs away.Some days later, Hans returns to the mill to confess all to the
professor. Wahl is extremely angry and holds Hans responsible for Elfi's
murder. He informs Hans that Elfi has already been buried in the Veeze
cemetery, but Hans is confused when he finds a fresh rose on his desk. Who
could have put it there if Elfi is dead? Seeing the state that Hans is in,
Dr Bolem gives him two tranquilizers that cause Hans to pass out. He
awakens to a dream (or hallucination?) of Elfi rising from her bed. He
hears the piano playing, but the door into the parlor is locked. He roams
the mill, sees Elfi laid out in her coffin, hears screams and sees a girl
tied to a chair. Hans is finally confronted by Dr Bolem and Professor
Wahl, who cannot understand what Hans is going on about. Suddenly, Elfi
comes down the stairs, having been awaken by all the shouting. Hans is
speechless, and Wahl arranges for him to be taken by carriage back to town.Now the truth comes out. Bolem and Wahl are trying to confuse Hans,
to make him believe he's had an episode of madness. Unfortunately, all the
excitement causes Elfi to have another attack. While the doctor prepares
Elfi, the professor fetches the tied up girl (Annelore). The ""treatment""
involves drawing off all of Elfi's ""bad blood"" and replacing it with blood
from Annelore along with a special serum developed by Bolem. As Elfi
revives, Annelore dies. Meanwhile, Hans is being taken care of by Raab and
Liselotte. His doctor believes Hans has suffered a nervous breakdown. Hans
is already feeling better and tells Liselotte that he's going to go to
Danzen, their home town, in order to ask Liselotte's parents for
permission to marry her.Back at the mill, Wahl is mummifying Annelore's body in preparation
for creating another statue for his macabre carousel. Bolem is performing
some tests on a sample of blood taken from Liselotte on the day she
fainted at the mill. Liselotte's blood type proves to be an exact match to
Elfi's, he tells Wahl, and transfusing Liselotte's blood into Elfi will
result in a total cure for Elfi's condition. Wahl can't wait and readies
the laboratory so that the transfusion can be performed as soon as
possible.When Hans returns from Danzen, he learns from the landlord that
Liselotte has been missing for the past 24 hours. In her room, Hans finds
her purse with her money and papers still in it. On her dresser, he sees a
photo of Liselotte with Annelore and recognizes Annelore as the girl he
saw tied to a chair at the mill. It wasn't a dream. It wasn't an
hallucination. It really happened. Looking for proof before going back to
the mill, Hans and Raab visit Elfi's grave and find it empty. Near the
tomb is a wax dummy of Elfi. Now certain that Hans wasn't dreaming,
hallucinating, or nuts, they break into the mill.The transfusion is underway in the basement laboratory. Liselotte is
ready, and they only have to anesthetize Elfi. A storm is brewing, and the
strong winds set the arms of the windmill turning. A new sculpture has
been added to the carousel, but the head falls off as the figure passes
before Hans and Raab. Raab picks up the head and recognizes it as the
mummified head of Annelore. Suddenly, a scream pierces the air. As Raab
and Hans struggle to get into the basement, Bolem confronts Wahl with a
request for Elfi's hand in marriage, but Wahl refuses.Knowing that this will be the last time Elfi will need to be
transfused and that Bolem's services are no longer needed, Wahl stabs
Bolem in the stomach and gets ready to conduct the transfusion himself. He
first removes Elfi's ""bad blood."" When he looks for the serum to transfuse
into Elfi along with Liselotte's blood, he cannot find it. He finally
thinks to look in Bolem's pocket, where he finds the syringe...broken in
Bolem's fall to the floor. With Elfi drained of blood and no hope of
reviving her, Wahl sets the lab burning, grabs Elfi's body, and rushes
upstairs just as Hans and Raab break down the door into the lab. They
untie Liselotte and carry her from the burning room. As the fire spreads
through the mill, the carousel turns. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Wild River,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054476/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A TVA bureaucrat comes to the river to do what none of his predecessors have been able to do - evict a stubborn octogenarian from her island before the rising waters engulf her. A young field administrator for the TVA comes to rural Tennessee to oversee the building of a dam on the Tennessee River. He encounters opposition from the local people, in particular a farmer who objects to his employment (with pay) of local black laborers. Much of the plot revolves around the eviction of an elderly woman from her home on an island in the River, and the young man's love affair with that woman's widowed granddaughter.—Sam Neff <samn@yang.earlham.edu> 1937. Chuck Glover, a big city northerner, is the latest and probably last in long line of people hired to head a property acquisition field office of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the job which has taken its toll on his predecessors. It is a short-term job in that the dam is already built downstream with that section of the valley soon to be flooded. There is only one last property that needs to be acquired, an island in the river belonging to long widowed octogenarian Ella Garth, who has so far refused to sell. Chuck's superiors would rather he come to a negotiated settlement with Mrs. Garth than force her off the land, as they do not want the negative publicity of bullying an eighty-year-old woman. Upon Chuck's initial visit to the island, he finds that four generations of Garths still live there, along with a large number of black sharecroppers of whom Mrs. Garth generally takes care. As Mrs. Garth doesn't say a word in that initial visit, Chuck believes she may be senile. Although Mrs. Garth doesn't like what Chuck is trying to do to her, he finds he begins to have a deep affection for her. She is not senile but one of the most clear-headed and principled people he knows; she just has a special emotional attachment to the land where she has long lived. Some speculate that Mrs. Garth would not survive living anywhere else, a premature demise which Chuck does not want to see in his respect for her. What may be just as problematic for Chuck is the idea he has to take care of the black sharecroppers on her land, whom he wants to see treated as fairly as any citizen of the valley. This idea does not sit well with the white racist element of the area, led by the brutish Hank Bailey. Further complicating the situation is the fact that Chuck and Mrs. Garth's widowed granddaughter Carol Baldwin fall for each other. One of the complicating factors is that Carol is engaged to kind and caring Walter Clark, a man she doesn't love and would only marry for a father for her two small children.—Huggo"

There is a new world federation for the investigation of space, and a space station is establishes on the Moon.Harringway Hawling (Oldrich Lukes), an atom-physicist, thinks that the material was the remains of an alien ship which exploded when entering out atmosphere. He makes his theories public.A computer tries to translate the alien language. Hawling thinks that the alien ship must have come from Venus, the morning star. They think they have identified some utterances, the first coming from another planet. Professor Sikarna (Kurt Rackelmann) wants all radio stations to focus on the message to Venus. Dr Tchen Yu (Tang Hua-Ta) wonders why such a technologically advanced society cannot be bothered to communicate more clearly with Earth's societies.

The crew decides not to panic over it, and they will try to communicate with the aliens to say that they want peace. They can't talk with Earth to warn them either. There is a suggestion of returning earlier, but the crew decides to go on with the mission in spite of the danger.They have a meeting, as they can only land and take off once.

But Earth, without knowing it, started a chain reaction above an atomic warehouse, unknowingly.To leave Venus, they play around with Einstein's ideas, changing speed and energy onto mass and vice versa. Robert has to stay in Venus, just when Sumiko realizes that the insect is growing, which proves that there's still life in Venus. Robert dizzily overhears that, being left on the planet. Finally, Robert can communicate with Sumiko, who wants to go back for him. Robert is walking around in his spacesuit. He shouts because he doesn't want to be left behind.However, the spaceship has to go on. They come back to Earth and everybody is waiting for them. They leave the spaceship and explain that they have learned a lot, but that they paid a huge price.

The job is a bank robbery, and military discipline and planning are imposed by Hyde and second-in-command Race on the team, although civilian irritations do start getting in the way.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Forced into early retirement after twenty-five years of Army service, Lieutenant Colonel Hyde recruits seven other officers to stage a dating bank robbery. The seven former officers were all forced out of Army for indiscretions, some quite serious, but all have a specialty that Hyde needs to make the robbery a success. Before robbing the bank however, they stage several raids to get the weapons and trucks they need, and all go off without a hitch. The robbery is planned with military precision, and it too goes as planned, except for one simple error on their part.—garykmcd A manhole opens at night in an empty street and out climbs Lieutenant-Colonel Norman Hyde (Jack Hawkins) in a dinner suit. He gets into a Rolls-Royce and drives home. There, he prepares seven envelopes, each containing an American crime paperback called ""The Golden Fleece"", half a £5 note and an unsigned invitation from ""Co-operative Removals Limited"" to lunch at the Café Royal. He then posts the envelopes to seven former army officers, each in desperate or humiliating circumstances.A few days later, the men in question turn up at the Café Royal. After lunch, Hyde dismisses the waiters and introduces himself. He hands out the second halves of the £5 notes and asks their opinion of the novel in which a robbery is committed by experts. When they show little enthusiasm, he expresses surprise given their backgrounds and asks: ""You're all crooks, aren't you? Of one kind or another"". Touring the table, pouring out the brandy, he reveals why they were obliged to leave the British Army and their unenviable present occupations:Major Peter Race (Nigel Patrick) was a transport officer who resigned before his black market ring was uncovered in post-war Hamburg. He earns a poor living in unlicensed gambling and lives at the YMCA. He prides himself on his high breeding and addresses men as ""old darling"";Major Rupert Rutland-Smith (Terence Alexander) is the hen-pecked husband of a wealthy young woman who delights in pulling his strings because he depends on her money. She also has affairs to which he can only turn a blind eye;Captain Mycroft (Roger Livesey) was a quartermaster dismissed for public gross indecency. He is now a con-man impersonating vicars and priests. He also enjoys lewd books;Captain Martin Porthill (Bryan Forbes) was dishonourably discharged for killing suspected members of the Cyprus-based EOKA terrorist organisation (Cyprus was a British colony at the time). He now works as a piano player in nightclubs and as a gigolo to middle-aged women;Captain Stevens (Kieron Moore) was fascist follower of Oswald Mosley before joining up when World War Two began. He now runs a gymnasium. A homosexual, he needs money to pay a blackmailer (male relationships of a sexual nature being illegal at the time);Captain Frank Weaver (Norman Bird) was the head of a bomb disposal squad who tried to defuse a bomb while drunk, killing four of his soldiers. He has been a teetotaller ever since and owns a small shop fixing clocks and watches, living with his garrulous wife (Doris Hare) and ageing father-in-law;Lieutenant Edward Lexy (Richard Attenborough) is a communications specialist who was dismissed for selling information to the Russians. He runs a struggling repair shop for radios and fruit machines.Hyde tells them he has no criminal record himself but does have a grievance for being made redundant by the army after a lengthy career. He is now aims to rob a bank using the team's skills!Race follows Hyde home. He is interested in the scheme but warns Hyde to watch out for the others, who might just double-cross him. Hyde agrees, yet insists each man receive an equal share of the loot because ""the one, sure way to disaster is for someone to get greedy"". After talking the plan over, Race agrees to Hyde's terms, stating that ""you're losing a friend, but gaining a second-in-command"", to which Hyde answers, ""I'll settle for that"".The gang meet under the guise of an amateur dramatic society rehearsing ""Journeys End"" to discuss the plan (during which they are interrupted by a rather campOliver Reed). They then move into Hyde's house and begin to live a strict military regime of duties, varying from cooking to preparing for the robbery. Hyde knows that a million pounds in used notes is regularly delivered to a City of London bank and has details of the delivery. What they need now is the equipment to pull it off.They raid an army training camp in Dorset for arms and supplies. Hyde, Mycroft, Porthill and Race distract the soldiers by posing as senior officers on an unscheduled food inspection. The others steal weapons while posing as telephone repairmen, speaking in Irish accents to divert suspicion to the IRA (Irish Republican Army) terrorist organisation.Equipment, including smoke bombs, are prepared in a rented warehouse. Race steals various vehicles including a truck and false number plates are also made. At one stage they are disturbed by the chance passing of a policeman who offers to keep an eye on their premises as part of his beat.In Hyde's basement, the gang train for and plan the robbery using maps and models. On the eve of the operation, Hyde destroys the plans and sighs: they have reminded him of his days of military glory.The robbery is bloodless and precise. Using smoke bombs, sub-machine guns and radio-jamming equipment, the gang raids the bank, near St Paul's. The loot is seized without serious injury and the robbers successfully escape, every stage having been carefully planned and practiced.At Hyde's house, celebrations are interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Hyde's old friend, Brigadier ""Bunny"" Warren (Robert Coote), who drunkenly recalls the old days. One by one the members leave carrying money-filled suitcases. Then the telephone rings: Hyde is told that police and soldiers surround the house.Leading the police is Superintendent Wheatlock (Ronald Leigh-Hunt) from whom Hyde learns the fatal flaw in his plan: a small boy outside the bank had been noting car registration (licence plate) numbers in his note book, a common hobby at the time. The police, discovering the number, found it had been noted by the policeman who visited the warehouse, who had also noted the number of Hyde's own car. Thus a link was formed between the robbery and Hyde.Hyde is escorted to a prison wagon in which he finds the rest of the League of Gentlemen ""all present and correct""."

London at the turn of the century in 1901. Three men are on a mission from the IRA to steal all the gold in the vaults of the Bank of England. Norgate, their leader, discovers the bank's weak spot: an old forgotten sewer straight under the vaults. But they have to deal with captain Fitch, a young but suspicious bank guard.—Mattias Thuresson Early in the last century. Irish rebels descend on London intent on emptying the gold vaults of the Bank of England. They are assisted by an American sympathizer, Charles Norgate, an engineer by profession who is tasked on finding a weak spot in the Bank's security. He befriends the Captain of the Guards unit that provide overnight security and gains access to the subterranean passages under the bank. He finds the fatal flaw in their security - an abandoned sewer line that runs very near the gold vaults - and it's a race against time to break in.—garykmcd This crime caper based on a legendary robbery stars Aldo Ray as Norgate, the ringleader of the thieves out to steal a bundle from the Bank of England. But it is a young Peter O'Toole as the guard Fitch who steals the show -- two years before Lawrence of Arabia would make him an internationally acclaimed star. The year is 1901 and Norgate is an avid supporter of Irish Home Rule, avid enough to plan this robbery to get the bullion needed to make his independence wishes come true. He gathers together the necessary crew of brains, brawn, and bravado, and the would-be thieves make their way through a sewer system that runs under the bank. What they do not count on is that Fitch may not be quite as dumb as he seems. (New York Times)"

In his office Dr. Paul Talbot (Phillip Terry) is serving a drink to his older wife, June Talbot (Coleen Gray). She is an alcoholic and the couple fight over money and his inattention. She has money and uses it to keep her husband in line, he needs her money to continue his research on reversing the aging process. They finally agree that divorce is the only answer. His nurse, Sally (Gloria Talbott), enters as June is leaving. She tells the doctor his next appointment, Malla, is ready and is very, very old--in her words, ""looks like she came right out of a mummy's tomb."" In the waiting room, Malla confronts June and tells her that she won't have to divorce her husband, ""you won't have to: he will die."" Dr. Talbot and the nurse examine Malla, and she tells him she is 152 years old. Of course, Dr. Talbot does not believe her. Malla explains that she and her mother were sold into slavery, but they come from a tribe that has discovered a substance that retards the aging process. She calls the powder Naipe (pronounced ni-pee). If another substance is added to this powder it will reverse the aging process and return the woman to youth. The doctor asks for a demonstration. Malla takes some of the powder, mixes it with water and consumes it. She then directs the doctor to perform the blood test again.At home, June is meeting with her lawyer, Neil Foster (Grant Williams). They discuss the details of the divorce and property division. She is drinking and getting quite drunk and maudlin. Dr. Talbot arrives and is in a very upbeat mood. He shows Neil and June the powder and explains that is retards the aging process. He explains that is comes from an African plant and that he wants June to join him on an expedition to find the source. Divorce talks are off.In Africa, Talbot and June meet with a guide, Bertram Garvay (John Van Dreelen). [Note: the cast list shows his name as Bertram Garvay, but June repeatedly addresses him as David.] Talbot tries to hire him to lead them to Malla's tribe--the Nando people. Garvay explains that her tribe hates Europeans and that the government forbids anyone bothering them. Garvay is enticed by a $5000 up front fee and a promise of $20,000 later. Garvay suspects that the doctor is interested in the rumors of the anti-aging power and tells him so.Garvay, the Talbots, and many porters trek through the jungle in search of Malla's tribe. They set up camp that evening and discuss the plan for the next day. Talbot and June get into a fight and she threatens to leave. Talbot changes his attitude to keep her on the journey, and blurts out his real reason for needing her along. He tells her he wants to make her young again. She is furious, and runs off into the jungle. She is chased by a leopard, but Garvay shoots the leopard just in time.The next day they discover the litter and Malla's walking stick. In addition they find her party of guides and porters dead, but she is not among them. They return to their own camp, but are captured by scouts of the Nando tribe. They are tied up and marched back to the Nando village. They are housed in a hut under heavy guard.Old Malla comes to visit Talbot, June and Garvay in the hut. She shows them the plant, an orchid, and explains some of the process. Malla asks them if they want to see her made young again. They agree and are brought to the main building for a demonstration. They are horrified and fascinated to discover that to be made young again calls for a human male sacrifice. The second ingredient Malla alluded to was pineal gland juice. The victim is drugged and struck on the neck with a special ring. The powder and pineal gland fluid is consumed, and results in an immediate transformation of Old Malla to Young Malla (Kim Hamilton). Some are skeptical, but as proof Young Malla shows the doctor the same slavers scar on her chest he saw in his office.Unfortunately for the doctor and his party, Malla explains that they will not be allowed to leave with the secret, and that they have but one day to live. When Young Malla dies, they will be killed by the tribe. But as a consolation to June, she offers her a chance to be young again. June agrees, and must select a victim, and she chooses her husband. Malla is pleased and tells her that she shall have beauty and revenge at the same time. Garvay creates a diversion to return to the hut and get some dynamite, while Talbot is killed and June is made young again. Garvay steals some powder, the special ring, and he and June escape into the jungle with the tribe in hot pursuit. The dynamite pretty much takes care of them.The next morning Garvay explains that he took some of the powder and the ring. But as Malla had promised, June's youth is fleeting, and she starts to age rapidly. Garvay is repulsed by her appearance and runs away from her. He falls into quicksand. June makes him give her the powder and ring in exchange for her assistance, but she kills him and extracts his pineal fluid and leaves his dead body to the quicksand.Sally and Neil wait for June at the airport, but are surprised to find June's ""niece"", Terry Hart instead. Terry explains that Aunt June will be coming later. They take her to June's house. Neil lingers a little too long helping Miss Hart, much to Sally's annoyance. Sally and Neil are engaged to be married, and Sally immediately takes a dislike to Terry. She is jealous and lets Neil know in no uncertain terms.June, looking even older than before, shows up at Neil's law office to ask for money and her jewelry. June has now deduced that she will need to kill more men, more often, to keep herself young. One evening she picks up a younger man, Jerry (Arthur Batanides). She kills him in her car for her latest youth fix.Neil and Sally's relationship has deteriorated, but Sally decides to confront Terry and convince her to leave town, at the point of a gun. After a brief struggle, Terry kills Sally and extracts pineal fluid from her, but it doesn't work to make her younger. She killed Sally for nothing.That evening, Neil comes over to have a drink with Terry. He tells her he never loved Sally, and asks Terry to marry him. Terry refuses, but won't explain why. The police stop by to question June, but Neil explains that June isn't home. They search the house and discover Sally's body in the entry closet. Terry bolts upstairs, while aging rapidly, and locks herself in her room. The police start forcing the door, but before they can get in we hear the sound of breaking glass and a scream. She crashes into a glass patio table below. We close with a closeup of an extremely old and dead June Talbot."

Captain Robert Adams, who seems to be working toward his own agenda, has to decide what to do. He is getting conflicting advice from his officers and crew. The problems for him are surveying and dealing with the damage, assessing and dealing with what potential damage may still occur - the main initial problem seeming to be that one of the bulkheads may burst, which may cause the ship to sink - not causing mass hysteria among the passengers, and if they do decide to abandon ship, weighing the dangers involved doing so mid-ocean. All the while, Cliff has to get both Laurie and Jill out of precarious situations with little help from other passengers or crew. He may have to make some difficult life and death decisions for himself and his family.—Huggo The SS Claridon is scheduled for her fifth and last voyage after thirty-eight years of service. After an explosion in the boiler room, Captain Robert Adams is reluctant to evacuate the ship. While the crew fights to hold a bulkhead between the flooded boiler room and the engine room and avoid the sinking of the ship, Cliff Henderson struggles against time trying to save his beloved wife, Laurie, who is trapped under a steel beam in their cabin, with the support of crew member Hank Lawson.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"

The daughter raised by Minos tries to have her twin killed, but failing in her first attempt, continues to try to have her given to the Minotaur. Theseus, the Greek hero, tries to prevent it.—merryann@palmersrv.com In ancient Crete, a monster called the Minotaur (half bull, half man) can only be satisfied by virgin sacrifices.

The monster is venerated as a god, and to appease it, the Cretians regularly sacrifice a maiden to it.One day, Minos' wife Pasiphaë is dying of natural causes. On her deathbed, she reveals that her daughter, the royal princess Phaedra, was not their only child: A twin sister, Ariadne, lives in secrecy on the Greek mainland in a humble village. She was brought there to avoid being sacrificed to the Minotaur, but now the queen's last wish is to see her daughters united again. While Minos consents to his wife's last request, Phaedra, who is a power-hungry and evil schemer, refuses to share the throne and sends out her loyal retainer, Chirone, to kill Ariadne. Chirone raids the village with a group of hired brigands, killing everyone including Ariadne's foster parents, but Ariadne is rescued by Theseus, son of King Aegeus of Athens, and his Cretan friend Demetrio, who happen to pass by.

But Chirone notices that his princess has suddenly changed in her demeanor and reveals his knowledge to Ariadne, but promises to keep her secret as long as she surrenders herself to him.In the meantime, however, Aegeus, presuming his son to have been murdered, has led a war against Crete and lost. As a tribute, the people of Athens must now surrender a group of young people in regular intervals as sacrifices to the Minotaur. As the first group, which is joined by Theseus, is about to be herded into the labyrinth, Theseus manages to procure a sword and voluntarily enters the labyrinth and slays the Minotaur. Upon Theseus' brave decision, a riot breaks out and Chirone is killed by the mob. Ariadne, who has followed Theseus, helps him out with a thread from her own gown whose other end she had tied to the labyrinth's entrance, and they return alive and to the jubilation of the Cretan people."

Falsely accused of murder, they must flee across the Highlands, evading the redcoats.—Cleo <frede005@maroon.tc.umn.edu> Edinburgh, Scotland, 1752. David Balfour (James MacArthur) is a 16-year-old Lowland Scot who is given a letter by Mr. Campbell, a friendly local minister which was written by David's recently-deceased father, to go to the House of Shaws, a dark and dreary mansion in a bleak landscape to claim an inheritance. David never knew that his poor father was related to such a high class family.The following day, David asks a local woman for directions to the House of Shaws and is told not to go there by Jennet Clouston, whom she claims that she was forced out of her home by Ebenezer Balfour, the man residing there whom is a heartless slumlord. David arrives and knocks on the front door where he is greeted not so warmly by his miserly uncle Ebenezer (John Laurie), his late father's heartless older brother.An attempt to arrange a fatal accident when Ebenezer asks David to run up a dark stairway to a nonexistent room to fetch some legal papers, which leads to a dead end, makes it clear that Ebenezer has no affection for his nephew. However, David is not sufficiently on his guard.The next day, a 10-year-old cabin-boy, named Ransome, arrives at the house with a letter. The letter says that they are invited to the nearby shipping post where Ebenezer has some business.

Strangers When We Meet,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054345/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A suburban architect loves his wife but is bored with his marriage and with his work, so he takes up with the neglected, married beauty who lives down the street. The awarded architect Larry Coe lives a boring marriage with his wife Eve Coe and their two young sons in the suburb. Larry is designing and constructing an unique house to the successful writer Roger Altar (Ernie Kovacs) on the top of a hill. Margaret 'Maggie' Gault is a sexy blond sexually neglected by her husband Ken Gault that lives in the same neighborhood and they have a young son. When Larry meets Maggie at the bus stop of the school bus, he unsuccessfully hits on her. But soon they encounter each other again and they have a love affair. They fall in love with each other, but when their despicable neighbor Felix Anders discovers their affair, they have to decide between loyalty and respect to their families or love.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Architect Larry Coe has a wife and family, but becomes embroiled in an affair with beautiful Maggie Gault, a neighbor with her own family. The two lovers are forced to face the choice between love and loyalty.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> Kirk Douglas plays Larry Coe, a Los Angeles architect who's married with two kids. He has a very bright wife, Eve. She's ambitious for him, but he wants to do work more imaginative than the commercial buildings he's designing. Maggie Gault (Kim Novak), one of his neighbors whose son is friends with his son, helps him get a commission to build a house for an eccentric writer named Roger Alter (Ernie Kovacs, for comic relief). Both Larry and Maggie are dissatisfied in their marriages. Larry's wife is too hard-headed and practical and Maggie's husband isn't interested in having sex with her (or maybe he can't). So they have an affair that involves lots of walking on the beach and having drinks in oceanside hideaways. They both know what they're doing is wrong, and they each love their spouses in their own way and they're devoted to their children.Felix Anders (Walter Matthau) is a dirty old man neighbor who snoops around and finds out about their affair. His leering and insinuations to Larry makes Larry realize the risks he's taking and he tells Maggie that they shouldn't see each other for a while. Felix, in the meantime, makes a play for Larry's wife Eve in an unbelievably creepy scene. In a way, Felix is a personification of the tawdriness of Larry and Maggie's affair. After her near-rape by Felix, Eve wises up and realizes that Larry has been unfaithful. She confronts him and they agree to stay together and move to Hawaii, where Larry has been offered a job to design a city.Roger Alter's house is finished but still empty. Maggie drives up to take a look at it. Larry shows up and they talk about how they can never be together. Larry tells Maggie that he wishes they could live in the house and if they did, he would dig a moat around it and never leave it. Maggie doesn't say anything. Maybe she's thinking it's just as well the affair ended after all. The contractor for the house shows up and thinks Maggie is Larry's wife (which is strange because Eve has been a regular visitor to the building site). They both take a moment to savor the irony of his remark and Maggie drives away. On the way out of the driveway, one of the construction workers leers at her. She's not immune to one night stands, so she's already being put to the test. She drives back into their banal suburban enclave while Larry stands out on the house's balcony savoring the view of Los Angeles and no doubt thinking deep thoughts.This is a long film that moves along at a leisurely pace that reflects the time when it was made. Larry is a successful architect, yet he still can take his kids to the school bus stop and have time to carry on his affair with Maggie without his wife suspecting (even though he works at home, she doesn't keep much of an eye on him). None of the women in the film work; they don't have to because their husbands have jobs that can support a family on one paycheck. America was a more economically secure country then. The film has nice expansive feel despite the constricted lives the characters lead."
12 to the Moon,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054415/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An international team embarks on an expedition to the moon in an uncommonly spacious rocketship. There they encounter a faceless alien intelligence who conclude that the human race is too immature and dangerous and must be destroyed. The movie opens with the launch of a rocket and missiles from various cities around the world. A gavel bangs down and we cut to the title and credits. The Secretary General of the International Space Order (Francis X. Bushman) explains that a program to launch a rocket to the moon is underway. The moon will be proclaimed as international territory. Rocket Ship Lunar Eagle 1 will be crewed by twelve crew members from around the world. Dr. Erich Heinrich (John Wengraf) designed and supervised the construction of the rocket. He is the oldest crew member. The youngest member of the crew is Rod Murdock (Robert Montgomery, Jr.). Dr. Selim Hamid (Muzaffer Tema as Tema Bey) is from Turkey and a medical doctor. Assisting Dr. Hamid is Dr. Sigrid Bomark (Anna-Lisa) from Sweden. She is both a physician and physicist. From France is Dr. Etienne Martel (Roger Til), engineer and technician. Sir William Rochester (Phillip Baird) is a noted British Geophysicist. Dr. Hideko Murata (Michi Kobi) will be acting as astro-photographer and pharmacist. The Russian Geologist and Cartographer is Dr. Feodor Orloff (Tom Conway). Dr. Asmara Markonen (Cory Devlin) is a Nigerian Astronomer and will be acting as chief navigator. Dr. David Ruskin (Richard Weber) is an aeronautic engineer and will be keeping the official log. Dr. Luis Vargas (Anthony Dexter) is from Brazil and is the pilot. The twelfth member of the crew is the leader, Captain John Anderson (Ken Clark).The twelve crew members take a freight elevator to the crew quarters. Anderson turns on the lights and the crew take their stations. Many animals have been brought aboard earlier including a dog, a pair of cats and monkeys, and a cage of birds. They are all wearing their space suits, but don their helmets for take-off. Ruskin records the first log entry just before take-off. Anderson grabs the control switch and launches the ship. After launch, we see the crew and animals react to the G-forces of acceleration. The crew occupy two decks on the ship. At 1500 miles above the Earth they switch to atomic power. Doctors Bomark and Hamid perform post-launch medical exams on the crew. Murdock asks Rochester about the equipment used to take pictures of the Earth. The only crew member who is not quite up to the stresses of space travel is Dr. Heinrich. There are some politically motivated conflicts between the crew members that involve World War II and the Cold War.Radar picks up a meteor cluster approaching the ship. They manage to pass without causing any damage to the ship. Dr. Orloff proudly claims credit, ""It worked perfectly. After all it was our invention."" Dr. Heinrich adds, ""With a little help from our German scientists."" Dr. Bomark proudly explains how the shower works, ""Cleaned by ultrasound and massaged by air spray jets."" The ladies have not quite finished in the bathroom when Anderson struts up to the bathroom door wearing only a towel. He apologizes for barging in.They approach the moon and run into another meteor shower, but this time it is a cloud that must be destroyed with a rocket. They turn the ship around and allow gravity to pull them towards the surface of the moon. Landing will be in about an hour and a half. Murdock, Heinrich, and Ruskin compute their trajectory for landing. Unfortunately Ruskin dredges up the Nazi involvement by a man who did the early work on the mathematics of rocketry. Ruskin does not know that Heinrich is the son of that same mathematician who was involved in the genocide of his parents and family. Bomark calls Rod Murdock over and explains the situation about Ruskin and Heinrich. Heinrich changed his name. Anderson tells his crew to prepare for landing on the surface of the moon. Anderson calls Earth Control to let them know they've landed safely on the moon. The crew prepares to disembark the ship to walk on the surface. Martel will stay behind to see after the ship.Anderson and Vargas are the first to leave the ship. We see the surface of the moon with several river channels and a low, steaming volcanic cinder cone. Also shown is a humanoid figure receding into the shadows. The crew assembles on the surface and Ruskin records his notes. They plant a flag on the surface and begin their scientific exploration. They set up a magnetic perimeter in a valley and explore for rock specimens. Doctors Bomark and Hamid search for signs of air and life. The pair finds a cave with steam billowing inside. They enter and detect a breathable atmosphere. Weird cactus-like plants are scattered with mushroom shaped growths on them. Hamid picks one and hands it to Bomark. It explodes into flames in her hands. Combustion suggests oxygen in the atmosphere of the cave. The other nine crew have found rocks and piled them up for evaluation by Orloff. The first specimen examined is gold and Orloff dismisses it and tosses it aside. He does spot something that piques his interest. It is a large glowing stone, ""It's like fire, like liquid fire."" But Markonen warns, ""It's beautiful, but evil. Evil and sharp like the jewel of Medea."" Orloff likes the observation, and names the find the Medea Stone. Hamid and Bomark continue to explore the cave. Hamid tells Bomark, ""There must be air."" He takes off his helmet and can breathe. Bomark takes her helmet off and the two embrace and kiss. They pass through a portal and it closes behind them as a wall of ice. The remaining nine decide to use explosives to mine for more samples. A rock face is blown up and a liquid pours out. Orloff does not employ good judgment and places his hands in the liquid and is severely burned. Their air supply is running low. Hideko takes Orloff back to the ship and the others search for Bomark and Hamid.They find clues that the pair went into the cave. They search and find their helmets and the wall of ice. They are unable to chip away the wall and decide to return later. Rochester gets stuck in quicksand and is pulled under. The others try to help, but he sinks deeper. Anderson also starts to sink but their magnetic meteor deflector equipment is employed to pull him out. Rochester sinks deeper and disappears into the sandy soil. They do manage to rescue Anderson and return to the ship. Toll so far, three crew members either dead or missing. The crew managed to return to the ship just as the lunar night begins and the outside temperature drops. Anderson reports that all communication with Earth has failed. All lights in the ship dim and a weird humming sound is noticed. A message appears on their equipment in a strange foreign language. The characters are vaguely Japanese in appearance and Hideko is asked to translate if possible. She is able to read it, ""I speak for the great coordinator of the moon. We advise and warn you. Return to Earth at once. You have done enough damage. You have been bombarding us for years, incessantly. Leave us in peace. We read your minds, we know your every thought. Cannot speak as you do, we communicate through thought waves."" They continue by explaining they live underground and the crew must leave at once. They acknowledge that Bomark and Hamid are with them. Dr. Heinrich starts gasping and collapses. He has suffered a heart attack. He mutters in his state of consciousness and reveals to Ruskin that he is the son of Bernauer, the man who murdered Ruskin's whole family.The moon people send another message. They request the two cats be left behind. Vargas and Murdock take the two cats outside and leave them in their cage. Two creatures, seen only in shadow, retrieve the cats and carry them away. The ship departs the surface of the moon. The dog begins barking to warn the crew of a fire on board. The Medea Stone sample has started burning. A fire extinguisher is employed, along with a fire blanket, to get the stone in an airlock. A routine radio check with the Earth is cut short. Hideko reminds Anderson that the moon people told them they could immobilize them at will. They manage to avoid another meteor shower. A strange sound is heard when they are 500 miles above the Earth. They notice the temperature inside the ship has dropped to 55 degrees and on Earth the North American continent is freezing. Various cities are seen freezing. Heinrich deduces that the process is like an implosion bomb, the H-bomb in reverse. Heinrich calls together Ruskin and Murdock to work on a solution. Heinrich proposes a solution: build a bomb and pilot the taxi ship over a volcano and drop the bomb into it. He warns that it will probably be a suicide mission.Martel completes the bomb under Orloff's supervision. When Orloff leaves, Martel sabotages the bomb but is caught. He wants the North American continent to freeze so the Soviet Union and his fellow travelers can take over the world. Orloff disagrees with the Frenchman, and they struggle. Anderson breaks up the fight. They draw lots, using tongue depressors, to select the crew for the mission. The two chosen are Ruskin and Heinrich. Ruskin leaves a final log entry explaining what he and Heinrich will attempt. Heinrich and Ruskin manage to break through the atmosphere and drop their bomb into the volcano, but are unable to pull out and are killed in an explosion. The ship is now caught in the freeze. The cabin begins to freeze over. Then a message comes through. The moon people tell the crew, ""Now you have seen our strength, but we have seen your human strength. The way your people have sacrificed themselves to save the others. To those you left behind, we have also learned that all your Earth emotions are not evil and war-like. That you have come to us in peace. Your people on Earth have been in suspended animation and have not been harmed. Return to Earth at once and someday, when you come back, you will be welcome."" Communication with Earth is restored. Anderson tells the crew, ""Prepare for landing."" We close with a view of Earth at sunrise."

It's the early twentieth century. The Morel family lives in the coal mining community of Bestwood, England, just outside of Nottingham.

The owner of the castle, a strange nobleman, has a secret laboratory in the basement and has his own plans for the girls. Lucas [Alfredo Rizzo], manager of five showgirls -- Vera [Lyla Rocco] , Katia [Maria Giovannini], Erika [Erika Dicenta], Ilona, and Magda -- has just skipped out on their hotel bill and is trying to reach the
next town in their bus when they learn that the road has been blocked by a
landslide. Since they can't turn back, they take the only other road,
which leads to the Castle of Kernassy, a place where no local would dare
to go. Lucas could care less about local superstitions. Thinking about the
possibility of free digs, he heads for the castle. When they arrive at the
gate, Vera senses a strange feeling of familiarity, but the caretakers
tell them to move on, until Count Gabor Kernassy [Walter Brandi] sets eyes on Vera.
Suddenly, he agrees to put them up for the night. There is a condition,
however. No one is to leave their bedrooms at night, regardless of what
they might hear.As a storm rages, Vera notices the Count looking at her through the
window. She confronts him, but he only wants to talk about her background.
Where does she come from? Vera provides little details due to the fact
that her parents died when she was young. Later, Katia comes to Vera's
room because she can't sleep and then decides to take a shower. Because it
is rather cold, Katia slips into Vera's coat. Before showering, however,
Katia goes exploring after hearing a kitten meowing. She follows it to a
tower room.The next morning, Katia is found dead on the ground at the foot of
the tower. It appears that she has fallen. Unfortunately, the river has
risen, and the visitors are forced to stay longer at the castle, even
though they now want to leave. Later, after Katia is buried and while the
girls rehearse their dances, Vera returns to her room to rest. While
walking through the corridor, she notices a painting of Margherita
Kernassy, who looks remarkably like Vera herself. When Vera asks the Count
to tell her about Margherita, he explains that she was an ancestor of his
who died in the 1780s. Because he thinks Vera might be a reincarnation of
Margherita, he warns her to leave the castle as quickly as possible. Vera
admits that she feels at home in the castle and safe with the Count. They
fly into each others' arms.Later that evening, as Vera is getting undressed for bed, she notices
the shadow of a man slinking along her wall. She tosses on a coat and goes
looking for him in the gardens. When she passes Katia's grave, she is
horrified to find that Katia's body has been dug up and removed. Then she
notices the Count standing in the bushes. When she attempts to speak with
him about Katia's body, he runs off. The housekeeper is of no help either.
In fact, she admonishes Vera for being too curious.The next morning, Vera goes looking for the Count and wanders into
what looks like a laboratory where she discovers Katia's body. When Vera
confronts him, the Count admits that he dug up Katia's body in order to
continue his investigation into a ""diabolical"" force that turns men into
immortal monsters and gives them an insatiable thirst for human blood. He
also suspects someone murdered Katia, thinking her to be Vera because she
was wearing Vera's coat at the time. But who would want to kill Vera? The
Count warns her again not to leave her room after nightfall, not even if
she hears his voice calling to her.That night, a naked Katia baring fangs appears to Lucas, but he goes
into a faint. Vera hears someone outside her bedroom door, calling out the
name ""Margherita."" She throws her coat over her nightgown and goes to
investigate. With bats squeaking over her head, Vera makes her way down
into the crypt, where she comes upon two coffins...one for Margherita
Kernassy and one for Gabor Kernassy. Suddenly, the Count appears, bares
his fangs, and sucks blood from Vera's neck. When Vera regains
consciousness, it is the next morning. The housekeeper informs her that
she has had a high fever and been delirious all night. Vera concludes that
her encounter with the Count in the crypt must have been a fever dream.
But when Vera sees the two holes in her neck, she realizes otherwise.
Immediately, she packs her bags and goes looking for her friends.The first person she meets is the Count. Vera hightails it away from
him. When the Count gives her chase, Vera opens a door to escape and runs
into...the Count. With Counts on both sides of her now, Vera faints. The
two Counts struggle. When the vampire Count knocks out the human Count, he
(the vampire Count) carries Vera down into the crypt and places her in
Margherita's coffin. Katia is jealous and vows to kill Vera before the
vampire Count can make Vera immortal. Not to be deprived of his Margherita
again, the vampire Count drives a burning stake through Katia's heart.Meanwhile, the human Count has followed them down into the crypt. He
informs the vampire Count that the serum is almost ready and that it will
put an end to the vampire affliction, but the vampire Count is not
interested. Indeed, he considers vampirism ""a significant achievement of
the intellect and the greatest joy known to mankind."" A little more
fighting breaks out, the end of which results in the human Count pulling
down the curtains and letting in the sunlight. In his struggle with the
light, the vampire Count impales himself on a poker and fades away. The
human Count carries Vera upstairs.Everyone is happy that the vampire Count is now dead. A short while
later, Vera and her friends drive off in their bus, leaving the human
Count behind to tie up a few loose ends at the castle, after which he plans
to join Vera. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks with a Circus,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054390/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Taken in by distant members of his family after being orphaned, Toby Tyler runs away to join the circus. In 1910, the arrival of Col. Sam Castle's Great American Circus captures the interest of young orphan Toby Tyler, who sneaks away from his uncle Daniel and aunt Olive's farm in order to watch the circus parade. Having only a penny, Toby must sample the show's many delights from afar, but attracts the attention of shyster concessionaire Harry Tupper, who seduces him with tales of the excitement of working for the circus. When Toby returns home, Daniel excoriates him for failing to feed the hogs, which stampeded and ruined the crops. Although Olive tries to calm Daniel, he tells Toby that he is nothing but a burden to them. Crushed, Toby runs away that night and finds Harry, who welcomes him aboard as his assistant. As the circus group packs to leave, Toby's dinner of one banana is stolen by chimpanzee Mr. Stubbs, and the commotion attracts the attention of Castle. The manager gruffly orders strongman Ben Cotter to take Toby with him atop his wagon, and although Ben glowers as if furious, he is secretly gentle and kind, and his songs help Toby sleep through the long night. In the morning, Toby follows Ben, prompting the other workers to tease the big man for his ""small shadow."" After threatening the men into silence, Ben puts a stop to Harry's habitual mistreatment of his helpers, throwing him in a pond after Harry shoves Toby. In the lunch-wagon, young bareback performer Mlle. Jeanette invites Toby to sit with her, but her partner, arrogant young M. Ajax, commands that he leave. The boy is soon rescued by clown Sam Treat, who insists that Toby join his ""family,"" which consists of five performing dogs. Upon hearing that Toby has run away and feels he cannot return until he has earned some money, Sam gives him a pouch in which to save his wages. On his first day of work, Toby dutifully sells candy, but is distracted by the acts such as dancing elephants and trapeze artists. Afterward, Harry ""generously"" allows him to keep one-third of his tips, but works the boy unremittingly. When Toby sets down a candy tray near Mr. Stubbs's cage, the animal eats the whole tray, soon falling ill. Toby brings him to Sam, who gives him castor oil and sends him to sleep with Toby, and a hesitant Ben allows the chimp atop the wagon as they travel that night. In the morning, a breakdown causes a delay, and to make up for lost time, they must parade directly through town before setting up their tents. The town is in the midst of a Fourth of July celebration, and the firecrackers frighten Mr. Stubbs, who jumps on the horses, causing them to rear, and the wagon to tumble over. The monkeys are loosed on the town, and although most are soon rounded up, Toby finds Mr. Stubbs in the sheriff's office, waving the lawman's pistol while the prisoners cower in fear. When a sharpshooter offers to kill the chimp, Toby runs into the office, approaching Mr. Stubbs gently until he can disarm him. Although Castle first fires Ben in a rage for allowing the chimp to topple the wagon, the publicity from Toby's brave rescue doubles the circus' profits, prompting Castle to demand that Toby and Mr. Stubbs travel on the wagon together from now on. Three weeks later, while Toby is watching Jeanette perform, her interest in him provokes Ajax's jealousy. The performer proceeds to show off, resulting in a broken leg. Castle is horrified to have to cancel the show until Jeanette announces that Toby told her he was a horseback rider, and Castle suggests that Ben teach the boy to take over for Ajax. Harry protests strongly, forcing Castle to pay him an extra $20 per week ""finder's fee"" for Toby's services. On the wagon that night, Toby confesses to Ben that he lied about his horsemanship to impress Jeanette, and Ben intimates that Toby has saved enough money to return home. Mr. Stubbs, however, empties Toby's pouch of coins while the boy sleeps, and in the morning Toby berates his friend. Ben gives Toby enough money to leave, but is pleased when the boy prefers to stay and face the challenges of performing. With only two weeks to train him, Ben is worried that Toby is hopeless, but by encouraging his competition with Ajax, Ben is able to drive Toby to succeed. Meanwhile, Harry has been confiscating letters to Toby from Aunt Olive describing their remorse and their need for Toby to return to help them with the failing farm. On the day of Toby's premiere, the performers present him with a new costume, and Jeanette kisses Toby for luck. Toby ties up Mr. Stubbs, but the chimp breaks free and finds Olive's most recent letter in Harry's coat pocket. Toby has no time to read it before his performance, during which Ben and Castle hold their breath, but the boy is a huge hit. Afterward, he races backstage to read the letter and immediately packs to leave, not knowing that Mr. Stubbs is following him. When Harry discovers that the boy has disappeared, he trails him in a car, announcing in town that a boy has run away with a valuable chimp. Meanwhile, Mr. Stubbs finds Toby in the nearby woods and the two proceed along together, but when a hunter happens upon them, Mr. Stubbs runs up in the tree, where the hunter mistakes him for quail and shoots him. Harry arrives to find Toby sobbing over the prone body of his friend, and after informing the boy that the accident was his fault, Harry brings him back to the camp. Toby runs straight to Castle to explain what has happened, and is shocked and pleased to find his aunt and uncle there looking for him. They apologize to Toby and embrace him, while outside, Ben, who has learned about the hidden letters, dumps Harry into a barrel. That night, Toby is sad at the loss of Mr. Stubbs until Sam reveals that the hunter has brought the chimp back, grazed but unharmed by the bullet. Toby and Mr. Stubbs hug joyfully. Toby then performs one last show as Olive and Daniel beam with pride, during which Mr. Stubbs makes a surprise appearance by jumping on Toby's back. The act is a huge success, and provokes Castle to declare ""M. Stubbs"" the new star of the show."

Cash McCall,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052680/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"James Garner put in a winning performance as a similarly unreconstructed capitalist in the grip of merger mania. Cash McCall is a young and slick business man who buys failing businesses and resells them. Grant Austen's Plastics is even more of a prize to Cash, for Cash is also making a bid for Austen's beautiful daughter, Lory. This is Cash's toughest deal ever.—Kelly In Philadelphia, Grant Austen, the founder and CEO of Austen Plastics, is being strong-armed by his primary customer, Schofield Instrument Corporation, largely a military supplier accounting for over half of Austen's business, to produce a new part requiring major investment with no guarantees on purchase numbers, or else they will take all their business to a competitor, it all, unaware to Austen, in a move to take over the company for a song in ruining Austen. It being the last straw in what has become him tiring of the rat race especially in not being inherently business-minded, Austen considers selling the company if he can find the right buyer who will meet his terms, that is without disclosing to the buyer or anyone else this issue with Schofield. Regardless, he will have to clear the issue with his young adult daughter, illustrator Lory Austen, the ten percent minority owner of the company, she who is still recovering from a romantic heartbreak last summer in Maine which she has not talked about to anyone in details. Independently, Austen's banker, Will Atherson, and Austen's business manager, Gil Clark of the management consulting firm of Corporate Associates which Austen has on retainer, find the same potential buyer, Cash McCall. What Atherson and Clark are aware of but do not pass along to Austen is that McCall is a proverbial vulture, who buys companies that are going through short term problems, only to turn around and make a profit in any way he can, usually selling for a tax loss, or decimating the company into unrecognizable pieces, again those individual components sold, with most employees as a result out of work. While he is under continual investigation by the authorities and regulators, nothing that McCall does in business is illegal, albeit seen as immoral or unethical. McCall does end up buying the company on Austen's terms, the purchase price well in excess of its true market value. It was only part way through the deal that Clark found out that he became aware of McCall as a potential buyer as McCall owns Corporate Associates. And what McCall has not divulged to anyone is that he bought the company solely to be close to Lory, as he was her Maine summertime romance. Regardless, with Clark's assistance, McCall is able to find a way to make substantial money on the deal. This financial windfall ends up putting McCall in both Scofield and Austen's cross-hairs who want to ruin him, Austen in believing that it was through collusion that he ended up with the company with this major profit. McCall is also facing some personal difficulties, as, as Lory has indeed fallen in love with him again this second time around, Maude Kennard, the Assistant Manager of the Ivanhoe Hotel, the renovated penthouse suite where McCall lives and does much of his business, is secretly in love with him and will do whatever to make sure no other woman is in his life in that romantic sense.—Huggo"

Testament of Orpheus,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054377/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Poet looks back over his life and work, recalling his inspirations and obsessions. The poet Jean Cocteau is lost in space-time. He has been in the 18th century and is now turning up at different moments in professor Langevin's life. The professor has invented some bullets, which travel faster than light. With one of them he kills Cocteau, who is resurrected as his old self, but is still caught in the space between fantasy and reality. At a gypsy camp a woman saves a photo out of the fire and restores it. On the photo Cocteau recognizes Cégeste from his film Orphée. He tears the photo into pieces and throws it into the sea. Immediately Cégeste himself jumps out of the water. He brings Cocteau to a rogatory commission led by Heurtebise and The Princess from the film Orphée. Cocteau admits that he has constantly attempted to enter a world which is not his own, a world that is beyond the limits of man, and that disobedience is like a religion for him. The commission imposes on him the sentence of life. In a hall inside some stone ruins the goddess Athena kills Cocteau with her spear. His friends assemble around his body, but he resurrects from death, and walks away along a small road. Cégeste comes out from a rock and draws Cocteau into it, because they don't belong to life on earth.—Maths Jesperson {maths.jesperson1@comhem.se} Perpetually haunted by the profound joy of art and creation,Jean Cocteau, as a white-haired 18th-century poet, makes a do-or-die effort to attain divinity and complete his journey of enlightenment. In his swan song, and the final part of The Orphic Trilogy--preceded byThe Blood of a Poet (1932)andOrpheus (1950)--the troubled poet swings back and forth through time, blurring the boundaries of life and death, the present and the future. As mythological creatures, obsessions, and fantasies mingle without chronological order, cryptic symbolism--embodied byYul Brynner,Pablo Picasso,Charles Aznavour, andJean-Pierre Léaud--brings everything full circle, composing the testament of Orpheus, the poet.—Nick Riganas From the Criterion Collection DVD Cover: ""In his last film, legendary writer/artist/filmmaker Jean Cocteau portrays an 18th century poet who travels through time on a quest for divine wisdom. In a mysterious wasteland, he meets several symbolic phantoms that bring about his death and resurrection. With an exlectic cast that indludes Pablo Picasso, Jean-Pierre Léaud, Jean Marrais, and Yul Brenner, 'Testament of Orpheus' (Le Testament d'Orphée) brings full circle the journey Cocteau began in 'The Blood of a Poet,' an exploration of the tortuous relationship between the artist and his creations.""The film opens with the final scene of Orphee (1950) - the previous film in this trilogy.The narrator (Cocteau) describes his film and cinema's relation to the audience in general.The scene cuts to a boy working at his desk as a man dressed in colonial attire materializes before him. He is searching for a professor and asks the boy if he is the professors son. The boy is not the son of a professor, but hopes to one day become a famous professor. The man vanishes in response leaving the boy stunned. He reappears only to retrieve his forgotten gloves. The same man then sneaks up and startles a woman causing her to drop her infant son. He worries he has muddled her destiny. This is his second encounter. His third encounter is with a frail old man being strolled in his wheelchair by a nurse. It's revealed this is the professor who as an infant was dropped on his head by his mother. The man vanishes just before the professor passes away. The professor drops a box of bullets that the man claims will set him free. (~6:50)The film cuts to the professor as a middle aged man resting between research. The same strange man appears before him who the professor recognizes from his youth as a boy. The man reveals he has been searching for the professor while lost in space-time, and it should be 2209, not 1959. He reveals the bullets he previously recovered from the older professor which the man reveals can travel faster the light and can save him because of that property. He wants to be shot. The professor shoots him causing him to fall downwards, then upwards now dressed as a modern man. He has become his modern self, Cocteau - the poet and film director of this trilogy. He leaves the professor's lab and walks down a dirt road. (~14:00)He has passes a man dressed in skin tight black wearing a horse head. They glance at one another after there is some distance between them. Cocteau follows the horse man into what appear to be stone ruins. In the ruins he finds a pow-wow of colony with a flamenco guitar player and various people mingling and sitting around a fire. From the flames a picture of Cegeste (a character in the film Orphee [1950]) is created which the professor recognizes, and is presented to a woman surrounded by followers who glare at Cocteau. The woman tears the photo into four and hands it to Cocteau. He leaves followed by the horse-man. Cocteau regrets following the horse-man. (~19:45)He approaches a cliff by the sea and tosses the photo into the ocean from which Cegeste springs to life. Cegeste has been removed from cinematic confines and is now real. He hands Cocteau a dead flower and asks that he follow him. They venture toward a lighthouse. (~21:20)A story of Nebuchadnezzar is recounted in a tapestry hanging on a wall. A young woman approaches a podium in front of the tapestry and is questioned by a man before her on Greek myth. He asks her about Cocteau as Cocteau and Cegeste approach. The two men pass through the area to arrive at a green house. Cocteau removes a painting from a canvass and begins to try to paint the dead flower to no avail. Cegeste (now wearing a skull mask) reveals, ""An artist always paints his own portrait. You'll never paint that flower"". Cocteau destroys the flower in rage, but Cegeste collects the pieces in a pot. Later, Cocteau reassembles the flower by hand. Cegeste demands Cocteau accompany him to the goddess Minerva (or Athena). Cocteau refuses initially causing Cegeste to lash out at him for events in Orpheus (1950). He places the skull mask on Cocteau forcing him to obey. They meet The Princess (Death) and Heurtebise from Orpheus (1950). (~31:50)The are on a council investigating Cocteau for attempting to travel to another world. He pleads guilty to all charges. Cocteau gives the panel the flower, but it disappears as they demand to know where it came form. Cocteau explains his philosophy of cinema and poetry to the panel as they question him. It is also revealed that Cegeste is actually a painter, and Cegeste is only a pseudonym. Cegeste reveals he was ordered to have Cocteau revive the flower, and it is asked of Cegeste to prove his other-worldly powers. He tells the panel they will have to take his word for it. The panel regresses to questioning Cocteau and summon the professor as witness against him. The professor credits Cocteau for enlightening him to other powers that finished his research, as he had earlier used his research to restore Cocteau to his own time period, though he now ended up in this undead timeless world. The professor asks to question the panel, but expresses a difficulty existing and vanishes. The Princess again questions Cegeste on his intentions, and wonders if he wished to split in two which would remove his unwanted traits. Cegeste claims no malcontent, and the professor adds he can think of no worse punishment than to remain in this middle realm. The panel leaves, but not before Heurtebise explains to Cocteau the outcome of Orpheus, Eurydice, and Hades while giving him back the flower. He also explains that for their interworldly crimes in the previous film, Heurtebise and The Princess are forced to be eternal judges of this world. Cegest and Cocteau come to an accord on their place with each other, and Cegeste reveals the flower holds the same destiny as Cocteau. (~51:35)The film cuts to a mansion with a countess outdoors speaking to her servant. The countess is able to see Cocteau and Cegeste approach, but the servant is not. She blows a whistle which commands a pair of men dressed in underwear and a skimpy Anubis costume to prance about for her. It is revealed by Cegeste that she is a woman in the wrong time era. They leave the mansion and venture to the sea where they board a sail boat. On the boat is Isolde who seeks Tristan. Cegeste and Cocteau dock and venture to a church that houses Cocteau's planned tomb. Cocteau encounters his living self briefly in passing. (~1:00:00)Cocteau and Cegeste continue where they find two intellectuals embracing one another in the ruins from the beginning of this movie.. They give two children their autographs who place the signatures in the mouth of a statue. Cegeste reveals the statue grants celebrity status to anyone for a brief moment. From its six mouths spew all forms of art such as poetry and songs. Cegeste leaves Cocteau but tells him that he is right where he left him. Cocteau explores and finds a man on the phone at a desk who asks Cocteau to wait a moment for the minister. After a very long wait, the man instructs Cocteau to proceed, but to first sign away all his hope. Cocteau approaches a pair of men dressed in black horse outfits, and a women dressed in hoplite attire as he finds the flower reappear in his hand. The hoplite has false eyes glazed by what appears as plactic in gloss.The hoplite and Cocteau stare at one another until the hoplite looks away. Cocteau asks to be excused, turns, and walks away. (~1:09:56)The Hoplite raises its javelin and throws it at Cocteau. It impales him through the upper back.He falls to his knees and falls onto a pile of rubble. The horse-men approach and pull the spear out from him. Onlookers view Cocteau being carried away by the horse-men. The flower now laying on the ground turns red - the first color seen in the film; the color matches the blood next to it. Cocteau's body is taken amongst the people who were watching and resurrected. He leaves the ruins. He walks away now having the same false eyes the hoplite had. He is followed by a spirit for some distance until passing by a man and a woman. (~1:16:49)Cocteau awakens on a road in a remote location from what he imagines is somnambulism. He recognizes the sounds of the motorcycles from his earlier film Orpheus (1950) and is certain that they have come to kill him as they killed Cegeste. As they question him Cegeste materializes and removes him from the scene claiming Earth is not his home any longer. The officers are left confused and stunned by this disappearance. An officer drops his notepad which turns into the flower before hitting the ground. (~1:19:10)Cocteau thanks the audience and says this is his farewell film. He hopes you enjoyed it.

A storm hits that cuts off all the power on the island, and within minutes, the rain melts the ice preserving the beasts, and they revive, fully functioning. While the caveman arises and runs into the jungle, the dinosaurs attack O'Leary, who manages to set off an explosion that alerts the islanders. Bart sends the islanders to the old fortress, which he plans to surround with a flaming moat.While his co-worker, Dumpy, drives the heavy equipment to create the moat, Bart and Betty rush to Betty's house to use her father's short-wave radio to call for help. Before they get there, however, the caveman stumbles into the home, scaring off Betty's mother and destroying the ham radio.Meanwhile, Julio wanders through the jungle, alarmed to see the Tyrannosaurus eating several locals but charmed by the gentle Brontosaurus. He then enters the Pipers' house and befriends the caveman, teaching him to eat with a fork. Hacker and his men, who have been searching for the caveman, enter the house and attack, but Julio and the caveman outwit their assailants together and escape into the jungle.By the time Bart and Betty reach the house, they spot Julio and the caveman riding away on the back of the Brontosaurus, and fearing for the boy's life, rush after him. Betty is soon seized by the Tyrannosaurus, but the caveman spears the dinosaur's foot until it releases her, then spirits her away into a mine shaft, pursued by Bart and Dumpy. While Betty tries to deflect the caveman's admiration by cooking for him, Bart spots the Tyrannosaurus attack the Brontosaurus. Julio jumps off its back but joins the fray by throwing rocks at the Tyrannosaurus. Just as the fiend turns its attention to Julio, the caveman snatches the boy and brings him into the mine shaft.At the same time that the Tyrannosaurus assails the mouth of the mine shaft, Hacker and his men reach the back of the mine, but when Hacker commands them to crawl in, his henchmen flee in terror. Hacker is forced to climb into the back of the mine himself, where he holds Betty, Julio and the caveman at gunpoint. The caveman tries to defend the trio, but Hacker shoots him in the arm, then prepares to offer Julio to the Tyrannosaurus as bait. Outside, Bart is able to throw a bomb into the dinosaur's mouth, temporarily hindering it. The animal's thrashing causes the mine to cave in, and when Hacker flees, he is killed by falling debris. Inside, the caveman heroically holds up the roof to allow Betty and Julio to escape, only to be crushed by its weight.As Bart leads Betty and Julio to the fortress, the Brontosaurus slips into quicksand. The Tyrannosaurus turns its attention to the fortress, where they have only enough fuel to light the moat for five minutes. Bart waits until the creature is near, then sets the fire, which keeps the Tyrannosaurus at a safe distance. With only moments of safety remaining, Bart jumps into a dump truck and attacks the creature. Although the struggle seems doomed, Bart finally triumphs and knocks the dinosaur over the cliff. As the creature sinks to the bottom of the ocean, the crowd cheers. Betty and Julio embrace Bart, who explains to the boy that the caveman would never be able to survive so unfamiliar an era. As the crowd disperses, a ship full of tourists arrives at the shore, blissfully anticipating a quiet island vacation."

Sunrise at Campobello,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054354/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a bout with polio, future presidentFranklin D. Rooseveltfights to save his political career. The story of Franklin Roosevelt's bout with polio at age 39 in 1921 and how his family (and especially wife Eleanor) cope with his illness. From being stricken while vacationing at Campobello to his triumphant nominating speech for Al Smith's presidency in 1924, the story follows the various influences on his life and his determination to recover - based on the award winning Broadway play of the same name.—Ed Lorusso In 1921, 'Franklin Delano Roosevelt', having been the losing vice-presidential candidate in the 1920 election, has few to no thoughts of re-entering politics, although he is still working tirelessly for the Democratic Party. That summer, he, his wifeEleanor Rooseveltand their five children are vacationing at their summer property on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, when he begins to have mobility problems with his legs. It is initially diagnosed as a minor medical problem, but is ultimately discovered to be infantile paralysis, also known as polio. Those around him must help him adjust to this physical disability, which they all hope is only temporary. But they must also help him discover what the paralysis means for his professional future. His mother, Sara Roosevelt, and his best friend and adviser, Louis Howe, are the most at odds with each other. Eleanor, on the other hand, must take over many of the public duties for her husband, which she feels ill equipped initially to handle. As the years pass and the paralysis remains, Franklin comes to the realization of his capabilities and he thinks of resurrecting his political career. These thoughts culminate at the 1924 Democratic presidential nomination convention, where Franklin must take the biggest ten steps of his life up to that point.—Huggo The story of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his battle to regain the use of his legs at the age of 39 after contracting polio. He was at his family summer house on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada when he contracted the disease with no known cure. By the time he contracted the disease in 1921, Roosevelt had a long history of public service and had run for Vice President on the Democratic ticket in 1920. He and those around him realized that any political ambitions he may have had would be dashed if he was unable to regain at least the partial use of his legs. When he's asked to nominate Al Smith at the Democratic convention in 1924 he realizes he will will have to walk 10 paces to the podium and then stand for 45 minutes. It marks his return to public life.—garykmcd During his family's stay at their estate on Campobello Island in the summer of 1921, unsuccessful vice-presidential candidateFranklin D. Rooseveltis diagnosed with polio and, with the help of wifeEleanor Rooseveltand close friendLouis Howe, battles his newfound disability. In the summer of 1921, Franklin Delano Roosevelt spends carefree months at his summer home on Campobello Island in New Brunswick, Canada with his wife Eleanor and their five precocious children. While enjoying the sunset on 10 August, he loses strength in his legs and falls. By sunrise, he has fallen again and a specialist later diagnoses the problem as infantile paralysis or poliomyelitis. Word of Franklin's debility brings to the island his close friend and shrewd advisor, Louis McHenry Howe, who has an almost mystical belief that Franklin's political career is ""ordained.""A couple weeks later, Franklin's mother, Sara Delano, an overbearing widow who finds the asthmatic Louie's dry humor and unpretentious conversation vulgar, arrives from overseas. Louie is a source of comfort and stability for Eleanor, who has been Franklin's only nurse on the understaffed island, and he is able to assure the oldest son, James, of his father's ability to win tough battles. However, with the domineering Sara, who obviously dislikes him, Louie can manage only the civilities and refuses to discourage Franklin from public service and ""grandiose schemes,"" as she wishes. Franklin, despite his secret despair, continues to plan for a busy future and Louie orders Franklin's secretary, Missy Le Hand, to believe in him.At the end of the summer, the time when the family usually returns to New York, Franklin is still bedridden and the press is staking out the area, clamoring to see evidence of his weakened condition. To protect Franklin's reputation, Louie arranges for his departing family to serve as a decoy to lure the press away from Franklin, who is transported separately by stretcher to a different ferry. Afterward, Louie releases a confident announcement about Franklin's expected recovery, while Franklin is hospitalized for several months. After returning to his home in New York City, Franklin is fitted into leg braces, puts wheels on a chair and invents other gadgets to help him go about his daily tasks, in the belief that he will someday completely recover. With the help of Missy and Louie, Franklin maintains a public presence through correspondence, providing support for Woodrow Wilson's efforts toward world peace. Although he keeps actively engaged in the affairs of the world, he confides to Eleanor that he feels lonely and has nightmares about being trapped in a fire. To her surprise, he explains that he is teaching himself to crawl. Perceiving ""fire"" as a symbol of his trials, he believes that there is a reason he must endure them and that by having ""to crawl before he can walk"" again, he is learning humility. Hoping the news will lift his spirits, Louie reports that the New York Democratic Party is considering him for candidacy for governor, and Louie coaches Eleanor to be Franklin's ""eyes, ears and legs"" in the world by delivering speeches that he writes.Meanwhile, Franklin continues to pursue his many private interests, such as the Boy Scouts and the possibility of implementing air travel by dirigible. Claiming that the doctors have ordered Franklin to cut back on his activities, Louie urges Franklin to drop some of his organizations and interests in order to focus on upcoming Congressional elections, telling him that he should ""let the people know"" through his writing that he is a man of opinions and convictions. When Franklin crawls up the stairs to take a nap, Eleanor sees it as a small triumph of personal independence, but Sara is concerned about appearances. After Sara insists on trying to force her will on Franklin, Eleanor goes off alone to cry. Although Louie reassures her that she deserves a good cry, Eleanor announces that she ""will never do that again.""In July 1923, the family is summering at Hyde Park, where Franklin, much recovered but still unable to walk, roughhouses with his sons. He tells Eleanor that he now feels ""sure-footed,"" and that Eleanor's public appearances, Louie's ""shenanigans"" and his own written statements have kept ""his head above water."" In a private moment, Franklin and Eleanor, who are distant cousins, discuss with amusement how their respective families opposed their marriage. Franklin believes that he made the better bargain and admits that he was too haughty in his younger years. Eleanor confides that she was an awkward adolescent who felt unloved, until Franklin made her feel ""needed."" Their daughter Anna, who has been unhappy and rebellious, abruptly interrupts their conversation. When Eleanor confronts her, Anna admits she feels left out, and she, Eleanor and Franklin agree that they need to talk to one another more often.In January 1924, the family is back in New York City, where Eleanor is gaining confidence as a public speaker. The controlling Sara, who considers politics ""tawdry,"" urges Franklin to live a quiet life of luxury at the family's Hyde Park mansion and to give up trying to make the world the ""same for all people."" She reminds him that the wealthy serve the world through noblesse oblige , but he retorts that the idea is another name for indifference. An argument ensues, in which she supports herself by claiming that his cousin, President Theodore Roosevelt, died because of ambition of the people around him, but Franklin will discuss the matter no more. He becomes more determined to lift himself out of the chair and walk with crutches. For the upcoming presidential election, a Catholic, Governor Alfred E. Smith, is hoping to run as the Democratic candidate, but must first combat strong anti-Catholic bias. Guessing that Smith might ask the highly respected, ""Protestant, dry and rural"" Franklin to make the nominating speech at the Democratic Convention, Louie suggests that doing so is a way for Franklin to prove to the world that he has a political future. However, Louie concedes, that there is the chance that Franklin could fail, because, as Eleanor points out, the speaker must be able to stand before the crowd for at least forty-five minutes. Franklin admits that, if asked, he ""would have to go into training"" to be able to walk to the lectern and stand that long. When Smith visits Franklin, after some seemingly idle conversation to determine Franklin's physical ability and political opinions, he asks Franklin to make the nominating speech. After Smith leaves, Franklin arranges to get a blueprint of the area of Madison Square Garden where the convention will be held, and he and Louie estimate that he will need to walk on crutches ten steps to the podium. ""Work hard,"" Louie advises. ""They're liable to be the biggest ten steps you ever took in your life."" On the night of the convention, Franklin has James roll his wheelchair near the podium, having joked to his son earlier that if he falls, ""be sure to pick me up in a hurry."" After the chair comes to a stop, Franklin uses his hands to place his braced legs into position and then rises, as the hall becomes quiet. He walks the ten steps with deliberation and when he arrives at the podium and hands James his crutches, the crowd cheers."

Holiday in Spain,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054271/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Vacationing Englishman Oliver Larker stumbles upon a plot to kill a young American tourist in Spain. While touring Spain, Englishman Oliver Larker (Denholm Elliott) is rescued from the teasing of local children by friendly cab driver Smiley (Peter Lorre). Hiring Smiley to drive him on a sight-seeing tour, Oliver is captivated by an attractive woman in a white, wide-brimmed hat walking down a side street.After stopping at a shop, the unknown woman proceeds down an alley, apparently unaware of a speeding truck bearing down behind her that is deflected when Smiley's cab accidentally turns in front of it. Annoyed by the excited crowd that gathers to discuss the near accident, Oliver steps into the street where he is approached by Johnny Gin (Liam Redmond), the neighborhood drunk, who insists that he witnessed the event and believes the mysterious woman was targeted by the truck. His curiosity piqued, Oliver visits the shop where the woman stopped and asks the proprietor if he might examine the most recently cashed checks.While Oliver is searching for the women who stopped at the shop, Johnny Gin is questioned by Baron Saradin (Paul Lukas), another witness to the near accident, and their interview is watched by a dark-haired American man (Peter Arne). Oliver tracks down the flirty Miss Jordan (Diana Dors) and an ebullient artist, Miss Leonard (Judith Furse), but he is disappointed that neither physically matches the woman in the white hat. Oliver then finds Sally Kennedy (Beverly Bentley) at her hotel, and, discovering a wide-brimmed, white hat in her closet, is convinced that she is the near victim and offers her his protection. Although grateful, Sally insists that her brother lives nearby and will defend her against any threats.Resuming his tour with Smiley, Oliver proceeds to a scenic vista where he sees Johnny Gin wandering down a narrow street far below. As Oliver watches through his binoculars, three large casks of wine are mysteriously pushed onto the street and roll toward the older man, who desperately tries to outrun them. Panicked, Oliver and Smiley hurry down to the alley but by the time they arrive, Johnny Gin is dead.Concluding that Johnny's murder indicates Sally is in real danger, Oliver orders Smiley to return to her hotel where they see her driving away in a rented red sports car. The pair trail in the cab, unaware that another car, driven by the mysterious American, is following them. After the cab suffers a flat tire and Smiley stops to repair it, Oliver hurries up a nearby hill to follow through his binoculars Sally's progress along the winding roads. Hidden on an opposite hill, Saradin fires rifle shots at Oliver.At the hilltop hotel, Villa Flora, Oliver discovers that the last guest to check in was ""Constance Walker."" Deducing that Sally has checked in under an assumed name, Oliver and Smiley wait in the bar, unaware that Saradin is already there, as is the American. When a woman (BIllie Miller) answering to ""Miss Walker"" appears at the bar, Oliver is dismayed that she is not Sally.Upon exploring the hotel grounds, Oliver is confronted by a man who identifies himself as Tommy Kennedy (Leo McKern), Sally's brother. Tommy firmly asserts that his sister is on a cruise and not expected to arrive until the next day. Certain that Sally is on the property, Oliver continues searching and soon finds the red convertible covered by a tarp. After spotting a blonde in a nearby cottage, Oliver makes a dangerous climb to the cottage's balcony which hangs over a cliff. Inside, Oliver is attacked and after a brief skirmish knocks out his assailant, the American. The man revives and tells Oliver and the anxious Sally that he is Richard Fleming, a lawyer and executor of a trust for Sally which designates she will be given three million dollars at the end of the next day, her 25th birthday. Fleming adds that if Sally should die before midnight of the following day, Tommy will receive the inheritance. Excited to have found a motive for the threat against Sally, Oliver maintains that she must be escorted to a safe place. Fleming agrees and Oliver and Smiley drive all night with Sally to Seville, where they hope to lose themselves in the crowds gathered for a fiesta.That afternoon, the trio is shot at while walking and, declaring that she cannot put them at further risk, Sally dashes away. Oliver goes after her and the couple is nearly struck by a rock slide started by Saradin, who has pursued them. Returning to the cab, the trio sets off into the countryside, but when Sally dabs on a bit of perfume, Oliver grows suspicious. When the cab stalls, Oliver accuses Sally of being an impostor as the perfume does not match the ""Scent-of-Mystery"" perfume he learned Sally Kennedy prefers. Startled, Sally pulls a gun, orders the men from the car and steals the cab.On a nearby hillside, Saradin sees the cab and shoots out a tire, causing the cab to plunge over the mountainside with the Sally impostor still inside to her death. Saradin then chases Oliver and Smiley, firing at them as they hurry through a cave and over steep, narrow passages. Darting into a train tunnel, Oliver and Smiley just avoid a speeding train which kills Saradin.Wondering if Fleming is aware that Sally was a fraud, Oliver determines to find the lawyer, and he and Smiley walk into a local village where they meet an Englishman. Upon learning that Oliver is ""Lucky"" Larkin, a famed WW II flyer, the man happily loans him his airplane, which Oliver flies back toward the Villa Flora. On the flight, Oliver spots Tommy's van headed toward another town and trails him, landing the airplane near an ancient fortress, Tommy's destination.Oliver notices with a start that a woman in a white hat is waiting in one of the fortress towers and fears Tommy is about to murder his sister. Seeing Fleming's car pull up nearby, Oliver and Smiley are relieved, but when Smiley fills and lights his pipe, the scent causes Oliver to race after the lawyer and knock him out. Oliver then explains to the startled Tommy that Smiley's distinctive American tobacco blend, given him by Fleming at the hotel, matched a scent of smoke he smelled at the truck accident scene. The men then notice a tow truck pulling Smiley's battered cab into the village and Tommy identifies the bruised ""Sally"" as Fleming's long-time girl friend. Sadly speculating that his wife Margharita, who knew about Sally's trust and was a friend of Saradin's, was likely the motivator behind the plot to get Sally's inheritance, Tommy then takes Oliver to the tower to meet his grateful sister (Elizabeth Taylor) for the first time."

Det. Dave Kennedy is investigating a series of young, attractive women committing various forms of disfiguring self-mutilation, in each case the victim stating that she entered into the activity thinking she was doing something else perfectly normal, only to become aware of reality when the pain of the mutilation woke her out of whatever she was otherwise thinking. The case becomes more urgent as the latest victim, the eleventh, died from her injuries. The case turns personal with the twelfth victim, Dodie Wilson, being a friend of his. Dave's girlfriend, Marcia Blaine, believes that what happened to Dodie and the other victims has something to do with Desmond, a hypnotist, the three of them having attended his stage show just prior to what happened to Dodie. Marcia's belief is due to Dodie being brought on stage and featured, under hypnosis, in the final segment of the show. While Dave does believe that people can be hypnotized, he is less than convinced about Marcia's belief as he doesn't think what Desmond does is true hypnotism in the speed that everything happens in the show. Dave's colleague, police psychologist Phil Hecht, tries to convince him otherwise, he further having the view that such hypnosis especially dangerous when cloaked in the form of entertainment. Regardless, Marcia decides to do her own investigation on Desmond against Dave's wants, she playing a dangerous game if she is indeed correct about Desmond's involvement no matter the motive.—Huggo The city is stricken by a wave of self-mutilations performed by beautiful women who seem to be in a hypnotic trance. The authorities suspect a stage hypnotist with a popular act, but the stakes are raised when the hypnotist sets his sights on the girlfriend of the detective investigating the case. What is the hypnotist's secret, and why does it seem to involve his beautiful assistant?—acidxian The movie opens in a darkened room. An attractive young woman, Miss Thompson (Evan MacNeil) walks in carrying a bottle in her right hand and towel in the other. She turns on the light and we see it is the kitchen. She pours some of the white creamy liquid from the bottle into her hand, then lathers her hair. She turns on the stove and we see the flame from below the burner grate. Her hair catches fire and she screams. Title and credits roll.The woman's head is now bandaged and she is on a gurney, still in her kitchen. The Emergency Doctor (Jimmy Lydon) finishes some notes as the ambulance attendants prepare to move Miss Thompson to the hospital. Det. Sgt. Dave Kennedy (Joe Patridge) arrives on scene and removes the gawking neighbors from the kitchen doorway. He confers with the doctor and discovers, ""Another self-inflicted mutilation, the stove."" Dave tries to question the woman, but she just rambles then dies of shock. The count is now eleven women who have mutilated themselves.At police headquarters, Dave Kennedy reviews the grisly clues in some of the mutilations: a desktop fan, a coffee cup, and a straight razor. He decides to confer with Dr. Phillip Hecht, the police psychiatrist. Phil has to write a paper for the Journal of Criminal Psychiatry and is trying to find a topic. Dave is stumped by the cases and discusses the latest. Dave tells Phil he has a date with his girlfriend later and she wants to see a hypnotist show. Phil hates the idea of hypnotism, a legitimate medical tool being used for amusement and entertainment, ""They prostitute the entire science of hypnosis.""Desmond (Jacques Bergerac), dressed in formal wear, white tie and tails, is on stage with four men sitting in chairs. The subjects are under hypnosis and are given various commands: one man can't open his eyes, another told he is hot, a third is told he is cold, and the last man is told he is a mean dog. Dave is in the audience with his girlfriend, Marcia Blaine (Marcia Henderson). Sitting next to her is Marcia's friend, Dodie Wilson (Merry Anders). Dodie is impressed by Desmond's act, but Dave voices his skepticism. For the final act, Desmond calls for three female volunteers. Justine (Allison Hayes) joins Desmond on stage for the final act. She nods her approval of the women chosen. Dodie volunteers to be the third woman selected. The last demo is the defiance of the law of gravity. Desmond hypnotizes Dodie, then pushes her back into the arms of one of the volunteers. Dodie is floating when Desmond whispers something into her ear while Justine observes just off stage. Before Dodie is awakened, Desmond tells her, ""Now when you awake, you will not remember anything that has happened to you on this stage...You will remember only the order I gave you."" As Dave, Marcia and Dodie exit the theater, Dodie tells her friends she remembers nothing. Upon seeing the theatrical poster of Desmond, Dodie's mood changes and she grows cold and distant. She makes an excuse to go home and pretends to take a cab home, but actually goes back to see Desmond. Dodie is now at home preparing for bed. She fills the bathroom sink with water and pours liquid into the sink. After she pours most of the bottle into the sink we see it is a bottle of concentrated sulphuric acid. She proceeds to wash her face, then looks up at herself in the mirror. Her face is scarred and gray. She faints, knocking the bottle of acid on the floor.The Los Angeles Chronicle newspaper headline reads, ""12th Mutilation Victim,"" and ""Acid-Burned Beauty Found Unconscious."" A doctor (Fred Demara) is spraying a paraffin based solution on Dodie's back. Dave and Marcia come to visit her in the hospital. Before she will allow her friends in to see her she asks the doctor to turn the light away. Dodie pleads, ""Dave, what happened? Tell me what happened last night."" She tries her best to remember, but is unable to account for the acid. Dave and Marcia leave the hospital. Dave tells Marcia all the victims, including Dodie, tell the same story. Marcia suspects the only clue worth investigating is the hypnosis angle. Dave gets an emergency call on the car radio and departs. He leaves Marcia off at the hypnotist theater at her suggestion. They agree to meet at her apartment later that evening. Marcia volunteers for the three woman anti-gravity act. Desmond hypnotizes her. Desmond uses a flashing ""eye""--a strobe light. At Phil's apartment, Marcia tells Dave, ""He did it, I'm sure he did it."" She recounts the details of the show with Dave and Phil, including a detailed description of the ""eye"" prop. The final detail she discloses is that Desmond's whispered command was to return to the theater at midnight for a date. The three drive to the theater and Marcia goes back to see Desmond. Marcia waits in Desmond's dressing room. While there, she discovers the box with the ""eye"" and opens it. As it strobes, Desmond hypnotizes her again. They depart for dinner. Justine is waiting outside and hears Marcia give her address. Dave and Phil follow the couple, who've just departed in a cab. First dinner, and a dessert of flaming cherries jubilee. Next on the evening's agenda is a poetry reading at a coffee house where we are treated to the poetic talents of the King of the Beatniks (Lawrence Lipton) accompanied on bongo drums by Eric ""Big Daddy"" Nord (himself). Afterwards, Marcia and Desmond dance while Dave fumes to Phil. Marcia and Desmond take a cab to Marcia's apartment. Desmond goes in, but he doesnt stay long. Hidden in the bedroom, Justine enters the living room, breaking up the scene of Marcia and Desmond kissing. Justine reveals her part in the game, but not the reason. When Desmond asks, ""How many more?"" Justine replies, ""As long as there are faces like this."" Desmond departs and Justine takes over the hypnotic commands. She draws Marcia to the shower and scalding hot water. Dave wants to leave the scene after he notices Desmond leave, but Phil convinces him to stay and talk to Marcia. Before Marcia steps into the shower, Dave interrupts Justine's plan by knocking on the door. Justine lies to Dave and tells him that she and Marcia are old friends from school. Justine awakens Marcia with commands to go along with her story. Dave questions Marcia in the living room. Justine, in the bedroom, senses danger and leaves through the window before Dave can talk to her again. After Justine's departure Marcia returns to herself. They embrace and kiss.Phil is at home relaxing. He is playing the piano with his dog sitting on top of same. He is wearing a silk, Japanese-style, robe. Dave is outside his door. He picks up the newspaper and rings the bell. Dave confides that he is worried about his girlfriend, ""Marcia's changed, she's different. I've never seen her like she was last night."" Phil reassures Dave that Marcia's behavior is directly related to her hypnosis. Dave relays the story about the presence of Justine. He describes her as ""a real odd-ball."" Dave admits that he didn't buy the Justine story. Dave is now convinced that there is a connection with Desmond and the mutilations. He tells Phil he will interview all the women and ask just three questions: 1) Have you ever been hypnotized? 2) Have you ever seen a hypnotist named Desmond? 3) Does the name Justine mean anything?Dave and Phil pay a call on Mrs. McNear (an uncredited Phyllis Cole), she stuck her face into the blades of an electric fan. The woman refuses to answer the door, but speaks to them through a window. Dave asks his three questions, but all the responses are to the negative. In an agitated state she orders the pair off her property. Dave and Phil walk back to the car. Mrs. McNear opens the curtains to watch them leave. We see her badly scarred face. Their next call is to a woman who drank lye. She responds to the questions in writing, indicating, ""I swallowed lye thinking it was coffee. Never been hypnotized."" Their next call is to a woman sitting in a darkened room. Her face is scarred. She, like the others, gives the same answers, no, to all the questions. Doris Scott (Carol Thurston) asks for a cigarette. Dave gives her the pack, and retrieves matches from her purse and finds a balloon from the Desmond show. Dave pockets the balloon and lights her cigarette. The glow of the match reveals the woman has no eyes. Once outside, Dave blows up the balloon and confirms it is a part of Desmond's show. He thinks she may be lying, but Phil reminds him that she may not remember as a result of the hypnosis. Phil and Dave decide to ask Dodie the three questions.Her face now wrapped in gauze bandages, Dodie listens to the doctor explain that multiple plastic surgeries await her but the result will be excellent. While Dave asks Dodie his questions, Phil talks to Dodie's doctor. Dodie, like all the others, replies in the negative to all three questions. When asked about Justine, the doctor volunteers that, ""When she was admitted, she repeated that name several times. It seems to terrify her."" Phil asks permission to hypnotize Dodie, but the doctor advises against it.Waiting outside Marcia's apartment, Phil suggests they may learn more when he hypnotizes Marcia to relive her experience with Desmond. Marcia is not in her apartment, so Dave and Phil drive over to the theater. Marcia is back in the audience. Desmond invites the audience to participate in a mass demonstration, ""And now I am going to demonstrate to you the power of your own mind."" Justine walks on stage with a knife and lemon on a tray. Desmond suggests that their mouth begin to water from the, ""sour and bitter lemon."" He takes them through a series of physical movements using their arms and hands. After the balloon trick, he pulls the strobe ""eye"" out of his pocket, ""And now, if you dare, look into the hypnotic eye."" A woman screams which occurs just as Dave and Phil enter the theater from the back. They spot Marcia near the front of the theater. Justine implores Desmond to stop them. Desmond tries his suggesting voice to stop Dave and Phil, but it does not work. Justine pulls Marcia backstage and up the stairs to the catwalks over the stage. Dave and Desmond struggle briefly over a gun, but Phil stops Desmond. Dave rushes to Marcia, but Justine has taken them both to a swinging section of catwalk. When Phil threatens to shoot, Justine defiantly invites the confrontation promising to take Marcia with her. Phil tries to reason with Justine, explaining that she is young and has a life ahead of her. Justine screams, ""What kind of life? What kind of life with my face?"" Phil is confused, as Justine is an exceptionally beautiful woman. She reveals her secret, ""If you like my face so much, you may have it."" At that she pulls off a mask and throws it down to Phil revealing a horribly scarred visage. Phil is distracted, allowing Desmond to get the upper hand. Justine pleads for Desmond to kill Phil, but Dave pulls his gun and kills Desmond. Justine either falls or jumps to her death, landing next to the body of her partner in crime, Desmond. This leaves Marcia dangling high above the stage with Dave trying to pull her back to safety. Marcia wakes and assists with her own rescue. Now safe, Marcia and Dave exit the catwalk. We close with Phil walking out on stage to warn the audience. ""Ladies and Gentlemen, a word of warning. Hypnosis, although an important and valuable medical tool, can be extremely dangerous when improperly used by untrained or unscrupulous practitioners. Therefore, never allow yourself to be hypnotized by anyone who is not a medical doctor or has not been recommended to you by your doctor. Not even in a motion picture theater. Thank you."""

La sombra del Caudillo,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054321/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The movie situated in post-revolutionary Mexico describes the way politics were done in those times. Ignacio Jimenez is chosen as the candidate of the Partido Radical Progresista, but he isn't so sure about it, because he knows his boss,El Caudillo has chosen another candidate. Several political moves are done between the parties, leading to a thunderous climax.—Marcos Villaseor The movie is based on the 1926 novel by the same title of Martin Luis Guzman (18871976), the renown Mexican writer. It is based on real facts. It narrates the history of the presidential succession in Mexico during the 1920' s. The Minister of War, General Aguirre, is being pressured into running for President, but he knows that the incumbent President, el Caudillo, has another candidate in mind, General Jimenez. Accepting the candidacy will pit his ambition against his loyalty. All the characters, except Axkana Gonzalez, are based on real people. The Caudillo is in reality Alvaro Obregon, President of Mexico from 1920 to 24. Ignacio Aguirre, the Minister of War, is a mixture of Adolfo de la Huerta, provisional president for a couple of months in 1920, and General Francisco Serrano, assassinated along with his followers in 1927. Hilario Jimenez (the Minister of the Interior) was in real life Plutarco Elías Calles, President of Mexico from 1924 to 28. This movie was censured for 30 years. Its director, Julio Bracho, died in 1978 without being able to see his wonderful work.

Bombai Ka Babu,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053629/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Babu and Malik are two inseparable friends who live in a small town in India. One day they decide to play a prank and steal something. They get caught, while Malik's dad come to bail out and stand surety for him, Babu has no one to do so and ends up in the juvenile center. When the two grow up, Malik becomes a Police Inspector, while Babu takes to crime and ends up being sentenced in jail. When he gets discharged, he goes to meet with his partner-in-crime, Bali, and together they start planning the next heist. Malik meets with Babu and tells him to go straight, but Babu had already tried that and ended up being falsely accused of stealing a necklace belonging to his employer's wife. Nevertheless, Babu does inform Bali that he will not be taking part in any crime. Thereafter, Bali and his men are arrested, and blame Babu for ratting on them. Bali is released on bail, Babu meets with him, an argument ensues, leading to a physical fight, with Bali getting killed. A fearful Babu flees from Bombay straight to Jogendranagar in Northern India, where he meets with a man named Bhagat who asks him to masquerade as Kundan, the sole heir of a wealthy man named Shahji. When Babu refuses, Bhagat threatens to notify the Police. Babu becomes Kundan, makes his way into the hearts of Shahji, his wife, Rukmani, and daughter, Maya. Babu gets enough cash to pay off Bhagat in small installments, but Bhagat becomes more and more demanding and wants Babu to steal all the cash and jewelry and abscond. Babu is reluctant to steal from these kind people, and to make matters worse has fallen in love with Maya - his 'sister'. Caught between a rock and a hard place - no matter what move Babu makes - he will surely end up trapping himself - not only with Bhagat, his newfound family, as well as the police - who are now hot on his trail.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) I consider Bombai Ka Babu as Raj Khosla Ji's best work. It didn't bring home the bacon in terms of the box office receipts but if you view it from an art lover's prism, it stands out as a fine piece of cinematic experience.
Babu (Dev Anand) is a petty criminal in Mumbai who accidentally kills Bali ( Jagdish Raj). As Babu runs away from the law, he is blackmailed by an unscrupulous person Bhagat who sends him to Shahji( Nazir Hussain) to impersonate as his lost in the childhood son Kundan. Nazir Hussain and his wife Achla Sachdev get a fresh lease of life when they unite with their son ( though he is an impostor). Their daughter Maya (Suchitra Sen) is also very happy. As the hero knows that heroine is not his sister, he falls in love with her. Towards the end of the movie, the heroine also comes to know that hero is not her brother. She has feelings for him which are expressed in a very subtle way when the hero loses a game of chess, his parents say- ye haar gaya, but the heroine says- ye hara nahi ye jeet gaya.The hero and heroine know that they are not siblings , and they have feelings for each other too, but they cannot unite. The heroine cannot afford to disillusion her parents who are under the impression that the hero is their son. The hero also accepts the responsibility particularly when he comes to know the one whom he killed( Jagdish Raj) was the real son of the family.' Ye Mera Ghar Hai', the hero tells the villain when he threatens to expose him. In spite of the hero and heroine loving each other, it is a very mature ending with the heroine marrying the man her parents have chosen for her and the hero continuing as the family's son, and the climax song-chal ri sajni ab kya soche- reflect that they have decided to move on.
A very bold theme for 1960 when the norm was that the hero and heroine should get married in the last reel no matter what. Superb treatment by the director Raj Khosla which places him in the top bracket of Hindi film directors. Great music by Sachin Da, and the beautiful locations of Himachal Pradesh add the icing to the cake.Such was the charm of Dev Anand and Suchitra Sen that the then Chief Minister of Punjab Shri Pratap Singh Kairon came to watch the shooting (Himachal was part of Punjab at that time). Initially, Madhubala was the heroine but because of her failing health she was replaced by Suchitra Sen who looks breathtakingly beautiful and has also given an outstanding performance as an actor. We should also admire Rashid Khan's performance- I think it is his best, next only to Teesri Manzil.
The lovers of Bollywood classics can watch this movie again and again."

Shortly thereafter, a money-lender named Dhaniram is killed. A man, Kaalia, is arrested by the police, is in custody and is accused of killing Dhaniram. But Kaalia claims that he only went to rob Dhaniram's house, and did not kill him. Advocate Kailash Khanna comes to the defense of Kalidas and enters a plea of not guilty on his behalf. Kailash is the prospective son--in-law of Judge Prasad as he is in love with his daughter, Meena. Throughout the proceedings, Kailash closely watches Judge Prasad as the Public Prosecutor goes on lay evidence upon evidence to prove that it was Kaalia who killed Dhaniram. Then when Khanna's turn comes, he points his finger accusingly at Prasad and accuses him of killing Dhaniram. There is furore in the Courtroom and subsequently in the media, as Prasad steps down and lets Jha take over the proceedings. Then there is a sudden turn of events when suddenly Kaalia informs the Court that it was he, and he alone that killed Dhaniram. It is now up to Khanna to decide to wean the truth out of this matter, or just accept the turn of events and carry on with this life.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) All law is based on human evidence, and since human beings are what they are, their evidence cannot be infallible. Is it therefore justifiable to take the life of one man on the evidence of another? Judge Badri Prasad (Ashok Kumar) has a son, Vijay, and a daughter, Meena, who is engaged to a Public Prosecutor, Kailash Khanna (Rajendra Kumar). Being extravagant, Vijay gets into debt with Dhaniram, a vicious moneylender. Unable to tell his father, he goes to Meena and asks her to send Kailash to plead with Dhaniram, which she does. However, as Kailash arrives at the moneylender's house, he spots the Judge approaching; this being a delicate matter, he hides himself. But to his horror, he witnesses the Judge murdering Dhaniram - and to make matters worse, a petty thief who just happens to be around is arrested for the crime! Kailash, dumbfounded to see that the thief's trial takes place in Judge Prasad's court itself, decided to defend the innocent man. But now he is faced with the dilemma of trying to save the innocent thief's life; but at the same time knowing who the real murderer is, but being unable to expose him.—Q. Leo Rahman"

Before leaving, Cleopatra entrusted her young daughter, Shila, to the rulers of Assyria to be brought up as their own. After Marc Antony's defeat and Cleopatra's death, Egypt, for the next twenty years, was torn apart and ruled by a youthful Pharaoh, Nemorat, with his despot Queen Mother, Tegi, who desired to unite both kingdoms and strengthen her son's rule by conquering Assyria and making Shila, now a beautiful woman, his queen.—Artemis-9 Shila, Cleopatra's daughter was left in Assyria for safety, in care of the King and Queen of Assyria during the war with Rome but now 20 years later, unknown to her, her mother and father are dead. The young hypochondriatic Pharoah Nemorat, has been ruling Egypt with his mother queen Tigi, but now she feels it is time he should be married. Nemorat wanted to conquer Assyria but Tegi thought it would be a better idea if he married Shila because she thought it was about time he married. It would also legitimize his claim to the throne because of Shila's lineage and the combination of Egypt and Assyria would make a stronger united country. Shila finally agrees to marry Nemorat only if her people who are imprisoned by the Egyptians can go free. But she reacts in horror when told of her parents and brother's deaths. Resi, the Pharaoh's court doctor, gently consoles her. Over time Shila eventually falls in love with Resi and when Nemorat dies, in his dying breath he accuses Shila of killing him and tells her he wants her to be buried alive with him in his newly completed pyramid. But Resi is already making plans to help her.—bcarruthers-76500 After the death of Antony and Cleopatra Egypt is ruled by the young tyrant Pharaoh Nemorat and his mother Tegi. Cleopatra has left a surviving daughter, Shila, raised by the king and queen of Assyria. When Nemorat conquers Assyria, Shila is brought to the Egyptian court; and, at the instigation of Nemorat's mother, marries the pharaoh. The pharaoh, who is a mentally disturbed hypochondriac, has a good and wise physician, Resi, who falls in love with Shila, and encourages her to go on living despite the killing of her Assyrian surrogate parents by Tegi. When Shila spurns an amorous Nemorat one evening, he goes into a violent rage causing him to faint. He is then poisoned by his ambitious chief overseer Kefren and his mistress. Shila is convicted of the murder and is sentenced to be buried alive with Nemorat. Resi comes up with a plan to save Shila by having her take a drug, which causes her to lapse into a temporary coma, while he bribes the chief of the ""house of death"" to allow him to take Shila away in the dead of night. The chief of the house of death proves treacherous by not allowing Resi to rescue Shila, but in a struggle with Resi he is killed. Resi, though, is seriously wounded and is rescued and tended by his faithful servant, but he does not recover before Shila is entombed with Pharaoh Nemorat. The common people, who have benefited from Resi's kind care of them, aid him in capturing the royal architect, who helps Resi and his associates, greedy tomb robbers, to break into Nemorat's tomb and save Shila. Shila and Resi ride off in freedom while Kefren gets his just desserts when Tegi finds out that he really poisoned Nemorat: he is killed by the palace guards.This film was probably intended to be a story about a New Kingdom (1570-1070 BC) pharaoh rather than a Ptolemaic one (30 BC). The costumes are New Kingdom, and the nation of Assyria was destroyed in the 6th century BC before the rise of Rome. The English translation of the Italian title is ""Sepulchre of the King."""

Ten Who Dared,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054372/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Major John Wesley Powell leads an expedition through the Grand Canyon to chart the Colorado River. By 1869, most of the USA had already been mapped and charted with the exception of the Colorado River region. Therefore, the U.S. government sends geologist and ex-Union Army Major John Wesley Powell to map it. Major Powell, who's missing a hand since the Civil War, needs assistants but trustworthy skilled men are hard to find after the war. The Major has to accept any volunteer he can find and he assembles a team of nine men. The team departs from Green River, Wyoming, in four rowboats and is made up of men of different ages, backgrounds, personalities and motivations for joining up. In one rowboat there are two former army officers who fought on opposing sides during the Civil War. In another rowboat, one man is a recovering alcoholic and the other is a boozing Englishman who constantly taunts the abstinent. Second-in-command is Major Powell's brother, Walter, whose abrasive personality constantly offends the team. The Major excuses his brother's frequent violent outbursts by explaining that Walter's psyche was damaged during the war in a POW camp. Trapper and frontier scout William Dunn joined the team to be away from civilization. Billy 'Missouri' Hawkins joined to cook for the team but some men suspect him of being on the lam. Brothers Oramel and Seneca Howland complete the team. At first, the men are enthusiastic and their spirits are high but as the voyage unfolds their conflicting personalities are leading to frequent clashes. The team has to deal with treacherous river rapids, bad weather, water and food shortages, unforeseen accidents, rugged river banks, poisonous rattlers and murderous Ute Indians. Also, a presumed gigantic waterfalls awaits at the river's end for any unwise traveler foolish enough to venture down the Colorado river.—nufs68"
Darkness Fell on Gotenhafen,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053092/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1945 with the advance of the red army millions of refugees fled from the east of Germany. The ""Wilhelm Gustloff"" loaded with 10,000 civilians and wounded soldiers was sank by a Soviet submarine in less than 55 minutes. At the beginning of 1945, Germany is a defeated nation. Its armies in the east are in full retreat. Due to the rapid advance of the Soviet Red Army, the German-held port of Gdynia (Gotenhafen) is threatened with encirclement. The German command decides to use the port in order to evacuate wounded soldiers and thousands of fleeing civilians from Courland, East Prussia, and Danzig-West Prussia. Two major transport and hospital ships are selected for the mission dubbed Operation Hannibal. One is the Hansa and the other is the Gustloff. Young Maria Reiser is a newly wed whose husband left for the Eastern Front, shortly after their wedding. However, Maria falls in love with Hans Schott, a naval officer assigned to the hospital-ship 'Wilhelm Gustloff'. They have a baby together since Maria is convinced that her husband will never return from the front. However, her husband returns home wounded. With thousands of civilians and wounded soldiers scrambling to board passage on the evacuation ships, Maria takes pity on her wounded husband and asks her lover, Hans Schott, to arrange passage on the 'Wilhelm Gustloff' for herself, her newborn baby and her wounded husband. Moved by her plea, Hans speaks to his superior officer on the Gustloff and brings Maria and her family aboard the ship. On January 30th, 1945, the Hansa and the Gustloff sail from Gdynia (Gotenhafen) toward Kiel. There are roughly over 9,000 souls on board the Gustloff, out of which 5,000 are children. The Gustloff's captain is frustrated with the fact that the Admiralty only provided him with two escort torpedo boats instead of three, and there are reports of enemy submarines in the Baltic Sea. Part through the crossing, the Hansa and a torpedo boat develop mechanical problems and are forced to turn back. The Gustloff and a torpedo boat continue their voyage alone.—nufs68"

The Prime Time,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054206/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bored young girl looking for excitement gets involved with nude modeling, drugs and a rock band. Bored with her comfortable home life, rash 17-year-old Jean Norton (Jo Ann LeCompte) demands that her parents allow her to go out for yet another night. While her mother refuses, her father relents when he hears that Jean has a date with neighborhood boy Tony Jackson (James Brooks), of whom the parents approve.As Tony drives Jean into town, he tries to interest her in a quiet night together, but once they reach the teenagers' soda shop, Jean borrows Tony's car to rendezvous with policeman ""Mack"" McKeen (Frank Roche), with whom she is having an affair.Earlier, Mack and another officer find beatnik portrait artist The Beard (Ray Gronwold) at his studio where they accuse him of molesting minors while drawing them. Although Mack harshly deals with the beatnik, after his partner leaves, Mack hands The Beard a matchbook listing the time that night Mack will return to use the studio for his rendezvous with Jean.Later, Mack, unable to leave work, calls The Beard at the Golden Goose bar, where the artist recites poetry and draws customers for money, and orders him to return to the studio to tell Jean to go home. Meanwhile at the soda club, Tony's friends, wanting to cheer him up, convince him to go swimming. Smitten with Tony, Gloria (Maria Pavelle) gives him a ride, but when they reach the lake, Tony is so glum about Jean's rejection that he refuses to leave the car. All the kids are skinny-dipping when Gloria finally decides to join them, but when one of the boys scares her with a frog, Gloria runs into Tony's arms. Unable to resist her naked body, Tony kisses her, then joins in the fun.Back at the studio, Jean decides to pose nude for The Beard, hoping to make Mack jealous, but when The Beard tries to adjust her body in the light, Jean is so repulsed that she calls him a ""little shrimp."" Furious, The Beard attacks her and then ties her up. When Jean does not show up at the soda shop by eleven o'clock that evening, Tony decides to wait for her with shop owner Luigi (Herbert Graham), who is cleaning after closing.Hours later, Tony finally asks Gloria to call the Nortons to see if Jean has returned home on her own, but Gloria learns that Jean is not there. After a call to the police reveals that no accidents have been reported, Gloria and Tony search the town for his car and finally locate it, although Jean is nowhere to be found. Tony returns home where his parents and the Nortons bitterly reprimand him, even though he tells them that Jean was not with him for the evening.While the Nortons believe Jean might have run away, when Tony checks her room the next day, he finds no evidence of her packing for a long trip. Instead he finds several matchbooks with times for rendezvous written on their covers, including one that asks Jean to meet at The Beard's. Tony enlists his friends, who all use pictures of Jean to find out where she was last seen. Showing her photo to a bar hostess, Tony learns that Jean was a frequent visitor who had seduced policeman Mack and planned to leave town to become a stripper in the city.Meanwhile, one of Tony's friends, Shorty (Robert Major), discovers that The Beard is a regular at the Golden Goose, where the bartender told him that Jean was a prostitute. Furious, Tony storms over to the Golden Goose and demands to know where The Beard is, but the belligerent bartender throws him out. After Shorty knocks the man out, Tony orders him to arrange for The Beard to meet him at the Golden Goose that evening.Back at the studio, The Beard tells Jean that he has forged farewell notes to her family and friends announcing that she is leaving town. When Jean continues to belittle and mock him, The Beard threatens to kill her.Meanwhile, Mack is sent in to investigate Jean's disappearance. Tony offers him the evidence he has found, but Mack loudly orders him to stay away. Unaware that Jean is being held captive at the studio, Mack orders The Beard to leave town to protect himself from police scrutiny for sleeping with a minor. Meanwhile, Tony, believing that McKeen is probably the ""Mack"" whom the hostess mentioned, rushes to the Golden Goose to interrogate The Beard, who claims that Jean ""blew town."" Soon after, The Beard hurries home, with Tony and Gloria in pursuit, but The Beard loses them.Arriving at his studio, The Beard sedates Jean and packs his bags. As he turns on all his gas burners to asphyxiate the young woman, The Beard drops a pocketful of matches and his last remaining money without noticing. After rushing out to catch the next train, The Beard realizes that he must return to fetch the money. Tony and Gloria spot him and follow him back to his apartment, where The Beard picks up the money, but as he tries to escape out his kitchen window to elude Tony and Gloria, he slips on a match underfoot and ignites the room. The resulting explosion propels him out the window to his death. Tony rescues the unconscious Jean and hands her to Mack, telling him ""she's yours."" As she comes to, the conniving Jean, desperate to escape her parents, threatens to expose Mack for consorting with a minor if he does not marry her.

In the Nineteenth Century, at the seaside resort of Yalta, the upper class Dimitri Gurov from Moscow meets Anna Sergeyovna walking with her little dog. Both have unhappy marriages: Dimitri has a marriage of convenience arranged by the family when he was a college boy and Anna married a lackey for love that has gone, and they have a love affair. When Anna returns to Saratov and Dimitri to Moscow, he has a boring life at home, spending his time working and going to the club after hours alone to drink and play cards with his friends. On Christmas, Dimitri misses Anna and lies to his wife, telling that he has a business trip to Saint Petersburg. However, he heads to Saratov and he meets Anna in the Opera House with her husband. Their love kindles and Anna promises to meet him in Moscow. In a period when divorce would be unthinkable, Anna and Dimitri are doomed to meet each other in hotel rooms.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On holiday in Yalta, Muscovite banker Dimitri Gurov contrives to meet a young woman who walks her dog.

In desperation, he contrives to go to Saratov, surprising her at a concert. Fearing discovery in her home town, she promises to come to Moscow. Will they cast aside reputation to live together, or will theirs be an affair of infrequent encounters in hotel rooms?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> At first glance, any film director could find an endless source of film scripts available in the archives of the World literature. This is true, however, only if this director had no respect for the literary works. Otherwise, using a novel or short story as the basis for a film script requires a director with a remarkable understanding of its author, a total mastery of the film techniques, and of course genius. Heifitz seems to have possessed all three attributes when he directed his film ""The Lady with the Little Dog"", (also known as ""The Lady with the Dog"" and ""The Lady with the Lap Dog""), an adaptation of ""Dama s sobachkoi,"" by Anton Chekhov (1860 - 1904). This short story, which Heifitz rendered flawlessly on the screen, is among Chekhov's most poignant and lyrical.Dmitri Gurov (Aleksei Batalov), a banker from Moscow in his early forties, is on vacation at Yalta, a seaside resort on the Black Sea notorious for its casual love affairs. He enters Verney's pavilion for a drink, sitting next to some familiars of the establishment. One of them tells him of a newly arrived, attractive young lady""There has been a lady promenading, good enough to eat. All by herself, with a little white dog.""A moment later, the lady in question appears, walking along the esplanade with a Pomeranian dog on a leash. She is relatively young and attractive, and Gurov's instincts as a womanizer awaken. The next day, while having a drink at Verney's, Gurov gets a chance to start a conversation with the lady as she comes in and sits down, the little white dog a help in breaking the ice. Gurov and the lady later go for a walk. On the walk, she reveals that she is Anna Sergeyevna (Iya Savvina), she lives in the provincial town of Saratov, and is married to a dullard, a civil servant, a certain von Dideritz (Pantelejmon Krymov). After Gurov walks Anna back to her hotel, we see him in his room, pensive: obviously, this is going to be more than just another conquestDuring the following week, Anna and Gurov spend lot of time together and grow closer. They go for walks and often observe the sunsets over the sea. Anna confesses to him that her life is one of loneliness, somewhat meaningless. One day, she goes to the harbor with a bouquet of flowers, as if to meet someone arriving on the daily steamboat, but Anna was just pretending: there is no one to be met. Gurov, who had followed her unnoticed, meets her and indirectly divulges some of his own feelings for her. They kiss and they go back to her hotel room, which is lit by a single candle. The seduction happens off screen, and in the next scene, Anna is now full of remorse. ""You won't respect me now,"" she says. Gurov gently tries to reassure her that she is wrong. Anna alternates between self-reproach and rationalizing her behavior on account of her boring life in Saratov, having married young to a husband whom she calls a ""lackey.""Later on, she has somewhat appeased her conscience and she tries to appear casual, minimizing the significance of her affair, but she is not too convincing. She receives a letter from her husband, asking her to return and help him take care of a minor ailment. So, the lovers say goodbye at the train station, just like many goodbyes at any other time, any other place, by any other lovers, torn and internally shattered. Gurov kisses her hand tenderly and walks along the train as it leaves the station. He turns and spies one of Anna's gloves on the ground. He picks it up, and in a self-delusional pretense, instead of keeping it as a memento, he casually puts it on the nearby fence. This is the beginning of a vain effort to forget his last fling.In Moscow, Gurov has resumed his life with its routines: the Club, the walks, the friends, his work at the bank, etc. He hopes for Anna's memory to fade. During a dinner party at his house, we meet his wife (Nina Alisova), a rather stern and cold woman, his two children, and some of the couple's friends. Gurov is asked to play the piano, a romantic piece, which obviously means nothing to his audience. By contrast, the music makes Gurov's mind wander back to Yalta, and the candle on the piano, recalling the one in Anna's room after their first encounter, reinforces his nostalgia.Gurov's memory of Anna increasingly haunts him. He is bored by his family, by the irrelevance of his daily routine, and by his friends' lack of understanding and sarcastic view of love. He decides to go to Saratov, telling his wife he is going on a business trip to St. Petersburg. Once in Satarov, he goes to Anna's house and waits outside, in the hope she will somehow emerge. The house is forbiddingly surrounded by a ""long grey fence with nails in it,"" as Anna had told him back in Yalta. The white dog comes out of the house but not Anna, although he waits, freezing, late into the night. Returning to his hotel room, he eyes fall on a billboard with the poster advertising a performance of the operetta The Geisha, for the following night. He guesses that Anna will probably attend, and decides to take the chance and go there, too.As hoped, the next day Anna is at the theater, but with her husband, of course. During the intermission, upon seeing the husband in the foyer smoking a cigarette, Gurov goes to meet Anna, who had remained in her seat. She is shocked at seeing him, and terrified. They rush from the auditorium in search of a more private area in the back of the theater, away from prying eyes. There, overwhelmed, they embrace and kiss passionately. Anna is obviously frightened of being discovered in this situation, and she promises Gurov she will come to Moscow.Once back in Moscow, Gurov periodically checks at the post office for a letter announcing Anna's visit. Eventually, a letter reaches him informing him of her intended visit. Anna arrives in Moscow and sends a note by courier to Gurov, who is not at home. Sad and resigned, she waits in her lonely hotel room, at the mercy of fate. The opportunity for Gurov to come to her hotel arises the next day, as he takes his young daughter to school. Gurov meets Anna in her room. She is awkward and sad because, although they were just reunited, she knows they will soon part. He tries to be casual, but he, too, feels time's pressure. From their conversation, we learn that this meeting in a hotel room in Moscow is not the first one, but that there have been other meetings previously. So, this scene is meant to be typical, even with all its drama and agony. Gurov is again trying to be optimistic, implying that their affair will last ten to twenty years. The next scene shows the lovers, as seen from outside the double windowpane, engaged in a conversation. We don't hear their words, but we know that they are discussing how to bring a happy conclusion to their apparently hopeless situation.The film ends with the poignant scene of Anna looking from her window at Gurov, who walks across the yard below, in the cold, snowy night. She raps desperately at the frozen window, and he turns around and salutes her."

Traveling down a river in a dugout canoe, Samson discovers Benson's murdered body in a mangrove swamp. In Benson's hand is an amulet bearing the image of the Tiger God. When Samson reaches Fernando's compound, he is greeted by him and his young daughter Morena and tells them about Benson's death. After Fernando confirms that the Vicuni Indians still worship their old gods, Samson decides to go to a nearby village to investigate Benson's death. On his way to the village, Samson is attacked by a jaguar and, while two Indians watch, he wrestles the animal and stabs it to death. That night at a village cantina, Samson is approached by an Indian named Tumic, who tells him that because he has killed the ""tiger,"" the spirit of their ancestors, Tumic's tribe must now sacrifice a virgin girl. Samson notices that Tumic is wearing an amulet identical to the one he found in Benson's hand. Tumic then states that Benson was killed by members of Tumic's tribe for attempting to shoot the tiger. The next day, when Fernando and Morena go fishing, Tumic and three other Indians kill Fernando and kidnap Morena. When Samson learns of this, he imagines the terrible fate facing Morena and heads for the area where he believes she is being held.

Mi último tango,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054080/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young woman working as a maid for a big time stage performer is mistaken for the star in Buenos Aires and becomes a great success in the land of the tango. Spain, in the mid 1920s. Maestro Andreu leads a traveling opera company which features a large cast of musicians and singers headed by his present wife Adelina, an aging prima donna with limited singing talent and a nasty disposition. Rounding off the cast is Andreus daughter by a previous marriage Marta, who dreams of becoming a great singing star and Andreus sister Clarisa who plays the contrabass and is very protective of her niece. Both women are naturally at odds with Adelina who treats them like hired help.
The company has just performed in a small venue without much success and is skipping town leaving behind a bunch of unpaid bills and angry creditors. While waiting at the train station, Marta meets a mysterious handsome man named Dario Ledesma and is quite impressed by him. However, theres no time for romance since they must board the train that will carry them to the next town and next performance. That gig turns out to be their greatest disaster ever. Marta, playing the part of a soldier, screws up the whole opera and the hillbilly audience reacts by throwing all kinds of produce to the stage. Bowing to Adelinas angry demands, Maestro Andreu fires Marta and Clarisa from the company. Niece and aunt travel to Madrid hoping for a big break but Marta ends up as the maid of temperamental singing star Luisa Marival. During a show, Marival looses her voice temporarily and is rescued by Marta who carries the song from back stage. To reward her, Marival decides to take Marta to Buenos Aires where she has a contract to fulfill and also hires Clarisa as road manager.
The day of the departure, Marta and Clarisa are aboard the ship unpacking the huge Marival baggage when they suddenly receive an urgent note from her. The singer has been convinced by her boyfriend-manager to stay in Spain and, in order to avoid a law suit, she asks Marta and Clarisa to go on without her and to keep her absence a secret until she sends further instructions. The ship sails on and Clarisa must fender the excitement among fellow passengers and crew to see Luisa Marival in person. A group manages to break into the Marival plush cabin and mistakenly take Marta for the artist. She tries to clarify the error but nobodys listening and soon she finds herself signing autographs with the name Luisa Marival...
After this, Marta and Clarisa see no reason to stay locked in their cabin. They accept the Captains invitation to dine at his table and make a suitable showing by wearing outfits from Marivals wardrobe, jewelry and accessories. Marta is surprised to find there Dario, the handsome stranger she met at the train station when she was with her fathers opera troupe, however he doesnt seem to recognize her. Relieved, Marta accepts dancing with him and soon allows him to escort her to all the onboard social activities. While a romance brews between them, Clarisa is having a hard time fending off the ships bill collectors and makes all kinds of excuses to hide the fact they are flatly broke.
Meanwhile some professional swindlers are preying on Clarisa thinking that she manages the Marival finances and invite her to a friendly game of poker. The plan is to let her win at the beginning and rip her of later. However Clarisa is not the fool they expect and once she has won a respectable amount of money the game is interrupted by Marta who fakes anger at her secretary for risking her fortune on gambling... Clarisa apologizes profusely and walks away with all the money. Later, aunt and niece shake hands at the success of their gambling act and Clarisa runs to the ships cashier to pay their mounting expenses. Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, there are no news for Marta and Clarisa from the absent Luisa Marival and both women feel totally lost without any idea of what their next move should be. Marta is jumped by the local press who also mistakes her for the singing star taking her denials as a celebrity's effort to defend her privacy. Marta searches for Dario to enlist his help but the man seems to have vanished at the port. The suspense is broken by a messenger carrying flowers and informing Marta that there is a car waiting for her provided by the theater management holding Luisa Marivals contract. Without any other choice, Marta and Clarisa go along and are driven directly to the offices of a beautiful theater. While waiting they engage in conversation with a young Argentine named Carlos Gardel who introduces himself as an aspiring singer. He promises to attend the Luisa Marival debut in Buenos Aires and Marta promises she will be present in his singing debut. After this short exchange, Marta is taken to meet the theater management who, surprisingly, happens to be Dario Ledesma. Marta is extremely peeved thinking that the man has been playing games with her all along and wishes him financial ruin now that Luisa Marival is not there and will not be able to perform. However Dario has other plans in mind and theres not much Marta can do, alone and broke in a foreign country. On opening night, Marta sings as Luisa Marival and has an enormous success with the SRO audience. Moved by the Argentineans response and encouraged by Carlos Gardel she dares to sing a tango in the land of the tango. The public goes wild and Marta becomes the darling of Buenos Aires. However she is not happy at all with her achievements since hearing that Dario was following her performance sitting in the audience with his fiancée Patricia. The following day Marta refuses to talk to Dario and even destroys a floral arrangement sent by him. However she does answer a strange telephone call from Patricia who wishes to meet her personally in her home. Marta accepts out of curiosity and finds Patricia to be very pretty and very charming. Patricia admits to Marta that she has been engaged to Dario for sometime but has decided to break it off. She explains that she has noticed Darios interest for Marta and does not want to get in the way of his happiness. Marta is quite confused by the womans generosity but Patricia only explains that compassion is not a good substitute for love. Marta finally understands when she discovers that Patricia is confined to a wheel chair.
Marta and Dario, now a happy couple, attend the debut of Carlos Gardel at a typical tango inn. By now, Marta knows all about Patricias unfortunate horse riding accident which left her paralyzed for life. Dario had been willing to marry her even after the tragedy but she knew instinctively she could not make Dario happy in her condition. She made the ultimate sacrifice of love by releasing him of his commitment and allowing him to find happiness. Marta feels like she is living a fairy tale with her singing success and her upcoming wedding to Dario. The magic is broken off by the sudden appearance of Luisa Marival in Martas dressing room. The singer is quite angry and intends to go on stage that night and dennouce the fraud committed by Marta by impersonating her. After much explaining and begging without any results, Marta locks Luisa in a closet and goes on stage to sing her last tangos in Buenos Aires. At the end she tells the adoring audience that whatever happens, be assured that Ive given you my heart. Meanwhile Luisa is trying to push her way out of the closet and a burning candle ignites a fire. Soon theres smoke everywhere and the building is in flames. Marta hears that the fire started in her dressing room and risks her life to rescue Luisa. However, Marta ends up with a head injury that renders her blind.
In spite of the doctors assurance that with proper treatment she would regain her sight, Marta is not so quite sure herself. Dario has given her the wedding band and has set a date for the marriage but Marta is obsessed remembering Patricias words: compassion is not a good substitute for love. After much agonizing over it, Marta decides to flee back to Spain without finishing her treatment and hide from Dario. She and Clarisa find themselves as fourth class passengers on a ship back to their country. Once there they live modestly on the income Clarisa earns giving music and voice lessons. Dario, who has hired private investigators to search for them, finally finds them but Marta pretends she has regained her sight and tells him that she doesnt love him anymore and just wants to be left alone. Realizing what shes up to, Dario devices his own ploy to help her and get her back. He contacts a friend who is an eye specialist and talks him into pretending being interested in music lessons in order to gain access to Clarisa and Marta. After doing his little act, the doctor earns the womens confidence and offers his services to Marta in exchange for the Clarisas contrabass lessons. After a few weeks of treatment, Marta is cured and longs for Darios return but the next person who knocks on her door is none other than her father who has come to beg forgiveness. He is now old, sick and alone but reuniting with his family gives him great hope. Is not long before Maestro Andreu is back in show business with a new company, this time headed by Marta Andreu, performing for the first time under her real name, and aunt Clarisa serving as orchestra conductor. Finally, Dario catches up with them and has an emotional reunion with Marta. They are happy at last."

Captain Lechi,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172643/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Kosmet in the fall of 1944. The Partisans have successfully liberated the town of Prizren from occupying Germans,and Ramiz Lesi, a brave and cunning KNOJ captain, has to liquidate the remainder of the local Quislings, called Balists. They are led by a ruthless, German-trained soldier Kosta and by Ahmet, the brother of the famous Captain.As Ramiz is trying to get Ahmet out of the gang and hunt down the rest of the Balists, 2 new girls arrive in town. One of them is Lola, a bar singer with a questionable agenda, and the other is Vida, a withdrawn music teacher from Belgrade.—Anonymous A Kosmet town called Prizren in the fall of 1944. The Partisans are desperately trying to free the town, but their attempts have been unsuccessful so far. The Partisan commander, Major Demir(Abdurrahman Sala), calls in one of his best men, Captain Ramiz Lesi(Aleksandar Gavric). While on their way, Ramiz and his comrades capture a German convoy carrying food into town and decide to use it for their purposes.As part of the plan, Partisans fake a withdrawal. After seeing them leave, the local Wehrmacht commander, Colonel Becker(Dusan Perkovic) orders a temporary withdrawal of German forces. However, he orders the leaders of a local Balist group, Kosta(Dimitar Kiostarov) and Ahmet(Rainer Penkert) to hide in the hills with their men and carry out a guerilla war against their enemies.Meanwhile, Ramiz and his comrades enter Prizren, disguised as German soldiers and driving the convoy they captured. After driving through town without attracting any attention, they drive their way into the German High Command and capture everyone inside, including Becker. This beheads the Germans and leaves them vulnerable to a successful counter-attack. After analyzing captured German documents, Demir informs Ramiz that Kosta and his men have already escaped, his brother Ahmet among them.The story continues in the spring of 1945. The war keeps raging in Europe and Yugoslavia, but the inhabitants of Prizren have already gotten used to a peaceful life. Ramiz is now a KNOJ officer in the town of Pec and rarely ever visits his home town. When he finally comes for business reasons, he finds himself between the local bar owner and Vida(Marika Tocinovska), a pretty music teacher sent from Belgrade. Both want a piano which Ramiz keeps in his old house- the bar owner needs it for his new orchestra, and Vida needs it for her classes. Ramiz decides to deal with Vida and invites her to the house to try out the piano, but they have a fall out when he tries to kiss her.Next evening, Ramiz and his surrogate-father, old man Sok(Petar Prlicko) visit the bar. Ramiz s former Corporal appeals him by having the orchestra and its singer Lola(Elma Karlowa)sing a song in his honor. Angry that Lola would rather sing to Ramiz than flirt with him, a local smuggler(Pavle Vujisic)interrupts the song and calls Ramiz names, reminding the people of all the crimes commited by Ahmet and his gang. ok stands up to him and gets slapped in the face, which provokes Ramiz into a fight with the smuggler and his 2 pals. He wins, throws the smuggler out and spends a passionate night with Lola in her room.Next morning, Ramiz says goodbye to Lola and returns to his work in Pec. He argues with Demir, angry because he removed him from the field. Demir refuses to admit he did it because Ahmet is his brother,but he warns him he won t be peaceful as long as Ahmet is a bandit.3 days later, Ramiz and Sok meet a friend who reveals that a Balist courier came into town to take over some gold and morphini from an informant. Before he can reveal who the informant is, he is shot and killed by the courier. Ramiz chases the killer to a morgue and tries to talk him into surrendering, but he refuses and is killed by a soldier who came by. While searching the dead man, Ramiz finds a bag of gold and a box of morphini. Remembering that he saw an identical box in Lola s room, Ramiz goes to the bar, breaks into her room and starts searching it. Lola finds him in her room and hands the box over to him. When he opens it, he finds only strings and buttons and realizes he was wrong after all.Meanwhile, a Balist informant(Dusan Antonijevic) goes into the hills and informs Kosta that KNOJ killed his courier and impounded the gold and morphini. Worried because he promised payments to his men, Kosta decides to talk to the local landowners, who are financially backing him because they are afraid the Communists will take their land away from them.Next evening, the whole gang gets off the mountain and sneaks into a village. They attack the local political HQ and assassinate all members of the head Communist committee. One member of the gang is wounded and captured, while the others escape. Ramiz goes to the village and interrogates the captured Balist. He finds out that Ahmet is not really a Balist(he never killed anybody), but just a figurehead. Kosta uses him to draw more men into his gang, since his late father was very respected in Prizren. He also reveals that the landowners washed their hands off Kosta, aware of the nearing German capitulation, and that the gang is currently hiding in a mountain near the village of Rugovo.After leaving an explanatory note for Major Demir, Ramiz rides into the Rugovo hills. He hopes to find the gang and talk them into surrendering through Ahmet. When he stops by a water well, he sees a shirt floating in it. He hides behind a rock as a Balist(Zlatibor Stoimirov)comes to collect his shirt, then grabs his gun and forces him at gunpoint to lead him to the rest of the gang.When he finds the rest of the gang, Ramiz reveals himself to Ahmet, saying he wants to talk to him alone. Meanwhile, Lola is asking around about his whereabouts and finds out that Demir has sent a lot of men into the hills to look for him. When his informant tells him about it, Kosta becomes worried that KNOJ might find them while looking for Ramiz and decides to send him away immediately. He secretly orders Skender(Darko Damevski), one of his top men, to kill Ramiz as he tries to return to Prizren.Meanwhile, Ahmet finally tells Ramiz why he became a Balist. When Ramiz joined the Partisans in the summer of 1943, the Quisling police started making a lot of trouble to their respectable father. Ahmet joined a Balist group in order to turn suspicion away from his brother and, later on, was too scared to leave them. Kosta interrupts their conversation and angrily sends Ramiz away.However, he does not go alone:Ahmet goes side by side with him. When Kosta stops them, Ahmet reveals that he has decided to accept the proposition of surrender. A gunfight erupts between Kosta and his loyalists on one side and Ramiz, Ahmet and their loyalists on the other. A Balist is shot in the eyes and blinded during the fight. As he frantically runs between 2 fires, Ramiz and his comrades use the temporary cese-fire to escape into Prizren.When Ramiz gives him his report, Demir yells at him for taking such action without thinking first. He reveals that Kosta and his gang are still active and that they have recently killed 3 soldiers, his former Corporal among them. Ramiz feels guilty because he did not stop the gang when he had the chance. Later, he visits Vida who lovingly hugs him, revealing her love for him. Sok finds him there and tells him that, according to some rumors, Ahmet will be sentenced and hanged after all. The rumor helps Ramiz think up a plan to hunt down the rest of the gang.Demir immediately puts the plan into action. Ahmet and the other defectors are secretly imprisoned, and the inhabitants of Prizren are falsely informed that they were sentenced and hanged. Using the ""death""of his brother as an excuse, Ramiz becomes a deserter. Kosta learns about it from his informant and sends 2 men to search the hills. They find Ramiz and take him to their new hideout, where he tells them he wants to join them so that he could avenge his brother. Kosta takes him, although he does not fully trust him.However, he is unaware that Sok was following Ramiz and watching the meeting with his binoculars. After making sure that Ramiz is now a Balist, Sok informs Demir about it in his HQ. He immediately orders his adjutant, Lt.Imer(Milivoje Popovic-Mavid)to get as many volunteers as he can in Rugovo and stage a manhunt in the hills. It is meant to scare Kosta into runnig for the border, which will help them to execute the second part of their plan. He also tells Sok to return to the place where he left Ramiz and contact the gang.After Imer had found some volunteers, the manhunt begins. Meanwhile, Sok finds the Balist camp and informs them about it. He also shows Kosta a newspaper ad about the capitulation of Nazi Germany.Ramiz starts trying to talk Kosta into fleeing across the border.Meanwhile, Ahmet angrily confronts Demir, wanting to know what is actually going on. Demir tells him off- screen, but Ahmet now wants him to turn him loose so that he can find Ramiz and help him. Demir refuses, so he cuts himself with a piece of broken glass. This gets him to hospital, where he owerpowers a guard, takes his uniform and escapes from the jail. With the help of teacher Vida, he manages to get to the hills disguised as an old woman.After a few days of thinking, Kosta finally agrees with Ramiz. He sends Sok to contact the Balist committee stationed in Skoplje and for their help in getting across the border. However, Sok immediately informs Demir about the adress in which a committee man, Kemal, will be waiting for him. Demir immediately leaves for Skoplje to handle the arrests of the committee members(which happen off-screen). His other adjutant, Lt.Nikola Petrovic(Pance Kamdzik), hides Sok in his apartment for 2 days so it would appear he really was in Skoplje. When he returns to Kosta, Sok, accordingly to the Major s instructions, tells him that a committee man will be waiting for 5 days in Djavolje Selo, a village near the border. The gang immediately starts their trip.Lola, who is now revealed to be Kosta s lover and informant, receives a message from the other informant. He tells her that the gang is leaving for the border and that she can tag along.He also tells that he is suspicious about Captain Lesi, since he recently saw his supposedly-dead brother in the house of teacher Vida.Some time later, the gang stops by an abandoned shed. Kosta meets Lola in the shed, but he is very cold towards her and only interested in what information she got him. As Ahmet catches up to the gang and continues following them, the gang moves on for a short time, then stops again. Lola warns Ramiz that she knows Ahmet is alive and then goes to Kosta, planning to tell him about it. However, before she could tell anything, Kosta reveals the reasons of his animosity- he cannot forget about the fact that Lola got the most of her information through pillow talk with KNOJ officers. She does not deny it, but she also tells him she did it only for his sake. In her anger, Lola keeps the truth about Ramiz a secret, but later tells him she wants full amnesty in return. Balists continue their trip to Djavolje Selo, completely unaware that Major Demir has already set up an ambush for them.The next evening, they finally arrive at Djavolje Selo. As they are checking their surroundings for any enemies, Skender and another Balist run into their informant. He tells Skender that Ahmet is alive, that Sok(who left the gang in the meantime)was never at Skoplje and that Lola knew all about it, but kept silent. When Skender and the informant tell him about it, Kosta confronts Lola and violently strangles her when she confirms the accusations. As Kosta is getting ready to kill Ramiz, he takes out a flashlight Sok gave him and turns it on, giving the attack signal to soldiers waiting in the ambush. They turn on their spotlights,blinding the Balists, and Petrovi contacts them through a loudspeaker, offering them a chance to put down their guns. Most of them surrender, but Skender shuts down 2 spotlights by firing into them. He and Kosta then leave into separate directions.However,Skender quickly runs into another KNOJ ambush nearby and is killed.Meanwhile, Kosta sees Ramiz running after him, so he jumps him in a small pass between 2 rocks and wounds him with his knife. He then gets ready to shoot him, but realizes someone had emptied his automatic gun. He throws it away and tries to leave, but is stopped and killed by Ahmet when he goes for his gun. Sok reveals himself behind a rock, telling Ramiz that he emptied the gun sometime before leaving.The next morning, the captured part of the gang is rounded up and taken away.Demir finds Ramiz among the soldiers and congratulates him for a successful mission.He also reunites him with Vida and they happily leave as the film ends."

The Hound That Thought He Was a Raccoon,1960,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0940822/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hound puppy lost in the woods is nurtured by a female raccoon and forms an enduring bond with one of her cubs. Mala, a female raccoon, lives with her cubs inside an old tree in the South. During a flood caused by an intense storm, the tree collapses and Mala is able to save only one of her cubs, Weecha. Nearby, Jeff Emory, a backwoods ""Mr. Fix It,"" owns a pack of coonhounds, and recently Lulubelle, his prime female, has had a litter of pups. ""Nubbin"" is the most active pup and frequently explores the farmyard. One day his curiosity leads him inside a butter churn that Jeff is about to return to a neighbor, and Jeff loads the churn onto his old truck and drives off with Nubbin still inside. During the trip, the churn falls off the truck, rolls down the road, over an embankment and breaks up against a tree. Nubbin emerges from the wreckage dizzy and lost, but eventually finds the hollow tree where Mala is nursing Weecha. Although hounds and raccoons are natural enemies, Mala nurses Nubbin and mothers him. Two weeks pass and as Nubbin explores the area, he encounters Old Grouch, Weecha's father, who attacks him. Mala intervenes and fights her mate, who later leaves the area. By the time summer rolls arrives, Nubbin and Weecha are firm friends and have several adventures together. One day while chasing a rabbit, Nubbin is threatened by a bobcat, but Mala lures the bobcat away from him and gives her life to save the dog. Now alone, Weecha and Nubbin search for food and when they come upon Jeff fishing, steal his fish. Jeff realizes that Nubbin is Lulubelle's missing pup and captures both of them, putting Weecha in an unused rabbit hutch. Jeff is surprised when Nubbin refuses to abandon his friend, and later, Weecha manipulates the latch on his cage and escapes for a nighttime romp with Nubbin, during which he wrecks Jeff's workshop. When an iron rod falls against a grinding wheel Weecha has accidentally started, sparks fly and start a fire, but Weecha races back to his cage. After Jeff is awakened by his hounds' barking and extinguishes the fire, he discovers Weecha and Nubbin sleeping innocently. Three weeks later, Jeff begins to train Nubbin and his other young hounds to locate raccoons by following their scent. At first Jeff uses a raccoon skin as bait, but when he switches to Weecha, Nubbin refuses to work and fights off all the other dogs. Several months later, Jeff is invited on a coon hunt in a neighboring valley and leaves with his favorite hound, Rounder. Nubbin and Weecha are now full grown although Weecha is still a captive in the rabbit hutch. However, the hound helps his friend to escape and Weecha, having learned how to manipulate the latches on the hutches, releases all of Jeff's rabbits. Unfortunately, he steps on the trigger of a shotgun and the shot alerts the hounds, who break out of their enclosure to chase the rabbits. Weecha hides inside a barrel, which the dogs roll over just as Jeff returns with Rounder. Weecha manages to escape but is pursued by Rounder. While fighting in a pond, Weecha grabs Rounder by the neck and almost drowns him, then escapes. By autumn, Weecha has completely reverted to the wild and survives by stealing duck eggs, as well as nuts and berries from pine squirrel nests. In the spring, as Jeff and his friends begin a new hunting season with plans for a kill, Weecha finds and courts a mate, Waheena. When Weecha hears the hounds approaching, he instinctively uses a decoy trick learned from his father to draw the pack away from his mate. Nubbin is the leader of the pack, and when he corners Weecha, he recognizes his old friend and barks happily. Unfortunately, Nubbin's barking attracts the other dogs and he finds himself fighting his own kind in order to protect his friend. After Jeff arrives and sizes up the situation, he asks the other hunters to call off their dogs. As Weecha runs off, followed by Nubbin, Jeff explains their history. When Nubbin finds Weecha with his mate, Weecha chases him away, and Nubbin, realizing that their friendship can no longer continue, vows never to hunt Weecha again and returns to Jeff, his friend and master."
