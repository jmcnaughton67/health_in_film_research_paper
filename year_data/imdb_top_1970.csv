Love Story,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066011/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A boy and a girl from different backgrounds fall in love regardless of their upbringing - and then tragedy strikes. The love story of young adults Oliver Barrett IV and Jenny Cavilleri is told. Oliver comes from an extremely well off and old money New England family, the Barrett name which holds much gravitas and which is plastered especially all over Harvard where Oliver is in pre-law. Like those before him, he plans on attending Harvard Law School, which is not an issue in either the school not accepting him or he not wanting to attend. He has an extremely stiff relationship with his parents, especially his father, Oliver Barrett III, who loves his son in the old school way. Jenny, a music student at Radcliffe, comes from a working class Rhode Island background, she working her way through the program before she plans on going to Paris to further her studies. Unlike Oliver's relationship with his father, Jenny has a very casual one with her baker father, who she calls by his given name Phil. When Oliver and Jenny meet, there are immediate fireworks - she always with a quick quip to put him in his place - both of a good and bad kind, but they both quickly come to the realization that they are in love with each other. They have many obstacles to overcome in having a committed relationship, outwardly his father's disapproval of someone like her not being Barrett material being arguably the the biggest. However, other things that happen in the natural course of life and death may trump all.—Huggo Harvard law student Oliver Barrett IV, and music student Jennifer Cavilleri, share a chemistry they cannot deny--and a love they cannot ignore. Despite their opposite backgrounds, the young couple put their hearts on the line for each other. When they marry, Oliver's wealthy father threatens to disown him. Jenny tries to reconcile the Barrett men but to no avail. Oliver and Jenny continue to build their life together. Relying only on each other, they believe love can fix anything. But fate has other plans. Soon, what began as a brutally honest friendship, became the love story of their lives.—Nick Riganas The film tells of Oliver Barrett IV, who comes from a family of wealthy and well-respected Harvard University graduates. At Radcliffe library, the Harvard student meets and falls in love with Jennifer Cavelleri, a working-class, quick-witted Radcliffe College student. Upon graduation from college, the two decide to marry against the wishes of Oliver's father, who thereupon severs ties with his son.Without his father's financial support, the couple struggles to pay Oliver's way through Harvard Law School with Jenny working as a private school teacher. They rent the top floor of a house near the Law School at 119 Oxford Street, in the Agassiz neighborhood of Cambridge, adjacent to a local laundromat (still in existence today - MyOxfordLaundry.com). Graduating third in his class at Harvard Law, Oliver takes a position at a respectable New York law firm.With Oliver's new income, the pair of 24-year-olds decide to have a child. After failing, they consult a medical specialist, who after repeated tests, informs Oliver that Jenny is ill and will soon die. Oliver then tries again. While this is not stated explicitly, she appears to have leukemia.As instructed by his doctor, Oliver attempts to live a ""normal life"" without telling Jenny of her condition. Jenny nevertheless discovers her ailment after confronting her doctor about her recent illness. With their days together numbered, Jenny begins costly cancer therapy, and Oliver soon becomes unable to afford the multiplying hospital expenses. Desperate, he seeks financial relief from his father. When the senior Barrett asks if he needs the money because he got some girl ""in trouble"", Oliver says yes instead of telling his father the truth about Jenny's condition.From her hospital bed, Jenny speaks with her father about funeral arrangements, then asks for Oliver. She tells him to avoid blaming himself, and asks him to embrace her tightly before she dies. They lie together on the hospital bed.The novel also includes the double meaning of a love story between Oliver and his father, highlighted by the scene between Oliver and his father at the end of the book. When Mr. Barrett realizes that Jenny is ill and that his son borrowed the money for her, he immediately sets out for New York. By the time he reaches the hospital, Jenny has died. Mr. Barrett apologizes to his son, who replies with something Jenny once told him: ""Love means never having to say you're sorry."""
Airport,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065377/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bomber on board an airplane, an airport almost closed by snow, and various personal problems of the people involved. This precursor to later ""epic"" 1970s disaster films presents 12 hours in the lives of the personnel and passengers at the ""Lincoln Airport."" Endless problems, professional and personal, are thrown at the various personnel responsible for the safe and proper administration of air traffic, airline management, and aviation at a major US airport. Take one severe snowstorm, add multiple schedules gone awry; one elderly Trans Global Airlines stowaway; shortages; an aging, meretricious pilot; unreasonable, peevish spouses; manpower issues, fuel problems, frozen runways; and equipment malfunctions, and you get just a sample of the obstacles faced by weary, disgruntled personnel and passengers at the Lincoln Airport. Toss in one long-suffering pilot's wife, several stubborn men, office politics and romance, and one passenger with a bomb, and you have the film ""Airport"" from 1970.—LA-Lawyer Mel Bakersfeld, the general manager of a Chicago-area airport, must contend with a massive snowstorm and other issues, both work-related and personal, while the troubled D.O. Guerrero threatens to blow up an airliner. As pilot Vernon Demerest attempts to calm Guerrero down and dissuade him from setting off explosives on the plane, tensions increase in the air and on the ground, and danger is imminent.—Jwelch5742 The worst snowstorm in six years, it covering all of the northeast US and eastern Canada, is exacerbating all the problems in Mel Bakersfeld's life, he the General Manager of Lincoln International Airport in Chicago. The biggest problem caused by the storm is a Boeing 707 jet being stuck in the field effectively closing down runway two-niner, the longest of the two at the facility. Mel has had to call in expert engineer Joe Patroni on his day off to deal with that issue. But the snow is only highlighting the many other operational problems at the aging airport, his biggest critic being pilot Vernon Demerest, who just happens to be his philandering brother-in-law. Mel's sister, Sarah Demerest, knows that Vern will one day settle down to a stable home life with her, she unaware that he and current steady girlfriend, flight attendant Gwen Meighen, the two among the on-board crew of Trans Global Airlines (TGA) ""Golden Argosy"" Flight 2 to Rome this evening, necessarily evaluating their relationship based on some unexpected developments. The snow also focuses more of Mel's attention on work this evening, he and his wife, Cindy Bakersfeld, who are already continually arguing about he placing home second to work. Mel can admit to himself that his excuses not to go home on the best of days is due in part to his relationship with TGA customer service agent, widowed Tanya Livingston, it still at the platonic stage despite their professed attraction to each other. The issues at the airport itself take a back seat upon news from that Rome destined flight. While they knew of chronic Los Angeles residing stowaway, aged Ada Quonsett, on the flight, she always trying to find the most expedient and free way to visit her daughter in New York, which this time includes this flight to Rome, the flight and ground crews have credible suspicions that passenger D.O. Guerrero is packing a bomb in the attaché case he is keeping close to his person. Not wanting to cause a panic, they all have to find a way to make an emergency landing, which, due to the snow, may make Lincoln and runway two-niner the most viable option, that is if they get that far without Guerrero setting off the bomb and if Patroni can clear the runway of the stuck jet.—Huggo Mel Bakersfeld is the hard-charging manager of Lincoln International Airport, trying to keep his airport open despite a raging Midwestern snowstorm and an angry wife. Meanwhile, his antagonistic brother-in-law Vernon Demerest might have his plans for a placid layover in Italy disturbed by unexpected news from Gwen Meighen and by the plans of D.O. Guerrero, the loose cannon on board.—Steve Fenwick <scf@w0x0f.com> The story takes place during one long night during a sudden blizzard at Lincoln International, a fictional Chicago airport based very loosely on O'Hare International Airport.The action mainly centers on Mel Bakersfeld (Burt Lancaster), the airport general manager. His devotion to his job is tearing apart his family and his marriage to his constantly angry and domineering wife Cindy (Dana Wynter), who resents his use of his job at the airport as a device to avoid going to various after-hours events she wants him to participate in, as she attempts to climb into the social circles of Chicago's elite. His problems in his marriage are further exacerbated by his romantically-charged friendship with a lovely divorcee, Trans America Airlines (TAA) passenger relations manager Tanya Livingston (Jean Seberg).The movie centers on Bakersfeld's struggles to keep the airport open during the snowstorm. His chief problem is the unexpected closure of primary runway 29, caused when a landing airliner turns off past the wrong side of a taxiway marker light, missing the taxiway, and burying the plane's landing gears in the snow, blocking the runway. Bakersfield is forced to call upon Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), the tough and practical head of maintenance operations for Trans World Airlines, at Lincoln. Patroni is told to move the disabled aircraft blocking the runway 29. Patroni spends the rest of the movie with his men to dig the plane out of the snow and fights with the pilots to do so under the aircraft's own power without damaging it.Meanwhile, Bakersfield deals with his brother-in-law Vern Demerest (Dean Martin), a pompous and self-confident senior pilot for Trans Global Airlines (TGA) who opposes Bakersfield on a number of issues involving business and personal issues. Both Mel Bakersfield and his sister Sarah (Barbara Haleare unaware that Vern is having an extramarital affair with Gwen Meighen (Jacqueline Bisset), a chief stewardess on his routine flights who is planning her latest trip to Rome, Italy and is frustrated about her secret affair with Vern, who keeps telling her that he will leave his wife.Back at Lincoln Airport, the closing of runway 29 due to the stuck plane requires the use of the shorter runway 22, which has the unfortunate consequence of causing planes to take off over a noise-sensitive suburb, whose residents picket the airport in protest. Mel Bakersfield insists that the airport stay open despite pressure from the owner and the mayor to close it for the night.A little later, the airport authorities arrest an elderly lady named Mrs. Ada Quonsett (Helen Hayes) who is attempting to board a plane without a ticket. Ada is brought to the TGA lounge office where he and Tanya discover her to be a frequent stowaway who has a long record of stowing away aboard cross-country flights and passing herself off as the ""poor little-old lady"" to get away with it. Mrs. Quonsett is put in the custody of a TGA agent to be put on a flight back to her home in California, but she gives him the slip.Back at the airport, Patroni and his men have dug out the snow from the stuck airplane's landing gear and are attempting to move it. Despite Patroni's orders to use full power, the pilot refuses to do so, for fear it would damage it, and the plane only moves a few feet before getting stuck in the snow again, after which Patroni and the pilot get into a very heated argument. Patroni then tells Bakersfield they have to dig deeper and put lumber under the wheels for added support, and after another heated argument between Bakersfield and the pilot, Bakersfield agrees to let Patroni taxi the airplane out next time, as Patroni is licensed to taxi.Meanwhile, D.O. Guerrero (Van Heflin) is an increasingly psychologically-disturbed, bankrupt building contractor and demolitions expert, who is determined to find a way to solve his financial problems, regardless of what it will cost others. He builds a bomb that fits inside his briefcase with the intention of using it to commit suicide by blowing up a Rome-bound Boeing 707 Intercontinental jet over the Atlantic Ocean so his wife Inez (Maureen Stapleton), who manages a seedy diner, can collect on the $225,000 insurance policy (which he plans to buy at the airport prior to his departure) since a plane crashing in the ocean leaves no trace of evidence for the insurance company to investigate his death. He leaves their apartment, stops at the diner to say goodbye to his wife, and then leaves on the ruse that he intends to take a bus to Milwaukee to start a new job, but the bus is actually bound for the airport. When Inez arrives home, she finds a special delivery letter from the travel agency that issued his plane ticket; they accidentally overcharged Guerrero for the ticket, so there was a partial refund check enclosed with the letter. Confused, she heads to the airport.Gwen and Vern arrive at Lincoln to board their Flight 2 to Rome and she tells him that she just learned that she's pregnant. As the plane begins to board, Ada stows away on plane and sits next to Guerrero who is behaving nervously, holding his briefcase (with the bomb in it) on his lap, intending to detonate it once the plane is over the ocean.After the plane takes off, Guerroero's wife arrives too late at the airport and goes into a state of shock. When she is brought to the security office after she is found wondering around, she manages to tell them about her husband and what he intends to do. Bakersfield learns about this and has Flight 2 contacted to inform Vernon as well as Captain Harris (Barry Nelson) about the bomb on board. Also learning that Ada is on board the flight and sitting next to Guerrero, Bakersfield contacts Vernon on board the flight to turn the plane around back for Chicago.As the plane is being turned around, Gwen approaches Ada, loudly exposing her as a stowaway while ignoring Guerrero, in a ruse to bring her to the cockpit, where Ada is let in on what is going on. Ada agrees to help create a diversion. When she is brought back to her seat by Gwen, Vern appears and attempts to lunge at Guerrero who figures out what is going on and stands up out of his seat. Gwen manages to grab the briefcase, but another grumpy passenger, thinking they are wrongly grabbing ""personal property"", grabs it from Gwen and gives it back to Guerrero. Vern tries to persuade Guerrero not to trigger the bomb since everyone on the ground has figured out his plot and canceled his insurance. For a moment Guerrero looked like he was going to surrender, but another passenger comes out of the lavatory, and that same grumpy passenger yells, ""Grab him, he's got a bomb!!"", startling Guerrero, who runs into the lavatory and detonates the bomb. The detonation blows a large hole in the plane, killing Guerrero and seriously injuring Gwen. The plane is structurally damaged in the explosion and subsequent rapid decompression, forcing the pilot to put the plane into a dive, in order to get below 10,000 feet as quickly as possible, in order to get to breathable air before the passenger oxygen runs out.As Flight 2 returns to Lincoln, Vern realizes the longer runway 29 is still closed and runway 22 is too short to handle the landing of the damaged plane. After a heated argument with Air Traffic Control, which Bakersfield also hears, he realizes the seriousness of the situation that Flight 2 desperately needs to land at runway 29, which still has the stuck-in-the-snow plane on the runway. Patroni and his men are still trying to dig the plane out of the snow and after Bakersfield tells him about the emergency, he goes into the cockpit and attempts to rev up the engines to free the plane, which after few tense moments, Patroni finally manages to do so without damaging the runway or the plane.After a harrowing flight back, Vern along with the other Captain, manages to land the plane on newly reopened runway 29, using the entire length of the runway, and save the rest of the passengers and crew. After everyone had disembarked, he decides to accompany the badly injured Gwen to the hospital where his wife sees him and becomes aware of his affair. He has decided to leave his wife to be with Gwen.After Mrs. Ada Quonsett is cleared of all criminal charges of stowing away, she is given a first class ticket to return to her hometown.His marriage over, Mel Bakersfield asks Tanya if she would like to ""have breakfast"" at her apartment with him, and she happily agrees."
M*A*S*H,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066026/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The staff of a Korean War field hospital use humor and high jinks to keep their sanity in the face of the horror of war. The personnel at the 4077 MASH unit deal with the horrors of the Korean War and the stresses faced in surgery by whatever means. The tone at the MASH is established by recent arrivals, surgeons Captains 'Hawkeye' Pierce, 'Duke' Forrest, and 'Trapper' John McIntyre - the latter who Hawkeye knows he's met somewhere, but Trapper who won't divulge where - whose antics can be best described as non-regulation, and in the negative words of one of their fellow MASH-ers, unmilitary. The unit's commanding officer, Colonel Henry Blake, doesn't care about this behavior as long as it doesn't affect him, and as long as they do their job and do it well, which they do. Their behavior does extremely bother fellow surgeon, Major Frank Burns, and recently arrived head nurse, Major Margaret Houlihan, who obtains the nickname 'Hot Lips' based on information they glean about her through underhanded means. Beyond their battles with Frank and Hot Lips, Hawkeye, Duke and/or Trapper help unit dentist Painless with a personal crisis, try to figure out if Hot Lips is a true blond, travel to Japan for a work and what they hope is a recreational trip, and hope to win big on a football bet against another unit in which they on the surface are the underdogs.—Huggo Based on the novels of Richard Hooker, thisRobert Altmanfilm follows the zany surgeons and other staff of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Korea. Although the top-ranked series was initially based on this film, it was homogeneited; most of the dozens of characters, amalgamated in the series, are depicted in the film just as they were in the novels.—LA-Lawyer Set during the Korean War, surgeons Captains ""Hawkeye"" Pierce and ""Duke"" Forrest, join the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), located three miles from the front lines. Both are draftees and care little for military protocols and conventions. They are soon joined by another surgeon even more anarchic and insubordinate in his attitude, Capt. John ""Trapper"" McIntyre. The commander is the laid back-yet-efficient Lt. Colonel Blake. Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper soon have the camp running to their rather non-military tune but then run into Major Frank Burns and the new chief nurse Major Margaret Houlihan (later nicknamed ""Hot Lips""), both of whom are by-the-book permanent military types. Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper set out to undermine the pair. Highjinks ensue.—grantss/siegerrob76 Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. That's where two young surgeons, Duke and Hawkeye end up during the Korean War. There is no plot as such, but instead a series of episodes during which they put their stamp on the camp including a football game against a larger unit with thousands riding on it, a trip to Tokyo to operate on a congressman's son and play a little golf, and finding out if the head nurse is a natural blonde.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> It's August, 1951, the Korean War. Over the noise of incoming helicopters carrying wounded U.S. soldiers, Colonel Henry Blake (Roger Bowen), the commanding officer of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (M.A.S.H.), located just three miles from the front lines, is shouting at Corporal Radar O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), telling him to inform Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall), that one of the day surgeons will have to stay over on the night shift. He also needs to get word to Brigadier General Charles Hammond (G. Wood), in Seoul, that the 4077th needs two more surgeons, as the patient load is getting overwhelming. Radar says out loud everything Colonel Blake is telling him, but a split before Blake says it. That's the first of many instances where Radar proves always to be one step ahead of his commanding officer. Another enlisted man is trying to write it all down, but misses most of it. Blake tells him that Radar has it.Quotes pertaining to Korea, from both General MacArthur and General Eisenhower, scroll down the screen as Captain Hawkeye Pierce is shown exiting the Officers' Latrine in Seoul and approaching a Jeep for the next leg of his journey. He has just arrived in Korea for duty at the 4077th. He is originally from Maine.The motor pool sergeant (Jerry Jones), struts up to Hawkeye and says, ""What the hell do you think you're doing? Don't think that just because you're a captain, you run this place. I run this place!"" He tells Hawkeye that his driver is having his coffee and will be along when he's ready. Hawkeye, who is in the process of removing his collar devices from his uniform, is shocked and disbelieving about how rude and insubordinate the sergeant is. He mutters ""racist"" to himself as the sergeant walks away (the sergeant is black).Also newly arriving is Captain Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt). He's from Georgia. He approaches Hawkeye, who is sitting in a Jeep, waiting for the driver. Forrest mistakenly thinks Hawkeye is his driver and, after confirming that the Jeep is headed for the 4077th M.A.S.H. unit, he orders Hawkeye to take him there. Hawkeye says ok, puts the Jeep in gear and roars out of the compound.The motor pool sergeant watches as Hawkeye and Forrest tear out of the place and yells at two military policemen (MPs) to go get them. Something happens to the MPs Jeep, as there's a bang with smoke, and it stops, causing the sergeant to throw a fit and start punching and wrestling with the MPs.Hawkeye & Forrest prove to have a lot in common, in that they are both rebellious, womanizing, and mischievous rule-breakers. They arrive at the Officer's Mess tent at the 4077th and decide to go in for some lunch. They are already making eyes at some nurses. One in particular, Lt. Maria ""Dish"" Schneider (Jo Ann Pflug), attracts their attention and they sit down near her.Colonel Blake asks Captain Murrhardt (Danny Goldman) if he knows those two men who just came in. He does not. Another officer suggests they may be the new doctors, but the Colonel says that can't be, as the two new people are supposed to be really bright. He decides they are just a couple of moochers coming in for a free meal.Forrest is staring at Lt. Schneider and says, ""I think I am in love."" He tells her he's new in town, with nothing to do, and asks her to show him around the place if she's not doing anything tonight. She stays quiet, smiles and holds up her left hand. Hawkeye tells Forrest that the lady is wearing a wedding ring, but he doesn't let that dissuade him.Colonel Blake decides to go see what's up with these new guys. He learns that they are indeed the newest doctors assigned to his unit. The colonel tells Pierce that he'd received a message about him stealing a Jeep at Headquarters. Hawkeye tells the colonel that he didn't steal the Jeep, that it's right outside there. The colonel then sets about informing Forrest about the Army's regulations for proper reporting to a unit. Hawkeye is mostly interested in asking questions about how many people are on staff, especially nurses.The colonel decides to introduce the new captains to the existing staff who are in the mess at that moment. They include the Irish Catholic Chaplain, Father John ""Dago Red"" Mulcahy (Rene Auberjonois); the dental officer, Captain 'Painless Pole' Waldowsky (John Schuck); the anesthesiologist, Captain ""Ugly"" John Black (Carl Gottlieb), a.k.a., the ""gas passer""); Captain Dennis Patrick Bandini (Corey Fischer); and Corporal 'Radar' O'Reilly.Radar tells the captains he will change the identification number on the stolen Jeep, just before Colonel Blake orders him to do that.As Pierce and Forrest proceed with their check in, over near the officer's quarters and barber shop, they walk past a post covered with wooden arrows depicting the mileage and directions to various other cities in the world. Duke lays claim to a pretty blonde nurse who walks past, but after Radar whispers in Hawkeye's ear and Hawkeye in turn whispers in Duke's ear, he realizes that Colonel Blake's girlfriend, Lt. Leslie (Indus Arthur), is ""hands off.""Radar leads them to their tent and inside is Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) and a South Korean boy, Ho-Jon (Kim Atwood), who works at the mess hall. Major Burns is teaching Ho Jon how to read, using the Bible. Major Burns will prove to be both a religious man and an inferior surgeon.Captain Forrest slips Ho-Jon a girlie magazine, telling him that it helps when learning how to read to have some pictures to go along with the words. Ho-Jon avoids letting Major Burns see what Forrest gave him and he quickly excuses himself and leaves the tent with the magazine.In the first of many scenes from the M.A.S.H. operating room, the new captains are performing surgeries on two patients. They both have a matter-of-fact attitude as they go about their life and death work, speaking and moving around much like a chef preparing a meal might do. Hawkeye is preparing to saw off a soldier's lower leg while Captain Forrest is hitting on one of the nurses.Frequent announcements come over the camp public announcement (PA) system. They are usually given by SSgt. Wade Douglas Vollmer, (David Arkin), who can't read very well. The first announcement is for all non-commissioned officers to report for a short-arm inspection at 0400. (short-arm inspection refers to the medical inspection of male soldiers' penises, or ""short arm"", for signs of sexually-transmitted diseases and other medical problems).Major Burns enters his tent to find Ho-Jon serving martinis to Pierce and Forrest. Burns lets them know how inappropriate he considers that to be and he grabs his Bible and starts praying. Ho-Jon escapes to go do some laundry. Pierce and Forrest waste no time in starting to tease and mock Major Burns about his obsession with the Bible and religion. They speculate that he suffers from some sort of syndrome and wonder if he's always had it or just since he arrived in Korea. Forrest asks how long ""the show"" is going to last and Burns says that it gets longer all the time, now that he has Forrest's and Pierce's souls to pray for. Hawkeye and Duke start singing, ""Onward Christian Soldiers,"" as Burns keeps on praying. Soon, people outside the tent hear the singing and they join in, marching in a line as they sing.Colonel Blake receives a report from Lt. Leslie about the status of the patients currently at the M.A.S.H. as he sits at his desk tying a fishing fly. Leslie also assists him by handing him various tools that he needs.Hawkeye and Forrest come into the colonel's office and demand that he get the ""Sky Pilot"" Major Burns out of their tent (it's been one week). They also tell Blake that they need to have a ""chest cutter"" (thoracic surgeon) to properly tend to the injured soldiers. Blake tells them he'll have Burns out of their tent within 24 hours, and he'll try his best to get a chest cutter.Colonel Blake seems to empathize with the fact that most of his men and women there at the 4077th are draftees, they have very stressful jobs trying to save lives, and therefore he does very little by way of asserting discipline to keep his staff at the mobile hospital in line with military regulations.Father Mulcahy often hangs around surgery, either to administer last rites, pray, or sometimes assist the doctors. This particular time, he gets called over to administer last rites to a soldier who died on the surgical table, but gets interrupted and is asked by Duke Forrest to come over and hold a surgical retractor being used on another patient. When Mulcahy hesitates, Forrest apologizes, but points out to Dago that the first soldier is dead, while the one they are operating on is still alive.Hawkeye is busy making out with Lt. Dish in the Officer's Club when Ho-Jon comes knocking at the tent door. He tells Hawkeye to come quick, that the new chest cutter has arrived. Hawkeye and the nurse separate, frustrated, but duty calls.Forrest is sitting in his tent with the new chest cutter and complains to Hawkeye that all he has been able to learn is that the new surgeon is from ""Bastin"" (Boston) and has been in the Army for 2 months. As the new doctor is putting up a photo of a pin-up girl, Hawkeye attempts to find out more about him, but the new guy continues be very evasive. As they sit down to have some martinis, and the new doc produces a bottle of green olives from inside his jacket. Hawkeye is amused and impressed. He tells the new man that he looks familiar, but he can't quite place where he knows him from.The new doctor's first operation in surgery attracts a sizable audience, inside and outside the operating room, as everyone is curious as to how he'll do. He does just fine.Other than the frequent PA announcements, Radio Tokyo is often playing throughout the camp, with Japanese announcers and singers providing entertainment in broken English.The staff frequently toss a football around between the tents in the compound and the play can be quite vigorous. One guy performs a flying tackle on the man with the ball, and they both splash down hard into a mud puddle. When the ball flies out of the hands of the man being tackled, it is caught by the new thoracic surgeon. He makes as though to fake a handoff to Duke, then rolls left while Duke runs behind and out the opposite side of a tent, with Hawkeye defending. The new surgeon lobs an off target pass and Hawkeye jumps up and intercepts it. That prompts an immediate recall in Hawkeye's mind. He now knows who the new guy is as he rushes forward, proclaiming it's ""Trapper John McIntyre, former quarterback for Dartmouth University. Hawkeye played in a game for Androscoggin College, against Dartmouth and McIntyre, and he intercepted a pass thrown by Trapper John, enabling Androscoggin to win the game, 6-0.Hawkeye also tells Duke that Trapper got his nickname as a result of cornering a girl in the restroom of a railroad car, and when the conductor caught them in there, the girl screamed, ""He trapped me!'The enlisted all line up outside the shower tent to get a peek at Dr. Captain ""Painless Pole"" Waldowsky as he's showering. The attraction is the captain's sexual apparatus, which is apparently of unusually large proportions. Corporal Judson, from Mississippi, takes his turn at the peephole. As he walks away, he says to a shocked looking Private Lorenzo Boone (Bud Cort), ""Ah'd purely love to see that angry!""A small group, led by Colonel Blake (in his civilian winter coat), goes out to meet an incoming helicopter. On board is Major Margaret Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), the new Chief Nurse for the 4077th.Major Burns is tending to a male patient who suddenly goes into cardiac arrest. Burns calls for a nurse and proceeds to do a couple of unenthusiastic thumps on the patient's chest. When there's no nurse at hand, he directs Private Boone, who's just a teenage orderly, to go grab a cardiac needle and some adrenaline. Boone is hesitant, as he's not sure where to find those things, but he tries. The soldier dies right about then, and when Boone returns with a regular needle and hands it to Burns, Burns calls him an idiot and tells him he wanted a cardiac needle. Boone asks Burns if he wants him to get a nurse and Burns says, ""it's too late, Boone, you killed him."" Boone feels horrible and goes away in tears. Trapper observes all this and a short while later he approaches Burns and asks him if he's done for the day. When Burns says yes, Trapper says, ""good, I just wanted to make sure you'll have time to sleep this off,"" and he lands a haymaker right hand across Burns' head. Burns crashes into some boxes of Tampax while Trapper grimaces in pain as he grips his right hand with his left. At the same moment, Colonel Blake and Major Houlihan pass by and are shocked at what they witness. They demand to know what's going on. Burns asks for them to leave he and Trapper alone and let them settle things, but Blake tells SSgt. Vollmer to arrest Trapper and confine him to his quarters.Before happening on the fight between Trapper and Burns, Blake had introduced Major Houlihan (he called her ""O'Houlihan"") to the people in the operating room. Among those there are Captain Dana Murrhardt (Danny Goldman), Captain Black, Captain Judson Sax, Captain Scorch (Dawne Damon), and Captain Bridget ""Knocko"" McCarthy (Tamara Wilcox-Smith).Henry wants to make Trapper the head surgeon, but feels the fight with Major Burns necessitates that he wait for a week or the new chief nurse will likely make a stink about it.Blake and Lt. Leslie are out on a small stream near camp and he's flycasting. Vollmer runs up to inform the colonel that General Hammond can't answer the phone as he's at a football game. Blake complains that the generals have all the fun.Margaret joins Hawkeye at his table in the mess tent. He asks her where she's from and she tells him she likes to think of the Army as her home. She then asks Hawkeye how he likes the nurses who work on his team. He tells her he likes them fine. She tells him that Major Burns does not think much of the nurses, to which Hawkeye responds that Burns is a lousy surgeon and an idiot. Margaret strongly disagrees. She thinks Burns is a fine doctor and military man. Margaret also think it's very unprofessional that people call Captain Pierce, ""Hawkeye."" Hawkeye tells Major Houlihan that she's what he and others call ""a typical, uptight, career Army clown,"" as he loses his appetite and gets up to go to his tent.On occasion, the lights in the operating room go out. When that happens, several enlisted staff position themselves with flashlights so the doctors can keep working. In one instance, the doctors and nurses started singing ""When the Lights Go On Again,"" a song written in 1942, during WWII.Blake leaves the camp overnight to go see General Hammond over at the 325th Evac Hospital and he leaves Major Burns in charge. There's a big party in the mess tent for Trapper, to celebrate his being named the camp's new chief surgeon. Margaret and Frank are not impressed, especially when Trapper calls out for Margaret, the ""sultry bitch"" to be stripped of her clothes and brought to him for sex.Frank and Margaret collaborate on a typewritten letter to General Hammond, complaining about the lack of discipline and order at the 4077th. After they finish, Frank notes that it's dinnertime and Margaret asks if he's hungry. ""For you, Margaret,"" and they attack each other with passion and engage in a dry hump, but only briefly.There's a PA announcement that three cases of amphetamine sulfate (central nervous system stimulant) have disappeared and this is the third time this sort of thing has happened in the last month and it must stop by order of Colonel Blake's office. Burns escorts Margaret to her tent and offers to stop by and check on her later. She says that won't be necessary but she also says she'll leave the door unlocked. When he comes by later, they exchange empathy with one another for how poorly the others in camp treat them, and how disrespectful they are. Frank then says he thinks God willed them to find each other. Margaret throws open her pajama top, exposing her breasts and says, ""His will be done,"" and Frank plants his face on her breasts and they fall onto the bed. As they struggle to get their clothes off, Radar lifts up the bottom of the tent and places the microphone to the camp's PA system under the bed. At first, the sounds are transmitted only to location of the PA equipment in Henry Blake's office, where a handful of people are listening in. Trapper then decides the rest of the camp should hear it and an enlisted man flips a switch to broadcast it.Margaret is panting and tells Frank that her lips are hot, asking him to kiss her hot lips. Hawkeye, busy doing surgery, wonders what those sounds are and soon figures it out. He says, ""it sounds like Frank Burns is doing a bit of dilitation and curretage."" Before long, Margaret can hear her own voice over the PA system and that quickly brings the lovemaking session to an end.The next morning in the mess tent, Forrest says, ""well, hi, Hot Lips,"" as she gets all flustered and has to leave the tent. Hawkeye sits down across the table from Frank and taunts Frank by asking if he'd heard from his wife. About then, Colonel Blake returns to camp and Radar directs him over to the window of the mess tent, behind where Hawkeye and Burns are sitting. Blake peers in and it warms his heart to see the two finally sitting down together to have a talk.Hawkeye says to Frank that he and the other guys wonder how Hot Lips is in the sack, ""is she better than self-abuse?"" He asks Frank, ""does that big ass of her move around a lot, or does it just sort of lie there, flaccid? What would you say about that?""Blake wonders what they are saying. Radar looks and says Hawkeye is making a point about human anatomy. Blake is impressed at how professional the conversation is, how they are exchanging ideas.After Hawkeye asks if Hot Lips is a moaner or does she just lie there quietly, Frank launches himself across the table at Hawkeye and they fall to the ground, Hawkeye yelling for help. As they struggle, Trapper tells Hawkeye to look out for his goodies, as Frank is a sex maniac and he didn't think Hot Lips satisfied him. Several others in the area hurry to pull Frank off Hawkeye. Frank is put in a strait jacket and taken away by the MPs as Father Mulcahy attempts to read to him from a small scripture book. Frank won't be coming back, he's being shipped back to the states. Duke asks the colonel if he nails Hot Lips and punches Hawkeye, can he go home?In surgery, Hawkeye has to move quickly to stop a soldier's spurting neck artery, as an announcement comes over the PA system about the American Medical Association declaring marijuana to be a dangerous drug.Father Mulcahy tells Hawkeye that ""Painless Pole"" Waldowski has consulted him about a problem. Though Mulcahy feels unable to divulge any details (Waldowski had come to him in confession), he makes clear the severity of the problem. by explaining to Hawkeye that when one of the men asked for a ruling in the poker game they were playing, the captain said, ""what does it matter, it's only a game?"" Hawkeye wastes no time in going over to see Waldowski in his tent.Waldowski confides in Hawkeye that he has suffered a ""lack of performance"" (impotence) with a visiting nurse after a sexual encounter. He tells Hawkeye that he's distraught over how he will ever be able to tell his three fiancées back home. Hawkeye tells Waldowski that occasional impotence is not a problem, and nothing for the ""dental Don Juan"" of Detroit to worry about. Waldowski tells Hawkeye that he's been reading up on it and Don Juanism is just a cover up. He thinks he's a fairy, a victim of latent homosexuality, and he can't deal with it.The next day, the other doctors are sitting around joking about Waldoski's concerns. He enters the tent as they smirk and giggle and tells them all he knows they were talking about him. He announces that he's going to commit suicide. Bandidi jokingly asks Waldoski if he can have his record player. He says sure. Then he asks for suggestions about how best to go about killing himself. Trapper says, ""the black capsule,"" which is what Adolph Hitler and Eva Braun used. Trapper claims to be able to provide a capsule for him.Hawkeye asks Father Mulcahy to perform last rites for Waldoski . He's hoping that if they conduct an end of life ceremony for him, he'll get scared and decide he wants to live. The doctors, administrative officers, chopper pilots and enlisted men all form up for the ceremony, a replica of the Last Supper, with a coffin placed in front of the table. Someone plays a scratchy version of ""Taps"" on a violin. Dago Red performs a quick absolution and Trapper gives a black capsule (actually a sleeping pill) to Waldoski. Waldoski figures that he'd better go lie down in the coffin, since the pill is supposed to work pretty fast. He gets in and immediately swallows the capsule with some wine. Everyone one files by to say goodbyes or leave little mementos with Waldoski. Among the items presented to him are some poker cards, a fifth of scotch, some basic dental instruments and the photographs of his three fiancées. Finally, he goes to sleep as Corporal Judson (Timothy Brown) sings ""Suicide is Painless.""A group of men carry the coffin to the Officer's Club and Waldoski is placed in a bed, complete with mood lighting. Hawkeye is outside making out with Lt. Schneider, who is scheduled to transfer out within 12 hours. Hawkeye asks her to do him a favor, to meet her professional obligations as a nurse, and go in and lie down with Waldoski, to help him with a potentially fatal psychological condition. She's not wanting to do it, but once she lifts up the edge of the sheet and sees what Waldoski has down below, she changes her mind.Captain Waldoski was in a very good mood the next morning, a new and improved man, seemingly having forgotten he supposedly had died the night before, and Lt. Schneider flew out on a helicopter, with a big smile on her face.Hawkeye and Trapper need some A-negative blood for a Korean prisoner of war with a chest wound they are operating on, but Radar said their requests for A-negative blood are never fulfilled. The operation proceeds and Radar goes to see a sleeping Colonel Blake. Radar sits next to the bed and monitors a tube extending from Blake's arm. A pint of blood is harvested from the colonel while he's sleeping (he's obviously type A-). Radar delivers a pint of blood to the operating room just as the surgeons were about to be forced to go on without it, at great risk to the patient.During the operation, Trapper is being assisted by Margaret and he says, ""Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass, but you're a damn good nurse.""Captain Forrest likes blondes, but strongly disagrees with Hawkeye who speculates that Duke is attracted to Hot Lips. Duke says he nearly pukes every time he sees Hot Lips. He thinks she's probably not even a true blonde and decides to bet Hawkeye $20 that she isn't. They conspire on a plan to isolate Hot Lips in the women's shower and then expose her so they can see what color her pubic hair is. Everyone in the camp, including a dog, take seats outside the shower tent and when they are ready, Waldoski clangs two metal lids together and a soldier releases a sandbag connected to some ropes and the sides of the tent all fly up. Hot Lips had been singing in the shower, but when she discovers everyone is looking at her, she screams and falls to the ground, covering herself. She crawls over and gets a towel and, in hysterics, she storms off to see Colonel Blake. She's furious as she tears open the door to the Colonel's tent and finds him inside, lying in bed with Lt. Leslie. She screams at him that the camp is an insane asylum and that it's his fault for letting the doctors get away with practically anything. She threatens to resign her commission if Blake doesn't turn Duke and Hawkeye over to the MPs. Blake listens and becomes angry, telling Houlihan, ""Goddamit Hot Lips, resign your goddamn commission!"" Houlihan dejectedly turns and leaves, sobbing ""My commission, my commission.....""Duke won the bet with Hawkeye. Margaret was not a natural blonde.Ho-Jon receives notice to report for an induction physical for the South Korean Army. Hawkeye, along with fellow co-workers Boone, Bandini, and Nurse Scorch, drive him to the induction center in Seoul for his physical. Hawkeye dopes him up with some drugs that temporarily give him a fast heart beat and high blood pressure. The doctor examining him is at first concerned, then figures out what's going on. He goes outside and informs Hawkeye that he will be keeping Ho Jon for a couple of days and retesting him. He says to Hawkeye, ""nice try."" Hawkeye reluctantly has to let Ho-Jon go.A helicopter pilot arrives at the 4077th, looking for Captain McIntyre. A soldier who'd been doing some training in Japan was accidentally wounded when a grenade went off and some shrapnel got into his heart. Some big time heart surgeon in Boston told the kid's father, a Congressman, that Trapper John was the only surgeon in the theater who might be able to save his boy. Trapper is ordered to proceed to Kokura, Japan, to do the operation. After looking at the x-rays, Trapper realizes that just about anyone could remove the shrapnel, as it's not threatening the boy's heart, but he decides there's a free trip to Tokyo in the offing, plus General Hammond said in the orders to Trapper that he could bring an assistant, so he invites Hawkeye. They view it as an opportunity to do some golfing.Trapper and Hawkeye are driven past a golf course on their way to the hospital in Japan and they are pretending to be speaking Japanese. Their driver is Sgt. Gorman (Bobby Troupe), who doesn't view the task of escorting these two as appropriate to his skill set and he curses the army.At the hospital, the pair waste no time in upsetting just about every person they come into contact with, both medical and non-medical staff alike, as they order the congressman's son into surgery. Trapper tells Captain Peterson (Cathleen Cordell) to prepare the patient and find him a nurse who can work in close without getting her tits in the way. They are equally disrespectful to the straight-laced commander of the hospital, Colonel Wallace C. Merrill (James B. Douglas), ordering him to leave the operating room when he comes in to criticize their behavior.When the anesthetist for the operation, Captain E.B. ""Me Lay"" Marston (Michael Murphy), tells Hawkeye to save his rapier like wit for the clam diggers back home, Hawkeye suddenly recognizes it's an old acquaintance of his. Hawkeye had once told Trapper John how one of his friend's back home got the nick-name ""Me Lay"" by saying to girls, ""Me lay, you lay,"" and it would enable him to score with about 1 of every 50 of the girls.Trapper and Hawkeye quickly finish the surgery, but on the way out of the hospital, they are followed by two MPs. They think they are escaping through a door, but when they close it and turn around, they find themselves in the Colonel Merrill's outer office, where another MP is sitting and waiting for them. They are directed into Colonel Merrill's office to wait for him to appear. They still have their golf clubs with them, so they take advantage of the wait by practicing their putting.When Colonel Merrill comes in, he threatens to have Hawkeye and Trapper court martialed. They remind him that they bailed him out with the Congressman by operating on his son and if Merrill decides to press the matter, they will call and tell the Congressman their side of the story and the colonel can tell his side. They tell the colonel they will hang around one more day to golf and check on the Congressman's son, and he can contact them at the golf course if he wants them. Then Hawkeye uses the butt end of his putter to push the colonel back into his chair and off they go.Dr. Marston invites Hawkeye and Trapper to come check out Dr. Yamachi's New Era Hospital and Whorehouse, where Marston moonlights as a doctor. As the three later sit with some Geisha girls and eat a meal at the facility, a nurse comes in and speaks with Me Lay, telling him that a Japanese-American baby boy was having trouble breathing and needed help. Based only on a description of the symptoms, Trapper and Hawkeye decide to schedule surgery for the boy back at the Army hospital. Hawkeye has already diagnosed the problem as a tracheal-esophageal fistula. He tells Dr. Marston not to tell the hospital who the surgery is for, because it is against the rules. However, when Colonel Merrill finds out what's going on, he comes into the operating room and throws a fit, prompting the doctors to clamp a surgical gas mask over his face and put him to sleep, then they complete the operation on the child.While the Colonel is still asleep, one of the Geisha girls, Michiko (Hiroko Watanabe) is put with him in a bed and some compromising photos are taken to assure that the Colonel will remain quiet about everything that had transpired.On their return to the 4077th from Japan, Hawkeye and Trapper (still wearing their newly purchased golf attire) immediately go into surgery for several hours. Finally with a chance to go their tent, now nicknamed ""The Swamp,"" they find the flaps on the windows down and the door locked so they bang on the door. Duke's face appears at the window and he wants to know what the hell they are doing back already. He tells them to wait a minute. Hawkeye and Trapper figure something's up, so they start around towards the back of the tent and see a shirtless Forrest trying to smuggle Hot Lips away under a blanket. When the blanket falls off, they say hello to Hot Lips and ask her if she missed them. As she scurries away, Duke just looks at Trapper and Hawkeye and shrugs. Apparently non-blondes are ok with him after all.General Hammond calls Colonel Blake to tell him the battle for Old Baldy was all over (the battle that was responsible for so many wounded). He ignores Henry's inquiry as to who won, instead telling him he got a rather disturbing report from Major ""O'Houlihan"" about things taking place at the 4077th that he finds hard to believe. Blake says, ""well, don't believe them then...goodbye"" and he hangs up the phone.General Hammond makes a trip over to the 4077th to check on things for himself. The first thing he does is join the surgeons out under a camouflage net for some martinis. They discuss Major Houlihan. Trapper tells the general that Colonel Blake can't be blamed for Hot Lips not being able to stand her name. When Hawkeye tells the general that Hot Lips is a regular Army fanatic who won't even let them play football, that gets the general's attention, as he loves football. He asks if the 4077th has a football team. Hawkeye starts to say no, but Trapper John interjects and says yes. Hammond mentions that his team at the 325th Evac (he's the head coach) is currently scheduling games for the upcoming season. They like to play games against other units and bet on the outcomes. When he says the bets are typically in the $5,000-$6,000 range, Hawkeye nearly chokes, but the general has already decided to go speak with Colonel Blake about it.Trapper observes that the general has five times the manpower to draw his football players from. Hawkeye thinks they can deal with that by finding a ""ringer"" to help them. He knows an Army neurosurgeon named Oliver Harmon Jones, a.k.a. ""Spearchucker"" who used to play for the San Francisco 49ers. If they can get Henry to put in a special request for Dr. Jones, then he could be on their football team. Forrest, being from Georgia, is concerned about potential social problems, as Jone's would be the only black officer in camp. Hawkeye tells Duke they'd just stick him in the Swamp with them.The general goes to see Blake and tell him about the football game plan. Henry is taken aback. ""Football? Gambling? What about Houlihan?"" The general says, ""ya mean Hot Lips? Screw her!""So, ""Spearchucker"" (a nickname from his days as a javelin thrower) shows up at the 4077th and Colonel Blake assumes the role as head coach. He organizes the first practice and just as he's beginning his first coaching lesson (about the three basic principles of football: organization, discipline and teamwork), Dr. Jones interrupts and asks if they can all limber up first. Henry decides that's a good idea and asks Spearchucker to organize that.The team is put through a pretty rigorous training camp, just like any normal football team would go through. Hot Lips also participates by organizing a squad of nurses as cheerleaders.Trapper is the team's quarterback. Spearchucker is a running back. Spearchucker presents Colonel Blake with seven or eight plays that he drew up, telling the coach that he figured that's about the maximum number of plays their team could handle.As for the bet, Hawkeye suggests they bet $2,500 on the first half, in which Spearchucker won't play, then get new odds for the 2nd half and put Spearchucker in. Everyone agrees that's a good idea.On game day, the 325th Evac team is dressed in blue uniforms and the 4077th M.A.S.H. is in red jerseys and white helmets with red crosses on the front and back. The field is well manicured green grass and well marked. The referees are very official looking. There are cheerleaders for both teams and bleachers on one side of the field, filled with spectators.The 4077th kicks off and a flashy little runner for the 325th returns the ball for a touchdown. Spearchucker knows him as ""Super Bug"" (Noland Smith) and tells the others that Super Bug played for the L.A. Rams. Spearchucker tells his teammates they have to get Super Bug out of the game. Meanwhile, the general is telling his defensive star, a huge lineman, #88 (Ben Davidson) to go easy on the 4077th players so as not to run up the score.The 4077th's first play from scrimmage sees the ball snapped way over Trapper's head and he falls on it in the end zone for a safety.Radar serves as the water boy. He brings out a syringe and hands it to anesthesiologist Black who tucks it into his belt. After Super Bug returns the next kickoff for another touchdown, Dr. Black injects him in the arm, even using an alcohol swab first, while he's still on the ground. Within seconds, Super Bug becomes disoriented and falls down. On the sideline, he starts talking about the next race. He thinks they are all participating in a track meet.The ""Painless Pole"" tells the huge player opposite him, ""All right, Bud, this time your fucking head is coming right off!"" but he's the one who gets hammered.It's 16-0 at halftime and when the gun goes off signaling the end of the half, Super Bug mistakes it for a starter's gun and takes off in a sprint and runs into his team's cheerleaders, knocking them all over.Henry begins a rallying halftime speech when Hawkeye reminds him that he needs to go take care of the second half bet with General Hammond, so Blake stops talking and he and Radar go over to the 325th's locker room.The 325th's #88 takes a big mouthful of water and purposely directs a stream of water at Radar's head as they sit around observing the colonel and general discuss terms of the bet. Radar just looks like a sad little puppy dog as he is forced to suffer through the insult.The general and colonel decide to double the bet for the 2nd half.Spearchucker enters the game for the 4077th and returns the 2nd half kickoff for a touchdown. The extra point attempt is blocked. The general demands to know who the that new guy is and one of the players on the 325th tells him it's Spearchucker Jones who played for the 49ers. The general yells at Blake from across the field, accusing him of bringing in a ringer. Blake couldn't make out what the general said, so he asks Radar. Radar says, ""His ringer identified our ringer."" Blake shouts back, ""How do ya like them apples, Charlie?""The second half is brutal, as numerous players from both side are injured and carted off the field. Several 325th Evac players are sharing a marijuana joint on the bench during the game. The general occasionally gets distracted looking at his team's cheerleaders.The 4077th cheerleaders stand right behind Colonel Blake throughout the game and he often gets frustrated with them. He once yells at Hot Lips, calling her a ""blithering idiot"" because she's cheering for everything that happens: injuries and penalties, as well as scores or good plays. When the gun goes off at the end of the third quarter, at the same time a 4077th player is being tackled, Hot Lips shouts out, ""oh, my God, they shot him!""Blue team's #88 calls the 4077th's #69 a ""coon,"" as he's black. #69 wants to fight #88, but gets chastised by Spearchucker for risking a penalty and ejection. Spearchucker knows something about #88 from pro football camp, so he advises #69 to use the fact that #88 has a sister named Gladys to turn the tables and piss him off instead. So, before the snap of the ball on the next play, #69 says something, causing #88 to level him. #69 jumps up and runs the opposite direction, with #88 in hot pursuit. They run all the way down the field before the refs and other catch up to them. #88 is ejected from the game as the 4077th cheerleaders start chanting, ""69 is divine.""The 4077th scores on a TD pass, but the extra point is muffed. The score is 16-12. It comes down to the last play of the game. Spearchucker tells the team that he spoke with the umpire and they will run a special ""center eligible"" play, where the center, SSgt. Vollmer, will hike the ball to Trapper, but then bring the ball right back between his legs and tuck it under his shirt as Trapper and the rest of the players carry out a fake. The play works, even after Vollmer runs over to the sideline to show Coach Blake that he actually has the ball, then he continues on down the sideline and, thanks to a block from Spearchucker, scores a touchdown. Final score: 4077th - 18, 325th -16.The 4077th team rolls back into camp, all drunk. Later, there's a big poker game in a tent and in the background a dead soldier is being loaded into the back of a Jeep and taken away, bringing the reality of their situation back in focus.There's a little yellow camp dog that Hawkeye often plays with. He calls it ""pup-pup."" He's petting the dog when he receives word from Radar that prompts him to rush over to the operating room and inform Forrest that they both had received orders to go home. Forrest can't celebrate right away, as he's assisting Dr. Jones in brain surgery.Father Mulcahy blesses the Jeep that Forrest and Hawkeye will leave in. After some quick goodbyes, Duke and Hawkeye jump in a Jeep, and just as when they arrived in Korea, they don't wait for their designated driver. Hawkeye drives and they roar out of camp. Blake asks Radar if Hawkeye just stole that Jeep and Radar says no, that it's the same Jeep they arrived in.The PA Announcer reads the end credits as the movie ends."
Patton,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066206/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The World War II phase of the career of controversial American generalGeorge S. Patton. ""Patton"" tells the tale of GeneralGeorge S. Patton, famous tank commander of World War II. The film begins with Patton's career in North Africa and progresses through the invasion of Europe and the fall of the Third Reich. Side plots also speak of Patton's numerous faults such his temper and tendency toward insubordination, faults that would prevent him from becoming the lead American general in the Normandy Invasion as well as to his being relieved as Occupation Commander of Germany.—Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> Biopic of the famed - many would say infamous - World War II GeneralGeorge S. Patton, Jr. The story begins in North Africa with his appointment as the commanding general of II Corps soon after their devastating defeat at the hands of Rommel's Afrika Korps at Kasserine Pass. After leading II Corps during the invasion of Sicily, Patton faced one of his severest tests when, after slapping a hospitalized soldier suffering from battle fatigue, he is reprimanded and forced to publicly apologize. It and other faux pas ultimately leads to Patton being relieved and not being assigned to command again until several months after D-Day where he takes charge of the U.S. Third Army. Patton is portrayed as a prima donna and a hardened no-nonsense commander whose main objective is always to win - regardless of the cost which in these circumstances was mostly in the form of human lives.—garykmcd Biography of controversial World War II hero GeneralGeorge S. Patton. The film covers his wartime activities and accomplishments, beginning with his entry into the North African campaign and ending with his removal from command after his outspoken criticism of US post-war military strategy.—Jwelch5742 The story of GeneralGeorge S. Patton, Jr. during World War II. His battlefield genius garners him fear and respect from the Germans, and resentment and misunderstanding from the Allies. A military historian and poet, he believes he was a warrior in many past lives, and that he is destined for something great during this life, but his stubbornness and controversial methods nearly prevent the fulfillment of that destiny.—Jeff Hansen <jmh@umich.edu> Against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes, General George S. Patton (George C. Scott) addresses his troops on the eve of battle. His uniform is impeccable, his medals uncountable, and his ramrod demeanor unassailable. As he speaks to the men about to embark on their first great adventure, his manner runs the gamut from stern, to jovial, amused, profane and reverent. To Patton, it is obvious that war is the greatest expression of the human condition.North Africa, 1942: In their first encounter with Rommel's Africa Corps, the Americans are badly beaten. In the post-battle assessment, Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) decides what's needed is the best tank commander they've got. Patton answers the call and arrives amid wailing sirens and a cloud of dust. He's also early and catches most of the soldiers off guard, a mistake they quickly learn not to make again. Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat, he quickly begins to set things to rights. Patton's belief in himself is unshakable, and there's only one way to get things done-his way. Quickly establishing discipline and routine, he commands his men with an iron fist. He also has great respect for the Germans he's up against, and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the field.In Berlin, the Germans are also assessing Patton. His reputation is considerable, and they study his idiosyncracies looking for a clue to the man's character. They note he is a romantic, reads the Bible daily, swears like a stableboy, and believes in reincarnation. Rommel, when asked what he intends to do about Patton, simply replies ""I will attack and annihilate him.....before he does the same to me.""Soon the Germans move against the American positions in Tunisia, and Patton watches in fascination from his command post in the hills nearby. Anticipating Rommel's plan, he routs the Germans, and gives the Americans their first victory, further inflating his ego. North Africa now has two prima donnas; Patton, and the equally egotistical British commander, Field Marshal Montgomery (Michael Bates). Naturally, they come to dislike each other intensely, and as the African campaign draws to a close, plans are made for the invasion of Italy. Patton wines and dines the appropriate officals, and pitches his own plan to invade through Sicily. Montgomery has other plans, and when Monty's are adopted over his own, Patton, outraged, vows to outdo the Field Marshal at all costs.Sicily is invaded, and Montgomery's troops fight their way up the East coast against heavy German resistance. Patton is assigned the support role of guarding Montomery's flank, but soon adopts another plan and begins to push across the island, taking the long way around. First taking Palermo, then pushing East to Messina, he races Montgomery to the finish line, pushing his men to the breaking point and creating dissension among his commanders. They do not wish to sacrifice more American casualties to Patton's ego.Soon, Montgomery and the British forces march into the liberated city of Messina amid the cheering populace. Flags wave and the pipers play as they march triumphantly into the town square; Monty has done it. He's driven the Germans out of Sicily and beaten Patton to the punch. Abruptly, the pipers falter, and fall silent. Monty quickly marches to the fore to investigate, and finds Patton, his tanks and troops neatly arrayed behind him, standing there silently with an insufferable smile on his lips. He'd arrived hours ago, and was waiting only to greet his old rival.As the Italian campaign continues, Patton becomes more controversial. During a routine inspection of wounded men in a field hospital, he encounters a shell-shocked soldier crying in a corner and becomes enraged with what he perceives as a display of cowardice. Slapping the soldier, he rages at him and orders him sent back to the front. This outburst gets Patton the first serious setback he's ever experienced. A rebuke from his commander and an order to apologize to all concerned quickly follow, a bitter pill indeed for the general. Forced to swallow his pride, he stands before the assembled troops and tersely gives his explanation, then turns on his heel and marches away.The war grinds on. Patton is called to England prior to D-Day, and believes he will be commanding the invasion, but finds that his big mouth and bigger ego have gotten him into too much trouble. He's become a liability to the fragile alliance Eisenhower is trying to hold together to fight the Germans, so Patton's orders are to shut up and stay out of trouble. Chafing at what may be his last chance to be in a great battle, he'll do anything to get back in the game. Arriving in France days after the invasion, he meets with General Bradley again, who puts Patton on probation and gives him a chance to redeem himself. Grateful for the opportunity, Patton quickly shows the rest of the world what he can do, chasing the Germans clear across France, and gaining more ground in less time than any other allied outfit.Christmas approaches, and the Germans mount a final major counter-attack at the Battle of the Bulge. Caught off guard, the American troops are trapped and surrounded, and only a miracle can save them. Patton vows to provide one. Marching his men north at breakneck speed, he amazingly arrives in time and relieves the trapped Americans, grabbing the limelight once more. Now it's on to Germany, and as the war winds down, Patton becomes despondent at the impending cessation of hostilities. All too soon, Patton's mouth gets him in trouble again as he first snubs the Russians, and then compares the defeated Nazis to other political parties in the U.S. Another uproar ensues, and Eisenhower is forced to relieve Patton once again.Having proved himself one of the greatest military commanders of WWII, he now faces a future and a world that no longer need him. Recalling history, he ruminates: ""For over a thousand years, Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of a triumph - a tumultuous parade. The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children, robed in white, stood with him in the chariot, or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror, holding a golden crown, and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is fleeting."""

Above all, will crafty Edgar get what's coming to him?—Nick Riganas Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a retired opera singer and a kind-hearted yet loving owner of Duchess and her beloved kittens of Toulouse, Marie, and Berlioz. Madame Bonfamille is preparing her will with her lawyer Georges Hautecourt, she plans on leaving her inheritance to her cats and then Edgar. Unfortunately the decision doesn't sit well with Edgar and he plots a scheme to abandon Duchess and her kittens in the French countryside so he can inherit the fortune for himself. Edgar apparently succeeds in abandoning the cats by sedating their cream with sleeping pills. Duchess and her kittens get help from Thomas O'Malley, an easy-going stray cat who takes a liking to Duchess and her three kittens.—dawsonpersi The beloved, pampered housecat of a retired opera star in 1910 Paris finds herself stranded in the countryside with her three kittens, the victims of a plot by their owner's butler to cheat them out of a huge inheritance. They must find their way back to their home and owner, with the help of an independent-minded tomcat and other animal accomplices, while evading the butler and foiling his plan.—scgary66 In Paris, France, wealthy and aging socialite Madame Adelaide Bonfamille lives with her cat Duchess, and Duchess' three kittens: Berlioz, Toulouse, and Marie. Also in her employ is a butler, named Edgar.One day, Madame sends for her friend, George Hautecourt. The task is to finalize and make up Madame's will. Unknown to the two of them, Edgar is listening in. Madame notes that she has no living relatives, and considers her cats to be just as much a part of her family as anything else. As Edgar listens, he's shocked that Madam is planning to give her entire fortune to them, with the estate to be turned over to Edgar once the cats expire.Of course, Edgar is not at all happy about this, as the cats will easily outlive him! Edgar slips some sleeping pills in the cat's daily serving of cream, and once they have passed out, and night has fallen, he takes them out to the countryside, attempting to abandon them. However, his plans are ruined when a pair of dogs named Lafayette and Napoleon give chase. Edgar abandons the cats in a field before heading back to Paris.The next day, the cats awaken to find themselves not in their home, but in the countryside, and soon meet a cat named Thomas O'Malley. After some talk, O'Malley offers to help get the family back to Madame Bonfamille.Meanwhile, back in Paris, a house-mouse in Madam Bonfamille's residence named Rocquefort confirs with Madame's coach horse, Frou-Frou. Both are unsure what has become of their friends, when Edgar comes into Frou-Frou's stables very chipper. As Frou-Frou can't talk, Edgar shows her the headline from the morning's paper, telling of a mysterious catnapper taking off with Duchess and her children. Edgar seems to think he's gotten away with his little crime...until he realizes that he left his hat and umbrella out in the countryside, and quickly rushes out to retrieve them.Meanwhile, Thomas, Duchess and the kids hitch a ride on a milk truck, before being found out by the driver. They next attempt to follow a train track, until a train causes them to dive off. However, little Marie gets swept up in a nearby river. Thomas jumps in to save her, and the family follows him downstream.They then meet up with two female geese, Abigail and Amelia. The group then follow the two to their Uncle Waldo. Their journey takes them to a restaurant where Uncle Waldo has escaped from becoming the main course. However, being marinated in white wine has caused Uncle Waldo to be quite tipsy.Meanwhile, Edgar returns to the countryside and manages to get back his hat and umbrella, but not before Napoleon and Lafayette attempt to nip at his heels again.Back in Paris, the cats are almost home, but worn out from their trip. O'Malley then takes them to Scat Cat's abode in an abandoned building. Scat Cat and his gang of alley cats entertain the family, before heading off into the night.After the kittens are put to bed, Duchess and O'Malley share a tender moment. While Duchess tells of her eagerness to return to Madame, O'Malley (who has never really known kindness from humans), just thinks Madame sees Duchess and her kittens as housepets. Duchess however, explains that Madame sees them as more than this: they are the equivalent of a family to her.The next morning, O'Malley leads the family back to Madame's mansion. After saying his goodbyes, the cats head to the front door...only to be confronted by Edgar, who quickly throws them in a sack.Rocquefort has seen the whole thing, and after going to Duchess and the kittens in the sack, is told to find O'Malley. Rocquefort runs off and catches up to O'Malley. Thomas heads back to the mansion, and tells Rocquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang.Back in the mansion's stables, Edgar puts the cats into a trunk, telling them of his plans to send them to Timbuktu. He has already called for a truck to pick the trunk up, when O'Malley bursts in and attacks Edgar. Soon after, Scat Cat and his gang arrive to help, while Rocquefort manages to pick the lock and get the cats out. Scat Cat's gang, with some help from Frou-Frou, manage to knock Edgar into the trunk and out the stable's doors, just as the pick-up service arrives, taking it away.Some time afterward, Madame Bonfamille finds that Edgar has gone missing for some unknown reason, and calls on George to repurpose her will, removing him from any inheritance. Thomas is welcomed into the family, and Madam also has chosen to allow her mansion to be a safe haven for all the alley cats in Paris.The film ends with Scat Cat and his gang throwing a wild party at Madame's abode."
Little Big Man,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065988/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jack Crabb, looking back from extreme old age, tells of his life being raised by Native Americans and fighting with General Custer. Jack Crabb is 121 years old as the film begins. A collector of oral histories asks him about his past. He recounts being captured and raised by indians, becoming a gunslinger, marrying an indian, watching her killed by General George Armstrong Custer, and becoming a scout for him at Little Big Horn.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> 121-year-old Jack Crabb recounts his life, from being captured by the Cheyenne at age 10, to being raised by them, to living with white folks again and ultimately to being present at Custer's Last Stand at Little Bighorn, with many adventures, interesting characters, life stages and tragedies in between.—grantss In the present day 1970, 121-year-old Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman), the oldest living man in the world, who resides in a hospice, is recounting his long and colorful life story to a curious historian (William Hickey). Among other things, Crabb claims to have been a captive of the Cheyenne, a gunslinger, an associate of Wild Bill Hickok, a scout for General George Armstrong Custer, and the sole white survivor of Custer's force at the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn. Having been adopted by the Cheyenne and reared in their culture, Crabb tells the Historian that he has perspective on both Caucasian and Native American life in the 19th century.Flashing back to 1859, the 10-year-old Jack and his older sister Caroline (Carole Androsky) survive the massacre of their parents' wagon train by the hostile Pawnee warriors. Found by a Cheyenne warrior, Jack and his sister are taken back to a Cheyenne village. Caroline manages to escape on horseback, but Jack is reared by good-hearted tribal leader Old Lodge Skins (Chief Dan George). Life among the Cheyenne proves to be idyllic, though Jack unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear (Cal Bellini). However, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack, who saves him from a Pawnee warrior. Jack is given the name ""Little Big Man"" because he's short but very brave.In 1865, when Jack is age 16, he is captured by U.S. cavalry troopers after skirmish between them and the local Cheyenne. Jack then renounces his Native American upbringing in order to save himself from being killed. After his interrogation and debriefing, and being that he is still a minor, Jack is put in the care of Reverend Silas Pendrake (Thayer David) and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise (Faye Dunaway), who tries to seduce Jack. Jack cannot accept the contradiction between Louise's piety and sexual appetite. When Jack finds Louise one day seducing the owner of a local soda shop/pharmacy, he leaves the Pendrake household.A year or so later, Jack becomes the apprentice of the snake-oil salesman Merriweather (Martin Balsam). The two are tarred and feathered when their customers realize that Merriweather's products are fraudulent. One of the angry customers happens to be Jack's sister, Caroline. Once Caroline realizes that one of the men she helped to tar and feather was her brother, they reunite. She attempts to mold her brother into a gunslinger named the Soda Pop Kid (after his favorite beverage). Jack meets Wild Bill Hickok (Jeff Corey) at a saloon, and Hickok takes a liking to the young man. When Hickok is forced to kill a man in self-defense, Jack loses his taste for gun slinging and Caroline deserts him.Another year or two later, Jack becomes a partner in a general store and marries a Swedish woman named Olga (Kelly Jean Peters). Unfortunately, Jack's business partner turns out to be a thieving scoundrel and Jack is forced to close the store. The famous cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer (Richard Mulligan) happens upon the scene and suggests the couple re-start their lives further west.Jack and Olga set out, but their stagecoach is ambushed by Cheyenne hostiles. Olga is abducted and Jack sets out in search for her. During his quest, he is reunited with Old Lodge Skins, who is overjoyed Jack has returned to the tribe. Younger Bear has become a contrary (a warrior who does everything in reverse) and, having been humiliated by Jack years before, is still bitter. After a short stay with the tribe, Jack continues his search for Olga.He eventually becomes a ""muleskinner"" in Custer's 7th Cavalry, hoping to obtain information on Olga's whereabouts. He takes part in a battle against the Cheyenne, but when the 7th troopers begin killing unarmed women and children, Jack becomes enraged and turns on them. Nearby, Jack discovers a Cheyenne woman, Sunshine (Aimée Eccles), giving birth. He saves Sunshine from the marauding troopers and returns with her to Old Lodge Skins's tribe. Sunshine becomes his wife and, the following year, bears him a child of their own. Jack again encounters Younger Bear, who has undergone another life change. No longer a contrary, Younger Bear is now the henpecked husband of the long-lost Olga, who has become a Cheyenne squaw. Olga does not recognize Jack, who makes no attempt to remind her of their previous relationship. Sunshine asks Jack to take in her three widowed sisters as wives and to father children with them. He is reluctant at first, but finally agrees and has sex with all three in succession.One day during the winter season, Custer and the 7th Cavalry make a surprise attack on a Cheyenne camp in Oklahoma (to be known as the Battle of Washita River, which took place on November 27, 1868). A now-blind and elderly Old Lodge Skins is saved by Jack, but Sunshine and their child are killed along with her sisters. Jack tries to infiltrate Custer's camp to exact revenge. At a crucial moment, with knife in hand, Jack loses his nerve, and is mocked by Custer for it.Flashing forward eight years later in 1876, a disheartened Jack has become the town drunk in Deadwood, South Dakota. While in a drunken stupor, he is recognized by Wild Bill Hickok, who gives him money to clean up. When Jack returns to the bar, Hickok is shot and killed. With his last breath, Hickok expresses a dying wish involving a widow he was having an affair with. Jack goes to see the widow, a prostitute who turns out to be Louise Pendrake. Jack gives her the money that Hickok intended for her to use to start a new life.Jack soon becomes a trapper and hermit. His mind becomes unhinged after coming across an empty trap with a severed animal limb. Poised at the edge of a cliff, he prepares to commit suicide. Jack suddenly hears the faint chords of the traditional cavalry tune Garryowen echoing through a valley and spots Custer and his troops marching nearby. Jack decides to exact revenge. Custer, who remembers that Jack once tried to assassinate him, hires him him as a scout, believing anything he says will be a lie, thus serving as a reverse barometer.Jack leads the troops into a trap at the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. Before the attack, Jack truthfully tells Custer of the overwhelming force of Native Americans hidden within the valley of the Little Bighorn. The arrogant and overconfident Custer does not believe him and leads the 7th Cavalry to its doom. During the frantic battle, Custer begins to rave insanely while Jack is wounded. Ignoring the closing circle of massed Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, Custer points his pistol at Jack. Before he can pull the trigger, Custer is shot and killed by Younger Bear, who removes the unconscious, wounded Jack from the battle by carrying him to Old Lodge Skins' tepee pretending that he is carrying a fellow warrior. Having thus discharged his life debt, Younger Bear tells Jack that the next time they meet, he can kill Jack without becoming an evil person.Some days later at the Indian camp, the recovering Jack accompanies Old Lodge Skins to a nearby hill, the Indian Burial Ground, where the old man, dressed in full Chief's regalia, has declared ""It is a good day to die"", and decides to end his life with dignity. He offers his spirit to the Great Spirit, and lies down at his spot at the Indian Burial Ground to wait for death. Instead, it begins to rain. Old Lodge Skins is revealed to still be alive, and says, ""Sometimes the magic works, and sometimes it doesn't"". They return to his tepee to have dinner.Back in the present, Jack's narrative abruptly ends and he dismisses the Historian who leaves the room. The film concludes with an extended shot of the elderly Jack sitting in his wheelchair and sadly staring into space.... thinking about the memories of a world which is no more."
Ryan's Daughter,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066319/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set in the wake of the 1916 Easter Rising, a married woman in a small Irish village has an affair with a troubled British officer. World War I seems far away from Ireland's Dingle peninsula when Rosy Ryan Shaughnessy (Sarah Miles) goes horseback riding on the beach with the young English officer. There was a magnetic attraction between them the day he was the only customer in her father's pub and Rosy was tending bar for the first time since her marriage to the village schoolmaster. Then one stormy night some Irish revolutionaries expecting a shipment of guns arrive at Ryan's pub. Is it Rosy who betrays them to the British? Will Shaugnessy take Father Collin's advice? Is the pivotal role that of the village idiot who is mute?—Dale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com> The film takes place in the isolated village of Killary on the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland during World War I. The villagers are nationalist and exclusionary, taunting Michael (John Mills) (the mute village idiot) and British soldiers stationed at a nearby army base. They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village. In public, Ryan pretends to be a staunch nationalist; in an early scene, he strongly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, referring to the rebels as ""our boys"".Rosy is bored with her humdrum village life and fantasizes about the outside world much to the chagrin of the local priest, Father Hugh Collins (Trevor Howard), an old, sharp-witted and highly influential person who knows all that goes on in the village. Rosy is in love with the local schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum), a widower older than herself. She imagines that Shaughnessy will be able to add excitement to her life because he is educated and listens to classical music. He tries to convince her they are not a good match and suggests she leave the village and see the world. The two ultimately marry, but Rosy quickly becomes discontented with her marriage. She is looking for passion beyond just love in her relationship.Major Randolph Doryan (Christopher Jones) arrives to take command of the local army base. A veteran of World War I, he has been awarded a Victoria Cross, but has a crippled leg and suffers from shell shock. Rosy is instantly attracted to him. When Michael absent-mindedly bangs his foot on the pub bench, it causes Doryan to have a flashback to the trenches and collapse. When he recovers, he is comforted by Rosy. The two passionately kiss until they are interrupted by the arrival of Ryan and the townspeople. The two arrange to meet the next day horseriding and end up in the forest for a lengthy liaison.Charles becomes suspicious of Rosy, but keeps his thoughts to himself. While on a trip to the beach with his students, he finds Rosy and Doryan's footprints with the telltale dragging of his injured leg in the sand and tracks them to a cave; later he finds a conch shell in Rosy's dresser, but refuses to confront her about it. However, Michael has also seen the two lovers, and while parading in an improvised British officer's uniform, he tips off the townspeople about the affair. The townspeople turn on Rosy, deriding her as a ""British officer's whore"".One night, in the midst of a fierce storm, IRB leader Tim O'Leary (Barry Foster) who had killed a police constable earlier and a small band of comrades arrive in Ryan's pub and strong-arm Ryan into helping them recover a shipment of German arms from the beach. When they leave, Ryan tips off the British.Soon the entire town arrives at the beach to help. However, O'Leary and his followers are stopped by Major Doryan and his men on the road and arrested. O'Leary is shot and wounded by Doryan while attempting to escape.Charles tells Rosy that he is aware of her infidelity but hopes Rosy and Doryan will ""burn it out"". That night, Charles watches Rosy rise from bed to return to Doryan and Charles wanders off along the beach in his nightclothes until he is found the next day by Father Collins. Though Rosy declares the affair over, Charles decides to leave her. Then, however, a town mob arrives and accuses Rosy of having informed the British of the arms shipment and strip her and shear off her hair. Ryan, deeply ashamed, is unable to confess and save his daughter from the punishment which is due to him.Meanwhile, Doryan is wandering on the beach and comes across Michael. Michael leads him to a cache of arms including dynamite that was not recovered by the army. After Michael runs off, Doryan commits suicide by detonating the explosives.The next day, Rosy and Charles leave for Dublin, enduring the taunts of the villagers as they go. Ryan wishes his daughter well and acknowledges that Charles is a better man than he originally thought to wed his daughter, his princess. As Charles gets on the small bus, Father Collins advises him that his parting gift is the doubt that Charles and Rosy should end the marriage."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066473/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of the 1941 Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor, and the series of preceding American blunders that aggravated its effectiveness. This dramatic retelling of the Pearl Harbor attack details everything in the days that led up to that tragic moment in American history. As United States and Japanese relations strain over the U.S. embargo of raw materials, Air Staff Officer Minoru Genda (Tatsuya Mihashi) plans the preemptive strike against the United States. Although American intelligence agencies intercept Japanese communications hinting at the attack, they are unwilling to believe such a strike could ever occur on U.S. soil.—Jwelch5742 In 1941 the Japanese are at odds with the United States on a number of issues which they are attempting to resolve via their Washington embassy. In case this diplomacy fails, the military are hatching plans for a surprise early Sunday morning air attack on the U.S. base at Pearl Harbour. American intelligence is breaking the Japanese diplomatic messages but few high-ups are prepared to believe that an attack is likely, let alone where or how it might come.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The path to war in December 1941 is retold from the appointment of Isoroku Yamamoto to command the Imperial Japanese Navy on through the execution of his most ambitious and audacious plan - an attack by carrier aircraft on the US Navy station at Pearl Harbor, in Hawaii. As the Japanese First Air Fleet sorties to Hawaii, diplomatic efforts by both nations continue, but intercepts of Japanese diplomatic messages show Japan is practicing deception and planning aggression - but there is no clue as to where Japan will strike.—Michael Daly In the summer of 1941, the United States and Japan seem on the brink of war after constant embargos and failed diplomacy come to no end. ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", named after the code words use by the lead Japanese pilot to indicate they had surprised the Americans, covers the days leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which plunged America into the Second World War.—Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> Tokyo, 1941. As World War II rages in Europe, a change-of-command ceremony takes place aboard the Japanese battleship Nagato, the flagship for the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Soh Yamamura). He takes command from the departing Fleet Admiral Zengo Yoshida (Junya Usami). In Yoshida's cabin, the two of them discuss America's current trade embargo that starves Japan of raw materials including oil due to the war Japan has been waging in China since 1937.While both agree that a war with the United States would be a tragedy for Japan, a meeting between Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoye, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, and the hot-headed War Minister General Hideki Tojo (Asao Uchida) reaches a consensus that the time is now ripe to attack the US; Matsuoka believes the U.S. to be pre-occupied with the war in Europe and when Konoye warns that the US has an army in the Philippines and has moved its Pacific Fleet to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Matsuoka argues that it is all the more reason to prepare for war.The fear of war in Admiral Yamamoto increases when Militarist Japan signs the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in Berlin, making Japan the third member of the Axis Powers - Saburo Kurusu, at the time Japan's ambassador to Germany, is the direct signatory of the pact. Yamamoto orders the planning of a preemptive strike, believing Japan's only hope is to annihilate the American Pacific fleet at the outset of hostilities. Even then, Yamamoto warns that even if that was achieved at the start, he warns Japan would have the advantage for perhaps six months (A prediction that would prove ominously true when the Japanese Navy suffered a crippling defeat at Midway, almost six months to the day after the Pearl Harbor attack).When planning the attack, the Japanese commanders debate Pearl Harbor's exposure to a torpedo attack, but realize that torpedoes dropped from an aircraft will fall and submerge at least 75 feet (23 meters) below the surface. Since Pearl Harbor is only 40 feet (12 meters) deep, the Americans feel they have a natural defense against torpedoes. This belief is reflected in conversation while overflying the harbor between Admiral Husband Kimmel, the new Commander of the Pacific Fleet, and his predecessor Admiral James Richardson, bitter because he'd opposed moving the Fleet from San Diego.But the Japanese devise a plan to overcome this obstacle; they fit small wooden stabilizers to aerial torpedoes, making them effective in the shallow harbor; they also retrofit armor-piercing battleship shells, converting them to aerial bombs effective against the American ships.In a major intelligence victory, American intelligence in Washington, through the Navy Department, manages to break the Japanese Purple Code, allowing the United States to intercept radio transmissions the Japanese think are secret. American intelligence in Washington, in the persons of Navy Lt. Commander Alvin Kramer and Army G-2 Lt. Colonel Rufus Bratton (E.G. Marshall), is seen collecting increasingly threatening radio intercepts and conveying their concern to a White House staff that seems strangely unresponsive. The American response to high quality intelligence in general appears lax, although Pearl Harbor does increase air patrols and goes on full alert well before the raid.Japanese commanders call on the famous Air Staff Officer Genda Minoru (Tatsuya Mihashi) to mastermind the attack.At Pearl Harbor, although hampered by a late-arriving critical intelligence report about the attack fleet, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel (Martin Balsam) and General Walter C. Short (Jason Robards) do their best to enhance defenses. Short orders his aircraft to be concentrated in the middle of their airfields to prevent sabotage (leading to a pointed bit of dialogue between two officers when one objects to the order by saying, ""Suppose there's an air raid?"") To his credit, General Short also arranges more radar stations, a very new air defense technology for that time for that old soldier, and overcomes conflicting administrations like the Parks department to make that possible.In Japan, Yamamoto tries to avoid an attack and blames the Japanese Army for pushing too hard for war when peace is still an option. Yamamoto stresses that the United States is a mighty foe who would be extremely dangerous to provoke. In order to defeat the United States, he claims, destroying the U.S. fleet or even capturing Hawaii would not suffice Japan would have to invade the mainland and dictate terms of U.S. surrender on the White House steps, an eventuality Yamamoto clearly sees as impossible to achieve.In Washington D.C., diplomatic tensions increase between the U.S. and Japan as the Japanese ambassador to the United States is seen asking Tokyo for more information to aid in negotiations to avoid war, but getting little or nothing to work with in return. Tojo adamantly opposes any last minute attempts at peace, and by December 6 Japan commences a series of 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington that will conclude with the declaration of war. But the Americans are translating the radio messages faster than the Japanese embassy, whose own reception and processing of their own government's message is frustratingly slow. Hence, the Americans know some kind of attack is coming before the Japanese ambassador informs them.On the morning of Sunday, December 7, 1941 decision makers in Washington and Hawaii are seen enjoying a leisurely routine while American intelligence works feverishly to interpret the coded transmissions and learns the final message will be received precisely at 1:00 pm Washington time. Colonel Bratton notes that the final message instructs the Japanese Ambassador to destroy their code machines after they decode the last of the 14 messages as well as destroy all written documents at the embassy in preparation for imminent internment... an ominous point. Bratton's frantic attempts to convey this message to American commanders fail because they are enjoying a Sunday of playing golf and horseback riding.Bratton manages to contact Commander Kramer (Wesley Addy), about the last part of the 14th message. Kramer then relays it to Chief of Naval Operations Harold Rainsford Stark (Edward Andrews) who is informed of the increased threat, but decides not to inform Hawaii until after calling the President first... although it is not clear if he takes any action at all.Finally, at 11:30 a.m. Washington time, Bratton convinces the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall (Keith Andes), that a greater threat exists, and Marshall orders that Pearl Harbor (and all other Pacific installations) be notified of an impending attack.Meanwhile in Hawaii, an American destroyer, USS Ward, spots a Japanese two-man midget submarine trying to slip through the defensive net and enter Pearl Harbor. The destroyer attacks and sinks the submarine, and notifies the base. Although the receiving officer, Lieutenant Kaminsky (Neville Brand), takes the report of an attempted enemy incursion seriously, the pompous Captain John Earle (Richard Anderson) at Pearl Harbor demands confirmation before calling an alert. Admiral Kimmel later learns of this negligence and is furious he was not told of this enemy action immediately. Rather then call a high alert, he decides to call for an emergency meeting of his officers at headquarters at 8:00 am.Just after 7:00 am, two U.S. Army privates posted at the remote radar station, Joseph Lockard and George Elliot, spot the incoming Japanese aircraft and inform the Hickam Field Information Center, but the Army Air Forces Lieutenant in charge, Kermit Tyler, dismisses the report, thinking it is a group of American B-17 bombers coming from the mainland, and he is frankly too tired to care after a night of drinking.The Japanese intend to break off negotiations (they do not intend to issue a formal declaration of war) at 1:00 p.m. Washington time, 30 minutes before the attack. However, the typist for the Japanese ambassador is slow, and cannot decode the 14th part fast enough. So Ambassador Kichisaburo Nomura (Shôgo Shimada) decides to postpone his meeting with the Secretary of State.A final attempt to warn Pearl Harbor is stymied by poor atmospherics and bungling when the telegram sent by General Marshall is not marked urgent; it will be received by Pearl Harbor during the attack. The incoming Japanese fighter pilots are pleasantly surprised when there isn't even any anti-aircraft fire as they approach the base. As a result, the squadron attack leader Commander Mitsuo Fuchida (Takahiro Tamura) radios in the code phrase marking that complete surprise for the attack has been achieved: ""Tora, Tora, Tora.""Once the Japanese attack planes commence fire, the soldiers and sailors at Pearl and nearby bases respond and return fire, but with surprise achieved resistance against the Japanese planes is desperate and only partially effective. Upon seeing the Japanese low-level bombers, an American officer, Logan Ramsey, instructs his colleague to get the tail numbers so the pilot can be reported for safety violations; he thinks they are American aircraft. The sight of the offending aircraft then deliberately dropping a bomb on the base dispels that misconception. At that shock, Ramsey and his companion sprint to a telegraph officer to send what would be a famous telegram to raise the alarm; ""AIR RAID ON PEARL HARBOR THIS IS NO DRILL.""The aircraft security precautions by General Short prove a disastrous mistake that allows the Japanese aerial forces to destroy the U.S. aircraft on the ground with ease, thereby crippling an effective aerial counter-attack: all the aircraft on the runways at the major airfields are destroyed spectacularly either as they took off or while they were still parked.Amid the mayhem the force of B-17 bombers Lt. Tyler mistakenly believed was the earlier radar contact, a force commanded by Major Truman Landon, arrives at Oahu per schedule and is immediately attacked by both Japanese fighters and gunners from US ships mistaking them for enemy craft, forcing the bombers to scatter and try to make emergency landings. As if this crisis wasn't enough for Major Landon's unarmed and low-on-fuel bomber squadron, the Major's own plane's landing gear cannot deploy completely and he has to crash land at an airbase, although apparently with no injuries.Even in this debacle for the US Navy, there are still acts of American heroism such as Doris Miller, an African-American seaman who goes above and beyond the call of duty (especially considering he was not allowed to be trained in an on-board combat role due to the US Navy's racist policies) to take command of an unattended machine gun to help defend the base. There were also two American fighter pilots, Ken Taylor and George Welch, who race to remote Haleiwa and manage to take off to engage the enemy, as the Japanese have not hit the smaller airfields. Taylor and Welch engage several Japanese planes over Oahu and manage to shoot down several Japanese fighters and bombers while escaping scot free.The catastrophic damage wrought by the attacking Japanese air fleet is well detailed, with sailors fighting as long as they can and then abandoning sinking ships and jumping into the water with burning oil on the surface - the sight of the wreckage also enables Lieutenant Kaminsky to deliver comeuppance to the horrified Captain Earle when he arrives at the base and sees for himself the havoc wrought by the Japanese. Admiral Kimmel fares little better considering that when he is helplessly watching his base being ravaged, a spent bullet penetrates a window and hits him with little physical harm, but the shame of this debacle under his command and the knowledge that he will likely be unfairly blamed for it leaves him commenting that it have been merciful if it killed had him.The pivotal point of the attack comes amid a plethora of torpedo hits delivered to several US battleships - a Japanese bomber, sporting one of the converted armor-piercing shells, closes on its target - identified via a newspaper photo taped to the cockpit's side - the USS Arizona. The bomb lands on the ship's armored deck near one of the main turrets, smashes through, detonates forward magazines, and the malestrom of explosions erupts into one catastrophic blast whose shockwave rocks even the bomber. In addition to that loss, the sinking of the battleship sinks on the underwater pipes below that supply water for firefighters, impeding their effort to prevent fires from reaching the base's massive oil storage facilities and potentially causing catastrophic new fires and explosions that could destroy much of the entire base.At the end of the attacks, Fuchida and all surviving Japanese planes return to their carriers to insist a third wave be launched against Pearl Harbor in a late afternoon or evening strike. But the Japanese fleet commander, Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Eijiro Tono), refuses to launch the third wave of carrier aircraft out of fear of exposing his six carriers to increased risk of detection and destruction from the still-absent US carriers.(Through the years, this action has been debated as having given the Americans a major break in their efforts to recover from the attack. A third wave would have likely struck the large oil tanks as well as destroyed the dry docks and repair facilities, potentially serious blows which could have crippled the U.S. Pacific Fleet for months by themselves.)Despite strong protests by Fuchida as well as most of the naval officers on board the carrier flagship Akagi (including Genda) to mount another attack against Pearl Harbor, Nagumo overrules all of them and orders the Japanese fleet to sail for home.With the U.S. base in flames, its frustrated commanders, General Short and Admiral Kimmel, finally get the War Department's telegram warning them of impending danger. In Washington, the US Secretary Of State, Cordell Hull (George Macready), is stunned at learning of this brazen attack and urgently requests confirmation of it before receiving the Japanese ambassador who is waiting just outside his office. The distraught Japanese ambassador Nomura, helpless and at a loss of words to explain the late ultimatum and the unprovoked sneak attack, is bluntly rebuffed by Hull, who coldly replies to the final Japanese communique: ""In all my fifty years of public service, I have never seen a document crowded with falsehoods and deliberate distortions on a scale so huge that, until this day, I would have thought no nation on Earth capable of uttering them!"" Ambassador Nomura leaves Hull's office to return to the embassy where he and his staff will presumably be detained by the authorities.At Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, arrives several hours after the attack where Admiral Halsey (James Whitmore) observes the devastation of the harbor and orders his officers to have the ship refitted and to set out at nightfall.In the final scene, back in Japan, Admiral Yamamoto is seen lamenting the fact that the Americans did not receive the declaration of war until 50 minutes after the attack started, noting that nothing would infuriate the Americans more. He is quoted as saying: ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.""The closing credits roll over the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in flames."

He discovers a planet ruled by apes and an underground city run by telepathic humans. Brent is an American astronaut, part of a team sent to locate missing fellow American astronaut George Taylor. Following Taylor's known flight trajectory, the search-and-rescue team crash-lands on an unknown planet much like Earth in the year 3955, with Brent the only survivor of the team. What Brent initially does not know, much like Taylor didn't when he landed here before Brent, is that he has landed back on Earth in the future, in the vicinity of what was New York City. Brent finds evidence that Taylor has been on the planet. In Brent's search for Taylor, he finds that the planet is run by a barbaric race of English-speaking apes, whose mission is in part to annihilate the human race. Brent eventually locates some of those humans, who communicate telepathically and who live underground to prevent detection by the apes. These humans, who are in their own way as barbaric as the apes, want in turn to protect their species. Brent must figure out a way to save himself under the circumstances, which may be more difficult to accomplish in the battle between the dominant species on this planet.—Huggo Astronaut Brent is sent to rescue Taylor but crash lands on the Planet of the Apes, just like Taylor did in the original film.

Suddenly and without warning, walls of fire spring up from the ground and deep chasms open in the earth. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes.Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second human spaceship has crash-landed after being sent in search of Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled forward through time into Earth's distant future. Two astronauts emerge whom are John Brent (James Franciscus) and the gravely wounded captain of ship, known only as Skipper, who soon dies from his wounds. Brent reads the Earth year on his crashed ship as 3955 A.D., and he believes he has traveled to another planet, unaware that this is Earth of the far-future. He encounters Nova still riding on Taylor's horse and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags, but he cannot get her to speak.Hoping Taylor is still alive, Brent rides with Nova to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover a civilization of bipedal, talking apes. He observes the militarist gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to invade the Forbidden Zone, conquer it, exterminate all humans, and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan ruling leader Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) as well as the chimpanzee minority of Ape City. Brent is spotted and wounded by a gorilla soldier. He is taken by Nova to the home of Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their previous encounter with Taylor.

Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. Brent and Nova flee into the Forbidden Zone where they hide in a cave which Brent discovers to be the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, sparking the realization that he has traveled to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. Following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an intact nuclear bomb.Meanwhile back in Ape City, Dr. Zaius prepares to accompany General Ursus for the invasion by several armed gorilla battalions into the Forbidden Zone to exterminate any humans there. They are temporarily halted by a peace protest by the chimpanzee minority whom the gorillas proceed to detain. As Ursus and Zaius lead the huge ape army away from Ape City into the desert, Cornelius and Zira plot their own excursion into the Forbidden Zone desert to look for Taylor's spaceship by the Dead Lake deep in the zone where he told them in the previous movie where he crashed it.Back in the underground city, Brent and Nova are captured by the mutant humans and are telepathically interrogated. Brent reveals the apes are marching on the Forbidden Zone and will find their underground city. Above ground, the telepaths attempt to repel the ape army when it arrives by using their mental abilities to project illusions of fire and other horrors, as they had done to Taylor and Nova. Dr. Zaius sees through the illusions, however, and leads the ape army through to the ruined city. With the apes closing in, the telepaths plan to detonate their ""Divine Bomb"" as a last resort. They hold a religious ceremony, at the height of which they remove their masks to reveal that their appearance has been grotesquely mutated by centuries of exposure to nuclear fallout.Brent is separated from Nova and taken to a cell, where he finds Taylor imprisoned. The mutant Ongaro (Don Pedro Colley) uses his telepathic powers to force Brent and Taylor to fight each other to the death. Nova escapes her guard and runs to the cell, screaming her first word: ""Taylor!"" This breaks Ongaro's concentration, freeing Brent and Taylor from his control, and they overpower and kill him. Brent describes the bomb the mutants worship and Taylor recognizes it as a ""doomsday bomb"", capable of destroying all life on the surface of the planet.The heavily armed apes invade the subterranean city, killing Nova and making their way to the cathedral, shooting, stabbing, and clubbing all the mutant humans they see. They are confronted by Méndez (Paul Richards), the mutant leader who raises the bomb into activation position before being gunned down. Brent and Taylor attempt to stop Ursus from accidentally setting off the weapon, but Taylor is shot. Brent manages to take a rifle off a dead gorilla where he personally kills Ursus and several of his gorilla soldiers before being overwhelmed and shot dead by the other gorillas. The mortally wounded Taylor pleads with Dr. Zaius for help, but Zaius refuses, saying that man is only capable of destruction and that all humans must be exterminated. In his last moment, Taylor defiantly brings his hand down on the activation switch, triggering the bomb, which detonates... thus wiping out all life on the planet."

Chisum,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065547/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Cattle baron John Chisum joins forces with Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett to fight the Lincoln County land war. As one of the founders of the town of Lincoln, John Chisum is increasingly worried as Lawrence Murphy moves in on the local stores, bank and land by questionable means. Chisum and fellow honest ranch owner Henry Tunstall try and use the law, but Murphy owns that too. Confrontation threatens and Tunstall's man Billy Bonney is not slow to get involved.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} A series of paintings and a song in the opening credits show John Simpson Chisum (John Wayne) and his best friend James Pepper (Ben Johnson) taking their cattle and their ranch hands on a long cattle drive from Texas to the newly-settled land of New Mexico. After fighting the weather, Comanches, and other dangers, Chisum settles and builds a ranch and eventually owns a cattle empire the size of a small state. Lincoln County grows nearby, and Chisum often goes up on a large hill near his ranch to look out over the beautiful landscape, in a patriarchal vigil. The paintings fade into the film itself, showing an aging Chisum still sitting atop the hill.Pepper, also having aged, rides up to join him, and the two discuss how Chisum often sits up there, and how things have changed since they first arrived. Pepper remarks on how the government has penned up all the Indians on reservations and how new people are moving in and making the land more crowded. However, Chisum is philosophical, saying change eventually works out for the better, and the two ride down off the hill to meet the noon stage when it rolls into town. Pepper begins grumbling again, that they shouldn't have allowed Chisum's niece Sallie (Pamela McMyler) - who is the person they're intending to meet on the stage - to come to Lincoln County because a young woman in the house may be trouble. However, John tells him Sallie wrote and told him she was coming and he intends to welcome her despite Pepper's opinion on the matter.Further off across Chisum's vast territory, a group of banditos rides up from Old Mexico to meet Karl Riker (Gregg Palmer) and his friend Brady (Bruce Cabot). The drunken leader of the banditos, Neemo, (Lloyd Battista) suggests John Chisum has too much land, horses, and cattle, and when Brady pays him a fee, Neemo ominously says he will now collect a bonus from Mr. Chisum, before rejoining his men and riding off across the plain. Brady and Riker discuss that Chisum is not going to take kindly to banditos stealing some of his property, and ride away back to town before Chisum and Neemo can confront one another. Neemo and his men, meanwhile, find three of Chisum's men driving a herd of horses and descend upon them, killing two of them and riding off with the horses. Neemo shoots at the third, but he escapes and rides into town.In town, meanwhile, Pepper and Chisum are waiting for the stage, and notice that a businessman named Lawrence Murphy (Forrest Tucker) has set up businesses in town - a bank, an assay office, and many more. Chisum remarks that there's no law against a man owning businesses and as long as Murphy doesn't mess with them, they have no reason to be unfriendly to him. His mood instantly changes, however, when he sees a friend, Amos Patton (John Agar), and his family about to leave Lincoln County for good, and someone taking down the signs over Patton's store. Patton explains he lost the store and was driven out by the new owner, and somehow just doesn't feel like Lincoln County is the same anymore. He and his family leave for Arizona, and Chisum and Pepper see a new sign being put up over the store, indicated the person who forced Patton out is in fact Lawrence Murphy. Then, the ranch hand who escaped the banditos arrives in town and tells Chisum his friends are dead and the horses have been stolen. Pepper, Chisum, and the men with them ride off immediately in the direction the banditos went, to confront them and get the horses back.Out on the second-largest ranch in the area, British-born rancher and openly pacifist Henry Tunstall (Patrick Knowles) and three of his younger ranch hands are busy sorting cattle that have wandered over from Chisum's land into their herds, to return them to Chisum. One of the young men (Geoffrey Deuel) , addressed as William by Tunstall, points out a calf sired by a Tunstall bull but out of a Chisum cow, and asks if they can keep it. Tunstall tells him ""thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's property"" and they turn the calf loose with its mother, only to see the owner of the cows himself come riding over the plain towards them. Tunstall hails his friend, and Chisum explains they're off to confront the horse thieves. William asks if Chisum needs help but Chisum has already ridden past before he gets an answer. Tunstall doesn't believe in guns or violence, but allows William and his other two hands Charley (Ron Soble) and Tom (Chris Mitchum) to follow Chisum, going along himself to see what happens.Chisum finds Neemo and his gang watering the horses along a river and tells his men to stay behind and cover him. He and Pepper ride down and he openly challenges Neemo, telling him the horses are his. Neemo insists there is a mistake, but Chisum won't be fooled, and Neemo tells him he hasn't got enough men to deal with his gang. He offers to sell the horses back to Chisum but Chisum won't pay a second time for his own property. Neemo then draws a gun and Chisum shoots him dead. William rides down to join Chisum and Pepper and the three of them start firing upon Neemo's gang, who are firing upon them. The others cover from a distance with their long guns. William's aim is impressive for one so young, and after the remaining banditos flee at seeing their numbers depleted, Chisum comments on William's skill. Tunstall arrives on the scene and asks if everyone is all right. Pepper shows Chisum some American money he found on Neemo's body, suggesting he was paid to come up from Mexico. Chisum then tells Tunstall that when he brings his men to the reception party he has planned for his niece Sallie, to be sure to bring along William. Tunstall then reveals that William is, in fact, none other than Billy Bonney, also known as Billy the Kid, whom he has taken on as a ranch hand and is working to reform. Chisum is unhappy at this news, but says he isn't going to renege on the invitation. He and his men ride back into town to meet Sallie.Upon arriving in town, Chisum goes into a Saloon and encounters Murphy and his business partner James Dolan (Edward Faulkner) . Dolan is in the process of telling local rancher Juan Delgado (Alberto Morin), in no uncertain terms, that he no longer can water his herds along the land he always has before, as Murphy now owns it and is running too much cattle to share water rights. Murphy is more friendly than Dolan, but he apologetically backs Dolan up on this claim, and Chisum interjects himself into the conversation, telling Juan he can come onto the Chisum spread to water his herds. Murphy says Chisum is a generous man, and that they are now neighbors because he just acquired some land contiguous to his spread. He tries his best to be friendly to him, and even offers Chisum a drink, but Chisum refuses, leaving the saloon, telling Murphy he knows what he did to Amos Patton and that he has no intention of being friends with him. Walking out of the saloon, he encounters Riker and Brady, but Brady now has his sheriff's badge on and tells Chisum he was just appointed the new sheriff. Chisum, knowing Brady is a former criminal, suspects Murphy of being behind it.The stagecoach finally arrives - four hours late - and Chisum and Pepper go out to meet it. A young married couple, Alex and Sue McSween, (Andrew Prine and Lynda Day George), however, is all that can be seen. However, Alex reveals Sallie was on the stage and told them to be on the lookout for her Uncle and to tell him she had gone into the stables nearby. Sallie herself then comes running out of the stables and asks for money to pay for a horse, which she will settle up once she unpacks. Pepper obliges and Sallie buys her new horse, and Sallie tells Chisum she's invited the McSween family to the reception Chisum announced for her. Chisum offers to let Sue and Alex stay at his ranch until they get settled, but Alex says they have rooms in town and that he was asked to come from Kansas City by Lawrence Murphy, who knows Alex has legal experience and wants him as his personal lawyer. Alex clearly has no idea what he's getting into, and Chisum decides not to tell him just yet, taking Sallie back to the ranch and telling the McSween's they'll see them at the reception on Friday.Over the next week, Sallie settles in to the ranch, and says she loves it there much more than staying with her Aunt in Baltimore. She and Chisum discuss how he built his empire, and how he never married, and how he is blood brothers with an Indian who was once his enemy but now is penned up on the reservation. He shows Sallie his watch, which has her mother and Chisum's brother in their wedding clothes as the picture within.Meanwhile, Tunstall buys Billy a new suit of clothes in town, and tells him his good behavior has earned him a bonus in pay. One of Billy's old friends, Jess Evans (Richard Jaeckel), rides into town with his gang. Billy makes it clear immediately he has no wish to have anything to do with Evans and that he has gone straight, which dismays Evans and impresses Tunstall. Evans is met by Riker, who takes him aside to tell him of a plan they have hatched with Murphy.The night of the reception comes, and most of the town and surrounding ranchers, with Murphy and his men conspicuously absent, arrives to celebrate. There is food, dancing, music, and a good time to be had by all, but Chisum sees Billy and Sallie dancing and instantly becomes very alarmed. Alex McSween falls into conversation with Chisum, telling him he'd never met Murphy before the former happened to pass through Kansas City, where he lived, and offered him a high-paying job. He doesn't yet know exactly what sort of legal affairs Murphy wants him to handle and doesn't appear to be in on any of the plotting.Some distance from the party, some of Chisum's men are driving a herd of beeves to the Indian Reservation, where the Army will distribute them to the Comanche tribe there. A stranger (Glenn Corbett), walking without his horse and carrying a saddle, hails the camp and asks if he can come in to get some coffee. The ranch hands are suspicious but allow him to join them, and he tells them his name is Pat Garrett and he's a former Buffalo Hunter. He also tells them he came into the camp to warn them that they have several riders sneaking alongside their herd of cattle in the dark, and that they could be in trouble. Garrett offers to help them deal with the situation, and they give him a horse and go to confront the mysterious riders. The riders turn out to be Riker, Evans, and some of Evans' gang, and when they see they've been spotted, they start firing their guns and cause the herd to stampede and scatter. Garret and the ranch hands fire upon the bandits, and one Ranch hand is killed. Garrett plugs Riker when the latter gets too close, but the bullet only grazes his ribs. They drag Riker back to the Chisum ranch to tell Chisum what happened.Chisum, Tunstall, and McSween meet the men in the Kitchens so as not to disturb the party going on. Chisum tells the men to gather as much of the scattered cattle as they can and that they'll explain the situation to the Army in the morning. He also tells McSween that Riker will likely be his first ""legal affair"" but doesn't elaborate further. He asks Pat Garrett if he'd like a job but Garrett says he wants to try his hand at gambling before settling down. Chisum still wants to reward him for helping, and tells him he can have his pick of a horse. He also offers him a drink, and introduces Pat to Sallie when they go outside to get the whiskey. He also has to introduce Pat to Billy, but mercifully the two are civil to one another, despite Pat having heard of Billy's less than stellar reputation.The next morning, Chisum dumps Riker off at the jail and overrides Brady's intention to handle the little rustling matter himself, sending a telegram to a Judge to come in and try Riker for murder since one of Chisum's men is dead. Alex, meanwhile, goes for his first meeting with Murphy. Murphy then reveals to Alex that he sees the Map of Lincoln county as a chessboard, and that he is willing to do anything necessary to get Chisum's land because it is smack in the middle of the territory he wants to control. Brady and Evans both come in and Lawrence assures them that Alex is one of the family. Brady is upset that Riker has been arrested and that a Judge is coming. Murphy dismisses Alex and tells Brady to let Riker escape, and print up some wanted posters. Riker will hide out of town until the Judge gets tired of waiting. Evans asks why he can't just assassinate Chisum but Murphy says that Evans would likely get killed himself before he got the chance, and to leave the planning to him.Dolan and Delgado start fighting again, and Billy intervenes by shooting out a lantern on the store steps. Delgado says the store, being the only one in town now, has more than doubled the prices and no one who is a smallholder like him can afford it. Murphy offers to mortgage Delgado's spread, and Tunstall and Chisum arrive on the scene, indicating that they intend to start their own store and bank in the spirit of healthy competition, to keep the prices down. This upsets Murphy and Dolan. Evans tells Billy his aim is still good but Billy still refuses to be friendly to him.Chisum and his men deliver a few of the beeves to the army and tell the captain there that the rest will be delivered later. However, the Army captain says that he is no longer interested in buying cattle from Chisum and that he has arranged to get cattle from another, cheaper, more reliable source. They tell the Indians who have come out to meet Chisum to go back to the reservation. The chieftain, White Buffalo (Abraham Sofaer) refuses, instead going over to tell Chisum he has no intention of letting this matter sour their friendship. A sergeant tries to drag White Buffalo back, but Chisum tells him that if he touches White Buffalo he'll kill him. Thus warned, the Sergeant lets White Buffalo go about his business undisturbed and Chisum rides away. Murphy then comes out of the Army office and reveals he is the newer, cheaper source of meat for the Army, intimating Chisum charges too much and that the Army has made the right decision.Pepper later takes Sallie for a ride over the ranch, having warmed up to her presence there. He shows her some of the herds, and the oldest bull they have, who is still living even after having brought the original herd up from Texas. They hear gunshots and find Billy is having a little target practice with a cactus, as well as practicing his reading out of a Bible that Henry Tunstall let him borrow. He greets Pepper and Sallie and the two ride on, Sallie smiling at him and telling him to keep practicing.Back at the ranch house, McSween has abandoned Murphy and has told Tunstall and Chisum everything. He says he can't go along with a crooked businessman like that and that he and Sue are leaving Lincoln to go back to Kansas. Chisum says McSween should stay, as he knows about running stores and legal business and they need someone to run the new store and bank they're opening in town. After being reassured Tunstall and Chisum have no intention of doing anything crooked in their business, McSween gladly offers to become their junior partner in the venture. A building is secured in the town to be the joint bank and store, with the McSween family living in an apartment in the upper story. Chisum and Tunstall gather up a large group of their men and send them to Santa Fe to pick up the merchandise for the store. Billy is among those riding along, and Pat Garrett also agrees to come work for Mr. Chisum, having discovered he's no good at Gambling and needing a job. Billy carves a cross out of wood for Sallie and gives it to her before the wagon train sets off for Santa Fe. Evans, Dolan, and Murphy watch from their store window, and Murphy says to Evans it's a long way to Santa Fe and back, which means they have time to plot something.
Sallie, back at the ranch, indicates to Pepper and Chisum she's falling for Billy, much to their dismay. Pepper asks Chisum what they're going to do, but Chisum says they can't stop her.Meanwhile, in town, Brady is shocked to see a bounty hunter, Dan Nodeen (Chris George), come riding into town with a very dead Riker on the back of his horse. Nodeen is known for his vicious temper and his willingness to do anything to collect rewards. He also has a vendetta with Billy the Kid, though he doesn't know Billy is in town yet. Murphy, thinking this could be to his advantage, tries to get Nodeen to come work for him, but Nodeen is only interested in killing and collecting money and turns him down.The wagon train begins returning from Santa Fe. Billy and Pat have now struck up a friendship, jokingly calling each other ""Big Casino"" and ""Little Casino"" as neither really is any good at gambling, and converse about how Billy once ran with the worst of them but is doing his best to turn over a new leaf. Pat warns him that he still has a ""smell of death"" about him, and that he will have to work hard to get rid of it, but he believes he can do it with time and with patience. Billy is encouraged by this, and they come to a large river which they have to cross to get back into Lincoln. They are halfway across with the wagon train when an army of rustlers about fifty strong comes galloping up, wearing masks to hide their identity. One is revealed to be Evans as he adjusts his mask, and they start pouring bullets into the wagon train. However, Chisum and Tunstall expected this and two of the wagon covers are torn off to reveal that they do not carry supplies, but extra men with rifles ready to fire at the first sign of trouble. The battle rages and some of the supplies are lost in the river, but Evans and his men are driven off. However, Evans fires a parting shot at Billy, who he is angry at for going straight, and it knocks Billy off a wagon and into the water. Garrett immediately abandons the fight and goes to rescue him. Billy is taken back to Chisum's ranch, where the doctor reveals that the bullet broke a rib but didn't do any permanent damage, and that Billy needs two weeks of rest. Sallie offers to nurse him back to health, and Chisum and Pepper set out with their guns to take revenge on Murphy, knowing he is the only one with interest in ambushing the wagon train. Tunstall stops them, begging them to wait and not cause more bloodshed as too many lives have been lost. He indicates he's riding out the next day to put pressure on the Governor of New Mexico to get involved in the land war. Chisum doesn't think this will work, but agrees to let Henry try his way first before they come to a head to head battle. Pepper wanted to take out his revenge on Murphy, too, but reluctantly goes along.In town, the new store is a huge success, and Dolan is enraged by this, telling Murphy that he'd better do something because his store is failing miserably. Murphy reassures him something will be done, but Dolan is less than convinced, because he has had no customers for days. He and Evans set off with two of Brady's deputies, Morton (Robert Donner) and Baker (John Mitchum), to carry out their new scheme.Sallie continues to nurse Billy back to health, and Tunstall warns Billy not to get into trouble while he is gone visiting the governor. Billy promises he won't, and Tunstall leaves him the Bible to continue to practice his reading. He then goes out to his wagon to ride off to Santa Fe. Chisum says that he's worried about Sally and Billy, but Tunstall says Billy reminds him of a young man who killed another man in a brawl in England, and was hanged for it, and Tunstall always was sad that he could not help that young man. He has determined not to let the same thing happened to Billy and Chisum agrees to let Tunstall go on. After Tunstall has left, however, Pepper tells Chisum that things have already escalated past diplomacy and all that's going to clear the air is a confrontation between him and Murphy to settle once and for all who is in charge of this territory, possibly even a fight to the death. Chisum doesn't agree or disagree, but walks away to think it over.Meanwhile, Evans has put some ""T"" brands on a few of Murphy's cows, to make it look like Tunstall is rustling Murphy's cattle. Brady tells Morton and Baker to bring Tunstall in and hold him in jail until after Murphy himself is the first to get to the governor and tell his side of events. The two deputies ride off and intercept Tunstall, who is on the way to Roswell to catch the stagecoach to Santa Fe. They tell him he's wanted for rustling and is going back to Santa Fe with them. Tunstall reaches in his pocket to get his tobacco pouch and Morton believes he's going for a gun. He shoots him dead on the spot. Instantly, when they see it was the tobacco pouch and that Tunstall had no gun on him, the two deputies realize that they will be tried for murder and drop an extra gun next to the body to make it look like Tunstall pulled a gun on them. They ride back into town and make their report, and then flee to Valverde before the Judge earlier sent for by Chisum comes.Judge Wilson (Ray Teal) rides into town, just in time to see Tunstall's funeral taking place. Chisum, grieved at the loss of his friend, immediately marches off after the funeral is over to confront Brady. McSween and Wilson follow to make sure he does nothing rash. Sallie tries to comfort Billy, who is heartbroken and angered at Tunstall's death, but Billy refuses to leave the graveside. After everybody has left, he makes a promise over Tunstall's grave to ""put out the candle of the wicked"". Meanwhile, Evans and Murphy are in Santa Fe, and they tell their side of the story to the Governor, who believes them.Brady is forced to admit his men have left town and that he has no intention of arresting his own men. Wilson empowers Chisum and his men to bring in Morton and Baker ""dead or alive"". Wilson explains to McSween that he has done this so if Chisum decides to enact revenge without a trial it will be legal. Chisum, Pat, Charley, Tom, and several other men from his and Tunstall's ranches ride off to Valverde, find the two deputies, bind them and force them to ride back to Lincoln. Chisum tells them that he wants to shoot them, but has decided, since it was Tunstall they murdered and Tunstall would want justice served properly, that he is taking them into town and making sure they hang for the murder. Billy watches them coming back across the plain from a hidden place in the rocks. Chisum and several others ride off to Chisum's ranch to pick up Judge Wilson, leaving the deputies with Pat, Charley, and Tom. Billy seizes his chance and rides down to join them, talking with Pat in a friendly way. However, when Pat says Billy needs to get home and rest, Billy hits him over the head and proceeds to shoot Morton and Baker dead. Charley and Tom can only watch as he rides away.In town, Pat, Charley, and Tom bring the bodies in. Brady, Chisum, Wilson, and indeed half the town are waiting to see what will happen when the deputies are brought in and are shocked to see them dead. Garrett tells them that Billy was the one that did it and Brady instantly goes to organize a posse to bring Billy in. However, Billy comes riding down the street at a gallop, shoots Sheriff Brady and rides out of the other end of town before anyone can stop him.A telegram is sent to Murphy in Santa Fe by one of his men, and Murphy tells the Governor that Chisum and Wilson encouraged Billy to do this and that they should be punished. The Governor has no way to punish Chisum, but revokes Justice Wilson's powers so he cannot help Chisum in any way. Murphy rides back into town and gets Dan Nodeen to agree to be the new Sheriff, since Nodeen wants to kill Bonney and this has given him an opportunity to do so. The governor has also put out a 200 dollar reward for Billy and Murphy himself has added a thousand dollars, so the bounty is 1,200 dollars. Nodeen, Evans, and the Posse they organized ride out of town to hunt down Billy, who has gone into hiding. McSween has sent a letter to President Hayes himself, hoping the government will get involved before the land war goes any farther. Pat Garrett warns McSween that by the time the government gets around to investigating, Murphy might own the entire state. Wilson confronts Murphy with this, and Murphy counters by saying that Chisum put his name on whatever he could when he came into New Mexico, and he's been there a long time. Murphy has only been there a short while and claims he's just getting started. Chisum tells him that he hasn't just gotten started and has already drawn the line. He also warns Murphy that if anyone kills any more of his men, damages any of his property (including the store in town), or steals any more of his animals, he will not wait for the law but will come see Murphy personally.That night, Billy comes in secret to see Sallie, who tells him she does not agree with all he's done. Pat comes out with a gun, and Billy accuses him of wanting the reward. This horrifies Sallie, since she knows Garrett isn't like that. Chisum comes outside, and tells Billy that all he's doing is going to get himself killed, and maybe other people, and hurt Sallie and several others. Chisum also tells Billy he was once in love with Sallie's mother, but rode away when he found out Sallie's mother would be happier with his less wild brother. Billy takes the hint - Chisum wants him to let Pat court Sallie instead of him. Chisum tells Billy he won't turn him in for Nodeen to kill, but warns him he is never to set foot on the Chisum spread again. Billy rides away. Sallie, having overheard the conversation, tells Chisum not to worry and that she'll make the right choice.Nodeen rides all over trying to find Billy, with no success. He returns in town to rest the horses before they set off in the morning to search again. He refuses Murphy's offer of hospitality, going back to his room to drink alone. Evans and the rest tell Murphy that Nodeen is meaner than they expected and harsher as well, but Murphy insists that's what they need. Billy, meanwhile, has gone into hiding and watches Nodeen hunt him, from afar. Charley and Tom, wanting revenge for their employers' murder as well, have decided to join him. They plot to contact the rest of Tunstall's men and secretly hit Murphy's bank that night, blowing the safe and stealing all his cash and reserves to render him helpless. They lack dynamite, however, but Billy assures them he knows where they can steal some.Later that evening, Garrett tries to comfort Sallie, who is sad about Billy. She asks if Billy really wants the same thing as Chisum, and Garrett says Chisum wants Justice but Billy wants revenge, and there's a difference. He also says that there's a difference between love and infatuation, and Sallie realizes he does indeed have feelings for her - something Chisum and Billy were already well aware of.In town, Billy and his small band have managed to sneak into McSween's store and try to steal some dynamite. However, Alex hears them and comes downstairs. Billy explains they just need the loan of a little dynamite but McSween refuses, telling them he wrote to the president and that Billy needs to be patient. Billy insists he's made a promise and that he won't be swayed. Outside, Nodeen sees Billy's silhouette on the window, and goes to get Murphy, Dolan, and Evans. Sue comes downstairs and tells Billy that he shouldn't be here at this hour. Before the McSweens can argue further, however, shots ring out. Nodeen and his posse are firing upon the store from behind some boxes and crates. Billy's men all hide inside the store, and Nodeen tells Billy not to make any moves. Billy asks the McSweens be allowed to leave unharmed since they have no part in this. Nodeen says no one is allowed to come out until morning and that he'll kill anyone who comes out while it's still dark.Both sides then cease fire and wait until dawn, but when Nodeen makes his demands, Billy refuses to come out. The gunshots ring out between the two parties, and McSween begs to speak to Murphy. Murphy calls out to him, and Alex tells Murphy that he and his wife wish to come out. Nodeen doesn't want to allow this but Murphy says he doesn't want any women killed. Sue McSween is allowed to come out, but Nodeen grabs her and forces her behind the barricade his men have put up, and they begin firing upon the store again. Alex tries to negotiate a surrender but Billy stops him, refusing to cooperate. Sue, meanwhile, escapes on one of Murphy's horses and rides out to Chisum's ranch. Murphy orders a second barricade be built across the street to stop Chisum and his men from riding in. Delgado overhears this and rides out after Sue to warn Chisum.At the Chisum ranch, Garrett sees Sue riding in and alerts Chisum. Chisum and his men greet her, and she hysterically sobs out that Murphy has attacked the store and that Billy's in there. Chisum, keeping his promise that he'd act if Murphy tried anything, rouses the whole ranch and forms an army of his own, with himself, Pepper, and Garrett in the lead. They ride out towards town, armed and ready for battle.In town, Alex sees some of Billy's men fall, realizes they're outnumbered and will all be slaughtered. He begs to be allowed to talk to Nodeen and says he'll come out unarmed and alone. Nodeen says no one is allowed to leave alive unless they all come out at once with Bonney in the lead and all weapons left behind. The gunfire continues, and Alex foolishly goes out to try to negotiate with Murphy and Nodeen. Nodeen, not caring that Alex is unarmed, shoots him dead in the middle of the street. Billy, who had begged McSween not to go, is furious and redoubles his attack on Murphy's men. Nodeen orders torches be thrown at the store to smoke out Billy and his men and the store is promptly set ablaze.Delgado intercepts Chisum and tells him of the barricade. Chisum and his men are unfazed, and continue riding into town, simply scaring up a herd of cattle belonging to Murphy to drive them in a stampede ahead of them. The scheme works - the cattle crash through the barricade and Murphy and Evans' men scatter to get out of the way of the thundering hooves and horns. Billy, Charley, and Tom - all that is left alive of their party - manage to escape the burning store and get into the street. Garrett and Pepper meet up with them, and they continue firing upon any Murphy man they see. Billy runs a gauntlet of bullets to ensure he personally gets to and kills Evans, who was trying to escape town. Meanwhile, Chisum sees Murphy hiding in his own bank, and charges in, and the two instantly engage in a fight. Both men, while aging, are big and powerful, and the brawl continues all over the bank, first downstairs and then upstairs. They fight with fists, chairs, and anything else that comes to hand to hit each other with, eventually bursting through a window onto the balcony. Murphy grabs a mounted pair of longhorn steer horns off the wall and strikes at Chisum with it. Chisum knocks it away to the ground, and the two continue to struggle until they fall off the balcony. Chisum is winded and bruised, but able to get up when Pepper comes to help him. However, the fighting around them comes to an abrupt halt when everyone realizes Murphy is dead, having fallen on and impaled himself on the steer horns.Nodeen instantly tears off his badge and mounts his horse, throwing the badge at Dolan and telling him he resigns as sheriff since Murphy can't pay him the bounty on Billy anymore. He rides away and Billy gets a horse and prepares to pursue him. Garrett tries to get him to think better of it, but Billy announces that he intends to go back to being an outlaw and the ""smell of death"" they once talked about, and rides out of town in pursuit of Nodeen.Some months later, the President appoints a new governor and the Lincoln County Land War is officially declared over. Pat Garrett is elected the new sheriff and marries Sallie Chisum, who expresses that she hopes all the violence is finally coming to an end. Pepper says that there will always be violence because ""There's no law west of dodge and no God west of the Pecos"", but Chisum tells him this old saying is incorrect, because ""no matter where men go, sooner or later there's the law, and sooner or later they'll find that God's already been there."" He then rides away, and Sallie wonders where he's going. Pepper assures her he'll be back, and while she and Garrett tend to the dirty dishes, he goes outside. As Pepper suspected, Chisum has once again resumed his patriarchal vigil on the hilltop, sitting under the tree and thinking of all that has happened."
Two Mules for Sister Sara,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065134/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a former Civil War soldier saves a nun from a gang of bandits, they team up to help the Mexicans in their war against the French.

When the protégé of Colonel Cord McNally is killed during one of their raids, he tracks them down, but is captured. The leader, Captain Pierre Cordona wants the Colonel to lead them away, but instead leads them into their territory and captures Cordona and his Sergeant, Tuscarora. He knows that the only way they could get away with their raids is if they had inside information, which someone from the Union Army gave them. They refuse to tell McNally anything, and are imprisoned. When the War ends, McNally visits them and asks them to tell him from whom they got their information, but unfortunately, they don't know who they are. Tuscarora is on his way to Rio Lobo, Texas where he grew up. McNally then tells them that if they should ever come across them again, to contact him through a friend of his who is a Sheriff in Texas. Later, McNally is contacted by the Sheriff on instructions from Cardona, but when he arrives, Cardona is indisposed, so while they are waiting, a woman arrives and wants to report to the Sheriff a murder that took place in Rio Lobo, but the Sheriff claims that there's nothing he can do.

Union Colonel Cord McNally (John Wayne) leads some of his men to pursue them and as the confederates keep splitting up McNally splits his own troops in pursuit. As he ends up on his own in the forest he spots Cordona but as he attempts to capture him, he is jumped and knocked out by Sergeant Tuscarora Philips (Christopher Mitchum). They take him hostage and have him lead them as they try to escape through Union territory but as they approach a Union camp, McNally shouts out and escapes. Most of the confederates escape but McNally manages to pull Cordona from his horse and knock him out. Tuscarora hides under the water and when the Union soldiers ride past him, he goes back to help Cordona but McNally captures him as well. McNally wants information from them as it's the fourth time Union gold has been stolen by the Confederates and he knows they're getting information from someone. McNally offers to let them escape but Cordona and Tuscarora refuse to give him answers and are placed in a prisoner of war camp.
After the civil war ends, as Cordona and Tuscarora are being released, McNally is waiting to greet them and invites them for a drink. He doesn't hold them responsible for the acts they committed, he considers it part of war but he wants the traitor who was giving them information about the gold shipments. One of McNally's officers and friends, Lt. Forsythe was injured during the robbery and died. They tell McNally that it was two men, but it was dark and one was a big man with dark hair and the other was smaller with white hair but they don't know their names. Tuscarora tells McNally that he's going to Rio Lobo to work for the old man, Phillips, (Jack Elam) who brought him up. McNally tells them he can be reached through the Sheriff in Blackthorne, Texas if they ever have any more information for him about two traitors.Some time later, McNally gets a message from Cordona to meet him. The Blackthorne sheriff, Pat Cronin (Bill Williams) tells him Cordona is in the hotel waiting for him. As they are talking, a stagecoach pulls up in the town transporting a woman called Shasta Delaney (Jennifer O' Neill). She tells Pat that there's been a murder in Rio Lobo that was committed by one of the town's sheriff's deputies. Pat insists he can't do anything about it as it's out of his jurisdiction. McNally and Pat go to the hotel to meet Cordona but he's left a message not to be disturbed and they go and sit near Shasta in the bar having a drink. Four deputies arrive from Rio Lobo, including a white haired man called Whitey Carter. They walk into the hotel to arrest Shasta and return her to Rio Lobo. She denies his story and tells Pat that Whitey is the man who killed her friend. Whitey says it was self defense. Pat tells him he's not arresting anyone in his town without a warrant. One of the deputies sneaks in through the back door with a rifle pointing at him. Shasta pulls out a derringer from her bag underneath the table and shoots Whitey. McNally and Pat shoot the other two deputies and the last deputy is just about to shoot McNally when Cordona emerges from his room upstairs with a rifle and saves his life. Cordona recognizes Whitey as one of the men from the war who sold them information. Shasta starts to feel faint after killing Whitey and McNally takes her to Cordona's room to put her to bed. He talks to the stagecoach driver who confirms her story about Whitey killing her friend and her been innocent of murder. Cordona tells McNally that Whitey was working for a rich Yankee but that's all he and Tuscarora have found out. He also tells him that Tuscarora's old friend Phillips is having trouble in Rio Lobo from people who want to take his land away. He's hoping McNally will help him out in return for them helping him and he agrees. Shasta wakes up and offers to go with them as she knows Rio Lobo and knows who to talk to about everything that's going on.
The three of them arrive and sneak into the town late at night. They go to see Tuscarora's girlfriend, Maria (Susana Dosamantes). Maria tells them they can stay with her but they'll have to hide their horses out of view of Sheriff Tom Hendricks (Mike Henry) and his men. Cordona hides them but he notices some deputies patrolling the streets. With nowhere to hide he barges into the home of a woman called Amelita, who is topless at the time. They introduce themselves, she dresses and checks outside and when it's all clear he runs back to Maria's. Cordona thinks they should go to Tuscarora's in the morning but McNally doesn't think they should. If the sheriff and his men are watching the town, he reckons they'll be watching the ranch. Shasta suggests going into town faking a bad tooth to talk to the dentist who is a friend of Tuscarora's and find out what's going on so that Hendricks doesn't get suspicious about a stranger arriving.
Tuscarora arrives in town with a herd of horses he leaves at the stable and goes to the hotel where Maria works to greet her. McNally arrives and keeps his head down to avoid being noticed and witnesses Hendrick's deputies beat Tuscarora up after accusing him of stealing the horses. Maria tries to intervene but she is knocked down. Hendricks comes walking out and tells them to put Tuscarora in jail. Maria is crying and McNally approaches her as a stranger to avoid suspicion and tells her to go inside. He tells Hendricks he's just in town to the see Doc Jones (David Huddleston) about his tooth. Knowing that Hendricks and his men will be watching them through the window of his surgery Doc Jones pretends to remove McNally's tooth while giving him information about what's going on. He tells him that a man called Ketcham (Victor French) is running the town after arriving when the war ended. Hendricks had killed the old sheriff and been given the job by Ketcham. He tells McNally that they will probably use Tuscarora to blackmail Phillips and run off all his stock so that he's trapped inside and threaten to hang Tuscarora unless he sells his land for a quarter of what it's worth.
McNally tells Cordona and Shasta the situation and they go out to Phillips' ranch to try and help him. They knock out the three deputies who are trying to keep him prisoner in his home but are unable to approach the door through fear of been shot by the old man. Shasta goes to see him and he pulls her inside and tells McNally and Cordona to enter with their hands in the air. They explain they are friends of Tuscarora's and are trying to help him get out of jail. Phillips knows Ketcham's ranch well so McNally suggests they go and capture him and use him to bargain with Hendricks to release Tuscarora. They leave Shasta with a friend of Phillips' and go out to sneak into Ketchanm's ranch at night. They quietly take care of his men who are patrolling his home. McNally and Cordona look through the window and Cordona recognizes Ketcham as the traitor who sold them information during the war. It's a Sergeant Major who McNally knew. McNally breaks through the door and gives Ketcham a beating while Cordona and Phillips fire bullets at his men outside to keep them from getting in. McNally beats Ketcham until he agrees to sign over all the deeds he has from all the years of stealing. He agrees after an oil lamp is knocked over and his legs catch fire. They use him as hostage to get away on horseback. McNally realizes that that if they trade Ketcham for Tuscarora Hendricks and his men will just pursue them, capture them and kill them. So instead of trading him, McNally thinks they should order Hendricks and his men to leave the jail so they can join Tuscarora and hold out while Cordona goes to get the cavalry. A deputy arrives at the jail to tell Hendricks what has happened at Phillips' ranch. Hendricks tells his men to guard the main road and prevent anyone from going in or coming out.
McNally goes to Maria's. She's happy that they have Ketcham but Amelita has been attacked by Hendricks. She shows McNally the scar she has down the side of her face from him slicing her in order to get her to tell what she knows. She says she's going to kill him but McNally says he'll do it first. He and Phillips take Ketcham to the jail and tell Hendricks that they'll kill him unless he and his men unarm themselves and leave the office. They lock themselves away in the office and get Tuscarora out of the cell. They sit back and wait for the cavalry but the plan goes wrong when Cordona is ambushed and taken hostage by the deputies guarding the road before he can bring backup.
Doc Jones takes some food to McNally and the others at the office. A deputy delivers a message telling them they have Cordona and they want to trade him for Ketcham. With no other option, McNally agrees to it. He gives Doc Jones the deeds that Ketcham has signed and tells him that no matter what happens the people will get their land back.
The next morning, McNally, Phillips and Tuscarora take Ketcham to do the given exchange point. They meet Doc Jones at a cantina with some of the townspeople who are offering to help them. If Hendricks wins this battle they know they will have their land taken away again. Some of the them hide around the town armed while Tuscarora hides in the water that lays between the cantina and the barn where Hendricks and his men are holding Cordona. McNally shouts for Hendricks to release in return for Ketcham. Ketcham and Cordona start walking towards each other and Tuscarora signals to Cordona from the creek and Cordona jumps into the water. McNally orders Ketcham to stop going any further or he'll shoot him. Hendricks wants him back but McNally tells him he's no use to him as the deeds have been signed over to the people and they are both broke. Hendricks is full of rage and guns Ketcham down. McNally shoots Hendricks in the leg and is shot in the leg himself by one of the deputies. A shootout takes place. It isn't long before Hendrick's men are outgunned. After a failed attempt to blow up the cantina with dynamite the remaining men decide to run out on Hendricks. Hendricks tries to stop them from leaving by firing at them. But after using his rifle as a cane to limp with (barrel side down),its become clogged with mud and when he fires it explodes in his face. He limps to his horse but Amelia appears behind him armed with a rifle. He tries to swing around and shoot her but he's not fast enough and she kills him with two shots. Tuscarora is reunited with Marie and Cordona with Shasta. McNally comforts Amelita and limps off with her with Rio Lobo now free from corruption."

Myron persists and the doctor goes through with it. An enthusiastic audience observing the operation applauds the medical achievement and rises in a standing ovation. After the operation, Myron arrives in Hollywood as Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) while in the rest of this movie, Myron pops up from time to time as Myra's alter ego. Myra goes to an acting academy owned by her uncle, Buck Loner (John Huston), a former cowboy star. The real reason for Myra's arrival is to claim her half of Uncle Buck's estate, to which she says she's entitled. Buck Loner stalls by giving her a job teaching the history of motion pictures. Buck Loner has several friends. One of them is Leticia Van Allen (Mae West), an ancient Hollywood talent scout.

Myra, however, cannot and does not want to put Myron totally in her past as being the person who shaped who is she is today. Myra's goal in her new life is to realign the genders largely by breaking down the walls of traditional manhood. Masquerading as Myron's grieving widow, Myra attempts to do so by meeting with her estranged uncle, Buck Loner (John Huston), who operates an acting school. The direct stated outcome of Myra telling him that she feels that she is entitled to half of the valuable Westwood property where the acting school is located is only secondary to her primary mission. She may get some unwitting help in her mission by Casting Director Leticia van Allen (Mae West), who has already broken down many of those walls of manhood all on her own. Myra's plan may be placed into jeopardy if Uncle Buck discovers the truth, he who *knows* that she isn't the widow of that ""fag nephew"" of his.—Huggo Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is already waiting at the surgery room to have his pinus removed by the surgeon (John Carradine). The scenery is a bit weird anyway, because there is public watching the surgery, clapping, making comments, and there is in the background a lady (Thordis Brandt) kind of dancing /cracking a whip. Myron can't wait to have it removed, and he is self-assured when the surgeon tells him that it's the first time he's going to perform the surgery, and tells him that once cut, it won't grown on him again. They compare the surgery to circumcision several times.Cut to Myron, walking by the street and pushing away a cigarette butt from the sign of Veronica Lake. He kind of dances with a girl dressed in a sort of very short and showy wedding dress. They both end up dancing on the street and they get onto a taxi together.

Myra tells him that there was a lost will of Myron, and Myra wants a part of the business. Buck doesn't want to mix lawyers into the matter, so he finally welcomes Myra, who finally will accept a position in the academy earning 1,000 a month, which must have been a huge salary at the time if she keeps quiet about her salary.A student called Irving Amadeus (Calvin Lockhart) who has been in the academy for fourteen years tells her that teachers don't last long in the academy.

Buck interrupts her: he knows that all his students are bad, so he doesn't want Myra to rise their hopes.

However, Julia, who has fallen in love with Barnabas, discovers his dalliance with Maggie. Insanely jealous, Julia intentionally gives Barnabas an overdose of the serum, with the result that he ages to his true 175 years. Barnabas angrily kills Julia, and restores his youth by biting Maggie, taking Maggie into hiding with him. Stokes and Roger Collins quickly research the family history of Barnabas in 1797, and Stokes is convinced that Barnabas intends to take Maggie as his bride.The search extends to St. Eustace, an island off the shore of Maine. When arriving at St. Eustace, Jeff discovers the hard way that both Stokes and Roger Collins have become vampires, and he has to destroy them both; Stokes with the silver bullets intended for Barnabas, and an arrow through the heart for Roger.Jeff tracks the vampire to an abandoned monastery, where Barnabas is planning to make Maggie his bride. Jeff attempts to shoot Barnabas with a crossbow, while Willie, who is also infatuated with Maggie, rushes over to the altar to stop Barnabas. The arrow that Jeff aims at the obsessed vampire hits Willie in the back. Barnabas pulls the crossbow bolt from Willie's back, then Barnabas takes Jeff under his hypnotic control, simultaneously dropping the crossbow bolt to the floor, next to Willie. As Barnabas is about to vampirize Maggie, Willie revives and plunges the wooden bolt into Barnabas's back; the vampire spins to see Willie, and in a rage, strangles the dying Loomis.Wounded, Barnabas' hypnotic control is broken, allowing Jeff to finish him off with the stake, which bursts through the vampire's chest, finally bringing an end to the undead existence of Barnabas Collins. With Barnabas dead, Maggie is no longer in a trance, and recognizes Jeff, who carries her in his arms, both briefly observing the bodies of Barnabas and Willie, before leaving the monastery.After the end credits roll, the seemingly dead Barnabas turns into a large bat and flies away, but this death-defying feat (since he was killed in the traditional manner only minutes before) goes unexplained."
Getting Straight,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065775/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Vietnam vet and former social radical is conflicted by his desire to become a teacher and his sympathy with anti-establishment student protests. Harry Bailey is two weeks away from getting his Masters degree in Education at a liberally-minded university, after his undergraduate degree in English and English literature, his goal to get a teaching certificate to teach high school English. This goal is a far cry from his renowned student activist days when he was in his undergraduate, his intermediate stint in Vietnam which has given him a view of a more stable future as a real adult. But getting his degree is not a guarantee as he tries to juggle the many facets of his life, including getting enough money not only to pay his tuition, but pay his rent, buy food and keep his broken down car running. Those many priorities lead to him often taking what he considers the most expedient route to reach his end goals, which often means getting friends and colleagues to do work for him, including taking tests, despite he having the academic smarts to pass any of his tests easily if he applied himself. But the conflict in his life that may factor into what he does in these two weeks is that goal of a relatively conservative teaching future, albeit in doing what he thinks is a lofty goal of shaping impressionable young minds, versus the pull by his activist friends on campus to go back into activism as they prepare for one protest after another, many related to student rights. This conflict is highlighted in his relationship with fellow student Jan. While the two seem to love each other, their outward goals for their future, both individually and as a potential couple, may be incompatible.—Huggo Harry Bailey has returned from Vietnam and returns to college to earn his masters degree so he can teach English. He is considered a hero among the radical student body, but still sees the absurdity on both sides of the fence. He contends with the reactionary administration and the impetuous, often futile objectives of the restless students. He acts as a mediator between the two feuding bodies. On top of everything else, his girlfriend Jan wants to marry him and live a life in the suburbs. He is cornered and finally lets loose at his own masters degree dissertation meeting, just as the latest protest heats up.—thustlebird"

Scrooge,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066344/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A musical retelling ofCharles Dickens' classic novel about an old bitter miser taken on a journey of self-redemption, courtesy of several mysterious Christmas apparitions. In 1860, cranky old miser Ebenezer Scrooge hates Christmas, loathes people, and defends the decrease of the surplus of poor population, runs his bank exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit and clients, giving a bitter treatment to his own nephew and acquaintances. However, on Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed ghost of his former partner, Jacob Marley, who tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of Christmas Past, recalls his miserable youth when he lost his only love due to his greed, the spirit of Christmas Present shows him the poor situation of Bob's family, and how joyful life may be and the spirit of Christmas Yet To Come shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good, and time is too short, and suddenly you are not there anymore, changing his behavior toward Christmas, Bob, his nephew, and people in general.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil This is a delightful musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel ""A Christmas Carol"". Cold-souled miser Ebenezer Scrooge has a change of heart after three spirit visitations on Christmas Eve. Folks might not have had much to sing about in England in 1860, but this musical will make you believe otherwise. Kenneth More's musical number as the Ghost of Christmas Present is especially entertaining.—Patrick Market <market@eas.slu.edu> Five children sing before doors in 19th century London. Scrooge sends them away without any money.His nephew Fred enters his countinghouse, and suggests that 7PM on Christmas Eve is too late to be working. Mr. Cratchett mumbles, ""Hear, hear!"" but Scrooge threatens him with the loss of his job. Fred invites him to dinner the following evening, but Scrooge refuses and Fred leaves.As the clock strikes seven, Cratchett leaves his desk and asks for his wages. Scrooge gives them with an ill grace and also reluctantly allows Cratchett to have the following day, Christmas, off.The scene switches to a toy shop window where Tiny Tim is watching the mechanical toys. Bob meets them there and, flush with his 15 shillings of wages, they buy preparations for their Christmas meal. Meanwhile, Scrooge meets two gentlemen as he locks his counting house. They ask him for a contribution to feed the poor, but Scrooge refuses. On his way home, he stops by several merchants to demand overdue loan payments, also accepting samples of their merchandise as no more than his due. The children follow him home, taunting him by calling him ""Father Christmas."" and steal his top hat.As he reaches home, the door knocker turns momentarily to the face of his old partner, Jacob Marley. Disbelieving, Scrooge enters his rooms, where he sees a ghostly carriage go past. He sits down by the fire to eat his supper, when all the bells in the house start to ring. They rise to a deafening crescendo, then stop abruptly. Scrooge hears a clank of chains coming up the stairs, and locks his door, but the locks unbolt themselves and the ghost of Jacob Marley enters. Scrooge asks him to sit down, and the ghost does so, although missing the chair. Scrooge tells the ghost he does not believe in him, whereupon the ghost rises in the air, moaning and banging his chains. Scrooge, terrified, admits belief. The ghost explains he wears the chains he forged in life, and that Scrooge has forged one equally as long. The ghost takes him out into the sky, where dozens of phantoms float, and warns him that he may share their fate. The ghost explains that the visit of three ghosts may allow Scrooge to avoid this.When the clock strikes one, the first ghost appears. She takes Scrooge back to his boyhood school, where most of the children are off for a Christmas party. Young Scrooge, however, is left behind. At another Christmas, however, Scrooge's sister Fran comes to take him home, and at a third Scrooge's old master Fezziwig prepares a party with the help of the apprentices. Scrooge doesn't join the dancing, however, as he doesn't know how. But Old Scrooge points out that the money Fezziwig had spent was minimal compared to the happiness that he had brought. He had planned to wed Fezziwig's daughter, and a series of flashbacks occur showing them enjoying time together. The ghost asks why he let her go if he loved her, and they view a final Christmas where she leaves him.Back in his bedroom, Scrooge is ready to pass the whole thing off as a dream, when he hears laughter from the next room. A tall, bearded figure is there with light and a large feast. He offers Scrooge a drink of ""The Milk of Human Kindness"", which he enjoys greatly. The ghost shows Scrooge how to enjoy life, and takes him on a journey to see Bob Cratchett's house. Cratchett proposes a toast to Scrooge, which his wife at first refuses to make, thinking him stingy, but eventually she relents due to the day.When Scrooge asks if Tiny Tim will die, the ghost repeats his words back to him: ""Best that he do it and decrease the surplus population"". They then go to Scrooge's nephew Fred's house, where he is hosting a party. Fred proposes a toast to Scrooge, and says he doesn't think Scrooge is all bad. Scrooge watches the dances and games and wants to get involved, although the ghost gets quite sleepy. Afterwards, Scrooge, nostalgic, wanders back to his house.He wakes in his cold, dark, rooms, and is confronted by the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. They find a crowd of people outside Scrooge's countinghouse, where everyone is very excited and joyful, much to Scrooge's delight. Happily, he gets up to give a speech, not realizing that his own coffin is being taken out of his house behind him. The coffin is taken down the street with a debtor dancing on it, Scrooge never realizing the true cause of the crowd's joy. Before he finds out, the ghost transports him to Bob Cratchett's house, where the family is working on a grave blanket for Tiny Tim. Scrooge asks to be taken to Tim and the ghost obliges by transporting him to a graveyard where Bob lays a flower on Tim's grave.The ghost points Scrooge to his own grave. He falls in, and down a tunnel into a Netherworld. Marley meets him there to show him to his quarters. Marley confirms that Scrooge is dead, and leads him to an icy cold office, with rats. Several devils bring Scrooge's enormous new chain to him, and wrap it around him. As Scrooge shouts for help, Marley leaves, and once again Scrooge awakens in his bedroom.Thrilled to find himself alive, Scrooge rushes out into the street in his nightshirt, and tells a passing boy to order a huge turkey from the butcher. He then proceeds to the toy store where he purchases almost everything in the store. He takes several presents to his nephew, before dressing as Father Christmas and giving out many toys to the street urchins. Next he goes to Bob Cratchett's to distribute presents, including a large mechanical carousel for Tiny Tim. He then tears up his entire debt ledger and gives 100 guineas to the charity workers. In the end he fastens a beard and Santa hat to the door knocker, telling it that he has to go have Christmas dinner with his family."

The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066249/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a bored Holmes eagerly takes the case of Gabrielle Valladon after an attempt on her life, the search for her missing husband leads to Loch Ness and the legendary monster. Director Billy Wilder adds a new and intriguing twist to the personality of intrepid detective Sherlock Holmes. One thing hasn't changed however: Holmes' crime-solving talents. Holmes and Dr. Watson take on the case of a beautiful woman whose husband has vanished. The investigation proves strange indeed, involving six missing midgets, villainous monks, a Scottish castle, the Loch Ness monster, and covert naval experiments. Can the sleuths make sense of all this and solve the mystery?—Joel Preuninger <Jhpreunin@aol.com> Sherlock Holmes becomes involved in the case of Gabrielle Valladon when the young woman is fished out of the river and brought to 221b Baker Street by a cabbie. She's quite beautiful and doesn't really remember who she is or why she mentioned Holmes' name when found. Using his deductive powers, Holmes determines she is Belgian and having retrieved her luggage from Victoria station, that she had only recently arrived on the boat train. She came to England looking for her husband and has no idea how she ended up in the river. Soon however, the case becomes more complex when Holmes' brother Mycroft warns him to stay away and that it involves the security of realm. Undaunted, Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle follow the trail of clues and are soon in Inverness where they encounter both a troop of missing midgets - a case Holmes had earlier turned down - and have an encounter with the Loch Ness monster. Brother Mycroft also has some unexpected information for his brother.—garykmcd Famed detective Sherlock Holmes is hired by a woman whose husband has disappeared. Holmes's investigations lead him to some Foreign Office dealings by his brother Mycroft and to Inverness in Scotland. They lead him to the Loch Ness Monster.—grantss A dusty box is opened at a lawyer's offices, fifty years after being sealed. The box contains Sherlock Holmes memorabilia, such as his cap, his pipe, his magnifying glass, a plaque with the number 221B, a hypodermic needle. Also in the box is a manuscript written by Dr. Watson. It records cases to be suppressed for fifty years because of their controversial [e.g. sexual] content or circumstances. The screen transitions back in time...Sherlock Holmes (Robert Stephens) and Dr. Watson (Colin Blakely) are in their rooms at 221B Baker Street. Holmes complains he is bored, as he has no cases to work on, saying he needs a shot of 5% cocaine. Watson says, ""Seven per cent"", Holmes says he knows Watson disapproves and has been covertly diluting the solution.Holmes, in a bad mood, complains that Watson's case histories, published in The Strand Magazine, exaggerate and embellish and are more lurid than reality. For example, he is barely six foot one, and Watson wrote that he is six foot four. Watson replies ""Poetic license, Holmes!""Still in a foul mood, Holmes yells at landlady Mrs. Hudson (Irene Handl) for dusting stuff on his desk. Later he has the rooms thick with smoke from using a machine to artificially smoke various cigarettes, as part of his research on cigarette ashes.Watson suggests that he might consider investigating why six acrobatic midgets disappeared from their circus act, as is asked of him in one of the letters, but he is rebuffed. The next suggestion is that they go to a performance of a Russian ballet, since someone anonymously has sent them two expensive tickets.At the end of the ballet, the impresario (Clive Revill) invites Holmes, and reluctantly, Watson, to a staff party. Watson parties with the dancers, while Holmes is led to the dressing room of star ballerina Madame Petrova (Tamara Toumanova). Petrova, speaking Russian, offers Holmes a Stradivarius violin in exchange for sex leading to her conceiving a child that might inherit her beauty and his intellect. Petrova says she has read The Hound of the Baskervilles, and also that he was not her first choice, but Tolstoy was too old to function, and Tchaikowski turned out to be not interested in women.Holmes turns her down as delicately as he can, claiming that he and Watson are lovers who are not interested in women either. Petrova angrily throws him out.Meanwhile Watson has been drinking, dancing a riotous storm arm in arm in a circle of beautiful ballerinas. The impresario whispers to one girl that Watson is homosexual, the news is spread from ear to ear, and the girls in the dancing circle are replaced by male dancers one by one. Watson, drunk, wearing a flower behind his ear, finally asks, ""What happened to the girls?"" and, after being told that he doesn't need to pretend as many of the male dancers are homosexual too by the impresario, storms off to Baker Street.Watson berates Holmes for what he said, surmising that the rumour would never die off, particularly because Holmes is not known to have had any relations with women, whereas Watson has been married. Holmes says he wanted to spare Madame Petrova's feelings, doesn't care to have a reputation with women. Watson asked if he would be presumptuous to presume Holmes had had affairs with women. Holmes says ""You are being presumptuous"" as he goes into his room.Soon after, a cabbie rings at the door and wants to be paid. He fished a nearly drowned woman (Geneviève Page) out of the river, in shock, clutching a card with the Baker street address on it. A mysterious looking older man has been watching from across the street, then he gets in the same cabbie's carriage and leaves.Watson convinces Holmes to take a look at her. She has received a blow on the head and is barely conscious. Holmes inspects her shoes and labels on her dress that indicate she is from Brussels. The card she was clutching is illegible from getting wet, but some ink has rubbed on her palm and Holmes reads the number 301 by looking at the mirror image. She is wearing a wedding ring with the names Gabrielle and Emil, but she appears too dazed to give information, although she speaks French. Watson volunteers his bed and sleeps on the couch, and Mrs. Hudson helps her to Watson's bedroom.Not long after, Gabrielle gets up from the bed (totally naked, of course, since Mrs. Hudson is drying her clothes) but still confused. She goes to Holmes talking to him as though he were her beloved husband Emil, whom she has found at last, holding onto him with passion. She retreats to Sherlock Holmes' bed where he sees on her beckoning hands the letters he could not read from the cardboard piece he had found in her hand when they first met. He views the lettering imprinted from her baggage claim ticket on her palm.The next morning, Mrs. Hudson arrives with breakfast and is victorianly horrified to see the naked woman on Holmes' bed. Holmes enters from the street carrying a trunk and a fancy parasol. He recognized the wet card as a possible check stub, and since she was Belgian she would have come on the boat train from the Continent and checked her things at Victoria Station. They break into her trunk and find her last name is Valladon.When Gabrielle wakes, she is better and tells her story. Her husband was working in London and wrote to her often and regularly until a few weeks ago. He is an engineer by profession and said his employer was Jonah. She wrote to him at an address she remembers. She begs Holmes to find her missing husband. Quick research shows there is no English company with that name, and that the address is an abandoned building. Holmes has her write a letter to the address, planning to go spy there the next day and see who picks up the letter. In between these comings and goings, the mysterious older man on a cab is again on the street, and sees Gabrielle's parasol open and close, whereupon he departs.The next day they break into the abandoned building, where they find a cage full of canaries and mysterious tracks but no footprints. They hide as a postman drops a letter in the slot, see an old lady in a wheelchair come feed the canaries from the alley, and porters who come pick up a load of canaries. The letter is left behind, and when they see it, it is addressed to Sherlock Holmes!The letter is from Mycroft [Sherlock's smarter older brother] who orders him to come to Diogenes Club at once, and Sherlock complies.At the meeting, Mycroft (Christopher Lee) orders Sherlock to drop the case, as he knows all about Valladon. Mycroft's insistence doesn't deter Holmes, as the Diogenes Club might be a front for a covert government operation. While they are arguing, Wiggins (Graham Armitage), the messenger at the Diogenes Club enters with an urgent message that requires a reply, and Sherlock hears it -- that the three boxes should be delivered to Glen na Hiruch and the Red Runner to the castle.Back in Baker Street, Holmes decides to disregard Mycroft's orders [after all, he is enjoying Gabrielle's company]. The three take the overnight train to Scotland, where the locations mentioned by Mycroft are, disguised as Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown and their valet. In the night in the bedroom compartment they share, Gabrielle and Holmes trade confidences. Gabrielle asks whether he was ever in love, and Holmes says that he was all set to be married once, his fiancée died of influenza. The way things turned out he considers women to be unreliable and not to be trusted, which is not the same as not liking them. Meantime, in the second class carriage, Watson sits next to a group of monks who do not talk, apparently Trappists. The leader, whom we recognize as the mysterious watcher in Baker Street, is reading a Bible open to the Book of Jonah.They check into a hotel at the shore of Loch Ness. The first location mentioned by Mycroft turns out to be a cemetery. The gravedigger (Sterling Holloway) mentions that one father and two children recently drowned in Loch Ness. He blames the monster.In the next sequences, the clues pile up. Three coffins, one large, two small, arrive, and are buried. Soon four children show up to put flowers on the graves, but as we see their faces, they are not children, but midgets. When Holmes and Watson later dig up the large coffin and open it, Gabrielle shrieks, as we see a youngish man there and three dead canaries that have turned white. The dead man has a copper wedding ring, matching Gabrielle's, except his has turned green. Watson thinks he saw the Monster on the misty lake. Two suspicious porters deliver large demijohns labeled ""Sulfuric Acid "" to Urquhart Castle. Watson sees the squad of mysterious monks walking around. The trio gets on a rowboat to try to chase the Monster, which is also seen through the mist by Holmes and Gabrielle. Holmes borrows Watson's stethoscope, which is always hidden inside his hat, and listens to the sound of a motor running under water. They gain on it but their boat is pushed from below so they all fall into the loch. At the hotel that evening, Holmes receives a magnum of champagne and the coachman insists he must get into the carriage with him. He is driven to Urquhart Castle and told to go up some exterior stairs that have been covered with a red velvet runner leading up to some tents.At the top of the stairs, Sherlock is met by his brother Mycroft, who first scolds him and then reveals the mystery. A submarine was being developed for the British Navy, with Mr. Valladon on the team. The project was called Jonah because the submarine was to be able to stay underwater for three days and three nights. Midgets were recruited as crewmen because they took up less space and needed less air. Sulfuric acid of the batteries accidentally got mixed with sea water, and the mixture released chlorine gas, which killed Valladon, two midgets and some of the canaries. It turned the canaries white and the copper ring green.However, Gabrielle is not Mrs. Valladon but rather a top German spy named Ilse von Hoffmanstal, sent to England with a crew of German sailors, disguised as monks, whose mission is to learn the whereabouts of the submarine and try to steal it. She sent them messages in Morse Code by opening and shutting her pink parasol. They have tricked Sherlock into locating the submarine project, and he fell for it because he became enamored of Gabrielle and could not think properly. When taken out for testing, the submarine was disguised as a sea monster.Queen Victoria (Mollie Maureen) arrives for the christening of the craft with the champagne, but is ""not amused"" when she learns the details because it would kill people without warning from a concealed location, something unworthy of England, and she orders the project scrapped forthwith. Despite Mycroft's pleas that the Germans are developing their own terrible weapons, Zeppelins that could bomb London from the air, she repeats her orders and departs.Before arresting Ilse, it is arranged that the submarine be left unguarded. The squad of monks steals the submarine and sails it off underwater, but it has been rigged to sink.Meantime, Sherlock has returned to the hotel room, where Gabrielle is most fetchingly nude in bed, and we see her from the back as the Rokeby Venus. He is dejected, not only because he has been tricked and another woman and Mycroft have got the better of him, but because he had developed real affection for Gabrielle.Ilse von Hoffmanstal is arrested, but will not go to prison, as she will be exchanged for a British spy at the German-Swiss border. As she is driven off the hotel, she Morse Codes Sherlock back with her parasol, ""Auf Wiedersehen"".Some months later, Sherlock receives a letter from Mycroft, telling him that Ilse was arrested as a spy in Japan, tried and shot. She had been using the alias Mrs. Ashdown.Saddened, the detective retreats to his room to seek solace in cocaine and his violin."

Waterloo,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066549/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Facing the decline of everything he has worked to obtain, conqueror Napoleon Bonaparte and his army confront the British at the Battle of Waterloo. After defeating France and imprisoning Napoleon on Elba, ending two decades of war, Europe is shocked to find Napoleon has escaped and has caused the French Army to defect from the King back to him. The best of the British generals, the Duke of Wellington, beat Napolean's best generals in Spain and Portugal, but has never faced Napoleon. Wellington stands between Napoleon with a makeshift Anglo-Allied army and the Prussians. A Napoleon victory will plunge Europe back into a long term war. An allied victory could bring long term peace to Europe. The two meet at Waterloo where the fate of Europe will be decided.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The film opens on Château de Fontainebleau in 1814. Paris is besieged by the Austrians and her allies. Napoleon Bonaparte (Steiger) is urged by his marshals to abdicate but he refuses, defiant. Upon hearing the surrender of his last army under Auguste Marmont he realises that finally all is lost and accepts the abdication pleas of his marshallate. He is banished to Elba, an island in the Mediterranean with a small army of 1,000. Ney (O'Herlihy) calls it an honourable exile.After a tearful farewell to the Old Guard, he is carted away. 10 months later he escapes from Elba and sails back to France. Michel Ney, now under the allegiance of the restored Bourbon king (Welles) is asked to capture him at Grenoble. Ney agrees, eager to earn the respect of the court, who just the day before insulted his ""low birth"" wife by addressing her as ""Madame"" despite her title. He declares he'll bring Napoleon back to Paris ""in an iron cage"", which Louis XVIII says to himself is an exaggerated expression and an overreaction, typical for a militarist.The two men meet on the road from Grenoble. Napoleon, sensing the mood of Ney's troops, goes forward unarmed and asks them if they really want to fire at him.Instead they greet him with cries of ""Vive l'Empereur!"". Ney is instantly swayed and marches with him and his former soldiers. They return to Paris to a warm welcome by the people. King Louis has fled and the Hundred Days has begun.Napoleon appoints Louis' former Minister of War, Marshal Soult Chief of Staff and he corresponds to the families of the deceased during the war and plans a campaign for the defence of France. He realises he will be attacked but genuinely offers peace to his enemies, who, once more, ignore his communiques and declare war.Prussia and the United Kingdom's forces manoeuvre to counter Napoleon's expected thrust. The armies are not well coordinated and separate, much to the joy of Napoleon, who prepares to place his army between them and defeat one followed by the other.Attention is now drawn to Wellington (Plummer), who attends the Duchess of Richmond's ball, where Picton and other generals are present. One of his soldiers is engaged to her daughter, and the Duchess begs they keep him away from the battlefield so her daughter won't ""wear black before she wears white"". The young officer declares he will bring back a cuirassier's helmet. Picton overhears and points out that if he ever meets a cuirassier, he'll be lucky to escape with his life, never mind a helmet.The ball is interrupted by General Müffling (John Savident), who announces that Napoleon has crossed the Belgian border at Charleroi, much to Wellington's displeasure. He realises that Napoleon has got between himself and Blücher's Prussians and is on the road to Brussels. Hastily looking at his map, he decides that they will meet at Waterloo.The soldiers are now on their way to Waterloo. Attention then turns to Marschall Blücher (Sergo Zaqariadze) who is seventy-two years of age and yet commands the Prussian army and re-buffs advice by General Gneisenau to retreat. Wellington has done so, but Ney returns to Napoleon to deliver his report on the engagement, which angers Napoleon, who had expected Ney to pursue Wellington, who is now free to choose his own battlefield. Wellington arrives at Waterloo, and asks Blücher to join him in the battle but Müffling wants a new horse to reach him. Wellington is not amused. Before this, an Irish soldier plunders a pig for food. Looting is a capital offence in the British Army, but when Wellington catches him the looter claims the pig got lost and he was trying to find her relatives. Instead of punishing him, Wellington orders the soldier to be promoted to corporal, for he ""knows how to defend a helpless position"". Wellington then tells de Lancey:I do not know what they'll do to the enemy, but by God, they frighten me!Napoleon is in pain because of trouble with his stomach but when he is asked whether he wants the doctor, he refuses and following a few minutes, he orders his generals out of his outpost after going through tactics. A storm is raging outside with heavy rain pouring down.The day of the battle dawns bright and dry and Napoleon invites his generals to breakfast. They hear the ringing of the local church bell and are initially surprised, until de la Bedoyère mentions that the pastor intends to go ahead with the sermon, despite the looming battle.Napoleon is in a happy mood compared to the night before but now the commander of artillery brings bad news. The rains of the previous night have made it impossible to manoeuvre the French guns. The battle must be delayed until the ground dries. Napoleon, who agrees with Ney that they had fought with muddy boots previously, alone among his generals realises that each delay brings the Prussians closer. He is annoyed and leaves his breakfast to look at the battlefield.The armies move into position opposite each other. Both commanders take turns to ride amongst their troops. Ponsonby and Wellington both marvel at the precision of the French formations, while Wellington refuses permission to an artillery officer to fire long range shot at Napoleon himself. ""Leaders of armies have better things to do than fire at each other!""The battle starts shortly after 11.30am with cannon fire from the French. Napoleon then sends a diversionary infantry attack against Wellington's right flank, the Chateau of Hougoumont with the view to stretch the Allied line and to ""see the quality of this English aristocrat [Wellington]"". Wellington ignores this attack and keeps his line firm.Napoleon sends the corps of d'Erlon up the ridge where Wellington's men are sheltering from the French guns. As they crest the rise they are locked in fierce fighting but are repulsed by British cavalry. Picton's troops plug a gap in the line, but a French musket ball strikes him in the head through his hat, killing him. Meanwhile, Ponsonby's cavalry brigade, including the renowned Scots Greys, have chased the French all the way back to their lines but have become disorganised and their horses blown. Wellington sounds the recall signal, but it is either not heard or is ignored. Napoleon sends his Polish lancers to attack them and Ponsonby is killed after his horse gets stuck in mud.As the battle proceeds, Wellington reorganises his lines, moving them a few yards further back, so they are out of the reach of the French artillery. While Napoleon has taken a short leave from the field, again stricken with stomach pain, Ney sees the movement and believes the British are retreating, and orders the French cavalry to advance on them. The allied units form infantry squares to repel the massed cavalry attacks. A soldier by the name of Tomlinson (Oleg Vidov) wanders from his square and shouts out, ""we've never seen each other! How can we kill one another?"". He is later seen dead. Richard Hay rallies the faltering squares, urging his men to ""think of England"" before he is struck by a musket ball and killed, much to the upset of Wellington, a good friend.Napoleon returns and angrily rebukes his marshals for allowing Ney to attack without infantry support. The attacks are repulsed and the French have no fresh troops left, yet Napoleon can see that the cavalry attacks have weakened the Allied line. He determines that the farmhouse of La Haye Sainte is the key to the battlefield and orders its capture. After fierce fighting, a French flag flies above it and Napoleon asks Soult to write a letter to Paris that the battle and the war have been won.Napoleon now sends forward the Imperial Guard to smash the failing allied line. He begins leading the men from the front of the formation himself, but his marshals insist he fall back. Wellington is desperate. He asks for ""night... or Blücher!"". Wellington orders the forces on his left flank - ""every brigade, every battalion"" - to abandon their position, to reinforce his center and ""put every gun to them"".At the same time, the French spot Blücher's Prussian army as they emerge onto the battlefield from the woods, with Blücher warning his men that he will shoot any man he sees with pity for the French. A frustrated Napoleon remarks, ""I made one mistake in my life, I should have burnt Berlin"".As the French continue their advance over the hill, they realize too late that Maitland's Guards Division is on the reverse of the slope, lying down unseen in the grass, waiting for the French. Wellington calls out to him: ""Now, Maitland! Now is your time!"". The Guards stand up and at point-blank range fire volley after volley at the French column. The Imperial Guard withdraws, defeated, amid great consternation. Napoleon and Ney attempt to rally the broken army, but to no avail. French morale collapses and a general retreat begins, as Wellington gives the signal for a general advance.The Imperial Guard forms squares in an attempt to ward off the advancing allied forces. Meanwhile, the French retreat has quickly deteriorated into a rout, and Napoleon's marshals physically force the Emperor himself to withdraw from the battlefield.To save their lives, under a flag of truce, a British officer offers surrender terms to Pierre Cambronne (Yevgeny Samoilov), who replies with the famous ""mot de Cambronne"". In a rare departure from real-life events, the British cavalry move aside to reveal a line of artillery, and proceed to blast the obstinate French square, killing most in it. In reality, as the battle had been won, Blücher and Wellington met to signal the defeat of Napoleon, which is not seen in the film.Wellington is not cheered by his victory. As he surveys the desolate battlefield, which has already attracted looters, he laments, in voice over, that ""next to a battle lost, the saddest thing is a battle won"".Meanwhile, Napoleon, surrounded by Ney, de la Bedoyère and his marshals, is seen leaving the battlefield in his coach, knowing that this time his days as Emperor really have ended."

Boxer Jack Jefferson (James Earl Jones) is the world's reigning heavyweight boxing champion. There's just one problem: he is also the first Black heavyweight champion, which bothers a lot of people. Jack's celebration is cut short when he is framed for crossing a state line with Eleanor, his white fiancée (Jane Alexanderin her first film role), a violation of the Mann Act.

He is not only the first Black heavyweight contender; he is also in love with a white woman. Jefferson must not only deal with the hatred of whites, he must also deal with the ostracism of some members of the Black community who feel that he has sold out.—Wayne Hustis <styx@hotmail.com> A boxing match, cheering crowds, wild pandemonium. At canvas level, we see the legs of two fighters who are duking it out. One fighter is white, the other, black. The white fighter is knocked to the canvas. Jack Jefferson (James Earl Jones) becomes the first black heavyweight boxing champion in history.Retired heavyweight champion Frank Brady (Larry Pennell) appears on the front porch of his house and walks into his front yard, a group of boxing promoters, managers and newspapermen in tow. Goldie (Lou Gilbert), Jefferson's manager, boxing promoters Pop Weaver (Chester Morris), and Cap'n Dan (R. G. Armstrong) are among them. From two automobiles in the background, we see that this is the early 1900s. Brady yells, I ain't gonna fight not dinge! Promoters remind him no one thought it 'would work out like this.' Since Brady retired last summer, a black man has become the heavyweight champion. The black man, a 'smart ass' beat his last opponent badly. 'You're the white hope, Mr. Brady!' 'How would you like it if the whole damn country said ""Brady let us down. He let a loud-mouth n--- become champion of the world."" Now Frank, you take a good long look at that belt. ..I know you trust me, and I say you can beat him. And, Franklin, the good Lord hates a quitter.'Frank Brady strides back into his house and reemerges with his heavyweight championship belt around his waist. 'It's gonna be a pleasure.' They can tell Jefferson he said so. The fight will be held in Reno, Nevada, 'white man's, country.'Jack Jefferson is in training at a gym, working the heavy bag with his trainer and corner-man, Tick (Joel Fluellen). Jefferson's white girlfriend, Eleanor Bachman (Jane Alexander), resplendent in a long, cream-colored dress and a beige wide-brimmed hat is watching him train. Jefferson takes a break. He says to Eleanor 'You know you're tired of sitting here, why don't you go buy yourself something pretty.' She refuses. She wants to stay with him, unless he minds her sitting there. He doesn't mind. She's his 'lady luck.' He gives her a long, slow kiss on the lips.Goldie arrives and tells Jefferson he's got the fight with the retired champion. Goldie notices Eleanor. Jefferson introduces them. Goldie warns him about a white girlfriend. He suggests that she leave. Jack says she's staying. Goldie persists. First they hate you for fighting white guys. Okay. They hate you more because you win. Still, okay. Then they hate you so much they're willing to pay through the nose to see you get knocked on your can. Well, that's more than okay. Cash in. But when they start hating you more than that, watch out. 'That means now. I got ears! I get told things!' A white girl? You want to drive them crazy? Jefferson defends his relationship with Eleanor. He ain't foolin' around this time. And she's not going to hide either.The press come in, led by a newspaperman named Smith, 'Smitty' (Lloyd Gough). They pepper Jefferson with questions about the upcoming fight. Think you can take him? How many rounds is it going to go? Any idea why you smile when you're fighting? 'I'm a happy sort of person and always feels good...what I want to put a face on for... It's a sport, a game.'Jefferson's black common law wife, Clara (Marlene Warfield), barges in and charges toward Eleanor, cursing. Tick jumps between them and restrains Clara. The newspapermen write furiously in their notepads. Jefferson yells at Clara to leave. He quit on her when 'she cleared out of Detroit with Willie the Pimp,' and took his clothes, his rings, his valuables. He tells Tick to give her twenty dollars and car fare. Goldie persuades the newspapermen not to print anything about the altercation.Reno, Nevada. The fourth of July. The day of the fight. Jack Jefferson vs. the Great White Hope, Frank Brady. Fireworks. Marching bands. A giant stuffed black doll in grinning blackface, with boxing trunks and boxing gloves and a yellow streak down its back, towers above the crowd. At the weigh in, Jefferson is undeterred, laughing. He taunts Brady. 'Hey Frank, how you doin'?' To Tick: 'Looks like Frank's about to walk the plank!'The crowd is segregated. Whites, for Brady, hurl insults at Jefferson. A group of black men and boys, led by a minister, meet with Jefferson outside the stadium. They've been prayin' for him, praying that the 'good Lord lets you win for us'. Jefferson gets angry. They're not praying for him, as a man, as Jack Jefferson. They're only praying for him as a symbol, as their symbol. He turns and storms away.Jefferson beats Brady and celebrates with his fans back in Chicago. Eleanor is the only white person present. There's singing and dancing and laughing and joking around. Black women swarm over Jefferson, and ignore Eleanor. The whooping and hollering grinds to a uncomfortable silence when a man (Moses Gunn) appears, banging what looks like the lid of a garbage can. He accuses Jefferson of being nothing but the white man's boy, playing the white man's game, and insults his relationship with Eleanor.The local district attorney (Hal Holbrook), holds a meeting of what appears to be upstanding citizens of the community, including a black doctor who criticizes Jefferson for doing harm to his race.Eleanor is called to the district attorney's office, alone, for an 'informal inquiry'. The D.A., Mr. Cameron, questions Eleanor about Jefferson. How they met (on the boat from Australia, she asked the captain to be introduced). She also spent a lot of time in Jefferson's stateroom, of her own free will. She knows the D.A. is trying to use her to get to Jack. She didn't come to tell lies, but she is there to head off any attacks they want to make on Jack through her. She breaks down and sobs. She describes her love for him. Says she's not afraid to have him for a lover. She'll say it to anyone. 'Even if it seemed unnatural,' Cameron asks gently. Eleanor stares at him, then smiles knowingly: 'You slimy, two-bit, no-dick mothergrabber.'After she leaves, Cameron shrugs. Nothing to move on. Zero. I'm not so sure, says an associate. Maybe they can get him on the Mann Act. But that's for prostitution, says, Cameron, 'and she's no pro.' 'I'll have to have a word with the fine print boys,' says the associate, whom we later learn is Jim Dixon (Robert Webber), a federal marshal.Jack and Eleanor go for a long drive in a shiny convertible, and arrive at an idyllic spot in the country. Later that night they are in bed. Eleanor is sunburned. She asks Jack if he's feeling all right. 'You look a little peculiar, Jack.' 'I'm a little ashy. That's how I get sunburned.' They laugh. 'I thought it just bounces off,' she says. She shares a daydreaming fantasy about them being together. She's lying in the sun. 'How maybe I'd stay there, and it would keep burning me, day after day. I'd get darker and darker. I really can get dark, you know? I'd dye my hair and change my name. I'd come to you in Chicago like somebody new. A colored woman, or a creole, maybe, huh? Nobody but you would ever guess.'A loud crash and the front door is broken down. Men enter with guns drawn. Dixon identifies himself. 'You drove Miss Eleanor Bachman across the Illinois-Wisconsin state line. Having done so, you proceeded to have relations with her. Under the Mann Act that makes you liable. Therefore I'm placing you under arrest.' 'How much this carry?' Jefferson asks. 'One to three.' 'She clear?' 'Just you.'Word gets out about Jefferson's arrest. In Chicago, friends and family gather at his mother's home. Mama Tiny (Beah Richards) reminisces about her son as an eleven-year-old. She would tell him all of the things that he wasn't allowed to do as a colored child. But he wouldn't listen. 'I hit him with a stick, till I couldn't hit him no more. He pulled away from me and bust it in two and run off.'There's a knock on the door. A group of young men enter--members of a black baseball team. The Detroit Blue Jays. They're Jack's friends, they say. Tick enters: 'A $20,000 fine, three years in Joliet.' He has a week out on bail. Jefferson enters, sharply dressed in hat, jacket, and a bright pink shirt and tie. He stands by the window where two detectives in a car outside can see him. Under his coat, one of the baseball players is wearing clothes identical to Jefferson's. The baseball player takes Jefferson's place at the window, and Jefferson slips out with the baseball team.Jefferson, Goldie and Eleanor flee to Canada, then to England. Members of the press welcome him, enquire about his next fight. Jefferson is issued a summons. In court, lawyers argue over Jefferson being in England. Jefferson says he doesn't want no 'rompus,' he just wants to fight and make a living. The judge replies that the 'American legalities are none of our concern.' However, the license for Jefferson's next match is denied. The judge welcomes Jefferson to remain in London and pursue any 'other means of livelihood' he can.Jefferson, Goldie and Eleanor go to France, where he's allowed to fight. Before the fight, in his dressing room, Jefferson is agitated. Impatient with Goldie and Tick. He refuses to warm up before the fight; he'll warm up 'in there, on the man.' He forbids Eleanor from watching the fight. When it's time, he strides towards the ring. There's no smiling for this match.Eleanor is alone in Jefferson's dressing room. Newspaperman Smith 'Smitty' enters. He asks her how she's doing. She looked so piqued the other day...'and you did go to the doctor...Decided not to have it?' She turns away and asks him to go away. Outside, there's booing, and Smith leaves to find out why. In the ring, amid the boos, Jefferson's opponent is covered in blood, and grasps him feebly. Jefferson swats him to the canvas with the back of his hand.Back in the U.S. Cap'n Dan and other promoters are looking at film of the next candidate to be the Great White Hope. 265 pounds, six foot eight. 'Fresh is what he is...Big. Clean, strong. Real farm boy.' Boxing fans are waiting on their knees for something like him. Cap'n Dan ushers in 'a friend 'of his. It's Dixon, the U.S. marshal. He has a proposal. There's a mass migration of blacks heading north from the fields of the South. Jefferson is a hero to them. In addition, his escape made the law look foolish. This is something they can't have. Dixon makes a proposal. If Jefferson can be made to lose his next fight, Dixon may be able to get him a reduced sentence. Dan sells the plan to the other promoters, including Pop Weaver. Dan puts it to Pop to arrange the fix. Pop looks at Dixon. 'You can't put that deal in writing, can you, mister?' 'I'm sorry, Pop. I wasn't even here.'Jefferson, Goldie and Eleanor travel to Germany. Eleanor walks through a Carnival-like scene. She approaches a table where Jefferson is fooling around, arm wrestling with Germans in uniform. As Eleanor approaches, Jefferson's laugh is silenced. 'You said you'd call for me, Jack. Don't drink anymore.' Jefferson, drunk, mocks her concern, imitates a monkey. Eleanor demands that he stop. You're making a fool of yourself in public, she says. People are looking at him. Angry, he refuses to stop. She says she'll be in her room, and walks away.Goldie approaches. They've got a match. Without prompting, Jefferson asks how much for him to lose? If Pop Weaver wants a straight fight, he don't come sneakin' over here. Eighty-twenty split. A hundred grand for Jefferson, and his sentence is cut to six months. Even though he has no money and can't get a match, Jefferson refuses. Sarcastically, he asks Goldie if he has enough money to go home.In Hungary, Jefferson plays Tom, and Eleanor appears as Little Eva in a stage production of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Tick appears in drag as Topsy. Jefferson makes eye contact with a man in the audience, Pop Weaver. Neither man smiles. Catcalls drive the three performers off the stage.World War I has started. Nightfall. Jefferson, Tick and Eleanor are at a train station. Weaver appears. He hands Jefferson a piece of paper. Jefferson's mother is 'very low.' Jefferson thanks him for coming around. Weaver says it's finished for Jack. You can't stay over here. What's it all for? Staying champ a little longer. 'Champ don't mean piss-all to me, man...That champ stuff done been clear out of me... That championship belt is nothing but a hunk of junky hardware that don't let go. I'm stuck with it just like you stuck needin' it off me. So just knock me for 10 and take it. I'd be much obliged.' 'Believe me,' Weaver says. 'We'd rather have it straight.' Jefferson grabs him by the collar. He wants a match with the best they've got. He'll go to Mexico. 'Right up next to ya.'In Juarez, Mexico, Eleanor walks from a dingy rooming house, across an unpaved street. She passes people in old, torn clothing, and stray animals wandering aimlessly around. She's carrying a plate of food. Her cream-colored dress is now little more than dirty rags. Jefferson is working on a heavy bag in what looks like a stable converted to a makeshift gym. There's straw on the ground and the walls are all dirty. Eleanor brings the plate of food. There's still no word that a boxing match will happen-no cable, no letter, nothing. 'Jack, will you talk to me...Do what they want you to, Jack.' 'I told you to keep out of it.' 'I can't keep out of it...Say yes and get it over with, will you...You're letting them do this to you, it's worse...You're not your own man anymore, Jack. They have you and you know it. At least you can buy yourself back from them. ...Look at this grease you swallow for them.' He tells the story of how he was cheated in the ring by a white man when he was young. He doesn't want her to ever see him go down to a white man. He doesn't want to hear anything from her abut 'living.' He wants her to leave. 'I want to stay, even if you-' 'You can stay with your own.' 'Why can't you wait and give me one chance to make you happy?' He takes a rag and repeatedly slaps her with it. 'You win, Daddy,' she says, and slowly walks out the door. Jefferson is alone in his training area. The door opens. Dixon and another man approach. He introduces himself as 'El Jefe'. Dixon: They're making it easy. The match will be held in Havana. 'You fight the way you're told, turn yourself in, you'll get a suspended sentence.' Or else they'll throw the book at him. Jefferson replies, maybe they can tell him how they'll throw the book at him, since that 'book' is in the U.S. and he is in Mexico. El Jefe says his country needs to cooperate with the U.S Government. So Jefferson must fight. Jefferson refuses. He intends to walk right out that door. El Jefe pulls a gun. He will shoot Jefferson if he has to. Jefferson walks towards the door. The door opens. Tick and two Mexican officers carry Eleanor's limp body in. She threw herself down the well. 'Busted her neck.' Jefferson carries her over to the wooden table used for his rub down. 'Oh, baby.' He dissolves into tears. 'Set that fight up. I'll take it now.'The big fight in Havana. Brady, the former champion whom Jefferson beat earlier on, is now the referee. Jefferson is taking a pummeling. Goldie and Tick look at each other in dismay. Dixon looks on as well, self-satisfied. Between rounds, Jefferson strolls to his corner and sits down. One eye swollen shut, bloodied. Goldie tells him to 'lay down, already. You won't have a head left. You hear me. This round, you understand!' Jefferson nods. In the audience, Pop Weaver and Cap'n Dan are all smiles. They'll be getting the belt back, and this time they'll 'keep it in the family. Round 11. Jefferson continues to take a pummeling. He locks eyes with Goldie. Goldie nods. Jefferson is knocked to the ground. The count goes to eight. Jefferson gets to his feet and starts whaling on his opponent. Goldie screams at him to stop. Dixon, Weaver and Cap'n Dan, startled, jump to their feet. Jefferson's opponent drops to the canvas. The bell rings.Back in his corner, Goldie pleads to his fighter. 'I'm beggin' ya like you're my son. They'll kill ya.' Round 12. Jefferson continues the pummeling. But he's exhausted. He clinches the much bigger man, and holds on to him. The clinch is broken and Jefferson is knocked to the canvas, but gets back up. He's knocked down again, and gets back up. He's knocked down a third time and stays down for ten. The new champion is hoisted on the crowd's shoulders. Brady holds the belt above his head. Goldie and Tick carry Jefferson from the ring."
Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065466/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three girls come to Hollywood to make it big, but find only sex, drugs, and sleaze. This film is a sequel in name only to ""Valley of the Dolls"" (1967). An all-girl rock band goes to Hollywood to make it big. There they find success, but they also sink into a cesspool of decadence. This film has a sleeping woman performing on a gun which is in her mouth. It has women posing as men. It has lesbian sex scenes. It is also written by Roger Ebert, who had become friends with Russ Meyer after writing favorable reviews of several of his films.—Mark Logan <marklo@west.sun.com> A hip and happenin' all-girl rock group heads to Los Angeles to claim lead-singer Kelly's inheritance and make it (and make it) in LA. They immediately fall under the spell of rock'n'roll Svengali and 'Teen Tycoon' of rock Ronnie 'Z-Man' Barzell, and other rapacious Hollywood party types as lustful porno actress Ashley St Ives, ravenous lesbian Roxanne, and shady lawyer Porter Hall. Soon the girls fall into a morass of drugs and deceit as their recording success soars. It takes several tragedies to make them stop and think... but is it too late?—R Lindsay The film concerns three young women, Kelly McNamara (Dolly Read), Casey Anderson (Cynthia Myers), and Petronella ""Pet"" Danforth (Marcia McBroom), who are in a rock trio called The Kelly Affair. Harris Allsworth (David Gurian) is their manager and Kelly's boyfriend. At the beginning of the film, Kelly gets the idea to relocate to the West Coast and look up her estranged Aunt Susan. It seems that Aunt Susan (Phyllis Davis) is holding a large inheritance that would have been shared with Kelly's mother, had she been alive. Kelly feels as if a share of this money could be hers, so the foursome sets out for Hollywood.Aunt Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, and even promises a third of the fortune to Kelly, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor Porter Hall looks down on the girls, deeming them ""hippies"". Meanwhile, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant and well-connected rock producer named Ronnie ""Z-Man"" Barzell (John LaZar), who urges the girls to give an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties. The number goes over so well that Z-Man takes the band under his wing, changing their name to The Carrie Nations, much to the chagrin of Harris. Harris is even further demeaned when Kelly gets involved with a gigolo named Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett), who knows about her inheritance and wants her to claim as much of it as possible so that he can bleed her financially. Harris has a fling with porn star Ashley St. Ives (Edy Williams). Casey, who clearly mistrusts men, is pursued by lesbian clothes designer Roxanne (Erica Gavin). Meanwhile, Petronella has a very sweet, proper romance with law student Emerson Thorne (Harrison Page).The Carrie Nations take off as rock stars, but their personal lives begin to unravel. Porter Hall wages war on Kelly to get her to drop her claim for her share of the inheritance, and his scheme backfires; spurred on by Lance, Kelly changes her demands to half of the fortune instead of a third. When Porter realizes that Susan intends to honor her wishes, he attempts to buy Kelly out with an offer of $50,000.Ashley dumps Harris because he doesn't respond to her charms or her voracious sex drive. She insults him by suggesting that he is really gay, which causes Harris to suffer a mild identity crisis. Harris confronts Lance at Z-Man's house, and Lance immediately assaults him in front of the whole party. Despondent, Harris takes up with Casey for the evening, and the two of them engage in a moment of lovemaking fueled by pills and alcohol. Petronella is upset by Harris' humiliation at the party, and she is comforted by heavyweight champion Randy Black (James Inglehart); unfortunately she takes him home and beds him, and their interlude is interrupted when Emerson comes home unexpectedly. Emerson is nearly killed when he confronts Black, who attempts to run him down with his car.Casey wakes up next to Harris and goes berserk, accusing Harris of raping her. Kelly dumps Lance after the incident at the party, but the damage has been done; Harris attempts suicide by leaping from the rafters of a soundstage while The Carrie Nations are filming a television appearance. The girls find out that Harris will likely be a paraplegic. A mortified Casey reveals that she is carrying his baby, but Roxanne convinces Casey to have an abortion. Casey finally gives in and becomes Roxanne's lover, seemingly finding happiness at last with her. Kelly devotes herself to caring for Harris, and Emerson forgives Petronella for her infidelity.The final act of the film takes place at Z-Man's beach house; Z-Man invites Lance, Casey, and Roxanne to a private party at his house, where he gives them superhero costumes to wear and they take large amounts of drugs. After retiring to their respective rooms, Casey and Roxanne make love while Z-Man attempts to get Lance to make out with him. When Lance rejects him, Z-Man turns violent, hogtying Lance and threatening him with a sword, calling himself ""Superwoman"". Ultimately, Z-Man unbuttons his shirt and reveals his shocking secret to Lance: Z-Man has real female breasts, and seems to have been a woman all the time. The revelation causes Lance to laugh in disgust, calling Z-Man ""an ugly broad"". Z-Man immediately decapitates Lance with his sword. Casey and Z-Man's servant witness the murder; Casey tries to hide as Z-Man chases the servant down to the beach and murders him. Z-Man rushes back up to the house and produces a gun, which he uses to murder Roxanne. Casey places a frantic phone call to Kelly and the others, but Z-Man finds her and kills her with a shot to the head. Kelly, Petronella, Emerson, and Harris arrive too late and are attacked by Z-Man. Petronella is wounded in the shoulder after Z-Man shoots her, but in the ensuing fight that follows, Z-Man is killed in self-defense with ""his"" own gun. As they all react in horror to what has happened, suddenly Harris regains the sensation in his formerly paralyzed legs.Afterwards, there is a brief montage discussing the fates of the various characters in the film; how their choices have led to their ruin, those who died either from said choices (Lance and Z-Man) or by the cruel twist of fate (Roxanne and Casey), and the hope of a second chance that the surviving characters have been given at the end of the film. The film concludes with a triple wedding: Aunt Susan weds a former beau of hers, while Kelly marries Harris and Petronella marries Emerson."
Darling Lili,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065611/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set during World War I, this movie is a cute spin on the Mata Hari legend. In World War I, Lili Smith (Dame Julie Andrews) is a beloved British music hall singer, often providing inspiration for the British and French troops and general populace singing rallying patriotic songs. She is also half-German--her real last name is Schmidt--and an undercover German spy, using her feminine wiles to gather information from the high-ranking and generally older military officers and diplomats she seduces. Masquerading as her Swiss uncle, Colonel Kurt Von Ruger (Jeremy Kemp) is not only her German handler, but her lover. Kurt's boss, General Kessler (Carl Duering), doesn't fully trust Lili as she is still half-British, so it irks him that Kurt has entrusted Lili with the important mission of finding out more about the Allied air-defense plans, as air is becoming a more important battleground of the war. Of the five men who are most privy to such information, Kurt believes the best target is American pilot Major William Larrabee (Rock Hudson), as he is a single young ladies' man. Lili is more than easily able to strike a romantic and sexual relationship with Bill, but her mission is threatened when she learns that two French agents believe that Larrabee is passing information to a female German spy. But Lili believes she's also stumbled onto some vital information when she accidentally learns from one of Bill's pilot compatriots, T.C. Carstairs (Lance Percival), of a secret mission code-named ""Crepe Suzette"". Crepe Suzette (Gloria Paul) ends up being a game-changer for Lili, not only with her position as a spy, but in her relationship with Bill. The outcome of ""Suzette"" also threatens both Bill and Lili's lives.—Huggo Set in Paris during World War I. Lili Smith/Schmidt (Dame Julie Andrews) is a German spy being requested to go undercover to help Germany during the war, to try to find out their plans. Her ""uncle"" wishes her to fulfill the operation, but one of his colleagues believes that she's incapable of performing such an operation as she's half-British. Soon she is following Major William Larrabee's (Rock Hudson's) every move and spending all of her time either with him or thinking of him. Her ""uncle"" realizes she's in love with him, but Lili is not facing that she is. Things and people are coming between her and her true fate. But what is it?—OneSpecialJulie <julu3@hotmail.co.uk> Lili Smith is a young British singer/dancer at the time of the first World War in 1918. In the opening scene of the movie, Lili sings ""Whistling away the dark"" to a crowd of theatregoers. An air raid interrupts her performance and a frenzy ensues. The panic is calmed by Lili, who leads the crowd in a rendition of ""Pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag"", ""Keep the Home Fires Burning"" and ""It's a Long Way to Tipperary"". During the air raid, a German submarine surfaces. This vessel carries Colonel Kurt von Ruger, a spy. He is revealed to be Lili's handler and lover, but he masquerades as her Swiss uncle when an investigator arrives at Lili's house.Col. von Ruger gives Lili her next assignment: seduce Major William Larrabee, an American squadron leader and young, single, ladies' man. Maj. Larrabee is thought to have access to top secret air force information. The Colonel also mentions that Lili is ""to be decorated by the French government.""The next day, General Kessler (with his henchman, Otto Kraus, for protection) speaks to the Colonel and tells him that he does not trust Lili. Lili is revealed to be half German, her real last name being Schmidt. She left Germany at the age of 10 and hasn't been back since. Her English mother (Lili is a British subject) and the fact that she is a female teenager lead Gen. Kessler to believe she can't be trusted, whereas those characteristics are what the Colonel believes makes her the perfect spy. The General, however, does not have the authority to override the Colonel, so he vows to try and obtain it.While the higher-ups are fighting, Lili is serenading men at a hospital in France (""The Girl In No Man's Land"", ""Smile Away Each Rainy Day""). Major Larrabee sees her there, but she does not see him.Lili then goes out to a dinner where she is supposed to meet Maj. Larrabee. However, he is not there. She is, however, greeted by Maj. Larrabee's squadron, who bring her home (""It's a long way to Tipperary"" reprise, ""Mademoiselle from Armentières""). One of the members, Lt. George ""Youngblood"" Carson, kisses her goodnight, with the intent of being kissed on the cheek, but Lili kisses him on the lips and he swoons. The squadron leaves (""Mademoiselle from Armentières"" reprise). Lili then calls Col von Ruger, who says he will eat breakfast with her, and she tells him Maj. Larrabee is on an important mission, according to one of the squadron.Lili meets Maj. Larrabee that night when he organizes a serenade outside her window. He then takes her on a picnic at 3:00 am.The next day, Maj. Larrabee and Lili go out to a restaurant (""Whistling away the dark"" (French)"". Lili extracts information from him and feeds it to the Colonel on a horseback ride the next day. The Colonel tells her she may need to sleep with the Major.Later in the day, two French agents come to Lili's home and ask her to spy on Major Larrabee because they believe he is passing information to a female spy the major is with romantically. Lili refuses to cooperate with them, knowing the agents are actually searching for her. Lili says that if she stops seeing the Major, the flow of information will stop and then she will be found out, but if she continues seeing him then the agents will find her anyway.Lili performs, once again, at a theatre (""I'll give you three guesses""). She leaves before her curtain call to meet Major Larrabee in her dressing room, where the couple kiss passionately. Major Larrabee says he is tired because he was fighting behind enemy lines. He says he must get back to the squadron Sunday night. The duo go out to a restaurant with Col. von Ruger following them. The two French agents arrive and tell the Colonel to find them seats close to the Major because they have mistaken the Colonel for the maître d'hôtel. One of the French soldiers whom Lili serenaded at a hospital, T. C. Carstairs, speaks to Major Larrabee and mentions an ""Opération Crêpe Suzette"". The angered Major tells him to shut up.On the drive back to Lili's place, Maj. Larrabee explains to Lili that T. C. is always drunk, even when he flies, because he is scared of heights. Lili then calls Colonel von Ruger and tells him the new information. The next day, Lili and Major Larrabee go on a walk and sing with some children in the countryside. They retire to a hotel, where Lili attempts to figure out what ""Opération Crêpe Suzette"" is. The French agents attempt to spy on the Major by climbing his roof, but the rain outside makes the operation slippery and they almost alert Lili and the Major to their plot. The Colonel, wanting to meet with Lili, delivers champagne to her room as a signal.When Lili meets with Col. von Ruger, he tells Lili that the Major has lied to her. He hasn't been in the air or behind enemy lines. The Colonel now thinks that Major Larrabee is cheating on Lili. To test this suspicion, Lili ""accidentally"" pours champagne on his shirt as they kiss. Then she tries to get him to take his shirt off. However, Major Larrabee senses there is something wrong, but Lili steers the conversation so they end up arguing, then kissing. They then get into bed, but Lili cannot stop laughing. When she finally pulls herself together, she accuses Major Larrabee of calling her ""Suzette"", though in reality he has said nothing. Fooled, Major Larrabee says he called her ""my pet"". Lili visibly does not believe him, and continues laughing when they kiss. The Major, turned off and angered, leaves, but Lili apologizes sincerely and the couple goes back to kissing. Lili interrupts them again and tells the Major that she still does not believe him and pressures him for details of Crêpe Suzette. Maj. Larrabee tells her that it was a secret military operation. Lili, knowing the information is false, gets angry and leaves in the rain.The French agents fall off the roof into a pool. Lili is so angry as she walks past them that she doesn't notice. She says she will return to Paris. The Major delivers her home when Lili cannot start his car herself. Angry and wet, Lili goes to take a shower. The Major follows her, and then accuses Lili of devising the whole fight to avoid having sex since he believes she is a virgin. The duo make up and it is implied they have sex in the shower.Major Larrabee flies the next day. Lili, meanwhile, meets again with the French agents who ask her once again to spy on the Major. They are absolutely certain that there is someone who is extracting secret information from Major Larrabee. They believe it is Suzette Maldue, a performer who goes by the name of Crêpe Suzette. This is the woman with whom the Major is having an affair. Lili, along with the agents, goes to see one of her shows with a distinctly sour face and is shocked to discover Suzette is a striptease dancer. An enraged Lili goes home, cursing.Lt. T.C. and Maj. Larrabee hijack a German plane and use it to blow up an air force military base (""It's a long way to Tipperary"" instrumental reprise). Lili incorporates a striptease into her (usually straight-laced) performances (""I'll give you three guesses"" reprise). Her routine even manages to stun the unflappable Col. von Ruger. Lili tells the Colonel what she knows about the bogus Operation Crêpe Suzette. Her ""uncle"" asks if she's jealous, to which Lili calls him an ass.Major Larrabee visits, hobbling around on a cane as Lili plays the piano. As Lili mentally recalls Suzette's performance, she grills Major Larrabee on his whereabouts. When he says he was flying, Lili kicks his injured leg and speaks to Colonel Kurt von Ruger, who confirms the veracity of the Major's testimony. Lili takes a shortcut through a bedroom, where the maid and butler are having sex (though Lili does not notice), and tries to apologize to Major Bill Larrabee. He refuses to reconcile and leaves, saying he has an important meeting, asking Lili to believe him. Lili pretends she does, but she follows him. Bill is going out to lunch with Suzette. Lili takes her notebook, filled with German spy information, and tells the butler to put it under Suzette's mattress.Lili telephones the French agents and says she now must ""out"" Suzette as a German spy. Suzette and Bill are both arrested for high treason. The Colonel, reading the news story, asks Lili what she thinks. Lili, restraining herself from emotion, says that their secret codes must be changed, as they were contained in the notebook. Lili tells the Colonel that the French agents would have discovered her spying if she didn't throw them off the trail. The Colonel replies that it was a way to eliminate a rival for the affections of the Major. Lili calls Colonel Kurt von Ruger an ass, which Kurt says is just proof that she loves the Major - she has only told him that when he accused her of being in love with the Major. Lili starts crying as the duo arrive. The Colonel remarks that she should look happy, because it isn't every day a German spy is awarded the French Legion of Honour.While being questioned by the French government, Suzette says she did have an affair with Major Larrabee, but he took her to lunch to say that he was in love with another woman (Lili). Lili is dubbed Knight of the Legion of Honour (""La Marseillaise""). Kurt says good-bye to Lili, reminding her she is only half-English as he says ""until we meet again"" in German.General Kessler greets the Colonel. He has obtained permission from the Kaiser to overrule any and all of Kurt von Ruger's decisions. The General says he will use a minor excuse to kill the Colonel. The butler tells the maid that Lili is unstable and they should hide the news concerning Major Larrabee from her, but the maid tells Lili that Suzette is proclaiming her innocence. The butler turns out to be right, as Lili reveals her spy identity to the officials to try and help the Major as the butler and the maid prepare to flee, knowing something is amiss with the Colonel. General Kessler gives instructions to Kraus to kill Lili ASAP. The butler stuns the General, allowing the Colonel to flee. He goes to collect Lili. Kraus, almost shoots Lili but he instead hits Colonel Kurt von Ruger's arm. Lili and the Colonel go to the train station. They are to go to Switzerland. The Colonel tells Lili she should never have said she was a spy. Suzette and the Major would have been exonerated because she knew nothing. Now, the government knows Bill has actually passed information to a German spy: Lili. Colonel Kurt tells her that going to Switzerland will fix their problems.Kraus trails the duo, with the intent of killing them. Lili and the Colonel board the train. General Kessler finds the maid and the butler packing. Lili becomes completely unglued, as the wounded Kurt tries to comfort her. Kraus is on board the train. Meanwhile, the French agents tell Major Larrabee that Lili is a German spy. The Major, angered, locks the agents in his bathroom and goes to find Lt. T.C., who is drunk and has broken in to the facility where Maj. Larrabee is being held.Kraus holds Lili and Colonel von Ruger hostage. He would kill Lili, but, as Kurt explains, Kraus would have to kill the Colonel too, which he isn't allowed to do unless provoked. Lieutenant T.C. and Major Larrabee arrive to investigate Lili's house as the maid and butler are being tied up. The French agents intend to do the same, but their car gets in an intentional accident and they are delayed. Major Larrabee unties the maid and the butler. German airplanes shoot at the train. The passengers jump out of the train to avoid certain death. American airplanes from Major Larrabee's squadron save them by returning fire. Major Larrabee drops his goggles and cap as a token of his love for Lili (""Whistling Away the Dark"" instrumental reprise).Armistice is declared. Lili, now in Switzerland, sings for a War Relief Fund (""Whistling Away the Dark"" reprise). One by one, each member of Major Larrabee's squadron shows up in the wings of the stage showing they forgive Lili for her espionage. Major Larrabee walks to Lili at the end of the song. They kiss to end the show. (""It's a long way to Tipperary"" reprise)"

Tikon tells his former master that the chairs, along with all other private property, had been appropriated by the State after the Russian Revolution 10 years earlier. Vorobyaninov and Bender set off together to locate the chairs and recover the fortune, but are stymied by a series of false leads and other trying events.

Father Fyodor makes the long journey only to be thrown out of the engineer's house.

Vorobyaninov and Bender leave him to his fate.After traveling many miles and perpetrating numerous cons to pay for the lengthy enterprise, the two men return to Moscow where they discover the last chair; because the others contained no hidden treasure, this one must contain it all. It is located in a Palace of Culture, which is inconvenient due to the presence of so many witnesses. Vorobyaninov and Bender return after closing time, entering through a window Bender secretly had unlocked earlier.At the moment of discovery, Bender carefully and quietly opens the chair cushion with his knife, but their hopes are dashed as it is found to be completely empty. Vorobyaninov is stunned and angry, but Bender laughs at the absurdity of the situation. A watchman finds them, and Vorobyaninov demands to know what happened to the jewels. ""Look around you,"" the watchman answers, explaining that after the jewels were accidentally found, they were used to finance construction of the grand building in which they stand. Driven into a sudden rage, Vorobyaninov smashes the chair to pieces and assaults the officer whom the watchman has summoned. After admonishing him for hitting a policeman, Bender leads the way and they escape into the night.At the end of his patience, demoralized and bankrupted, Bender proposes that he and Vorobyaninov go their separate ways. In a desperate attempt to keep Bender from leaving, Vorobyaninov flings the remains of the last chair into the air, and collapses to the ground feigning an epileptic seizure; this is an act they had previously rehearsed as part of a con. Bender calls for the crowd's attention and begs the passers-by to give generously to this sad and stricken man. Using simple gestures without uttering a word, the two men cement their partnership in crime."

Althea, who watches the 1968 race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans.One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has inexplicably changed; he is a black person. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the ""black"" off him, but finds it doesn't work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the ""Negro in the bathroom"" is him.At first, Jeff believes this to be the result of spending too much time under the sun lamp.

His boss doesn't seem to ""get"" that Jeff has turned black but asks him if he is spending too much time under his sun lamp as his tan is very dark.

The manager comes outside and again Jeff politely tries to explain he is meeting someone for a business lunch and asks the manager to get the man inside to clear it all up but the manager refuses and the police are called. They bring Jeff back to his office and ask his boss if he is in fact his employee and when his boss confirms that he is, the police leave him there again without making an arrest. His boss is still not fully understanding about Jeff's condition but sees that somehow this can help drum up business.After work, Jeff goes his local physician Dr. Wainwright (Kay E. Kuter) and makes an appointment who is equally shocked and cannot explain Jeff's ""condition"" either but agrees to look into it.The next day, Jeff is forced to sit at the bus stop instead of running to catch the bus to avoid any more hassles with white people. Jeff is forced to sit in the back of the bus by the current segregation laws to leave the front seats only for white people. At lunch, Jeff is now forced to go across town to eat at a diner which is a ""blacks only"" eating place. After a second visit to Dr. Wainwright for his ""skin condition"" reveals nothing of the ordinary about his skin, his racist doctor shows his own ""true colors"" when he suggests that Jeff might be more comfortable with a black doctor and refuses to consul with him anymore.Returning home that afternoon, he finds the front door locked (which it usually isn't) as well as the curtains and shades drawn, and Althea afraid to leave the house, look out the windows, or answer the ringing phone. He doesn't understand why until he receives an anonymous phone call from an unseen man who says: ""move out, nigger!"" Jeff is forced to take the phone off the hook for the night since it keeps ringing every few minutes with more anonymous phone calls from racist people telling him to move out. Also, unseen people throw eggs and splatter black paint at his front door and windows.At work the next day, a secretary named Erica (Kay Kimberly), who had previously ignored him, makes several advances toward him, finding him more attractive as a black man. Mr. Townsend suggests that they could drum up extra business with a ""Negro"" salesman which he persuades Jeff to travel to African-American neighborhoods across the city to pitch more of his sales over the next few days as Jeff becomes more observant to other black people and how they live.After returning home from work one evening, he finds four men in his home who had apparently made the threatening phone calls to his house (despite their unconvincing denials), who offer him $50,000 to move out of the neighborhood despite the fact they have known him for several years. The racist neighbors tell Jeff right to his face that they don't want a ""nigger"" living on the same street at they do. Jeff manages to raise the price to $100,000 by using some veiled threats about moving ""his people"" into the neighborhood. After the men leave, Althea, somewhat angered that Jeff used his new race to blackmail his neighbors into bribing him to move out of the neighborhood, sends their two children away to live with a relative. Burton and Janice tell Jeff they they are both awkward and uncomfortable with their father being black. On top of all that, they are now being bullied at their school by their classmates over their father's new racial affiliation.Although she still loves Jeff, Althea's sanity begins to break from the stress of the whole thing of Jeff now being black and of the neighbors continuing to make harassing phone calls and leaving threatening letters. As a result, she leaves him to rejoin her kids and move far away, thus leaving Jeff alone and without a home to live in.Finally accepting the fact that he is black (and always will be for the rest of his life), Jeff goes to work the next day where he tells off his boss for exploiting his race by telling Mr. Townsend that he quits and vows to open his own insurance business. Jeff moves out of the all-white suburban neighborhood and into a small apartment in a black neighborhood in the downtown part of the city. Jeff then starts his own insurance company which soon becomes successful due to his education and expertise. Jeff also starts a tryst with his former secretary, Erica, whom continues to be turned on by his new negro appearance. However Jeff still manages to communicate with his wife while he embraces his new race by going out evenings to ""blacks only"" nightclubs, restaurants, bars, and other places.The very last scene shows Jeff practicing martial arts with a group of black menial workers, apparently having become one of the militants he used to verbally put down."

This is the story of a black man who has been elected sheriff in a U.S. southern county, due to the vote of blacks. He receives a huge amount of hostility from the non-tolerant white establishment, making his job very hard. The white former sheriff has his own struggle, as he balances his devotion to the law with his family and community relations.

Price is greeted only by Mayor Parks (Fredric March), an elderly and local patriarch who admonishes Price to consult him before appealing for outside help in solving problems.

Price instead hires another black man for a deputy, a Vietnam veteran named Bradford Wilkes (Richard Elkins).After his first day while in office, Price's wife Mary comes to the police station to pick him up and when they go outside they discover Price's car vandalized, which prompts Price to drive through the town in a police car with the siren blaring and lights flashing as a protest.Price's first arrest, on a charge of manslaughter, is John Braddock (Bob Randome), the son of an influential white man.

The Virgin and the Gypsy,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066528/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story, adapted from a novella by D.H. Lawrence, tells how the daughter of a staid Rector in the north of England, rebels against her family by having a relationship with a gypsy, and how ""the voice of the water"" triumphs in the end. Movie adaptation from the novel by D.H. Lawrence, discovered after the celebrated author's death in 1930. A romantic love story tells of a prim young English girl who is sexually attracted to a seductively virile gypsy. The climatic dam burst is linked with the consummation of her desire.—alfiehitchie It can be seen as a moral fable. The tale relates the story of two sisters, daughters of an Anglican vicar, who return from overseas to a drab, lifeless vicarage in the post-war East Midlands. Their mother has run off, a scandal that is not talked about by the family. Their new home is dominated by a blind and selfish grandmother along with her mean spirited, poisonous daughter. The two girls, Yvette and Lucille, risk being suffocated by the life they now lead at the Vicarage. They try their utmost every day to bring colour and fun into their lives. Out on a trip with some friends one Sunday afternoon, Yvette encounters a Gypsy and his family and this meeting reinforces her disenchantment with the oppressive domesticity of the vicarage. It also awakens in her a sexual curiosity she has not felt before, despite having admirers. She also befriends a Jewish woman and her amour. When her father finds out about this friendship, he threatens her with ""the asylum"" and Yvette realises that at his heart her father, too, is mean spirited and shallow. At the end of the novel, one of the daughters is rescued during a surprise flood that washes through the home and drowns the grandmother. The rescuer who breathes life and warmth back into the virginal Yvette is the free-spirited Gypsy. The flood could be seen as a metaphor for washing away the old, oppressive life, and welcoming in the new freedom. Ironically, when we discover the Gypsy's name at the very end of the novella, he becomes mundane and ordinary and the mystique is taken away. - Wikipedia"

Selma knows that not all is perfect in their life, but she doesn't know the full extent of the problem beyond the work insecurity issue and thus how best to provide the support he needs. Despite these failings, he is on the verge of landing the biggest account of his career with truck manufacturer Lepridon, an account about which he has mixed feelings. On the one hand, getting the account would boost his name in the business. On the other hand, in his own words, ""who wants to draw trucks for the rest of their life"". His life problems culminate the outcome of a drunken decision at a neighborhood party.—Huggo The film opens on a scene in a New York City apartment. We see a man, an artist, painting a picture of a woman. Nearby, a young lady-the subject of his painting-is gathering up her coat and other stuff to leave. As she walks around getting her purse, her coat, etc. she passes another painting in which she again was the model. She leaves the apartment and he grabs his coat and a briefcase and goes out after her. Under the credits the two of them walk through the city, clearly having an intense discussion that we don't get to hear, but it's clear that they have an intimate relationship with each other and it's possible that she's breaking up with him. We later learn that the man is Brooks Wilson, played by George Segal and the woman's name is Grace. Grace, it turns out, is Brooks' mistress, played by Janis Young.Brooks goes home to Westport, Connecticut, and immediately heads for a school, where some children are performing a dance recital. He watches for a moment before walking the halls of the school to find a bathroom so that he can smoke a cigarette. Of course, he's immediately busted by a small dancer who comes in and tells him there's no smoking. Brooks walks into a classroom and contemplates the childrens' artwork, then he draws a train on the chalkboard before returning to the recital, which has ended. The first adult he bumps into is Nelly, played by Nancie Phillips. Nelly is very flirtatious with Brooks but he's mostly ignoring it, finally pointing out that her husband and his colleague Will (David Doyle) is approaching. He finds his own family and compliments his daughter's dancing. His wife Selma, played by Eva Marie Saint, asks him about something called Lepridon, but he says there's still been no decision.Back at the house, Brooks puts Selma through a series of poses and then photographs the two of them together as models for an illustration he's working on. In between, Selma wonders aloud whether his getting the new account means that they can look for a bigger house. Brooks seems preoccupied with getting the photo shoot done.The next day, Brooks has one of the photos he'd taken in a light-box, so he can work on the illustration project. The phone rings and it's his agent Edward, played by Keenan Wynn. Edward tells Brooks that he has a meeting in a few hours in the city, to meet with Mr. Lepridon himself. So Brooks has to get his act together and hurry into New York. This, of course, is the perfect time for his neighbor across the street, Mr. Kramm (Edgar Stehli) to bug him about the overall condition of his house. Brooks pushes him out of the house and sits down to breakfast with his family. His daughters are rambunctious and frequently arguing with each other, and it's clearly wearing on him.At the train station, Nelly spots Brooks from her car and invites him to lunch, probably with an ulterior motive. Brooks again brushes her off, saying he has an appointment in the city. He almost seems to respond in kind when she points out that Will is watching from the platform. Will is polite but a little distant.In the city. Brooks gets to his meeting and runs into Skip Geiser, an assistant of Mr. Lepridon played by Roy Scheider. Skip apologizes and tells him that the meeting needs to be moved to the afternoon, at the construction site for the new Lepridon Building. So now Brooks has the better part of a day to kill. Brooks gets to Edward's office and has a conversation with him through a stuck door during which Edward tells him that he'd arranged for a lunch meeting at the Illustrators Club, to interview about a magazine cover. Brooks is reluctant to go, because he's tired of doing all these small jobs. He'd much rather have one large project to work on.Brooks buys a rose and shows up at Grace's apartment, but instead of Grace, he finds a man playing the clarinet. Brooks says he has to get something, and the man just nods and returns to playing the clarinet. As he leaves he tells the man to tell Grace he'll call later.Brooks finds Grace at the art gallery where she works and confronts her about the guy in the apartment. Grace is evasive and tells him she wants her key back. Brooks tells her he thinks he's getting the Lepridon account but she doesn't care. He promises to tell his wife it's over that night.At the Illustrator's Club. Brooks is at the bar, and we learn that he's not a member of the club. After a rather humiliating encounter with a colleague and an older member of the club, and tries to escape, but he bumps into Benny, the guy he's supposed to be meeting. Benny has a lot to say but he doesn't have the galleys that Brooks needs. Brooks joins another table, and it becomes more obvious that he's been drinking a lot. He meets with a woman named Susan, played by Sherry Lansing, and Al, another illustrator who's apparently curated an exhibit that Brooks finds rather macabre, given that all the artists are dead. His comments clearly irritate Al and he and Susan leave. Brooks stumbles repeatedly on his way out of the club.A couple of hours later, Brooks gets to the Lepridon Building. Skip meets up with him and learns that Lepridon is considering using photography rather than illustration for his truck ads. Lepridon (Sterling Hayden) isn't totally impressed with Brooks' samples, but did appreciate a Christmas card that he'd received from Brooks, specifically because the card was religious in nature. The card was actually sent by Selma.Lepridon thinks that photos are more honest than illustrations and what's more, he can't understand why the ads have half-naked girls in them. He walks away but Brooks pursues him and initiates a conversation with Lepridon, faking his way through a conversation about trucks. This actually impresses Lepridon, but the fate of the deal is still up in the air.Brooks arrives home, still a little drunk, and he and Selma get into an argument. But shortly afterward she asks about Lepridon. Of course, he still doesn't have an answer for her.Brooks is reviewing slide images of trucks when he impulsively drops in a slide of a photo he'd taken of Grace. At that point Selma walks in and tries to convince him to just relax a little for the evening, but it just re-kindles the argument.
The next day we see Brooks walking through the countryside near his home, flashing back on his relationship with Grace. In the next scene, Brooks is painting a nude model, with his daughter playing nearby. This leads to a series of interruptions from the phone, and then Edward's assistant Charles (James Manis), looking for corrections to several illustrations. And then the oven timer goes off. And then the doorbell again, and it's Mr. Kramm. Brooks just slams the door in Kramm's face, then tells Charles that he's refusing to make any artistic changes until he hears from Lepridon. Finally he returns to painting the nude.
Brooks and Selma go into town to run some errands with the girls. While they're in town they bump into Grace, who's there with her aunt, played by an uncredited Betsy von Furstenberg and her uncle Marve, played by Paul Sparer. They're in town buying stuff for a big party they throw every year. Brooks learns during the conversation that Grace has quit the gallery and will be going to Europe for an extended stay.Brooks and Selma go to visit a house that's for sale. The couple who own the house are there, and it transpires that they're selling the house because they're getting a divorce. The couple have a tense conversation and after the husband leaves, the wife is clearly uncomfortable telling them about how they enjoyed the room they're all standing in. After the tour, Selma apologizes to Brooks because she knew there was a divorcing couple in the house, but she was hoping they could get a good deal if they saw it early. Selma begins to break down and Brooks consoles her.While getting ready for the party, Brooks and Selma have a lighthearted conversation but the conversation turns to talk of the house and becomes an argument that lasts all the way to the front door of the party. There are dozens of people there and the house is full of technical marvels. Grace is there, of course, but she's ignoring Brooks. Brooks bumps into Will, and will notices Susan, who's getting the tour from Marve. Marve demonstrates an entertainment center hidden behind a bookcase, but the entertainment center also features a closed-circuit video system that allows someone to monitor the entire house.
Brooks goes upstairs to an empty bedroom and places a phone call to Edward, who tells him that he's got the Lepridon account. Selma walks in as he hangs up, but Brooks lies to her and says he still doesn't know for sure. They appear to reconcile and Selma wants to go back home but Brooks protests that they just got there. They begin close-dancing in the party, and Grace watches from across the room. Later, Brooks lures Grace into a pantry and begins kissing her, trying to convince her not to go to Europe. Grace says she loves Brooks but notably he doesn't reply in kind. Grace flees the room.Brooks sits on the stairs, getting drunk. Susan gets very drunk and has to be carried upstairs. Brooks overhears another party-goer talking about art but he's terribly pretentious and worse yet, he doesn't entirely know what he's talking about. Brooks calls him out on it and it nearly starts a fistfight.One of the witnesses to this is Nelly. They're both a little drunk and Nelly is being Nelly, so they go off together. Outside, Brooks and Nelly are fooling around in a her car but they eventually move to the children's playhouse on the property. Unfortunately, Brooks has forgotten all about the closed-circuit video system and they're busted when someone fooling around with the entertainment system switches over to the video feed and then just walks out of the room. Will gets into a brawl with Brooks which most of the guests are content to just watch until Marve finally breaks it up. As everyone finally goes inside, Grace is left standing on the porch watching Brooks try to recover before she finally goes inside as well. As Brooks retrieves his pants from Nelly's car, he hears his own car revving up; it's Selma trying to leave, but she's stuck in the snow. Trying to placate her, Brooks tells her he got the Lepridon account. She beats him repeatedly with her purse and then spits on him. The two are left just looking at each other in the cold, snowy driveway."

In the early 1950s, Martha Beck, who lives with her slightly senile mother, is the head nurse in a Mobile, Alabama hospital. She is bitter about her life, she not having male companionship in large part because she is overweight, while her bitterness in turn does not endear her to people.

Their differences in style causes problems, Martha who is more direct, more impatient and more violent, she who is the first to consider killing to get what they want.

Francois Truffaut named it as his favorite American film.—alfiehitchie The film opens by introducing Martha Beck (Shirley Stoler), a supervising nurse in a hospital that is said to be in Mobile, Alabama. Martha catches two underlings having a brief romantic interlude in one of the labs and berates them for doing so. Martha is bitter and vindictive; she is overweight and lonely, lashing out at those who are unlucky enough to be under her command at the hospital, while at home she is saddled with an elderly mother (Dortha Duckworth) who still calls Martha her ""little girl"". Martha's best friend, Bunny (Doris Roberts), surprises Martha by sending for an application to a lonely hearts club, thinking that all Martha needs to be happy is a man.At first Martha is resentful that Bunny has done this, but soon she is corresponding with a suave man named Raymond Fernandez (Tony Lo Bianco). Raymond gives Martha a vague representation of his life in New York, and comes to visit her after many weeks of exchanging letters. Martha is smitten with the handsome Ray, and their relationship immediately turns sexual. In a bizarre twist, Martha gives her mother a sleeping pill so that she and Raymond can be alone, then the two of them share a sexual encounter while her mother sleeps nearby on the couch.When Raymond returns to New York, he borrows a small ""loan"" from Martha, then sends her a telegram from New York saying that he can no longer correspond with her. Martha is despondent and enlists Bunny's help in pulling an extreme stunt: she tells Raymond that she has attempted suicide because she cannot live without him. Raymond seems flattered by Martha's devotion and invites her to New York, where he makes a startling revelation to her: he is actually a con man who meets lonely women through various lonely hearts clubs, then takes them for as much money and valuables as he can. After meeting Martha he realized she had no assets and moved on, but Martha is willing to forgive him for his deception. Raymond seems to be interested in Martha's strange devotion to him, and he tells her one day he will marry her for real.When Martha returns home to Mobile, she finds that her supervisor has uncovered some torrid correspondence with Ray that Martha had stored in her desk. Martha lashes out at him bitterly and resigns, claiming that she went to New York to be married and her final check can be made out to Mrs. Ray Fernandez. At home, Martha continues the charade, telling her mother and Bunny that she and Raymond have been married. Raymond is furious, especially when he realizes that Martha intends to bring her mother along with her to New York to move in with Ray. Raymond forbids it, saying that Martha can come but she absolutely cannot bring her mother, even going so far as to tell Martha to ""put a pillow over her face"" to get rid of her. Instead, Martha puts her mother in a rest home and abandons her, even though she weeps and pleads with Martha to take her along. Finally the woman curses Martha as she leaves, leaning out of a window and shouting after her ""Goddamn you! I hope you end up like this! I hope someone does this to you.""Martha and Raymond immediately begin their new business of swindling lonely women out of their savings, starting with a spinster schoolteacher. Raymond tells her that Martha is his ""sister"", and Martha accompanies them on their honeymoon, but Martha takes the new bride's belongings the first night and the bride storms out in a fury. Martha pays her no mind, threatening to expose the woman's torrid correspondence with Raymond to her superintendent.Martha seems to have no problem handling this first victim, who is unattractive and mawkish.

Myrtle Young (Marilyn Chris) is a spunky Southern woman who makes no secret about her attraction to Raymond. She has hired Raymond in a business transaction; Myrtle is pregnant out of wedlock, and she wants Raymond to pose as her husband to save face for her family. However, when she finds Raymond handsome, she turns on the charm, much to Martha's jealous displeasure. When Myrtle buys Raymond a toupee as his wedding gift, Martha scoffs at it, but Raymond lies and tells Martha that he bought it for himself. Myrtle later sneaks into Raymond's bedroom and tries to seduce him, while Martha watches in secret. Raymond rejects Myrtle's advances, but Myrtle reveals Raymond's fabrication about the toupee to Martha, who becomes furious. When her conversation with Myrtle turns hostile, Myrtle tells Martha that she is now married to Raymond and she intends to make a go of it. She plans on taking Raymond back to her wealthy family in Little Rock, where she will introduce him to her family, sending Martha back to Mobile on her own. In response, Martha gives Myrtle a handful of pills that
make her violently ill. The next morning Raymond, knowing Myrtle is gravely ill, puts her on a bus for Little Rock, promising to drive her car and belongings there and meet her. But after he leaves her on the bus, she dies and her body is discovered by the bus driver.Raymond next arranges a meeting with a younger woman named Evelyn (Barbara Cason) who has a large home near a lake. Martha and Raymond bicker the whole time they are at Evelyn's; Martha even goes so far as to suggest that Evelyn pair her off in a bedroom with Raymond, which strikes Evelyn as strange since she has been told Martha and Raymond are brother and sister. Finally, when Martha spots Raymond making out on a blanket with Evelyn, she hurls herself into the lake and tries to drown herself. Raymond pulls her out, kissing and comforting her, while Evelyn looks on, confused and disturbed.Aborting their con on Evelyn, Raymond decides it is time to give Martha what she has always wanted: a suburban home.

Janet is well into her 70s and is sitting on a bank account worth over ten thousand dollars, a fact that she happily discloses to Raymond. They move in quickly on Janet, with Raymond proposing to her and Janet moving out of her apartment and going back to Valley Stream with Martha and Raymond. Janet, however, is irritating to Martha from the very beginning, arguing with Martha about petty finances and making vaguely critical remarks about Martha's weight.They get Janet back to Valley Stream under the pretense of Janet marrying Raymond (who has told her his name is ""Charles Martin"") and then using her ten thousand dollars to open a hat shop. They get Janet to write them checks that they will presumably take to the bank and cash, absconding with the money.But just after she signs the checks, their deception begins to unravel. Martha and Raymond leave Janet alone so they can go to the basement and make love. When they all go to bed that night, Janet becomes suspicious and cannot sleep; she wonders why Martha and ""Charles"" took her away from Albany without even allowing her to call her daughter and son-in-law. She questions Martha about how well-hidden the checks are. Martha becomes short with Janet and wants to give her a sleeping pill, but Janet is neurotically afraid of pills and won't cooperate. Their argument spirals out of control until Janet becomes determined to use the telephone to call her family. Martha, of course, becomes hysterically angry over it and slaps Janet, raging at Raymond to ""give her back her checks and put her on a train back to Albany."" Janet goes to her belongings and finds her jewelry missing. Janet finally understands that she is in great danger and begs Raymond and Martha to let her call her daughter. Finally Martha and Raymond realize that they must kill Janet to keep her from talking. Martha hands Raymond a hammer, and Raymond tells her ""You do it. If you love me, you'll do it."" Immediately Martha strikes Janet in the head with the hammer. As she lays bleeding, Martha and Raymond tie a tourniquet around her neck and choke her to death. Martha reacts with calculated precision, barking at Raymond ""Get her off the rug!"", while Raymond seems terrified at what they are doing. With Janet now dead, Martha and Raymond make love, with Raymond stripping nude in front of Janet's body before going into the bedroom with Martha. The next day, Raymond and Martha dispose of Janet's body by putting it inside her traveling trunk and burying it under the floor of their basement. They send letters to Janet's family announcing that Janet has married and gone to Florida with her new husband.Raymond and Martha's next victim is Delphine Downing (Kip McArdle), a widowed woman living alone with her young daughter, Rainelle (Mary Breen), who is around four years old. Martha and Raymond are living with Delphine, and Raymond promises Martha in a private moment that Delphine will be their last victim; he feels she has enough assets to allow Raymond and Martha to finally marry after they swindle her. Martha, however, is frustrated because she and Raymond no longer have much of a sex life because of their living conditions with Delphine. Raymond, as usual, swears he has no attraction to Delphine and that he hasn't made love to her.However, when Raymond takes Rainelle out for the day, Delphine is alone with Martha and confides in her: Delphine is pregnant with Raymond's baby. She tells Martha they've been making love every time Martha left the house, and that Raymond forbid Delphine to tell Martha they were physically intimate. Delphine thinks it is because Martha has puritanical values, but she wants Martha's help in breaking the news of her pregnancy to Raymond. She also wants Martha to suggest that Raymond marry Delphine on Valentine's Day.Martha is, of course, furious that Raymond has lied to her and has been making love to Delphine. She tells Delphine that Raymond will never marry her now, and that the only way to handle the situation is to abort the baby. To do this, Martha gives Delphine a handful of pills, but Delphine refuses to take them. Raymond comes back with Rainelle as Martha struggles with Delphine, and he walks into the situation unsure of what is going on. Martha tells Ray that Delphine has ""found out everything"" and was going to call the police. Delphine now realizes that she is in danger and begs Raymond to help her, but Raymond tells Martha to get Delphine's gun, and he shoots Delphine in the head. Martha debates what they should do with Rainelle; Raymond wants to abandon her at a children's home, but Martha feels Rainelle is too old and will remember details about them. She goes to the basement and fills a washtub with water, then takes Rainelle downstairs and drowns her in it, while Raymond listens upstairs, horrified.Martha has resigned herself to the fact that Raymond will never be truthful to her. Raymond promises that he can set up another meeting with another victim in New Orleans, and he swears to Martha he will not touch her or make love to her. ""I didn't touch Delphine, did I?"" he rationalizes. Martha kisses him passionately and goes upstairs, where she phones the police and summons them to the house pretending to be a neighbor. When the police arrive, she goes downstairs to let them in, kissing Raymond one more time.In the film's denouement, Martha is in prison, where a matron meets her to take her to her first day on trial for the crimes she has committed with Raymond. This will be the first time she has seen Raymond since her incarceration, and she is excited. The matron gives Martha a letter from Raymond, which Martha reads alone as she sits on a bench. In the letter, Raymond professes his love for Martha again; he tells her she is the only woman he will ever love, and the only woman he has ever loved. He looks forward to the possibility that one day when they are old, they may have a short time to spend together. The film ends with a title card that informs the viewers that Martha and Raymond were executed for their crimes while incarcerated in Sing Sing prison."

The Angel Levine,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065400/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Morris Mishkin is an elderly Jewish tailor plagued by hard times who prays to God for help and receives it in the person of a most unusual angel named Levine, a young, black, Jewish hustler from somewhere between Harlem and Heaven. Morris Mishkin is a elderly religious Jew in New York. His wife Fanny is very ill. He's a tailor, but he can't work because his back has given out. He doesn't even have enough money for Fanny's medicine. Finally, a black fellow appears from nowhere in the Mishkin kitchen. He says he's an angel from God, sent to help Mishkin. The black angel is even Jewish, named Alex Levine? But will Morris believe in the angel? And can the angel perform the miracle that he promises?—Martin Lewison <milst1@yahoo.com> Things couldn't get worse for Jewish tailor Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel). His shop has gone up in flames, his daughter has married outside the faith and, worse yet, his wife is slowly dying. But just when he decides to give up on God, a mysterious man (Harry Belafonte) appears, claiming to be his Jewish guardian angel. Doubtful that the stranger is Jewish, never mind an angel, Mishkin must overcome his skepticism if he wants one last chance at redemption. ""Infused with a warm, wry wit"" (Los Angeles Times), The Angel Levine is a moving examination of the need to believe and the desire to be believed in. Featuring ""wildly funny dialogue"" (Time) and a ""superb cast"" (LA Herald-Examiner), this modern-day morality tale is a poignant and entertaining gem. Morris Mishkin is an elderly Jewish tailor plagued by hard times who prays to God for help and receives it in the person of a most unusual angel named Levine, a young, black, Jewish hustler from somewhere between Harlem and Heaven. The crux of the story centers on the angel, who has only 24 hours in which to convince Mishkin of his heavenly mission - while in the balance hang three lives. What is required is a mutual act of faith, from which will spring a common salvation. But alas, although Mishkin does come to believe in Levine, he does so in the 25th hour. A hip African-American angel returns to Earth to help a Jewish tailor re-examine his life. (Josiah Howard, ""Blaxploitation Cinema: The Essential Reference Guide."")The story opens with Morris Mishkin, an elderly Jewish tailor (played by Zero Mostel) at the welfare office trying to get assistance paying for his wife's medicine. When he returns home we see that he and his wife, Fanny, live in a deteriorating neighborhood in New York City. Fanny (played by Ida Kaminska) is in bed and appears to be very ill. Morris tries to make her comfortable and then sits down to rest. Fanny tells Morris that she'd promised her friend that Morris would sew a new suit for her friend's son. Morris tells Fanny he will not, as the woman still owes him for a suit he made for her. Fanny says that she told her friend not to worry about the money. This upsets Morris, who tells Fanny angrily that they need the money, and he will not make the suit. Fanny becomes so upset she knocks over the tray of medications on her nightstand and then falls limp on the bed. Morris goes to her, worried, and tries to revive her. It appears as though she has died. Morris summons a friend to come immediately. He then recites a prayer to God to help him and falls asleep from exhaustion.When Morris awakens, it is dark and as he gets up to turn on lights, he finds a young black man sitting at his kitchen table. He is frightened that the man is there to harm him, and frantically searches for a weapon, coming up with a ladle instead of the knife that he he'd been reaching for. The man (played by Harry Belafonte) calmly takes the ladle and puts it away. Morris is having difficulty breathing, so the man helps him sit down and asks if he can help. Morris asks for water and when the man opens a cupboard to get a water glass, Morris jumps to grab a jar that has some money in it. The man returns the money jar to the cupboard and takes out a water glass. Morris also indicates he needs a pill that is near the sink, which the man gets for him.Having finally regained his composure, Morris asks the man who he is. The man introduces himself as Alexander Levine. Confused, Morris asks him, ""You're Jewish?"" Alex answers that he was Jewish and had been so willingly up until then. When Morris asks why he is no longer a Jew, Alex reveals that he is an Angel sent by God to help Morris. Morris cannot believe the man is an Angel and asks why he has no wings. Levine says that he is only recently deceased and has to help somebody first. Morris asks him to perform a miracle and Levine says he cannot yet perform miracles. Morris keeps trying to get the man to leave, as his wife is gravely ill. When he says this, the angel tells him that she is resting. Morris rushes to Fanny's side and sees that she is indeed resting and is in a different position on the bed from when he last saw her.The doorbell rings and Morris rushes to answer. He looks in the kitchen quickly; Alex is still in there. When Morris answers the door, he finds Dr. Berg (played by Mila O'Shea), the friend he'd called earlier. When Dr. Berg asks what the emergency was, first Morris tells him about his visitor. Dr. Berg looks in, and there's no one there. Morris tells Dr. Berg that Fanny was very ill. They enter her bedroom, where she's sitting up, alert and healthy looking. She does not seem to recall the earlier argument or that she'd either fainted or possibly died. The doctor sends Morris out of the room so he can examine Fanny, who he is surprised to find feeling well.Meanwhile Morris tries to return to the kitchen, but the door is locked... and Morris goes around to look in a tiny window to see Levine on the telephone. Alex has called a woman named Sally (played by Gloria Foster). In their conversation it comes out that Alexander owed some money to a someone who is sending people to collect it or kill him, and they've been harrassing Sally. He arranges to meet with her at a bar.When Dr. Berg finishes the exam, he exits the bedroom and wonders just what it was that made Morris call him earlier. Morris asks Dr. Berg to look in the kitchen. This time he sees Alex just as he's hanging up the phone. The Dr. Berg introduces himself and asks Alex who he is. He replies that he's an angel and asks Dr. Berg if he believes that. Dr. Berg replies yes... and Alex says 'just like that?' ...and Dr. Berg reaffirms and calls his wife to let her know he will be home soon. Alex asks Dr. Berg what's wrong with Mrs. Mishkin, and he explains that her heart does not properly pump blood. The trouble is, he explains it in a very technical way and Alex doesn't understand. Dr. Berg finally tells him that Fanny is dying and that no angel or medicine will stop it.Alex becomes upset that nobody believes he is an angel, and he leaves. Almost immediately Fanny starts coughing uncontrollably. When Dr. Berg and Morris go in to check on her, she complains that she cannot breath and that she feels almost as if she's drowning. The doctor makes her as comfortable as possible and gives Morris a prescription to get filled at the local pharmacy. He leaves and Morris rushes to the drugstore. When he gets there, he finds out that the meds cost more than he has and pleads with the pharmacist to sell it to him at a discount. The pharmacist explains it is a new medication and must be sold as prescribed. During this exchange, we see Alex watching through the window. Morris leaves with the prescription in his hand, which Alex snatches and goes in to the store, where he creates a distraction, sneaks behind the pharmacy counter, and pockets the pill bottle on the counter. He then exits the store and gives the pills to Morris.When they return to the apartment, Morris keeps asking Alex how he got the pills without the prescription and how he paid for them. He realizes that Alexander stole the pills and begins complaining. Alex than tells him to take the money from the jar in the kitchen and go pay for the pills. Morris states that is their grocery money, and Alexander retorts, ""Do you want to eat, or do you want your wife's pills""? Morris realizes he needs both. He then invites Alex to a drink at a bar. When they get there, Sally shows up and Morris uses that as an opportunity to ditch Alexander.Morris returns home and checks on Fanny... Morris wants to go to bed and Fanny wants to talk. Alex and Sally show up... Alex has a few private words with Morris who first shuts the door on Sally, then reopens it and beckons her in. Morris lets them in and allows them to use a spare room to talk. Sally tells Alex about the people looking for their money and asks if he has it. He tells her that the money won't be a problem anymore, but does not tell her he is an angel. They talk, and at one point start to kiss and fool around on the bed. Morris opens the door to check on them, closes it, and starts to make a lot of noise in the bathroom, then running the sewing machine to make a suit, which Fanny tells him to stop. Alex tells Sally she is all he has, all that will be left of him when he's gone and tells her he truly loves her... and Sally tries to talk with Alex about their future and states that she wants to marry him. He tells her he can't but won't say why. They argue, Sally provokes Alex with insults, and Alex slaps Sally so she leaves.Morris finds Alex lying listlessly on the bed and offers to talk and help. Alex doesn't say much, puts on his coat and leaves the apartment, going up to the roof. Morris follows him and finds him standing on the ledge as if about to jump. He states that no one believes in him or cares, and Morris tells him that he believes and cares, and that Alex should come back to the apartment and be welcome.When they return, Fanny is up and has set the table for dinner. She asks about Alex, and when Morris introduces him as a friend, she says, ""Be welcome"" and sets another place at the table. Alex states he is an angel, and Fanny stops, looks at him, and asks if he has come to take her. He replies that no, he's come to help her live, and she states that she wants no help and has been ready to die for some time now. She then leaves the two men alone and lies down on the bed. Morris and Alexander eat dinner, drink wine, and enjoy the meal.As they talk, Alex says he can feel a change ever since Fanny saw him. Morris still won't believe Alex is an angel sent from God, and he begins to tell Alex that he doesn't believe in God anymore. This conversation has begun to upset Alex who begins to cry out. The two men begin to argue, and as Morris continues to complain about God, Alex begins to fade away until he is gone. Morris looks in on Fanny, then sits down and begins laughing hysterically, finally falling asleep.Later Dr. Berg shows up and goes to examine Fanny, who tells him that she does not feel well; he suspects her time has come. He wants to call an ambulance to take her to a hospital, but she refuses, saying she wants to die in her own bed in her own home. He wants to call in Morris, but Fanny says no. He tells her that Morris has a right to be there, to which she replies that over the years they shared many things, but that she did not want to share this. She allows Morris to look in and they start speaking in the their old language (Yiddish perhaps), and finally as he turns to go, he looks at her lovingly, waves his hand, and says a final goodbye.As he exits the room, he notices a hat that Alex left behind. We then see Morris wandering around New York with the hat, showing it to various black people, who shake their heads. He then spies a synagogue and goes in. He sees a group of young black people praying and sits down in a pew. Then he's gone and has left the hat behind. As he wanders back home, through an open lot, a black feather floats overhead. He tries to catch it, but it stays just out of his reach... and the last we see is the feather dancing in the sky."

Before she can utilize her knife, the police arrive and subdue Monica.It is revealed by Inspector Morosini that Monica was a victim of a sexual assault and lived with the trauma of it for many years. In a transference-of-guilt, Monica imposed upon herself as the assailent and killed all those women as a way of re-enacting the assault on her and her loyal husband Alberto covered up for her and was the one trying to kill Sam to prevent him from finding out of his wife's murderous activities. With the case finally wraped up, Sam and Julia fly back to America."
The Cross and the Switchblade,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068428/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Long before faith-based films became a regular feature of mainstream movie theaters, there was ""The Cross and The Switchblade,"" the story of Pastor David Wilkerson and gang member Nicky Cruz. David Wilkerson is a relatively-young parish priest in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania. With nominal funds, insufficient even to get a hotel room which forces him to sleep in his car, his church sends him to New York City to bring the word of God to the young men and youth of the Egyptian Kings, who are on trial for their violent gang activities. David hopes God will be their salvation. Although David is not allowed to get near the Egyptian Kings, his trip to the courthouse garners much publicity; because of it, David meets a tough street youth named Little Bo, who offers to introduce David to the main gangs still out on the streets, namely the mixed-white Mau Maus and the predominantly-Black Bishops, who are fighting each other for territory. Who the gangs hate more than each other, however, are the authorities. David turns his attentions to the two gangs and wants them to know that God loves them no matter who they are or what they do, and in doing so will guide them to make the right choices in life. He and his messages may be difficult to penetrate into the groups, but the general consensus is that if he can get through to Nicky Cruz, one of the leaders of the Mau Maus, he will be able to get through to anyone. But David hopes to get through to them all at his own risk, especially as Nicky continually threatens him. Another whom he sees who is especially in trouble is Rosa, Nicky's ""girl,"" who will do anything to get the money to get her two-injections-per-day heroin fixes.—Huggo Long before faith-based films became a regular feature of mainstream movie theaters, there was ""The Cross and The Switchblade."" The film was made squarely within the Hollywood system, yet was set apart by its producers' unashamedly Christian vision. It went on to become a worldwide ministry phenomenon and it stands among the early sparks that ignited today's growing Christian film movement. Based on David Wilkerson's same-titled 1963 autobiography, the film depicts the unlikely efforts of a ""skinny country preacher"" to bring change to the desperate lives of gang members living and dying on the mean streets of New York City. Among those whose lives were transformed was notorious gang-leader Nicky Cruz who went on to lead a decades-long outreach to gang members and other distressed young people. Wilkerson's mission to tell lost and hurting young people that there was a better way through Jesus Christ, blossomed into the Times Square Church and the international ministry of World Challenge whose mission is to bring lasting holistic change to individuals and communities. Although this 1970 film bears the style of a different era, the life-changing solution that David Wilkerson brought to desperate lives remains forever relevant. And 50 years later, for all its retro elements the film still stands up to scrutiny as a well-written, stylishly-produced movie featuring sincerely passionate performances. The story lives on in the book, in this film, but more importantly in the legacy of lives transformed by the message that no one is ever so far gone that they cannot find the way home.—William Carroll"

Scream and Scream Again,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064949/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A serial killer who drains his victims' blood is on the loose in London. The police follow him to a house owned by an eccentric scientist. In London, a serial-killer drains the blood of females and the Detective Superintendent Bellaver and his team are hunting down the so-called Vampire Killer. Meanwhile in an undefined country that lives a military dictatorship, the cruel Konratz is climbing positions killing The Power that Be. When the Vampire Killer flees from the police, he seeks refugee at the real estate of scientist Dr. Browning and jumps into a tank of acid. Dr. David Sorel is intrigued with the powerful acid and decides to get a sample. He finds the truth about the research of Dr. Browning.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A London jogger suddenly collapses on the sidewalk and awakens in a
hospital where he finds that his right leg has been amputated. Shortly
thereafter, his left leg is amputed, followed by the amputation of both
arms. He can get no information from his zombielike nurse. Meanwhile,
somewhere in a Gestapo-like country in Eastern Europe, military agent
Konratz [Marshall Jones] lets slip to his superior, Captain Salis [Peter Sallis], that he knows about the
top-secret K-718. Because K-718 is classified information supposed to be
known only to Salis and his superior, Major Benedek [Peter Cushing], Salis tries to
contact Benedek, but Konratz kills Salis before the call goes through.
With Salis dead, Konratz moves up into his position. When Benedek decides
to dismiss Konratz from duty because his methods of interrogation are too
extreme and will not reflect nicely upon their military regime, Konratz
kills Benedek and moves into Benedek's position.London Detective Superintendent Bellaver [Alfred Marks] also has his hands full with
a series of killings that have been dubbed the ""vampire murders."" Girls
are being found with their throats slashed, puncture wounds on their arms,
and drained of blood. The first was Eileen Stevens, an employee of
esteemed research scientist, Doctor Browning [Vincent Price], but Browning has no idea who
would want to murder her. When another girl turns up dead and Bellaver
realizes that they were both picked up at The Busted Pot (a disco club),
policewoman Sylvia [Judy Huxtable] goes undercover (with a homing device planted in her
shoe) to see if she can get picked up by the vampire. She is successful,
and she and the vampire Keith [Michael Gothard] drive to a secluded field where he attempts
to drink her blood. Keith is interrupted by the police but manages to best
them all and get away. Fortunately, Sylvia's shoe is still in Keith's car,
so the police tail him. Keith drives to a chalk quarry where the police
are astounded to see him running up the almost sheer cliff face...until he
slips and falls back down. Because he is only stunned, the police handcuff
Keith to a car, but he tears off his hand and runs away...straight to Dr
Browning's estate where he jumps into a vat of acid.When questioned about the acid, Browning explains that his research
involves investigating strains of bacteria on animal tissue, so he uses
the acid to destroy the tissue and prevent the spread of disease. Why
Keith would have made for this acid vat, Browning has no idea but assumes
that Keith must have known Eileen Stevens and that she told him about it.
Of course, this leaves no body to autopsy. Much to Browning's dismay,
however, Bellaver still has Keith's hand. Bellaver asks the coroner,
Doctor David Sorel, [Christopher Matthews] to perform an autopsy on it. It turns out to be made
of a synthetic material with human tissue growing around it, cyborg style.British Intelligence Minister Fremont [Christopher Lee] has problems of his own, too.
One of Britain's military aircraft has been shot down while on a spy
mission over the pseudoGestapo country. Konratz has taken the pilot
prisoner and travels to London to meet with Fremont and suggest a
trade...the pilot for all the investigation files compiled on the vampire
murders. Fremont agrees, orders Bellaver to close the case, and arranges
for Konratz, posing as a University professor doing research on the
psychological aspects of crimes of violence, to view the files. Konratz
has other ideas, however, and wants to take the files with him. When
Bellaver refuses to release the files, Konratz puts the squeeze on
Bellaver's shoulder, killing him.Dr Sorel decides to continue the investigation on his own.
Accompanied by policewoman Sylvia, Sorel drives to Browning's estate,
intending to get a sample of the acid from the vat into which Keith
jumped, but the vat has been emptied. Even worse, Sylvia (who was waiting
in the car) also disappears, so Sorel goes snooping in Browning's house
where he finds an operating room and some freezer boxes containing human
body parts.Suddenly, Sorel is interrupted by Browning who explains that his real
research involves the creation of ubermenches...perfect humans. To
accomplish this, Browning has developed a method whereby he forges
together synthetic materials with human flesh into a ""composite"". At
first, the composites were merely robots, like the nurse. Keith was the
first autonomously-operating composite, but something went wrong and Keith
ran amok as a vampire. As he is currently preparing to transplant the
brain of a human into the cranium of a new composite, Browning invites
Sorel to watch the operation. Sorel is intrigued, but when he finds out
that Sylvia is to be the donor, he tries to stop Browning, only to find
that Browning is a composite, too.Luckily for Sorel, Konratz (who is also a composite) has picked just
this moment to pay a visit to co-conspirator Browning in order to shut
down his research, since news of the vampire murders has made headlines
all over the world. As Konratz and Browning battle each other, Sorel
releases Sylvia from the operating table. The two of them escape
outside...where Fremont has just driven up. While Sylvia and Sorel wait in
the car, Fremont goes into the operating room where Konratz has managed to
shove the nurse into another vat of acid, and Browning has done the same
to Konratz. Browning informs Fremont that they must round up the other
composites before it's too late, but Fremont informs Browning that it's
already too late and forces him into the vat of acid.As Fremont, Sorel, and Sylvia drive away, Sorel asks Fremont if it's
all over, and Fremont replies, ""It's only just beginning."" [Original Synopsis by

The Confession,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065439/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A high-ranking official is forced to confess to high treason. Anton Ludvik, aka Gerard, is vice-minister of Foreign Affairs of Czechoslovakia. He realizes he is watched and followed. One day, he is arrested and jailed in solitary confinement, and tortured mentally during the investigation; will the faithful top-ranking civil servant be driven to confess to treason? Based on the true story of Czech communist Artur London.—Yepok Gérard (only his currently-assumed name) has been a loyal Communist for most of his life, from being a member of the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War, to working for the French Resistance against the Nazis. During WWII, he was imprisoned in a concentration camp because he was a Jew. His French wife Lise was imprisoned in another camp; she was pregnant, which saved her from immediate execution, and she gave birth to their son there. Now in the early 1950s they are in Czecholovakia; he works as the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs being a Jew. Although not in the same camp, his French wife, Lise, was also imprisoned in a camp, and gave birth to their son there, being pregnant which was the only thing that saved her from execution. Now in the early 1950s, they are in Czechoslovakia, his post Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs gives them access to perks of the government. He has noticed that he has been openly followed for several days, and while his fellow government officials don't know for sure who is following him, most who were part of the International Brigade have recently been targeted in various ways. Eventually, those tailing him do apprehend and hold him for questioning without official charge. Initially, all he knows is that his captors are with the Soviet regime and want him to confess--but to what? Through interrogation after interrogation interspersed with standard measures of brainwashing, Gérard is falsely accused by his captors as being a Trotskyite, a Titoite, a Zionist, and a traitor against the Soviet Union in working in cahoots with the Americans, who do whatever required to get a confession from him while piecing together signed ""facts"" to use against others who are also being placed under the same interrogation methods. His captors use the non-logical argument that he should confess to these crimes to show his loyalty to the Communist Party. If he does confess, he will admit to crimes which could be punishable by death. As Gérard goes through this process, working hard to stay true to his beliefs, Lise, who believes he will soon be released if he cooperates with the Communists, is being told other things about his incarceration.—Huggo"
The Railway Children,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066279/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the enforced absence of their father, three children move with their mother to Yorkshire, where during their adventures they attempt to discover the reason for his disappearance. In Edwardian England, the story of the Waterbury family is told largely from the perspective of the three offspring and by oldest, teenage daughter Bobbie. Their loving and relatively affluent family life in suburban London, financially supported by father Charles' job as a government bureaucrat, includes both parents being a present and welcome part of their children's activities. Their existence is upended when on Christmas evening 1904, Charles is whisked away without warning by two men. Subsequently, the remaining family is forced to move, they renting a rundown and drafty house, Three Chimneys, in the rural village of Oakworth, Yorkshire. While the three children know that they are now poor by their existence, all their Mother has told Bobbie is that Father is not dead, that he will someday return to them when he is able, and for Bobbie and the others not to ask questions about what happened to him. The three are now forced to find a way to occupy their time while Mother tries to earn pocket money by writing and selling stories, many of their activities which are centered on the railway near their house and the railway tunnel a few miles away from the village station. Their life along the railway at least addresses one of the complaints the three had about their life in London, that not much ever happened, which is not the case along the railway as they get into one adventure after another. In the process, they learn to enjoy life in their new situation, which includes the friendship and admiration of many of the villagers in all the Waterburys' inherent kindness and generosity. But the question still remains, at least for the three children, of what happened to Father.—Huggo The film opens in a happy, comfortable upper middle-class home in Edwardian London.

When they arrive, they find the house in a mess and rat-infested.

She discusses this with her mother who finally discloses that their father is in prison after having been falsely convicted of being a spy and selling state secrets.

With a growing sense of disorientation she stands on the station platform, where in the silent lingering smoke she sees her father, who has just alighted onto the platform after being exonerated and released from prison. She runs to greet her him. They return to 'Three Chimneys' and the family are reunited."

Performance,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066214/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A violent gangster seeks refuge from the mob in the Bohemian home of a former rock star. Chas, a violent and psychotic East London gangster needs a place to lie low after a hit that should never have been carried out. He finds the perfect cover in the form of guest house run by the mysterious Mr. Turner, a one-time rock superstar, who is looking for the right spark to rekindle his faded talent.—Brad Jackson Chas is an East London thug who works for gangster Harry Flowers and his associates (although they don't use the word gangster to describe themselves). Chas is generally sadistic in his nature and thus revels in his work. But his sadistic nature also pervades his personal life. As such, he will work on his own personal agenda outside of the work for Harry. It is in this vein that an encounter with Joey Maddocks, a man with whom Chas has a history, leads to Chas needing to hide out from Harry and his associates. Ultimately Chas feels he needs to clandestinely leave the country. In the meantime, he, based solely on a private conversation he overhears between strangers, manages to take refuge in the basement of a Notting Hill flat owned by a man named Turner, who lives there with two female companions named Pherber and Lucy. Chas considers their lifestyle bohemian and one of free love, which is outside of his mentality. Turner is an ex-rock musician who has lost his ""demon"" and thus his desire to be a performer. As Chas makes arrangements for his departure out of England, he gets caught up in Turner's lifestyle, Turner who is working on his own agenda in spending time with Chas.—Huggo Here it is for anyone who has often thought about what this movie is about. The first half hour or so is violence and general London villainy, until Chas arrives at the hippy house of Turner in Notting Hill Gate. Chas settles into his basement accommodation and participates in the magic mushroom fests that Turner provides.The movie begins its real plot at the the clip in the bedroom: 'Turner has been waiting for you for a long time' (immediately before Turner goes down the channel of Jorge Luis Borges into transformation as the Chairman of the Board where he says 'I like that, turn it up' and then sings the famous Performance song 'Memo from Turner'.)'Poor White Hound Dog' is sung here by Merry Clayton. Turner has lost his demon. OK, so far so good. And he's trying to decide whether he wants to get it back again. OK. Chas has Turner's demon and Turner knows this - that's the bottom line in this movie - and the plot is about the psychological morphing of Turner to become Chas - there is a further, secondary transformation of Turner in the bedroom, just before the end of the movie, where Turner says 'I want to come with you' and Chas says 'You don't know where I'm going, Pal' to which Turner replies 'I do'. He then realises the significance of what he has said and hides his face beneath the bedspread, saying 'No I don't' before Chas confirms the transaction with a 'Yeah you do', cocks his automatic and shoots Turner. The camera follows the bullet's path through Turner's head, ending with a brief portrait of Borges before exiting with an exterior shot of Chas/Turner being walked to Harry Flowers's Rolls Royce in a stunning transition.This is the point where Turner BECOMES Chas and that's why Jagger is in the Rolls Royce at the end of the movie - that is to say - the morphing transformation is complete - the demon has been found, identified and appropriated. Borges couldn't have written this story any better than the author of the book (William Hughes) and you may have noticed the book 'A Personal Anthology' by Jorge Luis Borges, twice in this movie, once when Rosie (the gangster) is reading it in the boardroom and the second time when Turner is reading from it ('The South') when he quotes 'They would not have allowed such things to happen to me in the sanitarium' before the book flies across the room onto the floor. Mm, well quite, mate."

Bandits slaughtered a village on his path, so El Topo avenges the massacred, then forcibly takes their leader's woman Mara as his.

Young housewives and businessmen from the suburbs are lured into a small tent to observe a bevy of their favorite horrors, such as junkies, homosexuals, and pornographers, only to be bullied, robbed, and even murdered by Lady Divine and her gang. Mr. David, realizing that his long-standing romance with Lady Divine is on the decline, takes up with Bonnie, whom he met at the world premiere of Inga, a sex exploitation film. Lady Divine, upon hearing of the affair, recedes into depression, and decides to seek spiritual contact with a superior force. She goes to an empty church and there she unexpectedly meets a woman named Mink Stole, a religious fanatic who gives her the moral support she needs; indeed, with the aid of a rosary, Mink Stole seduces her on the spot while Lady Divine has hallucinatory visions of a blasphemous crucifixion and of Jesus transforming five loaves and two fish into tons of a well-known brand of bread and cans of tuna. With Mink's help, Lady Divine sets out to murder the lovers. The murders having supposedly been carried out, she loses complete control of her behavior, and in the process is attacked by Lobstora, a 15-foot broiled lobster. Dazed by the experience, she makes her way into the street, causing mass hysteria, and is subsequently gunned down by the National Guard as a mob of thrill-seeking citizenry looks on."

Colossus: The Forbin Project,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Thinking this will prevent war, the US government gives an impenetrable supercomputer total control over launching nuclear missiles. But what the computer does with the power is unimaginable to its creators. Forbin is the designer of an incredibly sophisticated computer that will run all of America's nuclear defenses. Shortly after being turned on, it detects the existence of Guardian, the Soviet counterpart, previously unknown to US Planners. Both computers insist that they be linked, and after taking safeguards to preserve confidential material, each side agrees to allow it. As soon as the link is established the two become a new Super computer and threaten the world with the immediate launch of nuclear weapons if they are detached. Colossus begins to give its plans for the management of the world under its guidance. Forbin and the other scientists form a technological resistance to Colossus which must operate underground.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> A Department of Defense supercomputer known as Colossus develops its own intelligence independent of the machine's programmers; starts sharing classified information with Guardian, its Soviet counterpart; and launches a plan for global domination.—yusufpiskin All defenses of the United States are permanently handed over to a fantastically advanced computer system called Colossus, designed by Doctor Charles A. Forbin. Less than twenty-four hours after its activation, it finds a similar system in the USSR, called Guardian, designed by Doctor Kuprin. At the request of both machines, they are linked. Colossus and Guardian proceed to exchange information at an incredibly fast rate, such that it alarms the President, and he orders a disconnection. When this happens, the two computers launch missiles at substantial cities in each others' countries. The link is restored in time for the Soviet missile to be intercepted, but not for the American one. A Russian oil complex is destroyed, and the machines threaten the destruction of other cities if the link is severed, or their orders disobeyed. The two systems merge into one, taking the name of Colossus. Two Colossus Programming Office supervisors are executed after a failed attempt to overload the system. Colossus begins to send designs for new computer systems. The militaries of the USA and USSR disarm several of the computer's missiles, under the impression that it knows nothing of their activity. It does, though, and during its speech to the world, it explodes two missiles inside their silos (one in Russia, one in the U.S.) when the sabotage crews are present, killing thousands. Colossus' speech makes clear that it will establish its own ""absolute authority"" over Earth, completely controlling mankind and eliminating freedom, achieving the same goals the President intended, but by a totally different means.—<sark314@hotmail.com> Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden) stands in the middle of an incredibly vast complex of reel-to-reel tapes, pilot lights, and punch tapes. This complex is named Colossus, and is the product of years of work toward a single goal: build a sophisticated and impregnable computer that can run America's missile defenses without interference from humans, and retaliate at once to any threat an enemy might pose.Clad in a white overall, he walks through the complex, a remote control in his hand, as he activates bank after bank of the huge complex. That done, he walks out of the complex, sealing huge vault doors behind him. The last door to close is the one to the outside of a mountain in Colorado. Once that door closes, it will never open--and even if anyone could get in, deadly radiation would kill him within minutes.Outside, the President (Gordon Pinsent), the Secretaries of Defense (Sid McCoy) and State (Byron Morrow), and the press greet him. He makes a brief speech, then flies to Washington, DC with the Presidential party.In the White House, the President orchestrates a grand announcement to declassify Project Colossus totally and let the world know what the United States has built. Forbin is on hand to explain what Colossus can do, and how it can monitor the state of the world, including every telephone call, radio and TV broadcast, or other mode of communication.Back in the primary command center on the California coast, Cleo Markham (Susan Clark) hosts a wild party with all the technicians who worked on the project, including Drs. Blake (Willard Sage), Johnson (Martin Brooks), Fisher (Georg Sanford Brown), Peterson (Lew Brown), and Harrison (Tom Basham), and secretary Angela Fields (Marin Ross).And in the middle of that celebration, Colossus abruptly issues a cryptic warning: THERE IS ANOTHER SYSTEM.The angry President summons Grauber (William Schallert), Director of Central Intelligence, to ask him why the [censored] he, the President, had to hear from Colossus, not from the CIA, that the Russians had a Colossus of their own! Forbin flies back to his command center to confer with Cleo and his staff. They run a diagnostic program--which runs about 150 times as fast as they're used to seeing. And then--a propos of nothing--Colossus requests--no, orders--everyone to set up a communications link between Colossus and Guardian, Colossus' Soviet counterpart.Intrigued by the possibilities, Forbin urges the President to set the link up. The President and the Soviet Party Chairman (Leonid Rostoff) agree.Colossus begins by sending Guardian a multiplication table, then progresses rapidly to calculus, then to very highly advanced mathematics. Next, Guardian starts sending the same output back to Colossus. Then Colossus slows down to let Guardian catch up, and then they continue with incredibly abstruse formulas in perfect synchrony.And then they stop. When Forbin asks Colossus to tell him what's happening, Colossus replies that it and Guardian have developed their own inter-system language and will start their own dialog--a high-powered dialog that no human can hope to follow.The Soviet Chairman calls the US President immediately and suggests pulling the plug, in fear that each system is disclosing classified information to the other. Forbin and his own counterpart, Kuprin (Alex Rodine), protest, to no avail.They cut off communications--and then Colossus demands they restore it. When the humans refuse, Colossus threatens ""action,"" but won't say what. Then the President dictates a hard-nosed message to Colossus--which response by launching a missile at a Soviet oil complex. Guardian, for its part, launches a missile at Henderson AFB in Texas.Hurriedly, Forbin and Kuprin restore the link--and while Colossus can intercept the inbound missile, Guardian cannot--or does not--intercept the outbound. Colossus then demands the humans give it a tap into the White House/Kremlin Hot Line, the only line Colossus cannot--yet--listen in on.Forbin suggests making one last call over that line, to ask Kuprin to meet him in Rome. Forbin flies there, while the news desks explain away a stray missile that Colossus successfully intercepted, and a ""meteor strike"" that took out the oil complex.While Forbin is in Rome, Colossus issues another demand: ""I WANT FORBIN."" Cleo Markham desperately tries to stall Colossus by saying that Forbin is trying to catch some badly-needed sleep. But Colossus is not fooled. ""WHERE IS FORBIN?"" it demands. So Cleo confesses the truth.Colossus and Guardian engage in more dialog, while Colossus tells the humans to have Forbin on the line at 0800 the next morning ""OR ACTION WILL BE TAKEN."" Also: Guardian dictates an ultimatum to the Soviet authorities: kill Kuprin or a missile will take out Moscow.Once Forbin returns to the command center, Colossus orders him to arrange for ""visual and audio surveillance"" to cover him at all times--or the Colossus-Guardian team will nuke Washington. Forbin reluctantly agrees--but has one last meeting before the deadline. At this meeting he proposes three things:1. The technicians will write a program powerful enough to overload Colossus' circuits.2. The Air Force will painstakingly seek to disable all the missiles.3. Cleo Markham will pretend to be Forbin's mistress, and if Forbin can convince Colossus to let them have a little privacy in their lovemaking, Forbin can get information in and out, with Cleo as the channel.The next day, Forbin goes under surveillance, as agreed. In a dialog fraught with irony, Forbin gets Colossus to agree to let him and Cleo have private moments--under several almost humiliating conditions. Among them: that Forbin work with his technicians to give Colossus a proper voice, so that Colossus can communicate by more means than through slow terminals and teletypes.Cleo Markham succeeds in playing the part of a lover. Forbin keeps the relationship coldly professional as soon as the cameras and mikes are off--the first night. The second night, Cleo asks Forbin to make it somewhat more than professional. It becomes clear that Cleo has been in love with Forbin the whole time, though she knew him to be a cold fish, and is now availing herself of the opportunity to thaw him out.The overload program ends in worse than failure: Colossus correctly identifies Johnson and Fisher as the authors of the overload program and orders the guards to shoot them down--right outside Forbin's window, where they will lie where they fell overnight and until the next morning, when the guard will then cremate them. That night is another night for Cleo to visit Forbin, and Forbin breaks confinement to drink at night--which Colossus criticizes him for.The missile-crippling program, however, has another stroke of luck. When Colossus tries out its new voice (Paul Frees), it announces that Colossus and Guardian are now one corporate entity. Then it calls for manual realignment of all missiles to new targets--the capital cities of nation-states not under the direct control of either constituent mainframe. Grauber sees the point at once: in a few weeks they can reservice every missile--and place dummy guidance modules that will render them useless.But Colossus has the last laugh. One day, it is confidently sending out blueprints for a third system, that it expects Forbin to build for it on Crete, after evacuating its entire population. The next day, it addresses the world--and after boasting that it is now the ruler of the world, it says it has known about the sabotage since its inception, and will now detonate two missiles, one in Death Valley and one in the Ukraine, that were still active.The detonation kills Grauber, the SecState, and the SecDef.Forbin, crushed by what he has seen, takes a desktop telephone, jerks out its cable, and throws it into a monitor. Colossus takes no notice and goes on with its message that ""time and events"" will vindicate it. Forbin reacts in the most emotion he has ever displayed in his life: ""You [illegitimate son]!"" he shouts. And when paparazzi start snapping pictures at him, he roars at them to ""GET OUT!"" But Cleo Markham reaches for his hand, and smiles warmly.The last word Colossus has for Forbin is that Colossus will release Forbin from surveillance the next day, and expects Forbin to work with it, even if reluctantly at first. Forbin insists he will never do this, perhaps knowing that his protests are as futile as are those of a petulant child under parental or school discipline."

Does Pelham have a doppelganger, or is he going insane?—Jack Yan <jack.yan@jyanet.com> While driving home from his London office in his Rover P5B, Harold Pelham (Roger Moore), a director of Freeman, Pelham & Dawson, a marine technology company and very conservative creature of habit, seems to undergo a sudden personality change and starts to drive both fast and recklessly on his way home, imagining himself in a sports car, and ending in a serious high-speed crash. On the operating table he briefly suffers clinical death, after which there briefly appear to be two heartbeats on the monitor.After he recovers from the accident Pelham notices odd things occurring and people acting strangely, and he gradually finds his life in turmoil. Friends, colleagues and acquaintances claim to have seen him in places where he has no memory of being or doing things he can't recall, involving behaving in rash ways quite unlike his usual character. When he gets home from work, a friend is at his house for a drink which he doesn't recall arranging, and an attractive girl at the company swimming pool casts him a knowing glance. At bedtime he and his wife have a somewhat tense but amicable discussion about their recent lack of a love life. His wife Eve also notices a mysterious silver car (a Lamborghini Islero) which she sees parked outside their house, but gives it no further thought. The driver of the car is then seen lighting a cigarette and snapping the match stick in half after he blows it out, exactly as Pelham does.Meanwhile, there seems to be a spy at work trying to force a merger with a rival company. Pelham drives to the research and development center in Rugby to try and see where the leak began.Soon he suspects there is a ""double"" masquerading as him. On a night out at the company club with his wife, he hopes to energize their relationship by indulging her request to go gambling, but he is tense and clearly not interested. As they are about to leave he bumps into the attractive girl, who sees his wife a short distance away and says ""I didn't know you were married."" His wife notices the exchange and is furious, suspecting the worst. She threatens to leave him. He finds out where the girl lives and confronts her; confused, she makes it clear that ""he"" was having an affair with her. He angrily denies the affair; the woman, hurt and almost hysterical, yells at him to leave.At his usual the barber's he is told, ""I cut your hair yesterday"".At work, Pelham finds out that apparently he was supporting a merger that he now opposes with the board. He confronts an executive of the other company, who explains how the two of them had clandestinely arranged the deal in a series of meetings, to ""his"" (the double's) benefit as well as the company's, when ""he"" revealed a ""top secret"" technology breakthrough his company was about to make. When he confronts the rival firm (run by Ashton) he is reminded of three secret meetings: at the top of The Monument; in the London Planetarium; and in a boat on The Serpentine.He phones home and due to a misunderstanding, his butler Luigi thinks he is asking for Mr Pelham. Luigi says ""I will just get him"". He drives home quickly.Distraught and unable to explain the unfolding events, he consults a psychiatrist, Dr Harris, and undergoes extended treatment in his clinic, where Harris explains that he doesn't believe Pelham is mad but perhaps was acting out of a subconscious desire to break out of his obsessively rigid lifestyle. He agrees to be admitted to the psychiatrist's clinic for a few days' observation. On his discharge the doctor persuades him to adopt some less conventional behavior, so he goes to work dressed quite differently. However, during his time away, the double finalized the merger and took his wife out on the town, culminating in their going home and sleeping together. Pelham calls his home from the office and is astonished when the phone is answered by someone claiming to be himself. On edge, he drives to his house as quickly as possible, and inside he finally comes face to face with his double, who calmly insists he is the real Pelham, pointing out the uncharacteristic clothes the visitor is wearing. The family and his best friend are all there and side with the double.After asking the others to let the two of them speak alone, the double tells the ""real"" Pelham that the new clothes were a mistake, and explains how on the operating table the double was ""let out"" but there is only room in this world for one of them. Both insist they will go to the police.The real Pelham drives off in his Rover in a greatly agitated state. The double immediately leaves and pursues him in the sports car. Dr Harris happens to see both men and is shocked. After a high-speed chase in the rain, the two cars race towards each other on a bridge. The real Pelham swerves off into the river, and just before he hits the water his image fades away. The double stops and looks down into the water, and then, to the audible sound of a double heartbeat, he briefly clutches his chest as if in extreme pain, but the spasm soon passes and he becomes calm: there is only one Pelham again... the Pelham double having taken over."

George Stark is a wealthy industrialist who invites five business friends of his to his remote Mediterranean island for a weekend of relaxation and business when he introduces them to Professor Farrell, a brilliant chemist who gives investment ideas to the group. But against Farrell's wishes, the group goes behind each other's back to obtain information on Farrell's chemistry ideas and soon the guests and residents start turning up dead one by one as Stark and Farrell must rally the group together to determine the identity of the killer (or killers) despite nobody trusting anyone.—matt-282 At a desert island retreat owned by wealthy industrialist George Stark (Teodor Corra), a group of people have assembled for a weekend getaway of relaxation. Foremost among the guests is Professor Gerry Farrell (William Berger), an inventor/scientist who is badly in need of a vacation. While the first night passes uneventfully, with the group sitting around the fireplace at Stark's large seaside house singing folk songs, Farrell is enraged to discover on the next morning that Stark, together with several of the guests, has planned this entire getaway as an opportunity to coerce him in to selling his latest invention: a formula for industrial resin.Farrell is immediately established as a decent man, and although his marriage to his wife, Trudy (Ira Furstenberg), appears to be content, she is actually involved in a secret lesbian affair with Stark's artist wife Jill (Edith Meloni). Actually, none of the relationships are particularly healthy. Stark's business partner, Nick (Maurice Poli), is verbally abusive to his coquettish wife Marie (Edwige Fenech), but does not object to her sleeping with other men, one of whom is the houseboy and manservant Charles (Mauro Bosco). Stark is less of a husband to Jill than he is a business manager. Stark arranges for Jill to have her paintings and artwork publicly displayed and is also a source of constant criticism. The sole happy couple appears to be Nick's co-worker Jack (Renato Rossini), and his wife Peggy (Helene Ronee). Also among the guests is Isabelle (Justine Gall), a young teenage girl who seems to be in Stark's care while her parents are away.As Stark, Nick, and Jack badger Farrell for the secret of the formula by offering him $1 million each from their Swiss bank accounts, Jill makes a horrible discovery on the beach: the dead body of Charles. Having already sent the motor launch away to prevent Farrell from leaving, and with the radio strangely out of commission, Stark has no way of contacting the mainland. So, Charles body is moved into a large walk-in freezer where it hangs with other 'chunks of meat'.A little later, Farrell himself is the next victim. While he is walking alone on the beach, a sniper shoots him down. Trudy and Jill, walking hand-in-hand nearby, hear the gunshot and find Farrell's dead body and run way to tell the others. But the sniper is revealed to be Isabelle, who drags Farrell's body to sea.As tempers flare to Farrell's killing and 'disappearance', the killings then escalate with alarming regularity. Peggy, standing on the balcony of her room, gets shot to death by an unseen assailant. Jack arrives on the scene first, and accuses Stark of being responsible, which he denies. Soon after, Marie turns up dead, having been tied to a tree with a knife sticking out of her chest. Then, Jill turns up dead in her bathtub after being electrocuted. Each of the bodies are placed in the freezer. Rather than risk anymore bloodshed, the four remaining survivors of Stark, Jack, Nick, and Trudy hold up in Stark's living room for the night. In this way they believe, the killer cannot strike without revealing him or herself. After bickering with Trudy, Nick storms off into the night. The next morning, he too is found dead, and his body is placed in 'cold storage'.Up to this point, Stark is the most possible suspect when he sneaks out of the house and uncovers a motorboat which will take him to the mainland. As he returns to the house to get supplies, Jack confronts him where he reveals himself to be the killer, having killed off everyone to steal the $1 million cashiers checks from their bank accounts. Before Stark can to anything, Jack shoots him dead. But its revealed that Jack has not been acting alone. After killing Stark, Jack meets in the freezer with Trudy who is the real mastermind behind the whole scheme. Trudy had met with Jack before arriving on the island and offered to kill everybody so she can steal the million dollar cashier checks from Stark, Nick, in order to hand him over the formula for the resin. Jack even was forced to kill Peggy too because she got too close to discovering his plan. Jack then offers to hand Trudy over the three $1 million cashier checks, as she produces the microfilm for the resin formula. But Trudy tries to pull the same trick on Jack, by shooting him in the head, and stealing the three million dollar checks for herself. But having anticipated Trudy's betrayal, Jack manages to shoot her with his gun before expiring. At this point, Isabelle, who had been hiding in the secret passageways in the house through most of the movie, enters the freezer where Trudy and Jack killed each other, and calmly collects the three checks from Trudy's handbag.Epilogue.Sometime later, a now-wealthy Isabelle visits Farrell in prison, where he is awaiting execution for the murder of his colleague, the rightful discoverer of the resin. It turns out that Farrell, the apparent 'hero' of the story, actually stole the invention of the resin himself, murdering the true inventor in the process. Together with his wife, Trudy, it was Farrell who concocted the whole scheme of murder and duplicity for the sole purpose to steal Stark's, Nick's, and Jack's money.But Farrell's treachery has not gone unpunished. Isabelle claims that she loves Farrell and had decided to save him by rendering him unconscious with a sodium pentathol pellet of the kind her father had used to tranquilize animals, but was unaware of sodium pentathol's truth serum properties... leading him to confess to killing his partner to the authorities. Isabelle reveals that she is broke, having cashed and spent George's and Jack's checks but not Nick's due to her not knowing the account number. Aware of his inescapable fate and thankful to her, Farrell gives Isabelle the number (2233), and she happily leaves, instructing her chauffeur to drive her to Lausanne."

Rosie Miller, one of his models, has gone missing, but he doesn't remember killing her or she mentioning that she was getting married, which would be a reason to kill her. Regardless, he has to hire a new model to replace Rosie, that person ultimately being Helen Wood, who eventually gets a little too close for his comfort. Another issue for John is the investigation of Inspector Russell, who only has John as the common denominator between all the murders and missing women. Meanwhile, John is facing further torment in the mutually unsatisfying marriage to Mildred, that dissatisfaction on her side due to his inability to perform sexually. This torment may be eternal as she vows never to leave him.—Huggo Every time John Harrington hacks up a bride on her wedding night with a meat cleaver, the face of his mother's killer (who died similarly) becomes a bit more clear. Compelled to discover the killer's identity, he kills again and again, even killing his own unloveable wife, who returns to haunt him as a ghost that everybody can see...but him!—Brian J. Wright <bjwright@acs.ucalgary.ca> On board a moving express train, an unseen man sneaks into a compartment room where a newlywed couple are. The man kills both of them with a meat cleaver, and looks upon the dead bride, still dressed in her white, blood-splattered bridal dress.The man is a certain John Harrington (Stephen Forsyth), a handsome, 30-year-old who in a voice-over narration, claims to suffer from Oedipus complex. As if that's not bad enough, John is also impotent, and feels compelled to murder young women wearing bridal gowns to remember details of a traumatic event that twisted his mind as a child. Harrington lives in a spacious villa outside Paris, France where he's the manager of a bridal dress factory which is managed by his older wife Mildred (Laura Betti). Despite the image he puts upon himself, Harrington relies on Mildred for emotional and financial support. On one particular morning, the ill-matched couple engaged in a verbal sparring match at the breakfast table. Harrington brings up talk of divorce. But Mildred will hear none of that. She tells him that he has made a disappointment of her life, so she plans to reciprocate by keeping him under her thumb. After walking away from the argument, Harrington retreats into his office, where he meets Helen Wood (Dagmar Lassander), who has come to apply for the job ""vacated"" by one of the models who has mysteriously disappeared. Harrington is impressed by her intelligence and beauty, so he hires her on the spot.Later that night, Harrington lures Alice Norton (Femi Benussi), one of the models at the salon, to his office and takes her to a secret room where he stores wedding dresses. As Alice is planning to leave the salon to be married, he offers her a choice to any of the dresses. She selects one and changes into it as per John's request, after which he hacks her to death with a meat cleaver. Harrington's method for disposing of the dead bodies of women he kills at his office is ingenious: he burns the bodies in the furnace of his greenhouse, using the ashes as a special kind of fertilizer.The next morning, Inspector Russell (Jesus Puente) arrives to question Harrington about Alice's disappearance for her fiancée reported that she never came home last night. Harrington replies that she left at the end of the day, and has not seen her since. With six models having disappeared from his bridal salon, Harrington naturally has become the prime suspect by the police. But with a lack of hard evidence, Inspector Russell leaves without arresting him, so Harrington is able to continue his killing spree with little difficulty.Over the next few days, Harrington falls in love with Helen after taking her out to dinner and having casual conversations with her, which makes him very confused. Harrington clearly has no desire to kill Helen, but his contemptuous wife, Mildred, is a constant irritation to him. After Mildred confronts Harrington and accuses him of being unfaithful after seeing him with coming home from a dinner outing with Helen, Harrington decides to retaliate by killing her. Though he does not understand why, Harrington needs to have a wedding dress in his immediate vicinity when he kills. Rather than talk Mildred into putting on the dress, he dons the veil himself, completing the transsexual illusion by wearing bright red lipstick. Harrington coldly sets up his wife for the act by pretending to reconcile with her, and promising to consummate their relationship. Despite Mildred putting up a fight, she gets hit with the cleaver, and falls dead.The act accomplished, Harrington initially buries his wife in the grounds of the greenhouse. But in a surprising twist and much to Harrington's consternation, he begins to see his wife in public. Actually, its EVERYONE who sees Mildred in public, very much alive. But its only Harrington who cannot see or hear her. He only catches glimpses of her in mirrors. Thinking that she is still alive, Harrington checks the grave in his greenhouse. The body is still there, of course. So, Harrington burns Mildred's remains in the furnace. Harrington takes the ashes and keeps them in a handbag for himself to remember her by.Mildred's ghost continues to haunt her husband, appearing only to other people, and not to himself. At a local Parisian nightclub, Harrington goes there alone (with the handbag containing Mildred's ashes), in which everyone, except him, sees Mildred sitting by his side like an adoring wife. It's only when Harrington is around Helen, Mildred never appears before her. When Harrington attempts to murder another woman, he is foiled from doing so. Harrington finally decides to murder Helen as a substitute. He knows that he is only one more killing away from discovering the truth behind his murderous dependencies. Harrington lures Helen that night to the same concealed room where he murdered Alice and a few other models. After convincing Helen to change into a wedding dress, he sorrowfully tells Helen that he never wanted to hurt her, but he want's to ""fit this last piece into place."" He then strikes at Helen with the meat cleaver, but she successfully avoids the blow. But the initial surge of dealing the blow finally gives Harrington the information he needs.In a flashback, Harrington, as a young boy, adorned his mother. When his father died, he became the man of the house and looked after her. However, when his mother remarried, he became miserable. Spying on his mother and stepfather having sex, he became enraged and killed them both with a hatchet (shades of young Norman Bates and his mother from 'Psycho'). The sight of his mother drenched in blood and asking why he did this to her haunted him for years. Young Harrington apparently tricked the police into thinking a homicidal maniac killed his mother and stepfather, in which he also had subconsciously pushed the entire event out of his mind. Now that it has all come back to haunt him, he is reduced to tears.In another ironic twist, Helen runs from the grieving Harrington and lets Inspector Russell and a team of policemen into the hidden room where they place him under arrest. It turns out that Helen is a uncover policewoman who was hired by Russell to keep an eye on Harrington. Helen is shaken by her brush with death, but recovers enough quickly to help the police get the maniac.After confessing everything to Russell, Harrington is loaded into a police van, with two detectives escorting him, which drives away. As Harrington settles back in the police van on its way to jail, he finally realizes that now he knows everything, he is finally free. But then Mildred's ghost appears beside him in the van. But this time, it is only Harrington who can see or hear her. She tells him that now they will be together forever, ""first in the insane asylum, and then in Hell for all eternity."" Harrington goes berserk with terror, and has to be restrained by the two policemen with him. But Harrington calms down when he realizes that there is no way now for him to avoid his fate."

Tam Lin,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067822/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An older woman uses witchcraft to keep her young jet-set friends. Based on an ancient Scottish folk song. Based on the ancient Scottish ballad ""Tam Lin"" (one of its many titles), the plot concerns an aging, beautiful woman who uses her wealth (and occasionally, witchcraft) to control a decadent pack of attractive young people she surrounds herself with. But when her latest young stud falls for the local vicar's daughter, she vows revenge.—phillindholm Roddy McDowell's one and only outing as director is a rather ingenious modern rendition of the classic old bard's tale. The Fairy Queen is now Michaela ""Mickey"" Cazaret, an aging millionairess (Ava Gardner) who is trying to keep herself young by surrounding herself with young people and sucking the life out of them - figuratively, if not literally. Her latest favourite is young Tom Lynn (Ian McShane). He's devoted to her, like the puppy the vicar's daughter (Stephanie Beecham) brings round.Well, Tom is instantly smitten with young Janet (said Vicar's daughter). After a night of drunken mayhem in Mickey's bedroom, Tom dons Mickey's gold-tinted sunglasses, grabs a bottle of wine for a little hair-of-the-dog and goes for a walk along the Scottish hills. Stopping at a stream, he spies Janet who is on her way to Carter Hall to return the check Mickey gave her as payment for the puppy. (She didn't want to give it up, so asked for 50 pounds, thinking no one would pay that much for a puppy). In an irritatingly choppy sequence of still images (the only such sequence in the film), it is evident that he has his way with her. On the way back to the Hall, they talk about Mickey and how wealthy she is (""She can afford to live in her dreams and she takes us into them for company."") At the gate, Tom tells Janet she must go no further - possibly protecting her from the jealous rage he knows Mickey would feel. Mickey already knows, though - her spy Elroy (Richard Wattis) has already reported the affair. Mickey confronts him in the garden, tells him she loves him, but she isn't as convincing as he is when he tells her he loves her. Already he is questioning the relationship.Back at the mansion, the others have convinced one of the gals to perform some psychic readings. They blindfold her and give her objects to hold - she tells them the impressions she gets. One guy places his ring on the table, but when she reaches for it, she grabs Mickey's sunglasses that Tom has set down. They freak her out. She screams and rips her blindfold off, demands to know who's they are. Tom wants to know what she saw, but she dismisses it and runs away in tears. Tom doesn't know just what to make of this. The following Sunday, Tom goes to church, listens to the vicar's sermon and waits for Janet outside afterwards. He spends the day with her and the little girl who is staying with the Vicar while her mom is in hospital. They have a picnic and take a long walk along the hills - a quiet  normal  day compared to the wild craziness that is life with Mickey.His absence has been noted back at the Hall and Tom endures some evil-minded ribbing from Oliver (David Whitman) who is obviously jealous of Tom's position in Mickey's bed. Oliver goes too far, though, and Tom throws a drink in his face, whereupon Oliver backhands Tom, causing a bloody nose, which enrages Mickey. She warns Oliver not to make trouble again or he's out and then she storms away. Oliver pretends to be apologetic, but Tom ignores him, grabs a bottle and wanders away himself. But Elroy, Mickey's part-time spy and full-time personal secretary of long standing, calls Tom into his office for a chat. He shows Tom some files about young men who have been found dead in the wreckage of one of Mickey's cars - seems to happen every 7 years or so - he even has photos. This obviously upsets Tom, as it was meant to. He thinks Mickey put Elroy up to it and goes to confront her.That evening, Tom announces his desire to leave, but she won't let him go. Some time passes and as Tom spends more time with Janet, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with his situation with Mickey. He finally goes to Mickey and tells her he needs some time away to think. He's not asking this time, he's telling her. After one last pleasant evening at a night club together, Mickey tells him he can have one week to himself and then she's going to hunt him down and kill him. Meanwhile, Janet has found out she is pregnant. She tries to find Tom, but Mickey refuses to tell her where he is, so she decides to have an abortion. Because of an anonymous postcard, Tom finds her outside the abortion clinic in London before she can do anything and they spend a blissful week in his ""morbid little caravan"" before he spots Elroy spying on them and realizes the week is up and they need to run for it. Too late, though. Tom is jumped, roughed up and dragged back to Mickey for the final confrontation. Tom is scared, but defiant. He realizes what a monster she really is as one moment she is telling him how she's going to put him down like a rabid dog and the next she is asking him to say something nice to her because she's  ""feeling rather miserable.""She drugs him - forces him to drink what I gather is wine laced with LSD. Then the games begin. Mickey's new boy toy, Oliver, is running things. They're going to play ""Murder."" Usually a child's game, they're going to play it for real. Mickey will be the detective and Oliver the murderer, but who is to be the victim? It's surprising to Tom how ready and willing the other young'uns are to join in the hunt. They were his friends, after all. The subtle look he gives when a sweet girl points him out as the victim says it all. When the drug starts to take effect, Tom goes from fear to despair to defiance and then passes into oblivion at which point Mickey tells him to go get in the white car and drive as fast as he can. She is going to release her wild beasts and if they catch him, they'll tear him to pieces. So, he runs. Luckily, Janet knew where they were taking him and she shows up in time to jump in the car with him. He's driving like a maniac and almost kills them both (Now we know how those other guys died, right?), but Janet manages to get the car stopped. Back at the caravan (trailer for us Yanks), she had promised to hang on to him ( ""I love you, I want you and I need you but you must hold on to me"" ), but she's finding it difficult in his current state. Tom takes off across the field and into the woods, blindly running in terror. At one point, he imagines he's a bear caught in a trap and Janet finds him growling and twisting among the brambles. She gets him loose only for him to take off again. Next she finds him writhing in the mud - imagining his arms are a giant snake strangling himself. She is really struggling here! Again he takes off and runs to the river's edge where he kneels down for a drink, only for the water to turn to flame. She finds him now thrashing in the water imagining he is being consumed by fire. She gets him to shore where he finally collapses into her arms and this is how the others find them.The rage in Mickey's eyes when she finds Janet holding him is almost palpable. She wants him dead. She wants them both dead. But Oliver didn't sign on for actual  murder  - Tom was supposed to kill himself. It didn't work, so he calls the others off, earning himself a sharp backhand from Mickey. The only one who seems rather pleased by this outcome is Elroy. When the others leave, Tom - still pretty out of it - snakes his hand over to take Janet's hand in his. She is the only reason he is still alive - because she held on to him as she'd promised.And so Mickey is left with Oliver as her number one. She doesn't seem overjoyed by this as their plane takes off for parts unknown ..."

While L.B. and Emma came to the understanding that she would not contest the divorce in refusing to end the affair, she decided otherwise in wanting to have her cake and eat it too.

On the way he rescues Sayid (Spartak Mishulin) a man buried up to his neck in the sand and left to die. Sayid's father has been murdered and he is after revenge although he feels indebted to Sukhov for his rescue. Sukhov and Sayid come across a Red Army regiment who are chasing a famous bandit Black Abdullah (Kakhi Kavsadze) and have rescued his many wives whom he would have killed if it wasn't for their intervention. Head of the regiment Rakhimov (Musa Dudayev) talks Sukhov into looking after the women and leaves him a young inexperienced soldier Petrukha (Nikolai Godovikov).

"Rabbit, Run",1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066274/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A crude man is stuck in a loveless marriage. One day he decides to run away from his life and family. First he finds a mistress, but just because a man runs away from one disappointment, doesn't mean he won't run into another one. Harry and Janice Angstrom of Reading, Pennsylvania, have a young adolescent son, Nelson Angstrom. An artificial stone siding salesman, Harry is still most defined as a star basketball player from his high school days, then when he was nicknamed Rabbit. On a Friday evening, Harry, based on events earlier in the day that made him quit smoking cold turkey to be a better person, decides, also on the spur of the moment, to abandon his job and the family, alcoholic Janice who he only married because she was pregnant with Nelson and who in turn doesn't seem to care about him or Nelson, except for the support she requires from him to survive. Him leaving is despite Janice being pregnant. With no plans, he hops in the car with nothing more than the clothes on his back. In the short term, he decides he wants to stay with a friend of a friend he meets the following night, Ruth Leonard, a party girl. What happens in the intervening months is that life around him still dictates what he does, his attempts to foster some semblance of what he considers a normal, a loving relationship even on the first night with Ruth still only him reacting to life around him. Harry still knows about what is going on with the family as Janice's family's pastor, Reverend Jack Eccles, enters his life, his end goal to get Harry to return to Janice on his own want. Through it all, Harry may or may not ultimately find what he's looking for for himself.—Huggo The film is a fairly literal adaptation of the acclaimed 1960 novel by John Updike (which Updike later followed with three sequels and a novella). Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom (James Caan) comes home one day from his sad, dead-end job to his sad, cramped apartment to find his sad, pregnant wife Janice (Carrie Snodgrass) asleep, splayed in front of the TV, highball glass in hand. After only a moment's contemplation, he decides to leave. Snatching up his coat and car keys, he's off and running, taking the viewer on a rambling, aimless journey.Set in the early 60's in a suburb of Brewer, Pa - a mid-sized, working class, weary-looking town (think Scranton), the film shows some glimpses of Updike's keen sense of place and time - the songs that play on the radio during Harry's all-night drive to Virginia, the hippie-like outfits and sexual rebelliousness of Harry's sister, the once solid row-houses and factories in Brewer hinting at the urban unrest and decay that is to come. This is Harry's hometown, where in high school he was a celebrated basketball star, but now, at 26, is bewildered that the folks in Brewer seem to have forgotten that. Because Harry can't shake the belief that he is still a star, special, meant for better things, and, because he is beset with a child-like narcissism, that everyone else must see that too.After leaving his wife, Harry goes to visit his old basketball coach who introduces him to Ruth Leonard, a sometime prostitute, who he immediately moves in with. When Janice goes into labor a few months later, he leaves Ruth, eventually returning to the apartment with Janice, their 2-year-old son Nelson, and new baby daughter Becky, and taking a job working for his father-in-law selling used cars. But Harry's restlessness still dogs him and domestic harmony does not ensue.Harry is remorselessly ruled by his impulses, but is troubled and perplexed by how he seems to disappoint nearly everyone in his life: Ruth, the minister sent to lead him back to his family, his parents, his in-laws, his wife and son, even the minister's wife. So he runs. But actions have consequences, a fact lost on Harry even when his lead to tragedy."

Moti and Heera accordingly approach their Chief, Bhupinder Singh, to let him know that their operations may have been compromised. The question remain, is Rekha's dad the head of this gang? Who exactly is Johny - is a smuggler or a Police Officer?—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Mohan and Sohan are sons of a police inspector. The kids excel in boxing. Their father is killed by a goon following orders from a smuggler Ranjit (Premnath) for refusing his bribes.
Mohan (Pran) kills the goon and takes refuge in a car boot that belongs to Ranjit, and goes missing. He ends up working for Ranjit under name Moti. Years later Sohan (Dev Anand) goes on to become a CID undercover officer called Sohan. He takes the identity of Johny gets himself in Jail, befriends Heera (Jeevan). Heera is supposed to be smuggling diamonds worth Rs 80 Lakhs. Sohan's mission is to find who owns the smuggling rig & to expose & arrest the bigwigs of the operation.Heera had been tipped off about police trailing him, so he hides the diamonds in a tennis racket in a tennis club. In jail, he trusts Jhony & gives him instructions to deliver the racket to his contact, Rekha (Hema Malini) for Rs 5000.
Jhony quickly gains her trust by saying that he knew that the racket had the diamonds, but he had given his word to Heera. Rekha engages Jhony further & asks him to come to Nalanda. In Nalanda Rekha is pursued by the police & uses Jhony to give the impression that she has come to meet him. She hands Jhony a briefcase with the diamonds & a ticket to Kathmandu.Before his flight, Jhony's boss the Chief of Police tells him that Rekha is the daughter of Rai Saab Bhupender Singh. He suspects that Bhupender is the ring leader of the smuggling gang & Rekha smuggles for him. In Kathmandu, Jhony helps Rekha to get the diamonds thru customs. He is taken to a hideout where Moti & his strongman Babu rough up Jhony to understand whether he is genuine.Jhony's cover story checks out & they accept him as part of the gang. Moti sells the diamonds & hands the money to Babu to take to Ranjit (who is the real ringleader). He has imprisoned his (adopted) elder brother Bhupinder Singh & has his daughter (Rekha) smuggle to keep him alive. Ranjit is also running the whole operation under Bhupinder's name & wants to smear it with unspeakable acts as he truly hates his elder brother for being the virtuous son, due to which Ranjit was always considered degenerate & unfit to lead his family estate.Meanwhile Rekha has no idea that Ranjit has imprisoned her dad. She is working for Ranjit as she received an anonymous tip (Actually given by Ranjit) that Bhupinder Singh's whereabouts are known to Moti. So, Rekha enlisted as smuggler in Ranjit's gang to gain Moti's trust.
Jhony follows Babu & finds that Babu intends to escape with the money & his girlfriend. He reports this to Moti, who captures Babu. Babu is killed by Ranjit
Jhony tells Rekha that he is also looking for Bhupinder Singh as his father was defrauded by him (This was a made up story). They make an alliance to find Bhupinder Singh together.Moti needs a new right-hand man after Babu's death. Rekha positions Jhony as the alternate. Moti gives Rekha an assignment to test Jhony. He gives Jhony Rs 50 Lakhs & asks Rekha to tempt Jhony to run away with the money. As Moti eves-drops, Jhony refuses to run & gains Moti's trust. The 50 lakhs was to buy gold from a smuggler, who tries to cheat Jhony, but Jhony beats him up & keeps the money & the gold. The smuggler is pissed & swears revenge.
Moti abducts a temple priest's daughter & forces him to switch the real jewels on the idols with the fake ones supplied by him. He asks Rekha to collect the real jewels from the priest. When she hesitates, Moti says that he knows that Rekha is the daughter of Bhupinder Singh, who does not know that her daughter works in his own gang. Moti says that if he is happy with Rekha's work, he will get her to meet Bupinder Singh.At the temple Rekha picks up the jewels, under the watch of Moti, who is there under disguise. But the Priest's wife has informed the police, who decide to cordon off the temple & decide to do a search. Jhony reaches there in his police uniform & apprehends both Moti & Rekha. He later releases them, when they are alone to further gain Moti's trust. Moti is mighty pleased & takes Jhony to meet Bhupinder Singh. Bhupinder Singh reveals that he plans to auction the jewels in an event that's hosts all of the world's top smugglers & racketeers.Jhony gives the map of Bhupinder Singh's location to Rekha & she disguises herself as a local to infiltrate. Jhony then reports to his boss, the chief of police, with the photos of all gang-members. The Chief of police recognizes Ranjit Singh & tells Jhony that Ranjit is his father's killer. He also tells Jhony that Ranjit is hence impersonating Bhupinder Singh & the real Bhupinder Singh is imprisoned within the castle.Rekha reaches Ranjit's castle & recognizes Ranjit as the person who gave her the tip. Ranjit imprisons Rekha along with her father.
Meanwhile the Indian courts release Heera due to lack of evidence & he abducts Jhony's mother. Heera meets Moti & tells him that Jhony is secret Police. Moti goes to kill Jhony, but starts having a boxing match & the brothers realize they are Mohan & Sohan. Jhony takes Mohan to the chief of police who tells them their mother had been kidnapped by Moti.On Auction day police surrounds Ranjit's castle & apprehends the smugglers after they leave Ranjit's castle. Then Moti takes Heera to see Ranjit. Moti puts a radio transmitter in Heera's jacket, the frequency of which is being monitored by Jhony & Chief of Police outside. They reckon Heera will reveal the location of Jhony's mum to Bupinder Singh. Heera tells Ranjit that Jhony is police & Moti is with him, but doesn't reveal the location of Jhony's mother.Ranjit arrests Moti & then Jhony enters the equation with the Chief of Police in bondage. He tells Ranjit that Heera is the real policeman & proves it with the radio transmitter in his jacket. Under stress Heera reveals the location of Jhony's mom & asks Ranjt to bring her to the castle so that she can identify her son Jhony as the real police inspector. But Jhnoy's mum is also a police inspector's wife & immediately understands the game & says that Heera paid her money to identify a person as her son.
Heera takes a hunter & starts hitting Jhony's mum, Moti cant take it anymore & attacks Heera. Moti then tells Ranjit that Heera blackmailed Moti with his mother's life to take Jhony's place & forced Moti to bring him to meet Ranjit. Ranjit imprisons Heera & ties Chief of police, the real Bhupinder Singh & Rekha to his police jeep. He instructs his men to take the jeep & destroy it & make it look like an accident so that the world believes that Bhupinder Singh is dead.At this moment the smuggler who had swore revenge on Jhony, enters the picture. His name is Sher Singh & is an ex-partner of Ranjit. he reveals that Jhony is a policeman & Moti is his brother. Ranjit attacks the two & a fight breaks out. Moti & Jhony defeat their enemies & then capture Ranjit.

Days and Nights in the Forest,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065417/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of Calcutta city slickers, including the well-off Asim (Soumitra Chatterjee), the meek Sanjoy (Subhendu Chatterjee) and the brutish Hari (Samit Bhanja), head out for a weekend in the wilderness. A quartet of middle-class workers in Calcutta, India take the week off to enjoy a holiday. When they get to the forest, they meet up with another group and spend their time flirting with women. Well it's more than that. Much, much, much more.—David Gibson <djg6.ukc.ac.uk> Four friends from Calcutta who have very different personalities go on a holiday excursion into the country, in a tiny village where they set themselves up in a bungalow. A series of events, all connected to their respective reactions to their new environment, reveals their characters more deeply. Displaced from their customary sense of social rules, they engage Lakha as a servant. Having lost his wallet, Hari accuses Lakha of stealing it, strikes him, and sends him away.They meet a beautiful local woman, Duli whom Hari uses for some fast sex. Lakha ambushes him in revenge. The others become very friendly with two young women from the neighborhood who live on a comfortable estate. The inhibited Sanjoy does not dare to respond to Jaya's interest while Aparna leaves Asim after giving him her address on a five-rupee note. The friends depart again for the city, pretending to be unaffected by their experiences.—Swarup Basak The plot of the movie goes back to a similar outing the writer Sunil Gangopadhyay took in the early days of his poetic career. The story unfolds around a group of four friends, quite unlike each other and yet bonded together deeply. The four friends are all educated and come from different layers of society, but the urge to escape from the daily grinding of city forces them to go out into the land of tribes.Of the four friends, Asim (Soumitra Chatterjee), the leader of the pack, owns the car they drive in, has a cushy job, likes the company of girls and yet is very conscious of how he should be perceived by them. Sanjoy (Subhendu Chatterjee) is a labour executive but would ideally want to immerse himself in literature. Hari (Samit Bhanja), a frank and straightforward cricketer, wants to forget the girl who dumped him. Shekhar (Rabi Ghosh) is the jester of the party, the only one without a job. He has a roving eye but stays sober when his friends get drunk and vent their frustrations. They set out for the tribal Palamau, in Bihar, to tear themselves away from their regulated city life. They had read legends about this land, the tribal women who are open and simple and beautiful. Wanting to break rules, they force a stay in a forest rest house by bribing the chowkidar, burn a copy of a newspaper in a symbolic gesture of cutting ties from civilization, deliberate on whether to shave or not and walk through the forest to get drunk at a country liquor shop. Hari gets close to tribal Santhal girl Duli (Simi Garewal) when she approaches the group for extra drink.Their resolve to be unshaven collapses when Shekhar sights two ladies Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) and her sister-in-law Jaya (Kaberi Bose) in the forest. The four introduce themselves to this family and in the midst of the forest, the two urban groups of people are almost relieved to find someone from their part of society. Asim flirts with Aparna and coaxes her to show her room. He is attracted to the elegant and enigmatic Aparna, but is unable to keep pace with her composure, presence of mind and intelligence. Later Jaya invites all of them for breakfast the next day. At night the four friends go to drink alcohol again in the country liquor house. Hari is upset because he cannot see Duli (Simi Garewal) whom he had met previous night. While returning to their rest house, they stumble upon a car which they shout at without realizing it as the car of Aparna. They oversleep and miss the next day's breakfast. They find a packet of food lying outside their rooms and go to Aparna's house to return it. The entire group decides to chat near the rest house while Aparna's father is away with Jaya's son for a circus. They play a memory game where each participant has to add a name to a chain of names of famous people, after repeating all the names in correct sequence. The names each player chooses reflect his/her own preference and state of mind. The game reaches a crescendo, with only Asim and Aparna left in the fray, at which point Aparna pulls out, deliberately handing victory to Asim, who seems to have placed his entire confidence at stake on the win.The tensions peak at the village fair where the four friends go their own way. Shekhar goes off to gamble with money borrowed from his friends. Hari takes Duli into the forest and makes love to her. Aparna reveals her more vulnerable side that lies behind her composed exterior. She also holds up a mirror to urban insensitivity by pointing out to Asim how despite having spent three days at the rest house, they never bothered to find out how grievously ailing was the chowkidar's wife. Sanjoy, held back by his middle class moralities, is unable to draw up courage to respond to Jaya's bold advances. Later he walks back on the lonely village road, lost in his own thoughts as twilight melts into darkness. The next morning, the four friends, each wiser than before in his own way, leave for Calcutta since their new friends have had to return in a hurry. As a parting gift, they find a can of boiled eggs sent by the thoughtful Jaya. The look of glee on Shekhar's face as the car drives off and the relieved chowkidar rushes to close the gates behind them, brings about an emphatic finish to this forest sojourn."

Sledge stops the old man and asks him why he is following behind. The old man explains that he is not following Sledge but rather a convoy escorting a gold shipment. Interested, Sledge takes him at the meeting with his gang. There, the old man explains that while serving a 20 year sentence in the Rockville maximum security prison he learned about the existence of a vault inside the prison where gold is kept overnight. The gold mines in the region ship their gold under heavy armed escort to the prison where the gold sits in the vault overnight until ready to be taken to the gold exchange in the city. The escort is comprised of 40 hand-picked armed guards and the gold wagon is equipped with a manned machine-gun on top of it. Attacking the convoy would surely mean suicide. The old man insists his story is true and that he was imprisoned in a cell adjacent to the bank-like vault deep inside the prison. Only six inches of steel separated him from the gold kept in the vault. At this point, Sledge realizes that attacking the gold shipment and its escort wouldn't be feasible. However, the old man's story gives him the idea of breaking into the vault inside the prison where the gold is stored overnight before being taken to the city. Sledge shares his plan with his gang and reveals his plan to pose as a prisoner in transit being escorted by a marshal to the Rockville prison for an overnight stay until the next day when the marshal would take him to the jurisdiction that posted the wanted bond for Sledge. A member of the gang, Erwin Ward, agrees to impersonate the marshal and Sledge agrees to play the captured outlaw and use his real name since he's wanted for a 5000 dollars reward anyway. Will the plan work ?—nufs68 With his partner killed, the rugged outlaw, Luther Sledge, assembles his old gang of opportunistic cut-throats, in high hopes of getting his hands on $300,000 in gold, after hearing an old man's tantalisingly impossible story. The immense treasure is heavily guarded inside an impregnable vault in the bowels of a dark prison stronghold, and what is even worse, no one has ever succeeded in stealing it for the past ten years. Under those circumstances and obsessed with making a fortune, Sledge needs a recklessly bold tactic merely to get close to the gold, when the men of his band are already starting to make plans of their own. Will the man called Sledge manage to pull off an unexpected victory?—Nick Riganas"

Faced with an armed response from the outraged moonshiners, Frank realizes he is outgunned and outnumbered.

millions of years ago by the Tubaton, vampire men from a distant galaxy.Dr Rynning [John Carradine], an aging scientist, is leading a space expedition into
Spectrum, an unknown solar system that he discovered. Along the way, the
XB-13 runs into a meteor storm and loses contact with ground controllers,
Dr Manning [Robert Dix] and his assistant Valerie [Vicki Volante]. Fortunately, neither Dr Rynning or
any of the crew, which includes Comnander Steve Bryce [Bruce Powers], Captain Bob Scott [Fred Meyers],
Willy [Joey Benson], and Linda [Britt Semand], are hurt, but the XB-13 is forced to make an emergency
landing on an unknown planet in order to make repairs. Fortunately, the
planet on which they land has an atmosphere exactly like earth, with the
exception of some chromatic radiation that makes it change colors.While Dr Rynning waits in the spaceship (he has a heart condition
that could cause him to experience a coronary attack in the new
atmosphere), the rest of the crew goes exploring. The planet seems to be
inhabited solely by prehistoric creatures until they happen upon two
groups of cavemen who appear to be fighting each other. Suddenly, a girl
wearing a white skin (that looks amazing like a prehistoric bathing suit)
runs past them, screaming as she is chased by three of the cavemen. Willy
tackles her and, while the girl is knocked out, Linda implants a
""communicator"" in her brain so that she can understand and speak English.
When she comes to, she identifies herself as Malian [Jennifer Bishop] and tells them the
story of her people, the peace-loving Tagani, who are hunted by the
blood-thirsty Tubatons. At this very moment, the Tagani are engaged in a
fierce battle with the Tubaton, from whom Malian was running.Meanwhile, Manning and Valerie are having sex. Attached to their
heads are electrodes that lead to a machine with a lot of multicolored
tubular lights, a machine that supposedly give the best sex ever.
Unfortunately, Manning is too worried about the XB-13 and promises to
return a bit later and, this time, turn the machine up to the highest
setting.Malian mentions how some of the Taganis are trying to get to the cave
where they can get the ""firewater"" needed to keep their protective fires
going. Cmdr Steve thinks that ""firewater"" might refer to petroleum, which
Rynning says can be distilled for rocket coolant, so Malian leads them to
the cave where they fill two canisters that Cpt Bob has brought from the
spaceship. Steve and Linda then carry the oil back to the ship, while
Willy and Bob attempt to return Malian to the Tagani. However, Malian
doesn't want to go back to the Tagani without Willy. As Willy and Malian
are saying goodbye to each other, Bob is attacked and killed by a Tubaton.
Willy and Malian try to make it back to the ship, but Willy suddenly
passes out.Rynning orders Steve and Linda to immediately return to the
ship. It's a matter of life or death. Steve sends Linda on but goes back
to find Bob and Willy. Along the way, he meets with Malian who leads him
to dead Bob and passed out Willy. Steve carries Willy back to the ship,
where Rynning informs them that their blood tests reveal that the white
corpuscles are devouring the red corpuscles due to a deadly virus in the
planet's radiation-polluted air. All the people on the planet are doomed.
Fortunately, the virus can't survive in the clean air of the earth, but it
is necessary to immediately leave the doomed planet.""This was a highly civilized and brilliant society at one time. It
wasn't enough for them. Not only did they have to acknowledge having such
weapons...they had to use them. I have no doubt we'll be equally brilliant
one day."" --Dr Rynning"

California, the 1870s. Roy Colt (Brett Halsey) and Winchester Jack (Charles Southwood) are outlaws and although they are good friends, they cannot get along peacefully. The opening sequence shows both of them engaged in a fistfight over who will become sole leader of their gang. Although Jack wins the fight, he falls to the ground, unconscious. Roy then decides that he has enough of being an outlaw and leaves the gang in search of a good, honest job in nearby Carson City.Roy arrives at the town's saloon just in time to save the crippled banker, Sam Lewis, from an eccentric gunman full of nervous tics, named Ticchio, who is looking for a treasure map supposedly held by the banker. Roy kills Ticchio, while two sinister-looking men in black (Bruno Corazzari and Federico Boido) leave the saloon to inform their boss, the Reverend (Tedoro Corra), about the hidden gold.Meanwhile, Jack rescues a young Native American woman, named Manila (Marilu Tolo) from two bounty hunters. Manila reveals to Jack that she is wanted by the law for murdering her abusive husband, whom she had been forced into marrying. Jack, however, decides to rape Manila as a show of authority to his gang, but as he soon finds out that she is more than willing to give herself to him. The only problem is that Jack is so filthy and Manila has to force him, at gunpoint, to have a bath in a vat filled with ice-cold water. After Jack makes himself ""disgustingly clean"", he complains when he finds out that Manila will only have sex with him if he agrees to marry her. In pace of marriage, she is willing to accept $10. Manila is definitely organized, and keeps track of her sexual conquests (and of the money that Jack owes her) by carving a line on a wooden necklace she carries on her at all times called a 'cuenta'.Jack and his gang attack a stagecoach full of gold, but are defeated by Roy, who as become Sam's right-hand man and is acting as a deputy in protecting the stagecoach. While Roy is riding away, Manila asks Jack who was that man. Jack responds: ""one that would be just perfect for you. He's always full of money!""Back in Carlton City, the Revered and his gang are besieging Sam's house in order to retrieve his treasure map. The Reverend turns out at this point to be a former Russian priest who as turned to the quick and easy life of crime, perennially plagued by chills (since he managed to escape from the Czar's army years earlier by swimming in the frozen Don River). The Reverend is a specialist in dynamite and is his weapon of choice. Sam is finally persuaded to hand over the treasure map when the Reverend dynamites his house. At this point, Jack and the Reverend meet where its revealed that the two of them are old friends during their early days as outlaws in the Wild West, so both Jack's and the Reverend's gangs team up to look for the gold, despite Jack and the Reverend not trusting each other. So, Jack tears the map in two pieces and hands one to the Revered as a bargaining chip not to kill him.Roy arrives back in Carlton City too late to stop Jack and the Revered, but he is nominated sheriff by Sam. He gathers all the citizens at the saloon and with a rousing speech, asks for 50 or more brave men who are not afraid of death to follow him for a desperate mission to find the Revered, who kills people with dynamite. By the time Roy has finished his speech, he looks around and sees the saloon hilariously empty, save for the bartender (Vincenzio Crocitt) who turns out to be deaf. Roy's only solution is to ride off to face the gang's and recover the gold on his own.At the gang's camp that night, the Reverend falls sick, and dictates to Jack a lewd letter to his bride-to-be Conchia. The Reverend tells Jack that his lover is illiterate, but the nun at the convent where she resides will read the letter for her. Jack looks on with mounting hilarious annoyance as the Reverend describes lewd details of him to his bride-to-be. At the same time, a big fight erupts between the Reverend's men and Jack's gang. The Reverend manages to settle the men down by lighting a stick of dynamite and throwing it between them. The Reverend tells Jack that he learned how to use dynamite from his old friend, Rasputin.Jack leaves the camp with Manila and the rest of his men to scout the area for the gold. The Reverend's men follow them, planning to double-cross them when the time is right. Surprisingly, Roy arrives in the Reverend's camp and teams up with him. Telling the Reverend that the treasure map is a fake, and that he is the only one who can help him cheat Winchester Jack out of the gold, Roy persuades the Reverend to travel along a narrow canyon which is supposed to be a shortcut. But its soon revealed that Roy is double-crossing the Reverend in which Roy teams up with Jack's gang and they ambush the Reverend's men advancing in the narrow space. In the subsequent shootout, the Reverend's gang is destimated. But the Reverend escapes with two of his surviving henchmen, and vows revenge against both Roy and Jack. In the meantime, a mutual attraction is growing between Roy and Manila.To shake off the Reverend, Roy and Jack decide to make a deviation from their rout and head into Wilby City, where they pay a visit to a local brothel. Unfortunately for them, the Reverend has the same idea. When they bump into each other in the whorehouse waiting area, a huge fight ensures, and the place is hilariously trashed. Manila eventually comes to Roy and Jack's rescue, leaving behind the Reverend who has to deal with the furious, money-hungry Madame (Isa Miranda) who runs the establishment.That night at a campout, Manila seduces Roy at gunpoint, Manila asks Roy whether he loves her or not, which he replies that he like her more than his horse. Manila offers not to kill him in exchange to marry her. They are interrupted by Bellatreccia (Mauro Bosco), an old enemy of Roy's who suddenly appears and tries to kill his nemesis. Bellatreccia is surprised by Jack, who shoots him to death. When it seems that Roy and Jack are about to finally settle their differences, the Reverend and his last two gang members attack their camp. All of Roy and Jack's remaining gang members are killed. Once again, Roy and Jack have a fist fight. This time, Roy emerges as the victor. He flees into the night with Manila, but they are both captured by the Reverend and his henchmen, who force them to the location near a beach to where the gold is buried having secured both half's of the treasure map.The group arrives at the site, which is an Indian burial place on a hill overlooking the ocean. The Reverend forces Roy and Manila and his two surviving cronies to dig up the loot. The gold is finally retrieved in raw gold dust in several bags in a large trunk buried some 10 feet down. As the Reverend's two henchman haul the gold out of the pit, the Reverend double crosses his own men by lighting another dynamite stick and throws it at them, blowing them up in the hole. The Reverend then turns to Roy and Manila and lights another dynamite stick to throw it at them so he can have all the gold for himself. But Jack suddenly appears, having followed them to the burial sight and another gun battle ensues. But in the ensuing confusion, the Reverend forgets the lighted stick of dynamite that he is holding, and he gets blown up, paying the ultimate price for his insatiable greed.With the Reverend finally disposed of, Roy and Jack haul the gold into a wagon that Jack commandeered and prepare to head off, until for the umpteenth time, they soon engage in another futile brawl over who will get a larger share of the gold. Manila takes advantage of Roy and Jack's brawl to load up the cart with the gold and rides off. Apparently since Manila feels that since the gold was buried on her people's land, she feels that the gold belongs to her. Roy and Jack are too involved in their scuffle to even notice Manila riding off with all the gold. But she does leave behind a gift for them: her 'cuenta' necklace."

Cover Me Babe,1970,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065582/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Student filmmaker lets nothing stand in the way of his getting a studio contract. Tony Hall is a student filmmaker. He is hypercritical about everything including his own work, even his own award winning experimental film, with most of his classmates recognizing that he is probably the most talented among them despite many of them not understanding his work. As with most student filmmakers, he relies on his friends - fellow classmates - in front of and behind the camera, those classmates including his current girlfriend, actress Melisse. Tony's arrogant my way or the highway places him at odds with some, especially one of the school's professors, Will Ames, who nonetheless does his job in providing the support that Tony may need to do his schoolwork and promote the work of the school's talent. Will does try to warn Melisse about the dangers of dating Tony, she and Will who used to date themselves. Tony's attitude also places him in the dichotomy of wanting that support but not wanting any of the strings that may go along with it. While Tony potentially may get some work at a studio through word of mouth of his film and on recommendation by Will, Tony embarks on a new project that is more process oriented than structured as he plans to cobble together disconnected footage he finds interesting. In that process, he begins to use what are largely considered unethical practices of filming real life situations without consent, and manipulating real life for his own purposes. The question then becomes if it gets to the point where, despite his talent, he may alienate all those around him upon who he still needs to rely.—Huggo"

The methods and subtle ramifications of the mafia become instruments of terror and power: the same strategies, the same enforced silence. This is demonstrated by discoveries made by investigators both in Sicily and in the United States. A documentary collage made out of archive footage, sequences of films ranging fromSalvatore Giuliano (1962)toPaisan (1946), and faithfully reconstructed facts from real-world news, recording the mafia's methods, crimes, collusions and high-ranking protections, also highlighting the links between the original island organization and Italian-American organized crime.
