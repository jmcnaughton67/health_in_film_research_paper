Toy Story 3,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435761/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The toys are mistakenly delivered to a day-care center instead of the attic right before Andy leaves for college, and it's up to Woody to convince the other toys that they weren't abandoned and to return home. Woody, Buzz and the whole gang are back. As their owner Andy prepares to depart for college, his loyal toys find themselves in daycare where untamed tots with their sticky little fingers do not play nice. So, it's all for one and one for all as they join Barbie's counterpart Ken, a thespian hedgehog named Mr. Pricklepants and a pink, strawberry-scented teddy bear called Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear to plan their great escape.—Walt Disney Studios With their beloved Andy preparing to leave for college, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the rest of the toys find themselves headed for the attic but mistakenly wind up on the curb with the trash. Woody's quick thinking saves the gang, but all but Woody end up being donated to a day-care center. Unfortunately, the uncontrollable kids do not play nice, so Woody and the gang make plans for a great escape.—Jwelch5742 With 17-year-old Andy ready to leave the nest and spread his wings after the events ofToy Story 2 (1999), Woody and the toy gang sense the time for hard goodbyes is just around the corner. At least, living in the attic is better than nothing. Instead, as the young man heads off to college, a moment of distraction sends the entire collection to the promising Sunnyside Daycare Centre: a colourful place where once-adored toys get a second chance at love. But there's more to the local paradise than meets the eye. And when Andy's stranded toys discover a dark side, Buzz and his friends must summon every last ounce of courage for the great escape. The question is, however, will things be the same again?—Nick Riganas When the group of toys are mistakenly donated to a daycare centre, they do everything that they possibly can do to return home to their rightful owner who is about to leave for college. However, the daycare centre is run by a stuffed bear who has a hideous past.—RECB3 Andy Davis (voice:John Morris) is 17 years old, and is heading off to college in a few days. The fact that Andy has grown from a young boy to a teenager about to leave home has not been lost on his toys.Several of them hold out hope that Andy will play with them at least once before he leaves, but those hopes are soon dashed. As the toys take stock of how many are left, and those that they have lost over the years, their attention is drawn to the last of the little green Army Men: Sarge (voice:R. Lee Ermey) and two paratroopers. Fearful of being thrown away, they leap out the window into the world beyond, their parachutes taking them who knows where.This idea soon fills the heads of the remaining toys: Woody (voice:Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (voice:Tim Allen), Jessie (voice:Joan Cusack), Bullseye (voice:Frank Welker), Mr. Potato Head (voice:Don Rickles), Mrs. Potato Head (voice:Estelle Harris), three alien squeak toys from Pizza Planet, Slinky Dog (voice:Blake Clark), Rex (voice:Wallace Shawn), and Hamm the Piggy Bank (voice:John Ratzenberger).Several are of the persuasion that Sarge is right, and they'll be tossed out soon, but Woody believes that Andy wouldn't do that. He figures Andy will store them in the attic...maybe one day to be played with again when Andy has kids of his own.The toys' ""staff meeting"" is cut short when Andy returns to his room with his mom (voice:Laurie Metcalf) in tow. With only a few days left until he leaves, Andy has not cleaned up his room. Andy's mom is having Andy's sister Molly (voice:Bea Miller) clean her room as well, and tells the two to throw out what they don't want, store extra items in the attic, or donate items to Sunnyside Daycare. From Andy's room, the toys watch as Molly throws her Barbie doll (voice:Jodi Benson) in the donations box, along with some other toys.Andy finally takes out a black trash bag and begins to put his old toys into it. When he gets to Woody and Buzz, he hesitates before putting Woody in a box marked 'College' and tossing Buzz in the black trash bag. Inside, the toys think they are going to be thrown away, and Woody watches as Andy leaves the room. His panic turns to relief as he sees Andy open the attic door. However, before Andy can go up, he helps Molly move the donations box downstairs. The lapse causes the attic door to close, and Andy's Mom soon after finds the trash bag with the toys. Thinking Andy left trash lying around, she takes it with another bag to the curb.Woody looks down the street in horror as the garbage truck slowly makes its way to the curb. Woody jumps out the window and slides down a pipe to the front lawn...only to see the trash bags thrown into the garbage truck and crushed! Shortly thereafter, Woody notices a recycling bin walking towards the garage. Following it, he is relieved to see that his friends escaped. However, they are now all convinced that Andy meant to throw them away.Woody tries to explain what really happened, but most of them just feel that he is in denial. Jessie soon notices the box of donations to Sunnyside Daycare, and proposes that they all go there. Everyone eagerly jumps in, except for Woody, who demands that they all return to Andy's room right away. Before he can say anymore, the trunk to the family mini-van closes, and Andy's mom takes the box to Sunnyside.At Sunnyside, Andy's mom brings the toys in to the Butterfly Room. Looking through the handle-hole in the box, the toys are excited to see a group of children happily playing with the toys in the room.After the recess bell sounds and the kids leave the room, the toys eagerly escape from the box, only to meet a very friendly group of toys who are excited to see them. The group is soon joined by a strawberry-scented bear named Lotso (voice:Ned Beatty), who soon calls his associate Ken (voice:Michael Keaton) to escort the group around, showing them what Sunnyside has to offer. During the tour Ken becomes smitten with Barbie...who finds herself drawn to him as well.Lotso explains that the toys are taken care of, and that due to a never-ending supply of kids coming and going, the toys will never be without someone to play with them. Andy's toys eagerly accompany Lotso over to the Caterpillar Room, where he then leaves them to experience their first playtime at Sunnyside. However, Ken and Barbie appear to have gotten along quite well, and Barbie eagerly goes back with Ken and Lotso to the Butterfly Room.Woody explains that while Sunnyside does seem great, he strongly believes they should go back to Andy. Woody asks Buzz to come back, but Buzz refuses, saying they should stick together. Realizing that the others won't accompany him, Woody sneaks out of Sunnyside, but not before accidentally losing his hat. In the process, a little girl named Bonnie (voice:Emily Ricks Hahn) finds him and takes him home with her.Back in the Caterpillar Room, recess ends, and the toys get their first playtime...only to find the room filled with noisy screaming toddlers, each of them rambunctious and not as 'delicate' as Andy was. They are thrown around, smashed about and covered with poster paint by the toddlers. Once the daycare closes, the toys feel there has been some mistake and that they should be in the Butterfly Room instead. Buzz manages to get out of the room, intending to talk to Lotso. However, once outside, his attention is drawn to Ken and several other toys sneaking inside a vending machine.Buzz follows them, but is caught by a sleepy-eyed doll named Big Baby. Ken and the others take Buzz to the daycare's library and tie him up. Suddenly, Lotso comes across the other toys, and demands that they let Buzz go. Buzz thanks Lotso for helping him out, and makes his request for himself and the other toys to be transferred. Lotso admires Buzz's initiative, but is only willing to consider to have him join the Butterfly Room inhabitants. When Buzz refuses, Lotso orders Buzz held down and procures a Buzz Lightyear instruction manual from the library. Using it, the group of toys sets Buzz to ""demo"" mode &mdash; he's once again the deluded space ranger we met early in theToy Story (1995)Lotso, his compatriots, and demo-Buzz return to the Caterpillar Room, where Buzz subdues his friends and places them in prison-like storage cages. Lotso explains how the daycare is run: all newcomers start in the Caterpillar Room with the ill-behaved toddlers. If they survive, they move up to the Butterfly Room where they'll be treated better.To set an example about what happens to troublemakers, Lotso has Big Baby take Mr. Potato Head out to the playground and stuff him in ""the Box"" (a sandbox). Also as a warning, Lotso produces Woody's hat, although he doesn't explain what happened to the toys' friend. Barbie realizes that Ken lied to her and as she refuses to be part of Lotso's regime, she's imprisoned as well.During the toys' day at Sunnyside, Woody has been in Bonnie's house, taking part in her imaginative fun and games. Woody grows excited to be part of a real playtime again, but longs to get back to Andy.Once the household is asleep, Bonnie's toys help Woody access the family computer. Woody is relieved to find that Andy's house is just around the corner. He thanks the toys and tells them that if Bonnie ever outgrows them, they should go to Sunnyside. However, the name causes the toys to look on in fear. The toys explain that Lotso is responsible, and one of Bonnie's toys named Chuckles (voice:Bud Luckey) begins to tell a story.Lotso, Chuckles, and Big Baby were once owned by a little girl named Daisy. Of the three, she loved Lotso the most. However, one day at a rest stop, the three toys were accidentally left behind. The three eventually made it back to Daisy's house. Lotso and Chuckles managed to look in her window, only to see that Lotso had been replaced. Lotso, resentful of being left behind, declared they had all been replaced (even though there was only proof that he had been replaced). Big Baby still wanted to go back, but Lotso yelled ""She doesn't love you no more,"" and tore off a necklace around Baby's neck: a plastic heart that said ""I belong to Daisy."" Secretly, Chuckles kept it.The three toys went from place to place until they found Sunnyside. Lotso took over and set up the system in which most new toys would be subjected to the rough handling of the toddlers in the Caterpillar Room and would not survive. Chuckles explains that he eventually was broken at Sunnyside, and Bonnie took him in and repaired him. Realizing the danger his friends are in, Woody decides to return to Sunnyside and rescue them.The next day, Woody sneaks into the daycare and moves around the building above the ceiling tiles. Finding his way into a hidden area of the Caterpillar Room, he chances upon a Fisher-Price Chatter Telephone (voice:Teddy Newton). The telephone tells Woody that he should have stayed gone, and that there's no way that he and his friends can get out. Woody thanks him for the concern, but says they have to try. The Chatter Telephone explains what Woody and his friends will be up against: Lotso's minions manning search lights on the playground, trucks patrolling the halls and the playground, an 8-foot-high cinderblock wall, and a cymbal-clanging monkey (voice:Frank Welkeragain) that monitors the security cameras in the building. The telephone says the only other way out is through a garbage chute across the playground.Once the toddlers have gone to recess, Woody joins his friends, who tell him that Buzz was reset to demo mode, and now they want to get back to Andy. Woody sets his plan in motion. Later that evening, the group springs into action: Mr. Potato Head creates a scene to get put in the box again, this time as a way to get outside and report for the group. Barbie pleads with Ken that she can't take being imprisoned, and Ken lets her out. He takes her back to his dream house, where Barbie subdues him, and using one of his outfits as a disguise, infiltrates the daycare library to find the instruction manual for Buzz. Woody and Slinky Dog infiltrate the main security room and take down the cymbal-clanging monkey. Rex and Hamm start a fight to distract Buzz, allowing Jessie to escape. Then they trap Buzz under a plastic tub.The toys regroup and set about trying to get Buzz back to normal. However, a mistake in resetting Buzz sets him to Spanish mode. With little time left, the group decides to worry about fixing him later, and they set out for the garbage chute.The gang gets to the end of the chute before plummeting into the dumpster...only to find Lotso, Ken, and his associates waiting (along with the chatter telephone, now broken by the bad toys). Lotso offers the toys a choice: either end up in the dumpster, or return to the daycare. Jessie and Barbie both decry what Lotso has done to the daycare, and even Ken soon turns against Lotso.The eagerness of the group and Woody to return to Andy incites Lotso to declare that love doesn't exist. It is then that Woody mentions Daisy and produces the tag that Chuckles kept. Big Baby sees the tag, and Lotso declares that she didn't love them and replaced them. Woody reminds Lotso that it was only him she replaced. This revelation causes Big Baby to reach for the tag before Lotso destroys it, yelling at Big Baby for being stupid and believing that Daisy loved him. Big Baby, feeling betrayed, then throws Lotso in the dumpster.The other toys begin to run across the lid, but one of the Pizza Planet aliens' feet gets stuck in the lid. Woody goes to help him, only to have Lotso grab his hand. The others rush to help Woody, but just then, a dump truck pulls up and empties the contents of the dumpster (including Andy's toys) into the collecting bin in the back. Barbie and Ken, who were not on the dumpster's lid, can only watch as their friends are taken from them.Inside the dumpster, more trash is emptied onto the group, and a TV set falls on Buzz &mdash; which sets him back to his proper self. However, before the toys can rejoice, the truck arrives at the Tri-County landfill. They're shocked when a bulldozer scoops up the three Pizza Planet aliens, carrying them away! The remaining toys are shoveled by another machine onto a moving conveyor belt, headed towards a large shredding machine. The toys avoid being shredded by grabbing metal objects that are being magnetized to an overhead track. Woody and Buzz even manage to save Lotso, who thanks them.Once they make it through, they find themselves on another conveyor belt, heading towards what looks like daylight. However, as they draw closer, they soon realize it's a large pit that empties into a fiery incinerator. The toys try to outrun their fiery fate until Lotso notices an emergency stop switch. He motions for the others to help him, and they hoist him up to stop the machine. However, once he reaches the button, Lotso just smirks at Woody, muttering ""Where's your kid now, Sheriff?"" and runs off.The toys are soon unable to keep running, and tumble into the pit. They try to climb out, but there appears to be no escape. With no hope left, the toys all join hands, willing to stay together to the very end.Suddenly, a blue light appears overhead, and a giant claw falls down, scooping up the group. As they wonder who rescued them, the enormous claw swings by the glass cabin of the machine, where the three Pizza Planet aliens are. Once the group gets out, they thank their saviors and wonder what became of Lotso.Unknown to them, Lotso is found by another garbageman at the dump. Remembering that he had a Lots-a-Huggin' Bear as a kid, he ties Lotso to the grille of his dump truck and he heads off for duty.Andy's toys find the dump truck that services Andy's neighborhood and manage to get back before Andy leaves for college. After cleaning themselves up, they sneak back into the house, finding Andy's room cleaned out, except for some minimal items, and two boxes: one marked 'College,' the other 'Attic.'Woody's friends pile into the 'Attic' box, and say their goodbyes. Hearing Andy and his mom approaching, Woody hops in the 'College' box. As they enter Andy's room, his mother is hit with the sad reality that her son is going away. Andy tells her that even though he'll be gone, he'll still care about her.Hearing this, Woody realizes that Andy can still care for him and the other toys: an example of true love, in that you never forget those you really love. While Andy is distracted by his sister Molly and his dog Buster, Woody grabs a Post-It note and a marker and writes down Bonnie's street address. He takes the Post-It with him and hops into the 'Attic' box.Andy returns to the room and sees the note on the 'Attic' box. Thinking that his mom wrote it, Andy takes the box to the address and sees Bonnie playing in her family's front yard with the same quirky imagination that he had.Andy gets out of the car with his box. As Bonnie sees him approach, she stops her game and calls for her mom. Bonnie's mom (voice:Lori Alan) recognizes Andy, who explains that he has some toys for Bonnie. Andy introduces each of his toys, telling Bonnie a little bit about each of them, since he still remembers how he played with them: for example, Hamm saves your money but is also the evil Dr. Porkchop.With each toy revealed, Bonnie gets more and more brave, until after Buzz, she peeks into the box and sees Woody. Andy has no knowledge of how Woody got in there, but is surprised when Bonnie calls him ""my cowboy doll,"" and quotes one of Woody's lines: ""There's a snake in my boot!""Andy sees Bonnie looking at Woody, and explains to her how important Woody is to him: how long he's had him, and how brave Woody can be. However, he explains to Bonnie that she can have Woody, if she promises to take good care of him, and the other toys. When she quietly nods an affirmative, Andy begins to play with her, and the two are having an imaginative time with their toys. Secretly, Andy's toys are overjoyed at their last playtime with him.Finally, Andy gets into his car, as Bonnie gathers her old and new toys on the porch. As she holds Woody and Buzz in her little arms, she makes Woody wave goodbye. This causes Andy to give a sad but calming smile. ""Thanks, guys,"" he whispers, as he drives off.After Andy leaves, Bonnie's mom takes her inside for lunch, leaving the toys on the porch, watching Andy's car fade into the distance down the street. ""So long, partner,"" says Woody. Woody smiles at the other toys, reaffirming that Andy did care for them, and care for them enough to leave them with another child who will take care of them and give them many playtimes to come. Woody introduces his friends to Bonnie's other toys.Some time afterward, the toys find a note in Bonnie's backpack from Ken. In the time since Lotso has been gone, Ken and Barbie have worked to abolish the unfair system that ran Sunnyside, and now the toys have an equal opportunity to move between the Caterpillar and Butterfly rooms. The toys at Sunnyside now enjoy their time there, and soon after, Sarge and his two paratroopers arrive, with both Ken and Barbie welcoming them."
Alice in Wonderland,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014759/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Nineteen-year-old Alice returns to the magical world from her childhood adventure, where she reunites with her old friends and learns of her true destiny: to end the Red Queen's reign of terror. Alice, an unpretentious and individual 19-year-old, is betrothed to a dunce of an English nobleman. At her engagement party, she escapes the crowd to consider whether to go through with the marriage and falls down a hole in the garden after spotting an unusual rabbit. Arriving in a strange and surreal place called ""Underland,"" she finds herself in a world that resembles the nightmares she had as a child, filled with talking animals, villainous queens and knights, and frumious bandersnatches. Alice realizes that she is there for a reason--to conquer the horrific Jabberwocky and restore the rightful queen to her throne.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> A young girl name alice .when she first visited magical Underland, Alice Kings leigh is now a teenager with no memory of the place -- except in her dreams. Her life takes a turn for the unexpected when, at a garden party for her fiance and herself, she spots a certain white rabbit and tumbles down a hole after him. Reunited with her friends the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat and others, Alice learns it is her destiny to end the Red Queen's reign in terror—Jwelch5742 Facing an imminent arranged marriage to a soon-to-be English Lord, the spirited but troubled nineteen-year-old, Alice Kingsleigh, spots an unusually familiar rabbit scampering through the palatial estate's fragrant gardens. Could the well-groomed bunny be the same creature from her strange and insistent childhood dreams? The answer lies at the bottom of a deep and dark burrow--the mystical entrance to the wondrous world of Underland--where peculiar beings congregate around a never-ending tea party; a tyrannical queen uses every means possible to keep the throne she has usurped, and an unfulfilled prophecy awaits a dauntless champion. Is Alice, indeed, the ghastly Jabberwocky's fair-haired nemesis?—Nick Riganas Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is the daughter of Charles Kingsleigh (Marton Csokas), a wealthy man who planned to find profitable shipping routes through the world in the 19th century. When she tells him of her adventures in Wonderland (later to be revealed as 'Underland'), he declares her mad, but that all the best people are. However, many years afterward, Charles has passed away, and Alice misses his playful attitude.Now feeling trapped in a world of proper etiquette for one such as herself, Alice is taken to a garden party, where it is hoped that she will accept a marriage proposal from Hamish (Leo Bill), the son of one of her father's business partners. However, Alice soon grows distracted seeing a rabbit with a waistcoat nearby, and rushes after the strange creature.Following it, she finds her way to the trunk of an old tree some ways off, and falls down a hole. The hole leads her to a strange room, of which she finds a key, as well as a drink that makes her smaller, and a cake that increases her size. After getting the key and shrinking down to use a small door, she soon finds herself in an enormous garden area.Soon after, she comes across the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen), as well as the Dormouse (Barbara Windsor), a Dodo bird (Michael Gough), and the Tweedles (Matt Lucas). The White Rabbit explains that is sure he has found the right Alice this time, while the Dormouse believes he is mistaken. Alice explains that her name is Alice, but feels they are looking for another ""Alice."" They take her to Abosolom the Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), who consults a scroll, which contains details regarding the history of Wonderland, from it's birth onward. The scroll claims that on the Frabjous Day, Alice will return to slay the Jabberwocky. Alice sees this, and adamants that she is not the person in the scroll, when a commotion breaks out, and the Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover) appears, along with some red-carded soldiers and a creature called a Bandersnatch. Everyone scatters, as the Knave takes the scroll, and captures the Dodo bird. Alice, when confronted with the Bandersnatch, stands her ground, convinced that it is just a dream. However, the creature scratches her, and Alice takes off running, but not before the Dormouse plucks out one of the creature's eyes.Some ways off, Alice encounters the Tweedles again, who attempt to help her, but are soon captured by a giant bird that takes them to the Red Queen's castle. At the castle, the Knave of Hearts informs the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) about the scroll, and the prophecy of Alice killing the Jabberwocky (of which she possesses). The Red Queen orders Alice to be found, and the Knave utilizes a bloodhound named Bayard (Timothy Spall) to track her down, promising freedom for Bayard's wife and pups (a lie, meant as a way to get the dog to help the Red Queen).Meanwhile, Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), who leads her to the Mad Hatter's place, where she encounters the Dormouse again, as well as the March Hare (Paul Whitehouse). The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is pleased to see Alice, and is in rapture over the coming Frabjous day in which she will slay the Jabberwocky. Alice again insists she is not 'that Alice,' when the Knave of Hearts and Bayard close in. The Hatter stuffs Alice into a teapot, to hide her from the Knave. In secret, the Dormouse scolds the dog for bringing the Knave there, but Bayard explains why he came. He then attempts to lead the Knave off in a different direction.After they have left, the Hatter walks Alice through the nearby woods, where they come across the burned ruins of a small village. The Hatter then explains to Alice about how in the time she was gone, the Red Queen has taken over Wonderland, banishing the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to her own domain, and taking her vorpal sword.As they talk, the Knave again approaches, and the Hatter places Alice on his hat, and flings it across a river, giving himself up to the Knave, who takes him to the Red Queen. Later on, Bayard finds the hat and Alice. Alice manages to convince Bayard to take her to the Red Queen's castle, to rescue the Hatter. Along with the hat, they find their way there, where Alice encounters the White Rabbit assisting with a game of croquet with the Red Queen. Alice requests to be made larger (she is still the size of a gerbil), and the rabbit gives her a cake. However, she eats too much and ends up almost 10 feet tall, disrupting the croquet game. The Queen does not recognize Alice, who says she is 'Um' from Umbridge, and wishes to help the Queen. The Queen, impressed by the size of Alice's head, declares her to be made part of her royal court.The Hatter is brought before the Queen and Alice, and is at first intended to be beheaded. However, the Hatter manages to stall for time, by requesting that he make the Queen a hat for her enormous head. Flattered by the attention, she gives into this request. Alice soon after finds out that the vorpal sword is on the grounds of the castle, but is locked away in a chest in the quarters of the Bandersnatch. After procuring the plucked eye from the Dormouse (who has broken into the castle to free the Hatter), Alice manages to return the eye to the creature. This allows her to gain access to the sword. Alice goes to the Hatter's room, and finds the Dormouse there. However, the Knave of Hearts shows up shortly, and when the Dormouse lets slip Alice's true name, he attempts to kill her. Alice manages to escape into the courtyard, where the Bandersnatch helps her escape from the castle. Bayard also accompanies her, as they head for the White Queen's castle.The Red Queen then orders that the Hatter and the Dormouse be executed the next day. However, the Cheshire Cat uses his trickery to take on the guise of the Hatter, and allows the Hatter, Dormouse, the White Rabbit, the Tweedles, and Bayard's family to escape. They all soon meet up at the White Queen's castle, where the Queen has used her potions knowledge to shrink Alice to normal size.The next day then dawns...the Frabjous day. Almost everyone is willing to take up arms for the White Queen. However, she hopes that Alice will fulfill the prophecy, but Alice rushes off to the Queen's garden, still upset over everyone pushing her into this task. It is there she encounters Absolom, cocooning himself. It is here that Absolom explains to Alice how she had been to Wonderland before, and suddenly, it all comes back to her, that what she thought originally was a dream was real. After her revelation, Alice dons the armor prepared for her by the White Queen, and takes up the vorpal sword.Both the White Queen and the Red Queen meet on a checkerboard field. Both Queens meet first, with the White Queen asking her sister to not do battle, but the Red Queen refuses to give into the pacification of her sister's plea. The White Queen brings forth Alice as their 'champion,' as the Red Queen' summons the Jabberwocky. As Alice faces off with the creature, the rest of the armies go to war. Alice plays a mind-game with herself, talking of 6 impossible things, as it is claimed her father would do before breakfast. In her mind-game, she manages to find the strength to slay the Jabberwocky. The Red Queen demands that her subjects kill Alice, but as the White Queen's champion has slayed that of the Red Queen, the Red Queen's subjects will no longer follow her commands.The White Queen orders the Red Queen banished to the Outlands, for the crimes that she has committed (due to a the White Queen's vow not to harm a living creature, she will not kill her sister), with noone to offer her sympathy. The Knave of Hearts is also chained to her, as punishment as well. However, the thought of being alone with the Queen causes him to try to kill her, before his dagger is taken from him by the Hatter.After the Red Queen and the Knave are taken away, the White Queen's army rejoices, with the Hatter doing a Fudderwupping dance, much to the delight of everyone. The White Queen then collects some of the Jabberwocky's blood, and gives it to Alice. The blood of the Jabberwocky allows Alice to return to her world, and she returns to the Garden Party.Alice then explains to Hamish that she cannot accept his proposal, as well as speaks her mind to a number of different relatives and acquaintances. Her forthright attitude catches the eye of Hamish's father, and soon, the two discuss plans to expand the shipping routes to China, a land that has not yet been opened to the west.Alice is then made an apprentice to the company, and sets off with a crew to open the shipping route to China, aboard a ship titled ""Wonder"". The last thing shown is a bright blue butterfly, none other than Abosolom."

Tony Stark has become a champion for world peace thanks to the Iron Man suit, and has practically solved the issue of world peace, or so he claims.Six months after the end of the first movie, Tony Stark has used his Iron Man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only furthered when he fulfills his father's dream by reopening the ""Stark Expo"" in Queens, NY, to showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world. Tony fulfills this dream by flying into the expo in full Iron Man regalia, and making a flamboyant entrance to become the new symbol of world peace. Backstage, following his address, Tony does a quick test of his blood: the palladium he uses to power his chest arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body. After the event, Tony and Happy are leaving when they are approached by a woman who hands Tony a subpoena, summoning him to a Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing. Tony and Happy decide to take a road trip to Washington DC in Tony's new Audi R8.The next morning, during the Senate hearing, Tony's usual brand of humor becomes the center of attention while completely ignoring the fact that the government has classified the Iron Man armor as a weapon. Colonel Rhodes presents the investigation into the events surrounding Iron Man's creation, but Senator Stern, the committee chairman, takes his remarks out of context. With Justin Hammer of Hammer Industries present, Tony gives a rebuttal showing that he is Iron Man and will not part with his armor (likening handing himself over as being tantamount to indentured servitude), and proceeds to hack the committees computers to show that various ""attempts"" at copying Tony's suit - from Iran, North Korea, and even Hammer itself - are complete failures: North Korea's is top heavy and collapses easily, Iran's crashes into the ground and explodes, while Hammer's suit turns around 180 degrees at the waist and severs its pilot's spine. With his typical swagger, Tony still refuses to turn over the Iron Man armor to the government and walks out of the hearing.Back at home, Tony is on JARVIS analyzing the latest prototypes and developments for the Iron Man suit, and Pepper enters and the two argue about the future of Stark Industries. Tony is telling Pepper that he's making more money off the company's common stock than he ever did as CEO. He decides he's had enough of being the CEO and wants to focus solely on developing Iron Man. He decides to appoint Pepper as the new CEO, leaving her stunned. The next day a lovely notary public enters to have Tony officially sign the company over to Pepper. Tony is undergoing fighting training with Happy and performs an illegal move on him, getting it confused with MMA. The notary's name is Natalie Rushman, and he has Happy give her a boxing lesson, and while looking up her bio, Natalie performs a TKO on Happy, using a takedown that shows there's a great deal more to her than there appears.Tony heads to Monaco for some much needed R&R. At a reception before the Monaco 500, where Stark Industries is sponsoring a driver and has entered a Formula 1 racer, Tony is greeted by his favorite ""Vanity Fair"" reporter Christine Everheart, who wants Pepper for the cover of the next issue which will introduce her as the new Stark Industries C.E.O. Justin Hammer also happens to be there. They also greet Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, who wants a panel at the Stark Expo to showcase his latest invention. Tony takes another reading of his blood, finding that the palladium poisoning has increased. Tony decides that he's going to be driving the Stark Industries car instead of the driver that was pre-selected.Stark starts the race, but unbeknownst to him, Ivan Vanko has joined one of the race's pit crews. Under his jump suit, Vanko wears a harness with two large energy whips powered by the arc reactor he'd built after his father died. Vanko uses the whips to slice one car in half, cause a massive pileup and ambushes Tony. As Vanko is wrecking havoc on the track, Happy and Pepper rush to deliver the briefcase Happy carries with him to Tony. Vanko uses his electric whips on the Rolls Royce Phantom that Happy and Pepper are in, and after repeated ramming attempts, Pepper finally manages to give Tony the briefcase. Tony activates the case which is a portable version of the Iron Man armor. After a furious battle, Tony is able to defeat Vanko by manually pulling out the Arc Reactor battery that powers his whips, crushing it after he has JARVIS analyze it. The police grab Vanko and take him into custody, the defiant Vanko yelling at Tony ""YOU LOSE!!"". The entire crowd is stunned at what they've just witnessed. Justin Hammer, however, believes that Vanko can be put to better use.Stark gets a private meeting with Vanko in custody. Vanko asks Tony what it feels like to be a dead man and that palladium in the chest is a very painful way to die. Stark tells Vanko that makes two of them.Later, Hammer breaks Vanko out. He slips Vanko a meal consisting of chicken and mashed potatoes along with a note telling him to ""enjoy the potatoes."" Vanko and another prisoner are given uniforms with the same identification. Vanko immediately kills the prisoner as well as a guard on his way out the door, and sets the explosive device contained in the potatoes and as he makes his escape, he's bagged by two Hammer operatives and taken away. Hammer knows Vanko needs his resources to outdo Tony, and Vanko obliges. Hammer then hires Vanko to build armored suits based on existing designs. Vanko tells Hammer they are doing everything wrong. He also requests that Hammer retrieve his pet cockatoo from his home in Russia.On the plane back home, Tony and Pepper are watching the aftermath of the events that took place and are watching a rather angry Senator Stern unload his frustrations with Tony on The O'Reilly Factor. Stern is saying that Tony Stark lied to the Senate Armed Forces Committee, and that he's in danger of being arrested on felony perjury charges: Stark had told the Senate that other countries, as well as Hammer Industries, were 20 years away from having anything that remotely resembled Iron Man, however Vanko surprised everyone by making an working copy of the Arc Reactor. Tony presents Pepper with a gourmet meal and is going to tell her the truth, but they have an awkward moment as Pepper knows that something is up and that Tony isn't telling her the whole truth.Back home, Tony is using JARVIS to conduct investigations into Ivan Vanko. He finds that Vanko's father Anton Vanko was Howard Stark's partner and one of the co founders of Stark Industries. Howard Stark found out that Vanko was conspiring to sell weapons to the Soviet Empire and had him arrested for treason and deported to Russia, where he was imprisoned. His son had been seeking revenge against the Stark empire ever since. While sitting in one of his hot rods in his basement, Tony nearly collapses and is discovered by Rhodes who tells him that this isn't a good look for him. He shows Rhodey how the palladium is slowly poisoning him. Rhodes also tells him that he's been battling with the Pentagon by stopping them from coming to his Malibu house and taking his suits to be used for weaponized purposes.Tony prepares for what he believes will be his last birthday party. He asks Natalie what she would do if this were her last birthday party. Natalie responds that she'd do whatever she wanted with whoever she wanted to do it with. While at the party, Tony is quite drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit and behaving recklessly with its weaponry. In the background, Pepper and Rhodes are discussing that he's gone way off the deep end. Rhodes tells Pepper that he's tired of dealing with the Pentagon and the Senate Armed Forces Committee. Rhodes, finally having enough of Tony's antics, goes and dons the silver Mark II suit. He then challenges Tony to a fight, where Tony has the in-house DJ play some good background tunes. The battle ends in a stalemate and Rhodey flies off in the Mark II armor, delivering it to military authorities at Edwards Air Force Base. Justin Hammer is later invited to study the suit himself and provides them with advanced weapons to arm it.The next day, Tony is at the famous Los Angeles landmark doughnut shop Randy's Doughnuts, sitting in the Iron Man suit atop the famous giant plastered doughnut. Disgraced and hungover, Tony is approached by SHIELD director Nick Fury, who tells Stark that despite the problems he's having with the government and his drunken Iron Man antics, which are the least of his worries, Fury has an issue to deal with in the Southwest United States. Tony wonders if Fury and the ""Avengers Initiative"" is real, and Fury reassures Tony that it's real, and that he knew Howard Stark very well, in fact Howard was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D., the agency he works for. They are joined by agent Phil Coulson and Natalie Rushman, whose real name is Natasha Romanoff, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent planted in Stark Industries to monitor Tony himself. A hungover Tony is stunned at this revelation and fires Natalie/Natasha, but she then tells Tony that it's none of his business and that he's under investigation from S.H.I.E.L.D. , and she and agent Coulson are there to make sure Tony follows orders and doesn't screw up. Fury and Natasha both mention Tony's palladium poisoning; Tony replies that he's investigated and tested every know element and every permutation of them with no success. Natasha injects Tony with a serum that slows the symptoms of his palladium poisoning significantly, giving him the time to find an alternate element to keep him alive. In the meantime, Tony will be confined to his Malibu home.Fury tells Tony some more detail about Anton Vanko's relationship with Howard Stark and provides Tony with a chest of his father's old artifacts that can hopefully be used to find a cure for his condition. Tony resists further attempts from S.H.I.E.L.D. interference, but Agent Coulson reassures Tony that he's not going anywhere until Tony finds the answers that he's seeking about his condition. Reviewing the film reels in the chest, Stark discovers a message from his father that leads him to the original 1974 diorama of the Stark Expo. He retrieves the diorama from his old office, now occupied by Pepper, and tries to reconcile with her. In reality, the diorama is a disguised diagram for the atomic structure of a new element that Howard couldn't produce in his time but Tony may be able to with his advanced knowledge and modern technology.Stark performs a radical alteration of his home workshop and hand-builds a small particle accelerator with the aid of his computer system, J.A.R.V.I.S. Stark synthesizes this new element, creating a new triangular chest arc reactor that cures his poisoning and is much more powerful than Stark's earlier versions. Just before Tony completes the particle acceleration, Coulson tells him that he's free to go and that S.H.I.E.L.D. has reassigned him to another case in New Mexico.At Hammer Industries, Vanko has radically changed the design of Hammer's suits: they are now automated drones. Despite what Vanko considers improvements, Hammer is displeased and imprisons Vanko in a small room with two guards while he takes the drones to the Stark Expo.Hammer unveils his new military drones, captained by Rhodes in a heavily-weaponized version of the confiscated Mark II armor. Unfortunately, it is soon discovered that Vanko has pre-programmed the drones, giving himself complete control. He also has control of Rhodes' new armor, and Stark arrives just as they go on the attack. As Stark battles these remote-controlled enemies and tries to evade Rhodes, Happy Hogan and Romanoff race to Hammer's Queens facility to stop Vanko. When they arrive, they fight their way through Hammer's security guards; Happy is pleased he took one of them down but is slightly flustered when he sees that Romanoff has taken down at least a half-dozen in short order. Vanko has already departed for the Expo in a new armored suit, an updated version of the harness he used when he attacked Tony in Monaco. Back at the Stark Expo, just as Hammer has finished his presentation, the drones attack the standing-room-only crowd and they begin to flee. Stark and chases after the drones and engages them while Agent Romanoff and Pepper have Justin Hammer arrested for harboring the fugitive Vanko.Natasha is able to give Rhodes control of his armor again so that he and Stark can fight the rest of the drones together. The two armored allies combine their powers and successfully destroy all the drones. Vanko then lands in the area, wearing a greatly updated armored suit with improved plasma energy whips. After a grueling battle, Stark has an idea for he and Rhodes to use a trick from their earlier battle during Stark's birthday party, firing their energy repulsors to collide and create the same explosion with Vanko caught in the middle. The maneuver takes Vanko down, but Vanko's armor and drones are revealed to have been equipped with self-destruct charges. As they begin to explode, Stark races to save Pepper, rescuing her at the last moment. After landing on a roof she quits her CEO position, and she finally gives Tony a kiss, to which they both find Rhodes sitting a few meters away. Tony finally tells Pepper the truth about his heart, upsetting her greatly. Stark tells Rhodes to leave, but Rhodes then claims he was there first, so they should get their ""own roof"" after Stark tries to defend himself.At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that while Stark is ""unsuitable"" for the ""Avengers Initiative,"" SHIELD wants Stark as a consultant. Stark agrees on the condition that Senator Stern personally present him and Col. Rhodes with their medals for bravery, however Senator Stern is less than amused when he presents Tony with his medal.In a post-credits scene, SHIELD agent Coulson is seen driving to a remote impact crater in the New Mexico desert. He informs Fury over the phone that they've ""found it""; in the crater is Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor."
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1325004/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As a string of mysterious killings grips Seattle, Bella, whose high school graduation is fast approaching, is forced to choose between her love for vampire Edward and her friendship with werewolf Jacob. Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger as Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob -- knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella is confronted with the most important decision of her life.—Summit Entertainment Isabella Swan was a normal teenage girl, in a normal world. Until she met Edward Cullen and Jacob Black. Since then she has been up against a Sadistic Vampire, The Volturi and an angry werewolf, Paul. But what lies ahead is something only Edward's 'brother', Jasper Hale, can help the Cullens with, who have a secret on their side. With Graduation coming fast, Bella gets more and more worried about becoming immortal. But the real question is: Who will she choose?—Jemma From England With the long-awaited high-school graduation day just around the corner, Bella--more than ever--must find the courage to grapple with her confronting feelings for the lethally charming Edward, and the ferociously handsome Jacob, after her short-term breakup inThe Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009). Now, against the backdrop of a brutish killing spree in Seattle and a fierce rivalry between clans, a vengeful and relentless adversary amasses an invincible army of immortals, hell-bent on revenge. Once more, passion demands a sacrifice--and as an honourable but frail pact timidly forms in the name of love--the gallant suitors must set aside their vast differences to defend Bella. Indeed, this is an impossible love triangle; however, in the aftermath of desire, will the mortal enemies accept Bella's tough decision?—Nick Riganas Bella and Edward have been reunited, but their forbidden relationship is threatened to be torn apart again with an evil vampire still seeking her revenge. And Bella is forced to choose between her true love for Edward or her friendship with Jacob Black as the struggles between vampires and werewolves continues. But there is still another choice for Bella to make, mortality or immortality?—Mel from the United Kingdom. Eclipse opens at nighttime where Riley Biers (Xavier Samuel) is exiting a store on his way home. A driving rainstorm begins as he walks on his way. Without warning, he is knocked down. Looking around, startled, he cannot see anyone-- the street he is walking down appears completely deserted. Getting scared, he pulls his coat closer and picks up his pace. Just as suddenly he is hurled through the air and against a wall-- and still there is nobody and nothing in side. Riley starts to yell for help and breaks into a run. He gets too close to a pier on a marina and almost falls into the water. Terrified, he screams out to his unseen assailant what he wants. There is a blur as something rushes past far too quickly to be seen, and Riley's hand is wounded. He screams in agony and falls to the ground-- and the wound on his hand strongly resembles some kind of bite wound.Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are in a meadow where she is reading from ""Fire & Ice"" in preparation for an English final. Edward again asks Bella to marry him, and runs into the old impasse-- he asks her, ""marry me,"" and Bella responds with, ""change me."" Finally Edward offers a compromise where he will change her when they're married. Bella kisses him but then says it's more like coercion. Their views om marriage differ and she teases him about the divorce rate. Edward assures her that the ""vampire-human divorce rate"" is lower. They kiss more and Bella says she's due back home at four. Edward just smiles as she gathers up her things and starts on her way home.Charlie (Billy Burke) is reading the newspaper headline that discusses a rash of murders in Seattle. Bella arrives home exactly at four like Charlie wanted. There is a bit of brief debate about her being grounded ""for life"" (as in New Moon) and Charlie admits that he would like to see a bit of separation between Bella and Edward, even though he expects her answer that Edwart is part of her life. So Charlie offers her a deal. He'll end her punishment if she agrees to see some of her other friends as well, and suggests she see Jacob, as Billy has told Charlie that Jacob is going through a very rough time lately, and just a short time ago, when Bella was in that position, Jake was there for her when she needed him. Bella calls Jacob but gets his voice-mail and chooses not to leave a message. A voiceover from Bella explains that Jacob hasn't spoken to her in weeks, and she's been hoping to set things right. She pulls a handwritten letter out of her dresser drawer and looks at it briefly.Bella gets into her truck to drive to the reservation, but it won't start. Suddenly Edward is in the passenger seat. He knows she was heading to the reservation, and Bella realizes that Alice saw it, and that Edward rigged her truck to not be able to start, in order to prevent her from driving there. They argue about her seeing Jacob. She is adamant that she has until graduation but Edward is obsessed with her safety and is convinced she won't have any among the Quileutes.The next day at school, during lunch, Edward joins Bella at her main table with Mike (Michael Welch), Eric (Justin Chon), Jessica (Anna Kendrick) and Angela (Christian Serratos). Jessica is the class valedictorian and Mike and Eric are helping her prepare her speech. Alice (Ashley Greene) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) join them all as well, and Alice stuns them all with an announcement that she is going to host a graduation party-- at the Cullen home. Jessica and Angela are pleasantly shocked, as nobody has ever been to the Cullen home before (except Bella of course). Suddenly Alice sits back with a worried look on her face, and Bella quickly realizes she's having a vision of something. But neither she, Jasper nor Edward will discuss it with her.Edward drives Bella to the police station where Charlie is on duty. They see him with Riley Biers' parents discussing his 'missing persons' case-- Riley has been missing for a year now. Bella realizes Edward knows something about it, and he tells her that the Cullens have been paying very close attention to the rise of murders and disappearances in Seattle. They suspect vampires and believe that if the crime wave escalates, the Voluri will take action. Bella is worried that the Volturi will then make their way to Forks and see that she is still human, but Edward assures her it won't come to that. The Cullens are prepared to go to Seattle if need be to try and get to the bottom of things themselves.As Riley's parents exit the station, Charlie comes out as well. Edward tells Charlie that Carlisle and Esme have bought a plane ticket for Bella to fly down to Jacksonville for a few days to visit her mother Renee. Charlie is surprised but agrees to the visit. Bella is reluctant until it is revealed that Edward will be going with her. This Charlie doesn't like so much but he still consents to the trip.Bella is in Jacksonville laying in the sun with her mother Renee (Sarah Clarke). They are talking about her college plans. Renee hopes Bella will consider a college in Florida, both because it will let her see her daughter more, and because Bella was always a sun-lover. Bella is planning to attend college in Alaska, saying they have a good science program, but Renee knows better-- she knows Bella is in love with Edward and wants to follow him. Finally Renee gives Bella her graduation present-- she collected college T-shirts from every state and sewn them together into a quilt for Bella. Bella is touched and hugs Renee gratefully.Back in Forks, it is nighttime and the Cullens are standing watch in the forest. Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) asks Alice if she's certain this is the spot in her vision. Alice is certain, and they keep watch. Suddenly Alice alerts them to look to their left. The Cullens all take off in pursuit, and it is seen they are chasing Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard); Alice had foreseen her return to Forks. Emmett (Kellan Lutz) nearly catches Victoria but she wriggles free and keeps running with the Cullens in hot pursuit. Finally Victoria leaps across a stream-- into Quileute territory, where the Cullens are under treaty not to venture. Victoria and the Cullens continue running down opposite sides of the stream when the Quileute wolf pack, having smelled Victoria's presence, emerges from the trees in pursuit of Victoria. Looking to pit one side against the other, Victoria cleverly leaps back and forth from one bank of the stream to the other. Both sides narrowly miss catching her. Finally Emmett loses his patience and jumps after her onto the Quileute lands. Victoria's plan pays off as Paul (Alex Meraz) moves to block Emmett from crossing into Quileute territory. So intent is Paul on not letting Emmett pass that Victoria escapes from both sides in the confusion.Edward and Bella have returned to Forks and are driving to school. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is there waiting. He confronts Edward about the Cullens trespassing on Quileute territory. Naturally Bella wants to know what Jacob is talking about, and Edward evasively says that Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding. Jacob is amused despite his anger and finally helps Bella put two and two together-- Alice's vision in the lunchroom was Victoria's return to Forks, and Carlisle and Esme bought her the plane ticket to Florida to get her out of town so she would be safe from Victoria. Bella is furious at Edward's lie, but also confronts Jacob on not caling her. He says he had nothing to say, and Bella says she has plenty. She climbs on Jacob's motorcycle behind him despite Edward's protest and rides with him to the reservation.Some of the wolf pack members are there to greet them on their arrival, teasing Jacob about his continuous thoughts about whether Bella would call him, and whether or not he should call her. Bella then meets Leah Clearwater (Julia Jones), Harry Clearwater's daughter. On Leah's shoulder is both the mark of a Quileute wolf-pack member... and a chip larger than Bella's truck.Sam Uley (Chaske Spencer), the leader of the wolf-pack, and his fiance Emily (Tinsel Korey) emerge from the house. Emily goes to hug Bella as Sam and Jacob talk about Victoria's return. Sam assures Jacob that Victoria won't get through their line again. As they enter the house, Bella glances over her shoulder to see Leah assume wolf form and practice the cliff-dive.Bella and Jacob are talking later. Jacob explains how Leah and her younger brother Seth gained the gift of the 'spirit warrior' (ability to assume wolf form) after Harry died. Jacob also explains that Leah was once in love with Sam, and he loved her in return, until Emily came into the tribe's life. Jacob explains to Bella, the Quileute wolf-pack's process of 'imprinting' on someone-- an event that bonds a male and female as complete soulmates. The imprinting process is often very sudden, spontaneous, and beyond the control of the wolf-pack member doing the imprinting. As all the wolf-pack members can always hear each other's thoughts, they always have to live with the pain Leah feels about losing Sam, and Sam's guilt over imprinting on someone else after he and Leah had grown so close. Bella begins to suspect that Jacob has imprinted on her, but Jacob says that if he'd imprinted on anyone, Bella would know it for certain. He's still him, and as he says, Bella is still Bella. But when Bella says, 'until graduation,' Jacob realizes that Bella intends to go through with becoming a vampire, which sickens him beyond belief. In a fit of disgust he voices a preference for Bella to die rather than let her become something that is unnatural and neither dead nor alive. Quickly he curses himself for going too far, looking painfully stricken at Bella's expression of indignant anger.At the Swan house, Riley is in Bella's room. He fingers the dreamcatcher on her bed and steals one of her red blouses, sniffing it closely. Stealthily descending the stairs, he passes Charlie asleep on the couch and bends over him as if to feed on him. But Riley then hears the door open, and using his speed, escapes from the house undetected.Bella comes into the house, and Charlie is pleased when Bella tells him she was with Jacob and not Edward. But suddenly there is a knock at the door and both of them realize it's Edward. Bella steps outside to greet him, but he is deeply concerned. He almost broke the treaty to make sure she was okay. Suddenly he smells something and rushes up to her room. Fingering her dreamcatcher, he tells her that someone's been in her room.Edward brings Bella back to his house. Edward didn't recognize the scent of whoever entered Bella's room. The Cullens have scouted around the area and determined that the scent vanished five miles south of Bella's house. They suspect a nomad vampire might be involved, as Alice would have seen a vision of Victoria. They suspect the Volturi might be involved, but Alice disagrees, saying she's also been watching Aro, the Volturi ruler, through her visions.The Cullens are discussing another round of protection vigils over Bella's house (to the displeasure of Rosalie (Nikki Reed)). Bella knows that the Cullens cannot keep watch over her and Charlie, and still search for both Victoria and the mysterious intruder, all while keeping themselves fed.It is dayime and Bella has brought Jacob to her house so he can get the scent of the intruder. Outside Jacob tells Edward that he will know the scent if he crosses it again. Edward refuses to trust Jacob and Bella has to force herself between them to break them apart. A voiceover from Bella explains the extremely uneasy partnership between the Cullens and the Quileute wolf-pack, as they guard the house in shifts-- the wolves relieving the Cullens at intervals so they can hunt for animal blood to feed on (two wolves are seen relieving Alice and Emmett as Bella watches).Edward and Bella go to meet Jacob on the shoulder of a road through the woods. Edward is dropping Bella off to spend some time on the Quileute reservation. Despite the partnership, the antipathy between Edward and Jacob drips out of the very air between them whenever they are face to face. Edward passionately kisses Bella goodbye in front of Jacob, and Jacob in turns gives Bella an affectionate hug before Edward drives off.Jacob brings Bella to attend a meeting of the Quileute tribal council. Some of the younger pack members are attending, including Seth (BooBoo Stewart), who Bella meets for the first time. Seth's mother, Sue Clearwater, is on the council now after the death of her husband Harry. Bella is to attend the gathering as the first person not of the tribe to hear the tribe's histories.Billy Black (Gil Birmingham) recites a story of the Quileute tribe as spirit warriors; shapeshifters; able to assume the form of a powerful wolf. He tells of the tribe's first encounter with one of the Cold Ones. Two spirit warriors vanquished one of them after it had fed on some of the tribe. But the Cold One vanquished had a mate (like Victoria was the mate of James) and she attacked the village in vengeance. The Tribal Elder, Taha Aki, engaged her in combat. The Cold Woman was winning the battle and seemed poised to kill him, when Taha Aki's third wife, who had no powers and could not join the battle, stabbed herself with a knife so the Cold Woman would smell the blood and be distracted, allowing Taha Aki to recover and slay her. Taha Aki's third wife is celebrated as a heroine of the tribe for her selfless courage; her sacrifice of herself saved the village and the people. The Cold Ones are the only remaining enemy of the Quileute people. The magic in the tribe's blood awakens when they are near. Billy warns that conflict is near... and the tribe must be ready to face it.In Seattle, Riley is watching over a small scene of violence and Mayhem. He bends over a teenage girl, Bree (Jodelle Ferland), who we see has just been changed into a vampire. Bree is confused and terrified over her new state, and Riley only tells her he'll ""find her someone to drink"" and suggests she ""try not to get killed.""Back at the Cullen home, Edward is arriving with Bella. They find Carlisle, Jasper and Emmett watching a news report about the escalating violence in Seattle; the rise in killings and disappearances. Jasper knows that no one vampire could cause such destruction. The Cullens realize that the culprits are ""newborns,"" which they explain to Bella is the state when a human is first transformed into a vampire; their first few months as one. This is when a vampire is at their most vicious, uncontrolled state, overwhelmed with a wild thirst for blood. The newborns are completely undisciplined. Jasper and Carlisle deduce that someone is creating a small army of them. This means they must go to Seattle to try and stop it. The newborns are being created to destroy someone or something-- the Cullens are the only vampire family close enough to be targets. Carlisle knows that if the Cullens don't stop the newborns, the Volturi will arrive to do so-- he's surprised they haven't stepped in yet. Edward theorizes that the Volturi are actually behind the uprising; he knows that Aro and Marcus dearly want for both himself and Alice to join them, and if the rest of the Cullen family were slain, they would have nobody else to go to.Bella is arriving home to find her father looking at a missing persons poster for Riley, made by his parents when he first vanished. Charlie notes that they are still desperate to find their son even after a year. Bella wonders why they keep looking, and Charlie answers that he would do so in their place, if it were Bella that was missing.At night, Bella is lying beside Edward in her bed. Despite her determination to become a vampire, she is coming to terms with knowing she can never see her family or the rest of her friends again, as her body will never age and she will appear 18 years old even when she's supposed to be 40. Edward uses this as more ammo in the argument not to change her. He warns her that he's been through the consequences she will face for undergoing the change. She believes that Edward has a soul, but he doesn't, and he cannot bear the thought of taking her soul away just so she wouldn't grow old and die as his mortal wife. Even though he'd eventually lose her, he feels that taking her soul away would be the most selfish act he could do.The next day Bella is on the reservation with Jacob, admiring the beauty of the land. She invites him to the graduation party, though she is not surprised at his lack of an answer; going to the Cullen home is the last thing on his 'to-do' list. Bella notes there's something on his mind. Jacob says he didn't want to be so forward, but there's no time left; she needs to hear the truth. Jacob confides that he is in love with Bella, and he is fighting for her heart; he desperately hopes she will choose him over Edward. He puts her hand on his chest so she can feel his heart beating and that he is a living being of warm flesh and blood. With him, Bella would never need to change; she would never need to give up being human or say goodbye to her family. Bella tries to explain that she doesn't feel that way for him, but Jacob doesn't buy it; he is convinced she just doesn't want to admit it to herself. He intends to fight for her until her heart stops beating, and is visibly pained at her response that he wouldn't be waiting for long. Jacob says that unlike Edward, he can kiss her without fear of hurting her. But Jacob goes too far when he grabs Bella and passionately kisses her to demonstrate his point; kissing her without her consent. Bella blazes with anger and she slams her fist into his face. Jacob doesn't flinch; he barely feels the punch... but Bella does, and her hand is broken. When Jacob drives her home, Edward is there, ready to start an altercation with Jacob for hurting Bella-- he read Jacob's thoughts. He demands that Jacob wait next time for Bella to ask for him to kiss her, and Jacob vows that one day, she will.Charlie has to separate Edward and Jacob, and he is amused at Jacob's explanation that Bella broke her hand hitting him in the face. Bella's insufferable clumsiness and tendency to be accident-prone makes the explanation completely plausible to Charlie.Edward brings Bella to his house where Carlisle bandages her hand and determines that it is not actually broken, but merely sprained. Emmett is amused at Bella's bravado in hitting Jacob and there is a brief exchange of teasing words between them about her becoming a newborn. Rosalie hears, gets very annoyed, and she curtly leaves the room. Bella follows her, determined to finally get an explanation of why Rosalie hates Bella so much. Rosalie smiles sardonically and even a little sadly as she says she doesn't hate Bella... in fact she envies her, because unlike Rosalie herself or any of the Cullens, Bella has a choice, and Rosalie is the most adamant that she is choosing wrong.Rosalie finally opens her heart to Bella and tells her about herself as a human in the early 20th century. She was engaged to the town's most eligible bachelor, a man named Royce, even though she didn't know him that well. She was young and a romantic, in love with the idea of being in love. But one fateful night she happened across him on a street corner where he was with some of his friends, and all of them were drunk. He tried to come on to her, and she pushed him away, seeing he was drunk. In response Royce grabbed her and brutally raped her, and then beat her within an inch of her life, all while his friends watched, and they left her in the street to die-- and as Rosalie tells Bella, she dearly wanted to have died. But Carlisle happened across her, and changed her in order to save her, though to Rosalie, he wasn't actually helping her at all. The two things in her vampire existence that brought her true happiness and pleasure, were exacting a brutal vengeance on Royce (we see a flashback of her smashing into his apartment wearing a wedding dress and smiling wickedly), and finding and falling in love with Emmett. But even her relationship as Emmett's mate, to her, is incomplete. She is young and beautiful, but she would give it up in a moment to be able to bear Emmett's children. She and Emmett are frozen in time, and she does not fear or worry that she would grow old as a human-- she would do it in a minute if both she and Emmett could become human again and raise their own family. Bella sympathizes with Rosalie but insists that Edward is the one thing she wants more than anything else in life. But Rosalie knows better. She knows that once Bella is a 'newborn,' there is one thing she will want more; one thing she will crave so desperately, she will kill in order to get it... blood.On the streets of Seattle, the newborns are causing more havoc and violence. Riley furiously reins them in, reprimanding them about the need to keep a low profile. He tells them something big is coming on the horizon, and they can't gain control of themselves, then they'll all soon die, including himself. He looks out to the sky, seemingly worried about something.High on a rooftop, watching, is the source of Riley's worry, even if he doesn't know it-- Jane (Dakota Fanning) is watching the scene unfold, along with Felix (Daniel Cudmore), Alec (Cameron Bright) and Demitri (Charlie Bewley). Jane has, in fact, been keeping close tabs on the newborn uprising, and the Volturi are concerned. Felix believes that the amount of attention the newborn uprising has drawn, will cause other vampires to question the effectiveness of the Volturi, and that the four of them should consult Aro. Jane silences Felix with her power to cause intense pain, and says she knows that Aro's decisions are being watched, which is why the four of them were sent here; they must decide themselves. Jane is deep in thought over whether to terminate the newborns immediately, or to first let them do what they were created for-- she knows they were created for a reason.Graduation Day arrives at Forks High School. Jessica's valedictorian speech centers around what kids want to be when they grow up, and this time in all their lives being about making mistakes, changing their minds, and this being what enables them to finally know what their future will be. Bella is thoughtful as she listens; knowing that it applies to her and her desire to join Edward.The senior class is enjoying a lively party at the Cullen home. Bella congratulates Jessica on her speech. Bella is surprised when Jacob shows up at the party. Jacob apologizes for kissing her against her will, and gives her a hand-made bracelet as a graduation present; a bracelet with a small wooden carving of a wolf.Alice comes down the stairs, and stops in her tracks, a look of worry on her face. Both Bella and Jacob know she is seeing another vision. Alice grimly tells them that the Cullens aren't going to need to go to Seattle-- ""they are coming here.""The Cullens convene with Bella, Jacob, Quil and Embry in the den. Carlisle explains to Jacob about the newborn army-- newly changed vampires. Having read Alice's mind, Edward has seen her vision and has determined that the missing teenager, Riley Biers, is among them; possibly even a leader in the army, though he is not their creator... Carlisle realizes that whoever is behind the uprising knows of Alice's power and is exploiting the 'blind spots' in her visions to stay under the radar. The worst part, though, is that Alice saw Riley passing around the red blouse he stole from Bella's room so all the newborns could get her scent. The newborns are coming to Forks and will arrive in four days... and their mission is to kill Bella.Carlisle tells Jacob that this means the Cullens have to face the newborns in what is sure to be a terrible and ugly fight. He knows lives will be lost. Jacob looks at Quil and Embry, who silently nod to him without hesitation. Jacob says that the Quileutes are in; they will fight alongside the Cullens to destroy the newborns. Carlisle says that Jasper has extensive knowledge of newborns, including how to battle and defeat them. He asks Jacob to see if Sam will agree to the wolf-pack meeting with the Cullens so they can all train in these combat methods. Jasper is satisfied that the newborns will have no knowledge of the Quileute wolf-pack, thus giving them and the Cullens an edge, in addition to sufficient numbers. Bella is against Jacob fighting, but he waves her off, reminding her that battling and killing vampires is the wolf-pack's job; the reason they have their powers. He also reminds Bella that she has long desperately wanted to see the Quileute wolf-pack and the Cullens set aside their differences and work together.The next day the Quileutes meet with the Cullens in the woods. They are in wolf-form, still not trusting the Cullens enough to take human form when they will be more vulnerable. Edward, who can read their minds, volunteers to 'translate' for them. Edward says that the Quileutes are asking how newborns differ from other vampires. Carlistle explains that the newborn stage is when a vampire possesses the greatest degree of physical strength and power, because their own human blood still lingers in their bodies. Jasper has the experience they will all need to learn to fight and defeat them.Jasper explains what he knows of a newborn's immense power and how they fight. He admonishes everyone that a newborn will often try to move behind an enemy and get their arms around them, which will allow them to crush their enemy in their grasp instantly. Jasper warns everyone that they must never go for an obvious kill, because a newborn will know to watch for it... and they will turn the tables. Jasper puts his family members through a training session practicing combat tactics and moves to use against the newborns. Jasper himself is the best fighter in the family; the only one who can even match him is Alice, who can not only foresee his actions, but as his mate, she knows him better than anyone else.After the training is done for the day, Bella asks Jasper if there's any way she can contribute to the battle. Jasper answers that her scent will distract the newborns and divert their attention; their hunting drive and bloodthirst will take over and make them vulnerable. Bella is curious about Jasper's knowledge and experience with newborns. Jasper simply smiles and lifts his sweater sleeves, showing battle-scars on his arms. He regales Bella with stories of his human life as a major in the Texas army, fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Near Galveston he met a woman named Maria who was a vampire; looking to change others so they would be able to destroy Union soldiers in battle. Maria was dangerously clever and cautious. She made use of Jasper's power to control the emotions of others, and had him destroy the newborns before they had been a vampire for one year, in order to cover her tracks. But Jasper could feel all the emotions of every newborn he killed and realized that Maria didn't love him, but rather controlled him like a puppet. Finding Alice was what helped him escape and become free. She had seen a vision of him and gone to meet with him. Alice finds her way to them and she shares a passionate kiss with Jasper, and Bella smiles and politely turns her head away.Later that night Bella has a dream of Maria whispering something into Jasper's ear, gently coaxing him into killing someone. She sees this as if she were the one Maria was directing Jasper to kill. Just before Jasper lunges, Bella dreams that Maria suddenly has Victoria's face and voice. Awakening in her room, in Edward's arms, Bella says that the dream has given her the final piece of the puzzle. She realizes that Victoria is the mastermind behind the newborn army, and she is using a second-in-command to do all the dirty work, in order to evade being seen in Alice's visions.As if in answer, we see Riley in Seattle delivering another hapless recruit to Victoria.In the morning, outside the house, Edward is telling Bella that he will taking her to a hidden spot away from the battlefield. With the Quileute wolf pack fighting beside them, the Cullens will be able to handle the newborns, but Bella, as a human, will be too vulnerable. In the chaos of the battle, it would be too much risk of a newborn slipping past the defenders and reaching her. Bella argues that if she and Edward are too far apart, they will both be too worried about each other and both of them will be vulnerable. For once, Edward assents and agrees-- but instead of bringing her to the battlefield, he will go with her to stand guard over her at her hiding place.The two of them meet Jacob and Jasper on a field in a woodland clearing. Jasper has chosen this site for the battle to take place, believing it will provide them with a tactical advantage. Bella's scent must end at this field-- the newborns must be able to track her to it, but not past it. This means she must be carried to the campsite where Edward will be guarding her-- and Edward cannot carry her there because the newborns will still be able to pick up Bella's own scent. But Jacob, as a werewolf, has a scent that vampires find so repellent that it will mask Bella's trail effectively. The newborns won't smell Bella past the battlefield, only the smell of werewolf which they won't be able to stand. Edward doesn't like the idea but he won't question Jasper's knowledge on what will give them every edge they can get in the battle. Too much rides on it.Jacob and Bella talk as he carries her through the woods. Despite the tactical reasons for it, he's sardonic about Edward not being in the battle, but Bella won't try to talk Jacob into not being part of it. Bella knows Jacob would refuse to honor her wishes. Jacob mentions that as Billy's son he had the right to be the alpha wolf of the spirit warriors, but as he originally didn't even want to be one of the wolf-pack at all, he yielded the alpha position to Sam, and Sam feels Jacob will be needed on the battlefield. When Jacob remarks that every choice has its consequences, Bella knows he's referring to her becoming a vampire and asks him to let it rest-- everyone makes their decisions and she's made hers. Jake says he knows that Bella feels something for him; he can sense it about her... and that the Sam-Leah-Emily triangle is proof that she can love more than one person. Bella thinks Jacob is about to try and kiss her again. He just smiles and says he promised not to until she asked. Bella thinks he will have to wait a long time for that, but he thinks she's wrong.Back on the field, Edward is waiting. Jasper has followed Jacob and Bella partway to make sure the plan is working. Jasper tells Edward that he could only smell wolf, meaning Bella's trail has ended on the field as planned. Despite Jasper's assurances that the plan is working, Edward's reaction shows how much effort he has to exert to follow the plan. The thought of Jacob carrying Bella is too harsh for him.Bella is driving home. She finds Alice leaving her house, chatting pleasantly with Charlie-- she's charmed her way into his good graces. Out of Charlie's earshot, Alice tells Bella she's arranged a cover story; that the Cullens are going on a camping trip and Charlie has agreed to Bella having a sleepover with Alice so that Alice will have some company. In fact it is Edward who will be at the Cullen house with her, while Alice goes with the Cullens into the woods to hunt for animal blood so they will be ready for battle. Charlie is going fishing so Bella won't have to worry about him being concerned for her.Inside the house, Charlie confirms that unlike Edward, Alice meets with his approval. Bella asks her father why he never remarried after the divorce with Renee. She's looking to get his viewpoints on marriage to help with her own decision whether to marry Edward, although of course she doesn't tell him that. Charlie says he never really met the right woman for him after the divorce, but he sees value in marriage, pointing to Renee's happy marriage to Phil. He does, however, mention that it tends to work out better, later in life, not earlier as a result of 'not being careful.' This leads to a rather awkward chat about premarital sex (and whether Bella is still a virgin) that leaves both Charlie and Bella rather embarrassed.Bella arrives at the Cullen house for the 'sleepover.' Edward adds a small diamond to Bella's charm bracelet. Going up to his room, Bella sees he has brought a bed in for her to sleep on. Bringing up Edward's desire to marry her as a condition for changing her, Bella says she wants to negotiate her own condition, and gets Edward to promise her anything she desires. But then Bella starts to come on to him and he backs off, afraid of hurting her. Bella begs him to 'try,' because she wants him while she's still human. They start to kiss and make out, but when Bella starts to undress herself, and he sees that she wants to have sex, Edward again backs off. His ""old school"" values that Bella had assured Charlie that Edward has, start to assert themselves and he says that back during his days as a living mortal, he would have done things different, including a full courtship, and asking her father for her hand, before proposing. But as he speaks, he takes one knee and presents Bella with an engagement ring that belonged to his mother. He restates his request for Bella to marry him. Bella's heart is finally touched the right way and she says yes.On a secluded rooftop in the darkness over Seattle, another conversation, much more sinister, is taking place. Victoria is gently admonishing Riley not to underestimate the Cullens. Her ""dead friend"" (Laurent) is a testament to their powers-- Laurent learned about them and they killed him. Victoria sweetly tells Riley that this is the Cullen family's hunting grounds, and she is afraid of them retaliating against her for trying to slake her own thirst. Riley assures her he'll make the city safe for her, and they begin to kiss. Riley has fallen in love with Victoria and has bought her lies hook, line, and sinker. He clearly has no idea what her true motives are... he's become the Jasper to Victoria's Maria.The next day Bella and Edward are walking through the woods so she can 'mark' a trail leading to the field. Bella's pricked her finger so she can leave a drop of blood at intervals. She finds that Edward has gained the ability to resist the lure of her blood completely, brought about by when he thought Bella had died (back in New Moon). He notes she's not wearing the engagement ring and Bella says she doesn't want to lose it, but Edward knows she also doesn't want Jacob to see it. Bella gives in and says she feels they should wait to tell him. She wants his mind to be focused on the battle. Jacob arrives at that moment-- he'll be carrying Bella the rest of the way. Edward says that Alice has seen a storm coming, and Jacob says he can feel its approach.As Jacob carries Bella, a storm of a different kind also begins moving toward Forks; Riley is leading the newborn army through the woods and across a lake. Clearly he knows the land and how to get where the army needs to go.Jacob arrives with Bella at a small secluded plateau among the mountains, well defensible. Edward has a tent set up. Jacob reveals he will be staying the night at the campsite as well; in the morning, Seth will relieve him so that Edward and Bella can stay apprised of the battle through Seth's telepathic link to the pack. Seth wants in on the battle, but assisting Edward with guard duty over Bella will keep Seth out of trouble.Nighttime comes, the storm blows across the mountains and the temperature drops dangerously low. The tent, the sleeping bag and Bella's own winter clothing all prove inadequate, and she is shivering miserably with cold. Jacob enters the tent, having heard Bella's soft moans of discomfort. Edward realizes that Jacob intends to use his own 109-degree body heat to keep Bella warm, and is dead set against it. Jacob warns Edward that Bella is in danger of getting frostbitten. Edward's distrust for, and rivalry with, Jacob is so intense that it takes every iota of his will to assent to Jacob holding Bella, even for the purpose of keeping her warm.Edward and Jacob finally manage to speak civilly while Bella is asleep. They discuss their respective feelings for Bella. Jacob asks if Edward ever considered that Bella might love him as well, even if she wouldn't admit it to herself, and if Jacob could provide a good life for her. Edward insists he has tried to stop Bella from making him change her, and admits that he understands that Jacob can protect her as well as Edward can, and that Jacob can give Bella a human life. Jacob asks Edward how he coped with the belief that Bella had died and he'd lost her. Edward says he wouldn't wish it on anyone. Bella's greatest wish comes true as Edward finally admits he's glad Jacob is here. Edward and Jacob finally have found some measure of common ground.Morning comes. Seth arrives at the campsite so that Edward will know that Jacob has gone scouting and will return soon. As Seth leaves, Edward and Bella talk about the nighttime experience. Bella knows how hard it was for Edward to let Jacob do what he had to do; he says it's not on his list of favorite evenings. She's amused that Edward has a 'list' of his favorite evenings... at the top of the list, is, naturally, her accepting his proposal. He jokingly calls her Mrs. Cullen and she jokes back that in the 21st century, she has the right to choose whether to change her name.But it is no longer a joking matter when she finds that Jacob has returned and overheard that Bella is planning to marry Edward. She turns toward Edward, furiously angry when she realizes that Edward knew he was standing there. Edward simply says that Jacob deserved to know the truth. Jacob storms off and Bella starts to follow. Edward tries to grab her arm but she sternly warns him off.Bella rushes after Jacob, pleading to him as he curtly says he's off to kill some vampires-- and maybe let one of them kill him in turn. She begs him not to be reckless, and when he won't listen to her reason, she goes into a near-panic and asks him to kiss her. This he does, and they share a long, passionate kiss. Jacob says he has to go to the battlefield but he'll return. Bella realizes Edward knew what was going on-- he says Jacob's thoughts are very loud. Edward understands that Bella loves Jacob, but takes comfort in her assurance that she loves him more.Seth returns to the campsite, taking Jacob's place there so his telepathic link to the pack will keep Edward up to date on the battle.The Cullens stand on the battlefield, waiting as the newborn army rushes forward. On Jasper's signal, the Cullens rush forth into battle, luring the newborns to the rock outcropping behind which the Quileutes await. Led by Jasper, the Cullens and the Quileutes fight together with expert teamwork, allowing them to overwhelm the newborns who, despite greater numbers, fight blindly and recklessly. Victoria is seen observing the battle briefly before rushing off.Bree is the one newborn who is afraid and deeply uncertain about what she's been ordered to do. Seeing the newborns being decimated, she starts to run, only to be cornered by Carlisle and Esme (Elizabeth Reaser). The two look at each other, sensing Bree's terror and uncertainty.Back at the mountain camp, Edward realizes Victoria is near-- he can hear her thoughts. She had noticed Edward was not on the battlefield, and also knew that he wouldn't leave Bella's side, meaning once she found him, she'd find Bella. She's managed to track Edward to the campsite. Edward realizes Victoria is close, and not alone. He urges Seth to hide for ambush.Riley slowly walks out of the trees to confront Edward. Edward tries to reason with Riley, appealing to his logic, explaining Victoria's intent on avenging James and caring for nothing else, and she chose Riley to be her second in the newborn army only because Riley is a Forks native and knows the town and area well. Victoria arrives on the scene and pleads gently to Riley about her love for him and her warnings about Edward's mind tricks.Riley's desire for Victoria ultimately wins out over his logic.and he rushes to attack. Seth intercepts him and tears off his hand. Seeing the odds start to turn against her, Victoria begins to flee. Needing to keep her from escaping again, Edward calls out to her and taunts her about his killing James. She turns and glares as Edward goads her about her need to hurt him because of how he killed her lover and mate. Victoria starts to blaze with furious anger and she leaps at Edward in a rage. They fight and Edward throws her into a tree, which she begins to climb. Getting Bella to one side, Edward pushes the tree down and leaps at Victoria.Seth is distracted by the sound, and Riley kicks him viciously in the snout, knocking him unconscious. He joins the fight between Edward and Victoria, and turns the tide. Seeing Riley and Victoria working together and poised to kill Edward, Bella scrabbles desperately in the snow. She finds a rock with a sharp edge and, taking a page from Taha Aki's third wife, Bella lacerates her arm, letting her blood flow freely. Both vampires quickly smell her blood and are struck with blood frenzy, breaking their concentration and allowing Edward to turn the tide of the battle again. Seth recovers and seizes Riley, dragging him away. He cries desperately to Victoria, but she finally reveals her true nature and abandons him to try and feed on Bella, who stands before her unflinching. Edward intercepts Victoria and grapples with her. Outmaneuvering her, he rips her head off and kills her.Seth growls urgently and Edward notes that Alice needs them all on the battlefield. He burns Victoria's body and they rush to regroup with the Cullens and the Quileutes.Alice has seen the approach of Jane. As Edward, Bella and Seth arrive, Carlise urges the Quileutes to hurry away, because he knows the Volturi will not honor a truce with them.One newborn has survived and is lurking in ambush. Leah leaps on him, but this last newborn is tougher than his brethren. He is about to overpower Leah when Jacob joins the battle, but even then the newborn is able to maneuver around and grab Jacob from behind in a crushing bear hug that shatters the right side of his rib cage. The Quileutes finally finish the newborn off, but Jacob is badly injured, Leah cursing him for risking his life. The pack rushes to his side. Carlisle determines the extent of Jacob's injuries. He tells them that Jacob's wolf powers will allow his body to heal very rapidly, but because Carlisle cannot go with the Quileutes to treat Jacob immediately, this will cause his bones to begin to mend out of proper alignment-- this means when he arrives to treat Jacob, Carlisle must re-break them in order to set them properly. He promises to meet the pack at Billy's home as soon as possible. Quickly Jacob's tribe mates, all in human form now, gently lift him and carry him away.The Volturi arrive and survey the battlefield. Jane is only mildly impressed that the Cullens survived and that she and her underlings were not needed. She then notices Bree cowering behind the Cullens. Carlisle and Esme say they offered Bree asylum in exchange for her surrender, but Jane coldly states the Cullens had no asylum to offer. She torments Bree with terrible pain, interrogating her to learn about her creation. But Bree doesn't know who the leader of the newborn army was-- Riley trusted none of them with the knowledge. Edward slyly suggests that the Volturi knew about Victoria, but Carlisle insists that if they had known, they would have acted early and stopped her themselves. Carlisle and Esme vow to take responsibility for Bree, but Jane says the Volturi don't offer second chances-- the Cullens will be in enough trouble when Caius learns that Bella is still human. Bella quickly says, ""a date has been set."" Jane backs off from Bella but orders Felix to destroy Bree. Knowing that trying to protect Bree will bring the full wrath of the Volturi upon them, the Cullens resignedly step out of Felix's way, leaving the terrified Bree to her fate.Bella arrives at Billy Black's home to hear Jacob screaming in pain, which makes Billy shudder. Carlisle is re-breaking Jacob's ribs so that he can set them properly. Carlisle soon emerges from the house and says that Jacob is out of danger and will start to recover, and he'll return as necessary to help. A grateful Billy shakes Carlisle's hand as he would a friend's. Carlisle tells Bella that Jacob was asking for her.She goes into his room and they talk. Jacob knows that Bella has made her choice and he can no longer fight it. He is still struggling to accept the truth, and desperately wishes he could still change things, but he knows that he has lost the battle for Bella's heart. She asks if she can return to see him again. He says he will need time, but will wait for her-- even after her heart has stopped beating.Bella and Edward are in a meadow talking about the wedding. Edward is amused that Bella is letting Alice plan the whole affair out. He again questions her about her desire, and she explains that as much hardship as she's endured in Edward's world, she's never felt ""normal"" as other people define it, and only by making the world of the Cullens into her own world as well, has she felt a true sense of completeness. Remaining human was what she 'should be,' but joining the Cullens was who she truly 'was.' She jokingly tells Edward there is one more dangerous task ahead of them-- they have to tell Charlie about the wedding. Edward puts the engagement ring on her finger and they kiss passionately as the screen fades to black."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As Harry, Ron and Hermione race against time and evil to destroy the Horcruxes, they uncover the existence of the three most powerful objects in the wizarding world: the Deathly Hallows.

On their own out in the world, the trio must rely upon one another as evil forces threaten to tear them apart. Will they succeed? Will Voldemort finally be stopped? What is the mystery behind the Deathly Hallows?—Blazer346 The film begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) starting their search for Voldemort's Horcruxes. Meanwhile, Severus Snape arrives at Malfoy Manor to tell Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and the rest of his council that he's been appointed the new Headmaster of Hogwarts. He also tells them that the Order of the Phoenix will be moving Harry Potter from Privet Drive to a safe house. Voldemort uses Lucius Malfoy's (Jason Isaacs) wand to avoid using twin wands in a dueling battle.After Harry's 'family' The Dursleys flee their home, the Order of the Phoenix arrive to meet Harry along with six others: Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione, Fred (James Phelps) and George Weasley (Oliver Phelps), Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) and Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden). They all take Polyjuice Potion to become Harry's doppelganger's.
Harry and the six copies leave Privet Drive accompanied by a protector whilst the real Harry flies alongside Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) on his flying motorbike. They are intercepted almost immediately by Death Eaters and the pairs scatter. Voldemort arrives but Harry manages to defeat his borrowed wand and the group arrive safely at the Burrow. All but Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who was killed by Voldemort and Mundungus, who disapparated when he saw Voldemort arrive. George has a bad head wound from a curse Snape conjured during the battle. Ron convinces Harry to remain at the Burrow until after Bill (Domhnall Gleeson) and Fleur's wedding before going to find more horcruxes. Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), arrives at the Burrow and distributes the items from Dumbledore's last will and testament to Ron, Hermione and Harry. Ron receives the Deluminator, Harry gets the missing sword of Gryffindor and the first Snitch he ever caught and Hermione gets a personal copy of ""The Tales of Beetle the Bard"". During the wedding, Harry sees Xenophilius Lovegood (Rhys Ifans) and notices a strange symbol on his necklace. Harry speaks to Elphius Doge (David Ryall), one of Dumbledore's oldest friends and Ron's Aunt Muriel (Matyelok Gibbs) and learns that Dumbledore used to live in Harry's hometown, Godric's Hollow. A Patronus message sent by Kingsley Shacklebolt (George Harris) appears and warns that the Ministry has fallen, Scrimgeour is dead and that 'they are coming'. Death Eaters appear and trash the ceremony, leading Ron, Harry and Hermione to apparate to London.Taking refuge in a cafe, they discuss their immediate plans but before they can leave two Death Eaters arrive and begin dueling. The trio win the battle and disapparate to Grimmauld Place where they discover that Regulus Arcturus Black (Sirius's younger brother) is the R.A.B in the false locket found at the end of Half-Blood Prince. Kreacher reveals that the real locket was in the house but Mundungus stole it when he looted Grimmauld Place. Harry sends Kreacher to get Mundungus who in turn explains that Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) took it from him in return for not revoking his peddler's licence. The trio decide to break into the Ministry, now under the eyes of Death Eaters to retrieve the locket.Harry, Ron and Hermione capture three Ministry workers and impersonate them to enter the secret Ministry offices but are quickly split up. Hermione ends up in a courtroom with Umbridge to witness a false trial, Ron is in Head of Magical Law Enforcement (Death Eater Yaxley's) office and Harry is free to wander the corridors since he unwittingly copied a Death Eater Runcorn. Harry eventually finds his way to Umbridge's office but doesn't find the locket so he makes his way to the courtroom alongside Ron. They reunite with Hermione and stun Umbridge to take the locket and attempt to leave the Ministry. However, their Polyjuice Potion begins to wear off and during the battle to Floo away, Yaxley catches them as they reach Grimmauld Place.
Since they cannot safely stay at Grimmauld Place now Yaxley is a secret-keeper, Hermione apparates them to a forest. Ron gets splinched in the process, meaning the group can't apparate until he has recovered. They attempt to destroy the locket but their magic proves useless on it so they take turns wearing it despite its negative effects on their morale. While wearing it, Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing Gregorovitch (Rade Serbedzija) the wand-maker and going off in search of a mysterious wizard said to have robbed his shop many years ago.As they apparate around the countryside to camp in secluded areas, Ron becomes increasingly suspicious that Harry and Hermione are becoming more than friends. While wearing the locket, Ron overhears Hermione discover that if they can find the sword of Gryffindor, they can destroy all of the Horcruxes. This realisation that they must find another thing in a location they don't know, coupled with his rising suspicion and resentment, drives Ron to leave the group and return home. Harry and Hermione are forced to teleport away, leaving Ron no way to return even if he wanted to. Hermione takes his exit badly so Harry dances to a radio with her to try and cheer her up but the romantic situation is too much for Hermione, making her revert back to sadness. Harry decides to visit Godric's Hollow, both because it would be the first time since Voldemort attacked him and because he wishes to meet Bethilda Bagshot (Hazel Douglas), a magical historian who claimed to 'know the Dumbledores better than anyone'. They find the church graveyard and Hermione notices that a grave bearing the name 'Ignotus Peverell' has the same symbol on it as the one on Mr. Lovegood's necklace and in the book left for her by Dumbledore. Harry finds his parents' gravestones and an old woman approaches them as they pay their respects. Harry guesses that she is Bethilda and they follow her home. Harry sees a picture of the teenager from Gregorovitch's memory as Bethilda leads him to the attic of the house. Hermione wanders around downstairs. She finds signs of a bloody attack whilst the woman in front of Harry decomposes before his eyes into Voldemort's snake, Nagini. After a fight, Harry and Hermione escape with the only casualty being Harry's wand. Hermione says that the teen from the memory was Gellert Grindelwald.In the forest where they spend the night, Harry sees a Patronus doe watching over them and follows it to a frozen pond. He discovers the sword of Gryffindor at the bottom and as he swims down to get it, the locket goes crazy and attempts to drown him. Ron appears and saves him with Harry convincing Ron to destroy the locket with the sword. Harry opens it using Parseltongue. As it opens, a ghostly black cloud erupts from it whilst it shows Ron horrific images including spiders. A ghostly Harry tells Ron that Mrs. Weasley wanted him as a son whilst a ghostly Hermione mocks him, asking him why she'd choose him over the Chosen One before they begin kissing. Ron angrily attacks the locket, destroying it with the sword before he returns to the tent with Harry. Hermione is furious at Ron for leaving and returning as if nothing happened but the trio decide to visit Mr. Lovegood to find out about the mysterious symbol.At the Lovegood house, Mr. Lovegood teaches them about the Deathly Hallows - an invincible Elder Wand, a Resurrecting Stone and the invisibility cloak - and tells them the story of the three Peverell brothers who owned them all. When the group attempts to leave, Mr Lovegood reveals that Death Eaters have taken his daughter, Luna (Evanna Lynch) and that he must keep them there before they give her back. They escape the ensuing attack but apparate to a previous camping ground where a group of Snatchers are waiting to capture them and take them to the Ministry. Hermione uses a Stinging Hex on Harry's face to disfigure it but the Snatchers see the scar under the swelling. Instead, they take the trio to Malfoy Manor to collect the reward for Harry's capture.Since the Malfoys and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) can't be sure the disfigured wizard is Harry, despite the fact he's travelling with Ron and Hermione, they refrain from summoning Voldemort until the swelling has gone down. However, Bellatrix sees the sword and believes it to be in her vault at Gringott's Bank. She imprisons Harry and Ron in a cellar where they find Luna, Ollivander (John Hurt), and a goblin. Bellatrix meanwhile brutally tortures Hermione to try to find out how they stole the sword. Wormtail takes the goblin upstairs to be interrogated, and Harry summons Dobby (Toby Jones), who frees Luna and Ollivander before breaking Harry and Ron out. They go to rescue Hermione and the goblin, but despite winning the duels with Dobby's help - Harry manages to win Draco's wand and picks up Bellatrix' wand - Bellatrix throws a knife that stabs and kills Dobby as they disapparate. Harry gives Dobby a proper burial on the beach where they appear.The movie ends with Voldemort opening Dumbledore's tomb and taking the Elder Wand."
Inception,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O., but his tragic past may doom the project and his team to disaster. Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.—Warner Bros. Pictures Dominic Cobb is the foremost practitioner of the artistic science of extraction, inserting oneself into a subject's dreams to obtain hidden information without the subject knowing, a concept taught to him by his professor father-in-law, Dr. Stephen Miles. Dom's associates are Miles' former students, who Dom requires as he has given up being the dream architect for reasons he won't disclose. Dom's primary associate, Arthur, believes it has something to do with Dom's deceased wife, Mal, who often figures prominently and violently in those dreams, or Dom's want to ""go home"" (get back to his own reality, which includes two young children). Dom's work is generally in corporate espionage. As the subjects don't want the information to get into the wrong hands, the clients have zero tolerance for failure. Dom is also a wanted man, as many of his past subjects have learned what Dom has done to them. One of those subjects, Mr. Saito, offers Dom a job he can't refuse: to take the concept one step further into inception, namely planting thoughts into the subject's dreams without them knowing. Inception can fundamentally alter that person as a being. Saito's target is Robert Michael Fischer, the heir to an energy business empire, which has the potential to rule the world if continued on the current trajectory. Beyond the complex logistics of the dream architecture of the case and some unknowns concerning Fischer, the biggest obstacles in success for the team become worrying about one aspect of inception which Cobb fails to disclose to the other team members prior to the job, and Cobb's newest associate Ariadne's belief that Cobb's own subconscious, especially as it relates to Mal, may be taking over what happens in the dreams.—Huggo Mr. Cobb a unique con artist can enter anyone's dreams and extract the most valuable ideas and secrets of people with the help of ""inception"" (a dream sharing technology) when the state of mind is at its vulnerable best. Cobbs ability has made him the face of corporate spying, hence a wanted man too. Seeing his abilities, he is approached by Saito to carry out an almost impossible mission not to steal, but to plant the idea into the mind of the legal heir of a billion dollar enterprenauer. Mr. Cobb, with some specialists, must do the impossible in order to get back his life in a completely different ""world of dreams"" facing his own demons.—Mahesh Shelatkar Dom Cobb is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconsciouses. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage, but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.—Jwelch5742 A young man, exhausted and delirious, washes up on a beach, looking up momentarily to see two young children (Claire GeareandMagnus Nolan) playing in the sand before he passes out. An armed guard (Tohoru Masamune) discovers him and has him brought to a large, seaside palace where the proprietor, an elderly Japanese man, is told of the stranger's arrival. The only objects found on him were a handgun and a brass top. The old man allows the stranger entry. He is dragged in and given some food which he struggles to eat as the old man picks up the brass top and says, ""You remind me of someone...a man I met in a half remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical notions."" The stranger looks up in realization as the scene shifts...Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), speak to a prospective client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), in an eerily similar dining room about the services they provide; specifically protection against thieves specialized in extracting valuable information from a subject while they're dreaming. Cobb explains that, when one is asleep, one's mind is vulnerable to attack and what he can do is train Saito's mind to subconsciously defend against extractors to protect whatever secrets he may be hiding. He backs up his claim by revealing that he is the most skilled extractor there is and knows all the tricks involved. Appearing skeptical, Saito stands to leave, telling Cobb he will consider his proposition, and exits the room to join a small party in the main hall.Arthur casts Cobb a glance, saying, He knows as the room begins to shake. They walk to an outside balcony where other party-goers mingle and Arthur points to a woman nearby, asking Cobb what she's doing here. Cobb assures him that he'll take care of it and to proceed with the job. He knows where Saito's secrets are; he glanced over at a safe the minute Cobb mentioned the word.Cobb approaches the woman who asks if he misses her. He responds that he does but can't trust her anymore. They retreat to a private room where Cobb ties a rope to the leg of a chair and tosses the end out of the window. He tells the woman, Mal (Marion Cotillard), to take a seat as she asks him if the children miss her. Cobb pauses a moment before saying, ""I can't imagine."" He then repels out the window to a ledge below, nearly falling when Mal leaves her seat. He breaks into the room below and accesses the safe, swapping out the manila folder inside for another, as the lights in the room turn on. He turns with his gun out to see Mal aiming a gun at him and standing beside Saito and a guard holding Arthur. Cobb asks Saito if 'she told him' as he slides his gun across the table. Saito responds, ""That you are here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?""This proves true: the three of them are hooked up to a PASIV (Portable Automated Somnacin IntraVenous) device which feeds them the sleep drug Somnacin, keeping them all asleep and allowing dream-sharing. They are watched over by Nash (Lukas Haas), another of Cobb's partners. He checks Saito, sleeping on a bed, before going into another room to check on Arthur and Cobb, both asleep in chairs. Cobb's chair sits above a tub full of water. Explosions and shouts outside get closer as a mob of rioters moves down the street.Inside the dream, Mal holds her gun to Arthur's head but Cobb tells her the threat is empty, as he hands the manila folder over to Saito, since shooting him will only wake him up. Mal smiles in agreement but says that pain is only in the mind and perceived as real as she shoots Arthur in the knee, causing him to cry out. Cobb dives across the table and retrieves his gun before shooting Arthur in the head. He then dashes out of the room under gunfire from Saito's guards.Arthur wakes up and instructs Nash that things are falling apart but Cobb still has time to finish the job before he checks on the still sleeping Saito.Saito frantically opens the manila folder as the dream begins to collapse and shouts in anger as he finds blank pages inside. Cobb manages to hide away for a moment to look at the contents of the real folder which he'd hidden in his jacket, gazing over the confidential files as the building crumbles around him. Saito is crushed by debris and wakes up in the apartment, unseen to Arthur as he reaches under his pillow. Arthur tells Nash to wake Cobb by giving him the kick. Nash pushes Cobb backwards into the tub and, as he hits the water, Cobb's dream is flooded with massive waves cascading through the windows before he wakes up. Saito, having reached under his pillow for his gun, grabs Arthur but is subdued by Cobb who tells him that not all the information he needed was in the file he stole. Saito laughs and claims that all the information he had was in the file because he knew of Cobb's ruse all along. He allowed Cobb and Arthur into his mind as part of an audition which they failed, saying that 'your deception was obvious.'Asserting that his employer, Cobol Engineering, won't accept failure, Cobb throws Saito on the floor and demands that he tell them what they need to know about his expansion project. With his face pressed into the carpet, Saito begins to laugh again and reveals that he is familiar with the material of the carpet; it is supposed to be made of wool instead of polyester. Thus, he comes to the conclusion that he is still sleeping.Sure enough, Saito, Arthur, Nash, and Cobb are all asleep in the car of a train, watched over by a young man named Tadashi (Tai-Li Lee) who monitors the time remaining on the PASIV device. He places headphones over Nash's ears and plays music as a cue that their time is running out. The music plays faintly within the dream but enough that Nash can hear it. As the rioting mob outside draws nearer, Saito commends Cobb on creating a dream within a dream but becomes confused at his inability to control this dream. Nash reveals that they're not in Saito's dream...they're in his. The mob breaks through the door, attacking everyone in the room, and Arthur, Nash, and Cobb wake up on the train. Cobb berates Nash, the architect of the dream, for designing the carpet wrong and throws Tadashi a wad of money before leaving, telling them 'every man for himself'. Saito wakes up moments later to find himself alone in the car, save for Tadashi who's resumed a casual pose, but smiles wryly to himself.
In his apartment, Cobb spins his brass top and takes his gun, pointing it at his temple as the top spins. When it falls, he breathes a sigh of relief and puts the gun down. His phone rings and he picks it up to hear his two children, James and Phillipa (Johnathan GeareandTaylor Geare), on the other line with their grandmother. They ask when he's coming home and he responds that he can't because of work. When James asks if their mother is with him - an image of Mal crosses his mind - Cobb pauses and tells him that 'mommy's not here anymore'. He tells them to behave and that he'll send presents with grandpa before their grandmother hangs up.Arthur knocks on the door and tells Cobb their ride is on the roof. Cobb decides to fly to Buenos Aires to lie low in lieu of their failed job for Cobol while Arthur says he's returning 'stateside'. Cobb asks him to send his regards as they open the door to the helicopter and see Nash, beaten and bruised, and Saito waiting for them. Apparently, Nash had tried to sell out Cobb and Arthur for his own safety but Saito has other interests. He offers Cobb a job performing 'inception' for him, something Arthur claims is impossible. Cobb, however, says that it's not impossible but extremely difficult since it involves planting an idea in someone's mind rather than extracting one. He turns away, insisting that he'll find a way to resolve relations with Cobol himself but Saito then asks him if he wants to go home to his children in America. He promises Cobb that, if he succeeds, all he will need to do is make a phone call and the charges keeping Cobb out of the country will be dropped. Desperate, and to Arthur's exasperation, Cobb accepts.They board the helicopter with Saito while two thugs carry Nash away to an uncertain fate. En route, Arthur explains to Saito the nature of inception, telling him that simply planting an idea in someone's head does not guarantee that the idea will take. The subject may very well discover that the idea is not theirs and reject it. True inspiration, Arthur claims, is impossible, despite Cobb's thoughts otherwise. Saito shares with them his reasoning for the job; he needs the CEO of a competing energy conglomerate to split up his father's company, ensuring Saito's own Proclus Global complete domination over the energy production industry. Despite the daunting task, Cobb agrees to perform the job. Saito drops them off at the airport and advises Cobb to choose his team wisely.Cobb travels to Paris where he meets up with his father-in-law, Miles (Michael Caine), a professor at a university and the one who taught Cobb and Mal about dream-sharing and designing dreams. Cobb asks for an architect, one as good as he, and Miles points him to someone better. He introduces Cobb to a graduate student of his, Ariadne (Elliot Page) who is immediately put to the test by Cobb to design a maze that takes one minute to create and two to solve. After impressing Cobb with her skills, he tells her more about his line of work and what is required of her. Her job as architect will be to design dreams and create virtual mazes for the dreamers subconscious to inhabit while allowing Cobb and his team to work. As they talk outside a cafe, Cobb attempts to make Ariadne aware that they are actually in a dream. The realization causes Ariadne to panic and the dream violently collapses. When they awake, Ariadne finds they are in Cobb's warehouse workshop where Arthur is monitoring them. Ariadne shows surprise when Arthur says they'd been under only five minutes when it felt like hours. Cobb explains that the mind functions faster in a dream, so time moves slower. They go under again and Ariadne is given the opportunity to creatively alter the physics of the dream. Her architectural wonders cause the people in the dream - projections of Cobb's subconscious - to search for the intruder - Ariadne - like white blood cells drawn to a virus. When Ariadne makes the mistake of creating a bridge from her memories, Cobb recognizes it and his subconscious reacts as a mob, separating Ariadne from Cobb until Mal appears and stabs her.She wakes up and Cobb rushes to the restroom while Arthur explains that Cobb's subconscious became aware of her as an invasive being and she was unable to wake up right away because there was still time on the clock. The only way for her to wake up was if she died. Cobb takes out his top and spins it, sighing as it topples over. Ariadne leaves the warehouse, angry and refusing to open her mind to Cobb if his subconscious is as tormented as it seems. Cobb returns to the room and assures Arthur that she'll be back but he needs to make a trip to Mombasa to recruit an old friend to the team. He finds Eames (Tom Hardy) gambling at a bar and offers him a place on his team as a forger/imitator. Eames agrees before telling Cobb he's being tailed, pointing to two men at the bar. Cobb recognizes them as Cobol thugs who must be aiming to collect the bounty on his head for the botched Saito job. Eames creates a distraction while Cobb escapes, leading the thugs on a chaotic chase through the city streets. At the last moment, Saito pulls up in a limousine and picks up first Cobb, then Eames. He explains that he's been tracing Cobb to protect his investment.Eames takes them to a local chemist he knows who experiments with Somnacin and who might be an asset to their team. Yusuf (Dileep Rao) listens as Cobb explains that his job may require the use of a three-layered dream. Yusuf says that this would be otherwise impossible, due to the instability of dreams the further down you go, if not for a special solution he's concocted with a powerful sedative. To show its effectiveness, Yusuf takes them downstairs where they see dozens of men sleeping under the watch of an old man (Earl Cameron). He tells Cobb that these men come here to 'wake up'; dreaming has become their reality. With the aid of the sedative, their sleep is deep and stable and they are able to dream for what feels to them like years. Cobb tries the sedative himself and is impressed with its affects, though shaken after waking from a vivid dream with Mal. He convinces Yusuf to join his team.Meanwhile, Ariadne returns to the workshop where she tells Arthur that she meant to stay away but couldn't resist the pure creation involved in architectural dreaming. Arthur takes her into a dream and introduces the notion of creating paradoxes, such as the Penrose steps. He also reveals that Mal was Cobb's wife and has since passed away. Despite Mal's malevolent nature within the dreams - her existence now only as a projection of Cobb's - Arthur tells Ariadne she was lovely in real life.The team bands together and decides that they will create a three-level dream with the third level containing the planted idea. The target in mind is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the CEO and heir of Fischer Morrow, whose father, Maurice (Pete Postlethwaite), is slowly decaying with illness. Eames targets Robert's godfather and business partner, Peter Browning (Tom Berenger), to get a better grasp on the father-son dynamic and to use his imitation skills at their best. The team decides that, in order to get Robert to split up his father's company and because of their complicated relationship, a positive idea will trump a negative one; 'my father wants me to be my own man.' Saito oversees most of the plans and, because he wants full verification of any success or failure, decides that he will accompany the team into the dreams as a 'tourist'.As the team prepares over the next few weeks, Arthur shows Ariadne the significance of 'totems'; small, personal objects that enable a person to differentiate between dreams and reality. Cobb's totem is his top, which topples over in the real world and keeps spinning in a dream. Arthur's is a loaded die and he instructs Ariadne to create one for herself that only she can touch to ensure its validity. She creates a semi-hollowed bishop chess piece as her totem. Wanting as much time as possible to complete the job, the team decides, with Saito's help, that they will perform the job on a Boeing 747 during an international flight from Europe to Los Angeles, a 10 hour flight. This will give them a week in the first stage of the dreams. Saito reveals that he's bought the entire airline, making the job neater and without having to buy out certain sections of the plane for access.One evening, after a day of formulating plans, Ariadne finds Cobb dreaming alone in the workshop. Curious, she hooks herself up to his machine and finds herself descending in an elevator. She sees Cobb sitting in a living room with Mal who quickly detects Ariadne's presence. Cobb gets up and joins Ariadne in the elevator, leading her through some of the levels that Ariadne discovers are each specific memories; something he originally told her never to do. Horrified after seeing Cobb's torment over leaving home without saying farewell to his children, Ariadne takes the elevator alone to the last level where she sees a hotel room, the contents of which are strewn on the floor. She steps on some broken glass and Mal looks up from the couch, asking what she's doing here. Ariadne tries to explain that she just wants to understand but Mal becomes defensive and picks up a shard of glass. Cobb arrives and takes Ariadne back to the elevator as Mal rushes forward, shouting at Cobb that he didn't keep his promise.Ariadne and Cobb exit the dream and Cobb explains that the reason he can't go home is because of Mal's death, because it was thought that he killed her. He thanks Ariadne when she doesn't ask him if he did or not but she does warn him that he's mistaken if he thinks he can cage Mal like that. He needs to release his guilt over her death. Ariadne convinces Cobb to allow her to go with the team into the dreams because he needs someone who understands what he's going through. At that moment, Saito and Arthur arrive and announce that Maurice Fischer has died and Robert will be accompanying the body to the States in a few days.The team boards the flight and sits with Robert in a sectioned-off first class cabin. Cobb returns Robert's passport, pick-pocketed by Arthur, as a conversation starter and then drugs his water before proposing a toast in his father's honor. Within moments, Robert is asleep and the paid-off flight attendant (Miranda Nolan) assists setting up and activating the PASIV device. All together, the team descends into, first, Yusuf's dream. It is raining heavily in New York City as members of the team are picked up. Arthur and Saito commandeer a taxi, pick up Robert and Eames and then Yusuf as Saito holds a gun to Robert as part of the kidnap ruse. Cobb and Ariadne follow in a separate car until a train suddenly barges down the middle of the street, hitting their car and temporarily stalling them. Gunfire then opens on the taxi and the team is forced to take immediate evasive maneuvers, hiding out in a warehouse where its discovered that Saito has been shot in the chest.Robert is taken into another room while Saito is laid on a table. Before Eames can shoot him to end his misery and wake him up, Cobb stops him and explains that, due to the sedatives they've taken, they won't wake up if they die. Instead, they'll be sent to limbo; a shared dream-state of raw subconscious where time is practically non-existent. The team is angered by this, wondering why they've taken such a risk, as they contemplate what to do about the armed forces closing in on their location. They find out that Robert's subconscious has been trained to fight against extraction and the projections attacking them are part of that defense. With Saito's condition deteriorating and unable to wait much longer due to the approaching defense projections, the team decides they need to complete the job as quickly as possible.Ariadne confronts Cobb about the control he has over his own subconscious and he confesses that he can't keep Mal out of his head. He tells her that they had been experimenting with dream states and wanted to see how far down they could go into their subconscious. They wound up in limbo together, unable to leave because of the time remaining on their PASIV clock. They recreated their lives, spending years worth of building. After so long, they began to perceive limbo as their reality. After something like 50 years, Cobb and Mal killed themselves on train tracks to bring them back to reality. Despite returning to the real world, Mal continued to believe that she was still dreaming and believed that dying was the only way to 'wake up', but she refused to leave without Cobb; she loved him too much. On their wedding anniversary, Cobb went to the hotel room they always stayed in to find it trashed and the window open. Outside, on an opposite ledge, sat Mal who revealed to Cobb that she filed a letter to their attorney expressing a fear for her life, effectively framing him in the event of her death and forcing him no other way than to join her. Cobb refuses to jump and attempts to bring Mal to her senses, but she ignores him and jumps to her death. Since she declared herself legally sane by three psychiatrists, Cobb's case for his innocence is overruled by the outstanding evidence against him. With no other choice, Cobb leaves his children behind with their grandmother and flees the country.Ariadne tries to convince Cobb that Mal's death was not his fault and that he needs to focus on the mission. Eames prepares himself as an impersonation of Browning while Cobb and Arthur interrogate Robert, demanding to know the combination to his father's safe. They pressure Robert by using 'Browning' as leverage. Eames shouts from another room as if being beaten before he is brought into the room with Robert to try and get him to remember. He tells Robert that the safe contains an alternate version of his father's will, one that will dissolve the company if Robert chooses so. 'Browning' tells Robert that his father loved him and wanted him to build something of his own. As Robert's defenses close in on the warehouse, Robert reveals that one word he could decipher out of his father's last words was 'disappointed', convincing him that his father didn't love him.With the warehouse in danger of being infiltrated, the team pressure Robert once again for a combination. He tells them a series of random numbers that come to mind before they load him into a van and drug him to sleep. They all get in and prepare to enter the second level of the dream while Yusuf drives the van away from the pursuing projections.In Arthur's dream, Cobb resolves to use 'Mr. Charles', a method in which he introduces the subject to the fact that he's dreaming in order to garner trust. He meets Robert at a bar and tells him that he is there to protect him and someone is trying to access his mind. He convinces Robert that he's dreaming by introducing the strangeness of their surroundings and calms Robert to control them. He helps Robert remember that he's been kidnapped and leads him to a hotel room (the first few numbers of which match the first digits Robert thought of for the combination) where the rest of the team regroups. Saito is in better health in this level of the dream, but soon begins coughing. When Robert's projection on Browning arrives, Cobb convinces Robert that it was Browning who kidnapped him by asking if he saw Browning being tortured by the kidnappers in his previous sleep level. Browning confesses that he was responsible for the kidnapping, as the second testament left to Robert allowed him to destroy his father's empire, which Browning could not let him do it. Cobb suggests to Robert that they enter Browning's dreams to figure out what was really in the safe so that Robert can decide for himself. Robert agrees, now unknowingly assisting in his own inception and the team is hooked up again, this time with Arthur remaining behind to watch over them and administer a synchronized kick when its time.As the team goes into the third dream, in actuality Robert's, Arthur is forced to fight off more of Robert's defensive projections while in the first dream Yusuf continues to drive the van. The third dream is set in snow covered mountains where Robert's safe is heavily guarded in a mountainside fort. The team splits up to draw the guards away. Cobb goes with Ariadne, Eames travels alone to ward off the guards, and Robert and Saito begin ascending a mountainside to access a blind side of the fort.Meanwhile, Yusuf momentarily loses control of the van and it tumbles down an incline, the tumbling effect translates into Arthur's dream as he fights off Robert's projections, the environment around him spinning as gravity reverses and then rights itself. As Yusuf continues driving, he becomes cornered on an elevated bridge with one car full of projections stuck with him. Yusuf plays music through Arthur's headphones to warn him of the incoming kick before driving backwards off the bridge. Upon impact, the force sends Arthur in his dream flying and, as the van plummets in mid air, there is a loss of gravity in Arthur's dream. The impact also translates into the third level of the dream. Saito and Robert look up the mountainside and are forced to cut their lines as an avalanche sweeps down upon them. Cobb realizes they've missed the first kick, but they still have time for the second one when the van hits the water off the bridge.Van drives off the bridge: 10 seconds left to impact.Dream 2: 3 minutes to synchronize the kick. Arthur struggles with a way to do this without gravity.Dream 3: 60 minutes left.With little time left, Cobb demands to know if there is another way into the fort and Ariadne relents into telling him of a secret underground entrance that Robert and Saito can access. Cobb send them there, all while Saito's condition deteriorates. They finally enter the main room where the safe is located while Cobb and Ariadne watch from a snipers angle. Succumbing to his injuries, Saito is left to lay down, coughing blood as Robert continues forward. However, as Robert comes into Cobb's view, so does another person. Mal drops in from the ceiling and shoots Robert down before Cobb comes to his senses and shoots her. Eames is ordered to the room as Cobb and Ariadne rush to the site. Finding Robert dead, Cobb labels the mission a failure, since the only other place where Robert has gone is limbo. Ariadne, however, convinces him that, if they go into limbo, they'll have enough time to find Robert and bring him back. Eames agrees to use a defibrillator to jump start Roberts heart to help while Cobb and Ariadne go under.Meanwhile, in dream level 2, Arthur devises a unique plan. He uses phone wires to tie the team together and brings them into the elevator. He lines the outside of the car with explosives, timing down till the kick with the intention of using explosive force to create gravity and instigating a kick.In limbo, Cobb and Ariadne tour the deteriorating world that he and Mal once built. They see old homes and buildings before they find the one where Cobb knows Mal must be. If they find Mal, they'll find Robert because Mal will want to use something Cobb wants to bring him to her. Sure enough, they enter the apartment and Mal is waiting for them. She tries, again, to convince Cobb that his place is with her in their real home with their children but Cobb reveals a terrible truth, the reason why Mal believed that her dreams were real.While they were in limbo, Mal had stored away a truth that she didn't want to believe anymore; her totem, placed within her safe, lying on its side, immobile; telling her that her dream, her limbo, was reality. In an effort to save her mind, Cobb broke into her safe and spun the top to convince her that this world was not real. However, he did not know that, once they really woke up, she would continue to believe that. This was how he knew inception would work; because he performed it on Mal first and his guilt over her subsequent death has been plaguing him ever since. He tells Mal that he will stay with her in limbo if she tells him where Robert is and she reveals he's on the porch. Ariadne finds him there and pushes him off as an improvised kick.Robert comes back to life in dream level 3 with Eames' aid and opens his own safe, finding within an image of his bed-stricken father muttering his last word. Robert acknowledges that his father was disappointed that he couldn't be him, but Maurice says, ""No...no. I was disappointed that you tried."" Maurice then points to a cabinet where Robert finds the will...and a paper fan his father made for him once as a child. Tearfully, Robert looks up to see his father has passed and breaks down as the van hits the water.Dream 2, Arthur hits the detonator and the explosives force the elevator down, creating artificial gravity on the team.Dream 3, a series of explosions set by Eames rock the fort, collapsing the main floor.In limbo, the synchronization of kicks pulls on Ariadne and she calls for Cobb to join her. Cobb says that he will stay in limbo, but not with Mal. By this time, Saito has died and joined limbo as well. Cobb must find him but promises to return. Ariadne leaps off the side of the building and rides the kicks back to dream 1. In the van, Robert wakes up and escapes the submerged van with 'Browning'. Arthur and Ariadne share an oxygen tank with Yusuf before they escape the van, leaving Cobb.Robert and 'Browning' make it to shore where Robert reveals that his father really did want him to be his own man and that he's going to do just that and liquidate his father's company. Knowing the mission is a success, Eames drops the Browning mask.In limbo, Cobb washes ashore where the armed guard finds him. He is brought to the seaside palace where the elderly Japanese man recognizes his brass top. Cobb recalls what he was there to do and calls to Saito, asking him to come back with him and honor their arrangement. The elderly Saito reaches for Cobb's gun.Cobb wakes up on the airplane and looks around, startled, to see Arthur and Ariadne smiling at him. He looks at the now awake Saito who remembers, picking up his phone and dials. The plane lands in Los Angeles and Cobb nervously moves through customs where security checks his passport, but allows him passage through, welcoming him home. Cobb walks past the rest of the team and Robert, who pauses a moment as if recalling a half-remembered dream. Ahead of him, Cobb sees Miles calling him over. They drive home together where Cobb hesitates before taking out his brass top. He spins it on the table in the kitchen as his children appear at the back door. He runs to them, elated to see their faces again as the top continues to spin, wobbles a bit...and the screen turns to black.The very last moment of the film is a little more complex than indicated by the current synopsis (see above): ""...the top continues to spin, wobbles a bit.."" which indicates that Cobb has returned to reality. The actual script, by Christopher Nolan, differs from this. The script ends withBehind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we-FADE OUT.CREDITS.END.My feeling is that the author wished us to see Cobb as failing, which is in line with the rest of the film-everyone dying or hurting; nothing positive, really, except for Cobb's hopes. However, I also think that the director or producer wanted to leave the ending ambiguous, so that optimists would see a positive ending, and cynics would see something more pessimistic.

The description of the movie's end above doesn't fully explain the final scene. Then it appears someone edited it by adding their subjective *interpretation* of the ending.
So to clarify, here's what (objectively, without interpretation) happens: Cobb enters his home and spins the top on the kitchen table as his children appear at the back door. He immediately goes to them, elated to see them, they all hug, the kids start telling him stories of what he missed while he was gone, he replies the way good parents do - showing he's enthusiastic, fully focused on them, etc and they all start to walk away (from the top). We continue to hear their chatter in the background as the video and audio focus in on the spinning top. It continues to spin. It wobbles just a little - just enough to leave the viewer wondering whether it's going to keep spinning or not. End movie.
[My subjective interpretation: it's left to the viewer to decide whether it keeps spinning or it falls. But the real point is that Cobb no longer cares.]"
Despicable Me,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323594/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a criminal mastermind uses a trio of orphan girls as pawns for a grand scheme, he finds their love is profoundly changing him for the better. In a happy suburban neighborhood surrounded by white picket fences with flowering rose bushes, sits a black house with a dead lawn. Unbeknownst to the neighbors, hidden beneath this house is a vast secret hideout. Surrounded by a small army of minions, we discover Gru (Steve Carell), planning the biggest heist in the history of the world. He is going to steal the moon. Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad. The world's greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher).—Universal Pictures Having a flair for high-profile crime, Gru, humankind's undisputed public enemy number one and history's most despicable supervillain, finds himself with his back to the wall when cunning arch-rival Vector manages to outshine him. Now only an outrageously ambitious plan involving the snatching of the moon, three adorable cookie-selling sisters, and the devastating Shrink-Ray gun can help Gru earn a place in the pantheon of mega-criminals. However, teaching Vector a lesson is never a walk in the park. Can Gru, the sweet scoundrel with a heart of gold, meet the challenge?—Nick Riganas A villain who has everything that he has ever wanted makes the decision to adopt three young females for a heist. Along the way, he learns the true meaning of being a fun role model for them. He makes sure that they stay around with him and become a family.—RECB3 The film begins with the news revealing that an Egyptian pyramid was stolen. When super-villain Gru (Steve Carell) hears of this, his pride is wounded and he plans to pull the biggest heist of the century by stealing the Moon.Gru tries to get a loan from the Bank of Evil (Formerly Lehman Brothers) and meets a young super-villain, Vector (Jason Segel), who annoys him. Bank president Mr. Perkins (Will Arnett) refuses to grant Gru the loan until he obtains the shrink ray necessary for the plan. Mr. Perkins tells Gru that he is getting too old and that new super-villains are younger and better, like Vector, who is revealed to be the one who stole the Pyramid of Giza.Gru and his minions steal the shrink ray from a top secret research facility in East Asia, but Vector steals it from him and shrinks his ship. Gru attempts to get the shrink ray back from Vector's lair, but all his attempts to enter the lair prove futile. After seeing three orphaned girls, Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) enter the lair to sell cookies to Vector. Gru adopts the girls from Miss Hattie (Kristen Wiig), the head of the orphanage, to use them to steal back the shrink ray. Gru has his assistant Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) build robots disguised as cookies. He then has the girls sell the robots to Vector, and the robots help Gru steal the shrink ray.On the way home the girls ask to go to an amusement park. Gru agrees, intending to leave the girls there. Instead, the attendant says he, as an adult, has to ride the roller coaster with them. Gru ends up having fun with the girls. Back at home, he presents his plan to Mr. Perkins via video. The girls keep interrupting him. Perkins again refuses to give him the loan, claiming that although he doesn't have a problem with the plan, he just wants a younger villain to do it instead. Gru has a flashback of his childhood, depicting his wanting to go to the moon after seeing the first moon landing. When he tried to impress his mother (Julie Andrews) with models of the rocket (and an actual working one), she just ignored him. Mr. Perkins calls Vector (revealed to be his son, whose real name is Victor) to the Bank of Evil to inform him that Gru has the shrink ray. Vector reassures his father that he will get the Moon. Gru almost abandons his plan due to lack of funds, but the girls and the minions take up a collection to keep it going.However, Gru has to make a choice, because the moon will be in the optimal position for the heist on the same day as the girls' ballet recital. Dr. Nefario, seeing the girls as a distraction, contacts Miss Hattie, who arrives to take the girls back. Gru, the Minions, and the girls are heartbroken. Gru goes on with his plan and flies to the moon.Gru successfully shrinks and pockets the Moon. Gru remembers the ballet recital and rushes to it. However, it has ended by the time he arrived. There, he finds a ransom note from Vector demanding the moon in exchange for the girls. After Gru hands over the moon, Vector reneges on the deal, keeping the girls and the moon. This enrages Gru, who storms Vector's lair, this time successfully breaching the defenses. Vector flies off in an escape pod with the girls. Gru holds on to the exterior of the ship. He nearly falls to his death, but is rescued by Dr. Nefario piloting the same ship that Vector shrunk before. Nefario reveals that the bigger the object, the quicker the effects of the shrink ray wear off. Very soon, the moon begins to grow and roll around inside Vector's ship, hurting him and freeing the girls. The girls see Gru outside of the ship, and Gru tells them to jump over to him. Edith and Agnes successfully make it onto the ship, but before Margo can jump, Vector grabs her. The moon rolls again and knocks Vector over, and Margo grabs onto Gru's grappling hook. Gru rescues her with the help of his minions, while the rapidly-expanding Moon wrecks Vector's controls, causing his ship to carry it back into orbit.Gru and the girls settle down to live a happy life as a family and Vector is stranded on the Moon. The girls give a special ballet recital for Gru, his minions, and his mother, who finally tells him she is proud of him and acknowledges him to be the better parent.

How to Train Your Dragon,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892769/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hapless young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed. Long ago up North on the Island of Berk, the young Viking, Hiccup, wants to join his town's fight against the dragons that continually raid their town. However, his macho father and village leader, Stoik the Vast, will not allow his small, clumsy, but inventive son to do so. Regardless, Hiccup ventures out into battle and downs a mysterious Night Fury dragon with his invention, but can't bring himself to kill it. Instead, Hiccup and the dragon, whom he dubs Toothless, begin a friendship that would open up both their worlds as the observant boy learns that his people have misjudged the species. But even as the two each take flight in their own way, they find that they must fight the destructive ignorance plaguing their world.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In a world with dragons, this movie takes place on the island of Berk. Hiccup, son of Stoik, wants to be a dragon killer like his dad, but his dad refuses. One night on an invasion of the dragons, Hiccup catches a Night Fury, the rarest and an unseen dragon of them all to prove to his father he is worthy. But while his father is away to find the nest of the dragons, he allows Hiccup to start training to kill dragons, and at the same time, Hiccup trains with with his newly found dragon Toothless since when he was caught, lost a part of his tail. But while Hiccup tries to persuade the other vikings that the dragons are good not bad, they have a hard time believing so.—James Hake On the fantastical island of Berk, Hiccup is an awkward 15-year old kid, living in the shadow of his Viking Chief of a father. In order to cement his manhood and earn the respect of his fellow vikings, Hiccup must tackle the tough task of capturing a dragon. During one of the village's battles, Hiccup believes he sees a Night Fury, one of the most elusive dragons on the island, and shoots it down. Curious to identify his shot, Hiccup goes looking for and indeed finds the dragon, albeit trapped in his bolas in a forest. Little does Hiccup realize the unlikely friendship, and discovery about the dragon species, that lies before him.—Kyle Perez In the small Viking village of Berk, where humans and mysterious creatures of lore coexist, Hiccup, a bright-eyed teenager trying to fit in, wants to prove his worth and follow his tribe's long-standing tradition: become a dragon slayer. However, as scrawny Hiccup captures an elusive Night Fury, the rarest dragon of all, something unprecedented happens. But what if the prejudice-defying secret came to light? Will the Vikings realise dragons aren't what they have always believed, or brand Hiccup a traitorous, dragon-loving pariah?—Nick Riganas A Viking boy called Hiccup (voice:Jay Baruchel) introduces his village of Berk (""it's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new""). The village is attacked by dragons, who steal food (mostly sheep) and set things on fire (hence all the new buildings). The villagers grab weapons and try to fight the dragons off. Despite being told by every adult in sight to go indoors, Hiccup hauls out a bolas-shooting cannon he made himself and shoots a dragon out of the night sky. (As assistant to the village blacksmith, Gobber (voice:Craig Ferguson), Hiccup has access to tools and materials and knows how to use them.) The dragon lands in the woods some distance form the village and no one believes that he hit anything, so it's the next day before Hiccup can go looking for it. It turns out to be a rare and deadly Night Fury, but Hiccup can't make himself kill it. Instead he releases it -- whereupon it also refrains from killing Hiccup -- and it flies off through the trees.Hiccup discovers that the dragon (which he eventually calls Toothless because of its retractable teeth) has holed up in a steep-sided valley because it can no longer fly more than a few feet at a time. While sketching the dragon, Hiccup realizes that it's missing a tail fin. He makes a prosthetic tail fin out of leather. The new fin helps, but Toothless can't control it and inadvertently takes Hiccup for a ride, giving him a clear idea of what's needed to help the dragon fly right. In a series of workshop and test flight scenes, Hiccup builds and perfects a saddle, a control mechanism for the tail fin, and a safety harness.Meanwhile, Hiccup's father Stoick (voice:Gerard Butler) has signed him up for dragon training with Gobber, which is very different from the training he's already doing with Toothless: he's going to learn to fight dragons. At first, he's the worst student in the class. Since Hiccup has always been an accident-prone klutz, this comes as no surprise to his classmates Astrid (voice:America Ferrera), Snotlout (voice:Jonah Hill), Fishlegs (voice:Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Ruffnut (voice:Kristen Wiig), and her twin brother Tuffnut (voice:T.J. Miller). (Hiccup's a little sweet on Astrid.) Before long, Hiccup is able to use some things he's learned while working with Toothless to soothe and manage the school's practice dragons. (It turns out dragons are just big kitty-cats: they like to be petted, there's a kind of grass that's like cat-nip to them, and they love fish (but hate eels).) When Stoick returns from a failed search for the fabled nest of the dragons, he's surprised but thrilled to hear that his son is doing brilliantly at dragon training. He gives Hiccup a horned helmet made from one of his dead mother's breastplates. But Hiccup, as usual, is unable to get around his father's expectations and speak frankly, so he can't explain that his success at dragon school is unlikely to lead to the slaying of any dragons.When Hiccup subdues a practice dragon, unintentionally earning the privilege of killing it before the entire village, he's horrified and decides to flee with Toothless. However Astrid, having noticed Hiccup's frequent disappearances and secretive behavior, is suspicious. She follows him to the hidden valley and sees Toothless. Unable to explain his relationship with the dragon, Hiccup takes her flying, and she's captivated. But they get caught up in a flock of dragons returning to their nest carrying food. The dragons fly inside a mountainous island and drop the food into a pit, which turns out to contain a huge, terrifying, and very hungry dragon that eats the smaller ones if they don't bring it enough food. Hiccup and Astrid and shocked to realize that the dragons have been stealing their sheep to keep from being eaten themselves. When they get home, Hiccup convinces Astrid not to reveal the location of the dragon nest. Before she goes, she punches him in the arm and says ""That's for kidnapping me."" Then she kisses him and says ""That's for everything else.""Everything goes wrong at the dragon-killing ceremony. Hiccup discards his weapons in an attempt to show the Vikings that dragons only fight to defend themselves, but Stoick and others intervene and the dragon attacks. Toothless comes to the rescue and is on the verge of killing Stoick when Hiccup calls Toothless off. Despite Hiccup's protests, the angry Vikings chain Toothless up. When he ineptly tries to explain, Hiccup lets it slip that Toothless took him to the nest of the dragons, and Stoick resolves to use Toothless to find the nest again. He won't listen to Hiccup's warnings about the giant dragon. He loads Toothless on his ship and the Viking fleet sails off with all the warriors in the village, disowning Hiccup and leaving him behind. When Hiccup wonders aloud why he didn't kill Toothless when he had the chance since it would have avoided all of this, Astrid challenges him to explain why. In doing so, Hiccup comes to an epiphany about his moral character, his personal strength and Astrid's faith in him. Inspired, Hiccup and his classmates mount the practice dragons and fly off in pursuit of the fleet.At the dragons' island, the Vikings use catapults to break open the side of the mountain in which the giant dragon is trapped. When it comes out, Stoick realizes that he's made a mistake. He resolves to fight it himself to buy the other Vikings time to escape; Gobber volunteers to join him. While Stoick and Gobber prepare to sacrifice themselves to distract the dragon, the kids arrive to join the battle. They do manage to distract the giant dragon a little, but it sets the Vikings' ships on fire. While his comrades keep the giant dragon occupied, Hiccup tries to rescue Toothless (who's still in chains) from the burning ship, but they end up under water and Stoick rescues both of them. Then Toothless and Hiccup go after the giant dragon together. They draw it up into the clouds and away from the Vikings, trying to get it to crash on the island. In the end Toothless releases a blast into the giant dragon's open mouth and it crashes and burns, apparently taking our heroes down with it -- we see Hiccup fall toward the fire as Toothless tries desperately to catch him. On the ground, a heartbroken Stoick approaches the wounded Toothless wondering what has become of his son; Toothless opens his wings to show that he saved Hiccup. (""Well, most of him,"" Gobber remarks cryptically.)Back at home, Hiccup wakes up and Toothless urges him out of bed. Hiccup finds that he lost his left foot in the battle with the giant dragon. However, Gobber has made him a new one, ingeniously spring-loaded. (Hiccup and Toothless now have matching disabilities.) They go out into the village, which is full of swooping, frolicking dragons; the Vikings now treat them as pets. Astrid greets Hiccup with a kiss. Supplied by Gobber with a new tail fin prosthetic and saddle for Toothless, Hiccup takes flight with Astrid and his friends as he exults at the new alliance of Vikings and Dragons."
Tangled,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The magically long-haired Rapunzel has spent her entire life in a tower, but now that a runaway thief has stumbled upon her, she is about to discover the world for the first time, and who she really is. After receiving the healing powers from a magical flower, the baby Princess Rapunzel is kidnapped from the palace in the middle of the night by Mother Gothel. Mother Gothel knows that the flower's magical powers are now growing within the golden hair of Rapunzel, and to stay young, she must lock Rapunzel in her hidden tower. Rapunzel is now a teenager and her hair has grown to a length of 70-feet. The beautiful Rapunzel has been in the tower her entire life, and she is curious of the outside world. One day, the bandit Flynn Ryder scales the tower and is taken captive by Rapunzel. Rapunzel strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. Rapunzel is about to have the most exciting and magnificent journey of her life.—Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) A long-lost princess with the longest hair imaginable named Rapunzel has spent her whole life in a lonely tower, dreaming of the world, waiting to discover it. When she finally starts to give up hope an escaped prisoner named Flynn Rider approaches Rapunzel's lonely tower and agrees to take her to see the lanterns that appear every day on her birthday if she would return his satchel filled with stolen jewels, including the lost princess's shiny crown. Flynn and Rapunzel embark on a journey that they will never forget and Rapunzel discovers who she really is. Childless witch Gothel kidnapped baby princess Rapunzel to raise as her own daughter, locked in a tower to preserve the youth provided by a magically healing flower in her hair, that is still never cut when she grows up as a teenager. Running from both foresters and fellow poachers, lovable bandit Flynn Rider seeks refuge in the tower. After knocking him out in fear, she teams up with Flynn to explore the world she never saw and steal enough jewels to fill his satchel, bonding during the adventure.—KGF Vissers A young female has been kidnapped and locked inside of a tower for most of her life. After accidentally meeting a young male, she has the opportunity to experience what the world has to offer. Along the journey, she discovers the truth about who she really is.—RECB3 The film opens on a Wanted poster for Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) which is mounted to a tree. Flynn's voice narrates: ""This is the story of how I died. But don't worry, this is actually a fun story and the truth is it isn't even mine. This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel, and it starts with the sun.""Centuries ago, a droplet of sunlight falls from the sky and lands on Earth. When it touches the ground, a radiant, yellow flower blossoms. This flower is said to be capable of great healing power. One day, an old crone named Gothel (Donna Murphy) finds the flower and discovers that, when she sings a certain song to it (""Flower, gleam and glow. Let your power shine. Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine, what once was mine""), it emits a power that restores her youth. Vain and possessive of the flower, Gothel hides it beneath a woven basket and regularly returns to it to keep herself young.Time goes by and soon a prosperous kingdom is built up nearby. The ruling king and queen of Corona desperately wish for a child and, when the queen finally becomes pregnant, the entire kingdom celebrates. However, the queen soon falls deathly ill. Upon hearing a rumor that speaks of the legendary sun flower, the king spares no time and dispatches his soldiers to find it. Soon enough, the soldiers discover the flower that, in her haste to hide, Gothel forgot to cover. They bring it back to the castle and distill it into an elixir which is given to the queen. To everyone's great relief, she recovers and soon gives birth to a beautiful baby girl who, unlike her brunette parents, has shining golden hair. The royal family marks the occasion by lighting a paper lantern decorated with the emblem of a sun and release it into the sky.Gothel, however, is not pleased. She is determined not to lose the magical powers that gave her eternal youth, so she breaks into the castle late one night and finds the baby princess lying in her crib. She recites the old song and the baby's hair glows just as the flower had. Gothel attempts to cut just enough hair to keep but the clipped hair turns brown in her hands, void of its power. Desperate, Gothel resolves to kidnap the princess and flee with her deep into the forest. She takes the baby to a secret tower hidden in an alcove where she gives her the name Rapunzel and raises her as her own daughter. She teaches the girl to sing the old song to make her hair glow and restore Gothel's beauty and keeps her hidden from the world, telling her that it is for her own safety and that anyone on the outside wouldn't hesitate to steal her magic hair. The only access to the world Rapunzel has is a wide window from which Mother Gothel comes and goes, using Rapunzel's 70 foot long hair as a rope ladder. Despite playing the part as 'mother', Gothel often cruelly teases Rapunzel and guilt-trips her whenever she is upset or disappointed, dramatically proclaiming, ""now I'm the bad guy"".As the years pass, Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) becomes fascinated by an annual event that seems to happen only on her birthday. That night, every year, she witnesses thousands of floating lights in the sky, brighter than the stars and beautiful in all their colors. Unknown to her, it is the releasing of the paper lanterns that her biological parents are making in tradition of their daughter who they hope will return to them one day. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel is a creative young woman, finding numerous ways to keep herself entertained during the day while Mother Gothel is away, including painting, cleaning, brushing, and playing hide and seek with her pet chameleon Pascal. Though she is happy with her life in the tower, she longs to someday explore the outside world and see the place where the lanterns in the sky come from.Within the kingdom, standing on the roof of the castle, young thief Flynn Rider goes over the plans to his latest heist with his associates, the Stabbington brothers (Ron Perlman). They use a rope to lower Flynn into the throne room where the missing princess's prized tiara sits on a guarded pedestal. Flynn steals the priceless artifact and is hoisted back to the roof with the palace guards hot in pursuit, led by the Captain of the Guard (M.C. Gainey) and his loyal horse, Maximus. The thieves make it outside the kingdom and seek refuge in the forest but soon come to a dead end in a ditch. The Stabbington brothers tell Flynn that, if he gives them the satchel with the tiara in it, they'll hoist him up to the high ledge above. Once at the top, they then command that Flynn help them up. But Flynn reveals that he still has the tiara in a second satchel. Double crossing the brothers, he ditches them and runs into the forest.Seeking refuge, Flynn comes to Rapunzel's tower and climbs the vines to the open window above. Seemingly alone, he takes the tiara out of his satchel to admire it, but Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan. She and Pascal step forward cautiously to investigate the intruder. Pascal, using his color schemes, advises Rapunzel to be wary of the young man since Gothel has often told stories of men bearing sharp teeth. However, Rapunzel finds nothing outwardly menacing about Flynn and hides him in her closet as Mother Gothel comes home. Rapunzel decides that she will show Mother Gothel the young man, proving that she can take care of herself, in hopes that she will be let out of the tower for her approaching 18th birthday. However, when Rapunzel plucks up the courage to ask to leave the tower and see the floating lights, Mother Gothel spurns her request. She tells Rapunzel that the world is much too dangerous for someone as naïve as her and that she is never to leave the tower, singing that ""Mother Knows Best"".Rapunzel solemnly promises not to ask to leave the tower again and, thinking it pointless now, keeps from telling Mother Gothel that she has a stranger locked away in her closet. Instead, she asks if Mother Gothel could restore her white paint by collecting special white seashells for her birthday. Mother Gothel is hesitant about making the three day journey to the shore, but acquiesces and leaves. Once out of sight, Rapunzel takes Flynn out of the closet and uses her hair to tie him up to a chair. When he comes to, she proposes a deal. She will give him his satchel with the tiara back (which she has hidden) if he takes her to see the floating lights and brings her back to the tower before Mother Gothel returns. Flynn reluctantly agrees.Outside the tower, Rapunzel digs her toes into grass for the first time and runs about the forest in bursts of elation and panic while Flynn can only watch. While excited to be out in the world for the first time, Rapunzel feels equally ashamed for having defied her mother. Despite her guilt and confusion, she assures Flynn that she is fine enough to continue the journey. Hoping to dissuade her, Flynn takes her to the nearby Snuggly Duckling Inn, a tavern which is frequented by an assortment of thugs and bandits. Flynn's plan to scare Rapunzel into going back to the tower backfires when the thugs recognize him from wanted posters and attempt to hold him for a reward while one of their associates goes to tip off the guards. Rapunzel pleads with them to release Flynn and asks if any of them have ever had a dream. Her innocence melts their hearts and they all confess their dreams. When the guards arrive at the inn, they stage a distraction to help Rapunzel and Flynn escape through a secret tunnel and encourage her to live her dream.As they make their way down the tunnel, the horse Maximus arrives at the inn and sniffs Flynn's trail to the secret trapdoor. He leads the guards to a large quarry where they corner Rapunzel and Flynn. Maximus unhinges a large wooden beam to try and get to them but this renders the dam overlooking the quarry unstable. It collapses and a wave of water surges into the quarry. Rapunzel and Flynn become trapped inside a cave as falling rocks block the entrance. Water begins to flood into the cave and, realizing their doom, Rapunzel and Flynn each admit a secret to the other. Flynn confesses that his true name is Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel tells him that her hair glows when she sings. However, she realizes that she can use that to her advantage and begins singing. Her glowing hair illuminates a break in the rocks where water flows out and Flynn manages to dislodge the rocks, injuring his hand slightly, and break out the other side.Meanwhile, Maximus the horse jumps out in front of Mother Gothel startling her, she immediately panics that his rider (a palace guard) has located Rapunzel and rescued her. She is shocked to discover Rapunzel gone and even more surprised when she finds the tiara hidden under the staircase with a satchel and a wanted poster of Flynn. Bent on retrieving Rapunzel, Gothel takes the satchel and tiara and sets out to search for her. She manages to track Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, through the secret passage, into the quarry, and through the cave into the forest once more. There, she is confronted by the Stabbington brothers, but uses them to her advantage by bargaining their help for the tiara, revenge against Flynn for double-crossing them, and 'something worth much more'.That evening, Rapunzel and Eugene set up camp and Rapunzel reveals to Eugene that her hair does not just glow as she wraps it around his injured hand. She sings and, as her hair glows, it heals Eugene's injury, to his shock. He asks her not to spread word of his true name for fear that it would ruin his reputation, explaining that he adopted his current pseudonym of 'Flynn Rider' as an orphan, inspired by stories of a thief named 'Flynn'. Growing up, he dreamed of having enough money to travel the world and relished the freedom of it all. Even so, Rapunzel tells him that she actually prefers his real name.When Eugene leaves to gather more firewood, Mother Gothel appears to Rapunzel from the nearby bushes and tells her that they must return to the tower. Rapunzel refuses to leave and tells Mother Gothel that she thinks Eugene likes her. Mother Gothel scoffs at the idea and tells Rapunzel that Flynn is only interested in one thing before revealing the satchel with the tiara. She tells Rapunzel to prove her wrong and test Eugene by giving him the satchel but not to come crying if he takes it and leaves. Unsure but fearful that Mother Gothel may be right, Rapunzel hides the satchel as Flynn returns. They settle down for the night while Gothel and the Stabbington brothers keep an eye on them nearby.The next morning, Eugene wakes to see a soaking wet Maximus glaring angrily down at him. Maximus attempts to carry Eugene off but Rapunzel befriends the horse and convinces him to let Eugene stay with her until after she sees the floating lights. Maximus relents but accompanies the pair as they travel into the kingdom. The marketplace is alive with vendors and townsfolk preparing for the sky lantern festival and Rapunzel's hair is tightly braided to prevent it from dragging. While she and Eugene tour the kingdom, she notices a large tile portrait of the Royal family, including a baby with golden hair. Eugene finds himself growing fond of Rapunzel and, as the time for the lanterns to be released approaches, takes her out on a boat to the middle of the lake surrounding the castle. There, they watch in awe as the lights are released and the sky is filled with a soft orange glow. One lantern with a sun emblem on it floats down and Rapunzel gently pushes it back skyward. She then reveals the satchel she had been hiding to Eugene but, unlike what Mother Gothel predicted, he puts it aside and takes Rapunzel's hands in his.Before they can kiss, Eugene spies the Stabbington brothers on the nearby shore. He rows the boat in, tells Rapunzel to wait, and goes to meet them with the satchel. Realizing that he cares more about Rapunzel than the tiara, he gives the satchel to the brothers but they reveal they're no longer interested in the tiara. While she waits by the boat, Rapunzel is shocked to see the Stabbington brothers approach. They tell her that Eugene betrayed her trust and point to his silhouette in a boat on the lake before attempting to kidnap her for her hair's power. Horrified, Rapunzel tries to run but her long hair gets caught on a tree log. Before the brothers can grab her, Mother Gothel appears and knocks both of them unconscious. In tears and promising to never disobey her again, Rapunzel leaves with Mother Gothel back to the tower.Eugene's boat, meanwhile, docks just outside the palace. Maximus watches from nearby as Flynn comes to, having been knocked out and tied to the mast of the boat with the tiara beside him. The guards on the dock immediately arrest him.Back within the confines of the tower, Mother Gothel comforts Rapunzel and tells her that they shall put this whole experience behind them. As she walks up to her room, Rapunzel notices a recurring theme: all around her, painted on the walls and embroidered on her bed sheets, is the same sun emblem that she saw within the kingdom and on the very lantern she pushed skyward. She remembers the baby with golden blonde hair held by her brown-haired parents and suddenly realizes that she is the missing princess! She confronts Gothel about this who admits the truth but maintains that everything she did was for Rapunzel's protection. When Rapunzel asks what's to become of Eugene, Gothel tells her that he is to be executed. Enraged, Rapunzel goes to leave but Gothel resolves to 'be the bad guy' and approaches her menacingly.As he is led to the gallows, Eugene sees the Stabbington brothers incarcerated in their own cell. He demands to know what has happened to Rapunzel and they admit that they were acting under the promises of Mother Gothel to get Rapunzel back. Eugene struggles to escape, knowing that Rapunzel is in danger, but is unable to. Maximus then arrives with a few of the thugs from the Snuggly Duckling (Jeffrey Tambor,Brad Garrett,Paul F. Tompkins, andRichard Kiel) and they help Eugene break out so that he can ride out to Rapunzel's tower.Beneath the tower, he calls out to Rapunzel and her hair is let down for him to climb. When he reaches the top, however, he finds Rapunzel bound and gagged in a chair. Before she can warn him, Gothel emerges from the shadows and stabs Eugene in the side with her dagger. He reels back, falling against a vanity mirror and breaking the glass. Gothel then tells Rapunzel that she will take her far away where no one will ever find her. Struggling against her gag, Rapunzel promises that she will go with Gothel willingly if she is allowed to heal Eugene. Gothel agrees and Rapunzel goes to the dying Eugene. Before she can begin singing he pulls her close and cuts her hair with shard of glass. With the enchantment broken, Rapunzel's hair turns into its normal brown and Gothel staggers back as her skin begins to wrinkle. Horrified by her reflection, she trips over some of Rapunzel's cut hair and falls out the window. By the time her cloak hits the ground, she's rapidly aged into a pile of ashes.With his dying breath, Eugene tells Rapunzel that she was his new dream and she tells him the same. Crying over him, Rapunzel recites her song one last time. A lone tear falls from her eyes into Eugene's and the last bit of magic that remained in her revives him. The two lovers embrace and kiss before traveling together back to the castle where Rapunzel is reunited with her real parents. Eugene, now addressed by his true name, is welcomed into the Royal family. He and Rapunzel are soon married and live happily ever after."
The Karate Kid,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155076/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Work causes a single mother to move to China with her young son; in his new home, the boy embraces kung fu, taught to him by a master. 12-year-old Dre Parker has moved to China, and finds himself like a fish out of water. He befriends a fellow classmate, Mei Ying, only to make a rival, Cheng, who starts to bully and attack Dre. Soon, Mr Han, the maintenance man of Dre's apartment, fends off Cheng and his friends when they are attacking Dre and signs Dre up to fight in the Kung Fu tournament in return for the bullies laying off of Dre. Dre realizes Mr. Han is much more than a maintenance man, when he's revealed as a master of Kung Fu and Dre soon learns that Kung Fu is about self defense and peace, instead of violence and bloodshed.—Kennedy In search of a fresh start, the widowed mother, Sherry Parker, and her 12-year-old son, Dre, move from Detroit to Beijing in China, after a job transfer. Before the obvious language barrier and the daunting task of acclimatising to a foreign culture and a new school, Dre is indeed a friendless stranger in a strange land, and to make matters worse, he will soon catch Cheng's eye, the school's fearsome bully. As Dre tries to impress the young violinist, Meiying, he will learn the hard way that his pitiful karate is no match against Cheng's excellent but vicious kung fu; something that the building's janitor and inconspicuous kung fu master, Mr Han, is eager to remedy. Suddenly, an upcoming tournament will give a new meaning in Dre's life, however, will he finally make a stand against his powerful opponent?—Nick Riganas When his mother's career results in a move to China, 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) finds that he is a stranger in a strange land. Though he knows a little karate, his fighting skills are no match for Cheng, the school bully. Dre finds a friend in Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), a maintenance man who is also a martial-arts master. Mr. Han teaches Dre all about kung fu in the hope that Dre will be able to face down Cheng and perhaps win the heart of a pretty classmate named Mei Ying. 12-year-old Dre Parker could've been the most popular kid in Detroit, but his mother's latest career move has landed him in China. Dre immediately falls for his classmate Mei Ying - and the feeling is mutual - but cultural differences make such a friendship impossible. Even worse, Dre's feelings make an enemy of the class bully, Cheng. In the land of kung fu, Dre knows only a little karate, and Cheng puts ""the karate kid"" on the floor with ease. With no friends in a strange land, Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han, who is secretly a master of kung fu. As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life.—Columbia Pictures 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) and his mother, Sherry (Taraji P. Henson), arrive in Beijing from West Detroit to start a new life. Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Mei Ying (Wen Wen Han), who reciprocates his attention, but Cheng (Zhenwei Wang), a kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Mei Ying's, attempts to keep them apart by beating Dre, and later harassing and humiliating him in and around school. During a particularly brutal beating by Cheng and his friends, the enigmatic maintenance man of Dre's building, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as a kung fu master who adeptly dispatches Dre's tormentors.After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, they go to Cheng's teacher, Master Li (Yu Rongguang), to attempt to make peace, but the brutal Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. When Han declines, Li threatens him, saying that they will not be allowed to leave his school unless either Dre or Han himself fights. Han acquiesces, but insists the fight take place at an upcoming tournament, and that Li's students leave Dre alone until the tournament. The amused Li agrees.Han begins training Dre, but Dre is frustrated that Han merely has Dre spend hours taking off his jacket, hanging it up, dropping it, and then putting it back on again. After days of this, Dre refuses to continue, until Han demonstrates to him that the repetitive arm movements in question were Han's method of teaching Dre defensive block and strike techniques, which Dre is now able to display instinctively when prompted by Han's mock attacks. Han emphasizes that the movements Dre is learning apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial arts. During one lesson in the Wudang Mountains, Dre notices a female kung fu practitioner (Michelle Yeoh, in an uncredited cameo[4]) apparently copying the movements of a cobra before her, but Han informs him that it was the cobra that was imitating the woman, as in a mirror reflection. Dre wants Han to teach him this technique, which includes linking Han's hand and feet to Dre's via bamboo shafts while practicing their forms, but Dre's subsequent attempt to use this reflection technique on his mother is unsuccessful.As Dre's friendship with Mei Ying continues, she agrees to attend Dre's tournament, as does Dre her upcoming recital. Dre persuades Mei Ying to cut school for a day of fun, but when she is nearly late for her violin recital, which has been rescheduled for that day, she tells him that her parents have deemed him a bad influence, and forbid her from spending any more time with him. Later, when Dre finds Mr. Han despondent, he learns that it is the anniversary of his wife and son's deaths, which occurred years ago when he lost control of his car while arguing with his wife. Dre reminds Han that one of his lessons was in perseverance, and that Han needs to heal from his loss, and tries to help him do so. Han then assists Dre in reading a note, in Chinese, of apology to Mei Ying's father, who, impressed, allows Mei to attend the tournament.At the tournament, the under-confident Dre is slow to achieve parity with his opponents, but soon begins to beat them, and advances to the semifinals, as does Cheng, who violently finishes off his opponents. Dre eventually comes up against Liang, another of Master Li's students, who is instructed by Master Li to break Dre's leg. When Liang insists that he can beat Dre, Master Li sternly tells him that he doesn't want him beaten, but broken. During the match, Liang delivers a devastating kick to Dre's leg, along with a series of brutal follow-up punches. Although Liang is disqualified for his illegal strikes, Dre is incapacitated, which would allow Cheng to win by default.Despite Han's insistence that he has earned respect for his performance in the tournament, Dre convinces Han to use his fire cupping technique to mend his leg, in order to see the tournament to the end. Dre returns to the arena, where he confronts Cheng. Dre delivers impressive blows, but Cheng counters with a debilitating strike to Dre's already injured leg. Dre struggles to get up, and adopts the one-legged form he first learned from the woman on the mountain, attempting to use the reflection technique to manipulate Cheng's movements. Cheng charges Dre, but Dre flips, and catches Cheng with a kick to his head, winning the tournament, along with the respect of Cheng and his classmates, both for himself and Mr. Han."
TRON: Legacy,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The son of a virtual world designer goes looking for his father and ends up inside the digital world that his father designed.

With the help of the fearless warrior Quorra (Wilde), father and son embark on a life-or-death journey across a cyber universe -- a universe created by Kevin himself that has become far more advanced with vehicles, weapons, landscapes and a ruthless villain who will stop at nothing to prevent their escape.—Walt Disney Pictures In 1989, computer genius Kevin Flynn tells his young son about his adventures in the cyber world of Tron. He talks about the friends he made and his emissary CLU which is a program he made in his likeness. He promises that one day he will take him to the Grid, but Flynn disappears and Sam is devastated. 20 years later, his father's company ENCOM is being operated by the Board who take the company in a different direction as oppose to Flynn's. Sam spends his time moping over his father's disappearance and pulling a prank on the board. One day, Alan Bradley, his father's best friend tells Sam that he got a page from the phone at his father's office at his arcade.

After being mistaken for a program, he finds himself subjected to all sorts of contests but when they discover he is not a program but a user. He is brought to the head man whom Sam thinks is his father but later discovers that it's CLU and he makes Sam take part in a light cycle battle. Sam is saved by a program named Quorra who takes him to his father. That's where he tells Sam that CLU turned on him and was planning to enter their world to ""fix"" it's imperfections, so to stop him he closed the portal trapping himself there which is why he never came back. Sam wants to go back but Flynn doesn't want to give CLU the chance to carry out his plan, so he chooses not to but Sam defies him.—rcs0411@yahoo.com The Master Control Program is booted back up in this revamped Tron continuation that sees the return of original star Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, the brilliant computer programmer whose disappearance leads his son, Sam (Garrett Hedlund), to search for him in and out of the computer world. 1989: Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), now CEO of ENCOM, tells his seven year-old son, Sam (Owen Best), about his adventures in the Grid, a completely digital world within the Tron computer system that Flynn created. Flynn explains to Sam that, with his counterpart Clu (Jeff Bridges, body performance;John Reardon) - the second of a Codified Likeness Utility modeled after Flynn - and the security program Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), he discovered something amazing within the Grid; a miracle. Sam asks what it is but Flynn holds the story for next time before putting Sam to bed and going to work. A series of newspaper articles and television reports follow announcing the mysterious disappearance of Kevin Flynn after that night. Since the passing of Sam's mother (Amy Esterle) several years prior, Flynn's absence leaves him effectively orphaned and puts ENCOM's future in a state of jeopardy. Sam is left to stay with his paternal grandparents (Donnelly RhodesandBelinda Montgomery), questioning the nature of his father's disappearance.20 years later, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) rides his motorcycle through the night streets towards ENCOM tower. He hacks into the building and evades security cameras as he makes his way upstairs. Meanwhile, a board meeting is being held where Richard Mackey (Jeffrey Nordling) presents the new OS-12, a secure operating system. When Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) inquires about improvements to the system, given the high prices already charged, young Edward Dillinger II (Cillian Murphy: uncredited) says that the idea of sharing software for free disappeared with Kevin Flynn. Sam breaks into the control room and swaps out the OS-12 master file so that when Mackey attempts to run it, all he sees is a repetitive video of Sam's dog Marv (a Boston terrier). Sam smirks as he passes the boardroom, followed closely by a security guard (Dan Joffre). When Mackey angrily asks where the master file is, Bradley announces that it's on the web.The security guard, Ernie, chases Sam onto the rooftops where Sam reveals his true identity as the largest shareholder of the company before he leaps off the edge of the building. He parachutes safely to the ground but gets snagged on a traffic light and is soon arrested by police. Sam makes bail and returns home; a shipping container refitted as an apartment and overlooking the city skyline across the river, including ENCOM tower. Bradley visits Sam, commending him on his latest prank, apparently an annual event that Sam performs on the day of his father's disappearance. Bradley tells Sam that he recently received a page from Flynn's office above his arcade, a number that hasn't been in use for 20 years. Sam reluctantly follows the tip and heads to the arcade. There he finds a secret doorway behind his father's Tron arcade game which leads him down a passage and into a confined control room. Sam sits at the computer to find that it still works and searches through it for information. However, he unknowingly activates a large laser behind him which emits a digitizing ray, sending him straight into the Grid. Shocked at the sudden change in environment, Sam stumbles outside the arcade where he is quickly picked up by a Recognizer. The programs on board restrain him and the Recognizer takes off again.Sam comes face to face with other captive programs, including one that nervously chatters (Christopher Logan) and one missing half his face (Yurij Kis). They are all taken to the edge of the Gaming Grid where they are assigned either for derezzing or games. Sam watches as the nervous program is assigned to the games but, once free, plunges himself into an in-ground fan, derezzing himself. Sent to the armory, Sam's clothes are removed by Sirens (Serinda Swan,Yaya DaCosta, andLizzy Mathis) and is fitted with armor and an Identity Disc. The last Siren, Gem (Beau Garrett), instructs Sam to survive before he is led out onto the gaming grid for Disc Wars. He is pitted against an opponent (Allen Jo: uncredited) whom he manages to defeat before trying to escape the arena. Sam comes out on the final round to face Rinzler (Anis Cheurfa) who quickly subdues him. When he sees blood on Sam's armor, Rinzler recognizes him as a user and faces him towards a viewing box above the arena where the watching authority figure asks Sam to identify himself. The figure then summons Sam to see him where he reveals himself as a youthful Kevin Flynn. Amazed to see his father, Sam asks if they can go home, but his request is denied. His 'father' then reveals himself as Clu and, after seeing nothing of note on Sam's Disc, sends him to the Lightcycle arena.Clu's right-hand man, Jarvis (James Frain), entices the crowd before Sam is put on a team of programs while Clu battles them with his own team. One by one, the racing programs are eliminated while a mysterious figure watches overhead. Before Sam and Clu can face off, the figure intervenes with a Light Runner and blasts a hole out of the arena, escaping off-Grid into the Outlands where other programs' vehicles cannot follow. The figure introduces herself as Quorra (Olivia Wilde) and takes Sam out to a secluded home situated on a craggy hilltop. Inside, Sam is tearfully reunited with his real father who had been meditating upon Sam's arrival. Quorra shows Sam that Flynn has been teaching her about the real world before they all sit down to dinner. Sam and his father catch up before Flynn answers Sam's biggest question: why he never came home.Flynn reveals that, as Sam now knows, when he went to work he was really entering the Grid, working with Tron and Clu on creating the 'perfect system'. The 'miracle' that Flynn spoke of before disappearing was the birth of the ISO's; isomorphic algorithms that spontaneously evolved from the Grid without user intervention and with properties that Flynn had never seen before. Their makeup included bio-digital genetics that Flynn was convinced would change the world. However, Clu saw them as imperfections. Tasked by Flynn to create the perfect system, Clu performed a coup, ambushing Flynn and Tron and taking over the system. Tron was presumably derezzed and Flynn was forced to flee into the Outlands while the ISO's were destroyed, an event known as the Purge. The portal - the only way out of the Grid - saw the end of its millicycle window (8 hours in the Grid; just 30 seconds in the real world - which means Flynn's absence of 20 years equated to nearly 20,000 years) and closed on Flynn, leaving him trapped. With Sam's arrival, the portal is open again and Sam argues that they have time to escape, but Flynn refuses. He explains that it's a move that Clu anticipates in hopes of retrieving Flynn's identity disc to use to manipulate the portal. Flynn is also certain that it was Clu who sent the page to Alan.Understanding Sam's frustration, Quorra goes to him in his room and tells him about a program in the city named Zuse who used to help the ISO's during the Purge and may be of some help. Sam takes Flynn's vintage Lightcycle into the city where he trades it for a cloak. However, he's recognized by the Siren Gem who takes him to Zuse's End of Line Club where a large party is being entertained. There, he meets the eccentric Castor (Michael Sheen) who promises to take Sam to Zuse.After finding Sam gone, Flynn resolves to head into the city though Quorra assures him that she sent Sam to someone they could trust. Regardless, they head out as Clu's guards locate Flynn's Lightcycle and trace it to the point of origin. Clu prepares a group and flies out to Flynn's home to find it empty. As he looks around, Clu recalls when he was first created and how Flynn promised that they would change the world together. The thought makes him furious.Sam, meanwhile, is taken by Castor to a private room above the party while the masked DJ's (Daft Punk) spin a tune. Castor reveals to Sam that he *is* Zuse but admits that his services have turned with the tide. At that moment, the club is infiltrated by Clu's guards and Sam steps out to fight them. Quorra arrives and fights along Sam but is overpowered and her left arm is derezzed. Flynn then appears and derezzes the rest of the guards before escorting Sam, carrying Quorra who has gone into a state of shock, to the elevator to escape. Zuse propels an extension cord to capture Flynn's Disc as the elevator doors shut and sabotages the lowering mechanism. Flynn manages to slow the elevator before they crash and scolds Sam for 'messing with his Zen thing, man'. They decide to then board a Solar Sailer which should take them directly to the portal.Clu arrives at the club where Zuse presumes a silent agreement: Flynn's Disc for control of the city. But, as he and Gem watch, Clu orders his guards to rig the place with bombs and, as Clu leaves in his ship, the tower explodes.As they ride the Solar Sailer, Flynn takes Quorra's Identity Disc and rearranges the corrupted material that will enable her arm to regenerate. He also shows Sam that Quorra is an ISO; the very last one. Her digital readout shows that she has triple-stranded DNA. ""Bio-digital jazz, man."" Flynn then leaves Quorra with Sam to reboot so that he can 'knock on the sky and listen to the sound'. Quorra wakes up moments later and tells Sam that Flynn saved her during the Purge. They bond further and Quorra asks more about the real world. Sam tries to describe to her what the sun looks like as Flynn looks on, smiling. Suddenly, the Solar Sailer intersects the Rectifier, a large carrier ship. Flynn, Quorra, and Sam hide among the cargo units of the Sailer and discover that programs are encased within, en route to be reprogrammed into an army for Clu. Rinzler then appears and begins to investigate the Sailer. Flynn suddenly recognizes Rinzler as his old friend, Tron; reconfigured as Clu's henchman. Quorra gives Sam her disc and runs into Rinzler's line of sight where she is immediately captured and taken away.Flynn and Sam use Quorra's distraction to move out. They find Clu giving an announcement to his army. With Flynn's disc in his possession, he intends to use it to allow passage into the real world where they may 'perfect' it. Flynn and Sam agree to a plan and split up. Clu goes to his tower where Flynn's disc is stored. There, Quorra is brought to him and, when he sees that she is an ISO, claims that he has something special in mind for her. Flynn makes his way to the Light Jet hangar where he reprograms a guard, allowing him to access one of the vehicles. Meanwhile, Sam makes his way to Clu's docking tower to rescue Quorra and retrieve Flynn's Disc. He fights off the guards there and intimidates Jarvis, allowing him to retrieve Flynn's Disc. Rinzler confronts him, holding Quorra as a hostage, but Sam fights him off and defeats him by knocking him off the edge of the tower. Sam takes Quorra and leaps off the tower, using a wing-like parachute to glide to the ground. They meet up with Flynn in his Light Jet and Quorra takes the pilot's seat.Clu storms into the tower to find Rinzler, having climbed back from the ledge, and Jarvis looking sullen. As he watches Flynn's Light Jet leave the carrier, he strikes down Jarvis with his Disc and leaps out of the tower, creating his own Light Jet. Rinzler and a few guards follow. As they fly over the Sea of Simulation, Sam is sent to the Light Jet's turret to fire on their pursuers. Rinzler flies over the Light Jet and he and Flynn make eye contact for the first time. Flynn speaks out to him and the connection allows Rinzler to regain his memories of being Tron. He turns against Clu, crying out ""I fight for the users!"" However, Clu wins out on the battle, sending Tron sinking into the Sea of Simulation, his armor circuitry changing from red to blue.Flynn asks Quorra to do something for him just before they arrive at the portal. As they walk up the pathway, they find Clu standing before them. Clu confronts Flynn and insists that all he was trying to do was what Flynn instructed him to. Flynn apologizes to Clu and says that perfection is impossible because it's unknowable; but Clu would not know that because Flynn didn't when he created him. This revelation incites Clu to attack Flynn who yells at Sam and Quorra to continue to the portal. Though determined not to lose his father again, Sam is pushed forward by Quorra. Clu takes Flynn's Disc and reads it to see that it's actually Quorra's; Flynn had swapped his with her before arrival. Infuriated, Clu jumps the gap between the gate and the portal but Flynn performs reintegration; a destructive method of rejoining Clu to him. Flynn watches tearfully and with pride as Sam holds his Disc into the portal. He says, ""Goodbye, kiddo"" before Clu is merged with him. Sam and Quorra escape the Grid just before the union which results in a massive explosion that destroys it.Back in his father's office, Sam saves the Tron system onto a microchip that he laces around his neck. He pages Alan to the shop and tells him that he was right about everything. Sam says that he will take back ENCOM and would like Alan as chairman. Leaving the arcade, Sam greets Quorra who asks what they will do now. Sam tells her that he has something to show her and takes her for a ride on his motorcycle. As they ride out into the real world, Quorra sees the sun rise for the first time."
True Grit,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403865/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A stubborn teenager enlists the help of a tough U.S. Marshal to track down her father's murderer. Following the murder of her father by hired hand Tom Chaney, 14-year-old farm girl Mattie Ross sets out to capture the killer. To aid her, she hires the toughest U.S. marshal she can find, a man with ""true grit,"" Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn. Mattie insists on accompanying Cogburn, whose drinking, sloth, and generally reprobate character do not augment her faith in him. Against his wishes, she joins him in his trek into the Indian Nations in search of Chaney. They are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, who wants Chaney for his own purposes. The unlikely trio find danger and surprises on the journey, and each has his or her ""grit"" tested.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross joins an aging U.S. marshal and another lawman in tracking her father's killer into hostile Indian territory in Joel and Ethan Coen's adaptation of Charles Portis' original novel. Sticking more closely to the source material than the 1969 feature adaptation starring Western icon John Wayne, the Coens' True Grit tells the story from the young girl's perspective, and re-teams the celebrated filmmaking duo with their No Country for Old Men producing partner Scott Rudin. Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper co-star. 1870 Fort Smith, Arkansas. With nothing but revenge to keep her going after the murder of her father by a once-trusted, cowardly snake, plucky fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross entices the mean, one-eyed U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn with a reward to hunt down her father's killer. As the excellent sharpshooter, Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, joins in, the unlikely trio forms a reluctant team and embarks on a peril-laden quest deep into the heart of the hostile Indian Territory to track down the murderer. However, the rugged wilderness is no place for a girl, and the odds are against them. Now, only vengeance matters. Is true grit enough to see justice served?—Nick Riganas In 1878, Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), a fourteen-year-old from Yell County, Arkansas, is determined to avenge her murdered father. Frank Ross was killed by his hired hand, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), after trying to dissuade a drunken Chaney from shooting a fellow card player who had allegedly cheated him. Chaney stole Ross's horse and fled the town. Enraged that no one bothered to pursue or convict Chaney, Mattie takes the investigation into her own hands.Leaving her mother and two younger siblings at home, Mattie travels to Fort Smith where her father was killed. Despite her tender age, Mattie is clever, confident, and an unshakable bargainer. She sells her father's now useless string of ponies back to the reluctant seller, Col. Stonehill (Dakin Matthews), and acquires three hundred and twenty dollars from the sale. Renting a room at a Fort Smith boarding house, where her father had been staying before his death, Mattie resolves to hire a U.S. marshal to track down Tom Chaney. After consulting the local sheriff during a public hanging, she settles on the marshal described as the meanest and most fearless: Rueben ""Rooster"" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). After trailing Cogburn to a saloon, she attempts to hire him but is rebuffed. Mattie makes a second attempt after a court hearing at which Cogburn gave testimony, but Cogburn turns her down again, doubting that she actually possesses the fifty dollars she offered him as a reward for Chaney's capture.At the boarding house, Mattie is approached by a Texas Ranger, LaBouef (Matt Damon), who is aware of her mission to bring Tom Chaney to justice. LaBouef had been tracking Chaney for several months after Chaney had murdered a Texas senator. He offers to combine his knowledge with Cogburn's to track Chaney down. Mattie, put off by LaBouef's cocky attitude, rejects his offer.The following day, Mattie buys back one of her father's ponies to use on her journey, naming him Little Blackie. She visits with Cogburn, who has decided to accept her offer, though he refuses to let Mattie accompany him as she had planned. After Mattie threatens to report Cogburn to the sheriff if he leaves with her fifty dollars, he seemingly gives in and instructs her to be ready for the journey the next morning.Armed with her father's pistol, Mattie rides her pony to Cogburn's lodgings in the morning, but discovers that he had joined forces with LaBouef, departed without her, and left her a train ticket back to Yell County. Furious and insulted, Mattie follows his trail to a nearby river, spying Cogburn and LaBouef on the opposite bank. After the ferryman refuses to take her across, Mattie rides Little Blackie into the water and the two swim to the other side. Cogburn seems impressed by Mattie's gumption, but LaBouef is clearly irritated by her domineering attitude. After an ensuing argument with Cogburn, whom he also dislikes, LaBouef abandons the mission, taunting Cogburn for being ""hoo-rahed by a little girl.""Mattie and Cogburn continue the journey, forming something of a kinship as they travel. Cogburn picks up the information that Tom Chaney is not too far ahead of them, and that he may have joined up with another outlaw, Lucky Ned Pepper, and his gang. Seeking shelter from the cold, the two discover a cabin at nightfall, but find that it is temporarily inhabited by two men whom Cogburn recognizes as Emmett Quincy (Paul Rae) and Moon (Domhnall Gleeson), outlaws tied in with the Ned Pepper gang. Moon has a bullet wound in his leg, and is clearly in great pain. Noticing the substantial amount of food being prepared, Cogburn suspects the rest of the Pepper gang will arrive at the cabin soon. He offers to take Moon to a doctor and to give them some escape time if they provide information. Moon, desperate for medical attention, begins to talk, but is mortally stabbed by Quincy, who is then shot dead by Cogburn. As he dies, Moon admits that Lucky Ned is expected at the cabin that very night.Cogburn and Mattie hide in the bushes near the cabin, waiting for the gang to arrive. They first see LaBouef approach the cabin, continuing the search alone. However, the Ned Pepper gang arrives moments later. One of them lassos LaBouef, dragging him off his horse. From cover, Cogburn shoots two of the gang members (inadvertently winging LeBouef in the arm), causing the others to flee. He and Mattie take the injured LaBouef into the cabin, though LaBouef is unhappy to be working with Cogburn again. Cogburn drinks heavily throughout the night and is incredibly intoxicated as they set out the next morning. He and LaBouef squabble over their marksmanship skills, but Mattie attempts to keep the two men on task.After setting up camp in the woods that night, Cogburn vents his frustration about their mission, claiming he has been ""dragged into a wild goose chase by a harpy in trousers and a nincompoop."" He bows out of the arrangement, and LaBouef departs again, though he has gained genuine respect for Mattie. Both men agree that Chaney's trail is cold, and that continuing the search would be useless. A dejected Mattie falls asleep.The next morning, Mattie goes to a nearby stream for water and notices a stranger there watering his horses. Shocked, she realizes it is none other than Tom Chaney himself. Chaney recognizes her as Frank Ross's daughter and seems merely bemused by her presence until Mattie brandishes her father's revolver and attempts to take him into custody. An angered Chaney approaches with his rifle and Mattie fires, but only grazes his arm. Chaney drags her to the opposite bank, where the rest of the Ned Pepper gang has set up camp. Cogburn, having slept in the woods through the night, hears the commotion but is too late to retrieve Mattie.Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper), familiar with Cogburn, shouts across the stream to him and bargains Mattie's life for ample escape time. Cogburn agrees to not pursue the gang if Mattie is not harmed, and appears to ride away over the hills. Pepper is impressed by Mattie's strength of will, and assures her that she will not be hurt. While Ned and the three other gang members leave to address finances, Chaney is ordered to stay with Mattie and to leave her somewhere safe. Chaney tries to get out of the assignment, but to no avail. Mattie, despite Lucky Ned's assurance otherwise, fears that Chaney will kill her once they are alone. After the gang departs, Mattie offers to give Chaney an affidavit if he sets her free. Chaney refuses, saying that all he needs is Mattie's silence. He attacks her and holds a knife to her throat, but is knocked unconscious by LaBouef, who had remained in the area and heard the earlier gunshots. He explains that he rode back to the woods, met with Cogburn, and outlined a plan for Mattie's rescue. He says that Cogburn himself has arranged a showdown with Lucky Ned.As Mattie and LaBouef watch from a hilltop, Cogburn comes face to face with Ned and the three other gang members. Having pursued Ned on and off for some time, Cogburn gives Ned the choice of being taken back to Fort Smith to be hanged, or to be killed on the spot. Ned taunts Cogburn, calling him a ""one-eyed fat man,"" and Cogburn charges his horse. Holding the reins in his teeth, he fires revolvers with both hands, killing the three other men and mortally wounding Lucky Ned before his horse takes a fall, trapping Cogburn underneath. Ned, with his last moments of strength, prepares to kill Cogburn. From the hilltop, LaBouef proves his skill in marksmanship by making a 400-yard rifle shot, shooting Lucky Ned off his horse before the marshal is harmed. Moments later, LaBouef is knocked unconscious by a now-awakened Tom Chaney, who attempts to grab LaBouef's rifle. Mattie intercepts and seizes the gun herself. Ordering Chaney to stand, Mattie fires a fatal shot to his chest, fulfilling her goal of avenging her father.The recoil from the blast sends Mattie stumbling backwards into a deep pit. She calls for help, but LaBouef is still out cold. Cogburn appears and begins to scale the side of the pit with a rope to rescue her, but Mattie's left hand has already been bitten by a rattlesnake. Cogburn retrieves her and temporarily treats her wound, but knows he must get her medical attention quickly or she will die. A revived LaBouef hoists them out of the pit, and Cogburn and Mattie ride away on Little Blackie.After miles of running, Little Blackie begins to suffer from exhaustion and eventually collapses. Knowing they cannot stop their journey, Cogburn shoots the horse and continues on, carrying Mattie himself. They soon reach a general store and Mattie is taken inside.Nearly twenty-five years later, forty-year-old Mattie (Elizabeth Marvel) looks back on her adventures. Her arm had been severely damaged by the snake venom and was amputated. Cogburn had departed by the time she came back into consciousness. After returning home to her family in Arkansas, Mattie had written to Cogburn, inviting him to visit her and collect his fifty dollar reward, but he never responded or appeared. The adult Mattie learns that the elderly Cogburn is now a performer in a traveling wild west show, and finally exchanges letters with him, arranging to meet once again to swap stories. Arriving at the fairgrounds, Mattie is told that Cogburn had died three days earlier.Mattie has Cogburn's body moved to her family plot. She reflects on her life; she never married, and kept her no-nonsense attitude over the years. She never heard again from LaBouef, but holds him in her memory. Mattie laments that ""time just gets away from us."""
Clash of the Titans,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800320/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Perseus, a demigod and the son of Zeus, battles the minions of Hades and the Underworld in order to stop them from conquering Olympus and Earth. Born of god but raised by humans, Perseus, the demigod son of mighty Zeus, the king of the gods, vows to take his revenge on Hades, the terrifying ruler of the Underworld, when he sees his mortal family perish. As the race of men summons up the courage to rebel against the gods of Olympus, the doomed city of Argos becomes a battlefield, as Hades threatens to unleash the legendary sea-monster, Kraken, unless the fair Princess Andromeda willingly offers herself as a sacrifice. Now, having nothing more to lose, Perseus embarks on a daring, peril-laden quest to stop the forces of evil before Hades plunges the world into chaos and darkness. But, to survive the relentless onslaught of demons and terrible adversaries, Perseus must first embrace his destiny. Will Perseus defy the gods, and save humankind in the clash of the Titans?—Nick Riganas Princess Andromeda is the daughter of King Cepheus, who has gained a victory against the gods. The vengeful god of the underworld, Hades, demands that Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice or he will unleash the Kraken against Argos. A desperate King Cepheus asks demi-god Perseus to find a way to defeat the Kraken. Perseus accepts the challenge because Hades was responsible for his family's death. He discovers that the way to kill the Kraken lies with getting the head of the gorgon Medusa.—Kad Clash of the Titans (2010)is set in the Greek city of Argos, where a war is about to explode between man and the gods. A narration introduces the three Olympians who battled the Titans long ago: the brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and Hades (Ralph Fiennes). Hades provided the means of defeating the Titans with his creation, the Kraken. After the Titans' defeat, Zeus created humans and ruled them while Poseidon ruled the sea, but Hades, having been deceived by Zeus, was forced to rule the Underworld. Zeus and Poseidon gain power from the prayers of humans, but Hades learns another way: fear.A fisherman named Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite) finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering a baby, Perseus, and his dead mother, Danaë (Tine Stapelfeldt), inside. Spyros decides to raise Perseus as his own. Years later, Perseus (Sam Worthington) and his family are fishing when they witness a group of soldiers from Argos destroying a statue of Zeus as a declaration of war against the gods. Hades appears and commands harpies to massacre the soldiers before he himself destroys Perseus's family's fishing boat. Perseus tries to save his family, but to no avail.The surviving soldiers take Perseus back to Argos. During a feast for the returning soldiers King Kepheus (Vincent Regan) and Queen Cassiopeia (Polly WalkerandKatherine Loeppky) of Argos compare themselves and their daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), to the gods, much to their daughter's dismay. After convincing his brother to let him loose on humanity to punish Argos for its hubris, Hades appears in the courtroom before killing the remaining soldiers while Perseus is unaffected. Revealing Perseus to be the demigod son of Zeus, and aging Cassiopeia to death, Hades threatens that if Princess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Kraken, Argos will be destroyed in 10 days. Hermes (Alexander Siddig), the messenger god, approaches Zeus on Olympus, revealing the location of his son Perseus. Hermes suggests offering Perseus sanctuary, but Zeus declares that he shall be left to his fate, along with the other infidel mortals.The king seeks the help of Perseus after he is placed in the dungeon. Perseus refuses until he meets Io (Gemma Arterton), a woman who does not age as punishment for refusing to be seduced by a god. Io reveals that Perseus' conception was a punishment conducted by Zeus on Acrisius (Jason Flemyng), the former king of Argos who was married to Danaë, for his actions against the gods. When Acrisius set Danaë and the baby Perseus adrift in their coffin, an enraged Zeus struck Acrisius with lightning, leaving him hideously disfigured. After learning that killing the Kraken would allow him to have his revenge against Hades, Perseus agrees to help. He and Argos' finest soldiers embark on a quest to find the Stygian Witches with a pair of Persian monster-hunters named Ixas (Hans Matheson) and Kucuk (Mouloud Achour), and Io following. To counter this turn of events, Hades enlists Acrisius, now called Calibos, to kill off Perseus. Hades imbues Calibos with superhuman powers.In the woods, Perseus and his men discover a sword forged in Olympus that will only display power if it is wielded by Perseus. While separated from the group, Perseus encounters Zeus' sacred herd of flying horses, the Pegasus. However, Perseus refuses both the sword and the pure-black Pegasus that the gods offer as assistance, as he does not wish to be a god. Calibos attacks the group and tries to murder Perseus, killing several soldiers in the process, but Calibos is unsuccessful, losing his hand before escaping. However, Calibos's blood forms giant scorpions from the sand that attack Perseus and his group. Though they kill several scorpions, most of the group are slain, and the survivors are surrounded by more of the monsters. They are saved by the Djinn, a band of once-human desert sorcerers who have replaced their earthly flesh with ash and dark magic. The mysterious beings are able to hypnotize the scorpions into submission. Though not trusted prior to healing Perseus's wound, the Djinn leader, Sheikh Suleiman (Ian Whyte), joins Perseus's group. The Djinn want to see the gods' wish for destruction fail.The heroes arrive at Garden of Stygia, learning from the Stygian Witches that the head of the Gorgon Medusa (Natalia Vodianova) could kill the Kraken, but that Perseus and his group will die in the process. After leaving the witches, with the hunters taking their leave, Perseus is visited by Zeus who offers him asylum on Mount Olympus, but he refuses. Zeus gives him instead a golden drachma, which Perseus later learns is a means to bribe Charon for passage into the Underworld. While Io remains outside Medusa's lair, due to a spell that forbids any woman from entering the area, Perseus' remaining soldiers fight hard to stay alive but are turned to stone one by one by her gaze. But with Suleiman self-destructing and Draco's sacrifice, Perseus manages to behead Medusa and her stumbling body falls into a fire. Perseus emerges in time to see Calibos kill Io by stabbing her from behind. Perseus engages Calibos in combat and kills him using the sword from Olympus, turning him back into Acrisius in human form. With his final breath as Hades's power leaves him, Acrisius tells Perseus to never become a god. Perseus stays with the dying Io until she passes on, then rides Pegasus back to Argos with Medusa's head to find some of Argos' citizens have formed a cult of Hades and are planning to sacrifice Andromeda to the Kraken against the king's wishes. By then, Hades reveals to Zeus the destruction of Argos will give him enough power to overthrow the other Olympians before leaving his powerless brother to ensure his victory.Perseus returns to Argos, but Hades sends his harpies to stop him. Perseus defeats the creatures sent by Hades and uses the head of Medusa to turn the Kraken into stone as Kepheus is killed by the cult leader, who is then crushed under the shattering Kraken. Hades appears and sneers that Perseus cannot kill him, since he is a god. Perseus retorts that while Hades can live forever, it will not be in the world of men and uses the sword to banish Hades back to the Underworld. Because Perseus has saved Argos from destruction, Andromeda suggests that Perseus become king and rule Argos at her side, but he declines. Zeus appears before Perseus again and offers to make him a god, but for a second time he refuses. Zeus warns Perseus that Hades will return to rule the world in darkness when he amasses enough fear from mankind. Since Perseus is intent on staying on Earth, Zeus resurrects Io, and the two embrace while Pegasus flies above them."

Logue records Bertie's reading on a gramophone record, but convinced that he has stammered throughout, Bertie leaves in a huff, declaring his condition ""hopeless."" Logue gives him the recording as a keepsake.Later that year, after Bertie's father, King George V (Michael Gambon), makes his 1934 Christmas address, he explains to his son the importance of broadcasting for the modern monarchy in a perilous international situation. He declares that Bertie's older brother, David, Prince of Wales, will bring ruin to the family and the country when he ascends the throne, and demands that Bertie train himself to fill in, beginning by reading his father's speech into a microphone for practice. After an agonizing attempt to do so made worse by his father's coaching, Bertie plays Logue's recording and hears himself reciting Shakespeare fluently, amazing both himself and the Duchess.Bertie returns to Logue's treatment, where they work together on muscle relaxation and breath control, as Logue gently probes the psychological roots of the stammer, much to the embarrassment of the standoffish Bertie. Nevertheless, Bertie reveals some of the pressures of his childhood, among them his strict father; the repression of his natural left-handedness; a painful treatment with metal splints for his knock-knees; a nanny who favoured his elder brother, going so far as deliberately pinching Bertie at the daily presentations to their parents so that he would cry and his parents would not want to see him; unbelievably, not feeding him adequately (""It took my parents three years to notice,"" says Bertie); and the death in 1919 of his little brother, Prince John. As the treatment progresses, Lionel and Bertie become friends and confidants.On 20 January 1936, King George V dies, and David, Prince of Wales (Guy Pearce) ascends the throne as King Edward VIII. However, David wants to marry Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), an American divorcée and socialite, which would provoke a constitutional crisis--the sovereign, as head of the Church of England, may not marry a divorced person.At a party in Balmoral Castle, Bertie points out that David cannot marry Wallis. David accuses his brother of a medieval-style plot to usurp his throne, citing Bertie's speech lessons as an attempt to groom himself. Bertie is tongue-tied at the accusation, whereupon David resurrects his childhood taunt of ""B-B-B-Bertie.""At his next treatment session, Bertie has not forgotten the incident. After he briefs Logue on the extent of David's folly with Wallis Simpson, Logue insists that Bertie could be king. Outraged, Bertie accuses Logue of treason and mocks Logue's failed acting career and humble origins, causing a rift in their friendship.When King Edward VIII does in fact abdicate to marry, Bertie becomes King George VI. Feeling overwhelmed by his accession, the new king realises that he needs Logue's help, and he and the queen visit the Logues' residence to apologise. Lionel's wife is stunned to meet the royals in their modest home. When the king insists that Logue be seated in the king's box during his May 1937 coronation in Westminster Abbey, Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. Cosmo Lang (Derek Jacobi) questions Logue's qualifications. This prompts another confrontation between the king and Logue, who explains that he never claimed to be a doctor and had only begun practicing speech therapy by informal treatment of shell-shocked soldiers in the last war. When the king still isn't convinced of his own strengths, Logue sits in St. Edward's Chair dismissing the Stone of Scone as a trifle, whereupon the king remonstrates with Logue for his disrespect. The king then realises that he is as capable as those before him.In September 1939, shortly after the United Kingdom's declaration of war with Germany, George VI summons Logue to Buckingham Palace to prepare for his radio address to the country. As the king and Logue move through the palace to a tiny studio, Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall) reveals to the king that he, too, had once had a speech impediment but found a way to use it to his advantage. The king delivers his speech as if to Logue alone, who coaches him through every moment. Afterwards, the king steps onto the balcony of the palace with his family, where thousands cheer and applaud him.A final title card explains that during the many speeches King George VI gave during World War II (1939-1945), Logue was always present. Logue and the king remained friends, and ""King George VI made Lionel Logue a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1944. This high honour from a grateful King made Lionel part of the only order of chivalry that specifically rewards acts of personal service to the Monarch."""
The Last Airbender,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0938283/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Follows the adventures of Aang, a young successor to a long line of Avatars, who must master all four elements and stop the Fire Nation from enslaving the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom. The world is divided into four kingdoms, each represented by the element they harness, and peace has lasted throughout the realms of Water, Air, Earth, and Fire under the supervision of the Avatar, a link to the spirit world and the only being capable of mastering the use of all four elements. When young Avatar Aang disappears, the Fire Nation launches an attack to eradicate all members of the Air Nomads to prevent interference in their future plans for world domination. 100 years pass and current Fire Lord Ozai continues to conquer and imprison anyone with elemental ""bending"" abilities in the Earth and Water Kingdoms, while siblings Katara and Sokka from a Southern Water Tribe find a mysterious boy trapped beneath the ice outside their village. Upon rescuing him, he reveals himself to be Aang, Avatar and last of the Air Nomads. Swearing to protect the Avatar, Katara and Sokka journey with him to the Northern Water Kingdom in his quest to master ""Waterbending"" and eventually fulfill his destiny of once again restoring peace to the world. But as they inch nearer to their goal, the group must evade Prince Zuko, the exiled son of Lord Ozai, Commander Zhao, the Fire Nation's military leader, and the tyrannical onslaught of the evil Fire Lord himself.—The Massie Twins The four nations of Air, Water, Earth and Fire lived in harmony until the Fire Nation declared war. A century later, there is still no end in sight to the destruction, then, an Avatar named Aang (Noah Ringer) discovers that he has the power to control the four elements. He joins forces with Katara (Nicola Peltz), a Waterbender, and her brother, Sokka, to restore balance and harmony to their world. The film begins with 14-year-old Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her 15-year-old warrior brother, Sokka (Jackson Rathbone), near a river at the South Pole. They soon followed some tracks of a tiger seal. When they looked beneath their feet, there was something glowing below. An ice sphere appeared with a 12-year-old boy named Aang and a flying bison named Appa trapped inside when Sokka hits the floor with his boomerang. Unknown to them, Aang (Noah Ringer) is the long lost Avatar - a spiritual figure that holds the world in balance through every incarnation. However, his disappearance allowed the Fire Nation to declare war on the other nations (the Air Nomads, the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom) in their attempt to conquer the world.Zuko (Dev Patel), an exhiled prince of the Fire Nation, is on a quest to find the Avatar and bring him as prisoner to his father, the Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis). Seeing the light that appeared from Aang's release, Zuko and some Fire Nation soldiers arrive at the Southern Water Tribe to demand the villagers to bring out their elderly under the impression that the Avatar must be an old person. But Aang reveals himself as he surrenders himself to Zuko on the condition that he agrees to leave the village alone.On the ship Aang is tested by Zuko's Uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub) to confirm him to be the Avatar. After being informed that he is to be their prisoner for passing the test, Aang escapes using his glider and flies to his flying bison brought by Katara and Sokka.Aang and his new friends visit the Southern Air Temple and he learns that he was in the ice for a whole century and that the Fire Nation wiped out all Air Nomads, including his guardian, Monk Gyatso (Damon Gupton). In despair, he enters the Avatar state and finds himself in the spirit world where he encounters a dragon spirit that tells him to make his way to the Northern Water Tribe to master Water Bending.While at small Earth Kingdom town controlled by the Fire Nation, Aang's group is arrested because Katara tries to help a young boy (Isaac Jin Solstein) from a patrol. They incite a rebellion by reminding the disgruntled Earthbenders that earth was given to them. Katara is given a Waterbending scroll that she uses to perfect her Waterbending and help Aang learn Waterbending as they make their way to the Northern Water Tribe and liberate more Earth Kingdom villages in the process.During a side track to the Northern Air Temple on his own, Aang is betrayed by a peasant and captured by a group of Fire Nation archers, led by Admiral Zhao. However, a masked marauder, the ""Blue Spirit"", helps Aang escape from his imprisonment. Aware that Zuko is the ""Blue Spirit"", Zhao arranges to kill the prince. Zuko survives the attempt on his life. With Iroh's help, he sneaks aboard Zhao's lead ship as his fleet departs for the Northern Water Tribe to execute the plan he and Ozai set up with the scrolls from the Library detailing the spirits there.Upon arriving, Aang's group is welcomed warmly by the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe. Immediately, Sokka befriends the Northern Water Tribe princess, Yue (Seychelle Gabriel). After a few agreements, a waterbending master, Pakku (Francis Guinan), teaches Aang waterbending. Soon, the Fire Nation fleet arrives and Zhao begins his attack while Zuko begins his search for the Avatar on his own, capturing Aang as he enters the spirit world to find the dragon spirit to give him the wisdom to defeat the Fire Nation. Returning to his body, Aang battles Zuko before Katara freezes him.As the battle escalates, Iroh watches Zhao capture the moon spirit Tui, which with its water spirit counterpart had assumed the form of a fish. Despite Iroh's pleas, Zhao kills Tui to strip the the Waterbenders to lose all of their powers and abilities to Waterbend. Yue explains to everyone that the moon spirit gave her life, willing to gave it back as she dies in the process. With the tables turned, Zhao is drowned by Waterbenders after Zuko and Iroh leave him to his fate. Aang uses the ocean by forming a gigantic wave to drive the armada back.Aang now fully embraces his destiny as the Avatar as he, Katara and Sokka prepare to continue their journey to the Earth Kingdom to find an earthbending teacher for Aang. When news of Zhao's death and Iroh's betrayal reaches Fire Lord Ozai, he appoints his daughter Azula to capture both her uncle and Zuko along with dealing with the Avatar before Sozin's Comet returns."
Shutter Island,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, two US marshals, are sent to an asylum on a remote island in order to investigate the disappearance of a patient, where Teddy uncovers a shocking truth about the place. In 1954, up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he thinks he's been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals ""escape"" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.—alfiehitchie Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to a government-run institution for the criminally insane on Shutter Island, near Boston, when there is a report that a prisoner has gone missing. Daniels, weighed down with his own baggage, has his own reasons for wanting to get to the island. He is still traumatized from what he saw when his army unit liberated one of the Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, and still haunted by his wife's more-recent death in a fire. The head of the hospital, Dr. John Cawley, treats him decently, but others give the agents a cooler reception. Daniels particularly wants to find out what goes on in the ward that's reserved for the most serious offenders. As he begins to peel away the layers of deceit, it becomes obvious that not all is as it seems.—garykmcd Assigned the thorny task of investigating the incomprehensible disappearance of a deranged child-murderess, troubled U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, travel to Ashecliffe Hospital: Shutter Island's impregnable asylum for the criminally insane. Soon, within the dark purgatory's thick stone walls, indescribable nuances of medical malpractice suggest that the institution's cryptic senior psychiatrists must be hiding something. Then, a raging tempest traps patients and investigators alike in the dark off-shore prison, triggering Teddy's crippling migraines and gruesome flashbacks of a haunting past. Is the already perplexed detective losing his grip on reality?—Nick Riganas In 1954, Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel from Seattle to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient there, Rachel Solando. She had been sectioned at the institution for dangerous criminals at Ashcliffe Hospital because she drowned her three kids. Teddy is a veteran WWII soldier, traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that the management by the Federal facility are obstructing his investigations. Severe migraines hit Teddy as a storm hits the island, and he and Chuck discover that they're stranded. Teddy interviews the internees and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery of Shutter Island.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are on a ferryboat in foggy Boston Harbour headed towards Shutter Island, an island containing a federal mental hospital for the criminally insane. They are going to the island because a woman patient named Rachel escaped the day before. Teddy is very ill, sweating and throwing up in the toilet, telling himself to get it together, it's just water. Then he looks out the window and says it's a LOT of water. He goes up on deck to talk to Chuck, and it's apparent that they are new partners working for the first time together. During their conversation it is revealed that Teddy's wife died in an apartment fire several years before. Chuck is sorry he brought it up. He refers to Teddy as boss all the way through the movie, and at one point mentions that Teddy is a legend, so we know that Teddy is well known through the Marshal Service and that he is Chuck's superior.They get to the island, and the ferry captain mentions that there is a big storm coming. Teddy and Chuck meet the deputy warden, McPherson, who takes them into the mental hospital grounds. There are high walls that make it look like a prison, and electrified wire on the perimeter, but the actual buildings and grounds look almost like a college campus. There is the A building, housing the male patients, B building for the women patients, and C building which is situated on the highest point of the island and we are told it was a civil war fortress. It houses the most dangerous patients and the marshals are told that under no circumstances are they to go there on their own without McPherson and Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) accompanying them. There is a brief argument when deputy warden McPherson requires them to give up their firearms. Teddy says that they are federal agents, but McPherson tells them that federal penitentiary law overrides that and says that they won't get through the gates with their weapons. They reluctantly give them up, with Chuck rather clumsily removing his holster from his pants, which gets him a look from McPherson and Teddy.They meet Dr. Cawley, who explains a bit about the facility and psychiatry. Dr. Cawley says that there is a war going on in psychiatry, with one faction who believes in surgical techniques like lobotomies to treat patients, where another side says that the new psychotropic drugs are the way to treat people. He believes that sometimes just listening to a patient and quietly making their life comfortable is the way to go. Teddy still has a splitting headache from the ferry trip, and the doctor gives him some water and some pills that he says are aspirin. He explains that Rachel, a patient, has escaped the night before but says that it's impossible because she seems to have simply vanished through the walls. She is at Shutter Island because she drowned three of her children one by one, and then pretended that they had never died. In fact, she believes that she is still at her home at the hospital, and all of the staff and other inmates are merely neighbours or deliverymen that she encounters in her daily life. She refuses to accept that she has killed anyone, or even that her children are dead.They tour the rest of the island, where officers are looking for the escaped Rachel. There is a lighthouse on the other side of the island that is gated off and there are armed guards, which makes Teddy a little suspicious.Teddy makes it clear that his job is to interview staff and patients. He says he needs the personnel records of the staff, but the doctor kind of blows that off. They go to the patient living quarters and interview staff about the night that Rachel left. In her cell, there is a loose floorboard and a handwritten note from her, saying ""The law of 4. Who is 67?"". The staff are less than helpful at the meeting that Teddy and Chuck have to ask about her, but do note that she had attended group therapy right before she went to her room and disappeared. During the meeting, it is revealed that she has a staff physician who conducted the meeting, a Dr. Shaheen. When Teddy asks where he is, Dr. Cawley says he just left that morning on the ferry to go on a long planned vacation. Teddy is incredulous that a dangerous mental patient has just escaped, there's a lockdown, and her doctor is allowed to just go on vacation. Things definitely look suspicious at this point.There are a series of dream sequences interspersed, flashbacks about Teddy's time in WWII as a soldier, and Teddy often has internal conversations with himself in which his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), talks to him and gives him advice. In one flashback, Teddy's unit is the first to liberate the Dachau concentration camp. There are many dead Jews. Teddy is especially moved by a dead woman and her dead daughter in her arms in the middle of a pile of dead bodies. Teddy remembers watching the German Camp Commander attempt suicide by shooting himself, but he only wounds himself, shooting himself in the side of his face. The German tries to reach his gun to finish the job, but Teddy slowly slides the gun away with his foot just out of reach of the German, watching him suffer before he bleeds to death. In other dreams, his wife discovering that he has a lot of empty bottles of alcohol that he has hidden around the house. He explains that the things he saw while in Germany are the reason why he drinks so much.After the meeting with staff, Dr. Cawley has Teddy and Chuck over to his mansion on the island to have a cigar and something to drink. When they arrive, there is a Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) in the den, and he seems to be Dr. Cawley's superior. Teddy takes an instant dislike to him when he notices a faint German accent, and the two verbally spar for a little bit. Dr. Naehring is amused, commenting on Teddy's remarkable defence mechanisms. Dr. Naehring calls Teddy and Chuck men of violence, which offends Chuck. But the doctor says he doesn't mean that they are violent men, only that they are men who have seen violence and don't shy away from it if necessary. He correctly surmises that they were both in the army during WWII, and that they weren't raised to run away from violence. Teddy gets angry when they say that they've consulted the board of directors who have refused to release the staff's personnel records, angry enough that Teddy breaks a glass, threatens to end the investigation in the morning and turn his findings over to the FBI, and storms off in a huff.The next day, the storm has hit the island and it is clear the ferry will not arrive. Teddy was only bluffing the night before as he has no intention of leaving without investigating the island some more. Teddy and Chuck have several interviews with the patients who were in the group therapy session with Rachel. They are unhelpful and all seem to be following a script because they say very similar things in their interviews. In one interview, a woman asks Chuck for a glass of water and when he leaves, she grabs Teddy's notebook and writes something very quickly and gives it back to him.He and Chuck leave the hospital grounds and explore the island, ending up at the cemetery. The wind and rain are picking up and they find sanctuary in a cemetery vault. Chuck asks Teddy to level with him; he suspects that the last patient told him something while he was getting her water, and Teddy finally shows him the notebook, and it says RUN. Teddy finally explains that he was trying to get assigned to an investigation of the mental hospital for some time. He says that a man named Laeddis was a maintenance worker at the apartment they lived in and he was the arsonist who set the fire that killed his wife. He got off on a technicality, but later was caught when he killed some other people. He was sent to the mental hospital here. But when Teddy looked into it, there was no paperwork at all for Laeddis, and he suspects that there is some greater conspiracy going on. He mentions the Nazi experiments and wonders if his own government is involved in psychotropic drug research as well. He tells Chuck that he came across a prisoner by the name of George Noyce who was actually sent here some time before and he was the one who clued Teddy in that there was some crazy research going on here.Chuck suddenly gets paranoid that maybe in all of Teddy's poking around he alerted the wrong people to his interest in Shutter Island and that maybe they arranged the disappearance of Rachel as an excuse to draw him here as a Marshal to investigate where they could make both of them disappear. Teddy is not sure that's possible, but Chuck is pretty convincing and suddenly, the door busts in and there is a car spotlight on them from dep. Warden McPherson's car. Hes been looking for them and they get in and he takes them back to the hospital. They change out of their wet business suits, and the orderly gives them the staff white uniforms that almost make them look like patients, and he tells them that it will take a day or two to get their suits back. They don't like the whites but take them anyway. The orderly says their cigarettes were ruined (they both smoke a lot), but he gives them two new packs of cigs.They meet in Dr. Cawley's office again. They argue briefly about the investigation, and suddenly Teddy gets ill again, a migraine. He thinks he'll be okay, but then he starts to fall and Chuck catches him. The doctor gives him a couple of pills, but Teddy doesn't want to take them. Hes really sick, though, and the doctor almost insists that he take them, and he does. Chuck helps him down to the basement with all the rest of the staff to wait out the hurricane like storm. Just before he dozes off, he sees a sinister looking guy, who an orderly says is the warden (Ted Levine, the killer from Silence of the Lambs). The warden kind of sneers at Teddy right before Teddy falls asleep.Teddy has another dream sequence with his wife, who tells him that Rachel is on the island, and that he needs to help her. In a dream, Teddy is in Dr. Cawley's den, and Laeddis (Elias Koteas) in his chair by the fire. Laeddis has a really nasty scar running from his right eye down to the left side of his chin, and his left eye is milky white.The next day is kind of chaotic. The backup generators fail, and all of the patients' cell doors were therefore opened. Trees are fallen all over the hospital campus with staff and officers trying to clean up as well as gather up all of the wandering patients. Teddy and Chuck use this as an opportunity to go up to C building while no one is really paying attention to them. The place is really dark inside and they wander around. A patient runs from them and they give chase. Chuck falls behind and the patient grabs Teddy from behind and is choking him. Teddy gets away and beats the crap out of him until Chuck pulls him off. A guard chews out Teddy and has Chuck help him take the patient to the medical centre, telling Teddy to take a walk and cool off.Teddy wanders around and finds a row of cells where a prisoner is sitting by himself and saying the name Laeddis. When Teddy demands the prisoner look at him, he realizes it is George Noyce, the guy who was a former patient here who told him about what was going on at Shutter Island. Noyce's face is badly beaten. Teddy can't believe he is back here and Noyce is yelling at him that its all about Laeddis, isn't it? He tells Teddy that the only way he can save Noyce is to forget his wife and Laeddis and focus on what is going on here. Teddy looks guilty when Noyce tells him it is his fault that Noyce is back here because he kept inquiring about Laeddis. Teddy promises that he'll get Noyce out of there. Noyce tells him that Laeddis is no longer in C building, but that they have taken him to the lighthouse, where they are planning to do a lobotomy on him. He says that the lighthouse is where they do a lot of their experiments on people who are troublemakers. Noyce questions him about Noyce, implying that he is a plant by the government to follow Teddy. He asks him whether hes ever worked with Chuck before, and we know that they haven't because they let us know that in the beginning.Teddy finally catches up with Chuck and they head towards the office. Dr. Cawley says they found Rachel (Emily Mortimer). They go to her cell and there is a weird scene where Teddy tries to talk to her and she ultimately thinks he is her dead husband and starts yelling at him.At some point, Teddy's dream sequences now include Rachel as the woman with her daughter in the pile of bodies at Dachau. And this time they open their eyes and look at him. The girl asks him why he didn't save her. He says he tried but they (the soldiers) just didnt get there in time. In another scene, Rachel is all bloody but she is at Teddy and his wife's vacation cottage. They go outside and Teddy sees the little girl and picks her up and carries her to the water. The little girl asks him again why he didn't save her and he looks sad.Teddy and Chuck leave and Chuck says he found Laeddis's file but there was only his commitment paper in the file which he tries to show Teddy but he wont look at it now because he is intent on reaching the lighthouse. Teddy is acting suspicious of Chuck when he tries to talk him out of going to the lighthouse. They arrive at the cliffs over the ocean and realize they are too far south of the lighthouse. Teddy says he is going to go around and try to get there a different way. Again Chuck tries to talk him out of it because it's dangerous to scale the cliffs when it will be dark soon. They argue some more and Teddy tells him he is going by himself. Teddy gets near the lighthouse but finds that it is late enough in the day that the tide has cut off the lighthouse from the island. He gives up and goes back to where Chuck is to tell him they'll try later. But all he sees is a burning cigarette on the edge of the cliff (it's about a hundred feet down to the rocks below). He looks over and sees Chuck at the bottom of the cliff with waves crashing over him.Shocked, Teddy climbs down the cliff but doesn't see Chuck at the bottom. He sees a cave in the side of the cliff with a fire burning inside. When he reaches the cave, he sees a woman armed with a knife. They begin talking and she says she is Rachel (Patricia Clarkson), but that she was a doctor at the hospital who found out too much and they committed her and concocted a story that she killed her kids. The other Rachel must be an imposter they used to fool Teddy and Chuck. She says there is a secret government program to test a number of new drugs on the patients to make them sort of super spies or soldiers who don't feel pain and don't have memories that can be tortured out of them if they are captured. She then warns Teddy that they will not let him leave. They will concoct a story that he went crazy. She asks him if he had a serious trauma (his wife dying), and says that they will use that to say that he cracked. She asks him if he has taken any medication (he has; the aspirin for his headaches). She asks if he's eaten at the hospital, or smoked any of their cigarettes (the orderly gave him a new pack when his clothes were all wet). She says that it takes 36-48 hours for psychotropic drugs to take effect and make him pliable for them to control. The first sign will be tremors in his hands, which he already has. She also questions whether Chuck is even a Marshal, that he is probably a government agent sent to go with him to the island.When Teddy gets back to the road, he sees a jeep pull up with the warden. The warden takes him back to the facility and they have a really weird conversation about being men of violence. The warden tells him that men like them know how to use violence and use it well. He asks Teddy if he were to reach over and try to bite his eye out, would Teddy be able to stop him. Teddy says ""why don't you try and well find out?"". The warden smiles and says that's the Teddy he was expecting.Teddy leaves to confront Dr. Cawley. Dr. Cawley wonders where Teddy has been. Teddy says he'll be leaving and he asks if the doctor has seen Chuck, his partner. Dr. Cawley says he came to the island alone, there was no partner. Teddy realizes that they are already starting to put their plan in action by insisting there was no Chuck. He leaves and walks around the grounds, trying to decide what to do next. He sees his wife, who tells him to leave the island and don't go to the lighthouse. She says the lighthouse will destroy him.He decides to blow up Dr. Cawley's car to create a diversion so he can sneak down to the lighthouse. He uses his tie from his suit, soaks it with gas from the gas tank, and lights it. As he moves away from the car, he sees his wife and the little girl in front of the car. It explodes around them but they aren't burned at all. He runs out of there to make it to the lighthouse. He swims over to it, and sneaks up behind a guard and overpowers him and takes his rifle. The guard asks him if he is going to kill him and he says no, but hits him with the rifle butt and knocks him out. He runs up the stairs of the lighthouse to the top, checking each room but finding no operating rooms for surgical experiments.He gets to the top and finds Dr. Cawley, sitting behind a desk. Teddy holds the rifle on him while he is talking. The doctor tells him there are no bullets in the rifle, and asks him if he killed the guard below. Teddy says no, but the doctor calls down anyway to tell the people below to attend to the guard before they come up. Teddy sees his gun from the beginning of the movie on the doctors desk.Dr. Cawley tells Teddy that he is a patient at the hospital, and has been for two years. Teddy doesn't believe him, and says that he is a U.S. Marshal. The doctor says he was one, but after his breakdown two years ago he was sent here. He broke down when his kids were killed. Teddy says he doesn't have any kids. Dr. Cawley says they have been trying to use the new drug therapy to help him and have been trying to do everything they could to treat him. Dr. Cawley tells him that he has been one of the most dangerous patients they have had and that there are some who want to lobotomize him to make him manageable. The whole last couple of days were an attempt to do a massive role-play to get him to finally realize the truth. He calls in Dr. Sheehan, the doctor from the beginning that went on vacation right after his patient Rachel disappeared. The door opens and it is .Chuck! He is a psychiatrist who agreed to play along with Teddy's fantasy and to keep tabs on him. Dr. Cawley tells Teddy that his real name is Laeddis, and he shows him on a chalkboard that his full name and Laeddis's are an anagram; that is, all the letters in his name can be rearranged to spell Laeddis's full name. The same thing with his wife's name and Rachel's. Teddy constructed the new name Teddy Daniels to create distance from his real name.The doctor points out that Noyce was a fellow patient who Teddy attacked a few days before, and that was why he was all beaten up looking. Teddy denies this, but the doctor shows him the transcript of what Noyce said to him in the cell earlier, where he said this was all Teddy's fault. He tells Teddy that the reason why he beat up Noyce was that Noyce called him by his real name.Teddy grabs his gun off the table and shoots Dr. Cawley, whose blood splashes against the wall. The next second, there is no blood. Dr. Cawley tells him that his gun was a toy gun they gave him when they began the role-play.He tells Teddy that he has completely erased everything he did wrong in an attempt to make himself be the hero. We finally see a flashback where Teddy/Laeddis comes home to his cottage from a week or two of chasing bad guys in Oklahoma. His wife (Michelle Williams) is acting strangely. He asks where the kids are and she says they are in school. He says it's Saturday, and she smiles and says, they're in HER school and looks towards the lake. Horrified, Teddy runs down to the lake and sees his three children face down in the lake. He scoops them all up, crying uncontrollably and places them on the ground. Then his wife hugs him and says they should put the kids at the dining room table and have dinner. Teddy is crying and says if she ever loved him, please stop talking. She is sad now and says she loves him and then there is a shot. Teddy looks down and realizes that he just shot his wife. She is laying there with a lot of blood on her and then she dies.Teddy now realizes that he has a choice between accepting his truth or continuing to deny it. The doctor makes it clear that if he can't accept the truth, then Dr. Cawley won't be able to stop the other doctors from ordering that he be lobotomized. He makes Teddy admit that he blamed himself for not realizing earlier that his wife was having trouble. That he feels responsible for killing his kids because he didn't get her help when she needed it. He created a fantasy world where he never killed his wife, and he never had a breakdown.The next day, he and Chuck (Dr. Shaheen), are sitting on some steps by the hospital grounds. He asks Chuck what their next move is (as if he still believes he is investigating the hospital as a U.S. Marshal), and Chuck says, what do you think, boss? Chuck nods to the other doctors across the grounds who then direct some orderlies to move towards Teddy. Teddy asks Chuck whether it's better to live as a monster or die a good man. He stands up and willingly goes with the orderlies, as he would rather choose to continue his fantasy than accept the horrors of his reality.Alternatively, he has accepted his reality, but still cannot live with the horrors of it. So now at the end of the film he is actually acting out the fantasy, rather than living it. Effectively, he is cured. However, he still can't live with his memories so he knowingly forces the doctors to take the decision for physical intervention, ie the lobotomy, knowing he will no longer have to live with his memories as a compliant 'zombie'..Thus ending his life as a good man.(As contrary in the Book,where the author ended the book with him still as Teddy)"
The Other Guys,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386588/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two mismatched New York City detectives seize an opportunity to step up like the city's top cops, whom they idolize, only things don't quite go as planned. Terry Hoitz's past mistakes in the line of duty and Allen Gamble's reluctance to take risks have landed them the roles of the ""Other Guys"", disgraced New York City police detectives relegated to filling out paperwork for cocky hero cops Danson and Highsmith. The mismatched duo must look past their differences when they take on a high-profile investigation of shady capitalist David Ershon and attempt to fill the shoes of the notoriously reckless officers they idolize.—The Massie Twins Officers Danson and Highsmith are the two best cops that New York City has to offer. However when they take on an assignment that proves for them to be too much to handle, they are killed in the line of duty. With New York now devoid of its heroes, a void needs to be filled. The entire department is scrambling to fill the fallen heroes' shoes. But now Alan Gamble, a seemingly bland and dull forensics accountant, and his partner Terry Hoitz, who earned the nickname ""The Yankee Clipper"" and is universally known for having shot Derek Jeter during game 7 of the World Series, have broken the case open thanks to Gamble's investigation of faulty scaffolding equipment. Now desperate to see some action, Gamble and Hoitz will leave their desks to take on the case of a lifetime that will see their partnership come to the ultimate test, as well as the relationships they have with their significant others. Will Gamble and Hoitz live to tell about it, or will they just be the other guys?—halo1k Following the death of two experienced, all star cops, one pair of insignificant, feeble cops try to take their place. They are Allen Gamble, a nonsensical police accountant, and Terry Hoitz, a streetwise detective who shot Derek Jeter. While trying to get along with each other, they stumble upon a scaffolding permit violation that turns into a huge case involving a major corporation and a sucker they are trying to target.—BonQuieQuie Jackson Things have never been better for the bustling New York City, as the highly trained, no-nonsense NYPD detectives, P.K. Highsmith and Christopher Danson, have managed to eradicate crime in town, unavoidably, at a small cost. However, when an unforeseen complication incapacitates the hardcore crime-fighting duo during a cinematic high-speed chase, the volatile situation calls for the department's least intimidating desk jockeys--the pacifist, Allen Gamble, and his reluctant companion, Terry Hoitz--to fill the gap. Now, the city needs a brand-new pair of heroes to defend it; nevertheless, are the boys up to the task?—Nick Riganas Officers PK Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Chris Danson (Dwayne Johnson) are the most bad ass cops that New York City has ever seen. The movie opens with them engaged in a high speed chase creating a wanton destruction path of every block that they cross. They do manage to capture the criminals at high speeds. However the infraction they picked them up for was very minor and they manage to do a lot of damage. They are also hailed as heroes and are given the key to the city by the mayor.Back at the station they're also greeted as heroes and treated like celebrities. There's several pairs of officers including Martin and Fosse, officer Bob (who makes announcements about banal activities at inappropriate times) and the other guys - Alan Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), They're admired by Allen Gamble, a by the numbers forensic accountant who is very straight laced and doesn't take any risks. Gamble's partner Terry Hoitz disagrees and he's grown tired of his desk job and wants to see some real hard core action. To make matters worse, Gamble is duped into a prank by fellow officers Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans Jr.) by firing his gun randomly in the air and he has it taken away. Hoitz also had his gun taken away thanks to a past incident involving working security at game 7 of the World Series and shooting Derek Jeter (Derek Jeter)in the process. Thanks to that incident, he has unwittingly earned the nickname ""The Yankee Clipper"". Gamble also has earned an unflattering nickname around the office: ""Paper Bitch"". At a support group for gun abuse Hoitz and Gamble don't know why they're there and Hoitz doesn't want to be there.The next day Highsmith and Danson are called into the field. This case has them chasing suspects in a jewelry store robbery. Once again they're chasing a suspect robbing a jewelry store up a high rise. The robber manages to escape using a zip line, and to follow him, they're planning to jump off a high rise and into the bushes. Unfortunately they miss and hit the pavement instead. No one really knows why they decided to jump. They're given a heroes' funeral by the city of New York. Without their hottest officers, the department turns to Hoitz and Gamble instead. At the funeral Hoitz and Gamble nearly start a brawl with some of the other detectives while the Captain (Michael Keaton). Hoitz decides that the void left by Highsmith and Danson needs to be filled and that someone is them.Hoitz desperately wants a taste of action. But unfortunately as he's paired with Gamble, Gamble is obsessed with a case involving faulty scaffolding being installed at a construction site. But then they get a call about shots being fired and cocaine at the scene. Hoitz forces Gamble out of the office to take to the case. As they finally get some field work, Hoitz discovers that Gamble is even lamer than he originally thought. Their first taste of action ends incredibly poorly when Gamble floors the accelerator on his red Prius and crashes into the crime scene.We are then introduced to billionaire investor David Ershon (Steve Coogan). Hoitz is still demeaning Gamble about everything he does isn't manly enough. They also berate officer Bob about the company picnic next week. They then meet Ershon at the contstruction site. Gamble arrests Ershon but fails to read his Miranda Rights properly. While transporting Ershon back to the station, Gamble has an accident with some very suspicious people who then steal Gamble's Prius and kidnap Ershon.Gamble and Hoitz decide that they need a fresh start while wandering the streets of New York City. Back at the station, they have a new case and that's to find out who kidnapped Ershon. Hoitz goes over to Gamble's house where he learns more about Gamble including the fact that Gamble has a super model wife named Sheila (Eva Mendes) who also happens to be a well respected doctor. Gamble acts like it's no big deal. Gamble learns who stole his Prius and it turns out that when it was stolen some homeless people performed some very unspeakable acts in the back seat. They also find Gamble's lost iPhone. The group of homeless people is known as ""Dirty Mike & The Boys"". The bad news about Gamble's car just keeps coming.The next day at a restaurant Gamble is showing off the smart phone app that he created that shows what a person's face looks like if you take a picture of the back of their head. Gamble and Hoitz then go to interview the next witness who also happens to be a former ex-girlfriend of Gamble's - another unbelievably attractive woman. However she is married and Hoitz manages to offend the woman by mispronouncing her name.Hoitz really wants to know what Gamble's deal with hot ladies is. While sitting in the Prius, they get a message from Ershon. The next day while at a local bar singing about their woes, Gamble and Hoitz discover that Ershon is up to something involving the state Lottery and some suspicious activity. Hoitz then goes to meet with his girlfriend, a dance instructor, who it turns out he has some issues with. Unfortunately Gamble awkwardly shows up and makes things worse than they were.The next day driving into the city, Gamble and Hoitz have an incredibly awkward moment which ends with another fight and Gamble playing his favorite music - the Little River Band. They go to the next stop on their list - another accounting firm - which ends with the store front they're going to exploding. Gamble is tired of the explosions and gun fights and wants to go back to his desk. Hoitz on the other hand disagrees and tells Gamble that life is loud and has incidents like this. Gamble then reveals about his past in college - he was essentially a glorified pimp. He made money working security for the college's attractive women and was very well paid. He attracted a huge group of women to his flock and earned the real nickname of ""Gator"". He decided to leave that life behind after an incident where he went to the emergency room and met Shelia, who he would later go on to marry and that's why he's as straight laced as he is.After that they go to meet Ershon, back at his accounting firm. They confront Ershon about his penny pinching and they don't know what he's up to with the state Lottery but they definitely suspect that he's up to something, they just can't quite put their finger on it. Ershon offers them a bribe of court side seats to the latest Knicks game, but they don't know that it's actually a bribe. The next day Ershon ups the ante by offering them tickets to the musical ""Jersey Boys"".Hoitz and Gamble learn that Ershon has employed some incredibly shady losses to cover his tracks on some bad investments. But Hoitz's aggressive tactics don't exactly earn him points. While at Ershon's offices they're confronted by some incredibly shady people in the parking lot. Hoitz and Gamble are then kidnapped and are being transported on a train in Gamble's Prius. They call the station and their captain where they tell them that they're in Las Vegas and were transported by train there. The captain then grills them about laying off Ershon despite that he's committed some criminal activity.Back at the station, the captain is grilling Hoitz and Gamble about their investigation into Ershon Construction and Ershon's shady business practices. The captain has a change of heart and removes Gamble's wooden gun but gives him a whistle as a replacement. The captain then orders all the evidence they have on Ershon turned over to the FBI. Later they're given orders about the police pension fund and that there's a vote being held on it next week.Hoitz then goes to his girlfriend's art gallery which ends extremely poorly when he manages to trash a piece of very expensive modern art - which he doesn't know is modern art. Meanwhile at Gamble's house, he is discussing the case with Shelia and that he's essentially done with that. Shelia reveals that she's pregnant and that causes Gamble to get in a fight, which she then kicks him out of the house. Later the next night, Gamble and Hoitz decide that they're both depressed about their troubles with their women and don't know what to do next. They're also confronted by Dirty Mike & The Boys. After that they decide to go on a bender to end all benders.Hoitz and Gamble then go to interview the next witness - who happens to be Ershon's lawyer. Unfortunately they accidentally hand all of the evidence they've gathered against Ershon over to him. Back at the station, Hoitz is extremely angry about the fact that they just handed over all the evidence. They then get a call over the police banner about a possible jumper from a high rise. Gamble tells Hoitz that he has previous experience about hostage negotiation. But it ends rather poorly when Gamble gets on the PA and has an extremely poor choice of words that has the jumper jumping. The jumper also happened to work for Ershon.The incident has Gamble and Hoitz losing their partnership and they're then demoted. We hear a monologue from Highsmith about what a man has to do to pick himself up once he gets his ass kicked. Gamble is still obsessed about the conspiracy theory involving Ershon and the lottery. Gamble thinks that the jewelry heist that Danson and Highsmith were chasing was actually a distraction for an even bigger robbery taking place behind the scenes. He investigates exactly what the thieves were doing when they took such a small amount of diamonds and escaped using a 20 story military grade zip line. They're them demoted and reassigned to traffic duty while other officers are glad to be taking over the case. While on the beat, Hoitz and Gamble both discover that there's other links to the case. Hoitz and Gamble then reunite and decide that to get back on the boss's good graces that they really need to go after Ershon. Gamble reveals that Ershon is covering his tracks by using two accounting firms and that he needs to be arrested for grand larceny. Hoitz tells Gamble that he's no longer interested in the case and that he enjoys working traffic. Gamble then forces Hoitz at gun point that he needs his partner to be on his case.Hoitz and Gamble then go to confront the captain while working at his alternate job at Bed, Bath, & Beyond, the captain is working the second job to pay his son's obscene college tuition. Hoitz and Gamble formulate a plan to take down Ershon by confronting him at his construction company. At Ershon's company he is having a meeting with his stock holders about the company's future. One of the investors happens to be fellow officer Bob, who they berated earlier about a proxy vote. Hoitz has come to a revelation that they're targeting the police pension fund. It turns out that Gamble was right with his theory that the jewelry heist that Danson and Highsmith were chasing was just a distraction for an even bigger robbery that was taking place behind the scenes involving Ershon. At the vote, Hoitz is stunned to learn that fellow Officer Bob is a part of the vote. Hoitz then comes to a shocking revelation that Lendel Global is targeting the police pension fund and that they stand to profit handsomely if the vote goes in their favor. A massive shoot out ensues. They get in a car chase involving Ershon and Gamble's completely destroyed Prius while his lame taste in easy listening music prevails.Ershon then reveals his involvement in some incredibly shady activity. They then take Ershon to his very small apartment. Ershon reveals that a money transfer is going to be involved and that the money involved goes directly to the police pension fund. Gamble then goes to reconcile his differences with Shelia, while Hoitz goes to reconcile his differences with his girlfriend. Hoitz desperately tries to pick up Gamble's girlfriend while they decide that either of them doesn't know what is going to happen the next day. Gamble then goes to his house and reconciles with Shelia. Meanwhile officers Martin and Fosse are lecturing a class of school children about poor decisions they will make in their lives and follows the call from Gamble and Hoitz.The next morning it's time for the bank transfer. Gamble of course has the proper sound track and his lame taste in easy listening music once again prevails. Gamble then shocks everyone with some high speed driving in his Prius. But it ends badly when they get into a horrific accident. But they then survive thanks to Gamble's jack knifing abilities. Meanwhile some of the other officers are giving a lecture to some school kids about how police work isn't proper action and decide to bring one of them along. It ends rather poorly when a helicopter starts shooting at the Prius and the ride along gets in an accident following Hoitz and Gamble. They're followed by a huge flock of police cars but manage to escape by hiding in a double level parking lot. Ershon is then pursued by another group of shady people. The chase ends with them on a golf course driving range and they manage to destroy the helicopter, but unfortunately it also destroys Gamble's Prius. The other officers are also in pursuit of Ershon and manage to get to the transfer before it happens. They hold the investors at gun point and manage to arrest everyone involved.Ershon is arrested and taken into custody. It's revealed that he is using his time in prison to make investments and further his shady accounting practices. Hoitz and Gamble are hailed as heroes for their ability to bring Ershon to justice. Thankfully Gamble's smart phone app was able to nail most of the criminals involved in the transfer. Hoitz manages to marry his girlfriend and wanted Shelia to be his best man, but she declines for very obvious reasons. While getting food at Nathan's on Coney Island, Gamble and Hoitz are greeted by none other than Derek Jeter. Jeter tells Hoitz that he was setup the night he was shot, and gives them their next assignment. Their next case involves the biggest shady investment firm in the world - Goldman Sachs - and where Gamble once again manages to attract another hot woman. While leaving Hoitz very badly wants to know what Gamble's secret is, and Gamble reveals who he lost his virginity to - none other than supermodel Heather Locklear. The film ends with a monologue from Highsmith about how every police department is the same - you have your star officers. You have your 9 to 5 officers. And then there's these guys - the other guys. During the credits we are shown a slide show presentation set to the tune of Cee Lo Green's ""Pimps Don't Cry"" about billionaires, income inequality, stock swindlers and Bernie Madoff."
Salt,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944835/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A CIA agent goes on the run after a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent and highly respected by all, including her boss, Ted Winter. Out of the blue, a Russian spy walks into their offices and offers a vital piece of information: the President of Russia will be assassinated during his forthcoming visit to New York City to attend the funeral of the recently deceased U.S. Vice President. The name of the assassin: Evelyn Salt. Concerned about the safety of her husband, who she cannot contact, she goes on the run. Winter refuses to accept that she is a mole or a double agent but her actions begin to raise doubts. Just who is Evelyn Salt and what is she planning?—garykmcd A Russian calling himself Orlov and claiming to be FSB walks into undercover CIA offices in Washington DC wanting to defect. He says that he has information on a Russian sleeper cell, whose members were trained since they were children. Their mission is to infiltrate the American system by being one of them, ultimately with the goal of bringing down the United States starting on a specified day - code ""Day X"" - which will begin with the assassination of the current Russian President in New York City at the upcoming funeral of the American Vice-President. The CIA interrogator deems Orlov a crackpot until he names the agent tasked with killing the Russian president: Evelyn Salt. The importance of this last piece of information is that Evelyn Salt is the CIA operative currently in the room with him as his CIA interrogator, her name which he does and should not know in the current context. Darryl Peabody with CIA counter-intelligence, who is monitoring the interrogation, feels he needs to question Evelyn before she leaves the building as a matter of proper protocol. Evelyn, denying all accusations, decides instead to make a run for it, she states all in an effort to save her husband, German arachnologist Mike Krause, who she believes has been targeted as part of the Russian plot against her. Beyond love, her devotion to Mike is largely because he, before knowing of her work as a CIA agent, helped negotiate her release from North Korean captivity two years earlier when she was in special ops in the field, that captivity which included torture. The longer Evelyn is on the run, the more she looks guilty to the American authorities pursuing her. Although helping Peabody and his team try to capture Evelyn, Ted Winter, her CIA colleague, is the only person seemingly who believes she is innocent of the accusations. There may be others in the Russian cell in positions of American authority who may be part of the plot if Orlov's story in the general sense is to be believed, they who may be trying to help or stop Evelyn, depending if she is truly part of the cell.—Huggo As a CIA officer, Evelyn Salt swore an oath to duty, honor and country. Her loyalty will be tested when a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. Salt goes on the run, using all her skills and years of experience as a covert operative to elude capture. Salt's efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: ""Who is Salt?""—Sony Pictures Two years ago, the CIA field agent Evelyn Salt is captured in North Korea and tortured. Her beloved husband and entomologist Mike Krause presses the US Government to make a swap and bring Salt back home. On the present days, the highly efficient Salt performs administrative work with her boss Ted Winter. When a Russian defector turns himself in to CIA, Salt is assigned to interrogate him. Out of the blue, the man accuses Salt of being a Russian agent in charge of killing the President of Russia during his visit to New York to attend the funeral of the American Vice-President. Salt claims that she is innocent and asks Ted to call her husband, but she is not successful in her attempt. Salt asks Ted to give protection to her husband but she decides to flee to seek out Mike. Ted does not believe she is a Russian spy but the Secret Agent Peabody orders his agents to capture Salt dead or alive.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is tortured in a prison in North Korea on suspicion of being a U.S. spy. Her boyfriend, Arachnologist Mike Krause (August Diehl), generates so much publicity about Salt's imprisonment that the CIA is forced to arrange a prisoner exchange despite the agency's policy against it. Salt's CIA colleague Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) greets Salt at the border. As they drive away, Mike proposes marriage, despite Salt's admission to Mike that she is, in fact, a CIA operative. Mike is acknowledged as the world's top Arachnologist.Two years later, on Salt and Krause's wedding anniversary, a Russian defector named Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) walks into Salt's office. Salt interrogates him with Winter and CIA counter-intelligence officer Darryl Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) observing. Orlov claims that on ""Day X"", highly trained Russian sleeper agents known as ""KAs"" will destroy the U.S. Orlov tells a story how KAs were recruited by the KGB when they were practically babies and trained to be Russian spies to infiltrate the highest levels of the US government. He claims that the program started with Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to Russia in 1959. But the man who returned to US was not Oswald but a Russian spy named Alek, who killed JFK. Similarly, many Russian agents (trained from childhood up) were substituted for US citizens when they visited USSR.Orlov tells them that Agent ""KA-12"" will assassinate Russian president Boris Matveyev (Olek Krupa) at the funeral of the American Vice President. Orlov reveals that KA-12 is named Evelyn Salt, and lie detectors confirm his entire story. Peabody orders Salt be detained, while Orlov kills two agents and escapes. In the confusion, Salt is able to escape from the building, running barefoot through the street. While the CIA is searching for her, Salt returns home and discovers that her husband, Mike, was kidnapped. Salt searches the apartment with her dog, and gathers survival supplies, weapons, and one of her husband's spiders in a jar. She leaves her dog with a child from a neighboring apartment and resumes her escape.A day later at the funeral of the US Vice President, Salt enters the church despite heavy security (she had dyed her hair black), Salt shoots President Matveyev (by caving the floor and dropping him a lever below, where she gets a few seconds alone with him before the security arrives) and then surrenders herself to Peabody instead of killing him. Matveyev is pronounced dead. Salt escapes again and heads to a barge where Orlov is hiding with other sleeper agents. In a series of flashbacks, Salt recalls growing up in the Soviet Union and being trained with other children. She recalls being switched with an American girl, the real Evelyn Salt, after the girl and her parents died in a car crash in the Soviet Union. This gains her access to America by assuming the deceased Evelyn's identity.
On the barge, Orlov welcomes her back and has her husband killed in front of her. When Salt shows no reaction, Orlov is convinced she is loyal and begins briefing her on her next assignment. She is to rendezvous with another KA who will help her assassinate the American president. Salt then turns and kills Orlov and the other agents before leaving.
She then meets with the unaware KA Shnaider (Corey Stoll), who uses his cover as a Czech NATO liaison to get Salt into the White House by disguising her as a man. Once inside, Shnaider launches a suicide attack to force agents to move the President (Hunt Block) to an underground bunker, accompanied by Winter. Salt follows them and manages to enter the bunker before it is sealed.The U.S. president learns that Russia has mobilized its nuclear arsenal in response to their president's murder. He orders U.S. nuclear weapons readied in response. After seeing Evelyn has entered the bunker, Winter surprisingly kills everyone except the President. He introduces himself as Nikolai Tarkovsky, another member of the KA. Winter incapacitates the President and begins aiming nuclear missiles at Mecca and Tehran to incite a billion Muslims against the United States. Salt tries to persuade Winter to let her inside the sealed room, but then he sees a television report saying President Matveyev is alive and well; Salt had laced spider venom into the bullet she used to shoot Matveyev, simulating death. Winter refuses her entry and reveals that Mike's kidnapping and murder and her blown cover were all his idea. Winter plans to place full blame for the nuclear attacks on Salt. Salt breaks into the room before he can launch the missiles. The two wrestle for control of the nuclear football, with Salt aborting the missile strikes before being captured.As Salt is being led out in chains, Winter grabs a pair of scissors planning to kill her as she is led past him. She unexpectedly hooks her handcuff chain around Winter's neck and jumps over the stair railing, strangling him to death. On the helicopter ride to be interrogated, Peabody questions her. Salt explains that she killed Winter because he orchestrated the death of her husband, and promises to hunt down the remaining KA agents if freed, offering the fact she earlier let Peabody live as proof, as well as the fact she did not actually kill the Russian President. Peabody is convinced after receiving a text that Salt's fingerprints were found on the barge where the sleeper agents were killed, supporting her story. Salt is allowed to escape, jumping out of the helicopter into the Potomac River below and escaping into the woods."

Black Swan,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Nina is a talented but unstable ballerina on the verge of stardom. Pushed to the breaking point by her artistic director and a seductive rival, Nina's grip on reality slips, plunging her into a waking nightmare. Nina (Portman) is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica (Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.—Fox Searchlight Pictures Thomas Leroy, the artistic director of a New York City ballet company, is mounting Swan Lake as the company's next production. Many of the ballerinas in the company aspire for the lead, which would have previously gone to the company's former principle dancer Beth Macintyre before her forced retirement. No one wants the the role more than Nina Sayers, who lives to dance, so much so that she wants to be exactly like Beth in every aspect. Nina lives with her overbearing mother, Erica Sayers, a former ballerina who now lives vicariously through her daughter as she never made it as a ballerina herself. Nina is a technically proficient and hard working dancer who can easily capture the essence of the innocent white swan, but Thomas doesn't believe she has the dark passion required to portray the black swan. An unexpected move by Nina convinces Thomas that Nina may have what it takes, and he gives her the lead. Thomas will do anything to get that passion out of her. Nina feels that her new place in the company is threatened by Lily, a ballerina newly arrived into the company from San Francisco. Lily, who is looser in every aspect of her life than Nina, encompasses the essence of the black swan more so than Nina. But as Nina believes Lily is to her what she herself was to Beth, Nina, in doing whatever it takes to be perfect as both the white swan and the black swan, descends into madness.—Huggo Nina Sayers is a dancers with a New York City ballet company. She is dedicated to her art and her craft but lacks confidence. She is also pressed on by her domineering mother, also a ballerina in her youth, who gave up dancing when she got pregnant with Nina. Nina seems to achieve her goal when the company's artistic director Thomas Leroy selects her as the lead in their new production of Swan Lake. Leroy is honest however in telling her that while he has no doubt she can handle the role of the white swan, he's not sure she can handle the role of the black swan. Adding to her self-doubts is the arrival of a new dancer, Lily, who seems ideally suited to playing the black swan. To succeed, Nina will will have to transform herself into something she has never been.—garykmcd With the overwhelming desire for perfection gnawing at her, devoted New York City ballerina Nina Sayers is about to see her efforts bear fruit. Suddenly, as autocratic artistic director Thomas Leroy forces his former protégé into early retirement, Nina gets the chance to shine in a bold re-imagining ofPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's undying love story, The Swan Lake. However, this is a demanding dual role defined by two contrasting characters: the White and the Black Swan. And then, as if relentless competition weren't enough, fiercely ambitious corps-de-ballet dancer Lily enters the picture. As a result, unbounded jealousy and grotesque hallucinations get the best of the fragile prima ballerina. But Nina's dormant dark side screams for recognition. Because, more than anything, the passionate Black Swan demands transcendence. The question is, what is the price of excellence?—Nick Riganas The movie opens as Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a young ballerina in her mid twenties, is dancing the prologue to Swan Lake. Swan Lake is a ballet in which a princess is turned into the White Swan and can only be turned back if a man swears eternal fidelity to her. In the ballet, she is betrayed by the Black Swan, the evil magician's daughter whom the magician has transformed to look exactly like the princess in order to trick the prince who has fallen in love with her. In the end, the princess commits suicide because the Prince's infidelity has doomed her to remain a swan forever. As Nina dances in the role of the Princess, the magician appears and places the curse on the Princess. Nina then wakes up in her apartment, the dance sequence having been a dream. She begins her daily ballet stretching; telling her mother about her dream as her mother unintentionally ignores her. Nina mentions that the director, Thomas Leroy (pronounced Tomahs; the name is French), of her ballet company has promised to feature her more this season and her mother agrees that she's been there long enough.Nina goes to the ballet studio only to learn that Beth (Winona Ryder), the lead principal dancer, is being put out to pasture due to her age as she is over 40. As a result, Thomas (Vincent Cassel) is looking for a new face to be the lead. Thomas announces to the company that the first performance of the season will be a reworking of Swan Lake. He casually walks among the dancers as they're practising nonchalantly, tapping several girls on the shoulder as he talks. He then tells those he tapped to attend their regular rehearsals; those he didn't tap are to meet with him later in the principal studio.Nina sees Beth having an emotional meltdown in her private dressing room, throwing things and breaking the full length mirror. After Beth leaves, Nina decides to take a peek inside. She sits down in Beth's chair and stares at herself in a mirror surrounded by globe lights. She begins to go through Beth's things and stashes several items in her pocket, specifically perfume, diamond earrings, a nail file and tube of lipstick. She sneaks out of Beth's dressing room.Later, in the principal studio, auditions are being held to find Beth's replacement as the Swan Princess. Nina dances the White Swan impeccably, and then Thomas tells Nina to dance as the Black Swan. As Nina begins the dance her audition is interrupted by the late arrival of new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis). Already fearing imperfection and disappointing Thomas, she loses focus as Lily noisily closes the door and stops. Despite her flawless performance as the White Swan, Thomas is not impressed by Nina's performance, stating she failed to capture the sensuality of the Black Swan. Nina goes home to her mother and bursts into tears and practices her dance moves until she cracks her big toe nail. Later, when her mother tucks her in, Nina tells her she can go to Thomas the next day and tell him she finished the Black Swan dance, but her mother tells her there is no need to lie and Nina nods in defeated agreement.The next day, Nina visits Thomas in his office and tells him she finished the Black Swan dance at home and wants the role. He tells her that he's decided to give it to another dancer, Veronica (Ksenia Soto). She says 'okay' and begins to leave but he slams the door and asks her why she's giving up. He grabs her face and kisses her passionately. Angered by this unwanted advance, Nina bites him on the lip and runs out of his office which both shocks and impresses Thomas.The girls begin running down the hall to find out who has been chosen as the new Swan Queen. Feeling certain she didn't get the role, Nina congratulates Veronica for getting it. The girl runs to see the posting but walks back to Nina and berates her for the cruel joke before walking off down the hall. Stunned and confused, Nina goes to look at the posting. As she approaches, several girls gather around her shouting congratulations at her. Overjoyed, and nauseous, she runs to the bathroom where she calls her mother from one of the stalls and tells her that she won the part. When she leaves the stall she sees the word ""whore"" written on the mirror in red lipstick and frantically struggles to wipe it off. When Nina gets home, her mother has ordered her a beautiful pink and white frosted cake -- strawberries and cream, their favorite from the local bakery -- that she presents to Nina when she walks in the door to celebrate Nina acquiring the role in the ballet. Her mother starts to cut her a slice but Nina refuses, telling her she can't eat something like that and when her mother gives her a look, Nina continues, saying that her stomach is still in knots. Becoming angry, her mother begins to throw the cake out which leaves Nina feeling guilty. She accepts a slice and takes a small bite.Over the next several days, the stress of the role and her inability to perform get to Nina. She begins seeing a darker version of herself in random passers-by.Thomas holds a gala to officially announce Beth's ""retirement"" and Nina's rise as the Swan Queen. Nina goes to the bathroom and on her way out encounters Lily coming in. In front of Nina, Lily takes off her panties and puts them in her purse, then sits down on vanity. She congratulates Nina on her role, but Nina is uncomfortable and attempts to excuse herself. Lily playfully asks her to stay, but Nina leaves.As Nina and Thomas leave the party, Thomas is briefly called back inside. Intoxicated, with her eyes dripping with black mascara from crying, Beth confronts Nina and asks her if she had to suck Thomas' cock to get the role. Nina is offended, and tells Beth that not everyone has to. Beth continues to rant until Thomas appears and diffuses the situation, soothing Beth by calling her ""My little princess."" Beth shouts after them as Thomas leads Nina out. He takes Nina back to his place. When they sit on the couch, he brusquely asks her if she she's a virgin. She looks away and smiles uncomfortably. He asks if she likes making love and when she won't answer, he gives her a homework assignment: she must touch herself and find her sexuality so that she may better inhabit the role.Later, when Nina's mother is helping her dress for bed she sees scratches on Nina's back, and asks what they are from. Nina says they're nothing but a rash and her mother becomes angry and hints that Nina hasn't scratched herself like this since she was younger, and she thought Nina was over this. Nina tries to brush her off but her mother grabs her hand and takes her to the bathroom to cut her fingernails with scissors. She accidentally cuts Nina's finger and apologizes profusely but continues to trim Nina's nails.Nina wakes up the next morning and begins touching herself as Thomas asked. When she becomes aroused, she goes faster and turns over. As she gets closer, she turns her head to the left and is startled to realize her mother is asleep in the chair next to her bed.The next day the company is practising and a girl runs in, crying hysterically. She runs to the teacher who comforts her and asks what happened. She says Beth is in the hospital after an accident when she got hit by a passing car. Later, Nina is sitting at the edge of a fountain with Thomas and he tells her he believes that Beth threw herself into oncoming traffic. She visits Beth in the hospital where she finds her room filled with beautiful flowers and cards wishing her a quick recovery. As Beth lays comatose in the bed, Nina lifts up the sheet draped over Beth and sees metal bars sticking out of her leg and a huge, infected gash on her calf. Horrified, she quickly turns to leave and bumps into Beth's nurse (Leslie Lyles) who asks what she is doing there.She goes to practice and still cannot get the passion of the Black Swan into her performance. Suddenly the lights go out and Thomas calls for someone to turn them back on, that there are still people rehearsing. The lights come back on, but a clearly disappointed Thomas sends the other dancers home and steps in to dance as Nina's partner. As they dance together, he slowly moves his hands under her thighs and begins touching her. After a deep kiss, he lets go of her and walks away, calling over his shoulder that he just seduced her and that it should be her doing the seducing with her dancing. Nina calls after, pleading, but he does not turn back.Nina, feeling defeated in her attempt to be perfect, sits alone and cries in the studio. Lily arrives, sees Nina crying, and lights a cigarette as she walks up. Lily chats casually, implying that Thomas has a tendency of sleeping with the troupe and Nina tries to defend him. Lily realizes that Nina has a crush on Thomas and jokes about it. Infuriated by such a thought, Nina gets upset and leaves.The next day, Thomas angrily asks Nina if she needs time off after a comment from Lily that he should take it easy on her. He says she has no business whining and she fervently defends herself saying she didn't. Angered, Nina tracks Lily down in the troupe dressing room where she is greeted with banter from the other dancers who say that ""the queen"" is gracing them with her presence on their turf. Lily tells them to shut up and gets up to talk to Nina. Nina berates Lily for telling Thomas that she'd been crying. Lily looks abashed and says she was just trying to help. Nina tells her she doesn't need the help and Lily walks away irritated.That night, Nina and her mother are working on Nina's toe shoes. Erica (Nina's mother) is making small talk that sounds condescending to Nina so she starts answering with slight hostility without looking up at Erica. Her mother asks Nina if she's been scratching and Nina unintentionally pauses just long enough for Erica to not believe Nina when she says ""no"". Erica tells her to take off her shirt and Nina refuses so Erica stands over Nina and demands it but Nina says no in a biting tone. Before Erica can get her confirmation there is a knock at the door. She answers the door and talks quickly to someone before closing it again. Nina asks who it was but Erica says it was no one, so Nina demands to know again and when Erica still won't tell her she runs to the door and opens it. She sees Lily waiting for the elevator. Nina walks out into the hallway and asks Lily how she knew where she lived and Lily responds with sarcasm. But Nina looks angry so Lily laughingly says she asked Thomas' secretary. Erica opens the door and says Nina needs to come in and rest. Nina tells her to shut the door, which Erica slams. Lily invites her out and Nina says she can't, but after Erica opens the door and tells her once more and tells Nina to come back inside and also asks Lily to leave, Nina pushes the door open to grab her stuff and leaves with Lily, despite her mother's protests shouted down the hall that it's the night before a long day of work and she should stay home.Nina and Lily go out to a local bar for drinks and some food, but Nina is so uptight that Lily offers her a pill to relax, saying it would only last a few hours. Nina turns it down. She goes to the bathroom and returns to see Lily slip the content of the pill into a drink, as she flirts with two guys she is calling Tom (Toby Hemingway) and ""Jerry"" though he tells her his real name is Andrew. Nina is reassured by Lily that the pills will only last a few hours and downs her glass. The two have a crazy, drugged night of clubbing with two guys. When Nina is next lucid, she finds herself hooking up with a man in a bathroom. She quickly leaves to find a cab and Lily runs to catch up with her. They take the taxi back to Nina's apartment and Lily comes onto Nina and begins gently rubbing Nina's crotch until Nina stops her and just holds Lily's hand.When they get back to the apartment, Nina's mother is waiting for them and asks Nina what she was doing out late. Nina is drunk and somewhat belligerent but finally says, ""I was with two guys named Tom and Jerry and I fucked them both,"" and laughs. Nina's mother is horrified and slaps her across the face. Nina grabs Lily and runs into her room, barricading the door with a wood cleat, yelling at her mother to leave her alone. She turns around and looks at Lily, then walks to her and starts passionately kissing her. They move to the bed where Lily and Nina undress each other to their underwear where Lily then rips Nina's panties off. Lily begins to orally pleasure Nina and she briefly sees Lily morph into herself and then back to Lily, which scares her. Lily doesn't stop and the two continue to have sex, with Lily performing cunnilingus on Nina who eventually climaxes. Lily says, ""Sweet girl"" before morphing back into dark Nina, who raises a pillow to smother her.Nina wakes up the next morning with a hangover-like headache to find Lily gone and realizes she is late for rehearsal. As her mother sits quietly in the living room, Nina yells at her and asks why she didn't wake her up. Erica says this role is destroying her and as Nina rushes out the door, she tells Erica that she is moving out.When Nina arrives at the ballet studio, she finds Lily in her costume, practicing her routine with the rest of the troupe. When Lily walks up to Nina, she says she was only filling in because Thomas had asked her to. Nina then questions Lily about why she left her house the night before, and Lily claims she went home to her place with Tom where they spent the night, and that last time she saw Nina was at the club. When Nina brings up what happened in her bedroom, Lily is flattered that Nina had a lesbian wet dream about her. She playfully asks Nina if she was any good but Nina gets embarrassed and leaves, looking uncomfortable and frustrated, wondering if her lovemaking with Lily had really happened or not.A little later, Nina is being fitted for her Swan costume. When she's done, Lily walks in and says Thomas made Lily Nina's alternate. Enraged and afraid, Nina finds Thomas and begs him not to make Lily her alternate, convinced that Lily is trying to steal the role from her. As Nina begins to cry, Thomas soothes her before telling her she is being paranoid. He tells her that the only person trying to sabotage Nina is ""Nina"".That night, Nina is practising when the piano player suddenly stops playing and gets up to leave, telling Nina he has a life. He tells her not to practice too long and leaves her alone in the studio. As she begins dancing again the lights shut off just as they had when shed been practising with Thomas. She calls out for someone to turn the lights back on, and sees a cloaked figure darting around in the shadows (the Sorcerer from the dream). She hears laughter and follows the noise to find Thomas having sex with Lily (which morphs into Nina) on a work table behind a curtain. Lily smiles at Thomas and laughs. This brings tears to Nina's eyes and she runs back to her dressing room where she grabs the items she took from Beth when the room was still hers.In a fit of hysteria, Nina goes to the hospital to find Beth sitting motionless in a wheelchair, now a mere shadow of the woman she used to be. Nina quietly places a note and the items she stole on the table next to Beth, when Beth suddenly stirs and grabs Nina's arm. Beth is angry and asks what Nina is doing, then she looks down and sees the items on the table. She asks Nina in an amused but irritated voice why she stole from her. Nina says she just wanted to be perfect like Beth. As Beth looks at the items, she says she's nothing and then notices the nail file. She continues to say she's nothing as she suddenly stabs herself in the face with the file repeatedly. Nina finally grabs the nail file from Beth's hand and runs fearfully from the room to the elevator. As she gets in the elevator, she drops the bloody nail file.Nina returns home, dashing hysterically into the kitchen to wash her hands which are covered in Beth's blood. When she turns the kitchen light off, she hears someone whisper ""sweet girl"", at which she turns the light back on to see Beth standing there with her face covered in blood. She runs to the bathroom and vomits into the toilet. She then calls down the hall for her mother, walking toward her mother's art studio, hearing voices coming from the studio. As she peers in, she imagines her mother's paintings moving and talking to her. She runs in and starts tearing everything down, and imagines Beth coming towards her with a bloody face, until her mother walks in and, astonished, asks Nina what she's doing. Nina runs past her mother to her bedroom, with Erica close behind. As she tries to reach Nina, Nina slams the door on her hand, breaking it. Nina barricades herself inside with the pipe again. As Nina stands there, her skin begins to shift and take on a bird like texture, her eyes start to turn red, and her knee joints violently invert to the same shape as a bird. The hallucination disorients Nina and she falls and hits her head on a bed post which knocks her out.Nina wakes up the next day as in a normal day, but with socks rubber-banded on her hands and a headache. She looks to her mother, who is sitting next to the bed with a bandage on her hand. Nina asks her mother why her hands are covered and Erica says it is to prevent scratching, that she'd been doing it all night. Nina suddenly realizes it must be late and says she needs to get to the ballet company because its opening day. Her mother says she called and let them know Nina wasn't feeling well and wouldn't be able to perform that night. Nina is furious and gets out of bed. She goes for the door but her mother has locked the door and removed the door knob. Nina turns around and yells at her mother to let her out. Erica tells her she isn't well and the role has taken her over. Nina grabs her mother's broken hand and pulls her out of the chair. As her mother cries and holds her injured hand, Nina takes the door knob out from under the cushion and walks toward the door. Her mother reaches out for her and asks what happened to her sweet girl, and Nina says in a harsh, evil tone, ""she's gone"", and walks out of the room.Nina arrives at the ballet and ignores whispers from the troupe as she passes them (with the camera following her from behind). She finds Lily in costume talking to Thomas in the hall, prepared to take the stage as the lead. Nina confidently tells Thomas that she is ready to perform and goes to sit down in her dressing room, with Lily asking what's going on behind her. Thomas follows her into the room and says that he's already told Lily she'll be performing. Nina says if she doesn't take the stage then the company will be marred with controversy, after Beth's incident. Thomas looks slightly amused and impressed at her audacity and tells her to get ready.Nina goes on and is just as timid and rigid in her performance as she was during rehearsals. While in the wings she sees Lily flirting with one of the male dancers and also becomes distracted by Lily while they're dancing on stage; subsequently, during a lift, she loses concentration which causes the lead male to drop her. She recovers herself but during an interval, Thomas is enraged and asks what the hell that was all about. Nina blames it on her dance partner but Thomas walks away from her. When she enters her dressing room, Lily is sitting at her dressing table putting on make-up. Nina yells at her to get out of her room. Lily taunts Nina, saying perhaps she should dance the Black Swan's dance as Nina is not fit to dance it, and they begin to fight. Lily morphs into Nina off and on as Nina struggles against her. Nina pushes Lily into the same full-length mirror Beth destroyed and it shatters. As the fight escalates further, Nina grabs a piece of the mirror and stabs Lily in the stomach. Unsure of what to do, Nina hides the bleeding body in her bathroom and then puts on the Black Swan's make-up. She takes the stage and begins to dance with passionate abandon. As she dances with everything Thomas has been asking for, she begins to physically transform into a large Black Swan on stage, growing feathers and wings. She dances the part better than ever and the crowd gives her a standing ovation as the piece ends.Nina runs off stage toward Thomas and, in front of everyone, kisses him passionately after finally seducing him with her movements. He smiles and tells her to go back out for a second bow. After leaving the stage again, Nina goes into her dressing room to change for the next act and realizes the blood is starting to pour out from under the bathroom door. Nina places a towel over the growing pool of blood and then hears a knock at the door. When she opens the door... Lily is standing there. She apologizes for how things turned out between them and congratulates Nina on her amazing performance as the Black Swan. Nina is shocked and bewildered as Lily smiles and walks away. Nina turns around and removes the towel to find there is no blood. She turns to look at the broken mirror pieces from the smashed mirror still on the floor then suddenly moves her hand to her abdomen. She's bleeding, and she reaches into the wound and pulls out a broken shard of glass. (In her unhinged and delusional mind, Nina had stabbed herself before the Black Swan dance, imagining it was Lily). Despite her wound, she dresses for her final act as the White Swan. Nina dances the second act beautifully, which entrances the audience so that they don't see the small stain of blood growing in the mid-section of her white costume.In the final scene of the last act, the White Swan goes to the top of a large structure to commit suicide. Nina does this with grace, looks down at the suitors below, and then turns and falls in slow motion onto the mattress below as her mother sits in the audience, smiling and crying. When the curtain falls, Thomas is overjoyed and newly infatuated with Nina. He is smiling in adoration as he kneels to congratulate her, a crowd of ballerinas gathering around the star. Nina doesn't speak, but instead just smiles and listens to the praise. Lily suddenly gasps - the first to notice the immense blood stain forming on Nina's costume. Someone calls for help, and Thomas frantically asks her, ""What did you do?!"" Nina calmly and quietly utters, ""I was perfect"". The crowd continues to roar with applause as the screen slowly fades to white..."

The departing priest tells Tuck that the Loxley family is always causing troubles for the church.Robin and his men arrive at the ships and present themselves as knights. The guardians of the ship tell Robin that they were expecting 12 knights and the king but Robin informs them that Richard is dead and presents them with his crown. They bring the men aboard and set sail for England. The men drink and sing but Robin examines the sword of Loxley. He unwinds pieces of metal and sees that the inscribed motto reads ""Until Lambs Become Lions."" Little John asks the plan and Robin explains that they will go north from London after delivering the crown.The next morning Robin wakes up and sees they are 40 minutes away from England. His men are scared that their masquerade will be undone by the members of the royal court. Robin tells his men that they should be ready to run for their lives if they are recognized as impostors. The royal court expects to see the king disembark. However, King Richard's mother Eleanor suspects something is wrong when Robin comes ashore instead of Richard. Robin gives the crown to Eleanor.Sir Godfrey watches from afar as Robin delivers the crown. For a moment they are concerned that Loxley lied about the king's death. Prince John is shocked that his brother is dead. His mother places the crown on John's head, as he is now king of England. Robin presents himself as Loxley of Nottingham and John asks how his brother died. John offers Robin a reward. He asks if Robin said he was from Nottingham. Robin hesitantly says yes and John says that Sir Walter Loxley (Robert's father) owes taxes to the crown. John offers Robin his ring but then takes it back, saying that is his first payment. King John greets Sir Godfrey and invites him to dine with him later.William Marshall (William Hurt), a man in the crowd, tells Robin that he will visit Sir Walter soon. Robin says that he will deliver the message. Godfrey knows that Robin is impersonating Loxley and tells his men that since he knows too much, he must be killed. Robin rides out of the city with his men toward Nottingham.Lady Marion and her servants are plowing a field when the sheriff arrives and tells her that he expects an audience with Sir Walter. Lady Marion asks why he isn't taking care of the robbers in Sherwood instead. The sheriff says Sir Walter needs to pay his taxes and the sheriff will come and break down the door to collect the money. He makes an advance on Marion, who threatens that her husband will kill him, but the sheriff laughs at her. He tells her that her husband is surely dead after ten years and leaves her alone in the field.The men eat and sing together in the forest until Robin abruptly suggests that they part ways after dividing the spoils. Little John asks where Robin will go. Robin tells them that he has to honor the dying wish of Loxley. His men call him crazy but Robin tells them that he owes it to Lady Fortune.King John and William Marshall discuss the financial cost of the army of England. King John wants to disband but Marshall points out that it would be more efficient just to keep it together. The war has ravaged the economy and the people are feeling the strain.Marshall tells him that he should take out loans from Normandy but John just wants to tax the people. Godfrey presents himself and offers to collect the money or kill those who refuse. Marshall is taken aback by this but Godfrey tells him it's what must be done. King John thinks this is well said.Eleanor, the queen mother, tells John that Richard would have done things differently. John loses his temper with her and blames her for the wreckage of England. She slaps him and leaves the room. King John forces Marshall to resign and dismisses him from court. Godfrey follows him out and Marshall tells him to choose the spot where he places his dagger carefully. Godfrey mocks him by showing him the seal that grants him Marshall's position and leaves.Robin and his men arrive in Nottingham. They are unimpressed by the setting. Friar Tuck, who takes care of the bees, addresses them. He tells Robin where to find the house of Loxley, and Robin rides off. The others ask where they can find liquor but Little John apologizes. Friar Tuck exhorts them and offers them some honey liquor (mead).Robin arrives at the Loxley house. He sees Lady Marion milking a cow and addresses her rudely as ""girl"" while checking her out. He introduces himself as Robin Longstride and asks to see Sir Walter. He tells her that Robert is dead and she leads him inside. She says that she is Robert's wife. He tells her how Robert died. She advises him to lie to Sir Walter about Robert's death. Sir Walter (Max von Sydow) is blind but Robin gives him his sword back. Walter knows his son is dead when he feels the sword; he asks what happened. Robin tells him that Robert's final words were of his love for his father. Walter guides his hands over Robin's face. He asks Robin to dinner and tells him that he needs to bathe first.Lady Marion offers him her husband's clothes. He asks for help taking off the armor he is wearing. She is uneasy about this but complies with his request.Walter asks Robin about his journey. Robin tells Walter his life story: He was abandoned as a child and doesn't know his origins, only where he's been. Walter makes an offer: if Robin gives him some time, the sword of Loxley will be his. Walter says that he can tell him something of his history. He goes on to request that Robin stay and pretend to be Robert so that Marion can keep her land. Walter says that Robin must become his son. Robin agrees, despite Lady Marion's rage.The House of Loxley celebrates the ""return"" of Robin. Robin's men are impressed by the women. Friar Tuck asks why they call him ""Little"" John and John replies by telling him that he's got a proportionate penis before pursuing some of the women at the party.Lady Marion and Robin must share a bedroom to maintain the ruse. She asks if he is coming to bed, but he tells her to ask nicely. She sarcastically requests that he return to their room. Robin reflects on the sword's motto by the fire before retiring to the room. They share the room but Lady Marion tells him that if he touches her in her bed, she will stab him. Robin lies by the fire with a lamb and goes to sleep.Godfrey meets with his French counterparts in a dark field. They are ready to launch their attack on England and on King John. Marshall receives a note meant for Godfrey which warns that 200 French soldiers have landed in Britain.Sir Walter greets Robin in the morning. He calls Lady Marion and tells her to show Robin around Nottingham in order to familiarize him with the village and its people. Lady Marion shows him around the fields despite her misgivings. He asks where the cows and sheep are. She replies they are gone, and that all they eat are rabbits and pigs. She mentions that the deer are off limits since they all belong to the king. She tells him to act like Sir Robert. Villagers greet him and he pretends to know them. Lady Marion is introduced to Robin's companions in arms. He tells them to pretend he is Loxley and they agree, but mock him as well.Friar Tuck meets with Robin and Marion. Marion tells Tuck that they are stealing grain that the people of Nottingham had raised under the guise of tax. Robin asks if the church knows that Tuck is raising bees that produce honey. Tuck responds by asking, what if the grain doesn't reach York? Robin tells him that the church won't need to know of the bees.That night, Robin pays a visit to Friar Tuck. They drink mead together and Robin tells Tuck that they need to steal the grain for Nottingham. Pretending to be the Sherwood robbers, they steal the grain. They take the grain and plant it in the fields during the night as it starts to rain. Lady Marion is impressed by Robin's actions and sees him sleeping near the fields. She asks how he found the seed, but he doesn't tell her.Godfrey leads his men in the name of the king to the towns which refuse to pay their taxes. Godfrey and his men slaughter the townspeople in retaliation. He takes the gold by force and leaves entire towns aflame.Marshall visits Queen Eleanor and tells her he has lost faith in John. He tells her that Godfrey is pissing off the Northern barons to provoke them to attack the throne so that England will be in chaos when the French invade. Eleanor tells John's new wife, Isabella, that a paid agent of France is planning an attack. She tells Isabella that if she wants to earn the title of queen she must tell John that Godfrey is plotting against him. John flips out when he hears this. Isabella tells him that it's true and that if he doesn't believe her he should kill her. He kisses her and begs her forgiveness.A messenger demands an audience with the sheriff of Nottingham and delivers a letter telling him that Godfrey is coming to Nottingham. He tells the messenger that Loxley will be trouble.Lady Marion describes her married life. The daughter of a widow, she was married a week before Robert left for war. Robin tells her that Robert was a good knight. He helps her mount her horse and they ride off.King John visits Marshall and asks why he deserted him when Godfrey is planning to help the French attach him. Marshall tells him that they need to reach out to the Barons of the North and that King John must meet them. King John tells him that they will be taking the militia to meet with the barons in battle. Marshall requests a horse from his servants so that he might find the Northern Barons.The messenger returns to Godfrey and tells him that he found Robin. Godfrey tells him that when they arrive in Nottingham they will take no prisoners and will make the place famous from how much blood will be shed.At a village dance, Robin dances with Lady Marion in front of everyone. Afterward, Walter tells Robin that his father was a visionary and a philosopher. ""Until Lambs Become Lions"" was his motto and he was able to galvanize the people with his words. Walter tells Robin that when Robin was younger he witnessed his father's execution. Robin bursts into tears when he realizes the truth. His father had written a charter of rights and Walter shows it to Robin. A messenger arrives from Marshall requesting Sir Walter's assistance in preparing the troops.Robin rides out to Marshall, who is telling the barons of the North that Godfrey is attempting to cause chaos so that England can be conquered by France. King John arrives and takes the stand. King John claims that Godfrey was acting only to cause chaos and his men point out that he did so easily. Meanwhile, Robin arrives at a burnt down town and sees the ground where his father was killed years before. He strikes a stone on a statue and removes it to find a hand print he left as a child. He walks over to Marshall as King John speaks. He announces his arrival and tells his people that their tyranny is the heart of failure. He asserts that every man deserves power and that King John's demands will be his undoing. Robin incites the crowd with his words and tells King John that liberty by law is the right of all men. They gather and prepare for war.Godfrey leads his men to Nottingham and prepares to slaughter the townsfolk. The men march to Sir Walter's house looking to kill Robin. Walter walks out, blind and carrying his sword. Godfrey tells Walter that he killed Robert. Godfrey toys with Walter but Walter succeeds in cutting Godfrey's face before he is run through and killed. Godfrey's men collect the money of the town. The Sherwood robbers see what is going on in Nottingham. Friar Tuck manages to trap a few soldiers in the bee house and leaves them to die. The messenger attempts to rape Lady Marion. She goads him before stabbing him in the neck and killing him.The Sherwood robbers help Marion escape as Robin arrives and leads the attack on Godfrey's men. Godfrey retreats with what men survive to meet up with the French in the south. Walter's servants bring the sword of Loxley to Marion, telling her that he is dead. She gives him the sword and Robin hugs her. They burn Walter's body on a funeral pyre. Robin tells Marion he will come back. They share a kiss and he tells her that he loves her.The French begin their invasion of England as Robin and his men ride for the coast preparing for battle. King John asks Robin and Marshall what they need to do to beat the French. Robin leads the archers to the cliff tops as Marshall leads the ground troops. They charge the French in battle. Little John brutalizes the French troops along side Robin's other men. King John charges into the fray for personal glory. Lady Marion, dressed as a man, attempts to kill Godfrey but he drags her into the water and attempts to drown her. Robin charges Godfrey and tackles him. The two duel on the shore in front of the French boats. Marion forces herself up while Robin is caught between two French boats. Godfrey flees. Robin escapes from the boats and picks up an arrow. He sees Godfrey in the distance and shoots him through the neck. Robin then pulls the unconscious Marion out of the water and kisses her. The English troops push the French back and King Philip orders a retreat. The English are victorious. King John sees Robin carrying Lady Marion away.King John perceives the French as surrendering to Robin. Seeing him as a threat, he declares Robin an enemy of the crown and an outlaw. He refuses to sign the Magna Carta presented by the people. He silences his people and burns the document.The sheriff of Nottingham reads a declaration that anyone who helps Robin will be killed. In lieu of a nail, Robin shoots the order into a wall as an act of rebellion. Marion, Robin, and his men retreat to Sherwood Forest."
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0980970/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Lucy and Edmund Pevensie return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace where they meet up with Prince Caspian for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader. Along the way they encounter dragons, dwarves, merfolk, and a band of lost warriors before reaching the edge of the world. Lucy and Edmund Pevensie are stranded in Cambridge, living in the house of their obnoxious cousin Eustace, while the grown-ups Susan and Peter are living in the USA with their parents. When a painting of a ship sailing on the sea of Narnia overflows water in their room, Lucy, Edmund and Eustace are transported to the ocean of Narnia and rescued by King Caspian and the crew of the ship The Dawn Treader. Caspian explains that Narnia has been in peace for three years but before he took his throne back, his uncle tried to kill the seven lords of Telmar, who were the closest and most loyal friends of his father. They fled to The Lone Island and no one has ever heard anything about them. Now Caspian is seeking out the lords of Telmar with his Captain Drinian, the talking mouse Reepicheep and his loyal men. Soon, they discover that an evil form of green mist is threatening Narnia and the siblings and their cousin join Caspian in a quest to retrieve the seven swords of the seven lords of Telmar to save Narnia from evil.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Along with a cousin, two of the four siblings return to Narnia to fight a new kind of threat. Reuniting with friends, they must seek a way to defeat the threat that can destroy Narnia. Along the way, they all learn multiple things about life and survival.—RECB3 Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes), almost but not quite an adult, envies adult men. He tries to enlist in His Majesty's Army, but the recruiter, of course, catches him out with his fake I.D., especially when his sister Lucy (Georgie Henley) reminds him that he was supposed to help her with grocery shopping.Lucy envies any girl whom she thinks is prettier than she. The problem is that her only standards of beauty are her older sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), now in America, and any other girl who is hanging on the arm of a young man.Edmund and Lucy have another problem. Because the war still rages, they are evacuated once again. Only while Peter (William Moseley) and Susan are evaculated all the way to America, Edmund and Lucy are evacuated, not to Professor Digory Kirke's country estate (see The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe), but to the home of their obnoxious cousin, Eustace Clarence Scrubb (Will Poulter). Eustace has no social graces whatsoever and would like nothing better than to treat Edmund and Lucy as he would treat any of the arthropods in his considerable, and repulsive, collection.One afternoon, Lucy and Edmund are alone in the room that Edmund has to share with Eustace. They notice a painting on a wall--a painting of a ship on an ocean, a ship that looks very much like one of the ships they once sailed in the world of Narnia, where once they had reigned as a king and a queen. Only as they stare at the painting, the water seems to move, and the ship seems to come right at them. Eustace enters, and makes fun of them for indulging, as he sees it, in a flight of fancy. But then the seawater starts to *spill into the room.* Eustace, panicked, tears the painting off the wall, but that does no good. In the next instant, the room is full of water, rising until they are swimming in it. Soon they are underwater, and rising up to the surface of a real ocean. And there comes the ship, big as life!The crew of that ship pick them up at once. Edmund and Lucy discover, to their delight, that the ship is actually Narnian. The distinguished passenger on board is none other than King Caspian (Ben Barnes), with whom they had fought a successful war three years before (in Narnian time; see Prince Caspian). Eustace is thoroughly affronted, especially with a Talking Mouse (Simon Pegg) who protests that he was only trying to resuscitate him! To make matters worse, a walking, talking Minotaur (Shane Rangi) tells him that he is aboard the Dawn Treader, ""the finest ship in the Narnian Navy!""Caspian welcomes Edmund and Lucy on board as honored guests. Then, after outfitting them both in Narnian clothing, he gives Lucy her dagger and medicinal cordial (and Susan's bow and arrows), and offers Edmund his old electric torch, which he had left behind.Now Caspian reveals his mission. He is looking for the Seven Lost Lords of Narnia, friends of his father's whom Lord Protector Miraz had driven into exile. They had fled to the Lone Islands, and no one has heard from them since. Caspian's mission: to rescue or recover them.Reepicheep the Talking Mouse has a mission of his own: he wants to travel to the literal end of the world, and find the country of Aslan (Liam Neeson), the lion-shaped God-King of the world of Narnia.Lucy thoroughly enjoys the sights and sounds of Narnia. Edmund and Caspian entertain the crew with a fencing match. Eustace stubbornly insists that he ""never lost"" his ""sea legs."" Eustace boasts that he will find the British Consulate, as if Britain even *has* a consulate in this world. But all this idle talk stops, as the Dawn Treader comes within sight of land: Narrowhaven, capital city on the largest of the Lone Islands, their immediate destination.Tavros the Minotaur, who obviously serves as boatswain on board, orders two longboats fitted out. In them, Caspian leads a landing party ashore. Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep are all part of it. They find Narrowhaven deserted, and Caspian and the children go further inland to investigate. Inside an empty hall, they find ledgers showing purchases and sales--of slaves. Just then, the slavers rappel down ropes and attack. Lucy, Edmund, and Caspian handily fight off the attackers, but Eustace is easily seized, and used as leverage to capture all four of them. In the dungeon into which the slavers throw them, they find Lord Bern (Terry Norris), first of the Seven Lords, who has been a prisoner for many years. Bern recognizes Caspian as his king and tells him what has befallen Narrowhaven. Then they watch as the slavers take a cartload of very frightened slaves, load them into a longboat, and shove it out to sea--where an animated green mist suddenly appears, washes over them, and then disappears--with the slaves. Lord Bern tells Caspian that his six companions set out to find the source of the mist, and never returned. Bern has reproached himself ever since for not going with them.The next day, the slavers try to sell the children at auction. An apparent buyer shows up--who is actually Lord Drinian (Gary Sweet), captain of Dawn Treader, and enough men-at-arms to take over the town and set all the slaves at liberty. Eustace tries to steal away in a longboat, but succeeds only in decking another slaver who tries to kill him before the other Narnians show up.A distraught man of Narrowhaven name Rhince (Arthur Angel), seeking to find his wife Helaine (Rachel Blakely), who was on the last longboat devoured by the mists, signs on with Dawn Treader's crew. Lord Bern then retrieves a sword he has kept all this time, one of seven swords that Aslan gave to the Seven Lords. Bern gives this to Caspian, who then gives it to Edmund to use while he is in Narnia.Dawn Treader sets sail to go further east. Eustace keeps a diary, always assuming that everything around him is an illusion. And then on his first full night on board, he tries to steal water and food from the ship's rations. Reepicheep catches him at it, and the two fight a quick duel, Reepicheep with his sword, and Eustace with the first weapon he finds handy: a galley knife. The fight is almost one-sided, except that Reepicheep is trying more to train Eustace in swordfighting than to do him any real harm. Then Eustace falls over a bundle--that turns out to be a little girl, Gael (Arabella Morton), Rhince and Helaine's daughter, who desperately wants to find her mother. Captain Drinian says nothing about the attempted ration theft, and simply welcomes the little girl as ""an extra crewmember."" Lucy takes to Gael quickly and acts as her protector.Dawn Treader next fetches up at another apparently uninhabited island. Only this island *is* inhabited, by invisible men who hop about on one foot each--but are quite capable of abducting someone. They abduct Lucy and bring her into the garden of a mansion several yards inland (a mansion that is also invisible, and by the same means: a magic spell). They want her to go into this mansion, find a book of spells, and recite a spell to render them visible once again. Lucy reluctantly does so, especially after the voices tell her that they can neither read nor write.Caspian finds Lucy missing and awakens Edmund and the other members of the landing party (except Eustace, who sleeps on).Inside the mansion, Lucy finds the spell book, which she cannot open until she breathes upon it. She finds all sorts of spells inside, including a spell to make snow (she tries it, with success), and a spell to make one beautiful. She tears that page out, and then an angry lion's voice roars at her, rustling the pages. Then she hears Aslan's voice calling her name, after she looks into a mirror and sees her sister Susan's face. Now Lucy returns to the business at hand: she finds the spell to make things visible and says it. Just in time, too, for the inhabitants have captured Caspian and the landing party. When they become visible again, they let their guard down and tell all.Lucy reappears, and introduces Coriakin (Bille Brown), the master of the island. Coriakin apologizes for rendering the monopods (""Dufflepuds"") invisible, saying that he had to protect them from ""The Evil"", i.e., the force behind the Green Mist. Now Coriakin has something to reveal: an animated, interactive chart of the eastern part of the Great Ocean. He tells Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, and Eustace that they must proceed to Aslan's Table, with a Blue Star to guide them, and lay upon it all of the Seven Swords of Aslan. But he also warns them: ""You are all about to be tested."" That applies equally to Caspian (who has always felt that he was not the king his father was) as it does to Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace.Dawn Treader then sets out again, this time sailing into a storm. Fourteen days effectively dampen everyone's spirits, except those of Reepicheep, who is hearty enough to accept anything as part of the adventure. Even Captain Drinian is reluctant, but Caspian insists on pressing on and reminds Drinian sharply that they have taken on a crewman and his daughter, who are very eager to find their loved one.During the storm, Lucy has the bad sense to try out the beauty spell. With the result that she becomes Susan, and finds herself with her brothers Peter (William Moseley) and Edmund in America. Problem: no such person as Lucy, and no Narnia, either. Now thoroughly frightened, Lucy awakes with a scream, to find herself face-to-face with Aslan. Aslan chides her for wishing herself away, and doubting her own value--for without Lucy, the Pevensies would never have found Narnia. Lucy, having learned her lesson, burns the beauty spell.The Green Mist briefly appears, and then moves out to the quarters that Edmund and Caspian share. Edmund wakes up to hear a voice he never wanted to hear again: that of his ancient temptress and cruel enemy, the White Witch of Narnia (Tilda Swinton). Then the Mist retreats when Lucy walks in on the boys to say that she could not sleep. Edmund knows why.The next day, the Dawn Treader puts ashore at yet another island. This one is uninhabited for real. Edmund, Lucy, and Caspian descend into a cave, where they find a pool of water with a golden statue at the bottom. Edmund tries to probe it with a broken-off branch--and the branch turns to gold in his hand. Then they realize that the statue is actually one of the Seven Lords, Restimar, now ""aurified"" and dead. They know that they must retrieve Restimar's sword--but Edmund is much taken with realizing that anything dipped into the pool turns to gold. He sees riches for himself, and Caspian sees a resource over which he, as king, should take dominion. Then the two start to argue, and only Lucy's intervention keeps the two from killing each other in a duel. And so they retrieve the sword and leave the pool alone.Eustace, meanwhile, goes off exploring on his own--and finds a rock defile filled with more treasure than he has ever seen in one place: gold, silver, and gemstones, all for the taking. He finds a skeleton (actually that of Lord Octesian) and puts on a gold bracelet that the skeleton had been wearing. That is a mistake.In the next scene, Caspian and Edmund set out to find Eustace, who they assume has strayed form camp. They find his clothing and diary, and fear the worst for him. They then recognize Octesian's remains and recover his sword. Then, out of nowhere, a winged, fire-breathing dragon swoops down from the mountains and alights on Dawn Treader's spar. Drinian leads his men-at-arms in a futile attempt to shoot the dragon off, and then Reepicheep climbs the mast and embeds his tiny sword into the dragon's talon. The dragon shrieks, jumps off, and flies back ashore--where he finds Edmund and Caspian, scoops up Edmund in his talons, and carries him inland, where Edmund reads this legend, burnt into the rocks: I AM EUSTACE.Edmund and Caspian realize the terrible truth: the dragon's treasure turned Eustace himself into a dragon. Lucy manages to relieve Eustace of Octesian's bracelet, which now hurts him terribly. Caspian observes that everyone in the world of Narnia knows that a dragon's treasure is enchanted, hence dangerous to collect or even to touch. Lucy, Edmund, Caspian, Gail, and Reepicheep agree to stay on the island overnight to keep Eustace company and decide how best to accommodate Eustace. Reepicheep actually warms to Eustace and tells him some of his favorite adventure stories. Eustace, unable to communicate, at least seems glad of the company. Reepicheep also suggests to Eustace that his transformation is a sign of an ""extraordinary destiny"" to come.In the next morning, the Blue Star appears to them. Dawn Treader embarks, with Eustace flying alongside. A mermaid tries to warn Lucy that they should sail no further; Lucy does not understand, and Caspian is determined to press on. Soon the ship is becalmed, and the men must fall to with their oars with grumblings from them of desiring to eat the dragon if the ship does not find land to resupply soon. However, Eustace wraps his tail around the ship's figurehead and takes it in tow. To that, the crew lets out a lusty cheer of approval upon realization that Eustace is now a valuable asset to the shipThat night, Dawn Treader lands at yet another island--Rhamandu's Island, where Aslan's Table is always spread. There the crew find three more of the Lords (Revilian, Argoz, and Mavramorn), not dead but fast asleep and tangled in their own beards. At Caspian's direction, they recover the swords that the Three Lords carried. They lay these, and the swords they brought with them, on the table--but they make only six. They still must recover one more.Then the Blue Star appears to them, and takes the form of a young woman--Liliandil (Laura Brent). She encourages them to eat freely of the fruit of Aslan's Table, and assures them that the three Lords are under a sleeping spell only for their own good, to stop them from killing one another, as they almost did. Liliandil then tells them that they must sail on to one more island: the Dark Island, source of the Green Mist and of every man's nightmare. There Lord Rhoop (Bruce Spence), carrying the last sword, walks that island, mad with fear. This will be their greatest hazard, for the island will make any man's nightmare take real form.Still they sail on to the island, with all hands armed. (Caspian gives his sword, that once belonged to Peter, to Edmund; Edmund gave up his sword at Aslan's Table.) Reepicheep struggles to give Eustace a pep talk, to remind him that, as a dragon, he has much better natural armor and weapons than any other hand aboard, and so should not flinch from battle.As Dawn Treader approaches the Dark Island, the Green Mist reaches out to it, though the men do their best to ignore it. Rhince sees a vision of his missing wife. Drinian sees a thick fog, that robs him of sight. Caspian sees a vision of his father, Caspian IX (Nathaniel Parker), dressing him down. Edmund sees the White Witch, who offers him the same thing that she once offered him many years before: to make him her king.Then they hear Lord Rhoop, shouting at them to keep off. Rhoop bears the Seventh Sword, as everyone thought he would. Rhoop is reluctant to come aboard, but Eustace simply flies to the island, scoops up Rhoop, and sets him on board. Rhoop acknowledges Caspian and warns Caspian that they must put out to sea at once and not think too much. But Edmund thinks of a Great Sea Serpent, which now takes form and attacks the ship.Eustace flies into battle and attacks the Serpent with all the fire he has--but the Serpent takes Eustace in his jaws, flings him this way and that, and throws him onto the rocks. Eustace recovers and blows more fire on the Serpent. Rhoop then foolishly throws his sword at the Serpent. He misses--and the sword embeds itself in Eustace' shoulder.Eustace flies off to Rhamadu's Island and makes a hard belly landing on the sand, as the Sea Serpent wraps itself around Dawn Treader, threatening to crush her. Edmund and Caspian seek to steer Dawn Treader toward the rocks, to ram the Serpent. Edmund challenges the Serpent, using Peter's old sword, while Caspian struggles with the wheel. Caspian's strategy is successful: they manage to stun the Serpent by slamming its head into a rock.Eustace, on the sand bar, wakes up. Aslan appears to him, and with a roar, burns off Eustace' dragon skin. Eustace wakes up, finding himself back in his old form, and with the Seventh Sword nearby. He takes it in hand and realizes that he is on Rhamandu's Island and can walk into the room of Aslan's Table. So while Dawn Treader's crew continue their desperate fight with the Serpent, and Edmund must struggle again with the temptation of the White Witch, Eustace races to the table and lays the last Sword on top of the other Six. The Mist tries to stop Eustace, but he disperses it with the sword.Edmund, of course, can't see Eustace doing this. But suddenly Peter's original sword, which he is carrying, turns bright blue. He realizes at once that the sword now is far more powerful than it ever was. So, though the White Witch (or her apparition) tries to dissuade him, he impales the Serpent with it. The Serpent dies and falls to the shallow bottom. The deep darkness lifts, and Dawn Treader is in daylight again. At Aslan's Table, the Three Lords awaken--and at the Dark Island, now no longer dark, every longboat of slaves that had gone to the Green Mist now comes out to meet Dawn Treader. Rhince and Gael are reunited with Helaine. Eustace then finds himself in the water, swimming to Dawn Treader. Reepicheep jumps in to rescue Eustace--and then they realize that the water is no longer sour, but sweet. Dawn Treader has now come within sight of Aslan's Country.Caspian, Lucy, Edmund, Eustace, and Reepicheep set out alone in a longboat to Aslan's Shore--which has a permanent, stationary breaker of surf on it. Aslan joins them there and informs them that their journey is at an end. Caspian, knowing that he would never return from an adventure into Aslan's Country, decides at the last instant to turn back, and go back to Narnia to govern it properly. Reepicheep is welcomed permanently into Aslan's Country, as has always been his destiny.Edmund says it's time for him, Lucy and Eustace to return home. Lucy understands that for her and Edmund, this is their last time in Narnia; they won't be returning. Aslan tells the Pevensies that they must now learn the name that Aslan bears on Earth, and their time on Narnia was intended to help them do that. Eustace is assured that he might be needed on Narnia once more, in the future.Aslan then sends Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace back to earth, back the way they came. They find themselves back in the room in Eustace' house. Eustace hangs the fallen painting back on the wall--and in it, Dawn Treader is sailing away from them. The film ends with Eustace' last diary record: that in the days that followed, the children spoke often of Narnia, and when the Pevensies leave, as they do once the war ends, Eustace will miss them. (But in a hint of the next intended sequel, Alberta Scrubb, Eustace' mother, shouts up to Eustace that a little girl named Jill Pole has stopped in for a visit.)"

Businessman and first time father (to-be), Peter Highman, is in Atlanta heading home to LA, where his wife is about to give birth, but after getting kicked off a plane, due to his seat mate, the pair end up trying to hitch a ride to the west coast.—Huggo Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) must get to LA in five days to be at the birth of his firstborn. He is about to fly home from Atlanta when his luggage and wallet are sent to LA without him, and he is put on the ""no-fly"" list. Desperate to get home Peter is forced to accept the offer of Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) to hitch a ride with him cross-country. Peter is about to go on the most terrifying and agonizing journey of his life.—Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) Enroute from Atlanta to Los Angeles via plane to be on time for the birth of his first child, Peter Highman instead runs into fellow-passenger/aspiring Hollywood actor, Ethan Tremblay, and has part of his baggage switched. Just when the flight is about to take off, Peter gets into a situation, is shot and subdued by an Air Marshall. When he regains his senses he finds he is on the 'No Fly List', no money/credit card, nor identification, and is compelled to hitch a ride with Ethan. Hoping to make it in time, he is has no idea that soon he will be assaulted by a 'handicapable' Western Union employee; get in a serious accident that will result in a fracture and several stitches; be on the run from Mexican Police; suspect his wife of having an affair with his friend, Darryl, and that the child may not even be his!!—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) High-strung architect Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is flying home to Los Angeles for the birth of his first child. Due to some Apatow-esque farcical events (which all seem to stem from child-like aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay (Zack Galifianakis), Peter ends up being shot by an air marshal and put on a no-fly list. As luck would have it, rescue comes in the form of Tremblay, who offers Peter a lift to LA, as Ethan himself is travelling to Hollywood to try his luck at becoming a ""real actor"".Straight away the two men's diametrically opposed personalities clash, and we discover that Ethan has a second motive for his travels: to scatter his recently deceased father's ashes. It is clear instantly that Highman has no patience for Tremblay, and this is not helped by the fact that Ethan decides to make a pitstop at the home of the nearest pot dealer, whom Tremblay ""found on craigslist - she's very legitimate"".The situation only deteriorates when the pair discover that they have $60 left, and to add insult to injury, Ethan spent $200 on weed. Peter decides to have money wired through to Ethan's account (his wallet, along with the rest of his luggage, were left on the plane), however when they set up the transaction, Ethan uses his stage name (Tremblay), yet only has ID showing his real surname, Chase. When the obnoxious cashier (Danny McBride), who just happens to be a ""handi-capable"", wheel-chair-ridden vet, decides to take matters into his own hands, and attacks Peter with what looks like a police truncheon, the situation spins out of control.When Ethan's attempts to prove himself a ""real actor"" by enacting scenes on request from Peter, end up exposing a more sensitive, human side to him, Peter appears to warm to Ethan. This doesn't last long, however, as Ethan's method of getting to sleep (masturbation) reminds Peter why he was so irritated by him in the first place. In the morning, as Ethan gets out of the car at a service station, Peter dumps Ethan's luggage and his pet dog Sonny out into the street before taking off in his car. To his dismay, he discovers Ethan's father's ashes in the car, and after wrestling with his conscience, decides to go back for Ethan, whom he convinces he simply went off to get them breakfast.The pair get back on the road again, but as soon as they seem to be getting back on track, Ethan, clearly sleep-deprived, falls asleep at the wheel, causing the car to career off a flyover, making it a write-off, and giving Peter a broken arm and some cracked ribs. Peter, clearly at the end of his tether, decides to ask for his friend Darryl (Jamie Foxx) to take him the rest of the way. Peter snaps at Ethan, telling him to abandon his dreams of becoming a Hollywood star, telling him he despises him, and spitting on Sonny. After some advice from Darryl, Peter decides to seek retribution for his outburst, and offers Ethan a lift too.Darryl takes the pair to his own house, where the conversation leads Ethan to accuse Darryl of having an affair with Peter's wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan), before Darryl reveals that the ""coffee"" they are drinking was from the coffee pot Ethan was carrying, which actually contained his father's ashes. Ethan breaks down in tears at the implications of this, to be consoled by Peter. Ethan's accusations are forgotten momentarily, however the seed is now planted, and Peter phones his wife and leaves a message asking her if she has anything to tell him.The pair get back on the road once again, and Ethan starts smoking weed. Peter, who had fallen asleep, wakes to find that, due to Ethan having locked the windows and doors, he too is stoned, as is the dog. This leads to a dreamlike sequence wherein Ethan appears to Peter as a massive hound. Through their shared intoxication, the pair have a heart to heart and Peter apologizes for his previous ""derogatory statements"" toward Ethan.The pair get distracted and end up getting stuck in the queue for the border crossing into Mexico. Because Peter is clearly not an experienced cannabis smoker, his erratic behaviour causes the border official (Paul Renteria) to become suspicious of them, despite Ethan's attempts to deceive the official into thinking his glazed eyes are caused by glaucoma. The border officer orders Ethan to cut the engine and hand over the keys to the car. As the official goes to confer with his colleague, Ethan calmly takes the pot of ashes and Sonny, and walks away from the car, leaving Peter to be interrogated by the official and his colleague (Marco Rodriguez) and told, ""You attempted to transport drugs across a national border. Dude, that's some serious shit.""In a further twist, Ethan shows up and rescues Peter in a daring escape involving a police chase and several counts of criminal damage, nicely summed up by Peter: ""How many laws did we just break?"" To repay Ethan for his daring rescue, Peter drives to the Grand Canyon so that Ethan can scatter the ashes. To reflect the poignant mood, Peter decides to confess to his earlier abandonment of Ethan, and Ethan reciprocates by telling Peter that he had his wallet all along, essentially meaning that all the preceding events were unnecessary: He had kept it in order to compel Peter into accompanying him. After initially being furious at this, Peter decides to prioritise, and at long last the companions arrive at the hospital just in time to see the birth of Rosie Highman. Due to blood loss, Peter collapses, and comes round to find that Ethan cut the umbilical cord.The film ends with Peter, wife, and baby watching an episode of the Charlie Sheen comedy series ""Two and a Half Men"", with a guest appearance by -- guess who -- Ethan Tremblay! (the show having been Ethan's reason for becoming an actor)."

On the way in Phil gives $20 to a couple who shares a sob story about how their car got towed and wont be released unless they pay $15. Phil & Claire say they know its a scam but agree to give $5, but Phil only has a 20. Phil steals a reservation from a no-show couple, the Tripplehorns, despite Claire's misgivings. While eating they are approached by two men, Collins (Common) and Armstrong (Jimmi Simpson), who question them about a flash drive they believe Phil and Claire stole from mobster boss Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta). Phil and Claire explain that they are not the Tripplehorns, but the men threaten them at gunpoint and don't believe them (They think Phil and Claire were using the Tripplehorn alias to blackmail Miletto and had written a ransom note to him under that name). Not seeing any other way out, Phil lies and tells them it's in a boathouse in Central Park.At the boathouse, Claire pretends to search; while Collins and Armstrong's backs are turned, Phil hits them with a paddle and escapes with Claire on a boat. At a police station, Phil and Claire talk with Detective Arroyo (Taraji P. Henson), but discover Collins and Armstrong are also detectives, presumably on Miletto's payroll.

They make a collect call home and ask the babysitter to take the kids to her home.Claire remembers a former client, Holbrooke Grant (Mark Wahlberg), a security expert and James Bond-like action hero. Claire knows the real estate firm from which Grant bought his apartment and breaks into its office to get Grant's address. He is consistently seen never wearing a shirt.

Arroyo reveals to Claire that she was notified by Grant, who supplied Phil with a wire.After being declared heroes, Phil and Claire enjoy breakfast at a diner, where Phil admits he would marry Claire and have their kids all over again if given the chance.

The Social Network,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As Harvard studentMark Zuckerbergcreates the social networking site that would become known as Facebook, he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea and by the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business. On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.—Columbia Pictures Every age has its visionaries who leave, in the wake of their genius, a changed world--but rarely without a battle over exactly what happened and who was there at the moment of creation. ""The Social Network"" explores the moment at which Facebook was invented--through the warring perspectives of the super-smart young men who each claimed to be there at its inception. The movie moves from the halls of Harvard to the cubicles of Palo Alto to capture the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making--and the way it both pulled a group of young revolutionaries together and then split them apart. In the midst of the chaos are Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the brilliant Harvard student who conceived a Web site; Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), once Zuckerberg's close friend, who provided the seed money for the fledgling company; Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who brought Facebook to Silicon Valley's venture capitalists; and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence), the Harvard classmates who asserted that Zuckerberg stole their idea and then sued him for ownership of it. Each has his own narrative, his own version of the Facebook story in this multi-level portrait of 21st Century success--both the youthful fantasy of it and its finite realities as well.—Columbia Pictures As told through flashbacks via deposition hearings for two concurrent lawsuits, the development and early days of the social networking website Facebook is presented. Harvard studentsMark Zuckerbergand Eduardo Saverin - officially listed as the co-founders of the website - were once best friends. Based on an on-line blog about his ex-girlfriend and a site he developed allowing its users to rate the hotness factor of girls on campus, Zuckerberg, who exhibited a streak of arrogance, was asked by fellow Harvardites, wealthy twinsCameron WinklevossandTyler Winklevoss, and their friend Divya Narendra, to enter into an agreement to develop a social networking website specifically for Harvard students, the attraction for people to visit it being its exclusivity solely to Harvard students. Zuckerberg agreed. Zuckerberg, with financing from his friend Saverin, decided instead to develop his own website without telling the ""Winklevi"" (as he calls the twins) and Narenda. Zuckerberg's assertion was that he never used a line of code provided by the three in his work. As ""thefacebook"" as it was then called began to blossom, the twins and Narenda had to figure out what to do to regain what they believed their intellectual property without having to sue, since that's not what gentlemanly Harvardites do. As the site was brought to more and more university campuses, Zuckerberg and Saverin began to have a difference of opinion: Saverin wanted to sell ad space to generate revenue (as he had been the website's sole financier and he had profit mentality based on being an economics major), while Zuckerberg, never one interested in money, didn't want to go that route as the ads would make the site lose its ""cool"" factor, which made it popular. The site attracted the attention of the founder of Napster, Sean Parker, whose own dot com life had its spectacular ups and spectacular downs. As Parker ingratiated himself into Facebook's life (much to Saverin's chagrin) and as Zuckerberg began increasingly to side with Parker, Saverin slowly began to be phased out of both Zuckerberg's personal and professional life.—Huggo The story of the creators of Facebook and the subsequent legal battles that stretched out over several years. Told mostly in flashbacks while Mark Zuckerberg gives depositions in two lawsuits, the idea of a shareable social information site came to him one night after he hacked into his school's database and published the photos of all the women at the school. One of his roommates, Eduardo Saverin, provides the upfront financing and Zuckerberg deftly outmaneuvers two other students who had a similar idea. The relationship with Saverin deteriorates and he soon finds himself on the outside looking in. All in all, an unflattering picture of all those involved.—garykmcd In October 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) has the idea to create a website to rate the attractiveness of female Harvard undergraduates after his girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) breaks up with him in the opening scene at a local bar after a bad date where his ego and abrasiveness brings out the worst in him. Over the course of a single night, a half-drunk Mark hacks into the databases of various residence halls, downloads pictures and names of female students and, using an algorithm for ranking chess players supplied by his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), he creates in a few hours a website called ""FaceMash.com"", where male students can interactively choose which of two girls presented at a time is more attractive.Mark is punished with six months of academic probation after the traffic to the site brings down parts of Harvard's computer network, and he becomes vilified among most of Harvard's female community. However, the popularity of ""FaceMash"" and the fact that he created it in one night, while drunk, brings him to the attention of Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie HammerandJosh Pence), identical twins and members of Harvard's rowing team, and their business partner Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). As a result, he gains a job working for the Winklevoss twins as the programmer of their website, Harvard Connection.Soon afterwards, Mark approaches his friend Eduardo and tells him of his idea for what he calls ""Thefacebook"", an online social networking website exclusive to Harvard University students. He explains this would let people share personal and social information securely. Eduardo agrees to help Mark, providing a fee of $1,000 to help start the site. Once complete, they distribute the link to Eduardo's connections at the Phoenix S-K final club, and it quickly becomes popular throughout the student body. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendar believe that Zuckerberg stole their idea while simultaneously stalling on their website. Cameron and Divya want to sue Mark for intellectual property theft, but Tyler convinces them they can settle the matter as ""Harvard gentlemen"" without resorting to the courts.A few months later, at a lecture by Bill Gates (Steve Sires), fellow Harvard University student Christy Lee (Brenda Song) introduces herself and her friend Alice (Melise) to Eduardo and Mark. She asks that the boys ""Facebook us"", which impresses both of them. The girls invite them to a bar, where they have sex in the toilet. Mark later runs into his ex-girlfriend, Erica, who is not aware of The Facebook's existence because she is not a Harvard University student. Stung by this, Mark decides to expand the site to more schools. Christy, Mark, and Eduardo later return to Mark's room where they outline the structure of the company and their plan for moving forward.By the spring of 2004, the Facebook grows in popularity, and it expands to other schools in the Northeastern United States, while the Winklevoss twins and Narendra become angrier at seeing ""their idea"" advance without them. Tyler refuses to sue them, instead accusing Mark of violating the Harvard student Code of Conduct. Through their father's connections they arrange a meeting with Harvard President Larry Summers (Douglas Urbanski), who is dismissive and sees no potential value in either a disciplinary action or in a lawsuit against Thefacebook website itself.Through Christy Lee, now Eduardo's girlfriend, Eduardo and Mark arrange a meeting with Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). When Christy, Mark and Eduardo meet Parker at a trendy Fusion restaurant in New York City, Eduardo becomes skeptical of the eccentric Parker, noting his problematic personal and professional history. Mark, however, is impressed with Parker since he presented a similar vision of Facebook. Although no deals are reached, Parker suggests that they drop ""The"" from Thefacebook to make it simply ""Facebook"".That summer, Mark moves the company's base of operation to Palo Alto, California at Parker's suggestion, while Eduardo remains in New York for seeking advertising support. When Eduardo visits from New York, he is angered to find that Parker is living at the house and making business decisions for Facebook. After an argument with Mark, the vindictive Eduardo freezes the company's bank account and returns to New York. Upon returning, Christy and Eduardo argue about his Facebook profile, which still lists him as ""single"". Christy accuses Eduardo of cheating on her and sets fire to a scarf he gave to her as a gift. While Eduardo extinguishes the fire, Mark angrily calls him on the phone about freezing the Facebook bank accounts, and reveals that they have secured money from ""an angel investor"" through Parker's contacts. As a result of Christy's jealousy, Eduardo ends his relationship with her.Meanwhile in England, while competing in the Henley Royal Regatta, the Winklevoss twins become outraged that Facebook has expanded to a number of universities there and they finally decide to sue Mark. Eduardo has also discovered the deal he signed with Parker's investors allows them to dilute his share of the company from a third to less than one tenth of one percent, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts his erstwhile friend Mark at his new Facebook office in downtown L.A. and announces his intention to sue him.Later that night, Parker, along with a number of Facebook interns, is arrested for possession of cocaine during a party thrown on the occasion of Facebook's 1 millionth member. It is strongly implied (but never fully explained) that Mark had anonymously tipped off the police to raid the frat house where the party was held and probably had someone plant drugs at the party to intentionally have Parker and his interns arrested to remove them from the Facebook company.In the final scene, a junior lawyer for the defense informs Mark they will be settling with Eduardo, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Mark's cynical personality will make a jury highly unsympathetic to him. The film ends with Mark sending a friend request to his former girlfriend Erica on Facebook, and refreshing the page every few seconds waiting for a response that never comes.Several final on-screen texts state that the Winklevoss twins agreed to a settlement of $65 million and signed a non-disclosure agreement. They later went on to row in the Beijing Olympics and arrive at sixth place.Eduardo received an unknown settlement and has his name placed back on the masthead as Facebook's Co-Founder.And that Facebook now has 500 million users in 207 countries and is valued at over $25 billion. Therefore making Mark Zuckerberg the youngest self-made billionaire in the world."

Just as her friend Charlotte must deal with her young daughter's ""terrible two's"", Carrie must deal with her relationship taking a turn for the worse - Big likes to watch old black-and-white movies on TV and eat take-out food, which prevents Carrie from feeling like the free-wheeling party girl she used to be.

In a violent post-apocalyptic society, a drifter, Eli (Denzel Washington), has been wandering westward across North America for the last thirty years. He finds solace in a unique book which he carries on his person and guards closely, while surviving by hunting small animals and seeking goods in destroyed houses and vehicles to trade in villages for water and supplies. When he reaches a village ruled by the powerful mobster, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), the man views Eli's impressive fighting skills and offers Eli a place within his gang. Carnegie presses his blind lover Claudia (Jennifer Beals) to send her daughter, Solara (Mila Kunis), to at least convince Eli to spend the night by sleeping with him. However, Eli proves to be the better man when he gently declines her advances. The girl sees Eli's book, and when Carnegie finds out he beats her mother until she reveals what she saw. Carnegie sends his gang into the wasteland to take the book from Eli, but the man proves to be a formidable foe as he makes it more than clear that if they want the book, they must first take his life.—Harry Jankel, London, England In a post-apocalyptic America where the once-picturesque countryside has become a desolate and violent wasteland, one man (Denzel Washington) fights to protect a sacred tome that could hold the key to the survival of the human race in this futuristic thriller from filmmaking duo Albert and Allen Hughes (From Hell (2001) and Dead Presidents (1995)). Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, and Ray Stevenson co-star in this Warner Brothers production.—ahmetkozan Scavenging for food to eke out an existence in the carcass of a dystopian post-apocalyptic America, the solitary survivor and cryptic bearer of the ultimate prize, Eli, depends on his uncanny and infallible skills to stay alive and fulfil his mission of redemption. On this scorched earth, there's only one other man who grasps the grave significance of Eli's precious cargo; the absolute ruler, Carnegie, who will stop at nothing to get his hands on it. For more than three decades, this has been Eli's burden and the reason to live; however, his journey to the west is not over yet. Who can stop the chosen one from reaching his final destination?—Nick Riganas Thirty years after a nuclear apocalypse, Eli (Denzel Washington) travels on foot toward the west coast of US. Along the way, he demonstrates survival and fighting skills, hunting wildlife and swiftly defeating a group of highway bandits who try to ambush him. Searching for a source of water, he arrives in a ramshackle town built and overseen by Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie dreams of building more towns and controlling the people by using the power of a certain book. His henchmen scour the desolate landscape daily in search of it, but to no avail.In the local town bar, Eli is set upon by a gang of bikers and he kills them all. Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself, Carnegie asks Eli to stay, although it is made clear the offer is non-negotiable. After Carnegie's blind concubine Claudia (Jennifer Beals) gives Eli some food and water, Carnegie orders Claudia's daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) to seduce Eli. Eli turns her down, but she discovers he has a book in his possession. Eli pacifies her with stern words, but offers to share his food with her. Before they eat, though, he has her pray with him. The following day, Solara prays with her mother. Carnegie overhears them and realizes Solara's words may relate to the book he has been seeking. Through violence, he forces Solara to tell him Eli was reading a book. When he asks what kind, she says she does not know but forms a cross with her two index fingers. Carnegie realizes Eli has a copy of the Bible, the book he has been seeking. Eli sneaks out of his room and goes to the store across the street, where he had earlier asked the Engineer (Tom Waits) to recharge his battery for his portable music player.Carnegie attempts to stop Eli by having all his henchmen shoot at him, but the bullets seemingly just graze him, as if he is being protected. Eli shoots most of Carnegie's henchmen and hits Carnegie in the leg with a shotgun blast. After Eli leaves, Solara follows him and leads him to the source of the town's water supply, hoping she can accompany him on his travels. Eli traps her inside and continues on alone. Solara escapes and soon finds herself ambushed by two bandits who attempt to sexually assault her, but Eli appears and kills them.As they continue on, Eli explains to Solara the nature of his journey. According to Eli, his book is the last remaining copy of the Bible, as all other copies were intentionally destroyed following the nuclear war. He says he was led to the book by a voice, which then directed him to travel westward to a place where it would be safe. The voice assured him that he would be protected on his journey. Thus, for the last thirty years he has traveled west, guided by his faith.Eventually, Eli and Solara arrive at a strange house. They stop to investigate and quickly fall through a trap door. The residents, Martha (Frances De La Tour) and George (Michael Gambon), invite them in for tea. When the travelers realize that the couple are cannibals, they attempt to leave quickly, but they bump into Carnegie and his posse outside the house. Eli, Solara, Martha, and George hole up inside the house. A shootout ensues, leading to the deaths of some of Carnegie's men, as well as George and Martha. Eli and Solara are captured. Carnegie threatens to kill Solara, which prompts Eli to hand over the Bible. Carnegie shoots him, and leaves him for dead.While in transit, Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli. Rather than chase her, Carnegie chooses to return to the town with the Bible, since his vehicle is running out of fuel. Solara picks Eli up and they continue west until they reach the Golden Gate Bridge. They then row to Alcatraz, where they find a group of survivors. Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the King James version of the Bible, and they are allowed in. Once inside, they are introduced to Lombardi (Malcolm McDowell), the curator. Eli, who is revealed to be blind, begins to dictate the Bible from memory.Meanwhile, back in the town, Carnegie manages to open the locked Bible with the help of his Engineer, but he is horrified to discover that it is a Braille copy. He is unable to persuade Claudia to read it for him. Carnegie's leg wound has become septic, and he realizes he will die without making use of the Bible. Claudia laughs because Carnegie lost too many men chasing Eli and the book. Without enough manpower to keep order, the people of his town take control. Eli finishes dictating the Bible after being shaved and cleaned; he dies, presumably from his wounds, shortly thereafter. The printing press at Alcatraz begins printing the new King James Bible, after which Lombardi places a copy on the bookshelf between copies of the Torah and Tanakh on one side and the Qur'an on the other. Solara is offered sanctuary in Alcatraz, but she instead chooses to head back home, bringing along with her the possessions that once belonged to Eli."

Things begin to get complicated when one of the crew members falls in love with Claire. The Charlestown neighborhood of Boston is renowned for churning out a high number of armed robbers, generation after generation. These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug's mother ran off and Doug's father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. But leaving is not as easy as he would like as he and the gang are tasked with a big job by a local gangster named Fergie whether Doug likes it or not. And Adam Frawley, the FBI's lead investigator, comes into evidence that links the foursome to the bank robbery and a subsequent armored car heist, so is on their tail for evidence that will send them away dead or alive.—Huggo In Boston's bleak Charlestown, criminals depend on a code of silence: those caught serve their time. Doug MacRay masterminds bank robberies with three friends: the hotheaded Jem; Des, an electrician; and Al, their driver. After a dicey bank job, Doug must make sure the female bank manager, Claire, who lives in Charlestown, hasn't recognized any of the crew. He contrives to meet her, finds out she doesn't know any of the crew and, in the process, finds her appealing. As the FBI zeroes in on the gang, Doug wants out of the crew, but Jem and their money launderer, an aging florist, insist that Doug do one more job. Are prison and death the only ways out of Charlestown?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> After the heist of the Cambridge Merchants Bank, the four thieves blindfold and kidnap the manager Claire Keesey. They take her driver license; release her at an empty beach; and head to Charlestown, Boston. Later, the friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan and Desmond Elden find that Claire also lives in Charlestown and they decide to monitor her steps. Doug MacRay gets close to Claire to know what she might have told to the FBI and they fall in love with each other. Meanwhile, the FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley is assigned to investigate the heists to armored trucks and banks in Charlestown and he concludes that the thieves are the four friends. He joins his team and keeps Doug and his friends under surveillance. Doug decides to move to Florida with Claire and begin a new life; however, the dwellers are trapped in Charlestown and they do not have any way out but dead.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug's crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they're also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug's fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him; Jem (Jeremy Renner), the most dangerous of the bunch, is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn't suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug's true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he's ever known.

A second after the courier enters the bank, the four gang members burst through the front doors and overpower him. Coughlin and Gloansy leap over the teller's desks, and subdue the tellers and guards. Gloansy empties a fish bowl filled with peppermints, and orders everyone present to place their cell phones in it. Everyone complies, and Gloansy then proceeds to fill the bowl with water. Coughlin then begins searching the drawers for money, careful to not take any wads with dye packs. While this happens, Des runs upstairs and begins disabling the security tapes. Doug secures the doors with a cable tie, then grabs assistant branch manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) and leads her over to the vault at gunpoint.Doug and Coughlin train their weapons on Claire, and Doug asks her what the time lock is set for. She tells him it is set for 9:00 AM. He assures her it's not her money it is after. When the clock hits 8:15, Doug tells her ""go"" and she pretends to start to unlock the vault. Seeing Claire stalling, Coughlin trains his weapon on another employee and threatens to shoot him if she doesn't cooperate. Doug puts his hand on top of Claire's trembling hand and tells her to take her time. She slowly spins the combination, and the vault is unlocked.While Doug enters the vault and begins loading the money into duffel bags, Des ejects the security tapes and puts them in a wastebasket. He then hauls them down to the breakroom and puts the tapes in the microwave, destroying them.Back in the lobby, there is a knock at the door from a customer trying to get in, distracting Doug, Coughlin, and Gloansy. Claire, lying on her stomach, takes advantage of the distraction to use her foot to trip the silent alarm. Realizing that they have less time than they planned, Coughlin now proceeds to douse everything with a large jug of bleach. They prepare to depart, but are stopped when Dez tells them the silent alarm has been tripped. Coughlin flies into a fit of rage, demanding to know who set the alarm off. The bank president (Victor Garber) insists he hasn't touched it. Coughlin doesn't believe him and proceeds to whip him across the head multiple times with his submachine gun, and continues to do so until Doug stops him. As Doug is restraining Coughlin, Claire looks up and notices a distinct Fighting Irish tattoo of a man with a thief bag and pistol on the back of Coughlin's neck. The crew finish dousing every surface they can find with bleach. Coughlin takes notice of Claire and realizes she will be useful to them.Once Doug finishes bleaching the vault, he comes out and immediately notices that Claire is missing. He then finds Coughlin and the others have taken her hostage, to use as a shield if the police show up. They lead her out the back door to a side alleyway, where they climb into a stolen electricians' work van. Gloansy takes the driver's seat while Doug, Dez, and Coughlin climb in back with Claire, wrists bound with cable ties. Once she is blindfolded, the gang remove their masks and Doug tells Claire she will be all right. They drive her to a beach near Logan International Airport, and let her out. Doug tells her not to remove her blindfold until she walks forward far enough to feel the surf on her toes.As she reaches the water, the screen goes black and the words, ""The Town,"" appear on the screen.Back in Harvard Square, the crime scene investigation into the bank robbery is underway. FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and his partner Dino Ciampa (Titus Welliver) arrive to look at the scene. Dino notes that the robbers stole a city work van, which hasn't yet been reported stolen. He notes that the van was used to screen the front doors, and the robbers bleached the entire place to destroy all clothing fibers and any trace evidence of themselves. Examining the vault, Frawley observes that the robbers were careful not to take any of the bands of money fitted with dye packs and tracers. They are called away when Frawley receives a text on his BlackBerry, telling him that the getaway van has been discovered, and, almost as if expected, torched.Indeed, the robbers have dumped the van on Medford Street in Charlestown, near the Tobin Memorial Bridge, and lit it on fire to destroy any evidence of themselves. When Frawley and Dino arrive at the scene, the fire department is just finishing putting out the blaze. Since all the professional robbers they know of are dead or in prison, the detectives conclude that they are dealing with a band of new professionals. Frawley is quick to determine that there likely are no eyewitnesses who may have seen the robbers.Doug meets with Coughlin, Dez and Gloansy at an abandoned hockey rink. Coughlin tells them that they've got a little problem. He produces Claire's driver's license and tells them that she lives in the neighborhood, meaning that there's a chance she'll see them and recognize them. Coughlin proposes that they kill her and offers to take care of it. Doug snatches the license from Coughlin and asserts that he will take care of Claire, since Coughlin is responsible for their predicament and he will face prison time if he tries to intimidate a witness.Simultaneously, Frawley is interviewing Claire at his office in One Beacon Street about her actions after she was taken hostage. She confirms that the men threatened to rape and kill her if she talked to the police, and took her driver's license, and that she did not try to escape. When asked by Frawley if she remembers any distinguishing marks on the four robbers, she doesn't bother to tell him about Coughlin's tattoo. Frawley observes that Claire's hands are trembling, and tells her that she is still suffering the residual effects from the events of the robbery. He assures her they are not inept cops.Frawley explains to Claire that there were over 370 bank robberies in the city in the past year, more per capita than anywhere else in the world, but 98% of them come from a one square mile neighborhood called Charlestown. In fact, it is standard Boston Police Department procedure to close the Charlestown Bridge when they get word of an armored car robbery in the city. Bank robbery is a predominant trade in Charlestown, just like old European villages specialized in certain crafts for trade. Claire is shocked, as this is the neighborhood she lives in. Before releasing her, Frawley tells Claire she is being set up with a protective detail and hands her his business card. Claire takes one look at a photograph of a police blockade at the Charlestown Bridge. Her gaze then sees a surveillance photo on a bulletin board of a masked Doug and Coughlin holding her at gunpoint.Doug and Coughlin go to Mike, one of their fences. While they are waiting, they converse on the couch. It is clear that Doug is disenchanted with his criminal lifestyle and wants out of it. They exchange some of the money for 100 pounds of marijuana. After selling the marijuana to another dealer, they go to Town Flowers to deliver a cut of the loot to local crime boss Fergus ""Fergie"" Colm, Following this, the gang goes to Mohegan Sun to gamble the money away.Returning to Boston, Doug and the others head to a local bar. It is established that Doug is in rehab for alcoholism, since he has to drink juice when everyone else can drink regular beer. As he is getting juice at the counter, he is approached by his girlfriend, Coughlin's sister Krista (Blake Lively). It is clear as they converse that Krista is xenophobic, as they are talking about a fight she had with a Somalian woman and had two friends to help her out.Doug dismisses himself and goes back to his apartment. He is in the middle of watching the drive-in movie theater shootout fromHeat (1995)when Krista stops by to have sex with him. Later that night, when he finds himself unable to sleep, he uses a hockey stick to toss a puck in the air a few times.The next day, after sitting through a boring Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Doug goes to work tailing Claire. He observes her as she leaves her apartment and heads to a local Laundromat to wash her laundry. He sits down in front of one of the washing machines and pretends to read a newspaper, while keeping an eye on Claire. Doug gets lucky when she approaches him and asks him if he has any change she can use. He apologizes and claims he doesn't have any quarters for her. He then watches as Claire folds her clothes and begins to put them in a basket to take back to her apartment. As Doug watches, she stops upon finding a shirt that has blood droplets on it. Claire has a flashback as she recalls Coughlin beating her boss up with his gun, and recalls walking slowly along the beach after she was released. Noticing her starting to cry, Doug sees this as an opportunity to move in, and asks her if she is all right. He flirts with her and offers to buy her a drink to make up for the bad week she has been having and to make up for not having any quarters for her. He asks, ""What's the worst that could happen?""The scene cuts to Frawley and Dino raiding a crackhouse owned by a man named Henry. Though he attempts to escape, Frawley is able to eventually subdue him after a struggle, and discovers a pistol and illegal drugs. He asks Henry if he knows anything about the bank robbery. He admits that he knows these professionals disable the alarm for the vault by breaking into the junction box.Meanwhile, Doug takes Claire out to dinner at a local restaurant owned by one of his former hockey friends. Doug reveals that he works for a local gravel company. Claire is intrigued by Doug's hockey roots and mentions that she volunteers at a local boy's and girls' club that would like to reutilize the ice rink (the one we saw Doug meet with the others in earlier) but the city of Boston has refused to give them money. She also wonders why a few of the neighborhood kids have been calling her a 'Tunie', and Doug explains that it's a term used to describe people who are not from Charlestown, originating in the 1990s to describe the fancy car radios which the rich folks brought to the neighborhood and which are stolen by the ""native"" residents. In spite of being attracted to Claire, Doug is forced to make up some lies about himself, for instance claiming that his father lives out in the suburbs (and by the 'suburbs', he means the Cedar Junction Penitentiary in Walpole). He also admits that he thinks his mother left and now lives down in Florida. Claire admits that she comes from Marblehead, where she represented the underclass because her family didn't own a boat (which is the item that determines your status in Marblehead). Doug assures her he has a friend who owns a boat and Doug suggests that they should continue their date there (though it's heavily implied that it's probably actually stolen).During their moonlight boat ride, Claire questions Doug about bank robbers since he is from Charlestown and she recalls her interview with Frawley at the station. Doug admits that many things that people say about bank robbers in Charlestown are just exaggerations. He also says that back in the days many juveniles admired the bank robbers just as if they were rockstars, and wanted to emulate their idols. Doug, however, admits that he always just wanted to play hockey but was just not good enough to join a professional team.Doug meets with Coughlin at a small diner the next day. Coughlin asks Doug what his progress is with Claire. He lies and says he's got nothing, and she doesn't need to be killed.Frawley and Dino look at the junction box outside the bank as a Vericom utility crew works to patch it up. The supervisor notes that the way the crew hacked the box is so unique that the only way one could know how to do it is to get a job at Vericom. This leads the two agents to decide that at least one of the robbers might be a Vericom employee and may have called in sick on the day of the robbery. Frawley then meets with Claire at another restaurant to ask her some more questions over lunch. Claire asks Frawley if he thinks she is a suspect. He tells her that if he did, he wouldn't be questioning her over lunch. There's a quick distraction when Frawley's BlackBerry rings, having received a surveillance picture of a man holding up a credit union with a pistol.Doug and Claire go on another date. While they're sitting in his truck outside her apartment, she talks about Doug's attack on her bank. As she talks, Doug learns that she's talked to the police, but he breathes a sigh of relief knowing that the police haven't yet identified him and his gang as responsible for the job. He also learns that David, the branch manager that Coughlin beat up, is in the hospital nearby and Claire feels terrible that she hasn't been able to see him since the robbery.Doug and Claire go to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to meet David. Doug is a bit hesitant due to the presence of a police officer guarding the door, but Claire assures him he will be okay. When they enter David's hospital room, Doug is aghast to notice that his entire forehead and right eye are wrapped in bandages from where Coughlin whipped him, and the doctors give David a 50% chance of the eyesight in his right eye returning. He is more depressed when he steps outside and talks with the police officer on guard duty about it.Later, Doug and Claire are at a Dunkin' Donuts consuming drinks. Claire admits that she hasn't told the police about Coughlin's ""Fighting Irish"" tattoo, and she's afraid to tell Frawley this out of the possibility that she might be called to testify and her risk of getting killed will increase.Later, while dropping Claire off, Doug asks about the Toyota Prius he saw her grab clothes from when he was surveying her, and Claire reveals it got vandalized by some neighborhood kids. She then reveals that there have been some other people who have been harassing her as she walks to work, throwing bottles and taunting her. Doug asks Claire if she recalls what they looked like.Armed with a description of the men harassing Claire, Doug solicits help from Coughlin, though he doesn't tell Coughlin what the job is for. They approach another dealer and get an address for the two men. Doug and Coughlin pull up across the street from the residence in question, don hockey masks, then grab a baseball bat and make their way to the apartment. When they knock on the door, the tenant, Alex Colazzo, walks over to answer. As he opens the door, Doug and Coughlin barge in and begin beating him and his friend up. While Doug controls himself, Coughlin is more vicious, striking his hand with a hammer and smashing a beer bottle over his head. Lastly, Coughlin shoots Colazzo once in each leg. Doug scatters some packs of cocaine dust around to make it look like a drug deal gone wrong, and he and Coughlin depart, unnoticed by the responding cops, who are rolling dark as they respond to what they think is a domestic disturbance.The police begin to narrow in on the gang when they identify Desmond Elden, who works for Vericom as a systems tech operator. Even though he does not have a criminal record, Dino explains to Frawley that most bank robbers in Charlestown have no-show jobs. They will carry out a job, and when the police question the foreman, he will tell them the guy was present and show them a forged timecard. Fortunately for the cops, Vericom does not do such a practice because they are a public company, meaning that failure to show up at work is recorded as a sick day, and Des has recorded several sick days that ""coincidentally"" fell on the same days as a number of recent armed robberies of either banks or armored cars. Frawley and Dino tail Des and take several surveillance photographs of him with Doug, Gloansy and Coughlin at a barbecue. They produce their photos and brief their colleagues on their other three suspects:-Gloansy is a notorious car thief, who has never met a car he couldn't boost. He's the kind of man who can start your Cherokee for you while you're still looking for your keys (overlaid with footage of Gloansy breaking into a Jeep Grand Cherokee in a parking lot).-Coughlin has a troubled life. His father was murdered in prison, and his mother died of HIV. When he was 18, he shot a boy dead in a cemetery. When asked by the judge why he did it, he said he didn't like the kid, and ultimately served nine years for manslaughter.-Doug is the suspected architect. He used to date Coughlin's sister Krista, who most likely mules to ""the Florist"" (Fergie), who formerly employed Doug's father Stephen MacRay. He also did a year and a half in prison for robbing a BayBank with a nail gun after he washed out from pro hockey. He apparently had been the real deal, and got drafted, but got kicked out when he started fighting with the guys on his own team. It is here that we learn more about what Doug's father is in prison for: in 1995, he hijacked a bread truck (armored truck) up to Nashwood, New Hampshire. When one guard saw his face, he executed both of them with their own weapons. Frawley notes that this consequentially led to new rules saying that an armored car driver is not allowed to leave the cab even if his partner is being held at gunpoint.Doug is next seen having lunch with Claire at an outdoor café not far from the bank. He's stunned her friends are not jealous of her for dating him. He notices an odd look on Claire's face and learns that she had a brother of died of lymphoma on a sunny day like this, and she finds it wrong to think about death whenever it is sunny outside. When Claire excuses herself to use the bathroom, Coughlin shows up to confront Doug. He is still there when Claire gets back, forcing Doug to use his hand to cover Coughlin's neck tattoo and improvise a story. After some tense conversation, Coughlin leaves.Doug confronts Coughlin later for stalking him and Claire. Coughlin defends himself by arguing that Doug is endangering them by sleeping with the one person who could give them to the police. Doug also doesn't like the next planned assignment - an armored car robbery in the North End. Doug doesn't like the fact that there is a guard assigned to the vehicle that acts like he's G.I. Joe. Doug finally agrees to do it, on the condition that this be their last job for a while.Doug next pays a visit to his father at the Cedar Junction Penitentiary. Doug talks about how he wants to leave his criminal life, to which his father advises him ""Either you got heat or you don't.""That night, Doug has sex with Claire. The next morning, he leads the gang as they carry out a blitz attack on an armored car in the North End. Before leaving their base, they grab some shaved hair from a barbershop. The four shower and scrub themselves vigorously, to get rid of any loose skin that could get on their clothes and leave DNA for the police to track them. As they load their weapons, they not only wipe down and polish the weapons themselves, but they also wipe down every single bullet that they load into each clip.Once they are ready, Doug, Coughlin and Gloansy pile into a Dodge Grand Caravan, throw some filled gasoline jugs in the back, and drive to the North End, with Gloansy driving.As Doug, Coughlin and Gloansy arrive at the ambush location, outside a bank at the corner of Parmenter and Salem Streets, they find that the armored truck is running late. They are forced to circle once around the block while they wait, to avoid suspicion. As they complete their first go-around, they see the armored truck pull up to the curb. Gloansy tells Doug and Coughlin, ""Say your prayers. Here we go."" All three men proceed to don rubber masks, complete with wrinkled faces and nun's veils. Doug looks out the window, and a young boy on the sidewalk locks eyes with Doug, horrified at the appearance of a submachine gun wielding ""nun"".In real time, Gloansy speeds up, blows through a crosswalk, rounds the corner, and screeches to a halt alongside the armored truck. Even before he has brought the van to a stop, the left passenger door flies open and Doug and Coughlin jump out. The guard on the sidewalk instinctively grabs for his pistol, but Doug disarms him with the barrel of his submachine gun. Meanwhile, Coughlin rushes up and overpowers the guard in the back of the truck, then proceeds to break open the cabinets protecting the money. Doug shoves the bags on the dolly over to the van and begins watching the street for police, while Coughlin loads the money he can grab into a satchel.There is a pause when Gloansy hears the distress call about the robbery going out on his police scanner. He yells this to Doug and Coughlin, indicating that they need to finish up. Coughlin looks up and notices that the truck driver has left his seat. He turns around and sees that the driver has taken Doug hostage and is holding a pistol to his back. Doug urges the driver to calm down and let him go. The driver doesn't move until Coughlin appears with his carbine and fires a burst, hitting the driver in the chest. He survives, though, thanks to his bulletproof vest. Doug and Coughlin hurriedly jump into the back of the van with their money and they speed off.As they drive off, Doug tells Gloansy to drive slow and act normal. However, just as they are going around a corner a few blocks away from the scene, Doug looks behind them and sees a police car. Just as he recognizes it, the police car immediately turns on its siren and gives chase. Gloansy punches the gas pedal all the way to the floor, and makes several quick turns, trying to shake off their pursuers, and inadvertently causing a couple of small pileups as other vehicles try to get out of the way. As they are making another right turn at a three-way intersection, a second police car driving on another street notices them, stops, then backs up and turns onto the street they are on right behind the first police car.Gloansy continues to gain speed, trying to outrun the cops. The first police car gains on them, and as they enter a three way intersection, it proceeds to carry out a PIT maneuver. It pulls up alongside the van, and then it forcibly swerves into the side of the van's rear bumper. Gloansy is unable to maintain control, and the van spins around and screeches to a stop.The two police cars come to a halt in front of the van. The officer in the first cruiser gets on his microphone and orders them out of the car. When they don't act right away, he repeats his command. Suddenly, Coughlin raises his carbine and fires a burst through the front windshield. Bullets pound the forward unit and the officer driving the car jumps out, crawling away under heavy gunfire. While Coughlin is firing, they hear more sirens and another police car screeches a stop, cutting them off from the other direction. Doug opens his door, leans across the roof, and opens fire on the police car, riddling its engine block with bullets. The officer in the third police car jumps out, draws his pistol and fires two rounds at Doug, before he is forced to take cover. Coughlin and Doug fire further suppressive bursts on the police as Gloansy backs the minivan up past the third police car to another cross street, then makes a hard left turn and speeds off. The second police car to arrive quickly speeds off in hot pursuit.Gloansy continues to barrel through the streets at high speed, rounding the corners as the three men struggle to shake off the pursuing police car. With a long and straight stretch of open road in front of them, Gloansy accelerates to full speed, as they speed towards the switch point. Reaching another cross street, the gang almost loses control when another police car pulls off a side street at high speed and rams them from the left side around their front headlight, trying to force them off the road. The two cars trade paint for a few hundred feet, during which the van's left front hubcap breaks off, until the next intersection, where Gloansy is able to make a right hand turn while this police car brakes to avoid a collision with a guardrail, then gets t-boned by another motorist.Still being tailed by the other police car, Gloansy makes several tight turns through the narrow streets until he makes a right hand turn onto Foster Street. Halfway down the block, a stolen Jeep Grand Cherokee driven by Des pulls out of the lot and stops in front of them. Gloansy brakes to a stop, and the police cars chasing them come to a stop behind them. The three men in the minivan promptly climb out. The officers simultaneously climb out of their cars, pistols in hand. Before they can shoot, Coughlin raises his rifle and opens fire, riddling their cars with bullets and sending them diving for cover. While Coughlin keeps the police officers pinned down, Doug grabs the money bags and douses the interior of the car with the gasoline jugs. He then tosses a lit cigarette lighter into the car. The police officers instinctively run, just as the gasoline ignites, causing the interior of the minivan to explode in a ball of flames. Doug and the gang jump into the Jeep and peel away, tires screeching.The Jeep bursts out onto Commercial Street. Gloansy drives recklessly through traffic as he turns left and begins driving in the direction of the Charlestown Bridge. Just then, the other crew members overhear a dispatcher sending several police units to the north end of the bridge to block it. Gloansy immediately presses his pedal to the floor and is soon hitting in excess of 80 mph as he weaves through traffic, even driving against the flow trying to get there in time. They reach the bridge, and after a few maneuvers to navigate around traffic moving through the intersection, they turn right on Washington Street and roar across the bridge. They are already halfway cross the bridge and long gone by the time the police arrive.Gloansy drives the car back to Charlestown, untouched, and parks it on Tufts Street at O'Reilly Way. Doug and the gang jump out, Coughlin planting the hair we saw being acquired from the barbershop earlier in the backseat. They have only just started preparing to transfer everything to their second switch car when they see something that stops them dead in their tracks: a police officer is sitting in his car parked directly across the street from them, and staring at them. The four armed robbers stare tensely at the officer, who stares back at them as both parties wonder what to do. After a few tense moments, the standoff is broken when officer turns his head away from them as if to look at some utility workers working nearby. Doug, Gloansy, Dez, and Coughlin finish transferring everything to a Ford Taurus stationwagon and drive off, the officer deciding it wiser not to chase them. In the stationwagon, Coughlin quips the officer didn't want his name on the VFW memorial wall.Frawley and Dino are next seen looking at the burned out remains of the minivan. Frawley is agitated, as there isn't enough evidence at any of the scenes to secure a conviction, so he orders the police to round up the suspects for questioning.The next day, the police round up the four men and take them to the police station to be photographed and interrogated. Unfortunately for Frawley, his suspects are much smarter than he thinks they are. Frawley attempts to question Coughlin, who merely says ""Lawyer!"" Frawley leaves without saying another word. Doug and Gloansy each are told to read some lines from a transcript of a witness statement, to mixed results: Doug mumbles his way through the lines, while Gloansy reads the first few lines before acting like he can't read them.Doug is brought to an interrogation room. He recognizes Dino, having apparently had run ins with him in Charlestown before. When Frawley enters to interrogate Doug, he makes it absolutely clear there is little chance of him getting a reduced sentence by testifying against his accomplices. But Doug proves too smart for Frawley, and he is forced to release the four. Frawley leaves Doug with a warning that he will do whatever it takes to make a charge stick, and will then tell Doug to 'go fuck himself.'Jem approaches Doug with another job, but he turns it down. He tells Fergie he will not do the job, but Fergie reveals that Doug's mother never left the family. She committed suicide after Fergie got her addicted to drugs in retaliation for Doug's father attempting to also leave and warns that he will kill Claire if Doug does not do the job. Doug finally agrees.The job starts Doug and Jem enter Fenway Park dressed as Boston police officers, wearing sunglasses to hide their identitites, while Dez deactivates the security system. Doug and Jem approach the guards near the cash room and pretend to be responding to a 911 call, then draw pistols on the guards and force them to the ground, zip-tying their hands behind their backs. They then threaten the men in the cash room to get him to let them in. After securing these men, they load $3 million into their duffel bags and head over to their getaway vehicle, an ambulance parked in the garage, where they meet Gloansy and Dez and change into paramedic uniforms. Unfortunately, they sense that it is too quiet, look outside, and see that the police are taking up positions outside. When Jem spots an FBI SWAT team in the garage, he opens fire on them. A shootout erupts, and in the process, several SWAT officers in the garage are wounded, and Dez is killed when he is deafened by a flash grenade (Doug, Jem and Gloansy cover their ears) and then shot by a SWAT officer. Gloansy offers to sacrifice himself to protect Doug and Jem, gets into the ambulance, and bursts out of the parking garage. The police fire on the van, hitting Gloansy at least twice, and the ambulance crashes into a mobile command center. As the cops move in on the ambulance, Doug and Jem in the garage put on their cop uniforms, blending in with the BPD officers moving in, and they go separate ways.Frawley figures out the ruse when he overhears a police captain talking to Dino about how the robbery was committed by two cops. He scans the officers on the scene, then he and Dino drive slowly through the area near Fenway Park, spotting one cop walking away from the action carrying a duffel bag. They realize it is ""Officer"" Coughlin. Frawley immediately gets out of his car and follows Coughlin into a parking lot, just as Doug emerges out a door nearby. Frawley tries to get Coughlin's attention, but Coughlin does not respond until Frawley addresses him by name. On cue, Coughlin turns around, a TEC-9 automatic in his hand, and opens fire on Frawley. Frawley dives for cover as Coughlin chases him around a parked car, riddling the car with bullets. After pinning Frawley down, Coughlin runs off. Frawley gets to his feet and fires a single blast with his shotgun, before running after Coughlin.As Coughlin reaches Boylston Street, multiple police cars screech to a halt from both directions. Doug reaches the sidewalk and can only watch what happens next. The moment the responding BPD cruisers come to a stop, Coughlin immediately opens fire on them. Several officers jump out and begin shooting back with their pistols. In the vicious exchange of gunfire, at least two officers get shot (although whether they survived or not is never mentioned). There is a brief delay when Frawley's aim is obstructed by a passing motorist trying to get past the police cars blocking the road. Once the car clears, one police officer breaks cover, aims his pistol, and shoots Coughlin in the chest. Coughlin falls, unharmed due to his bulletproof vest, and fires several more bursts in both directions. He then tries to run, but Frawley takes aim with his shotgun and fires twice. The first blast shatters the glass on a newspaper vending machine, while the second blast hits Coughlin in the back of his leg and knocks him down. He crawls back behind a mailbox to ponder his options.More police, backed up by the FBI SWAT team, arrive and train their weapons on the mailbox Coughlin is hiding behind. Frawley yells for Coughlin to surrender. Coughlin then empties his Glock pistols at a police car, raking it with bullets. Frawley gives Coughlin 30 seconds to comply. Coughlin takes the opportunity to enjoy a discarded soda left on the sidewalk. He then yells that he surrenders, and stands up, raising his now emptied TEC-9s. A SWAT officer almost immediately shoots him through the head. As Coughlin's body is blown backwards against a telephone pole, multiple cops proceed to empty their pistols into him, and he falls to the ground, dead. While Frawley and a few uniformed cops approach the fallen Coughlin with their weapons drawn, Doug quietly climbs into a police car and drives off, unnoticed amidst the chaos.Doug drives the BPD unit over to Fergie's shop. Upon entering, he tells Rusty, Fergie's bodyguard, that something's gone wrong, then puts his pistol to the side of Rusty's head and blows his head off. He then seeks out Fergie, who begins shooting at him with a pistol. After an exchange of fire, Fergie falls, badly wounded. Doug walks up to Fergie, puts his pistol to Fergie's testicles, and asks him, ""Remember, who clipped your nuts for ya?"" The screen cuts to black with the sound of a gunshot.He calls Claire and asks her to come away with him, but he is watching from a house nearby and can see the FBI are in the same room with her. Claire, at first, tells him to come to the room to pick her up then Doug says he will come to the back door in an hour, Claire says she wants to meet him as it will be just like one of her sunny days, a reference to an earlier conversation when she said her brother died on a sunny day, meaning it's a coded message to warn him that the FBI are there. Doug puts on an MBTA bus driver's uniform, makes his way to an Amtrak station, and boards a train heading south. Frawley waits with his men, but knows Doug isn't going to show up. As Frawley is leaving, he figures out the code phrase that Claire used to warn Doug away, and tells her that he has jurisdiction all around the country to pursue Doug wherever he flees. Frawley returns to his car to find a note from Doug tucked under the windshield: ""Go fuck yourself.""Later, Claire finds a bag buried in a community garden which she tends. The bag contains money, a tangerine and a note that ends with ""I'll see you again, on this side or the other."" Claire uses the money to finance the renovation of a local hockey rink, and dedicates it to Doug's mother."

As his brothers Garsiv and Tus plan battle strategies, a spy sends word that the Holy City of Alamut has been supplying weapons to enemies of Persia. Taking matters into his own hands, Tus orders an attack on the sacred city and upon its fall Dastan encounters the beautiful Princess Tamina. When King Sharaman dies under mysterious circumstances shortly after, and Dastan is accused of his murder, he flees with the princess on a harrowing mission to clear his name. Learning from Tamina the true motives behind Alamut's invasion, Dastan must embark on a perilous quest to stop an evil mastermind's plot for ultimate power with a mystical weapon that can control the very fabric of time.—The Massie Twins In Persia, in the Royal City of Nasaf, the fair King Sharaman rules the empire with his brother Nizan. Sharaman has two sons, but adopts the orphan Dastan that becomes part of his family. Years later, the Holy City of Alamut ruled by Princess Tamina is under siege of the troops led by Tus, Garsiv and Dastan, after their uncle Nizan had intercepted a spy carrying weapons for Alamut. Dastan invades the city with his men to avoid a massacre and the Persian army conquers the city. Dastan gets a dagger from an enemy and King Sharaman comes to Almut very upset with the invasion of the holy city. Then he arranges the marriage of Dastan with Princess Tamina. When Dastan gives a holy cloak delivered by Tus to his father, the mantle is poisoned and kills Sharaman. Dastan is accused of betrayal but he escapes with Princess Ttamina.

Dastan is soon on the run however when his gift to the King poisons him, putting Nizam on the throne. Tamina tells him the importance of the dagger - it can transport the bearer back in time. With his new found weapon, Dastan sets out to change past events and learn the identity of the man who betrayed them and killed his adopted father.—garykmcd The plot follows Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), a street urchin in Persia, historically in the Persian Empire in the sixth century. After showing courage in the market place, he is adopted by the king. Fifteen years later, Dastan, and his royal blooded foster brothers Garsiv and Tus lead the Persian army in an attack on the sacred city of Alamut, under the assumption that the city's people are selling weapons to their enemies, as shown by Nizam (Ben Kingsley), the King's brother and adviser. As Garsiv leads the initial assault, Dastan decides to lead a surprise attack with his friend Bis (Reece Ritchie) against the orders of his brother. He manages to open the eastern gate of Alamut and prevents further casualties. During the fight in the city, Dastan defeats one of Princess Tamina's (Gemma Arterton) guards who was in the possession of the mythical Dagger of Time. The dagger gives its owner the ability to go back in time for a short period so that the user can try to correct any mistake or redo any moment. Alamut falls to the Persians, Tamina is captured and is offered as a wife for Tus, which would make the city of Alamut a part of the Persian Empire.The Persians celebrate their victory, but during the celebration Prince Dastan is fooled into presenting a poisoned gown seemingly given to him by Tus to King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), which fatally burns the king. Prince Dastan is held as the perpetrator of his father's murder. He escapes the castle with Princess Tamina while Bis, his best friend, is killed trying to save them. Together, they embark on a journey the Prince wants to prove his innocence, while Tamina wants to safeguard the Dagger of Time. On the first night, Tamina attempts to kill the prince and recover the dagger, but Dastan accidentally activates the dagger and learns about its ability to rewind time for one minute and in doing so, prevents Tamina from attacking. Dastan believes that Tus knew about the dagger and framed Dastan for their father's murder in an attempt to seize the throne and the dagger, thus becoming the most powerful ruler of Persia.During their journey, the duo meets a group of merchant-bandits, in the valley of slaves, including entrepreneur and ostrich racing-organizer Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina) with his friend Seso (Steve Toussaint) who hails from the Ngbaka, masters of the throwing knives. Dastan offers Tamina up as a slave in return for their hospitality. However, the bandits try to take the Dagger of Time and take Dastan to the newly crowned Tus because of the reward for his capture; they fail in the process, while the two escape.Dastan and Tamina return to Persia for King Sharaman's funeral. Dastan tries to convince his uncle Nizam that he was not the cause of his father's death, only to discover the dagger was taken by Tamina. Instead, he notices the burns on Nizam's hands, which indicate he was the one who set up the murder of the King. Furthermore, Nizam has set up an ambush for Dastan along the Persian streets, and after a conflict with his brother Garsiv, Dastan escapes.Meanwhile, back in Persia, Nizam, aware that Dastan knows he was responsible, tries to convince the newly-crowned King Tus and Garsiv that Dastan is trying to overthrow them and must be killed without a trial to avoid a rebellion. When this fails, Nizam hires the Hassansins, a group of highly-skilled warriors who once served as hired killers for Persian royalty. Nizam had kept the sect hidden for his own ends after Sharaman had them disbanded.Dastan catches up with Tamina and explains that the villainous brother of the King, Nizam was behind it all. The attack of Alamut was based on false allegations provided by Nizam and promoted with a motive to attain the Dagger of Time and use it with the massive Sandglass, which is hidden under the city of Alamut. This way, Nizam would go back in time before he had saved Sharaman from being attacked by a lion and undo the act, hence ensure that he becomes the King of Persia. However, Tamina reveals that the Sandglass is the vessel holding the Sands of Time, which the Gods conjured to punish humanity for its sins. A pure hearted girl, offering her life, convinced them to seal the sands; should the Dagger of Time be used to pierce the Sandglass, the sands would be released and destroy the entire world. The holder of the dagger may also turn back time as far as they please. The pair then put aside their differences and agree to work together to protect the dagger.Dastan and Tamina are again captured by Sheik Amar, Seso, and their group because of the chaos they caused back at the valley. Sheik intends to claim the reward for turning them in to renew his business. But that night, when everyone is asleep, the Hassansin leader (Gísli Örn Garðarsson) attacks the group in an oasis by controlling a number of vipers. Many of the group die, but Dastan uses the dagger to rewind time, and, foreseeing the attack, manages to kill all the snakes single-handedly, saving Seso in the process. The Hassansin leader then leaves in a sand dervish.The next day, the pair, now accompanied by Sheik and Seso, travel to the secret sanctuary in the mountains near India, where it's possible to seal the dagger by returning it to the stone where it came from. In order to do so, Tamina would have to sacrifice herself, but it fails as they run into Garsiv's men. Dastan, however, manages to persuade his brother that he is innocent, only for Garsiv to be killed by a flurry of spike-knives thrown by a Hassansin. The Hassanin attack, killing many of the group, while their leader manages to snatch the Dagger of Time from Tamina (who was knocked unconscious in the battle) by using a trained snake. However, Dastan is saved from the last Hassansin by Garsiv, who then succumbs to his injuries.Tamina and Dastan, as well as Sheik Amar and Seso, return to Alamut to reveal the truth about Nizam and the dagger to Tus. First, they must get the dagger, which is kept in the sacred temple, guarded by the Hassansin who killed Garsiv. Seso, the master of throwing knives, fights the spike-wielding Hassansin to obtain the dagger. He manages to kill the Hassansin after a well aimed throw, yet is fatally wounded in the process. Seso manages to throw the Dagger out of the window to Sheik and Dastan before dying. Sheik Amar then distracts the guards by serving as a decoy while Dastan shows the truth about the Dagger to his brother Tus by killing himself, only to have Tus rewind time with the dagger. Afterward, Tus is killed by Nizam, and Dastan is incapacitated by another Hassasin. The Dagger is once again in Nizam's hands, but Dastan manages to defeat the Hassasin with Tamina's help. She realises that the Hassansin had been a spy inside the city of Alamut and must have been the one who told Nizam about the Dagger.Nizam goes to the Sandglass caves beneath Alamut, as Dastan and Tamina race to stop him. Tamina opens a secret gate leading to the chamber, allowing them to take a short cut to the Sandglass. En route, they encounter the leader of the Hassansins; however, after a close fight, Dastan gets the upper hand and stabs the Hassansin before throwing him into the chasm. Dastan and Tamina then kiss. They then manage to reach Nizam as he pierces the Sandglass with the Dagger. During the final confrontation, Nizam knocks Tamina over the edge of the chasm and Dastan desperately catches her hand. Knowing he cannot stop Nizam and save her, Tamina professes her love for Dastan and lets go, sacrificing herself to stop Nizam. Dastan fights Nizam as they both hold their hands on the Dagger. Dastan then uses the Dagger's button to open the Sands of Time container and use its power against Nizam. The Sandglass slowly cracks and the sandstorm is shown destroying Alamut. Dastan is then able to use the Dagger and turn back the time as the Sandglass breaks, ending up at the point when he first held the Dagger during the siege of Alamut.Dastan uses his knowledge to reveal Nizam's evil plan to his brothers, gaining their acceptance by revealing what Tus told him about the meeting with their father prior to the attack. Exposed, Nizam attempts to kill Dastan but ends up dying by Tus' blade. After apologizing for the ransacking of her city, Tus suggests that perhaps Tamina should become Dastan's wife as a sign of good will. The Prince returns the Dagger of Time to her as a gift, as she looks at him surprised. The two of them are next shown talking to each other and Tamina expressing her surprise about Dastan's sudden change in behavior and hinting that he may have discovered something to which he replies that they are in control of their own destiny."
RED,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1245526/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When his peaceful life is threatened by a high-tech assassin, former black-ops agent Frank Moses reassembles his old team in a last-ditch effort to survive and uncover his assailants. Frank (Bruce Willis) is retired, bored, and lonely living off of his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life is his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker, Sarah (Mary-Louis Parker). Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces him back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into his past and the people with whom he used to work. Like Frank they are all ""R.E.D."" - Retired Extremely Dangerous.—Malcolm is Crazy Former C.I.A. Agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) adjusts himself to retirement and even decorates his house for Christmas. He keeps on tearing up his checks as an excuse to keep on conversing with Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), a Pension Department employee. Then one day, his residence is attacked by heavily-armed, masked assailants. He escapes, but his house is destroyed. He meets with Sarah, abducts her, and convinces her that she in danger. He seeks the assistance of the Russians, and breaks-in to the C.I.A. headquarters and finds his file is tagged as ""R.E.D."" (Retired Extremely Dangerous). He contacts his former associates: Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich), and Victoria (Helen Mirren), who join him with a plan that will pit them against security forces, especially when he announces their agenda is to kill Vice President Robert Stanton (Julian McMahon). But then things get complicated after Sarah is apprehended and held for interrogation.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) used to be a C.I.A. top Agent, but now that he is retired, the secrets he knows make him a C.I.A. target. He unites with ex-Agents Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich), and Victoria (Dame Helen Mirren) to use all of their abilities to stay alive and stop the operation. They are labelled ""R.E.D."": Retired Extremely Dangerous, so an impossible mission is just another day at work.—ahmetkozan Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) lives a very routine life alone in the Cleveland suburb of Parma Heights, Ohio. He wakes up early (6 a.m. on the dot on the morning we meet him, with no alarm), exercises, and retrieves his mail. Upon receiving a government pension check in the mail, he calls the pension office to speak to his case worker, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). He tells her the check didn't arrive as he tears it up. She's exasperated and promises that they'll send another check right away. It's evident that Frank calls just to speak with her, and she enjoys talking to him too. They chat about things like the book she's reading (it's a trashy romance called Love's Savage Secret -- ""It's terrible -- I love it"") and how many leaves are growing on Frank's avocado pit.Christmas is approaching and Frank decides to follow his neighbors' example and decorate his property, putting a team of reindeer on the lawn and a snowman on the porch. It's not clear whether he does it because he's really feeling it or to make his already nondescript house blend into a neighborhood where everyone else has Christmas decorations.One day on the phone with Sarah, Frank plucks up the courage to say that he'll be in Kansas City the following week, where she lives. She tells him to call her when he gets there. Later, they're in their separate homes reading in bed -- and they're both reading Love's Savage Secret.In the middle of the night, Frank wakes up, dons his robe, and wanders sleepily downstairs. As he turns a corner towards the kitchen, three men wearing SWAT gear follow silently behind him. They watch as he enters the kitchen and closes the door. With the go-ahead, one man kicks the door in but finds the kitchen empty. As they look for him, Frank suddenly appears and takes them all out one by one with silent precision. When their radio asks for a report from Unit 1, Frank realizes there must be more assassins outside. He takes a handful of bullets, puts them in a frying pan with a little oil, and turns on the stove. He goes into the basement and sledgehammers through the floor to a hidden depository where a packed bag, money, weapons and ammunition, and passports are stored. Upstairs, the bullets cook off, giving the impression of a gunfight, and a second team of three operatives opens fire on Frank's house with automatic rifles. They enter the house but Frank quickly kills all three of them. He walks away from his house unscathed as his front porch collapses.Sarah returns home from a bad date, muttering about the man's not-so-ideal qualities. ""And you live with your mother? Awesome!"" she says to herself as she grabs a beer from the fridge and walks into her livingroom... right past Frank, who's standing in her hallway. He tentatively waves at her and smiles but she begins throwing things at him and demands that he leave. She interrupts herself to ask ""Is that my bag?"" (He admits that it is, and he packed it), and ""Did you vacuum?"" (He did, a little.) He tries to calmly tell her, with no success, that someone is trying to kill him and that they will have been listening in on his calls, thereby knowing who Sarah is and where she lives. As if on cue, a black SUV full of operatives arrives outside. Frank apologizes to Sarah and takes her with him just before the assassins break into her apartment. As he drives, Frank tries to smooth things over with Sarah, who is tied and gagged with duct tape in the back seat. She mumbles and rants unintelligibly behind the tape and gives Frank looks of disgust.In a modern house with lots of glass, a guy (Karl Urban) in a nice black suit talks to his wife (Michelle Nolden) on a Bluetooth headset about a bullying problem their son is having at school. As he talks, he takes hair from a bag and carefully places some on a hairbrush and some in a shower drain, then plants a fingerprint. He goes through some photos before promising to pick up milk on the way home. As he hangs up, he approaches a man who's standing on a chair wearing a noose. The guy in the suit pulls the duct tape from the second man's mouth. The second man says ""I can make you rich! Do you know who I am?""
""Of course I do,"" suit guy replies. He kicks the chair out from under his victim, who kicks and struggles briefly. As soon as he stops, suit guy removes the dead man's handcuffs. Ten minutes later, suit guy is picked up in a limo in D.C. by his boss, Cynthia Wilkes (nm068207), and assigned to kill Frank, who's described as a retired CIA analyst.Frank drives through the early hours of the morning to a motel in New Orleans. Frank leaves Sarah tied to the bed, apologizes once more, comments on her beautiful eyes (which she rolls at him), and leaves, telling her he'll be back soon. He goes to meet one of his oldest friends, a fellow retiree living in Green Springs Rest Home. Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), dressed in a red track suit, asks a young aide, Marna (Jaqueline Fleming), to fix the television reception for him but fixes his attention on her rear end as she bends over. Frank enters the room and greets Joe, telling him in private about his visit from the ""wet team."" When Joe asks if Frank ID'd any of them, Frank says ""Kind of,"" and hands Joe a manila envelope full of severed fingers.In a small jet, suit guy peruses papers, some of which are torn or crumpled. He puzzles over the torn half of a pension check until he finds the other half: he's looking at Frank's recycling. A little later, he finds his way to Sarah's records, criticizes someone over the phone for not being suspicious of Frank's 22 calls to her in pension services, and realizes that Sarah has just called 911. He arranges for someone to pick Sarah up in New Orleans and tells his pilot to change course.Joe makes a call and tells Frank a hit squad from South Africa apparently the same one that came after him -- killed a New York Times reporter called Stephanie Chan. They don't know who she is, but there's some connection to Frank's case. Joe is bored, 80 years old and has stage 4 liver cancer. He reminisces about the things they've been through and admits he never thought about getting old and the perils involved with it.Meanwhile, Sarah has managed to escape from her bonds by slamming the headboard of the bed against the wall. She calls 911 and is soon met by police and an ambulance. The paramedics dismiss her and she's led away by an officer who tells her that the police need her to make a statement and a couple of Feds also want to ask her some questions. When she asks to retrieve her purse from the motel room, the officer grabs her forcefully and begins to inject her with a drug. However, the officer is swiftly killed or incapacitated by Frank, who got back just in time. He commandeers the police car and drives away with Sarah, who begins to slip into a drugged stupor. Their car is T-boned by a black SUV. Frank is out of the car and shooting at the SUV before the car even stops spinning. The SUV driver is none other than suit guy, a CIA assassin called William Cooper. Cooper is a force to be reckoned with, but severely underestimates Frank's ingenuity. Frank calls 911 to report an officer down and fingers Cooper as the suspect. As Frank escapes the city with Sarah, Cooper is surrounded by police.Frank and Sarah drive to New York City to follow up on the reporter's death. Sarah becomes more trusting of Frank and accepts that he is ex-CIA. They find the reporter's mother living in Chinatown and Sarah asks to speak with her, believing she'll be able to gain the womans trust better than Frank could. Mrs. Chan (Emily Kuroda) tells them that her daughter was murdered in what was described as a robbery gone bad, but nothing was taken from her apartment. Mrs. Chan shows them a postcard from Stephanie that arrived the day she was killed. On it, Frank reads a series of numbers that no one had been able to decode. Frank asks where Chan's daughter went to college and follows that lead to the school's library stacks. He reveals to Sarah that the numbers on the postcard are from a library classification system and indicate the location of a book. The lead takes them to a section of the library where Sarah finds the book containing a piece of paper with a list of names on it. As they check the names, Frank realizes that most of the people on the list have recently been killed.Joe sits quietly in his room and is approached from behind by an assailant (Lawrence Turner), who Joe can see in the mirror. Joe asks if ""this is how it's going to be."" Frank attempts to contact Joe but his persistence is finally greeted with the saddened voice of nurse Mary (Justine Wachsberger) as she stands outside the retirement home near an ambulance. Deflated by the news, Frank tells Sarah that there is still another person who can help them.Cooper, meanwhile, goes to the records room of the CIA where the records keeper, Henry (Ernest Borgnine), provides some background on Frank. A retired black-ops agent (not an analyst as Cooper was told), Frank served in the CIA doing a variety of work and is an expert in practically every known kind of spycraft, weaponry, and combat. Labeled ""RED"" (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) after his retirement, Frank is a top ex-agent. However, it's clear that Cooper is also in the top rank. As an assassin working for the CIA, he has access to top secret information and is highly skilled in his profession.Frank and Sarah drive to Pensacola, Florida and steal a boat to travel to a dilapidated house on a bayou. Frank advises Sarah to stay close and not make any sudden moves. They're accosted by a wild-looking man dressed in camouflage and armed with a crossbow. Frank tells his old peer, Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), that he's not there to kill him despite Marvin's paranoia. Satisfied, Marvin takes them into his home...a beat up car out back with a secret stairwell descending from inside the hood of the car; he explains that the house is a decoy. When questioned by Sarah about Marvin's paranoid behaviors, Frank tells her that Marvin suspected correctly that he was part of a mind control program when serving the CIA. He was given daily doses of LSD for eleven years. Frank briefs Marvin on his assassination attempt and their findings, showing him the list of names. Marvin recognizes most of the names as people who were involved in a mission in 1981 in Guatemala, a mission that Marvin and Frank were also a part of. Marvin recalls the clean-up they had to do in a village there after most of the inhabitants were massacred and theorizes that all the people involved are now being silenced.However, one person on the list remains alive. Gabriel Singer (James Remar) now works as a cargo pilot. When they stop for lunch, Sarah works the phone and discovers Singer is flying into Mobile the next day. Marvin is distracted by a passing helicopter and notes its ID number. The next day as they prepare to leave for Mobile, Marvin becomes excited and exclaims that he's ""going to get the pig!"" They arrive in Mobile by train, Marvin holding a stuffed, pink pig beneath his arm, and walk through the train station only to see Marvin grab a woman in a business suit and threaten her with a gun, demanding to know who she works for and saying ""You smell like Washington."" He tells the bewildered Frank that the woman was following them, she has a camera in her bag, and she's ""one of them."" Frank empties the woman's purse and finds no camera, so he orders Marvin to let her go and go rent a car. Marvin is embarrassed and dejected by his failure.At the airport, they find Singer and inquire about the Guatemala mission. Under pressure, Singer takes them to the privacy of a traffic control tower and tells them that the purpose of their mission was to extract a person of interest from the village and erase all evidence of his involvement there. Before he can say anything else, Marvin notices a helicopter flying toward the tower. Nobody else finds this noteworthy they are, as Sarah observes, at an airport but Marvin panics because it's the same helicopter he saw yesterday at lunch in Pensacola. Before they can do anything, a sharpshooter in the helicopter kills Singer. Cooper orders them to ""shake the tree,"" so they keep shooting, destroying the tower.The trio manages to escape and takes refuge among large shipping containers stored near the terminal. They're attacked by multiple assassins as they dodge among the containers. Marvin gives Frank his pig, which turns out to house a folded grenade launcher. The woman Marvin accosted earlier shoots at them (just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you). She calls Marvin an old man, which makes him indignant. ""Can I kill her now?"" Frank's all for it. When the woman takes aim with a rocket launcher Marvin takes his revenge, firing a bullet into the oncoming rocket (an amazing feat), which triggers a premature explosion, killing the assailant. They continue to fight their way out of the terminal before Cooper and his men can kill them. In the aftermath, Frank determines that they need more information and must infiltrate the CIA itself to obtain it. Marvin slanders this as a suicide mission but Frank knows where to go to get some help. This news doesn't improve Marvin's morale.They drive to Russian Federation headquarters and Frank enters alone. He is escorted to a large basement room where he meets Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox), an old secret agent and long-time adversary whose cousin Frank killed. They share some vodka and Frank reveals, to Ivan's amusement, that his cousin Igor is still alive -- Frank turned him. Igor owns a string of 7-Elevens and weighs 500 pounds. Ivan laments that he's bored and hasn't killed anyone in years. He agrees to help Frank and give him the blueprints, credentials, and tools he needs to infiltrate the CIA in Langley on condition that Frank perform a favor to be named later. Frank and Sarah enter the CIA with fake IDs, courtesy of Ivan, and are nearly caught when Sarah drops Frank's contact lens (with false optics for an eye scanner). They find their way down to the records room where Henry recognizes Frank and eagerly gives him the file on Guatemala. He tells Frank that Cooper was down in the room looking for information on him the other day. Frank sends Sarah off to wait for him while he goes to confront Cooper in his office. The two fight fiercely, both getting injured in the process. After gaining an early advantage, Cooper mockingly calls Frank ""Grandpa"" which turns out to be true, in a professional sense: Frank trained Kordesky, the agent who trained Cooper. Frank asserts that he is far better skilled than Cooper and that he won't back down easily before escaping, but not before getting shot in the shoulder. He reunites with Sarah and they improvise a bomb in a maintenance closet using acetone, bleach, and Clog Buster. They pull the fire alarm and slip out with the evacuating crowd. Frank steals a fireman's helmet and jacket to escape and he and Sarah return to Marvin, who has taken an ambulance.Inside, they find Joe, alive and well and eager to join the team. Joe reveals that he faked his death after an assassin arrived at the retirement home to kill him. Joe was prepared and killed the assassin with a hidden gun and silencer.Meanwhile, Cooper recuperates in his office from his scuffle with Frank. His superior, Cynthia Wilkes, berates him for having his ass handed to him by a retiree. She tells him nothing in the mission has changed (i.e. he still needs to kill Frank).The team drives to the home of Victoria (Helen Mirren), a fellow wetwork retiree. They're nervous about going there, but Frank still has a bullet in his shoulder and they can't go to a hospital. Frank enters the house alone and finds Victoria arranging flowers in her living room. She greets Frank as an old friend and immediately takes note of his wounds. She agrees to help him, provided that Marvin (who's hiding in a bush outside the window behind her, aiming a rifle at her) stand down ""before he hurts himself."" As she stitches Frank up, she admits that she too misses the old life and even takes the odd job on the side every once in a while. She is thrilled to meet Sarah and, with the others, goes over all the information they've collected.The review reveals that one man is on the deceased reporter's list but not in the Guatemala file taken from the CIA records department: arms dealer Alexander Dunning (Richard Dreyfuss). Dunning lives secluded and well-guarded in his mansion, but is happy to invite Joe to meet with him because Joe is posing as the defense minister of an African dictatorship in need of weaponry. Marvin and Frank act as his bodyguards. Dunning, under audio surveillance by the FBI due to his history of arms merchandising, activates a prerecorded speech about his services before leading them into a sound-proof study. Sarah and Victoria wait outdoors, hidden in the woods and keeping watch with a sniper rifle. Victoria tells Sarah that she's never seen Frank so happy and, if Sarah breaks his heart, she will kill her and hide her body in the woods. Victoria also tells Sarah that when she was in MI6, she was in love with a fellow agent but that their relationship wasn't ""sanctioned."" When Victoria's loyalty was brought into question, she was ordered to kill her lover... so she put three bullets into his chest.Frank, Joe, and Marvin reveal themselves to Dunning and secure him in a chair with duct tape. Dunning confesses, under threat of torture, that the person extracted from the village in Guatemala was none other than Vice President Robert Stanton (Julian McMahon), who was a lieutenant at the time. Apparently, he suffered a breakdown and went AWOL, killing everyone in the village. Now that he's about to run for president, Stanton has ordered hits on everyone who was involved in cleaning up his mess in order to tie up loose ends, using the CIA as his personal hit squad. Dunning believes he'll be targeted too. At that moment, the recording in the house begins to skip and the surveillance team outside sends the order to surround the house. Victoria relays this message via radio to Frank. He realizes that there's no clean way out of the house and Joe proposes a plan, one that will sacrifice himself but ensure the escape of the others. Cooper, following a tip from Cynthia, arrives on the scene and calls in to negotiate the peaceful surrender of Frank, who responds that he is simply uncovering a scandal involving the cover-up of the vice president's treachery. This news shakes Cooper's faith in his mission, but he remains firm in his demands. Frank agrees to come out while Cooper orders his men to hold their fire.Frank walks out the front door in a trench coat and hat. No sooner does he cross the threshold than he's shot down by an unseen sniper. Cooper runs to the body, followed closely by Victoria's sights, and discovers that ""Frank"" is really Joe in disguise but of course, he's dead. Victoria fires on Cooper, intentionally missing, giving Frank and Marvin time to escape out a window and into the woods. However, Sarah trips on a snow-covered incline and Victoria is forced to leave her behind to be captured. When Ivan picks up Frank, Marvin, and Victoria, Frank is surprised to find that Victoria and Ivan know each other and startled by something Ivan says to Victoria (possibly in Russian): ""Did he just call you bunny?""Frank resolves to save Sarah and calls Cooper just as an interrogator begins to question her, telling Sarah that nobody knows she's there, so he can do anything he needs to do to make her talk. Frank's call is already being traced before the tech hands the phone to Cooper. Frank tells Cooper that they all must protect the things they love. Cooper is horrified to find out that Frank is calling from his own home, watching his wife and children (Jake GoodmanandTess Goodman) play outside. Frank tells him that he will rip his family from him and then kill him if anything happens to Sarah. Cooper promises to keep her safe. Before he hangs up, Frank confesses his plan to kill the vice president for his past misdeeds and for ordering the hits on them. A squad rushes to Cooper's house and, when he arrives, he finds his family perfectly safe. On a table inside, he sees that Frank left him the Guatemala file and the CIA ID he'd previously stolen from Cooper.The team regroups and Ivan joins the fray. He relates the turmoils of love to Frank and reveals that the love of his life shot him three times in the chest to save them both; that when he woke up alive, he knew she still loved him. He tells Frank not to worry about Sarah.They formulate a plan to get Sarah back and to expose the vice president for what he did. They go to Chicago where Stanton is holding a fundraiser. It's a black tie event and security is high but the team manages to gain access with minimal effort. Victoria attends the gala in an elegant white gown while Marvin sneaks in as a waiter. Stanton arrives with his Secret Service detail (to which Cooper has been seconded) and addresses the attendees with thanks and the formal announcement that he is to run for president, asking them to give him their monetary consideration for his campaign. The music plays and people begin to dance. Ivan approaches Victoria and invites her to dance with him as he confesses his love for her. Victoria plays it off, trying to keep cool and, as the dance ends, hands Ivan a spray canister from her purse. Ivan walks away, spraying the smelly contents of the canister throughout the room.Victoria leaves the ballroom and uses her heavy necklace to chain the double doors shut behind her from the outside. At that moment, Ivan begins shouting that he smells gas, causing a panic and the evacuation of the VP. With the fire alarms blaring, people screaming, and the main doors locked (courtesy of Victoria) the Secret Service is forced to move Stanton through an alternate exit into the parking garage. They load Stanton into a limo but come quickly under machine gun fire by Victoria and Marvin. When they attempt to load Stanton into a backup limo, Ivan emerges from an elevator on cue and detonates a bomb, destroying the second limo. Cooper, meanwhile, catches up to the Secret Service and cuts through the gunfire towards the machine gun. He finds the station empty; the gun is being fired automatically by a leverage system. He pulls the cord, allowing the secret service to move Stanton back inside through another ext. They run through the kitchens but are confronted by Victoria and Marvin once again, who continue to fire at them. The Secret Service agents return fire and Victoria is wounded in the hip. She and Marvin try to escape but, in pain, Victoria is unable to move fast enough and she tells Marvin to go on alone. He takes off without arguing the point. She runs to the end of the kitchen where the exit is blocked off by a grate. Unable to open it, she backs into it and prepares herself for her fate as the Secret Service agents draw closer. Ivan appears behind her and opens the gate before taking her in his arms and carrying her away. She tells him she loves him.Meanwhile, Stanton is escorted out of the building, where he and his two remaining guards have a weird standoff with Marvin, who runs at them wearing explosives. They run the run other way and jump into another limo marked the vice-presidential seal. Cooper chases after them and demands that the limo stop, but Stanton orders the driver to keep driving. The driver is actually Frank. He turns around and tasers his passengers, leaving the Secret Service agents on the side of the road and taking Stanton hostage. Early the next morning, Frank contacts Cooper and arranges a trade: Stanton for Sarah.At the designated spot, the Evanston power plant, Frank and Stanton watch the others arrive: first a limo backed up by a small truck with a large man and a large gun in back, then Cooper on his own. Cynthia and some bodyguards climb out of the limo, followed by Sarah and Alexander Dunning. Nearly in tears, Stanton says that Dunning, not Stanton, ordered the killings. Stanton is willing to expose everything; he just wants it to be over.
Dunning confesses that he is actually the mastermind behind all the hits and has been working closely with the CIA and Cynthia to ensure that it gets done; he's been using Cooper and the CIA to kill all the loose ends, while Stanton is simply a pawn. Dunning demands Frank's gun in exchange for Sarahs release. Sarah shakes her head no. Frank says ""I tore up all those checks I just wanted to talk to you."" He drops his gun.Dunning orders Cooper to handcuff Frank and Cooper, in an act of faith, does so but places the key in Frank's hand. Dunning tells Cooper to kill Frank and Sarah, and he'll be head of the CIA. Cooper considers the offer and Cynthia, her gun to Sarah's head, says ""This is going to happen either way."" Cooper says ""Fuck you, Cynthia,"" and shoots her down as Frank strolls towards Dunning and crushes his windpipe. Dunning's bodyguards, before they have time to react, are gunned down by the hiding Victoria, Ivan, and Marvin. Cooper, realizing the scale of the scandal, agrees to take care of the mess and promises to let Frank go. He calls Frank Grandpa again. Cooper and Frank shake hands and Frank, always scrupulous, returns the handcuffs. Marvin satisfies his paranoid tendencies by shooting Dunning in the head. He asks if they want to get pancakes.Driving out together, Ivan reminds Frank that he owes him a favor; a minor, nuclear thing in Moldova. Sarah asks if they can go (she's getting very into this secret agent stuff) and Frank agrees before kissing her.The final scene shows Frank wheeling Marvin, dressed as a woman and carrying a stolen nuclear warhead in his lap, in a wheelbarrow somewhere in the fields of Moldova being chased by the Moldovan army. Marvin asks Frank why his girlfriend couldn't be the one to wear the dress as mortars explode around them."
Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814255/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A teenager discovers he's the descendant of a Greek god and sets out on an adventure to settle an on-going battle between the gods. Percy Jackson, like any teenager, has issues: on top of having ADHD, he also has to cope with an abusive stepfather and dysfunctional home life. When he realises that he is a demigod and his biological father is Poseidon, the sea god, he sets out to prevent all-out war between the Olympians after the lightning bolt of Zeus is stolen, and he is framed for it.—Tom Daly Accused of stealing Zeus's powerful lightning bolt, Poseidon's son faces the threat of an all-out war among gods unless he returns the destructive weapon within two weeks. In the meantime, as war brews over Mount Olympus, unusual teenager Percy Jackson finds himself caught between two worlds, struggling to understand. But can a mere mortal prevent the impending battle, retrieve the bolt, and find the audacious lightning thief before the ancient deities destroy the Earth?—Nick Riganas It's the 21st century, but the gods of Mount Olympus and assorted monsters have walked out of the pages of high school student Percy Jackson's Greek mythology texts and into his life. And they're not happy: Zeus's lightning bolt has been stolen. As Percy finds himself caught between angry and battling gods, he and his friends embark on a cross-country adventure to catch the true lightning thief and unravel a mystery more powerful than the gods themselves.—20th Century Fox The movie begins with the camera panning over New York City, past Coney Island and along a pier. Water rises from Brighton Beach and coalesces into the form of a huge being looking like a man-- the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd). Poseidon strides through the water along the pier, glancing nonchalantly at a gawking fisherman, and steps onto the streets of New York, shrinking to human size and his garments changing to resemble normal contemporary attire. He arrives at the observation deck of the Empire State building and meets another man there, similarly attired-- his brother Zeus (Sean Bean), king of the Greek gods. Zeus asks Poseidon to look to the sky. Poseidon notes heavy thunderclouds, and Zeus points out there is no lightning-- his master bolt, which gives him control over lightning, has been stolen. Zeus gets directly into Poseidon's face and tells him that he is convinced that Poseidon's son is responsible for the theft. Poseidon insists that his son doesn't know who he is, and warns Zeus about crossing a line, and that if Zeus harms Poseidon's son, he will be in for the fight of his life, but Zeus does not back down. He tells Poseidon that unless the bolt is returned to him by midnight on June 21st, the summer solstice, there will be war.We then see young teenager Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) sitting calmly at the bottom of a swimming pool. On surfacing, he is told by his best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) that he had been underwater nearly seven minutes. Hardly possible for most people, Percy thinks little of it. Being under water helps clear his mind and is one of the few places he can think.Percy and Grover are at school at the Yancy Academy, and we see that Grover uses crutches. They walk through the halls, disgusted as several students fight openly in the halls before it is broken up by faculty. In class, there is a substitute teacher, Mrs. Dodds (Maria Olsen), writing a quote from Othello on the blackboard. She asks the class if anyone can explain the quote. Several students raise their hands, but Mrs. Dodds notices Percy glancing away and calls on him. He looks at the blackboard, blinking as the letters seem to twist and dance around confusingly in front of his eyes. Finally he says he doesn't know the answer.Percy arrives home, kissing his mother, Sally (Catherine Keener), hello. She asks him about school and he is clearly very frustrated. Percy suffers from both dyslexia and ADHD, impairing his school performance. He thought the Yancy Academy was supposed to make things better. Sally tries to assure him that one day, everything will make sense, but he is very dubious.At that moment the door opens and in walks Gabe Ugliano (Joe Pantoliano), Sally's husband and Percy's stepfather. Gabe is bald, paunchy, and dirty, with granny glasses attached to a chain around his neck. He sits at the table and asks where his beer is. Sally says it's in the fridge, but Gabe clearly expects her to bring it to him. Sally complies without a word of complaint, much to Percy's disgust. He insists that Gabe show some respect to Sally. Gabe gets up and leans against the wall close to Percy, and says that it's his house and Percy is the one who needs to show some respect.Gabe retreats to his room and Percy asks Sally why she stays with him. Gabe Ugliano is a crass, crude pig of a man with foul armpit stench, who cannot hold a steady job because of his demeanor and smell. Sally tries to insist that Gabe is good to her and Percy in 'ways he doesn't understand.' Percy can only say that Sally is right-- he doesn't understand.Percy is going with his school class to a museum to look at a gallery of ancient Greek and Roman exhibits. A voiceover from Poseidon tells Percy that everything as he knows it, is about to change. Percy glances around, and Poseidon is seen looking at him across the street, though Percy does not recognize him as he has never seen Poseidon before. A bus moves past Poseidon, in front of him, and he's gone.At a gallery showing sculptures of the Greek gods, a teacher named Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan) is lecturing on them. Mr. Brunner is in a motorized wheelchair, his legs covered in a blanket. Mr. Brunner explains how the gods often came down to Earth and had love affairs-- and sometimes children-- with mortals. He asks Percy if he can tell the class what these children were called. Percy correctly replies, 'demigods.' Mr. Brunner says that many of these demigods became great heroes, such as Hercules and Achilles. He then asks Percy to name another, giving him a hint: he has something in common with this hero.Percy happens to glance up at a wall mural above Mr. Brunner's head. The Ancient Greek writing seems to dance and twist around before Percy's eyes, and to his surprise, he can read it: Perseus. Percy realizes that his own name is similar to Perseus.As Mr. Brunner begins to explain the labors of Hercules and his victory over the Nemean lion, Mrs. Dodds quietly asks if she can speak to Percy alone, away from the other students. She opens a door into an adjacent, unfinished room, and enters behind Percy. But when he turns around, she is standing high up on a scaffolding.In a harsh, grating voice, Mrs. Dodds demands, ""Where is it?"" Percy is completely confused, and then confounded as Mrs. Dodds changes into a hideous winged beast with long fangs that swoops down and demands that Percy give her the lightning bolt he stole. Percy is horrified and with no idea as to what is going on. The creature swoops again and seizes Percy, lifting him high up in the air and threatening to bite his heart out unless he returns the stolen lightning bolt.Grover and Mr. Brunner burst into the room, The creature turns, recognizing Mr. Brunner, who demands that it release Percy or he'll tear the creature to pieces. The winged monster drops Percy and crashes through the window, flying off.Percy is sick with disbelief at what happened-- and then even more so as Mr. Brunner turns to Grover and curses himself for not having realized that a ""Fury"" was concealed in their school. He asks Percy what the Fury wanted from him, and he shrugs and says that she said something about him stealing a lightning bolt. Mr. Brunner says in a very worried tone, ""they found him,"" and Grover looks horrified, confusing Percy even further. Mr. Brunner tells Grover that Percy is no longer safe, and they should move him to ""the camp."" Percy confronts them on talking about him, right in front of him, without talking TO him. Mr. Brunner only hands Percy an object, telling him it is a powerful weapon and he should guard it well. Percy stares in amazement at what, to him, appears to be an ordinary writing pen. Mr. Brunner instructs Grover to bring Percy to Sally and not to take his eyes off of him. Grover nods and urges Percy to come with him. Neither Grover nor Mr. Brunner offer Percy any further answers, so for now he goes with Grover.Hurrying down the street, Grover warns Percy to simply keep walking and not to look at anyone. Percy demands to know why Mr. Brunner wanted Grover to watch Percy, and Grover only says that he is Percy's protector. He insists he is quite capable of doing this despite apparently being on crutches.At Percy's house, Gabe is playing poker with friends while Sally waits on them uncomplainingly. Percy comes in with Grover and urgently tells Sally they need to talk. Gabe crudely tells Percy to beat it, and Percy calls him a bald-headed freak. Gabe jumps up to hit Percy, but Grover slams a crutch down onto his foot and then hits him in the groin with it, which impresses Percy. Grover tells Sally that Percy has to leave immediately. Sally acquiesces and hurries out of the house with him.Driving across a bridge, Sally is no more straight with Percy than Grover or Mr. Brunner had been. She only tells him that she's bringing them to a ""camp for really special people."" She says it's about Percy's father-- his true father.As they drive on, Sally starts to tell Percy about how she met Percy's father... a man she never addresses by name. She says she was truly in love with him, and he loved her and Percy in turn. She admits that Percy's father left, but insists that he was forced to do it, and didn't abandon either of them.As they drive past a field with cows, one horned head rises up, looking much larger than the other cows' heads. Grover suddenly shouts urgently for Sally to watch out. She gapes in horror as the corpse of a cow is suddenly thrown into the road right in front of them. Sally loses control of the car and it flips over.The sound of heavy, ponderous footsteps begin to approach them. Percy stares as Grover removes his pants, revealing that his legs are those of a goat, complete with hooves. Grover uses them to smash through the car windshield so they can all get ouf of the car. The crutches, as he hurriedly says, are ""just for show--"" Grover can walk and run perfectly well, without them. The three of them flee from the approaching horror-- a huge bull-like humanoid. The monster picks up the car and hurls it at them.They arrive at a stone arch surrounded by torches, which Grover says is their destination. As Percy stares up at the arch, Greek lettering dances around before his eyes to form recognizable words: ""Camp Half Blood."" He and Grover dash through the arch... but Sally is unable to pass through; some kind of barrier repels her. She urgently tells Percy that she cannot pass through the gate because she is ""not like him."" Percy refuses to leave without her but Sally begs him to do so. Just then, the huge minotaur grabs Sally from behind, and Percy watches in horror as the monster holds her aloft in one hand. She begs him to run, saying he's safe inside the gate, but Percy insists on facing the monster down. Grover shouts for him to take out the pen Mr. Brunner gave him, and click it. Percy does so and is shocked to see it transform into a Greek sword. The minotaur squeezes Sally and she screams briefly before disappearing in a flash of smoke and gold-colored dust.Enraged, Percy charges at the minotaur, swinging the sword. The minotaur dodges and hurls a punch that blasts Percy into a tree. It charges at him on all fours, and he jumps away. One of the minotaur's horns lodges in the tree, and part of the horn breaks off when it tries to pull it loose. Percy grabs the broken-off horn as the minotaur charges again, and drives it into the monster's middle, killing it. Percy faints and collapses into Grover's arms.He awakens lying in a cot with Grover watching over him. Grover is now clad in a leather vest with a dagger sheathed at his hip. He tells Percy that he is in the camp infirmary and has been unconscious for three days. He asks what Percy remembers. Percy thinks he awoke from a crazy dream, but then glances down and sees Grover's goat-legs and hooves. Grover says that he is a satyr. Percy breaks down in misery realizing everything was real, and his mother is gone. Grover tries to comfort him, saying he feels responsible as it's his job to protect Percy, although he is just a junior protector and doesn't have his horns yet.Grover begins to take Percy around Camp Half Blood. People are seen in a mixture of modern and ancient Greek attire, and are training in combat with Greek weapons-- swords, shields, and bows. Grover finally begins to explain the truth about Percy, much to his continuing disbelief-- Percy is a demigod; one of hundreds throughout the world. Camp Half Blood is where demigods learn to harness their abilities, and while many go to lead ""normal lives,"" many go on to become great leaders and heroes, though Percy cannot see himself as a hero. Grover then explains Percy's dyslexia and ADHD-- written letters and words seem to twist and dance around before his eyes because his brain is hardwired to read ancient Greek, not modern English; like back at the museum when he was able to read the Greek writing. And his ADHD is his divine battle reflexes. He was never able to be still, and this is what allowed him to survive-- and prevail, in his battle with the minotaur. As Grover says, no ""loser"" (as Percy thinks of himself) can defeat one.Grover brings Percy to a field along a river where the students do most of their battle training. Percy stops and watches a beautiful young woman with long brunette hair battling several students at once-- and winning handily. She wields her sword with a grace and agility that Percy thinks he can only dream of. Percy asks Grover who she is, and he just laughs and warns him that the girl could tear him apart. But he says the girl's name is Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), and she is the daughter of Athena, goddess of wisdom. Still holding her sword at the throat of her last opponent, Annabeth happens to look in their direction, her expression unreadable as she look at Percy, almost as if recognizing him.Grover leads Percy to another field where he sees another amazing sight-- several centaurs engaged in a running exercise. But what's even more amazing is the lead centaur-- Mr. Brunner, or as he explains, here in this world, he is the legendary teacher, Chiron. He apologizes for hiding his true form, but he needed to keep an eye on Percy.As they continue through the camp, Grover is called to by a group of daughters of Aphrodite, goddess of love. Chiron smirks as Grover goes to join them, suggesting to Percy that he knows where it will lead. Chiron brings Percy into a house which he says is Percy's quarters at the camp. The house is filled with nautical objects, and includes a heavy trident. Picking up the trident, looking at it, Percy realizes that some of the walls are carved with a symbol resembling the trident. Understanding dawns on him-- Percy is the son of Poseidon, god of the sea. Chiron says this has been kept from Percy for all these years for his own safety-- for a child to be sired by one of the ""big three"" Greek gods (Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) is exceptionally rare, and as the son of Poseidon, Percy is one of the most powerful of the demigods, which makes him a threat to the Olympian gods. Chiron then explains that Sally knew all of this, and the reason she married Ugliano was that his foul armpit stench hid and masked the smell of Percy's blood from anything that the gods could have sent to eliminate him. Percy is quiet and thoughtful as he realizes how much Sally sacrificed for him-- why she tolerated Gabe's treatment of her so gracefully.Chiron then finally tells Percy about the reference to him as ""the lightning thief--"" Zeus' lightning bolt is the most powerful weapon ever created. Zeus' belief that Percy stole it centers aorund a very valid worry that it could pose a threat to Zeus' station as ruler of all the gods. Chiron warns Percy in a dire tone, that in ten days, if the bolt is not returned, the resulting war between Zeus and Poseidon would force all of Olympus to choose sides, and Earth would be torn asunder. Chiron plans to bring Percy to Olympus and make an appeal directly to Zeus as to Percy's innocence. As to why they can't go right now-- outside the gates are dangers; the Fury and the Minotaur being only the beginning. First, Percy needs to train so he will be able to handle these dangers.Grover and Percy are heading to the training field; Percy suited up properly in leather and mail armor and feeling very awkward in it. Chiron orders all the students to fall in and gather around him. He introduces Percy to all the other students and says he will need a team. Stepping forth to volunteer to take him, is Luke (Jake Abel), son of Hermes and camp leader. Luke is a bit cocky and a bit of a jokester but takes to Percy right off. He gives Percy a helmet and welcomes him to his team-- the Blue soldiers. Chiron then orders all the students to prepare for game of Capture the Flag-- Ancient Greek style.The two armies rush forth on command, swords and shields clashing. Luke tells Percy that he knows where the enemy flag is and to follow him. Ambushed by several Sons of Ares fighting for the red team, Luke and Percy fend them off, Percy amazed at having knocked out two of them. Luke urges Percy to hurry to the red flag while he holds off the rest of the Sons of Ares.Percy hurries to a stream, where he removes his helmet and kneels to take a drink. But before he sips the water, he looks up and sees the red flag, completely unguarded, just across the stream. Grabbing his sword, he rushes in delight over to the banner.But one red soldier is there to meet him-- Annabeth. The daughter of Athena quickly deals Percy several slash wounds and knocks him about the stream bank, seemingly toying with him. Chiron, Grover, Luke and a number of soldiers from both teams find their way there. Annabeth slashes Percy again and again, and kicks him down to the ground. The red soldiers cheer and gloat as she walks back to them.Suddenly Percy hears his father's voice telling him to go to the water, and it will give him power. Slowly, painfully, he crawls to the stream. Everyone turns and looks as he dips his hand into the water. Curiosity turns to surprise and then shock as the water flows up his arm and shoulder, and over his whole body, healing all his wounds. Percy climbs to his feet, surging with new power and strength, and makes a beeline for Annabeth, easily swatting aside all Red soldiers that try to stop him. Quickly the tip of his sword is at her throat, and she looks at him in amazement. Regaining her focus, Annabeth bats Percy's sword aside and they fight once again. But this time Percy matches her, strike for strike, parry for parry. They grapple at close quarters and Percy wrests her sword from her grip, putting its blade to the back of her neck, and the point of his own sword to her throat as Grover and Chiron clap excitedly.Annabeth surrenders, looking at Percy with a mixture of surprise at her defeat and admiration for the power he wields. He returns her sword and marches to the red flag. Nobody stands in his way as he plants his sword in the stream bank and lifts the red flag up high over his head in victory, the blue soldiers all cheering and applauding.In the evening at dinner, Percy is approached by several nymphs inviting him to a party at their quarters. As he fills his cup, Annabeth comes up to fills hers, and they talk. Annabeth explains to Percy that her mother and his father have been long time enemies for many centuries. She says she has strong feelings for Percy, but hasn't decided if they're amicable or hostile yet.The dinner feast is interrupted by the arrival of a massive, terrible winged demon appearing through a bonfire-- Hades. Hades calls Percy out and tells him that Sally is alive and well, but she is his prisoner, and he will release her to Percy only if he brings Hades the lightning bolt.After Hades vanishes, Percy wants to travel to the underworld to negotiate Sally's release, thinking Hades will have no reason to hold her once Percy explains he didn't steal the ilghtning bolt and doesn't have it. But Chiron warns him that Hades doesn't work that way, and will kill both him and Sally. He insists that Percy stick to the original plan of appealing directly to Zeus first, and then they can formulate plans to rescue Sally.Later that night, Grover finds Percy preparing to leave camp to set out for the Underworld, determined to rescue his mother. When Grover finds he cannot dissuade Percy, he insists on coming along, this being his job as Percy's protector. Annabeth also wants to come along. She's trained many years at the camp, but that's all she's done-- she's never embarked on an actual quest and hardly gotten to see the outside world. In addition, she's won a great many more battles than Percy, so her experience will come in handy. Percy is reluctant at first but then assents to their going with him.The first puzzle is reaching the underworld... none of them knows how to get there. But Annabeth believes she knows who would.The three of them visit Luke at his quarters, finding him playing video games. Luke's quarters are decked out with a lot of amenities from the modern world, including electronics, which he prefers over the ""Renaissance Fair"" decor of the camp. Annabeth knows that Luke's father, Hermes, as the messenger of the gods, has traveled to the underworld many times, and she asks if he knows anything about how to get there. Luke says he doesn't speak to his father and doesn't at all care for him ('we all have daddy issues,' he explains), but he says he broke into his father's house once and has some things that may help them. One is a pair of flying winged shoes, one of hundreds of pairs Hermes owns and uses to travel. Another is a map that will help locate three of the Pearls of Persephone. Luke explains that Persephone is more a prisoner of Hades than his wife, and she is miserable there. For comfort and companionship, she has many paramours and lovers. She gives them the pearls as a means of leaving the underworld unnoticed by Hades-- one needs only to crush a pearl underfoot and concentrate on where to go.The map will help them find three of the pearls that are hidden in the United States. It shows one pearl located in a Garden Emporium owned by someone named Auntie Em, and located in Leeds Point, New Jersey. When the pearl is found, the map will show the location of the next one. When all three pearls are collected, the map will show where they can find a secret entrance to the underworld.As a final gift, Luke asks Percy to take his favorite shield, saying it will be of help to him.Percy, Grover and Annabeth catch a bus and make their way to Auntie Em's garden Emporium. They find it seemingly unoccupied and nearly delapidated; what appears to be an icebox with free soft drinks only contains a nest of rats. There are a lot of stone statues around. Annabeth notices a stone fountain with a number of Greek gold drachmas, meaning they're on the right track. She gives them to Percy. The three decide to split up and search the whole Emporium, hoping to find the pearl.Annabeth walks past more statues, eerily carved as if cowering in terror from whatever they are pointed to face. Suddenly a strange, middle-aged woman rushes up out of nowhere, hysterically begging for her help. Barely coherent, she only manages to get out that she and her husband stopped for directions. She grabs Annabeth's forearm, hysterically begging for Annabeth to come and help her.Grover finds his way to a shed where one of the statues is of a satyr, which strongly resembles his uncle Ferdinand. In fact, it's a near perfect stone replica of him, right down to the mole on his forehead. Grover muses, deciding it can't be his actual uncle, because he was killed by...Grover freezes in horror. His uncle was killed when he was turned to stone by Medusa. Auntie *EM's* Emporium... M for Medusa. Frantically he rushes to find Annabeth and Percy. Percy hears Grover's frantic yells that they are all in trouble. He grabs his pen and activates it as his sword and rushes to rendezvous with him. Meanwhile, Annabeth is still being pulled by her wrist, by the hysterical woman, who is screaming that they have to leave before ""she"" finds them... a woman who turned her husband to stone.The scene switches back and forth a few times between Percy and Grover, running through the Emporium grounds trying to find each other... and find each other they do, literally running smack into each other. Grover tells Percy that they're in Medusa's lair. They still need to find Annabeth.Annabeth is still being pulled along by the hysterical woman, who realizes she is lost on the Emporium grounds and is terrified they'll never get out alive. Suddenly they stop short, Annabeth saying not to move. Standing right in front of them, a turban-like cloth wrap over her head and dark shades over her eyes, is Medusa (Uma Thurman).Medusa speaks slowly and seductively, telling how she creates her 'statues' which serve as her only company in such a 'lonely' place. Suddenly she addresses Annabeth as 'daughter of Athena,' showing Medusa recognizes her for who she is. Medusa explains that she once had the same beautiful brown hair as Annabeth. Toying with a few locks of Annabeth's hair, Medusa explains that she was desired and courted by many suitors, which made Athena jealous, and led her to curse Medusa.Medusa steps back and removes her headpiece, revealing the snakes that serve as her hair, as Annabeth urges the hysterical woman not to look. Both of them snap their eyes shut as Medusa's tone turns stern, saying that eyes are the windows to the soul, and she hopes they find hers attractive. She removes her dark shades, revealing her terrible blue eyes with the power to turn people to stone. Her tone turning seductive again, she gently whispers for them to 'sneak a peek' at her eyes.The lure proves too much for the hysterical woman, who looks at Medusa's eyes and promptly turns to stone; her now-stone hand still locked around Annabeth's wrist.Percy and Grover arrive, behind Medusa, and she isn't yet aware of their presence. Percy knows that they can look at her reflection safely, and takes out his iPhone. Grover says he'll get Annabeth away.Medusa cockily puts her sunglasses on the hysterical woman's left wrist and gets very close to Annabeth, taunting her that she will eventually open her eyes. Medusa gets close enough that her hair-snakes flick through Annabeth's hair and across her cheeks. Annabeth trembles in fear, desperately fighting to keep her eyes tightly shut.Hearing Medusa speak, Percy calls out, trying to give Annabeth resolve to keep her eyes closed. Medusa hears Percy's voice and whirls around, realizing that the new arrival is another demigod. She heads toward the sound of where Percy's voice came from. Percy runs, leading Medusa away from Annabeth, using the reflection in his iPhone to keep track of Medusa. As Percy pauses behind a statue, Medusa stops, recognizing Percy by the smell of his blood as the son of Poseidon. She remarks that she used to date Poseidon before pushing one statue down, causing it to topple a line of statues like dominoes; the last one landing on Percy.Annabeth struggles futilely to free her wrist from the now-stone woman's grasp, still not daring to open her eyes. Grover comes up and uses a crutch to smash the woman's arm off, freeing Annabeth. The two rush to rendezvous with Percy.Trying to crawl out from under the statue, Percy reaches for his sword, but Medusa kicks it away and lifts Percy by the scruff of his neck. Percy jams his eyes shut as Medusa holds him close to her face and tells him that she hears he has the stolen lightning bolt. She leans her head in close and tells Percy that her 'hungry babies' can open Percy's eyes for him if he doesn't do it himself. She sweetly says that he can stay with her always; all he has to do is look.Medusa's soft and seductive whisper almost has Percy about to open his eyes when Grover and Annabeth arrive on the scene, driving the pickup truck owned by the hysterical woman and her husband (they don't need it anymore). They smash through several statues, knocking Medusa down.Medusa hisses angrily, looking about for Percy. She finds his iPhone and peers curiously at it. Distracted, she doesn't hear Percy coming up behind her. She spots his reflection in the iPhone too late-- Percy beheads her with a swift stroke of his sword.Grover and Annabeth exit the truck, tapping fists in celebration of vanquishing Medusa. Though Grover is repulsed at the idea, Annabeth says they need to take Medusa's severed head with them. If they open her eyes, their power to turn living beings to stone still works. Percy asks Grover for his jacket so they can wrap up the head. Grover gives Percy his hoodie instead.After giving the head to Grover, Percy happens to look again at Medusa's headless body and realizes that she is wearing a bracelet with the pearl set into it. He pries it free and the three of them drive off in the pickup truck.As they head down the road, Annabeth wonders why Luke didn't warn them about Medusa (why indeed....) Grover asks Percy to open up the map so it will show them where the next pearl is. The map reveals the location as a replica of the Greek Parthenon... in Nashville, Tennessee (much to Grover's disgust; he hates country music).It is late at night and they are still on the road. Percy and Annabeth are fast asleep, and Grover starts to nod off at the wheel. The blare of an eighteen-wheeler's horn jolts them all awake and Grover barely swerves away. The three of them, shaken, decide to stop for the night. They make their way to a roadside motor inn and get a room.Just before sunrise, Percy is in the swimming pool, sitting on the pool floor as he loves to do. An image of his mother, and Hades holding her prisoner, flashes through his mind. He looks up and notices Annabeth standing at the poolside, watching him. He surfaces and she sits down, her feet in the water. Percy notices the bruises on Annabeth's wrist from the woman who was turned to stone by Medusa. Gently taking her arm, he heals the bruises for her through his connection to the water. He climbs up and sits beside her at the poolside and asks why Poseidon and Athena are enemies. She explains it started when they vied for patronage of Athens and the people of the city chose Athena. Percy asks what Athena is like, but Annabeth doesn't know-- like Percy and Luke, she's never met her divine parent. Percy is surprised, wondering if any demigod has ever met their divine parent. Annabeth explains that this is forbidden by Zeus himself... he decreed that all gods were prohibited from having any physical contact with their half-mortal children. Both agree that the law is ridiculous, though Annabeth tells Percy that she believes she hears her mother speaking to her in her mind in times of trouble, giving her advice. Percy realizes that's the same as the voice he hears in his head, and Annabeth says that's Poseidon talking to him.An urgent shout from Grover recalls them to their room. A news article on TV has listed Percy as a missing person... and a suspect in the disappearance of Sally. To Percy's revulsion, Gabe Ugliano is interviewed in the news segment, spouting lies about Percy having been on drugs and alcohol; and five nights ago, Percy tried to kill him and threw Sally on the ground, before Percy's 'cripple friend' attacked Gabe from behind (Grover gapes in astonishment at the preposterous story), and Percy kidnapped Sally and took her away. Percy shuts off the TV in disgust, figuring he is now a fugitive.Grover goes to the bathroom to pee and groans as he sees that Percy placed Medusa's head there. He holds it up and admonishes Percy for putting it there. A maid working at the motor inn passes by the window and sees, and screams as she rushes away. Grover curses himself for having left the curtains open. Annabeth realizes they have to leave right away.They arrive in Nashville at daytime. making their way to Centennial Park where the replica of the Parthenon is located. Inside, they stand before a huge statue of a Greek warrior woman. Percy is able to read the Ancient Greek on the nameplate and sees it is a statue of Annabeth's mother, Athena. Annabeth gazes up at the statue, wondering if her mother really looks the way she is depicted, and she smiles when Percy assures her that they'll find out. Grover looks up at a golden headdress set on the statue's head and notes that the pearl is set into the centerpiece of it.This presents a problem-- how to get up 30 feet in the air, especially while the place is filled with tourists. Percy has an idea to the solution. The three of them hide in bathroom stalls, standing on them so their legs and feet aren't seen, and wait for the place to close for the night. An hour after the park closes they come out, with the plan being for Percy to use the flying shoes to get up to the head of the statue. But although the park is closed, the Parthenon isn't quite empty... night custodians are there, cleaning the place. Annabeth loads a hand crossbow and darts between pillars, stealthily and quickly taking the custodians out with drugged darts. Grover drags the sleeping custodians to one side of the Parthenon as Annabeth sets up her wireless laptop and makes a conference call to Luke, to get instructions on activating the flying shoes. Luke quickly explains that Percy needs to get a running start and build up speed, and that it will take some practice. But Percy proves more adept than this, and although he nearly loses his grip on the statue, he is able to climb back up the pry the pearl out from the headdress. Guided by the shoes to an easy landing on the ground, they all tap fists and Annabeth hugs Percy, telling everyone to gather up their things.But they're not out of the woods yet... the custodians have recovered and form a line in front of the exit. Grover tries to bluff them by acting like he's a Park Recreational Services manager. But it quickly becomes apparent that these custodians are not ordinary people. They address Percy by name and demand the return of the lightning bolt. Percy sighs in exasperation, but his protest that he doesn't have it falls on deaf ears. One custodian coughs a puff of fire, and then all five of them merge into a giant monster... the five-headed hydra. Percy, Annabeth and Grover rush behind pillars as the middle head spews a cone of roaring flames. Percy's jacket is ignited, and when he shakes his arm to quell the flames, he loses his grip on the pearl, which flies across the Parthenon, resting on top of a flood drain grille. Activating his sword and shield, Percy takes to the air, and despite Annabeth's urgent warnings, he begins slicing off the heads of the hydra.The hydra collapses as the last head is severed, and Percy and Grover start to high-five. But Annabeth admonishes them that Percy only made the problem worse. She's the only one of the three that remembers that when one head of the hydra is cut off, two more grow back in its place.A terrible roar and the ground shaking prove the point of Annabeth's admonishment as the hydra rises again... now with ten heads; two of which spout flame. Percy tells Annabeth to distract it while he retrieves the pearl. Annabeth draws her bow, loosing several arrows to harass the hydra. But although one head is hit squarely in the eye, the hydra still turns as Percy dashes for the pearl, and the two central heads spew gouts of fire. Percy dives away, using his shield to protect himself, but the shield is thrown from his grasp several yards away. As the hydra closes in, Percy notices emergency fire hoses. Reaching out and concetrating, Percy summons the water from its holding tanks to form a wall between himself and the hydra. The wall of water also acts as a shield against the hydra's flaming breath, and allows Percy to retrieve the pearl. He dashes for the door, Grover and Annabeth right behind him... but they realize the hydra will reach them before they can get the door open. Grover gets an idea and rushes back toward the hydra, grabbing Percy's backpack. He grabs the head of Medusa, and snapping his eyes shut, points the face at the hydra and removes the shades from Medusa's eyes. Quickly the eyes begin to flash and the snake heads begin to thrash about. The flames stop short of the head and the hydra turns to stone.The three adventurers make their way to an all night diner to eat. During the meal, they see a special news bulletin on the TV where scientsts are at a loss to understand a single storm cloud that has grown so massive as to spread over much of Europe and Asia. The cloud is expanding westward toward the United States, and much of the world's coastlines are experiencing gale-force winds and massive surf waves. Annabeth realizes the gods are angry, and they need to get the last pearl quickly. They examine the map and find that it is in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Lotus Hotel and Casino.As they approach the casino, they need to fight to remind themselves that they're only there for the pearl, not for any form of entertainment. Right away a casino employee tries to make them accept a casino fun book, and they have to assert themselves that they aren't checking in. Grover figures that since the cocktail waitresses are all wearing green dresses, perhaps one of them has the pearl.Several waitresses quickly surround them, holding trays filled with cookies that they call Lotus Flowers-- the casino's signature dish. Tentatively, the three of them each try a sample. They find the cookies exquisitely delicious... not even noticing the psychedelic effect the 'lotus flowers' have on them. They start to laugh and giggle in growing excitement as they continue to look around them. In half a minute they've forgotten what they're there for, except to have fun and enjoy themselves. The decision to stay-- perhaps as permanent fixtures of the casino-- is a no-brainer.Percy, Annabeth and Grover all start to partake in the casino's festivities-- gambling, dancing, partying... and of course more of the delicious lotus flowers. But finally, just as Percy is about to eat one, he hears his father's voice admonishing him not to. The flowers dull their senses and keep them prisoner in the casino. Crinkling his brow, he excuses himself from Annabeth to walk around, and leaves the lotus flower uneaten on the bar. He begins to walk through a video arcade, declining all the waitresses who swarm around with their flower trays. Poseidon's voice guides him, telling him to focus. He passes a young man playing a pinball machine themed after the movie,The French Connection (1971). The young man asks if Percy's seen it, and Percy is stunned when the young man doesn't understand him when he says he's seen it on DVD. Quickly he realizes that the young man thinks that the year is still 1971; the year the movie was first released. Percy starts to snap out of it, guided by Poseidon's voice. He realizes the cocktail waitresses are redoubling their efforts to serve him more lotus flowers and starts to understand the entrapment effect of them. Then he walks past a roulette table and sees that the roulette ball is the pearl he came for. This jolts him completely back to his senses. As he walks away from another waitress trying to make him have another lotus flower, a bellhop turns and speaks into a headphone: 'Percy Jackson's awake.'Percy hurries back to Annabeth, finding her dancing with several young women. He grabs her and herds her to where Grover is being tended to by a group of gorgeous young women. Pulling a satyr away from beautiful women is hard enough when Grover is sober, but Percy manages to do it. Raising his voice to an urgent pitch, he finally gets through to them that the lotus flowers are putting them in a trance and making them want to stay and party. The sight of security guards converging on them helps break the trance on Annabeth and Grover. Together with Percy they must now fight their way through the guards back to the roulette table where Percy grabs the pearl. Rushing to a car on display as a prize that can be won, they use it to escape from the casino.Racing down the street until they feel a safe distance away, they recollect their thoughts. Annabeth realizes the casino is the lair of the Lotus Eaters-- and the 'casino' is where they have trapped people since ancient times. Even more dire is Grover passing a large display LCD calendar sign... the date is no longer June 15th, but June 20th... they'd spent five days and nights in the Lotus Casino's trap. The deadline being only a day away, they consult the map, finding the entrance to Hades is in Hollywood. Grover nods grimly, saying he can get them there in four hours.As they pull up before the famous Hollywood hillside sign, the radio gives a news report that the storm clouds have covered most of North America. Several states are ordering evacuations as the weather grows more severe. They run along the sign's letters, pausing as Percy notes that some of the graffiti appears to be written in Ancient Greek. Quickly he reads it: 'Woe to all depraved souls.'Quickly a patch of ground beside the letter opens up, revealing an entryway deep underground... which closes up behind them as they walk in.They make their way down a subterranean tunnel with torches and lots of skulls in the earthen walls. Presently they come to a mysterious man in a long hooded robe, standing in a canoe float in a dark river beside the platform. Approaching him, they see he is the ferryman who brings souls to Hades' kingdom. The ferryman refuses to bring them to Hades because they are still living. He tells them to come back when they are properly dead. Grover tries to bribe the ferryman with several bills of American currency. But, looking at them curiously, the ferryman burns them to ash in his hand, letting the ashes fall through his fingers.Percy realizes Grover was on the right track but used the wrong kind of currency. He gives the ferryman the gold drachmas taken from the fountain in Medusa's lair. This, the ferryman accepts, and takes them across the legendary River Styx, which is filled with centuries of broken human dreams and sorrows; wishes and hopes that never came true.Percy, Grover and Annabeth walk into the entrance to Hades' palace. They are promptly greeted by three hellhounds that guard their master's domain. THe hounds are called off by Persephone (Rosario Dawson) who brings them to Hades. The three adventurers are surprised to see that Hades has taken on human form as well (played bySteve Coogan). Hades reveals he is seeking Zeus' lightning bolt because it would allow him to overthrow his brothers and escape from the underworld, where he was exiled by Zeus. If Zeus and Poseidon destroyed each other in a war, he would be able to take over Olympus.Percy tries to explain that he doesn't have the lightning bolt, but Hades doesn't believe him. He picks up an orb and shatters it on the ground, revealing that this was where he had been keeping Sally imprisoned. Percy rushes forth to hug Sally, grateful that she is alive and well.But slowly everyone starts to become aware of Hades staring intently at Luke's shield, which Percy had dropped to the ground in order to hug his mother. The handgrip of the shield has opened up after being dropped, to reveal a secret compartment inside it. Inside this compartment is the missing lightning bolt.Percy, Grover and Annabeth realize that Luke was behind the theft of the lightning bolt all along, but none of that matters to Hades. He only cares that he has what he wanted. Picking up the bolt, he breaks his word to Percy and orders Persephone to feed Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Sally to 'the souls.'Persephone gestures and a grille over what looks like a fireplace, opens up... but behind this grille is no mere fireplace, but a furnace of damned, burning souls that start to writhe outward, smelling the living souls they are about to receive. Persephone then calls the hellhounds to herd the three adventurers toward the flames. Hades gloats with wicked glee at how he will rule the gods. Persephone grins wickedly and grabs her husband for an amorous smooch.Or not so amorous, as while Hades is distracted, Persephone snatches the lightning bolt out of his hands and zaps him with it, knocking him unconscious. Quickly she calls off the hellhounds and closes the furnace gate. Kneeling over Hades, Persephone gloats at how he will remember nothing of all these recent events when he wakes up. Although grateful, Percy is curious as to why Persephone is helping them. She explains that Hades treats her like dirt, and all she has to look forward to while in his domain, is her alotted time back on Olympus. A war of the gods would destroy all that, and leave her alone with only Hades for company-- the worst kind of company she could dread havinag to keep. She gives Percy the lightning bolt and tells him to take it, and Sally, away.But as Percy takes out the pearls, it quickly becomes evident that there is a problem. There are three pearls, and three members of Percy's party (himself, Grover and Annabeth)... but Sally makes a fourth person, and each pearl only grants egress to one. This means one of them has to stay behind in the underworld. There is a brief argument between Percy and Annabeth, both of whom feel they should be the one to stay... until Grover says that as Percy's protector, it's his duty and job to take on the burden. Persephone is delighted at this and promises to ""take very good care"" of Grover.Percy, Annabeth and Sally use the pearls to take them to Olympus, but Percy is confused when they arrive at the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Annabeth points out the terrible storm clouds above-- Zeus and Poseidon preparing for battle. Sally assures Percy that they are in the right place and shows him an entrance to a service closet that contains the secret entrance to Olympus.But Percy is not quite home free yet. There's ten more minutes until the midnight deadline, and Luke has arrived, wearing another pair of his father's flying shoes, to make sure Percy misses that deadline. Questioned by Percy, Luke reveals that when Percy, Grover and Annabeth came to see him about traveling to the underworld, he saw it as the perfect opportunity to dupe Percy into the very role Hermes normally performs... messenger of the gods. Luke hid the lightning bolt in the shield and gave the shield to Percy, so that Percy could unwittingly deliver the bolt to Hades. Reminding Percy that he bears as much animosity toward his divine parent as nearly all the demigods have for theirs, Luke wants to see them go to war and destroy themselves, believing that the demigods could then take over and rule the world as they see fit.Swooping at Percy, Luke knocks him to the ground and seizes the lightning bolt. Drawing a dagger, Annabeth engages him and fends him off, although she cannot defeat Luke while he has the lightning bolt and the flying shoes. Luke takes off into the skies. Percy reaches into his backpack and takes out the flying shoes Luke had given him, and takes off in pursuit.Luke is about to cast lightning at a passing helicopter when Percy dives at him. They wrestle in mid-air until Luke breaks free and tries to blast Percy with lightning. There is a brief cat-and-mouse game through a skyscraper's interior until Percy catches Luke by surprise and wrests the lightning bolt from him. Now it is Luke pursuing Percy, trying to recover it.Percy is almost back at the Empire State Building when Luke hurls a knife that slices the wings off of Percy's flying shoes. No longer able to control his flight, Percy tumbles to a hard landing on a rooftop. Luke picks up the lightning bolt, and questions Percy's heritage as son of Poseidon. Percy sees several water towers atop nearby buildings and concentrates, breaking the tanks open and gathering the water to deluge Luke. Gathering some of the remaining water and shaping it into a trident, Percy says that he must be the son of Poseidon after all. Hurling the trident, he catches Luke across the throat between two of the prongs, taking Luke clear out of his flying shoes and casting him into the river.Donning Luke's shoes, Percy arrives back at the Empire State building with the lightning bolt. Sally and Annabeth flip several switches in a control box in the service closet, which acrivates the hidden secret elevator that takes them all up, far past the roof of the building, into the heavens before the gates of Olympus. Sally, as a mortal, is unable to venture forth onto the divine ground. Annabeth and Percy rush to the hall of the gods.Inside the hall, the deities of the Greek Pantheon are engaged in heated argument until Zeus demands silence and crosses to a time-dial in the center of the great hall. Poseidon and Athena, despite their enmity, both make a final appeal to Zeus to avoid war. But as the time-dial signals the arrival of midnight and the passing of the deadline, Zeus is about to pronounce judgement of war. Just then, Percy and Annabeth rush into the hall bearing the lightning bolt. Zeus demands its return, and Percy does so. The bolt grows to its true size in Zeus' grasp. He says that Percy is wise to betray his father. Percy retorts that he was never working with or for Poseidon's benefit, and he reveals Luke as the true lightning thief (to the great surprise of Hermes (Dylan Neal)), explaining that Luke resented all the gods for not caring about their children, and he wanted them to destroy each other so the demigods could rule Olympus. The gods all look around at each other, seeing how they had been played and pitted against one another. Zeus accepts Percy's explanation and declares peace. Athena (Melina Kanakaredes) smiles at Annabeth and tells her she's very proud of her.Percy mentions that he and Annabeth escaped the Underworld only because Grover stayed behind. Zeus smiles cynically as he realizes that Percy wants him to return Grover to the world of the living. However, he agrees to the request. Zeus declares the convening of the gods to be adjourned. Poseidon makes a plea to his brother that he be allowed to speak to Percy, and Zeus consents-- but just this once.Percy is naturally resentful that Poseidon was never around, and that he never got to even meet him. Poseidon acknowledges that Percy was only seven months when he left him and Sally. He says that being with him and his mother, Sally, made Poseidon start to forget his duties and become more human, which Zeus didn't approve of. Percy is surprised on hearing that Poseidon's siring him was what led Zeus to pass the divine rule prohibiting the gods from having any contact with their children. Poseidon manages to come to terms with Percy, saying he never wanted to leave him or Sally, and was in fact always with him in heart and spirit; Percy acknowledging he heard Poseidon's voice when he spoke to Percy. Poseidon promises that while he might not get to see Percy again, he will always be there with and for him-- in his heart, in his thoughts, and in his dreams. Percy forgives his father and shakes hands with him.Sally brings Percy back to Camp Half Blood, where he can fulfill his destiny as a demigod. Although she will miss him, she says it's where he belongs. She also says, to Percy's great relief, that she is finally kicking Ugliano out of the house, now that he has served his purpose and she doesn't need him anymore.Percy is welcomed by everyone back at the camp, and Grover shows him that he's been promoted to senior protector, and has finally gotten his Satyr horns. Chiron starts to admonish Percy for disobeying his orders and leaving camp without permission, but then says that this is why Percy is now his favorite student-- many times he simply has to follow his own instincts. But hero or not, Percy is, to Chiron, still one of his students, and He sends Percy to suit up for more training.As Grover and Percy walk through the training area, Grover amuses Percy with stories of Grover's time in the underworld as Persephone's paramour. They find Annabeth in the same manner in which Percy first set eyes on her-- she is taking on several other students in swordplay at the same time, holding her own and more. Grover pats Percy's shoulder and tells him that he can handle this on his own now. After defeating the last of her opponents, Annabeth calls for the next one, and Percy steps up to volunteer. Annabeth puts a hand on his neck, welcoming him home and leaning in as if to kiss him. Suddenly with a mischevious look, she surprises Percy by swiping his sword out of its scabbard and pointing her own at him, telling him that he must never be distracted by an opponent. Percy grins and motions for his sword back. She returns it and they square off. The camera slowly pans back as Percy and Annabeth begin their battle, and the credits start to roll.Midway through the credits is an extra scene showing Sally telling Gabe to take all his things with him. He goes to the kitchen in disgust for a beer and finds the refrigerator locked, with a note from Percy on the door, warning that the refrigerator door must never be opened again. Annoyed, Gabe smashes the lock off and opens the door... and finds the severed head of Medusa inside. Fade to black as the snake heads lunge out, and the credits resume."
Paranormal Activity 2,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1536044/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After experiencing what they think are a series of ""break-ins"", a family sets up security cameras around their home, only to realize that the events unfolding before them are more sinister than they seem. Daniel Rey along with his wife, Kristi; daughter, Ali; toddler son, Hunter, and their dog, move to Carlsbad, California. A few days later their residence is broken into, however, nothing appears to be missing. In order to prevent re-occurrences, they install a number of security cameras that will record everything on a DVR. After they hire a Spanish-speaking nanny to look after Hunter, she informs them that there is something wrong in their house and performs prayers, much to the chagrin of Daniel, who lets her go. He will subsequently regret this decision as more inexplicable and strange incidents occur, with Ali concluding, after a research, that their house may be possessed by a demonic entity.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) The film opens with home video footage of Kristi Rey (Sprague Grayden) bringing her newborn son Hunter (William Juan Prieto & Jackson Xenia Prieto) home from the hospital. We then follow Hunter through the first several months of his life via a montage of various video clips. We meet Kristi's husband Dan Rey (Brian Boland), Ali (Molly Ephraim), his daughter from a previous marriage, Martine (Vivis Cortez), the family's housekeeper/nanny and Abby, the family's German Shepherd.A year after Hunter is born, the family comes home to find their house seemingly broken into (though both doors were locked) and trashed, though the only thing missing is a necklace which Kristi's sister Katie (Katie Featherston) had given to her. Dan has a number of security cameras installed throughout the house - in the backyard, baby's room, kitchen, living room, entryway, and outside the front door.The first night, suspicious activity begins, with the pool light flickering and eventually dying out in the middle of the night, and the pool cleaner being taken out of the pool. Soon pots begin to fall seemingly of their own accord in the kitchen. Hunter is repeatedly woken up in the middle of the night by loud banging sounds from inside the house and outside his window, and Abby is seen staring at something unseen in Hunter's room and barking or growling at it. After one evening where this happens, Martine attempts to cleanse the house of ""evil spirits."" Upon discovering the nanny performing these acts, Dan fires her. Katie and Kristi reveal that, as children, they felt they were tormented by a demon or unknown spirit, but they tried to keep the ordeal a secret and not talk about it. Ali begins investigating the mysterious happenings. She discovers that, if a human makes a deal with a demon for wealth or power, the payment for said deal is the life of the family's first-born male; coincidentally, Hunter is the first male to be born into Kristi and Katie's side of the family since their great-great-grandmother was alive.Kristi confides in Katie everything that has been happening, and tries to bring up how, as children, they felt demons around them; Katie becomes really angry and demands that Kristi not pay the events any attention, for it would just make things worse. Soon after, while Kristi is in the kitchen, the cupboards are flung open and everything explodes out of them. The violence continues to escalate; the family dog, Abby, is attacked and pulled violently off camera and knocked unconscious. Dan and Ali take the dog to the vet, leaving Kristi alone with Hunter. She goes to check on the baby and notices a light flicker off. She turns the light back on, but then is dragged by an unseen force out of the room and halfway down the stairs before she is released. Kristi runs back upstairs into Hunter's room but she is dragged back downstairs, this time into the basement where she stays for over an hour. Finally, the basement door opens and Kristi emerges, dazed and presumably possessed.The following day, Ali is at home with Kristi, who won't get out of bed. Ali goes upstairs after hearing several banging sounds to find Kristi sitting in the baby's room with a bite mark on her thigh, while Hunter is crying for unknown reasons. She hears a thump in her own room and goes to investigate, yet looks back to find Kristi has left Hunter's room. Ali goes back later to comfort a screaming Hunter while Kristi stands in his room at the window, staring out at everything; when Ali gets too close, however, she turns and commands that Ali not go near him. Ali calls Dan, crying, and begs him to come home. When he arrives, she shows him the footage from the night before of Kristi being dragged down the stairs. Dan immediately calls Martine, who prepares a cross that will force the demon out of Kristi. But she adds one last detail: the demon will have to be passed on afterwards to someone else, a blood relative, to keep it from returning. Dan tells Ali that he is going to pass the demon onto Katie so that Kristi and Hunter will be saved; she pleads with him not to, but he doesn't listen.Dan approaches Kristi, who is sitting up in bed in a daze. He attempts to touch her with the cross, but she bites him, and all the lights in the house go out. Kristi and the baby disappear, and Ali says that they're in the basement. After fumbling around and knocking things over in the dark, Dan finds Hunter in a corner of the basement, seemingly alone. From behind, Kristi attempts to attack him, knocking the camera from his hands. Dan manages to put the cross on her chest to remove the demon from her body. The floor begins to shake and demonic yells are heard. The next scene shows Dan putting Kristi to bed and then burning a photo of a young Katie, to pass the demon on to her.Three weeks later, Katie visits and explains how things have now begun happening at her house; Kristi, having no memory of Dan's actions, says that the paranormal events have stopped at her house, and that Katie should follow her own advice and not pay any attention to what is going on. After Katie leaves, we see her arrive at her and Micah's house, where he has just purchased the camera. This is where the events of Paranormal Activity take place, as the demon slowly begins to infiltrate Katie and Micah's life and eventually possess Katie and kill Micah.The next scene cuts to the night after Micah was murdered. Dan is watching television in the living room and Kristi is in the baby's room, holding Hunter because he had woken up crying. Katie, possessed and bloodstained from the murder of Micah, is seen standing in the entry of the house behind Dan. She approaches him silently from behind and snaps his neck. Kristi hears the commotion downstairs, then spots Katie approaching her from the dark hallway. Katie violently throws Kristi against a wall, killing her and Hunter begins to cry. The final scene is Katie calmly leaving the room with Hunter, who begins to giggle as they disappear down the hallway.The ending credits say that Ali was on a school trip and returned home to find her father and step-mother dead. Katie and Hunter's whereabouts remain unknown."
Unstoppable,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477080/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"With an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train barreling toward a city, a veteran engineer and a young conductor race against the clock to prevent a catastrophe. A runaway train carrying a cargo of toxic chemicals puts an engineer and his conductor in a race against time. They're chasing the runaway train in a separate locomotive and need to bring it under control before it derails on a curve and causes a toxic spill that will decimate a town.—ahmetkozan Will Colson is starting a new job as a train conductor for the railroad. He is assigned to work with Frank Barnes a veteran train engineer. Initially there's some tension between them. Later a train that is carrying chemicals is running with no one controlling it. It is feared that if it stops or crashes into a populated area it could disastrous. Connie, an exec suggests derailing it but the man in charge refuses to do that on account of what it will cost. When attempts to stop it fail, there's fear of what they can do. But when Frank and Will have a close call with it, Frank decides to stop it themselves by coupling on to it. Will is not sure about it but sticks with Frank.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In Pennsylvania, one engineer is maneuvering a train in the yard and accidentally leaves the train operating without the pneumatic brakes engaged. The operation department initially believes it is a coaster but soon the operators realize that the unmanned train is running on full power. Further, it is carrying dangerous chemicals and diesel in the cargo wagons. There are many unsuccessful attempts to stop the runaway train and the veteran engineer Frank Barnes and the young conductor Will Colson decide to take the chance to reduce the speed of the train with the most unlikely operation.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil After panning across some idling diesel locomotives under the opening credits, the film begins with scenes at two rail yards in different regions of Pennsylvania run by the Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad (AWVR). In the Fuller yard in northern Pennsylvania, children arrive for a school field trip on rail safety. Meanwhile, in the southern Pennsylvania town of Stanton, Will Colson (Chris Pine) gets up for work, stopping to surreptitiously watch his wife put their son on the school bus. He calls her but she refuses to even answer.Arriving at work, Colson, a conductor, gets his orders for the day and learns he will be working with engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington), with whom he has never worked before. He goes to a group of older workers, with whom he has some barbed words over their age differences and finds Barnes among them. While he goes to punch in, the other older workers complain about being displaced by Colson, who they say got his job through family connections in the union.Meanwhile, in Fuller, the yardmaster yells at a pair of hostlers who have been standing idle near a train to get it moved so the schoolchildren's excursion train can get out of the yard. In a hurry, one of them, Dewey (Ethan Suplee), decides to forego connecting the air hose between the locomotive and the rest of the half-milelong (1 km) train. This, the other hostler reminds him, means the train's air brakes won't be working, but Dewey says they will hook them up after parking the train on another track.Barnes and Colson meet by their locomotive for the day, where Barnes, a 28-year employee, finds out that Colson, who will be in charge of the train, is only four months out of training. He reminds Colson that if there's anything he doesn't know, he should just ask. They take the locomotive out across a bridge to where they will attach their train for the day. Colson learns that a court hearing that morning didn't, as he had hoped it would, end with the lifting of a restraining order preventing him from seeing his wife and son.In the locomotive cab at the Fuller yard, Dewey turns the throttle to its highest setting (idle) to enable the train's dynamic brakes. As it approaches a switch, Dewey sees it's not set to the right track and, against the advice of the other hostler, jumps from the slow-moving train to line it properly. While he does, inside the 777, the throttle sets itself into highest speed. When he tries to reboard 777, it has picked up speed and he falls to the ground trying. The train leaves the yard for the main line unmanned.After some slight setbacks at the yard due to Colson's inexperience, including taking on more cars than they had in their orders, the two leave Stanton for a zinc plant. In Fuller, the hostlers let yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) know that they have a runaway train headed into opposing traffic on the main line. Assuming the dead man's switch will trigger the brakes and it will be a ""coaster"" that stops a few miles from the yard, she calls Ned, a welder for the railroad and tells him to meet the hostlers where they can get in his truck, catch the train and stop it.By the time they get there, they realize the train is under power and going too fast to catch. Connie and the dispatchers work to get every train on the main line into sidings. The train carrying the schoolchildren narrowly avoids a head-on collision. Oscar Galvin (Kevin Dunn), Connie's superior, calls her and asks her what's happening and what she's doing about it. She hasn't figured out yet how to stop the train and begins calling the state police to make sure the grade crossings on the line are secured, since some of the tank cars on the runaway have molten phenol, a hazardous material.On their train, Barnes and Colson hear the dispatcher's order to pull into a siding. Barnes says they can't use the siding assigned since the train is too long for it. He asks instead if a RIP track further down the line is clear.Galvin overrules Connie's suggestion to derail the train in an area of lightly populated farmland, since it would be too costly, and it's still possible to stop the train. An emergency meeting of railroad executives approves another plan, but Galvin won't tell Connie what it is. The train's odyssey becomes a media event, followed by helicopters with continuous coverage on television and reporters at crossings in small towns. The train, picking up speed, smashes through a horse trailer caught on the tracks at one junction.The company's plan, to have a lash-up of two locomotives go on the line ahead of the runaway and slow it down while another employee and former U.S. Marine Ryan Scott attempts to board the runaway's locomotive from a helicopter, fails and leads to the death of veteran engineer Judd Stewart. The police try another plan, to trigger the safety switch on the locomotive's side with close-range shotgun blasts at a grade crossing, but stop firing when they realize the switch's proximity to the fuel tank. A state trooper's radar gun shows the train's speed to be 71 miles per hour (114 km/h). Barnes and Colson make into the RIP track in the nick of time, as the runaway smashes through the back of their consist.As it passes, Barnes sees that the coupling on the last car of the runaway is open. He decides to put the locomotive in reverse and catch the runaway. Colson, at first hesitant, joins him. Galvin insists that Connie stop them, but she refuses.Another attempt to stop the train with derailers in a small town fails because the train is too heavy and too fast. Evacuations begin as the train approaches Stanton, where it crosses the town on an elevated curve where it will derail at its current speed. If it does, it could fall into a fuel oil tank farm, causing a major environmental disaster.Barnes and Colson catch up with the runaway. After Colson manually couples their locomotive to the train, severely injuring his foot in the process, they begin slowing it down with their own brakes but not enough. Barnes goes out onto the train and begins setting each car's brakes manually, slowing the train enough to get it past the curve without derailing. In the process their locomotive's brakes blow out and the train begins to pick up speed again.Ned catches up to the train, and Colson jumps into the back of his truck. Driving at high speed they make it to the locomotive, where Colson is finally able to get into the cab and stop the train. Ned and first responders pull up next to the now stopped 777, and Colson's injured foot is treated by the paramedics. Colson's Wife arrives with their son and reunites with him. Connie arrives shortly thereafter to congratulate them and Ned while Ned is handling the press conference with another AWVR representative, surrounded by friends, family, and vehicles from first responders and news outlets.Before the closing credits, it's revealed that Barnes was promoted and later retires with full benefits. Colson is still happily with a second child on the way, recovers from his injuries, and continues working with AWVR. Connie is promoted to Galvin's VP position, while it's implied that Galvin was fired for his poor handling of the incident, causing Stewart's death and costing the railroad money and equipment. Ryan makes a full recovery, and Dewey, who is held responsible for causing the situation, is fired from his job and goes on to work in the fast-food industry."

The A-Team,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429493/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of Iraq War veterans look to clear their name with the U.S. Military, who suspect the four men of committing a crime for which they were framed. Four American soldiers who are in Iraq are sent on a mission to recover plates for printing 100 dollar bills that were used to print a billion dollars. After doing the job and returning to the base their commanding officer is killed in an explosion and the plates are stolen by another operative. They would be court martialed and sent to different prisons. 6 months later, the leader, Hannibal Smith is visited by a CIA spook who tells him he knows where the man who took the plates is and wants him and his men to recover it. So he helps him escape and he breaks out the others and they go after the plates. But after doing it, they discover that the spook might not be ok. And a military intelligence officer who was involved with one of them is pursuing them.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Meet Hannibal (Liam Neeson), Face (Bradley Cooper), B.A. (Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson), and Murdoch (Sharlto Copley). Together, they make the A-Team, a group of skilled army rangers with eighty successive missions under their belt. Stationed out in Iraq, they are approached by CIA agent Lynch (Patrick Wilson) who offers them a job involving stolen USD mint plates and a billion dollars in counterfeit money. The A-Team takes up the job, only to find that it's a setup. Court-martialed and sentenced to four individual prisons - one psychiatric ward, in Murdoch's case - the team is almost a distant memory. Six months later, Hannibal escapes prison and pulls together the team to take down the man who set them up and restore their names. With a demoted captain (Jessica Biel) on their tail - who happens to be Face's old flame - the team races to seize the plates again, only to discover that nothing is as it seems.—Amy Gallant The film opens in Mexico, with Colonel John ""Hannibal"" Smith held captive by two corrupt Mexican officers, working for the renegade General Tuco. Hannibal escapes after being left to be fed on by two guard dogs, and sets out to rescue his comrade-in-arms, the lothario Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck, who is himself held captive by Tuco at Tuco's private ranch, where Face had seduced the General's wife. Hannibal makes it to the ranch in time to save Face from a grisly demise, after enlisting disgraced Ranger Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus, driving to the rescue in B.A.'s souped-up GMC Vandura van. With the three men now on the run from the enraged Tuco, they stop in at a nearby Army hospital, to recruit the services of insane pilot H.M. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock. In a medical chopper, they engage Tuco in a vicious aerial dogfight, which results in B.A.'s permanent fear of flying, and ends when they manage to lure Tuco's chopper into American airspace, where it's destroyed by a U.S. F-22 Raptor - the capstone to an elaborate plan put together by Hannibal.The film then moves forward ""eight years and 80 successful missions later"", where the A-Team - now a highly-regarded, elite combat unit - is stationed in Iraq. Hannibal is contacted by CIA Agent Lynch, who reveals that Iraqi insurgents are in possession of U.S. treasury plates being used to manufacture counterfeit currency. Lynch wants Hannibal and his team to steal the plates and over one billion dollars in counterfeit cash that's due to be moved out of Baghdad. At the same time, DCIS Captain Charissa Sosa arrives on the scene, warning her ex-lover Face, whom along with the rest of team she has disdain for, to stay away from the plates and out of Baghdad. Against the advice of his commanding officer, General Morrison, Hannibal agrees to steal the plates, albeit in an unofficial ""Black Ops"" mission. The mission is successful, but when the team returns to base to meet their commanding officer, both the shipping container carrying the money and Morrison's Humvee are destroyed by men from the private security firm Black Forest (a fictionalized version of Blackwater), led by the ruthless Brock Pike. With Morrison the only proof that they were, in fact, acting on the U.S.'s behalf, the team is arrested, tried, dishonorably discharged and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.Six months later, a still-incarcerated Hannibal is visited by Lynch once more, who reveals that Pike may be trying to sell the plates on the black market with the help of a mysterious Arab backer. Hannibal, who has been tracking Pike on his own from his prison cell, strikes up a deal with Lynch: clean records for himself and his team, in return for the plates. Lynch agrees, and Hannibal escapes prison with the help of a drug-soaked cigar that Lynch smuggles in that makes him appear dead after having a heart attack. Hannibal then breaks out Face from another military prison (pretending to be a removal man and stealing the tanning bed Face is in). Next, Hannibal and Face break out B.A. (by ripping off the door of the prison bus transporting him to another prison). The group then breaks out Murdock out of the V.A. mental hospital in Germany where he has been committed (by distracting the hospital staff and inmates with a 3D movie by which the team crashes their van through the wall of the building so Murdock can get in and escape). The four of them then drive to a local U.S. military base so they can steal a plane to leave the country.By now, Sosa, who holds a grudge against the team for disregarding her warnings to stay away from Baghdad and getting her demoted to Lieutenant, is hot on the team's trail, and under the belief that the team is working with Pike, she tries to head them off before they leave Germany in a military Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft. The plane is destroyed by two remote-piloted drone fighters, but the team manages to escape inside the body of a tank on parachutes, which they ""fly"" by shooting rounds off and stalling their momentum.Back on the ground, the A-Team tracks Pike, in the company of the mystery Arab to an office building in Berlin, and launch an offensive in which they manage to reclaim the plates and kidnap the Arab at the same time. With the slight exception of Hannibal, the team is shocked to learn that the ""Arab"" is actually General Morrison in disguse, who worked with Lynch and Pike to steal the plates, but then teamed up with Pike to double-cross Lynch and fake his own death. When Lynch learns that the team has Morrison in their possession, he orders an air strike to eliminate them all in one fell swoop. The team barely manages to escape, and Morrison is killed.Realizing that their backs are to a wall, Face hatches a plan. Hannibal arranges to meet Sosa (knowing her phone lines are tapped by Lynch) on board a cargo ship at a downtown L.A. dock, saying he'll hand over Morrison and the plates in exchange for his freedom. Face then calls her on a second, untapped phone he had previously given her. Lynch reenlists Pike, and sets up a trap for Hannibal and company at the docks. This has been anticipated by Face, who sets off an elaborate series of diversions to split Lynch's team up, and more importantly, get Lynch directly involved. The plan nearly goes awry when Pike fires a rocket at the ship, nearly destroying it, but he's eventually killed by B.A. Lynch tracks down Hannibal and a hooded ""Morrison"", and shoots ""Morrison"" in the head before engaging Hannibal in a vicious fistfight. Hannibal soon gets the upper hand until Lynch grabs a hold of his gun, however the container they are in is lifted- revealing Sosa and dozens of Federal agents with guns drawn. ""Morrison"" is revealed to be Murdock in a melted-Kevlar helmet.Lynch is taken into custody by the CIA, but contrary to what they were expecting, the A-Team is once again arrested by the military, this time for escaping incarceration. Sosa promises to do all she can to set them free, before kissing Face goodbye as he is led into a prison van. In the van, the team laments their misfortune, but Hannibal seems optimistic, and defers to Face, who reveals a key in his mouth presumably obtained from Sosa's kiss. Face then utters Hannibal's catch-phrase: ""I love it when a plan comes together"".The film ends with a recital of the opening narration from the original television series."
Knight and Day,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013743/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young woman gets mixed up with a disgraced spy who is trying to clear his name. Looking forward to attending her sister April's wedding, the commitment-shy tomboy and classic cars aficionado, June Havens, catches a plane to Boston. Then, out of the blue, she crosses paths with the handsome and charming stranger with the killer sense of humour, Roy Miller, and just like that, June's life will never be the same again. Now, as the dashing man of intrigue plunges June into an excitingly risky world of high-speed car chases, deadly man-to-man fights, and lethal stray bullets, dangerous, no-nonsense adversaries are after the mismatched duo, hell-bent on retrieving a tiny state-of-the-art device that's worth millions. But, who's this Roy Miller guy? Is he truly one of the good guys? Above all, could he be the one?—Nick Riganas June Havens lives a quiet, fairly uneventful life. She is heading to her sister's wedding when she runs into a charming stranger, Roy Miller. Next thing she knows he's leading her into a life of car chases, fights, shoot outs and being pursued by some nasty characters. Just who is this guy?—grantss June has a garage in Boston. At an airport heading home, a man bumps into her a few times and tries to keep her off the plane. He's under FBI surveillance; they wonder if he and she are working together, so they let both on a flight full of armed men wanting to arrest the stranger. He's Roy, he shoots his way out of trouble and tells her she's in danger. She's home the next day, miraculously, when agents pick her up; Roy saves her again, and a transcontinental chase ensues with Roy convincing her that he's the good guy, protecting an energy source that a rogue agent wants to sell on the black market. Can she trust Roy, and will trust matter when the bullets start flying?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) walks through Wichita airport, seeing a particular flight to Boston is delayed. Meanwhile, a beautiful blonde woman, June Havens (Cameron Diaz), lugs a heavy carry-on bag as she checks in, asking if she has a seat on an earlier flight than she originally booked. We see Miller watching Havens, and he bumps into her a couple of times as they go through security. Havens, an ace mechanic who restores old cars, explains the special vintage parts in her carry-on bag to the security agent. They're for her father's '66 Pontiac GTO, which she is rebuilding and restoring for her sister as a wedding gift. Even though she has a confirmed reservation for her flight, she is told at the gate that it is overbooked. Miller is able to board, softly telling her that sometimes things happen for a reason. Unbeknownst to Havens, CIA Special Agent Fitzgerald (Peter Saarsgard) is monitoring Miller's movements as he speaks to his boss about something called The Zephyr. Fitzgerald sees Miller bump into Havens through airport security cameras, and wants to know who she is. Fitzgerald's partner asks if Havens should be picked up by field agents in Wichita, but Fitzgerald says he has a better idea. A moment later, the gate attendant for the flight tells Havens that a seat was found for her, and she may board. Miller is dismayed as he sees Havens board; he knows Fitzgerald is responsible.On board the flight, Havens notices that there are only 4 or 5 other people present. She relaxes with a drink, and tells Miller about her dream of someday driving the restored GTO to Cape Horn, while he checks out the other passengers. Miller sadly says that 'someday' is a code for 'never.' Havens is charmed by Miller, and goes to the restroom after a moment of turbulence causes her to spill her drink on her shirt. While she is occupied, Miller is attacked by the remaining passengers and crew. All are dispensed, including the flight attendant and pilots, one of whom demands to know where the Zephyr is, before attacking. While in battle with them, Miller demands to know why Fitzgerald put Havens on the plane.After Havens emerges from the restroom, she sees Miller holding two drinks, and goes over and kisses him. Miller calmly informs her that everyone onboard is dead. Thinking that he is joking, Havens plays along until Miller enters the cockpit. In a spell of turbulence, she notices the dead bodies falling over in their seats, and spilling onto the aisle. Miller lands the plane on a highway, but skids off the end of the road into a corn field. Miller gives Havens a drink to calm her, but she doesn't need long to see she's been drugged. Roy tells her that 'bad men' are going to find her and come see her. She needs to stress that she doesn't know Miller, and she must never get into cars with them, and she has to be very wary of the words safe, stabilize, and secure-- these words, especially if repeated, means they intend to kill her, or at least imprison her where nobody can find her. The plane explodes as Havens passes out. She awakens at her home, finding water and aspirin by her bedside, her shirt cleaned, and breakfast made and waiting for her. Post-its by Miller remind her that she doesn't know him. As she hurries to get fitted for her sister's wedding, Havens fails to see that she's under surveillance.Havens struggles through the day, trying on bridesmaid dresses for her sister, April's (Maggie Grace) wedding. Talking over what to do with their dad's GTO car, Havens is shocked to learn that April wants to sell it. Havens is lured out of the shop by a man claiming her truck is about to get a ticket, but she is accosted and surrounded by Fitzgerald and his agents, who make her get into one of the cars. Despite her claims not to know Miller, Fitzgerald shows airport security footage showing him bumping into her and talking to her in the airport, and shows proof that she was on the flight with him. When Havens insists she and Miller did not discuss any FBI agents, he asks if they talked about Simon Feck-- a name Havens has never heard. Fitzgerald drops the words Miller warned Havens about-- she will be taken to a 'secure' location until Miller is contained; someplace 'safe.' Suddenly, Miller shows up, and with much shooting and acrobatics and a pulse-pounding car chase, ""rescues"" Havens.Havens doesn't know who or what to believe, and while Miller is occupied in a gunfight, she flees, grabs a bus, and goes to the firehall, where her former boyfriend, Rodney (Marc Blucas), works as a firefighter. Upon hearing her story, he thinks she is merely over-stressed from the wedding, and takes her out for pie. While they are chatting, Miller arrives and kidnaps Havens. He handcuffs her and shoots Rodney in the thigh, giving him a flesh wound, telling him this will all turn him into an overnight hero and virtually guarantee his desired promotion to lieutenant.Miller explains that the security cameras in the pie shop caught footage that will make Havens look like his hostage, which will take heat off her name, at least with the local police. He tells her that he tried to warn her against getting on the plane. When Havens angrily protests that she felt safer with the agents than she does with Roy now, he drives into a garage, goes to the roof and uncuffs her, letting her go, but disgustedly telling her that her life expectancy is a lot shorter without him than with him. In the meantime, he has to see to the safety of someone who trusts him more than Havens does. This wins Havens over, and she agrees to accompany him as they go to pick up Simon Feck (Paul Dano), a genius inventor who created a perpetual energy battery called the Zephyr. Miller explains that he was watching over Feck, when he learned that Fitzgerald, the agent who took Havens for a ride, planned to kill Feck, sell the Zephyr and frame Miller for it all as a rogue agent. Miller and Havens arrive at his safe house in New York City where he left Feck. He is missing, but has left a message hidden among math equations, that he can be found on a train in Austria. The two are immediately ambushed by men belonging to Antonio Quintana (Jordi Mollà), a Spanish arms dealer. After Miller again drugs Havens, she drifts in and out of consciousness between their capture and escape from Antonio's men. Miller brings her to an island in the Azores that is off the grid, which he calls his home. After leaving Miller in frustration to wander the island, Havens notices a message on Miller's cell phone; a movement alert followed by a satellite zooming in to a Boston address, and a garage with a man cleaning a '67 Grand Prix. While studying this, her cell phone rings, showing her sister's caller ID. In answering the phone, she accidentally leads Antonio's group to the hideaway.Havens goes back to Miller, smiling at him, but then she starts trying to hit him. Miller dodges all her blows and catches her in a grapple, teaching her how to get out of it. She pulls him down to the ground and they roll over in the sand, both laughing. But the arrival of a remote drone is no laughing matter; Antonio has sent it to kill them.They make it to Miller's helicopter. Havens is afraid to fly, but doesn't want to be drugged again, so Miller gives her ""Vulcan neck pinch"" to knock her out, and transports her to a train heading through the Alps. Havens awakes alone and, missing a message from Miller, leaves to get breakfast in the dining car where she encounters Bernhard (Falk Hentschel), a German assassin. Mistaking him for Simon Feck, Havens tells him she's a friend of Miller and starts making small talk. When she finds the message from Miller stuck to her boot, she realizes that Feck is with Miller, and Bernhard is someone else. She hurries to the train galley, where Bernhard corners her and tries to kill her. Miller and Feck arrive, and Miller fights Bernhard. Havens tries to hit Bernhard, and he catches her in a grapple. Using the trick she learned from Miller, Havens manages to escape the hold, causing Bernhard to be impaled on his own knife. He is then knocked out of a window by Miller and presumedly killed by a train coming from the opposite direction.At the next station, Fitzgerald is leading an investigation. Miller, Havens and Feck are gone. At the car they'd ridden in, Fitzgerald breathes on the window and sees a circular mark left behind. Looking through it, he sees Miller outside, staring at him, before he disappears into the crowd.Miller puts Havens and Feck up in a hotel in Salzburg, and heads to a meeting with a mysterious, beautiful woman named Naomi (Gal Gadot). Havens follows him, and overhears him making a deal to sell the Zephyr to Antonio. Havens is picked up by the CIA and meets with Isabel George, the director of counter-intel (Viola Davis), who shows her footage from the Wichita airport cameras that, when slowed down, appear to show Miller slipping the Zephyr into her carry-on bag the first time he bumped into her, and then retrieving it the second time; suggesting he used her as a mule to smuggle the Zephyr through airport security; the bulky metal parts for her father's car hiding it from metal detectors. Director George confirms that Miller is a rogue agent, and gives her a pen to signal them when she is with Miller and the Zephyr. Miller meets her back at the hotel, and shows her the Zephyr, which is now showing signs of overheating. Havens uses a pen transmitter to notify the agents, but Miller notices, gives her a sentimental goodbye, and escapes to the roof-tops. After leading the CIA agents on a chase, Miller is apparently shot and falls into a canal. Fitzgerald notices the Zephyr is missing.Director George tells Havens they'll find Miller's body, since he had the Zephyr on him. She is returned home in time to stand at her sister's wedding.Meanwhile, Fitzgerald and his partner are driving through Germany with Feck. Fitzgerald's partner notes they're going south when they're supposed to be going west. Fitzgerald shoots and murders his partner, and calls Antonio to tell him he'll meet him in Spain in two days with Feck.Havens is at her garage after the wedding, sadly telling her co-worker that April doesn't want to keep the GTO. The partner is working on a Grand Prix. Havens hears a song on the radio that Miller used as his ring-tone, and googles the address she remembered from his iPhone. She sees it's only an hour away, and thinks it's a safe-house that Miller might go to, or have gone to. Driving there, Havens notes she's being followed, and uses another trick from Miller to give them the slip.Havens arrives at the house and meets the people living there, Molly (Celia Weston) and Frank (Dale Dye), and realizes that they are Miller's parents. She learns that Miller's real name is Matthew Knight. They believe their son, a former Army sergeant and Eagle Scout, is dead following a chopper crash in Kuwait. Frank and Molly are fabulously wealthy from winning lotteries and sweepstakes they don't remember entering; Frank insists they never did, but Molly says Frank never knows what he's typing into their computer.Havens leaves the Knights, and calls her own voice mail, announcing she knows her phone is bugged and she wants whoever is listening to know that she has the Zephyr, and wants to make a deal. She is soon captured by Antonio's men and taken back to Sevilla, Spain. She is drugged with truth serum, which makes her relaxed and happy. Antonio knows she was carrying a fake, not the real Zephyr. Under interrogation, Havens figures out that Miller wanted her to hear his phone call to Naomi, and follow him, so the agents would be led to him, and Havens would be in the clear and returned home. Growing impatient, Antonio demands to know where the Zephyr is, and she admits she doesn't know where it is, but lied about having it because she knew that would lead her to finding Miller. Antonio angrily orders Havens to be disposed of.Fitzgerald, who has kidnapped Feck. has arrived at Antonio's compound to make a deal for Feck, planning to turn him over to Antonio so he can force Feck to build another Zephyr.

Dinner for Schmucks,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427152/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After he finds out that his work superiors host a dinner celebrating the idiocy of their special guests, a rising executive questions the merits of his invitation just as he befriends a man who would be the perfect guest. Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who ""succeeds"" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called ""dinner for idiots,"" which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon.—Anonymous Tim Conrad feels he is on the verge of achieving everything he wants in life. He has a good shot at getting the promotion from analyst to executive at Fender Financial, an equity firm that specializes in distressed assets. Everything else he wants is predicated on getting that promotion. He has overextended himself financially in trying to act the success, and he feels he needs one last impressive thing in his life to convince his art gallery curator girlfriend Julie to marry him. Tim's shot at that promotion increases when he proposes to his boss Lance Fender a creative way to obtain the account of managing the personal assets of Swiss eccentric multimillionaire Martin Mueller. Beyond actually wooing Mueller, Tim has one last hurdle to overcome for the promotion: he has to impress Fender at his next regular dinner for the executives. Those dinners entail each executive bringing an ""idiot"" to dinner to be able to make fun of them without them even knowing they are the butt of jokes, with the biggest idiot earning the most brownie points for his/her respective executive. Initially, Tim, who tells Julie of the dinner, plans on making an excuse to Fender so as not to attend the dinner. However, he changes his mind when he literally runs into who he thinks is the perfect idiot, Barry Speck, an IRS analyst by day, and a mouse taxidermist - the finished creations which he places in miniature dioramas - by night. Barry ends up being a sweet but socially unaware man. Beyond Julie finding the thought of Tim attending the dinner abhorrent, Tim may find that his association with Barry has the exact opposite of its intended effect as Barry causes one catastrophe after another in Tim's life, all in Barry's effort to help his new friend.—Huggo Tim Conrad found billionaire Martin Müeller, the right Swiss prospective client for his employer Lance Fender's financial firm, but is denied the account. Colleagues tell him the way to the inner circle is to win Fender's annual private home dinner contest: bringing the weirdest guest, who will make a total spectacle of himself. A freak accident matches Tim to lunatic IRS officer Barry, who accepts on crazy terms and starts upsetting Conrad's whole life, albeit with the best intentions. They take on rock star Kieran, work relation of Tim's beloved Julie and a redoubted romantic threat. Barry's crazy boss Therman and wrecked marriage also kick in.—KGF Vissers Tim (Paul Rudd) is a rising business executive with a nice apartment, gorgeous girlfriend and a Porsche - but desperately wants to make it to a 7th floor office where he works, as those on the 6th floor 'smell like cabbage'.He proposes a risky new strategy at a board meeting to Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood), head of the corporation, to attract the $100m financial portfolio of the Muellers from Switzerland enticing them in through a love of modern art.His idea is accepted, and he manages to take the lead on the project when Mueller takes a shine to him, yet to really impress the boss he must spring a surprise at the next exclusive, and secret, dinner party Fender organizes at his mansion - he must bring the oddest character with him as a guest to entertain the execs. It'll be a 'Dinner for Schmucks' - his boss's version of a 'pig party'.Tim meets the perfect candidate - Barry (Steve Carell) - when Barry steps out in front of his Porsche while on the way to the local taxidermist with his latest diorama masterpiece. Barry is invited over to Tim's apartment, and he excitedly agrees as he doesn't get out too much.Things soon fall apart for Tim when Barry enters his life. His girlfriend, Julie, leaves him when Barry stops her outside the apartment (thinking she is Darla the mad stalker) and tells her that Tim is sleeping with someone else and what they had was a mistake.Tim breaks into Kieran the artist's apartment with Barry, but doesn't find Julie. Instead he hears that Kieran is planning to make his move now that she is available and back on the market.Knowing that Julie will be joining Kieran at his ranch for the weekend, they go to Barry's IRS office to look over his accounts and find the address of the secret rendezvous, when they meet Barry's nemesis and boss - Therman (Zach Galifianakis, the funny one from The Hangover) - who has the power to control Barry with his mind. They don't find the address - and in fact only manage to get Tim audited. Outside the office we find out that Therman is sleeping with Barry's ex-wife.Soon enough it's the lunch date with the Muellers. Tim tells Mueller (David Walliams) and his wife that Julie couldn't make it because of an injury - until Barry turns up with Darla, pretending to be Julie. Somehow there is talk of marriage, and everyone persuades Tim (who always carries around the ring) to propose to Darla - who accepts, just as Julie walks into the restaurant - and then walks out of his life.Barry feels responsible, and as they sit in the Porsche while Darla goes mental on the paint job, he swallows his pride and asks for the address from Therman.At the Ranch Tim apologises to Julie, but Barry overhears the plan about the party and that Tim thinks he is an idiot. Tim leaves alone.But things are ok as he receives a call later from Mueller, who understands about the lunch date because they have a similar Dinner for Schmucks thing in Switzerland - and that his guest is killing them at the party - Barry has made it to Fender's Dinner party. Tim joins his friend, where they must compete against a ventriloquist married to his puppet, a woman who can communicate with dead animals, a Beard champion and a Blind Fencer (the guy from the 'IT Crowd', who steals the best line in the movie - and in fact any movie I have seen in a long time --- Fencer: ""I love to paint"", Exec: ""Really? Are you any good?"", Quick reply: ""I don't know"").Barry impresses the crowd with his mice dioramas - until Tim's rival introduces ... Therman!Therman starts to control Barry with his mind. After a quick pep-talk, Tim convinces Barry that he has the power of 'brain control', which beats 'mind control' any day. Barry uses his new power on Therman and wins the contest.Tim feels guilty and announces to 'the schmucks' that the execs are just using them, and that they are the real idiots, yadda yadda. The blind Fencer goes crazy, and while attempting to stab people slices off Mueller's finger and starts a huge fire. Tim and Barry need to escape through the window.Back at Tim's place, Tim goes on about how losing Julie was the worst thing to happen to him - little knowing that Julie is standing behind him. She takes him back, and Barry convinces Kieran to leave. Both now out of work, their only comfort is each other - and Barry.So, through Mice Dioramas and cutaway scenes we're soon told that Tim and Julie managed to open a modern art museum for the Muellers, Kieran and Barry joined forces to develop their own unique style of art, Barry got together with Darla, Therman wrote a self help book that was only popular in the insane asylum where he was held, Barry organizes a breakfast club for his new ""schmuck"" friends, and Tim and Julie finally married and honey-mooned in Paris - with Barry hiding under the bed.After the credits we're told that Fender's company went bust, and he was described by Forbes as the biggest loser of all.(JT - HowDoestheMovieEnd.com)"

The famous and powerful wizard Merlin (James A. Stephens) had three apprentices to whom he entrusted all of his knowledge of magic and cast spells over them to ensure they didn't age. However, one of his apprentices, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), betrayed Merlin for his greatest enemy, the sorceress Morgana (Alice Krige).

A young boy named David Stutler (Jake Cherry) wakes up for school, greeted by his bulldog puppy, Tank. He the bus into New York City with his classmates on a field trip and draws a picture on the window which, at the right moment, makes it look as if King Kong is battling fighter planes on the Empire State Building. The act impresses his crush Becky (Peyton List). As the students rest on a side street later, Dave gives Becky a note asking her to choose whether she'd consider him as a friend or boyfriend. She writes her answer and leaves it on her bench seat but, before Dave can collect it, the note blows away in the wind. He follows it inside an antique store where Dave meets Balthazar who reprimands him for nearly knocking over a large urn, one reputed to suck anyone inside for ten years. Dave tries to explain that he was simply trying to catch a piece of paper and wound up in the store by coincidence, but Balthazar explains that there are no coincidences. Balthazar pulls out Merlin's dragon and asks Dave to hold it, saying that if it 'likes him' he can keep it. Dave takes the dragon which immediately springs to life and winds itself around his finger as a ring, revealing him as the Prime Merlinian.A relieved Balthazar explains to Dave that he's been searching the world for him and that he will grow up to be a powerful sorcerer but is, for now, Balthazar's apprentice. He tells Dave to remain in the shop and to avoid touching anything while he retrieves the book of spells from the basement. However, ever curious Dave finds that, upon moving his ring finger, a mysterious thud sounds from the wall above him. He raps the air harder and the Grimhold bursts out of the wall and lands on the floor in front of him. Dave picks it up and his touch activates the outer layer, breaking the shell open to reveal thousands of insects which meld together into a rejuvinated Horvath. He demands the Grimhold from Dave but is pinned on the ceiling by Balthazar. Horvath attacks, using his shillelagh-like staff to project his magic and Balthazar orders Dave to run with the Grimhold. In the ensuing battle, much of the store is destroyed and a fire ignites. Balthazar and Horvath are then sucked into the large urn as Dave runs outside and throws the Grimhold into the street. He is reunited with his teachers and classmates and tries to explain what just happend but, upon returning to the store, they find it untouched and empty. His classmates make fun of him while Becky can only look on sadly.10 years later, Dave is a physics genius at NYU and prefers to keep to himself. His roommate Bennet (Omar Benson Miller) tries to get him to 'participate' more but all Dave really wants to do is experiment with Tesla coils in a rented lab space, accompanied only by Tank. He has kept the dragon ring throughout the years but leaves it in the top shelf of his dresser. During one of his classes, he is reunited with Becky and learns that she works at a local radio station. Inspired by his newfound crush, Dave returns to his lab to work with the coils and the electricity they emit while listening to Becky's station.Meanwhile, after 10 years trapped, Horvath emerges from the antique urn, now owned by an elderly couple (Sándor TécsyandMarika Daciuk). Learning that he's the first to emerge, he takes the urn and tosses it out the window bidding farewell to Balthazar. Falling several stories, Balthazar manages to escape before the urn crashes to the ground. Horvath finds his way to Dave's apartment, guided there by an old school report of Dave's that was sucked into the urn with him. When Dave can't remember the whereabouts of the Grimhold, Horvath conducts a spell that sends a pack of wolves to chase Dave out of the building to nearby train tracks. Just as the wolves are about to pounce, Balthazar arrives on a large steel eagle; a gargoyle he plucked off the nearest high-rise, and turns the wolves into puppies. Balthazar takes Dave away as the next train arrives (and manages to save the puppies by imprinting them on paper which blows away).Balthazar takes Dave to the top of a building where he tells him that he must begin learning sorcery and help retrieve the Grimhold. Dave is naturally against doing anything but living a normal life until Balthazar summons Dave's dresser and pulls out the dragon ring. He then convinces Dave that, if he helps find the Grimhold, his obligations will come to an end and he can decide whether he wants to continue learning magic. Dave agrees. Using an atmospheric spell centered over the Grimhold's location, Balthazar finds that it's somewhere in Chinatown. Together, they go to an impound where Balthazar finds his old car and starts it up like new. On the way, Balthazar gives Dave the most basic of lessons in magic and tells him that the ring he wears is a focal point for the natural energy in Dave's body; without the ring, a sorcerer is powerless.Horvath returns to the antique shop to retrace the Grimhold's last location. Using a time spell, and the knowledge that Dave threw it into the street, he discovers that the Grimhold was picked up by an elderly Chinese shopkeeper (Wai Ching Ho).Balthazar pinpoint the Grimhold's location to an old shop and instructs Dave to keep an eye out on the street where a parade is takign place while he goes to fetch it. Upon entering the shop, Balthazar meets the old shopkeeper and inquires about the doll. When she falters, he compliments her in Chinese and she commends his Mandarin. However, Balthazar throws her against the wall and says that he spoke Cantonese; the old woman was Horvath in disguise who shows Balthazar the Grimhold, and another layer broken. The released wizard Sun-Lok (Gregory Woo) attacks Balthazar but is thrown out the window into the street. Dave goes to him to see if he's all right, but Balthazar advises him from above to run. While Balthazar battles with Horvath, and manages to take back the Grimhold, Dave attempts to elude the large, and very alive, dragon that Sun-Lok conjures from a group of revelers carrying a parade dragon. Balthazar advises Dave to fight back, much to Dave's bewilderment. However, Dave manages to conjure his first bout of magic and defeats the dragon and, subsequently, Sun-Lok. Excited with his first success, Dave agrees to learn magic from Balthazar.Dave introduces Balthazar to his lab space where they take up residence and begin practicing. Balthazar creates a Merlin Circle to help centralize Dave's magic and gives him a pair of what Dave calls 'old man shoes' that are supposed to help conduct the flow of energy. Balthazar tells Dave that, once he enters the Merlin Circle, there is no going back.Meanwhile, Horvath, after noticing the ring on Dave's finger and discovering that he is the Prime Merlinian, goes in search of an apprentice for himself. He is sent to the illusionist Drake Stone (Toby Kebbell) who happens to be a true sorcerer, albeit flamboyant and theatrical. He blames his alternative, magical lifestyle on the fact that his mentor disappeared and he attempted to blend into society doing what he does best - though not to the extent of Horvath. Horvath takes him to Battery Park in the financial district and points out the location for The Rising while Drake is distracted by signature-seeking fans.Dave and Balthazar rest on a bench while Dave waits for Becky to finish her shift at the radio station. When he sees her, Balthazar asserts that love is nothing but a distraction. Despite his warnings, Dave runs to meet Becky and accompanies her down to the subway. They're attacked by a mugger (Jason R. Moore) who runs off with Becky's bracelet, a gift from her grandmother. Dave runs after the mugger and uses magic to lock the gateways out of the upper subway level before confronting the man. While the mugger is initially confused with Dave's awkward stance, he is surprised to see Dave lift a garbage bin and set it on fire before he's knocked out by it. Dave retrieves Becky's belongings and invites her to visit his lab the following day. She agrees.The next day, Becky stops by as Dave and Balthazar are practicing magic. Dave eagerly puts off the lesson to accomodate Becky and Balthazar, who introduces himself as Dave's uncle, makes light of the situation and comes up with an excuse to leave them alone for the moment. He goes back to his old antique shop and goes into the basement where he takes a necklace wrapped in fine cloth out of his secret hiding place. Dave shows Becky his Tesla coils situated around the room and invites her into a small 'cage' where his main console is located. Using his computer, he programs the coils to emit electric bolts through the air at differing frequencies, causing spurts of sound which, when timed right, sound like music. Dave plays a song that Becky played during her shift and he explains that her passion for music rekindled his passion for science...and her. He admits he's sappy as they watch the rest of the light show. Later, he drops her off at her yoga class and she agrees to see him again later that night.Dave goes into the restroom where he's confronted by Drake, who addresses him as the Prime Merlinian. Confused at first, Dave is horrified to see Horvath come in after Drake. Horvath mocks Dave's faith in Balthazar and claims the man is not what he seems and that he's been withholding. He also detects that Dave is in love and threatens to end the relationship if Dave doesn't hand over the Grimhold which, he says, Dave actually knows nothing about. Balthazar comes to Dave's rescue and the two return to the lab where Dave confronts Balthazar about what Horvath told him. Balthazar reveals that the inner-most layer of the doll contains Morgana who was contained by Veronica. Balthazar and Horvath were in love with Veronica while they were apprentices to Merlin, but Veronica only reciprocated Balthazar's love. The necklace Balthazar took from his old shop was intended for Veronica. Heartbroken, Horvath betrayed them for Morgana. The purpose of Dave's training was to prepare him to be strong enough to fight Morgana and end the threat against the world once and for all. He will be ready once he is able to perform magic without the assistance of the ring. Stunned, Dave rejects the idea and ushers Balthazar out of the lab so he can prepare for Becky's arrival. Realizing the lab is an utter mess and he has little time to shower, Dave performs a spell reminscient of Mickey's fromFantasia (1940). However, as in the original, the mops and brooms soon wreak havoc on the lab and flood it as Becky arrives. Dave is forced to send her away and, while unsuccessfully trying to stop the maniacal mops, nearly falls into electrocuted water but is saved again by Balthazar who scolds him for abusing magic. Dave argues in frustration with magic and not being able to perform it well before leaving the lab in a huff.He walks downtown and sees Becky in a coffee shop talking with other friends. He walks away but not before Becky notices him. She follows him to the top of a building where he stands on the roof, contemplating getting rid of his dragon ring. She tells him that she noticed him looking sadder than usual and tries to boost his confidence by saying that one botched date wasn't going to make her hate him. They reminisce about their childhood and Becky says that what she likes about him is that he saw the world differently than other people and thought he was cool for it.Balthazar cleans the lab of the remaining water as Dave walks in again. However, Balthazar notices too late that 'Dave' is actually Drake in disguise and is tied up to a coil fan. Horvath enters and finds the Grimhold before attacking Balthazar. The real Dave enters and saves Balthazar at the last moment while Horvath and Drake escape. Balthazar and Dave give chase along the city streets, transforming the oldsmobile into a sleek sportscar. As the chase carries on, Horvath and Drake transfer to a garbage truck that crushes Balthazar's car. Balthazar and Dave escape and pursue Horvath by foot. Horvath taps a passing woman in the crowd to make her look like Veronica, distracting Balthazar and allowing Horvath to escape.At Drake's pad, Horvath reveals that it will take a great deal of power to release Morgana's shell and employs the 'parasite' spell on Drake, stealing his energy and killing him in the process. This allows him to crack the second-to-last shell which frees Abigail Williams (Nicole Ehinger), a young witch from Salem whom he sends to kidnap Becky. Once that is done, Horvath steals Abigail's energy as well.Balthazar and Dave track Horvath's location to Drake's pad where they split up to find the Grimhold. Balthazar becomes trapped in a Persian rug with a quicksand-like center while Dave finds the Grimhold. However, Horvath confronts him, holding Becky hostage. Horvath tells Dave that he will release Becky if Dave hands over his ring and the Grimhold. Dave obliges and Horvath leaves. Balthazar frees himself and finds Dave somber, though he defends the choice he made. Balthazar agrees that it was the right choice but advises Dave to stay behind while he faces Horvath alone. He then flies off for Battery Park on the steel eagle while Dave attempts to explain to a bewildered Becky everything that just happened. Determined to help Balthazar, Dave comes up with a plan and calls Bennet for assistance. They attach one of Dave's Tesla coils to the front of the oldsmobile and Dave drives out towards Battery Park with Becky, upon her insistence to help him.Balthazar arrives at the park where Horvath has released Morgana, still in Veronica's body. Morgana begins to chant ancient rites in a circle and uses the satellite dishes on the nearby rooftops to reflect beams of magic into the form of a pentacle. Horvath detects Balthazar's presence and engages him in battle, bringing to life a large brass bull which focuses on Balthazar.As Dave and Becky drive closer, Dave sees the beams of energy produced by Morgana. Becky elects to help and Dave tells her to climb to the top of one of the buildings and disrupt the flow between the discs. Before she leaves, he asks her what she wrote on the piece of paper he gave her 10 years ago. She says she'll tell him so long as he doesn't die. While she climbs to the roof, Dave manages to drive the oldsmobile right into the brass bull harassing Balthazar and uses the Tesla coil on the front to disarm and incapacitate Horvath. Balthazar's steel eagle then swoops down and carries the bull away before it can charge again. At that moment, Becky is able to knock one of the dishes out of place just as the spell is under way. All the dead sorcerers that had begun to rise disintegrate and the spell rebounds and knocks Morgana unconscious. Balthazar runs to her and, seeing that both Veronica and Morgana are still alive, performs what Veronica did. He takes Morgana into himself and revives Veronica. Balthazar winces in pain as Morgana possesses him and forces herself out of his body, manifesting in a misty haze of her former body. She attacks Balthazar and Veronica but Dave rushes in and is able to deflect her attacks without the power of the ring.Morgana focuses her attacks on Dave who uses his magic to summon electrical wires to the spot. At the right moment, he bombards Morgana with a series of electrical pulses which disable her powers. He is then able to barrage her with plasma balls and destroy her. Elated over his victory, Dave runs to Balthazar to celebrate but finds that he's collapsed in Veronica's arms. She sadly tells Dave that he's gone, but Dave won't give in. Veronica steps back as Dave uses electrical energy to restart Balthazar's heart, all while frustratingly insulting him. Balthazar comes back to life and thanks Dave before embracing Veronica and giving her the necklace he bought her. Becky arrives at the park and greets Dave. They embrace and kiss and Becky tells him 'girlfriend, definitely girlfriend'. Dave summons the steel eagle and invites Becky to have breakfast in Paris with him. They hop on the eagle and fly off into the night, David admitting that he 'doesn't know how to land this thing'.A secret ending reveals Horvath's hat in Balthazar's study, the hat that had been left behind following the battle with Morgana. A dark figure collects the hat, carrying a cane, and strolls out of the study."

However, with the world overrun with legions of animated dead, the battle against the evil Umbrella Corporation seems futile.

But is this a safe refuge, or is unsuspecting Alice walking straight into a deadly trap?—Nick Riganas After destroying the Umbrella Corporation's Headquarter in Tokyo, Alice heads to Arcadia, in Alaska, seeking for survivors and following the broadcasted message that offers security, safety, shelter, food and no epidemics. However, the place has no one but Claire Redfield that wears a strange device on her chest and has no recollections. Alice withdraws the electronic device and flies with Claire to Los Angeles, where she sees a group of survivors on the roof of a prison asking for help and under siege of the undead. They land on the roof and they learn with their leader Luther West that Arcadia is actually a ship anchored nearby the harbor that has stopped broadcasting the message a couple of days before.

All present clones are killed when the facility is destroyed in an explosion, activated by Wesker as he escapes in an aircraft. The original Alice ambushes him, but Wesker injects her with a serum that neutralizes the T-virus in her system, eliminating her superhuman powers and making her human again. He reveals that his T-Virus powers have surpassed her own, but before he can kill her, the aircraft crashes and Alice emerges from the wreckage.Six months later. Alice follows a repeating emergency broadcast from a survivors' safe haven known as ""Arcadia"" in Alaska. After many fruitless months searching for Arcadia and finding no survivors along the way, including her friends from the previous movie, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) and K-Mart (Spencer Locke), Alice begins to lose hope, believing herself to be the last surviving human on the planet. Stopping on an abandoned beach, Alice finds the helicopter taken by Claire and the others when they and Alice parted ways. A crazed Claire, under the influence of an Umbrella Corporation device attached to her chest, attacks her. Alice removes the device, finding that it has damaged Claire's memory, which she slowly regains.Flying a two-person plane, they enter the ruins of Los Angeles and find a small group of survivors, led by Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) living in a maximum security prison, surrounded by the undead. Alice crash lands the plane on the roof of the prison and learn that Arcadia is not a fixed place but actually a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. Since the plane cannot take more than two, Alice and the survivors try to figure out a means to make it to Arcadia together. The survivors have been keeping watch on a prisoner, Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller), whom they found locked in a maximum security cell when they arrived. He says that he is a Umbrella soldier who fought the early outbreak, but was locked up by prisoners as a cruel joke when the mission failed and knows a way to reach the coast, and thereby Arcadia, but will not reveal it unless he is released.They do not believe him, and keep him locked up until the undead manage to tunnel through the sewer ways and up into the prison, and a giant axe wielding monster (The Executioner) starts to break down the front gate; Alice and survivors are out of time to find a means to reach Arcadia so they decide to free Chris and use his escape route. He recognizes Claire and reveals himself as her brother, though she does not remember him. Chris' proposes using a military vehicle, stored somewhere in the prison. Discovering the vehicle is not operational, Bennett shoots Angel & uses the plane to escape. The remaining group has no option but to use the sewer tunnel. The group fights their way out Luther is trapped when the tunnel caves in - Alice, Claire, and Chris manage to escape through the sewers.They continue to Arcadia, finding the ship completely functional, but abandoned. Exploring its inner depths, they realize that it is a trap set by Umbrella to lure survivors to the ship to conduct experiments on them. Claire now remembers what happened to her group when they arrived at Alaska: Umbrella troops ambushed their group when they landed on the beach, attaching the devices to them, though she managed to escape. They release the survivors, among them K-Mart, and Alice continues deeper into the ship, finding escape helicopters and a purge bomb. Deeper inward, she finds Wesker, who explains the price of his survival, is a war within himself for control against the T-Virus. He hopes to gain control of the virus by assimilating Alice, the only individual to bond successfully with the T-virus. At this point the crew of the ship had abandoned Wesker, terrified by his cannibalism.Chris, Claire, and Alice battle the super-powered Wesker and seemingly kill him, with help from a recovered K-Mart who knocks Bennett out with the weapon he was trying to grab. Bennett awakens to find he is being locked in with Wesker's body by Alice and the others. He curses at them from the speakers but is silenced when Alice shoots out the intercom. Wesker does not die, but rather regenerates and devours a petrified Bennett (off-screen). Wesker escapes again by helicopter, activating the purge bomb on the Arcadia in an attempt to destroy the ship and kill the remaining survivors. Anticipating Wesker's actions, Alice had hidden the bomb onboard his helicopter, which is destroyed as she watches from the deck of the Arcadia, with Claire and Chris. Momentarily blinded by the flash from the explosion, a figure parachutes away from the destruction unnoticed... implying that Wesker has survived yet again. Elsewhere, Luther emerges from the sewers, having escaped his infected attackers.Alice resolves to turn Arcadia into a real safe haven and broadcasts its message for any other survivors. As Claire, Chris, and Alice decide how to proceed with all the survivors, they look up over the ocean to see an approaching Umbrella assault fleet of fix-winged helicopters loaded with murderous and heavily armed Umbrella troops. It is revealed that the troops are led by former Raccoon City police detective Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), who is under the control of the same Umbrella device used on Claire..."

A seasoned team of bank robbers, including Gordon Jennings (Idris Elba), John Rahway (Paul Walker), A.J. (Hayden Christensen), and brothers Jake (Michael Ealy) and Jesse (Chris Brown) Attica successfully complete their latest heist and lead a life of luxury while planning their next job. When Ghost (Tip T.I. Harris), a former member of their team, is released from prison he convinces the group to strike an armored car carrying $20 million. As the ""takers"" carefully plot their strategy and draw nearer to exacting the grand heist, a reckless police officer (Matt Dillon) inches closer to apprehending the criminals.—The Massie Twins In Los Angeles, Gordon Jennings leads a specially comprised gang which carries out high stakes heists, the gang comprised of A.J., John Rahway, and the Attica brothers, Jake and Jesse. Each member was so chosen for the skills he brought to the group for their heists, which have been lucrative for them to live the high life, and to which they adhere to a strict set of rules to ensure their safety. On the day of their latest heist, a bank robbery which netted them $2 million, they come under the scrutiny of LAPD Detectives Jack Welles and Eddie Hatcher, the former, a divorced father, who is a bit more intense in his focus on nabbing the bad guys no matter what it takes. The day of that bank robbery also coincides with the release from prison after five years of one of the gang's former members, Ghost, the dynamic of the gang which has the potential to be more complicated with his return, in addition to some individual emerging issues, most notably Gordon's older junkie sister, Naomi Cozier, for who he cares, checking herself out of rehab earlier than planned. Ghost comes bearing news, which he learned in prison, about the specifics concerning an armored truck which will be carrying $12 million. Despite not fully trusting Ghost who may resent having been the only one to endure prison on their behalf, Gordon, with some extra safeguards, decides that the $12 million is too big a fish for them collectively to ignore. Beyond the issues previously mentioned, what happens with the heist and Welles and Hatcher's pursuit of the gang is further affected by the entrance of the third group, from who Ghost got the information, and the police going through their own internal problems with one of their own suspected to be on the take.—Huggo Two detectives, Jack Welles (Matt Dillon) and Eddie Hatcher (Jay Hernandez), investigate a daring heist by a group of well-organized bank robbers. The crew, led by Gordon Cozier (Idris Elba), consists of John (Paul Walker), A.J. (Hayden Christensen), and brothers Jake (Michael Ealy) and Jesse (Chris Brown) Attica. The crew is without a former member, Ghost (T.I.), who was caught during a previous robbery 5 years ago. In his absence, Jake has begun a relationship with his former girlfriend Lilly (Zoe Saldana), who has accepted his proposal.Ghost surprises the crew after getting paroled. He insists he harbors no ill feelings toward the crew for abandoning him and draws them into a heist of an armored car for a $20 million dollar payoff. Meanwhile, Welles begins to zero in on some of the members of the crew and comes up with evidence that a second heist is in the making. Welles finds that a crew is looking for a large amount of C4 & tracks the sellers & has to shoot them dead in a gunfight. In the crime scene evidence, he finds a photo that links Ghost to the suppliers of the C4. Welles starts tracking Ghost which leads him to the entire crew. Welles is convinced that the crew conducted the bank heist & now Ghost is engaging the crew again for a another job.Jake does not like that Ghost is pushing the crew into a job so soon after they conducted the bank heist, but is forced to go along when the other crew members rule out possibility of foul play from Ghost.
On the day of the 2nd heist, Welles finds out that Hatcher is a crooked cop & has released convicts in exchange for drug money. The same day Welles & Hatcher trace Ghost to Gordon via the marked money that was stolen from the bank. Surveillance tapes of the bank place Gordon inside the bank a few minutes before the heist. Welles and Hatcher go in to arrest Gordon, not knowing that the 2nd heist is in progress.They create a subway and call it ""The Subway"". The plan is to rob the cash from an armored car by blowing up a hole in the street when the car passes over that spot. At the last minute the boy on a bike passes in front of the armored car & it brakes just when the explosives go off and create a hole in the ground. The armored car stays at street level as it stops just short of the crater created. John takes the initiative and captures one armored car & pushes the one with the money into the crater. The crew open the armored car & escape with the money via sewer tunnels into subway stations.Welles & Hatcher are on their way to arrest Gordon when they hear the broadcast on radio & head to the crater site. Welles figures out that the crew is using subway stations & locates the nearest one. A protracted chase ensues during which Jesse is cornered and he is forced to shoot Detective Hatcher in his escape. Despite his partner's best efforts, Hatcher dies from his wounds.
Jesse reconvenes with the rest of the crew at a hotel room and admits to the shooting of Hatcher and this almost results in a confrontation between Jesse and Gordon. Russian gangsters immediately storm the room and attempt to gun down everyone present except for Ghost, who earlier climbed out through a window. Ghost had previously cut a deal with the Russian gangsters to kill his former crew-mates in exchange for half of the heist's take. A.J. dies in the ensuing firefight but Jake manages to kill the Russians. Jake and Jesse return home where, to his horror, Jake finds Lilly's lifeless body. The police surround their home and shoot the two when they make a suicide charge outside.Gordon and John separate to make their escape but realize Ghost intends to take all of their money, which is being held by Scott (Johnathon Schaech), a well-connected fence. Ghost sneaks onto Scott's private plane and kills him, taking their laundered money in two large suitcases. Gordon and Detective Welles arrive and a three-way Mexican standoff results in which Ghost hits both Gordon and Welles. As Ghost prepares to finish off Gordon, John arrives and shoots him dead. He and an injured Gordon take the money and drive off, with Gordon's sister Naomi (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) in tow. A gravely-wounded Welles manages to call 911 for help on his cell phone.As John and Gordon drive off, John asks Gordon ""Are we good?"" and Gordon replies by saying ""All signs point to it."" (a reoccurring dialogue between the two characters, usually used before a job). The film ends without revealing whether either Gordon or Welles survive their injuries."

Soren (Jim Sturgess), a young barn owl, is kidnapped by owls of St. Aggie's, ostensibly an orphanage, where owlets are brainwashed into becoming soldiers. He and his new friends escape to the island of Ga'Hoole, to assist its noble, wise owls who fight the army being created by the wicked rulers of St. Aggie's. From the Studio that brought you Happy Feet (2006), and Zack Snyder, the director of Watchmen (2009) and 300 (2006), comes the story about an owl who is kidnapped by an evil Owl army, he must escape with new-found friends and seek the legendary Guardians to stop them.—Andrew Collins Soren, a young barn owl, is kidnapped by owls of St. Aggie's, ostensibly an orphanage, where owlets are brainwashed into becoming soldiers. He and his new friends escape to the island of Ga'Hoole, to assist its noble, wise owls who fight the army being created by the wicked rulers of St. Aggie's. With new friends, a young owl seeks and finds the legendary guardians of Ga'Hoole, an army of warrior defenders. With the guardians and his friends, the young owl helps to defeat a threat to restore freedom and peace for all who are affected.—RECB3 Soren (Jim Sturgess), a fledgling barn owl, lives peacefully in the forest of Tyto with his family; his father, Noctus (Hugo Weaving); his mother, Marella (Essie Davis); his older brother, Kludd (Ryan Kwanten), his younger sister, Eglantine (Adrienne DeFaria) and Ms. P the family's nest maid. Noctus enjoys telling Soren and Eglantine stories of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, a mythical group of warrior owls, who once saved all owlkind from the evil ""Pure Ones"" in a great battle in which the Guardians' leader, Lyze of Kiel, defeated the Pure Ones' leader Metal Beak. Kludd, however, thinks Soren soft-headed for believing in such stories. One night, while branching, a jealous Kludd pushes Soren and loses his balance in the process, and they both fall to the ground below. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved and also kidnapped by a pair of Long-Eared Owls named Jatt (Leigh Whannell) and Jutt (Angus Sampson).They are taken to St. Aegolious, home to the Pure Ones, where Soren meets an (elf owl) named Gylfie (Emily Barclay) and her captor, a (boreal owl) named Grimble (Hugo Weaving). The two are roughly thrown into a crowd of other kidnapped owlets. Nyra (Helen Mirren), second-in-command of the Pure Ones and the mate of Metal Beak, claims that the owlets now work for the Pure Ones as slaves. Soren and Gylfie protest, and are sent to be pickers, along with most of the captive owls. Kludd denies his brother, and goes away to be a soldier with other selected owls. They are tutored by Nyra in the ways of the Pure Ones, who believe that Tyto owls (barn owls and their relatives) are the strongest owls and that, because of this, they have the right to rule the owl kingdoms.The other captured owls are forced to sleep under the full moon. Gylfie informs Soren that this will cause ""moon-blinking"", a trancelike state in which owls lose all sense of will and individuality. Soren and Gylfie stay awake, which means that they are not moon-blinked. They are brought to a large cavern to pick through owl pellets for small metal flecks. Soren discovers that the flecks en masse cause weakening pain in owls, when he is ordered to deliver a fleck to the bag they are kept in. The full bag is then carried away by a large bat to a gigantic metal container. Metal Beak (Joel Edgerton) and an unknown owl watch from above, making a bargain in which the unknown owl will receive a portion of the owl kingdoms and the Tree in return for laying a trap for the Pure Ones' enemies, the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.Grimble secretly takes Soren and Gylfie to his library, where he reveals that he is not truly a Pure One. He also tells the two owlets that his family was captured by the Pure Ones and forced into their service. He teaches Soren and Gylfie to fly, so they can warn the Guardians of the Pure Ones' plans.Kludd has become a strong soldier, and his promise prompts Nyra to ask him about Soren's similar potential. Hoping to recruit him, the Pure Ones interrupt Grimble's flying lessons. Nyra attacks Grimble, Soren and Gylfie. Kludd joins the fray on Nyra's side, ignoring Soren's pleas. Grimble sacrifices himself to hold them back, and Soren and Gylfie just barely escape to begin their quest.On their journeys, they meet a (burrowing owl) named Digger (David Wenham); a (great gray owl) named Twilight (Anthony LaPaglia); and Soren's old nestmaid, a (snake) named Mrs. P (Miriam Margolyes). They join Soren with the promise of leading him to the Sea of Hoolemere, the location of the Great Tree and the home of the Guardians.Soren and his allies are mobbed by (crows) on the way to the Sea and they nearly loss Twilight's lute, in which Mrs. P is riding. The battle brings them to the shore of the Sea of Hoolemere and the home of an (echidna) mystic (Barry Otto). The crows deliberately led them to the meeting so that the Echidna could give them their bearings to the Great Tree. Far out over the ocean the group encounters a fierce hurricane, and Digger falls towards the sea. Soren dives to save him, only to find Digger being rescued by an enormous (snowy owl) with an armored mask - a Guardian of Ga'hoole. The Guardian leads Soren and his friends through the storm to the Great Tree.Digger's saviors are Boron and Barran, the king and the queen of the Tree. The king and queen, as well as the ranking officers of Ga'hoole, hear Soren's tale. The search-and-rescue squadron leader, a (great gray owl) named Allomere (Sam Neill), expresses doubts about Soren's story. But battle-scarred (whiskered screech owl) Ezylryb (Geoffrey Rush) defends Soren. Boron decides to send a scouting party, led by Allomere, to St. Aegolious.Soren, Gylfie, Twilight, and Digger begin their training in the different trades of the Tree. During one lesson, Ezylryb takes them out to learn how to ""really fly,"" using a powerful storm to teach the young owls how to use the wind currents instead of fighting them. Soren briefly masters the technique of flying by instinct, only to lose control and to be saved by Ezylryb.After the lesson, Soren converses with Ezylryb in his hollow tree and learns that Ezylryb is, in fact, Lyze of Kiel. Soren is disillusioned with the seemingly heroic stories when he sees his hero's disfigurements and hears that the battle in the stories wasn't as heroic as he thought.Allomere returns without his scouts. He tells King Boron that they were ambushed; that the scouts were killed; and that he barely managed to return with two moon-blinked owlets. One of the moon-blinked owlets is Eglantine, who was kidnapped by Kludd.Outraged, the Guardians go to war. At the urging of Ezlyryb, Soren reluctantly stays to tend to Eglantine. She soon awakes, but with shocking news: she wasn't rescued, but given to Allomere by Kludd. Allomere is revealed to be a traitor, and Soren and his friends rush to the Guardians' aid.When the Guardians arrive at St. Aegolious, they are drawn into a trap. Allomere peels off at the last moment and the Pure Ones unleash the power of the flecks against the Guardians, leaving the owls helpless on the ground. Soren and his friends arrive minutes too late, just as Metal Beak and Nyra send the bats to finish off the defenseless Guardians. Soren sends Twilight, Digger and Gylfie to hold back the bats. He plunges into the burning forest fire, carrying an oil lamp that becomes engulfed in flames after flying through the fire. The band's unprecedented arrival causes Metal Beak to distrust Allomere. Believing that he has been betrayed, Metal Beak orders a group of bats to viciously kill Allomere.Soren plunges into the flecks' magnetic field to drop the flaming oil lamp on the mechanism which holds open the lids over the flecks. The fire spreads across the machine and burns through the ropes. The lids slam down, freeing the Guardians.With his plan disrupted, Metal Beak orders the Pure Ones to fight the Guardians. Ezylryb and Metal Beak square off, as do Soren and Kludd. Their fight leads to them ending up in the burning forest. Soren tries to talk some sense into Kludd, who tells his younger brother that the Pure Ones believed in him when no one else did. He attacks Soren with renewed vigor, sending them both tumbling over a fallen tree and causing Kludd to break a wing. He convinces Soren to save him, only to attempt to pull his younger brother into the flames and strike him. Soren dodges the attack, resulting in the branch his brother had hold on to snap, causing Kludd to fall into the flames.Soren sees Ezylryb, Metal Beak, and Nyra are engaging in fierce combat. Filled with rage, he snaps off a burning branch and flies off to help Ezylryb and avenge his brother's supposed death. He takes Metal Beak by surprise, arriving in time to save Ezylryb. A few moments after, Metal Beak easily overpowers Soren and throws his branch away. Soren regains his weapon, just as Metal Beak moves in for the kill. Metal Beak impales himself on the branch, and Nyra retreats with the remaining Pure Ones.Soren and his friends return to the Great Tree with the owlets, and Soren is greeted by Eglantine and his parents. Soren, Gylfie, Twilight, and Digger are made Guardians of Ga'Hoole.In the epilogue, Soren reveals that Kludd's body was never found and Nyra is still out there with a contingent of Pure Ones. Kludd is then shown to be alive, now with the glowing red eyes of the other Pure Ones, and stares at Metal Beak's body and mask, hinting at a sequel with Kludd as the new Metal Beak."

After horrible, indecipherable events start to take place, the two take the help of Elise Rainer, a paranormal investigator, who brings the family sinister and horrifying news about their boy that makes a coma the least of their worries...—john_regrut At the beginning of the film, a shadowy old woman is seen inside a house while the inhabitants sleep.
Renai and Josh Lambert have recently moved into a new home with their three children. One morning, Renai looks through a family photo album with her son, Dalton, who asks why there are no pictures of Josh when he was a child. Renai reasons that he has always been camera shy and disliked taking photos of himself. One evening, Dalton sees the attic door open and goes to investigate after hearing sounds upstairs. As he enters inside, he tries to climb a ladder to turn on the light, but falls when the ladder cracks. As he falls to the floor, he seems to stare in horror at the darkness as if looking at something terrifying. Shaken, he is put to bed by Renai and Josh and told not to play in the attic because it is off-limits. The next day, Dalton does not awaken from his sleep. Renai and Josh rush him to the hospital, where the doctors say he is in an inexplicable coma.Three months later, Dalton is moved back to his home while still in a coma. Shortly after, disturbing events begin to occur. The first is when Renai hears a voice on the baby monitor which shouts ""I want it now!"", a bloody hand-print on Dalton's bed and a strange but frightening man in her infant daughter's bedroom. Renai becomes more disturbed when their youngest son, Foster, says he does not like it when Dalton ""walks around"" at night. Renai tells Josh about the events, but when she is assaulted by the strange man that night, she begs Josh and the family soon moves to another house.In the new house, the supernatural events continue to occur, such as a strange, dancing boy, and soon become increasingly sinister. Lorraine, Josh's mother, recalls having a strange dream of going inside Dalton's room in the night and seeing something standing in the corner, and when questioned ""What do you want?"", it replies ""Dalton."" Subsequently Lorraine sees a red-faced figure standing behind Josh that roars at her and Dalton is then violently attacked in his bedroom. This prompts Lorraine to contact a friend, Elise Reiner, who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity. The family, Elise, and her team enter Dalton's room and Elise sees and describes a figure to one of her two assistants, who draws a black figure with a red face and dark hollow eyes on the ceiling of Dalton's room; the same figure that Lorraine had seen before in the house.Elise explains to Renai and Josh that Dalton has the ability to astral project while sleeping and that he has been doing it since he was very young. The reason that Dalton is in a comatose state is because he has fearlessly traveled too far into different spiritual worlds (he believes the projections are dreams) and has consequently become lost in a land called ""The Further"", a place for the tormented souls of the dead. While Dalton's spirit is in this other world, he has left nothing but a lifeless body. The tormented souls crave another chance at life through Dalton's state, while there are others (possibly the old woman and the frightening man) who are more malicious in using him, and then there is the red-faced figure, revealed to be a demon, who wants to use Dalton for a more malicious intent. However, for a spirit to consume a body, a period of time and energy are required.Skeptical at first, Josh later relents when he discovers Dalton had been drawing pictures which resemble the demonic figure Elise described. They run a session to try to communicate with their son but Dalton appears and the demon uses Dalton's body to fight the group, along with other entities who want Dalton's body. After the session, Elise calls Lorraine and the two reveal to the couple that Josh also can astral project and was terrorized by an evil spirit during his childhood. Lorraine shows them pictures from Josh's childhood, revealing a shadowy old woman (the same woman from the beginning of the film) behind him. The more photographs taken of Josh, the closer the shadowy woman begins to get to Josh until she is inches away from him, explaining his fear of photos. Elise suggests that Josh should use his ability to find and help return Dalton's soul, to which Josh agrees.To prepare to astral-project and find his son, Elise sits him in a chair and places him in a trance. Josh suddenly awakes to find that he has astral-projected seeing his own self asleep in the chair as well as the others in the room. He proceeds outside in a misty emptiness in an attempt to find his way to Dalton. After encountering a boy who points him back towards a house (the same home that the Lamberts moved out of), he proceeds, only to encounter a family who is shot by a bizarre, smiling female member of the family in the living room. Startled, Josh makes his way to the attic where he discovers a red door (the same one drawn in Dalton's pictures). Before he can enter, the violent man seen by Renai in their daughter's room appears and attacks him. Once defeating him, Josh enters the red door.Inside is ""The Further"" and the red-faced demon's lair. While entering a cavernous red room, Josh discovers a sobbing Dalton, chained to the floor. Josh frees his son, but the demon has discovered Josh's presence and attacks them. In search of their physical bodies, Josh and Dalton flee the demon's lair, with the demon in pursuit. Just before the two awaken, Josh leaves his son to confront the shadowy old woman who appears to be inside his house. As he shouts for her to get away from him, screaming that he isn't afraid of her, she retreats into the darkness. Moments later, Josh and Dalton both awaken, just as all the spirits vanish.With the family now happily reunited, Renai, Dalton, and Lorraine chat in the kitchen as Elise and Josh pack up from the long night. Josh hands Elise the pictures from his childhood, and as she takes them from his hands, she senses something and takes a picture of Josh. He promptly goes into a rage, screaming that she knows that he doesn't like to get photographed, and leaps on her before strangling her to death. Renai hears Josh yelling and goes into the room to find Elise dead and Josh gone. She searches for Josh and finds everyone is gone, the house dead silent. She looks and comes across Elise's camera, seeing a picture in it of the shadowy old woman. It's revealed that what Elise saw was Josh's old and dirty hand and nails, similar to the old woman's, implying that she has possessed him. Josh then puts his hand on Renai's shoulder, saying ""Renai, I'm right here,"" and horror envelops her face as she looks behind her.In a post-credits scene, the shadowy, old woman can be seen blowing out a candle and the screen fades into total darkness."

Because of her fiances many connections, she is left alone to sightsee. Among the sights she finds the ""Secretaries of Juliet"". There, woman write to women who have left letters to Juliet for love advice. While picking up the letters, she finds one that was written 50 years ago. Being a believer in true love she writes hoping to give the girl the answer she was searching for so long ago. She never expected her to come to Verona, bringing along her very attractive grandson. They soon begin a journey to find the notorious Lorenzo Bartillini. The movie begins with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) walking through downtown New York while on the phone, trying to track down several individuals to see where they were on the day they found out WWII was over. In her hand she has a picture of the famous kiss that took place between a sailor and a nurse, and she's trying to confirm if it was staged or spontaneous. As she's in Times Square, where the picture was taken, she finds the right person who can verify her question.She meets with her boss at the New Yorker who asks her to be very certain that the information is correct, which she is, and he compliments her on her work. She asks him if she can start to submit some stories to him as she really wants to write, but he says she's such a good fact checker that there is no need to want more. He then asks her about the trip she is going on. Sophie and her fiancé Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) are leaving on a pre-honeymoon trip to Verona, Italy, because he will be opening up a restaurant in a few weeks and there will be no time to go after the wedding.She heads to the restaurant to find Victor unhappy because she can't write like she wants to, and finds that instead of packing, he's in the kitchen reinventing the noodle. She's annoyed because they're leaving for Italy in 12 hours, but he sweeps her off her feet and makes her smile and forgive him.They fly to Italy and stay at a hotel in Verona, where their room has a small balcony. They are both so excited to be there but for different reasons. Victor has been called by his manager, who has arranged for him to meet with some of their suppliers while he's there, and they spend the first day traipsing around the countryside meeting with suppliers at the wineries and in the cheese shops. Victor speaks fluent Italian and Sophie doesn't, so she's left out of most of the conversations. She's visibly getting more and more annoyed and finally snaps a little when Victor says that they are now ready to go on to the forest 125 kilometers away to see his truffle supplier. Sophie says she doesn't want to go, and wants to do some sightseeing with him, but Victor really only cares about the food. He makes her feel guilty by saying that he'll do what she wants, even though it's obvious that it's not what he wants, and she relents and offers to go sightseeing alone while he goes onto see the truffles. He claims its a win-win situation but Sophie isn't sure.We later see Sophie wandering through the streets of Verona by herself and she stumbles upon a tiny alleyway where a crowd of people stand. It's the alley below the balcony made famous by William Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet, and it's known as Juliet's balcony. There are many people there, especially young women and girls writing letters which they pin on the wall for Juliet. Sophie stops one girl who's sobbing and asks if shes ok, and the girl, speaking only Italian, makes it clear that her heart has been broken.Sophie stays to write and spots a woman taking down all of the letters and putting them into a basket, taking them away with her. Sophie is curious so she follows the woman to a house several doors down and discovers the office of a group of women known as the Secretaries of Juliet. They take down the letters each day and write back offering advice and comfort. Sophie is so intrigued and fascinated that she stays for the day learning about them. She's invited to stay for dinner by one of the women but she says she needs to get back to Victor, who will be missing her. The mother of the woman sends her back with dessert for them both.She goes to the hotel to tell Victor about her find, but he can't concentrate on what she's saying, as he's too busy smelling and then enjoying the food she's brought back with her. He goes with her the next day to meet the woman who prepared the food and tells Sophie that he really wants to stay to learn how to cook from her. Sophie is disappointed once again but is excited to spend the day with the Secretaries of Juliet, seeing what they do. As she's helping to take down the letters off the wall that afternoon, she comes across a hole in the wall where a letter was left more than 50 years ago. It's from a young British girl, Claire, who writes that she left her love, Lorenzo Bartollini, and didn't run away with him as she had promised she would. She asks Juliet for guidance but, until now, the letter hasn't been seen. Sophie is moved by the letter and insists that she must write back. She spends all day perfecting her words and sends the letter out.She returns to the hotel and Victor tells her about an amazing opportunity. He has to go to a wine auction for several days but he can only get one ticket. He tells her that if she doesn't want him to go he won't go, but it's obvious he's already made up his mind. She tells him to go and he tells her that she can stay and write with the women and do her thing and it's a win-win situation again.Several days later, Sophie is sitting with the Secretaries and a man comes in asking who wrote the letter to Claire. Sophie is shocked that it actually found her, and the man turns out to be Claire's grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan) who has come with his grandmother on her journey. Sophie desperately wants to meet Claire (Vanessa Redgrave), but Charlie refuses, saying that she's done enough, and angrily leaves. Sophie follows him to meet Claire who has been waiting under Juliet's balcony in the alleyway. Sophie introduces herself, to Charlie's annoyance, but she and Claire quickly become friends. They have dinner together that night and Claire reveals she has come to find Lorenzo and apologize for being such a coward, and shows that she still has the ring he gave her. Charlie is worried about this plan, but Sophie asks if she can come along, as she would love to write a story about it all. Charlie and Sophie argue but Claire says that she would love for Sophie to come with her.
They drive to the village where Claire first met Lorenzo, and meet a man called Lorenzo Bartollini but he's not the right one. They regroup and try to narrow down how many people there are by the same name, and map them throughout Tuscany, since Claire is certain that he would never have left the area.They show a montage of clips as they meet different Lorenzo Bartollinis and each time it's not the right man. However, most are very attracted to Claire and offer that they would be happy to be her Lorenzo whenever she likes. Each night they return to a local hotel in Sienna, where they regroup and Sophie and Charlie come to a truce and then eventually a better understanding of one another as they reveal why Charlie is so protective of his grandmother. He explains that his parents were killed in a plane crash when he was young, and Sophie tells why she is clinging to Victor so hard (her mother walked out on her and her dad when she was very little). Sophie calls Victor each night but he's distant and uninterested in what she's doing and keeps adding just a few more days to his trip to do more of the things for his restaurant. Meanwhile, Charlie has taken a very big interest in Sophie and tries to spend more time with her each day. However, as they continue to look for Lorenzo Bartollini, they discover that one recently died and Claire is obviously upset because she has no way of knowing if it was her Lorenzo. Charlie takes his anger out on Sophie and says that it's all her fault, and what would she know about loss. Her mother didn't die, she just left. Claire scolds him and says that in Sophie's case it was worse, because her mother chose to leave her. They are quiet as they return to the hotel that night and Charlie says that it's time to go home. That night, Sophie comes out to speak with Charlie who's lying on the ground looking at the stars. She joins him and tells him that she's not sorry that she sent the letter, but she is sorry that they are leaving. Charlie says the same thing, and that he doesn't want to go, meaning that he doesn't want to leave her. He kisses her and she kisses him back and then suddenly realizes what she's doing and gets up and goes inside. Charlie doesn't know whether or not to say anything, and we see that Claire has been watching from her window the whole time.The next morning they are all quiet and Claire tries to lighten the mood and encourage them to not be afraid of their feelings. She suggests that they go and get a bottle of wine at a vineyard that they pass to prolong their journey. As they drive through the vineyard Claire spots a young man working in the fields and she begs them to stop the car. She looks like she's seen a ghost and says that the young man IS her Lorenzo. Sophie goes to ask him his name and it's Lorenzo Bartollini. Charlie gets excited and joins Sophie as another man comes up and asks what's going on and says that HIS name is Lorenzo Bartollini. Sophie deduces that they must be his son and grandson. They ask where their father is and are told that he's out riding and will be back soon. Claire begs them to leave before he returns. Charlie and Sophie try to convince her but she hears the sounds of hooves and watches as HER Lorenzo (Franco Nero) shows up on horseback. His son and grandson tell him her name and it's clear that he remembers her very well and they embrace while Charlie and Sophie look on.Lorenzo invites them all for dinner and they visit and catch up while Charlie and Sophie try not to look at each other at the table. Lorenzo reveals that he lost his wife, Rose, just as Claire has lost Jack, her husband, but that Destiny must have wanted them to get together, and he thanks Sophie for making it all happen. Sophie is uncomfortable being around Charlie and asks Lorenzo for a ride from one of his sons back to Verona. Charlie looks on in disbelief as she leaves and his grandmother asks what he's waiting for, and how many Sophies does he think he'll meet? He drives back to Verona meaning to confront her about his feelings for her, and sees her on the balcony hugging Victor who is happy to see her. He decides that he can't ruin her happiness and he drives away, missing the fact that Victor gets interrupted by a phone call again and walks away from Sophie who looks miserable.Back in New York Sophie is showing her story about the letter to her boss who is enthralled and wants to know what happened next. Sophie says sadly that she didn't stay in touch. She asks what her boss thinks and he tells her to buy stock in the Italian Airlines because of the number of women who will be flocking to Verona. Sophie is overjoyed that he's printing her story and he asks her if she has any more for him. She is on her way out to lunch with her friend to celebrate when she is handed her messages and mail by the receptionist. She has received a wedding invitation from Claire and Lorenzo, for their wedding that weekend in Sienna, and Claire has included the letter that Sophie found that started it all.Sophie heads to the restaurant where she proceeds to tell Victor that she will be going to the wedding, but alone. He tries to protest but she breaks off things with him and heads home to pack for her journey, leaving him alone with his kitchen.She arrives at the wedding looking for Charlie and surprises him that she came. He looks very happy to see her and she starts to tell him why she's there when she's interrupted by a woman named Patricia, who Sophie believes is his date. She heads inside and watches as Lorenzo marries Claire. As they are enjoying the reception Sophie is struggling not to cry while watching Charlie, then Claire interrupts and asks if she can read aloud the response that Sophie sent to her. The letter is wonderfully written and centers around the words What If and encourages her to follow her dreams. Everyone applauds the letter and Sophie smiles and excuses herself from the reception. Charlie notices that she's upset and follows her. He chases her behind the building but she seems to have disappeared, but she appears on a balcony above him. She tearfully tells him that she broke up with Victor because she's in love with him but that since he's with Patricia now she wishes him well. Charlie interrupts saying that Patricia is his cousin, not his date and proceeds to climb up to the balcony to Sophie, telling her that he's in love with her too. He asks her where she wants to live and talks about how London is wonderful and he can make her happy there but if she wants to live in New York then he will be more than happy moving there so long as he can be with her. She agrees and as he's leaning in to kiss her the vine he's climbing snaps and he falls to the ground. Sophie rushes to him and asks if he's ok, and he asks her if anyone saw him fall. She looks up to see the whole wedding party looking on but lies and tells him 'No' as she kisses him.~Beth~"

James insults Zabel by offering to buy Keller Zabel stock at $3 a share (against its $75 trading value from a week prior).The next morning, Zabel wakes up and kisses his wife after breakfast. He goes to a news stand and picks up a bag of Lays chips and a newspaper. As the train pulls in, Zabel pushes towards the front of the line and jumps on the tracks.Jake hears the news on the television of Zabel's suicide as Winnie returns from her trip. She hugs him and consoles him before he proposes to her. She agrees to marry him.A few weeks later, Jake attends a lecture at Fordham University given by Gordon Gekko and hears what Gekko has to say about the current financial crisis. Gekko reveals that in his opinion the unrestrained speculation will cause a financial cataclysm, even though everybody is euphoric about the current financial bubble. After the lecture ends, Jake approaches Gekko and tells him that he's about to marry Winnie. They ride a subway train together and Gekko explains that his daughter won't speak to him because of her brother Rudy's suicide a few years prior over Gekko's imprisonment and social shunning over his father. Jake sees that Gekko has a photo of Winnie as a toddler and asks if he can have it. Gekko tells him that he will trade Jake for a more recent photograph of Winnie. Gekko gives him the photo and his card so that Jake will find him later on. He also tells Jake that Keller Zabel was in trouble the minute someone started rumors about them and that Jake should look for whoever profited from Keller Zabel's collapse. From now on, Gekko and Jake agree to make a ""trade"", so that Jake would enable Gekko to communicate with his estranged daughter, and, in return, Gekko would help Jake collect secret information to destroy Bretton, who ruined Jake's mentor. Thus Gekko reveals his characteristic philosophy of life, where every deal that he makes in return for something is nothing but a trade.With the help of Gekko, who is very resourceful, Jake does some digging and realizes that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse. In order to get his attention, Jake spreads false rumors about the nationalization of an African oil rig that Bretton's company owns. The company loses $120 million and Bretton asks for a meeting with Jake. At the meeting, he tells Jake that he is impressed and offers Jake a job, making it clear that if Jake doesn't accept he will have a lot of trouble being hired anywhere else. Determined to take Bretton out and avenge Zabel, Jake accepts.Winnie and Jake go out to Long Island to meet with Jake's mother (Susan Sarandon), a real estate agent in financial trouble. She asks for $200,000 to float her properties. Jake gives it to her but Winnie tells Jake in private that she's only going to waste her chance again. She asks him to take her very expensive ring back because she isn't comfortable wearing something so expensive.Jake pretends that he called Gekko to have dinner and ask his approval so he and Winnie go to have dinner with him. During their re-introductions, Gekko sees an important business man and introduces himself, only to be brushed off as a nobody. Winnie realizes that Gekko hasn't changed his greedy ways and leaves the restaurant upset. Jake pursues her and she tells him that if he goes back, Gekko will destroy them.A few days later, Jake visits Gekko again at his apartment and gives him the photo of Winnie that he promised. Gekko tells Jake that his research pointed out that the Locust Fund, a private offshore hedge fund was betting against Keller Zabel. Jake explains that he was offered a job by Bretton James and Gekko tells Jake that he suspects it was James's testimony which got him sent away for eight years (more time than a murderer). Jake is confused, having assumed that it was Bud Fox who put Gekko after Fox's 1985-1986 insider trading trial. Gekko explains that Bud Fox got him on insider trading but that was nothing compared to some of Gekko's other activities that he was convicted of. He and Bretton had a falling out back in 1988 and, though he doesn't know for sure, he suspects that Bretton was behind it. Gekko asks for another trade: he wants to have a face to face with his daughter.At work, Jake is put on the sideline so that Bretton's point woman can take over a pitch to the Chinese businessmen. They are unimpressed with her pitch, stating that they are looking for the next big thing in energy. Jake swoops in and presents them with the fusion research he has been supporting. Bretton is impressed by Jake's initiative and is glad that the firm has made more money. However, the firm is in trouble but Bretton doesn't want anyone to know. The economy is slowly starting to crumble. Bretton hosts a fundraiser and invites Jake and Winnie. Gekko asks Jake to front him $10,000 so that Gekko can also attend and have another chance to reconcile with Winnie.Wandering around the party, Gekko ends up bumping into Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen, in a suprise cameo). Apparelty Fox did his time in prison and went on to build Bluestar Airline into one of the premier airlines in the country after his father's retirement and death. Fox sold the company and retired a multi-millionaire. He wishes Gekko well and tells him to stay out of trouble.Gekko approaches Winnie and Jake at Bretton's table but Winnie leaves when Gekko arrives. Gekko and Bretton exchange a tense conversation where Gekko implies that he has proof that Bretton is responsible for putting him away. Bretton gets uncomfortable but points out that Gekko is no one. Gekko leaves him to find Winnie. Bretton tells Jake that the Chinese are going to invest $150 million in the fusion research Jake has been supporting.Outside of the building, Gekko finds Winnie outside on the steps and they have an intense conversation. He tells her that she's all he has and she's his gal until the day that he dies. She hugs him and Jake watches them have their moment. Jake calls the head researcher and tells him that the money is on its way.Over the next few months, the USA economy collapses. The stock market loses billions during September-October 2008.Jake is at his apartment and tells Winnie that the world as they know it is over. Winnie tells him that is unacceptable because she is pregnant. Jake is floored but excitedly happy and kisses her.Numerous companies around the country are failing. Bretton calls Jake into his office and Jake takes a helicopter to meet Bretton at his estate in upstate New York. The two participate in a motorcycle race against each other and Jake beats Bretton. Bretton tells Jake that the money the Chinese invested is going into fossil fuels instead of fusion research. Jake gets angry knowing that Bretton is trying to sink the fusion research since it is not profitable, even though it would benefit the entire world. Bretton would be unable to control the source once the technology becomes known, unlike with the oil industry. Jake quits and tells Bretton to go fuck himself.Jake tells Gekko about what happened and Gekko reveals that there is a solution: Winnie has a trust fund account in Switzerland with $100 million which Gekko set up in the 1980s when she was born. He told her that once he was out of jail, he would need that money to reassert himself but Winnie reneged when Rudy died. While she has always considered giving it to charity, she hasn't. Jake could use that money to fund the research and save the company. But since Winnie never declared it, she could go to jail for tax evasion. Gekko tells Jake that he can embezzle it with his old contacts. Jake believes him and goes to talk to Winnie.At Winnie's office, Jake asks why she never mentioned the money. Winnie is shocked that he knows but Jake gets enthusiastic about the fusion research and tells her that this is her chance to make a difference. She agrees and the two fly to Switzerland. She signs the money over to Jake. Jake then entrusts the money to Gekko so that he can legitimize the funds for the investment in the fusion research company.A few hours after returning to New York, Jake gets a call saying that the money never arrived. He gets frantic but his mother interrupts him before he goes to deal with Gekko. She asks for $100,000 because of the collapse of the housing industry, but Jake gives her $30,000 and tells her that he cannot afford to waste any more money on her ridiculous real estate deals. He goes to Gekko's apartment and finds it empty: he's gone.Jake tells Winnie what happened and that he's been talking to Gekko for a while. She breaks off their engagement and tells Jake to leave: she no longer trusts him or feels safe around him. He leaves bitterly and tracks Gekko to England, where Gekko is running a financial company again with the $100 million he stole from Winnie and Jake. Jake propositions him for one last trade: Winnie gets her $100 million back and Gekko gets a grandson. Jake shows him the ultrasound of his son but Gekko, despite being moved, cannot let go of being someone of importance. He tells him that its not about money; its about the game. Gekko says that giving the money away is a ""trade he cannot make."" Jake leaves.Over the next few weeks, by using the previous information collected by Gekko about Bretton, Jake begins piecing together everything from Keller Zabels collapse to the economic bailouts being issued for Brettons company. Jake points out that Bretton owns the Locust Fund (www.locustfund.com) and puts the pieces together in one large information packet. He gives it to Winnie, telling her that it will put her website on the map for good as a legitimate source of information and that he misses her like crazy. He then leaves.Winnie runs the story and Bretton James is exposed. The board of directors kicks him out of the company and Bretton is forced to testify to his crimes in front of the Congressional Committee, who note that they previously had Brettons cooperation in the Gekko investigation. Bretton's career is over and he's left to the sharks. Bretton's board of directors, led by the elderly banker Julius Scherhart (Eli Wallach) goes to Gekko in order to start doing business with him in view of the new credibility Gekko gained through his London firm's astounding success. He speaks to his materialistic business clients in the language they understand and respect: by correctly predicting the coming financial collapse, Gekko sold the market short and turned the 100 million that he stole from his daughter into the incredible sum of $1 billion dollars. He proudly looks at his account assets; Gekko is a billionaire again.Jake sees the very pregnant Winnie walking to her apartment and helps her carry her things. Their son has been kicking and keeping her up at night. Jake feels his sons kicks and Winnie thanks him for the help but they do not reconcile. Gordon appears and tells them that he deposited the $100 million in to the fusion researchers account anonymously. Now that Gekko attained his aim of becoming a billionaire by using the money he stole from his daughter, he finally returns that relatively small sum. He tells them that they make a good couple and that hed like to be there for them as their father and a grandfather. He walks away saying, ""What? Can't you believe in a comeback?""Jake kisses Winnie and they reconcile before the birth and, one year later, they celebrate their son's first birthday with a party, at which Gordon Gekko is also present."
Predators,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1424381/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of elite warriors parachute into an unfamiliar jungle and are hunted by members of a merciless alien race. When a group of people find themselves in a jungle, they realize that they are on a completely different planet and it's home to a race of extraterrestrial hunters. The group consists of a mercenary known as Royce, an IDF sniper known as Isabelle, a Russian Spetsnaz known as Nikolai, a drug cartel enforcer known as Cuchillo, an RUF officer known as Mombasa, a death row inmate known as Stans, a Yakuza assassin known as Hanzo, and an American doctor known as Edwin. It's up to these 8 individuals to stop their hunters and get off the planet. Decades have passed since the first sighting of the nearly invisible extraterrestrial hunter inPredator (1987)and the urban massacre inPredator 2 (1990). But now, a hand-picked team of the world's eight most dangerous killers finds itself stranded on a mysterious terraformed planet, trapped in the heart of a dense alien jungle. As the unseen hunters of the pitiless but honourable race of space-warriors pick them off for sport, elite mercenary Royce has no other choice but to join forces with the strangers to come up with an effective defence strategy. However, this is a bloody race against the clock. Can they escape the deadly Game Preserve Planet?—Nick Riganas A mercenary, an IDF sniper, a Russian commando, a drug cartel enforcer, an RUF officer, a death row inmate, a Yakuza enforcer and a doctor, are all abducted and placed on a planet which acts as a game reserve for two warring tribes of extraterrestrial killers. They soon realize that they are hunted and that strength lies in numbers and they all try to find a way out of the alien planet.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com The mercenary Royce; the military Isabelle; the Russian soldier Nikolai; the San Quentin criminal Stans; the Sierra Leone militia Mombasa; the drug lord Cuchillo; the Yakuza Hanzo; and the Doctor Edwin awake in free fall but they succeed to open their parachutes landing in a jungle. Soon they find that they are on another planet and they are prey of aliens in a deadly hunting game, and they need to join forces to destroy their predators and survive.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Royce (Adrien Brody) awakens from unconsciousness to find himself falling toward a rain-forest. A parachute attached to his back opens and he he makes a hard landing. Nearby he sees another man whose chute didn't open and was killed on impact. He meets several others who have arrived there in the same manner: Mexican drug cartel enforcer Cuchillo (Danny Trejo), Spetsnaz soldier Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov), Israel Defense Forces sniper Isabelle (Alice Braga), Revolutionary United Front officer Mombasa (Mahershala Ali), death row inmate Stans (Walton Goggins), Yakuza enforcer Hanzo (Louis Ozawa), and doctor Edwin (Topher Grace). None of them know where they are or how they arrived there. Royce takes charge but reveals little about himself, though Isabelle suspects that he is a mercenary and former Black Ops (black operations) soldier. He speculates that they have been brought to the jungle for a reason since with the exception of Edwin they are all armed and lethal killers. In the jungle, they find empty cages, plants with a neurotoxin poison that Edwin collects on a small scalpel, and a deceased United States Special Forces soldier who'd fortified his location with several crude animal traps. Arriving at higher ground, they find themselves staring at an alien sky and conclude that they are not on Earth. Royce says they'll need a different plan.After the party is attacked by a pack of quadrupedal alien beasts, Royce deduces that the planet is some type of game preserve and that the humans are being hunted as game. Hearing Cuchillo's cries for help, they find his dead body being used and his voice being mimicked in an attempt to bait them into a trap -- whoever killed him had laid several small rings around the body. They follow the quadrupeds' tracks to a hunting encampment and find a captive Predator. Three larger Predators attack, killing Mombasa, but the rest of the group escapes. Isabelle reveals that she has heard of these creatures before, from a report by the only survivor of a Special Forces team who encountered one in Val Verde, Guatemala in 1987.The group next meets Noland (Laurence Fishburne), an air assault soldier who has survived on the planet for years by scavenging and hiding in an abandoned structure. He explains that the Predators sharpen their killing skills by collecting warriors and dangerous beasts from other worlds and bringing them to the planet to hunt. Noland also reveals that there is even a blood feud between the larger Predators and the smaller ones. Royce hopes that if they free the smaller Predator being held prisoner in the encampment, it might be able to take them home using the other Predators' spaceship. Noland attempts to murder the group during the night, but Royce creates noise to attract the Predators, who kill Noland. In the ensuing chase, Nikolai sacrifices himself to kill one of the Predators, using an explosive. Stans is killed by a second Predator, which Hanzo then succeeds in killing in a samurai-like sword fight at the cost of his own life.Edwin is injured by a ring trap as he, Royce, and Isabelle head for the encampment. When Isabelle refuses to abandon him, Royce leaves them both behind, and they are caught by the third and final large Predator. Royce frees the smaller Predator and heads for the ship as the two Predators confront each other. The larger Predator kills its foe and then destroys the ship as it takes off. Meanwhile, Edwin, trapped in a pit
with Isabelle, paralyzes her with the neurotoxin poison on his scalpel and reveals that on Earth he was a psychopathic murderer, and feels that he fits in on this planet among the monsters. Royce appears, never having boarded the ship, and saves Isabelle by stabbing Edwin through the throat.Royce booby-traps Edwin's body with grenades, using him as bait to disorient the Predator. He uses the fire to hide his heat signature, and a violent fight ensues. While Royce is hiding behind a tree to figure out a new strategy, the Predator changes his point of view from heat signal, to tracking Royce's heartbeat. Right away, the Predator finds Royce behind a tree and attacks him. Just when Royce is about to be given a death blow from the Predator, Isabelle drags her body towards her sniper's rifle and shoots the Predator. Royce is able to regain his feet and successfully decapitate the Predator with a crude axe. As Royce and Isabelle recover from their ordeal, they observe more prey being dropped into the jungle. Royce declares that they must find another way off of the planet."
Hot Tub Time Machine,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1231587/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A malfunctioning time machine at a ski resort takes a man back to 1986 with his two friends and nephew, where they must relive a fateful night and not change anything to make sure the nephew is born. Three friends on losing streaks: Adam, whose girlfriend dumped him, Nick, with a dead-end job and a cheating wife, and Lou, a suicidal alcoholic. To help Lou recover from car-exhaust poisoning, Adam and Nick, with Adam's nephew Jacob, go to a winter resort that was their old party place. It's now a dump, but the lads rally for a night of drinking in the hot tub. Somehow, the hot tub takes them back to 1986, on a fateful night for each of them. Maybe if they do everything the same way they did that night, they'll get back to the future so Jacob can be born. There are serious temptations to do things differently. Will they make it back to their sorry lives? And what about Jacob?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Forty-somethings Adam Yates, Nick Webber and Lou Dorchen have been friends since they were teenagers, and even though they have each other's contact information, they, as adults, don't like to associate with each other now, and often ignore especially Lou's attempts to keep in touch. Their lives haven't turned out very well. Adam, who wants to be in love, has just been acrimoniously dumped by the latest in a long string of girlfriends. His twenty-three year old nephew, Jacob, lives in his basement since Jacob's single mother, Adam's sister Kelly, is a deadbeat. Nick once had a promising musical career, but gave that up for his wife Courtney, who rules the family. Nick now works in a dead end job in a doggie spa. And Lou lives a reckless life as an overgrown adolescent. Because of an accident which almost takes Lou's life - which the authorities believe was an attempted suicide despite Lou's denials - Adam, Nick and Jacob decide to treat Lou to a vacation weekend to Kodiak Valley, a ski resort the three friends often frequented during happier times in their life. The resort has seen better days. But they're happy that they manage to get the same hotel room they had twenty-four years earlier during Winterfest '86. After taking a dip in the hot tub in their room, they miraculously awaken back to that Winterfest with all the knowledge of their adult lives. The one person who seems to know what's going on is the hot tub maintenance man, who implies that they have to recreate their lives on that 1986 Winterfest vacation so as not to upset the future before they can be sent forward to the present. That premonition is most important to Jacob, who believes that any change to their structure will result in him not being born. But Adam, Nick and Lou have problems adhering to many of the less pleasant incidents of that vacation. But if adhering to what they did in 1986 won't change the future, they may come to the realization that making certain changes may result in a better life for themselves than the first time around, the consequences be damned.—Huggo In 2010, three friends are dissatisfied with their lives. Adam (John Cusack) has been dumped by yet another girlfriend, and his video-game-obsessed nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) lives in his basement. Lou (Rob Corddry) is a party guy way past his prime who is divorced and his family wants nothing to do with him. Lou has also failed in several investments and is debt-ridden as a result. Nick (Craig Robinson) has a dead-end job at a dog spa and a controlling wife named Courtney (Kellee Stewart) who is allegedly having an affair.Lou almost dies from carbon monoxide poisoning in what his friends think is a suicide attempt. Adam and Nick impulsively take him and Jacob to the site of some of their most memorable weekends, the Kodiak Valley Ski Resort, ""where no one got carded and everyone got laid"". However, upon arrival they see that Kodiak Valley has fallen on the same hard times as the four men. Upon arriving, they encounter Phil, a one-armed bellman (Crispin Glover). During a crazy night of drinking in a hot tub, they spill a can of an illegal Russian energy drink called ""Chernobly"" (named in reference to Chernobyl, Ukraine) on the hot tub's controls. The next day, they wake up in 1986. They can see each other as their 2010 age and appearances, but in their reflections and to other people, they appear as they did in 1986. Jacob, who has not even been born yet, somehow is still a full-grown man as he was in his 2010 state. They arrive during ""Winterfest '86,"" the weekend when Poison played to a huge crowd at the then-thriving Kodiak Resort. At first, the guys do not think that they have traveled back in time but are convinced when they find out that Michael Jackson is still black, and discover that Phil, the bellman has both arms.It is a time that was hard on the group. Adam broke up with his first girlfriend and got stabbed in the eye with a fork. Adam's sister, Kelly, conceived Jacob with an unknown father. Lou was beaten up by Blaine, the ski patrol bully, and none of his friends came to his aid. Nick's show ended in disaster with his band at an open mic contest. The four are at first concerned that if they change even the slightest thing in this time, it could have drastic consequences in the future (based on a tenuous understanding of the Ray Bradbury short story, ""A Sound of Thunder""), they set out to do exactly what they did 24 years ago. Believing he must do everything the same as before, Nick has sex with a girl named Tara (Jessica Paré), but feels extremely guilty over being unfaithful to Courtney as his marriage to her occurred before the time travel. Later, they decide that this may be a chance to change their destinies. When Jacob begins to flicker in and out of existence, he warns the guys that if they continue what they're doing, then he may be wiped out of existence. A mysterious hot tub repairman (Chevy Chase) informs Jacob that the key to their time travel was the Chernobly, which contains chemicals that are vital to the time travel process. However, the Chernobly is in Lou's backpack, which was stolen by Blaine's gang.Nick calls Courtney (his future wife who is actually 9 years old when he calls) and yells at her about the evils of adultery. Courtney's father interrupts the conversation and Adam and Jacob stop Nick from telling him that Courtney is his bride-to-be. Adam's girlfriend, Jenny (Lyndsy Fonseca), dumps him before he can dump her (and he still gets stabbed by her, but in the forehead with a plastic fork), but he ends up spending the night with a music journalist, April (Lizzy Caplan). With Lou's encouragement, Nick & his band rock the crowd with performances of early-1980s hit ""Jesse's Girl"" and early-2000s hit ""Let's Get It Started"" - which he introduces as ""a song from the future"" that the audience gets to hear since this time (unlike last time) they were very receptive to his band's performance. Lou is beaten up by Blaine (Sebastian Stan), but finds the courage to punch him back, and all three of Lou's friends appear to confront Blaine's henchmen and recapture the Chernobly. Lou also seduces Kelly (Collette Wolfe) and conceives Jacob, solving the mystery of who Jacob's true father was. Also throughout the course of the time, they witness Phil almost get his arm taken off by a chainsaw and get stuck in the elevator shaft, but are disappointed when the arm doesn't become amputated, but as they are about to leave, Phil does lose his arm after being struck by a snowplow.The guys are set to go back to 2010, but, just as the hot tub starts to activate, Lou decides to remain in 1986, admitting to Adam that he was indeed trying to kill himself, and that if he goes back it will happen all over again. He says he wants to use his knowledge of future history to make investments, and do right by Kelly and Jacob. Adam says that if Lou is staying, so is he but Lou pushes Adam into the hot tub, just as it blasts the guys back into 2010. The gang arrives back in 2010 to find that Phil's arms are still in tact. Phil says that after the gang left, Blaine and his group managed to save his severed arm by putting it on ice and taking him to a nearby hospital to have it re-attached.Adam, Nick, and Jacob discover that Lou, Kelly, and Jacob are now a happy family enjoying a lavish lifestyle. Lou has become a successful rock star with his favorite band, ""Mötley Loue"" and is the founder of an Internet search engine called ""Lougle"". Adam discovers that he eventually married April, and Nick is a successful music producer married to a loyal and supportive Courtney. She tells him about a wrong number phone call she got when she was 9, that was enough to keep her from trying to cheat on anybody. Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob reunite at Lou's mansion with their families, satisfied with their new lives."
Kick-Ass,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan who one day decides to become a superhero, even though he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so. Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan with a few friends and who lives alone with his father. His life is not very difficult and his personal trials not that overwhelming; however, one day he makes the simple decision to become a super-hero, even though he has no powers or training.—Daniel J. Leary Dave Lizewski opens the film with a voiceover narration about how superheroes came into existence. A man in a superhero costume stands on a skyscraper above a crowd, ready to show the world his new flight suit. He jumps, as people cheer, before crashing into a taxi and dying. Dave comments that the man isn't him; just a delusional mental patient. He introduces himself as 'Kick -Ass' and starts telling the story of his life.He begins six months earlier. Dave is a social misfit, a real, natural-born geek, a true nobody at his high school, invisible to all the girls. He has two good friends, Todd and Marty, and they spend most of their time at the local comic book store. When Dave was 14, his mother died suddenly of an aneurysm and that's when he noticed that, even when things change, they simply stay the same. He is in love with Katie Deauxma but she barely notices him. A genuinely nice guy, he tries to reach out to people, including Chris D'Amico, the spoiled but lonely son of a local mobster; however, this plan fails miserably. When he attempts to casually talk to Chris, Chris's bodyguard scares Dave away, because Chris is not allowed to have friends. One day, following a conversation about superheroes at the comic book café, Dave and Todd are robbed by a pair of street gang members. This event inspires Dave to become a superhero and fight crime. He orders a green-colored diving suit off the internet, fits two batons to the back, and starts training to become a crime fighter.After a few weeks of physical training, Dave sees the two men who robbed him and Todd trying to break into a car. Dave dons his suit and confronts them, which leads to a fight. It ends with Dave brutally stabbed and the robbers running off. Dave stumbles away only to be hit by a car, which quickly drives off. An ambulance shortly arrives and rushes Dave to the hospital. En route, though clinging to life, Dave begs the paramedic to hide his suit. Dave is brought to the hospital naked, which starts rumors about the circumstances that led to his admittance - one heavily implied to be related to gay prostitution.A few months later, Dave is almost as good as new. His injuries leave him with metal plating covering most of his skull and interior, and a higher threshold for pain thanks to frayed nerve endings. He returns to school and is shocked when Katie begins talking to him. Marty explains that she likes 'lame ducks' and tells Dave that the entire school thinks he's a gay prostitute. Though he is at first horrified by this, Dave comes to accept his new social standing, seeing it as the only way to be close to Katie. Despite the setbacks his debilitating fight caused, Dave is still determined to be a superhero and sets up a MySpace account for his alter ego: Kick-Ass.One night, while looking for a lost cat, Dave notices three men viciously attacking a fourth man in front of a diner. Immediately, Dave rushes to the man's aid and successfully beats off the attackers, his metal plating and inability to feel pain providing an advantage. Some patrons from the diner record the fight along with Dave's formal introduction of his alter ego and post it on YouTube. Kick-Ass becomes an internet phenomenon and is quickly circulated throughout the media. Chris watches the latest reports with his parents, Frank D'Amico and Angie, as his father criticizes Kick-Ass's apparent lack of skill.Across town, Frank's thugs torture one of his associates, who claims that a man resembling Batman attacked their cocaine dealers and stole all of their drugs. Thinking it far more likely that the associate stole the cocaine for a profit, Frank has him tortured and killed before taking his son Chris out to the movies. Frank surrounds himself with a posse of thugs/bodyguards wherever he goes, for both intimidation and to protect himself from family members of rivals and people he's killed. Later on, Frank learns that his earlier assumption about his missing shipment was incorrect, so he sends his men to take care of a Russian mobster whom he believes is really responsible for messing with his shipments.The next morning, ex-policeman Damon MacReady points a gun at his 11-year-old daughter, Mindy, and shoots her in the chest. Mindy stands up, shocked by the force of the bullet but impressed with how effectively her bullet-proof vest absorbed it. They watch the reports on Kick-Ass. Damon is not impressed and sees Kick-Ass as a wannabe rookie, but Mindy thinks he has potential. Framed as a drug dealer by Frank D'Amico, Damon was relieved of his duty as an officer and sent to prison for five years, which led to his wife's suicide and left Mindy in the care of Damon's partner, Marcus. Damon vowed revenge against Frank and began training to become a vigilante. Once his term was served, he was reunited with Mindy and began training her as well, against Marcus's wishes. Bent on eliminating all of D'Amico's crime syndicate, Damon captures and manipulates several members, resulting in very brutal and violent deaths. Marcus finds Damon and begs with him to end his vendetta before dirty cop Detective Gigante or D'Amico finds him. He asks to see Mindy but, seeing the futility of the attempt, leaves, telling Damon he owes Mindy a real childhood. Damon colors a large, comic book-style hit list and hangs it on the wall.As Kick-Ass, Dave continues to save people and gathers more supporters over the internet. As Katie's 'gay' best friend, he is able to get closer to her and begins to get to know her as a person. One day, she mentions that a meth addict named Rasul, who frequents the clinic she volunteers at, robbed her and smacked her around, refusing to leave her alone. Dave convinces her to message Kick-Ass. That night, Kick-Ass finds Rasul at his apartment and attempts to intimidate him, but fails. As Rasul and his gang members are about to castrate Kick-Ass, Mindy, dressed in her vigilante outfit (with a purple wig and cape), shoots through the window and fights off all the gang members with knives and a long spear until they are all dead. As a surviving gang member sneaks up behind her, Mindy's father shoots him through the head with his sniper rifle from an opposite building. She introduces herself to Kick-Ass as Hit Girl and begins stealing all of the gang members' money and guns. Kick-Ass asks what's going on and Hit Girl tells him to come with her. They go to the roof and Hit Girl jumps across the rooftops to join her father, dressed as his alter ego, Big Daddy. Kick-Ass is too afraid to follow and the other two leave disappointed. Dave returns home, removes his mask, and cries himself to sleep. He laments that he's just an incompetent, overgrown child and that there are other people better suited for his job as a superhero.That same night, Big Daddy and Hit Girl pay Dave a visit at his house. They tell him that they were able to easily back-trace his MySpace account and the three have a chat. Big Daddy tells Dave that he is doing okay but that he has potential to be better. They tell him that if he ever needs to reach them he should decorate his MySpace page with an 'On Vacation' banner and they will find a way to contact him.Meanwhile, Frank D'Amico learns that there are actual vigilantes fighting against his organization and becomes very pissed off. Chris wants to get in on the business, but Frank pushes him aside. He becomes extremely tense and paranoid, going so far as to kill a Kick-Ass imitator in broad daylight, thinking the phony to be the real thing. As more of his gang members are disposed of, Frank becomes desperate. He contacts Detective Gigante and tells him to 'take care' of Kick-Ass. Gigante admits that Kick-Ass is in a relatively gray area, but he'll do his best. Chris offers an alternative solution: let him don his own superhero alter ego called the Red Mist. As such, Chris will frame one of D'Amico's incompetent associates and trick Kick-Ass into trusting him before leading him into an ambush.Chris executes his plan while Dave becomes more and more discouraged. As Red Mist, Chris makes contact with Kick-Ass and requests to become his sidekick, since Kick-Ass is the one who inspired him. Red Mist shows Kick-Ass his flashy sportscar and they drive off to the D'Amico stronghold, only to see it burning to the ground. Kick-Ass rushes inside to see if he can save anyone but everyone inside is dead, horribly cut and burned. Red Mist grabs a teddy bear from the wall and runs out of the building with Kick-Ass as it explodes. The two part ways and Kick-Ass resolves to give up crime fighting. He goes to Katie's house with the intention of revealing his identity. She sprays mace in his face, calling him a pervert, until he de-masks. Dave confesses his alter ego and tells Katie that he isn't really gay and he loves her. She forgives him and they begin dating and start having sex. Todd and Marty are left to hang out with a friend of Katie's.Meanwhile, Frank D'Amico has seen the destruction of his warehouse and worries for his son until Chris arrives and tells him that Kick-Ass isn't the real threat. He shows Frank the teddy bear which has a Nanny Cam in it. They watch footage of Big Daddy killing all of D'Amico's men and burning the warehouse to the ground. D'Amico convinces Chris to set up a trap to catch Big Daddy.Dave, having been Kick-Ass free for a week, sees a series of emails from Red Mist requesting his help and decides to go on one last mission. He tells Katie what he is doing and leaves to meet up with Red Mist, who tells him that they have a bounty on their heads. Concerned for his allies, Kick-Ass contacts Big Daddy through his MySpace page. Damon and Mindy notice the urgent message while enjoying some hot chocolate and reviewing their latest cache of weaponry. They respond to Kick-Ass and instruct him to meet them at one of their safe houses. Red Mist drives Kick-Ass to the location, followed by D'Amico's men. At the safe house, Red Mist and Kick-Ass are ushered inside by Big Daddy as Hit Girl waits beside a window. Inside, Red Mist pulls a gun and shoots Hit Girl twice in the chest. As she falls out of the window, Big Daddy screams and D'Amico's men rush in, beating him and Kick-Ass unconscious. As they put them in the back of a waiting van, Red Mist screams for them to let Kick-Ass go since he considers him a friend and doesn't want to see him hurt. One of the bodyguards takes Big Daddy's bazooka as a reward and drags Red Mist home to his father. Chris complains to his father that his men reneged on the deal by taking Kick-Ass along with Big Daddy. but Frank tells him to shut up and watch what happens next. He explains that Big Daddy is a nobody, important only to him for the sake of his business, but by killing Kick-Ass, he sends a message to all the punks out there considering to becoming superheroes. Chris can only watch.A countdown is announced for the unmasking of Kick-Ass and all of New York City bears witness. Katie is proud of Dave but watches with horror as a live video feed on the internet shows Big Daddy and Kick-Ass handcuffed to chairs awaiting torture and execution. Marcus also watches solemnly as D'Amico's men begin to brutally beat the two. They pour gasoline over Big Daddy as Hit Girl, very much alive, sneaks into the hideout. She attacks and kills all of the men inside, but one of them manages to set Big Daddy on fire, burning him severely. Hit Girl extinguishes her father too late and shares one last moment with him before he dies in her arms. Hit Girl rescues Kick-Ass and takes him back to her father's apartment. There, Dave tries to tell her that it's all over now and they should give up their vigilante lifestyles, but Mindy is adamant about finishing what her father started, adding her own fury to avenge her father's death. Realizing that he is responsible for all that's happened, Dave agrees to help her. He takes up a mysterious piece of weaponry that Big Daddy had bought and assembled.At Frank D'Amico's headquarters, his men are on double alert waiting for Kick-Ass and Hit Girl to show up. In the lobby, the first guards are standing idly on duty when Mindy knocks on the front door, dressed in a school girl outfit. The doorman and guards, having never seen Mindy's face before, open the door to let her in. She tearfully says she can't find her parents, so the doorman offers her his phone to call them. As he kneels down, Mindy stuffs the barrel of a handgun into his mouth. The guards realize this too late and Mindy takes them all out with ease. She changes into her Hit Girl guise and arrives at the penthouse, fighting with speed and stealth and killing more of D'Amico's men. When she runs out of bullets, she resorts to throwing knives. A large thug runs to get the bazooka, much to the shock and disgust of both Frank and Chris, while the other thugs pin Hit Girl behind a counter. The large thug returns with the bazooka as they all hear a mechanic sound near the windows. They look outside to see Kick-Ass hovering upwards with a jet-pack strapped to his back and attached rapid-fire mini guns protruding over each shoulder. Kick-Ass quickly disposes of the rest of the thugs.In Frank's office, he and Chris hear the final sounds of the fire fight and think that the thugs were successful, but Hit Girl and Kick-Ass barge through the door, ready for the final showdown. Frank orders Chris to take on Kick-Ass. Chris is disgruntled but rushes into battle while Frank squares off against Hit Girl.Kick-Ass and Red Mist face off in an adjacent dojo and knock each other out cold. Hit Girl battles Frank with ferocity but finds that she has met her match, since Frank is highly trained in martial arts. Frank's attacks become increasingly ruthless and he beats Hit Girl near to a pulp and slams her through a coffee table. He retrieves his gun and prepares to kill her when Kick-Ass appears, suggesting he 'pick on someone his own size'. Frank redirects his gun only to see that Kick-Ass is holding the bazooka. Kick-Ass fires, sending the rocket into Frank and out the window, killing Frank.Chris comes to and draws a katana, looking for a rematch, but finds Kick-Ass activating the jet-pack and flying off with Hit Girl. They land on a distant rooftop and Kick-Ass unstraps the pack and sets both Hit Girl and the pack down. Hit Girl thanks him for the help, saying Big Daddy would be proud of them both. Kick-Ass takes off his mask and tells her his real name, Dave Lizewski. Hit Girl consents to the gesture and takes off her wig and mask, showing him her face, and telling him her true name, Mindy MacReady. They shake hands and look toward the horizon.A voice-over from Dave tells us that Marcus regains guardianship of Mindy and that she is now enrolled at Dave's school, on the promise that Dave will look out for her...not that she'd need it as Dave says. An amusing scene shows two school bullies attempting to shake the 'new kid' for her lunch money but she merely smiles, cracks her knuckles and beats up the two bullies. Dave relaxes with his friends at a coffee shop as his voice-over mentions that Kick-Ass has become a cultural sensation with his own comic strip. While Dave has retired from crime fighting, there is a whole new wave of people inspired to follow in his footsteps.One, however, is equally determined to break the new superhero wave down. Chris, as the Red Mist, sits in his father's office donning a revamped costume and mask, vowing revenge against Kick-Ass, Hit Girl, and any superhero wannabe that gets in his way. He aims his gun at the camera and fires and the screen goes black as the credits roll."
Killers,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1103153/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A vacationing woman meets her ideal man, leading to a swift marriage. Back at home, however, their idyllic life is upset when they discover their neighbors could be assassins who have been contracted to kill the couple. Spencer Aimes is just your average, undercover, government-hired super-assassin accustomed to a life of exotic European locales, flashy sports cars and even flashier women. But when he meets Jen Kornfeldt, a beautiful, fun-loving computer tech recovering from a bad break-up, he finds true love...and happily trades international intrigue for domestic bliss. Three years later, Spencer and Jen are still enjoying a picture-perfect marriage - that is, until the morning after Spencer's 30th birthday. That's when Spencer and Jen learn he's the target of a multi-million dollar hit. Even worse, the hired killers have been stalking the happy couple for years, and could be anyone: friends, neighbors, the grocery store clerk, even that crabby old guy shuffling across the street. Now Spencer and Jen are on the run for their lives. As their suburban paradise turns into a paranoid game of dodge-the-bullet, they must find out who wants Spencer dead and why, all the while trying to save their marriage, manage his in-laws, keep up neighborly appearances ... and just plain survive.—Lionsgate After a break-up with a spontaneous boyfriend, an overly cautious Jennifer ""Jen"" Kornfeldt (Katherine Heigl) travels to Nice with her parents (Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara). While going into an elevator to go to her hotel room, she meets Spencer Aimes (Ashton Kutcher). Spencer asks her to dinner and she accepts. The scene then changes to Spencer sneaking onto a boat, putting a cellphone-triggered bomb on the bottom of a helicopter, then taking out a guard. He then swims back and goes on the date with Jen.After a night of drinking, Jen reveals that she's not the spontaneous person she's been pretending to be and in return Spencer bluntly tells her that he's an assassin, albeit unhappy about being one. Unfortunately she's already passed out and hasn't heard. In spite of this, Spencer decides that Jen's the woman he's been looking for and decides to marry her. When Spencer tells his boss, Holbrook (Martin Mull), his plan, the response is that quitting is not an option. Spencer is defiant and goes ahead with his plan.Three years later, they are settled into their new normal life. After Spencer surprises Jen with a remodeled office, she gives him a birthday surprise: tickets to Nice to celebrate his birthday and their three years. Because of his dubious connections to Nice, Spencer is less than enthusiastic. When her friends ask about his reaction, they take it as signs of that he might be getting bored and fill her head with doubts.Meanwhile, Spencer gets a postcard from his old boss and the ultimatum to take another assignment. While trying to refuse him long distance, Jen's father shows up to take Spencer to dinner, so Spencer hangs up the phone, prompting suspicion in Mr. Kornfeldt. This is fueled further when Jen's dad sees the postcard and quizzes him about the XOXX (hugs and kisses), being odd coming from a former boss. Stopping home to change, Spencer finds that the dinner invitation is just a detour to bring him to a surprise party. While Spencer navigates drunken friends, Jen's friends continue to fill her head with doubts over Spencer's lack of enthusiasm for the Nice trip. This is further irritated, when the following morning, despite her attempts to be physical with him, Spencer rushes Jen off on her business trip.A little while later, Jen comes back (without having gone on her trip) to find Spencer being tossed around their house by Henry (Rob Riggle), Spencer's friend and co-worker. Spencer screams for her to get his gun (of which she was unaware) and she shoots the attacker in the arm. While interrogating the attacker, he reveals that there is a $20 million bounty on Spencer's head. An unidentified sniper takes shots at them, and Spencer and Jen flee. After escaping, they go to a hotel room where Spencer's old boss is staying, but find that someone has already killed him. Jen demands that they go to her dad for help, but Spencer disagrees. In the middle of their argument Jen vomits, and declares that she might be pregnant.Heading back to his office for Jen to take a pregnancy test, Spencer is attacked by his secretary (Katheryn Winnick) and realizes that there are others who know about the contract. Jen then reveals that she is pregnant and is leaving Spencer. Left alone, Spencer is attacked by a UDE driver, who is killed by Olivia (Lisa Ann Walter), Henry's wife and another killer vying for the contract. She then attacks Spencer and is killed by an explosion, after Jen rams her car. The two discuss their possible future and return to their neighborhood, which is holding its annual block party. When they first arrive they are attacked by two assailants. They escape and head to the block party. As they walk through the block party they receive many suspicious looks from neighbors. They enter their house to retrieve guns and their passports. Spencer is grabbing the guns when he is attacked by two assassins who he eventually kills.Meanwhile, one assassin, Kristen (Casey Wilson), one of Jen's best friends, holds Jen's mother as a hostage in a Mexican standoff with Jen. Jen's father arrives and kills Kristen. He then explains that he was the one who put out the bounty on Spencer. He knew of Spencer's previous work, and hired the neighbors and co-workers three years before in case Spencer started working for his old boss again, who Jen's father says had ""gone dirty."" After seeing the postcard from Holbrook in Spencer's office, he came to the conclusion that Spencer had re-accepted his old job and activated the assassins. He reveals that he had been an operative as well, and that he was actually the target Spencer was supposed to kill in Nice three years earlier.Wanting to prove that he really did get out of the business and had no desire to kill her father, Spencer drops his gun. Jen, now convinced, turns on her father and reveals her pregnancy. Realizing that he will be a grandfather, Jen's father also puts down his gun and the family makes peace.

Saw 3D,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477076/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As a deadly battle rages over Jigsaw's brutal legacy, a group of Jigsaw survivors gathers to seek the support of self-help guru and fellow survivor Bobby Dagen, a man whose own dark secrets unleash a new wave of terror. After trying to kill Mark Hoffman, Jill Tuck goes into protective custody. Detective Matt Gibson agrees to take her into protective custody once she signs an affidavit, revealing that Mark Hoffman is the new Jigsaw Killer. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a self-proclaimed Jigsaw Survivor, is put through his own series of tests, where he must save both his friends and his wife.—Rebekah Swain The movie opens with a glass cage which contents is in full view of confused onlookers. Two men who apparently know each other wake up chained to either end of a table saw inside the cage. Suddenly, a woman is unveiled; suspended above the two men. The puppet, ""Billy"" rides in on a trike and says they each have to decide whether the other man will die, so that the woman that has been dating both guys will live, or choose to not kill each other and let the woman die. One guy starts to push the saw to the other end, and the other guy pushes back. The woman then tells one man she loves him and the jilted man starts winning. She then tells the one who is about to 'win' that she loves him but he doesn't believe her after she had just said she had loved the other guy a moment before. Consequently, they agree to let her die instead and she is sawed in half, spewing blood out of her mouth as her intestines spill on the floor.Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) escapes from a trap which was attached to his head. He just misses a hiding Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell), and instead focuses on stitching himself up. As Jigsaw's ex-wife and with enough familiarity of Hoffman's character, Jill knows that Hoffman will not give up hunting her, and begins making her own arrangements. Heading to the police and requesting a detective not previously involved in the Jigsaw case, Gibson (Chad Donella), she tells him that she has important information and evidence that she will give up only if she gets immunity. Gibson immediately agrees.Bobby Degen (Sean Patrick Flannery) is a survivor of Jigsaw/John (Tobin Bell), and he has written a self-help book called S.U.R.V.I.V.E. which is based on his experience of escaping a Jigsaw trap. He pierced his pectoral muscles with hooks and hoisted himself into the air in order to escape. He is being interviewed and with him are his best friend Cale (Dean Armstrong), his lawyer Suzanne, his public relations woman Nina (Naomi Snieckus), and wife Joyce (Gina Holden). He and his handlers argue about how well the interview went. Nina wanted him to mention his wife so Joyce could come out on stage and he could kiss her, but Cale, Suzanne, and Joyce think it went well.Some white supremacists are at an abandoned junk yard. The driver is glued to the driver's seat. His girlfriend is chained under the car with barbed wire. His friend is bound in front of the car, and another friend is fastened to the back of the car, chains attached to his limbs and jaw. A tape plays and says that the driver and his friends are racist and they have judged people by the color of their skin: now he is going to learn that everyone is the same color on the inside. He has thirty seconds to rip himself from the seat so that he can pull a lever that will deactivate the trap. Otherwise, the car is going to fall off the jacks, crushing his girlfriend and causing a chain reaction which will kill him and the others. He tries to rip himself free and reach and gets close, but ultimately is unsuccessful. The car falls on the girlfriend, then goes forward and rips part the the friend in the rear, smashes through the man in front. The car crashes into a pile of other wrecked cars and the driver is thrown through the window, the skin on his back torn completely off.Bobby is hosting a gathering of Jigsaw survivors. Some agree that the trap experience helped them but others thought the experience left them even worse off, so Bobby gives a little pep talk meant to inspire and bring optimism. The pep talk is countered by the sarcastic clapping of a mysterious man who indirectly questions the usefulness of the meetings and hints that it is no more then promotional material for Bobby's fame. At the end of the meeting Cale asks Bobby who the ""creepy guy at the meeting with the cane"" is, Bobby reveals that the man is at the meetings all the time but that he's harmless and there is nothing to worry about. Joyce and a bodyguard heads to the car but when Bobby goes out to join them he finds the car empty. Without warning, he is suddenly attacked.When he wakes up, he is in a cage. The puppet ""Billy"" appears on a TV screen and tells Bobby that they both know his story of being a Jigsaw survivor is a hoax. Now he must be earn that status by completing a series of tasks to get to his wife, who is chained in an unknown location. First, he has to pull a handle which causes the bottom of the cage he is in to drop off. He is suspended from the cage over a small square of sharp objects sticking out of the floor. He swings his legs to get the cage clear of the them and jumps. He follows signs written in red which apparently contain drivel from his book. He and his handlers are in the game.First is Nina, who Jigsaw charges as someone who continues to spread lies. She has a fishhook jammed down her throat and is tied up in a contraption. Screws in the contraption are all aimed at her neck and hooked to a sound measure. Jigsaw explains that the device measures the decibel level in the room, and if it exceeds a whisper the screws will advance and impale her in the neck. There is also a timer that will set off the screws unless she is unlocked from the contraption but the key is in Nina's stomach, Bobby must pull out the fishhook to retrieve it. She can't resist screaming in pain as Bobby tries to pull out the hook and splatters them both in blood. By the time he gets the hook out she's screaming loudly in pain, the screws impale her and she dies. Shaken, Bobby again accuses her of never being able to stay quiet.Next is Suzanna, who Jigsaw charges as someone who not only speaks lies but knowingly looks away from the truth. She is in a trap which will impale her in the eyes and mouth unless Bobby stands in a different machine and pushes a huge amount of weight up. He tries hard, but the contraption actually stabs him while he is lifting the weight. He is unable to handle the pain or hold up the weight for the required 30 seconds and the lawyer is killed. Now injured, Bobby slowly makes his way to the next room, where he finds a copy of his own book with his signature. The book is missing its jacket cover and Bobby finally gets a hint of Jigsaw's identity.Not long after Bobby had published his book he held a book signing where fans told him of the inspirational change he had wrought on their lives. A man identifying himself as John asks him about that role and Bobby claims to be spreading a good message, but John implies that lying on public record is never justified. He takes the signed book but removes the jacket cover, claiming he does not need it and giving Bobby a meaningful look. The flashback ends and Bobby, chilled with the realization that he had met the Jigsaw killer himself, moves on to the next room.The third and final obstacle is Bobby's friend Cale. He is on the other side of the room and blindfolded. The room lacks a floor and only has a few planks to grant its occupants movement, if they fall off the planks it could kill them. Hanging in the middle of the room is a key, the two men must meet halfway across the room so the key can unlock Cale's device because if time runs out Cale would be hanged. Bobby must guide the blindfolded Cale across the planks while he himself must reach the key. He talks Cale to a pretty close spot, grabs the key, tells Cale to keep his hands close to his body, counts to three and throws the key. It lands in Cale's hands but bounces off and falls to the floor. There is a split second of horror before Cale is hauled upward and dies.The detectives are still busy investigating the junk yard when there is an explosion. Gibson orders everyone back until the bomb squad has combed the area for any more explosives. During that time, Hoffman sends an email to Gibson, video footage of himself demanding for Jill and vague clues pointing to the new game's location. A female cop traces the email to the junk yard while Gibson figures out where the game is being played and sends in a SWAT team.Back to the game, Joyce's chain has been gradually shortening, pulling her down to the ground. Bobby and Joyce finally see each other and interact before Billy returns. Billy says that changing Bobby would be akin to ""pulling teeth"", which is precisely what Bobby must do to reach his wife. Two of his own teeth which have been etched with the access code for a lock on the door, this time there is no hesitation, despite screaming and bleeding Bobby works on pulling his teeth out. At this time the SWAT team (Simon Northwood, Regan Moore, Danny Lima, Bryan Thomas, etc...) arrives to the building, following Bobby's trail and coming across the dead bodies. They hear Bobby screaming and tries to save the one survivor but fall into a trap, where they are subsequently gassed to death.Bobby succeeds in pulling his teeth and puts in the code. He is finally in the same room as his wife but she is surrounded by electric wires. To save his wife, the prize and trophy of his lies, Bobby must do what he falsely claimed he did in the book - impale his pectoral muscles with hooks, hoist himself high in the air and connect two three pronged electrical cables. His wife asks what this is about and he admits that he was not a Jigsaw survivor. With only four minutes left, he impales himself and starts hoisting. Bobby is able to haul himself up high enough, and he gets one plug in his hand, but as he is reaching for the second plug, the hooks rip through his skin and muscle. He falls onto the floor and time runs out. A metal chamber shaped like a pig closes around Joyce and she quickly burns to death in front of Bobby.Jill is in protective custody. At the junk yard, Gibson finds Hoffman's control room and discovers a body. The body is one of the victims of the junk yard trap and he realizes that Hoffman had been present during that investigation. He also recognizes the computer screens as monitors tapped into the police security system; Hoffman has been watching them the whole time. As Gibson realizes this, a machine gun pops up from behind a desk and does a 360 while firing bullets, killing Gibson and the cops he had explained his realizations to. Back at the police station, when a morgue tech (Carlos Díaz) opens a body bag, Hoffman springs up and stabs him in the neck. Hoffman breezes through security, killing all the cops in his way, and gets to Jill's cell. She stabs Hoffman in the neck and, after realizing that the place is locked, hides. This time Hoffman finds her and in the struggle, he bangs her head on the table three times to knock her out. He ties her to a chair and puts the original Reverse Bear Trap on her head, setting the timer. After 45 seconds it rips her jaw open and kills her.Walking out unchallenged, Hoffman returns to the hideout, where he gathers together all of his money and some forged ID papers before setting the place on fire; destroying all of the remaining Jigsaw equipment. As he walks out to his car, three figures in pig masks incapacitate him, and the ringleader turns out to be the mysterious man with a cane, the same man in those Jigsaw survivor meetings, finally revealed to be Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes).He takes Hoffman to the bathroom from the first movie and chains him there. It is revealed that after amputating his foot and cauterizing the stump on the hot pipe so that he wouldn't bleed to death, Jigsaw nursed him back to health and rewarded him for winning his game by making him another apprentice. Dr. Gordon was, in fact, Jigsaw's most trusted apprentice, assisting with the medical aspects of the traps. Dr. Gordon was also entrusted with Jigsaw's last wish-- to watch over and protect Jill, and if she is murdered, to see that her killer faces justice. Dr. Gordon takes the hacksaw away at the last moment before closing the door, preventing Hoffman from escaping the same way he did, leaving him to die. As he seals Hoffman inside what will become his tomb, Dr. Gordon tells him ""Game Over."""

Since it's his only hope to pay for his daughter's upcoming wedding, he recruits his cop partner Paul to track down the robber, a memorabilia-obsessed gangster. After a clumsy operation trying to capture a drug dealer, the N.Y.P.D Detectives Jimmy Monroe and Paul Hodges are suspended for one month by their Captain Romans. Jimmy decides to sell his rare baseball card to pay for his daughter's expensive wedding while his jealous partner believes that his wife is cheating on him with their next-door neighbor. When Jimmy sells his card to a memorabilia store, the place is burgled by two small-time thieves and the detective loses his card. They track down the thieves.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Men with guns face humiliation: Jimmy's daughter wants a fancy wedding which he can't afford on his NYPD salary, so her step-father smiles and offers to pay Jimmy's share. Paul, Jimmy's partner, thinks his wife is two-timing him with a neighbor, so he hides a video camera in their bedroom. Jimmy can get money for the wedding by selling a rare baseball card, which he loses when the dealer he's selling it to is robbed. The robbery is connected to the thugs running drugs, as the partners discover when they search for the card. Will Paul be a cuckold and Jimmy upstaged at his daughter's wedding?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> The movie opens with Jimmy (Bruce Willis) and Paul (Tracy Morgan) in the interrogation room, working on a suspected drug dealer. Paul convinces Jimmy to let him try the interrogation this time and the crazy scene with all the movie quotes from the trailer ensues. They get the guy to rat out his supplier, so the next scene is at the guy's cell phone store, where Paul works as a sales person on the street with a cell phone costume on. He's casing the place, waiting for the supplier to show up so he can bust him, but when he does, the informant accidentally tips off the supplier who shoots him and splits out the back door. Paul chases him in the cell phone costume and eventually beats up a kid and steals his bike to chase the supplier. This is taped and put on YouTube, and when they don't catch the guy both cops are suspended without pay.Next, we see Jimmy and his ex-wife, daughter, and the ex-wife's new husband out at dinner. The daughter, Ava (Michelle Trachtenburg) wants an elaborate wedding (we see a bill for $48,000). Jimmy can't afford to pay for that, least of all now that he's suspended without pay. The new husband Roy (Jason Lee) offers to pay for it, but it's more to humiliate Jimmy than to help Ava. Jimmy can't let that happen, so he decides to sell his one of a kind baseball card, worth up to $80,000. When he arrives at the card shop to sell it, the shop is robbed by Dave (Seann William Scott) and an accomplice, who take money and memorabilia, including Jimmy's card. Jimmy sees Dave's distinctive tattoo and he and Paul figure out which shop he got it at, pressuring the tattoo artist and get a tip on the house he's going to rob next. They stake out the house before Dave gets there and once he arrives, they capture him and find out who's buying all the stuff from Dave.The buyer is drug overlord Po' Boy, who's brother was the supplier in the cell phone store. Jimmy and Paul go to see Po' Boy, and he agrees to give them the card back if they find his new car (which was stolen en route to him). The car was sold to a Russian lawyer, and they track him down. Once they get the car (and get Po' Boy's brother killed in the resulting chase), they decide to figure out why it's so important to Po'Boy, and they find Gabriella (Ana de la Reguera) in the trunk. She doesn't speak any English, so they take her to a diner to a guy they know who speaks Spanish, and he tells them she is the mistress of a Mexican drug lord. They know she's in trouble so they take her to a hotel to keep her safe, and just then Jimmy gets a call from some other cops who tell him Paul is a dirty cop (because his gun was used in a couple of gang killings after Dave stole it during the card shop robbery and sold it to Po' Boy). He rebukes them and goes back to the hotel, where he finds Paul asleep and Gabriella escaped through the window (saying she doesn't want to cause them any trouble by hanging around with them). She has left her crucifix on the table, which turns out to be bank account information for lots of accounts linked to drugs, which Po' Boy was attempting to steal.So now, knowing that the entire Po' Boy operation will be at the funeral for Po' Boy's brother for about an hour, they bail Dave out of jail so he can help them steal the card back. He promptly slips off the roof and is knocked out (setting up an in-credits gag where he wakes up in the morgue). Jimmy gets himself to the second floor and is still there when the organization returns to the house after capturing Gabriella off-screen. The other two cops who accused Paul show up (they had been working the case as well), and one is shot, prompting the other to call for backup to the house. This is when Paul is roused from his depression, figuring out that his wife, Debbie (Rashida Jones) isn't cheating on him, after all (a side-story running throughout). Paul and Jimmy proceed to clear the house of gangsters, leaving them with Po' Boy -- who has Gabriella hostage. They both shoot and both hit him, killing him instantly.After securing Gabriella with the paramedics, Jimmy returns to the house to find his baseball card, only to discover that it was in Po' Boy's front pocket, and Paul had destroyed it with his shot.The movie closes at the wedding, which Roy paid for. Jimmy's ex-wife Pam (Francie Swift) asks Jimmy to give away the bride with Roy (since Roy paid for the wedding, and all). He agrees, mostly because she threatens him. At the fateful moment, however, we see Paul (who is sitting behind Roy) put his gun in Roy's back, threatening to shoot if he stands to give away the bride -- allowing Jimmy the privilege all alone."

Edge of Darkness,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226273/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As homicide detective Thomas Craven investigates the murder of his activist daughter, he uncovers a corporate cover-up and government conspiracy that attracts an agent tasked with cleaning up the evidence. Thomas Craven is a detective who has spent years working the streets of Boston. When his own daughter is killed outside his own home, Craven soon realizes that her death is only one piece of an intriguing puzzle filled with corruption and conspiracy, and it falls to him to discover who is behind the crime.—alfiehitchie Thomas Craven, a single father, has been a Boston homicide detective for many years. His 24-year-old daughter Emma, his only child, is killed on the front steps of his home. At first it appears that Craven was the intended target. He soon uncovers evidence that leads him to think differently, and decides to pursue the information at all costs. He learns his daughter led a secret life that led to her murder. He quickly finds himself confronted with a shadowy world of corporate collusion with government-sanctioned murder. In the process he collides with a secret government operative, Darius Jedburgh, whose job is to clean up and hide any remaining evidence. Craven's singleness of purpose in finding answers about Emma's death becomes a transforming experience that changes his life.—briant-6 Widowed Boston Police Detective Thomas Craven thought he knew his only offspring, twenty-four year old Emma Craven, the two who had a seemingly loving, communicative father-daughter relationship. He begins to possibly doubt that belief when in Boston on vacation from her current base of nearby Northampton, Emma, displaying signs of a serious medical condition, tells her father that she should have told him ""this"" a long time ago implying it having to do with the reason for her vomiting, but she is never able to as she is soon after gunned down in cold blood outside the family home as they are on the way to the hospital emergency by an unknown perpetrator who is able to escape. With Tom's colleagues believing he was the intended target, Tom is officially on the case solely to provide his insight as to who might want to kill him. But without telling his colleagues, he instead follows leads pertaining specifically to Emma. He begins to believe that her death relates to something having to do with her work as an intern at Northmoor, an R&D company, her job which she never spoke of as she signed a confidentiality agreement with the company. One piece of the puzzle is the mysterious Englishman who shows up in Tom's backyard one evening, seemingly with a certain agenda before getting there, he deciding not to follow through with that agenda by the time he leaves. As Tom gets closer to figuring out the entire conspiracy, often working outside of the law, he knows that his life is in danger, but he hopes he can avenge Emma's death regardless of what happens to him.—Huggo When Emma--the twentysomething activist daughter of the veteran Boston Police homicide detective, Tom Craven--is murdered at point-blank on his front porch, it is assumed that he was the real mark. Devastated, the pained father embarks on a desperate personal investigation to get to the bottom of this intricate case, only to unearth a sinister web of corruption and a deadly top-level conspiracy at work. Now, Tom will have to take matters into his own hands; however, can a single man stand up against an invisible and all-powerful enemy?—Nick Riganas By moonlight, three bodies float to the surface of the western Massachusetts stretch of the Connecticut river. At South Station, Boston, Thomas Craven (Mel Gibson) picks up his daughter, Emma (Bojana Novakovic), who has returned home to visit. She throws up, while getting into Thomas' car. At home, as he prepares a meal, Emma starts a nosebleed and vomits violently and as they hurriedly leave to find a hospital, a masked gunman yells, Craven, and fires two shotgun blasts at Emma simultaneously. Blasted through the door, she dies in Thomas' arms.At first, everyone believes that Thomas, a police detective, was the gunman's target, but when Thomas finds Emma had a pistol in her night stand, he starts to suspect that Emma was an intended target. He checks the ownership of the pistol and finds that it belongs to her boyfriend David (Shawn Roberts). David is frightened of the company Northmoor where Emma worked and Thomas discovers that Emma became aware that Northmoor was manufacturing nuclear weapons, intended to be traced to foreign nations if they are used as dirty bombs. Following the failed break-in of the activists, Emma was poisoned with thallium through a carton of organic milk. Burning her effects in his lawn, Thomas encounters Jedburgh (Ray Winstone), a ""consultant"" tasked to prevent Craven from discovering Emma's information, or kill him. Liking each other, instead, Jedburgh leaves Thomas to investigate. Throughout the film, Thomas repeatedly imagines he hears and sees his daughter, even having short conversations and interactions with her.Thomas also has several encounters with Northmoor mercenaries, and he eventually discovers through Emma's activist contact that Jack Bennett (Danny Huston), head of Northmoor, ordered the murder of his daughter, as well as the activists Emma was working with to steal evidence of the illegal nuclear weapons (the bodies in the opening). Northmoor personnel kill a hitman marked as a fall guy after he is set up for killing Emma's boyfriend, and attempt to murder another activist who gave Emma's information to Thomas. After confronting a lawyer and Senator that Emma contacted, revealing that they know almost everything that happened, Bennett has Northmoor operatives allow Thomas to be poisoned with thallium, as his daughter had been.Thomas, now very sick, arrives at Bennett's house and kills the mercenaries, one of whom Thomas realizes is the man who shot his daughter. Bennett shoots Thomas, but Thomas tackles Bennett and pulls out the radioactive milk. He forces it down Bennett's throat and collapses. Bennett runs to his cabinet to get pills to counteract the radioactivity but Tom drags himself over and shoots Bennett through the throat, killing him.Thomas is hospitalized for the gunshot wounds and radioactive poisoning. Jedburgh, who is revealed to be suffering from a terminal illness, meets with Moore, the Senator (for whom he had been working) and the political advisor who assigned Jedburgh to eliminate Craven. He listens to their suggestions as to how to play the Northmoor incident in a positive light. He tells them that he is done and then suggests an assassination attempt on the Senator should be the feature story, to drive Bennetts death out of the tabloids. They are happy to go along with the story until Jedburgh tells the senator that he is on the wrong side of the equation. Jedburgh then pulls out his gun and shoots all three men dead before a young Massachusetts State Trooper comes in, gun drawn. Jedburgh gets the drop on the trooper and asks if the young man has a family and kids. The young man says yes and Jedburgh lowers his gun, and is instantly shot and killed by the trooper.As Thomas lies dying in the hospital, we see Emma walk into his room, then lean down at his bedside and whisper in his ear. Across town, a young reporter opens a letter from Thomas with DVDs revealing the conspiracy, with Thomas's good luck wishes, ensuring the company's end. As he dies, Emma comforts him. Then the father and daughter leave the hospital together, walking down the corridor into a bright, white light."

Brave, and selfish, General Edward is off to save the day - but Horatio knows he cannot reach the Princess in time and begs Gulliver to help. Horatio breaks his large friend free from his chains, and together they are off - first Gulliver drops the enemy spies into the village pond, before he does the only thing he can think to put out the flames in the palace and save the King -- to take quite a big leak.

The Last Exorcism,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320244/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A troubled evangelical minister agrees to let his last exorcism be filmed by a documentary crew. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the evangelical Reverend Cotton Marcus was raised by his father to be a preacher. He agrees that the filmmaker Iris Reisen and the cameraman Daniel Moskowitz make a documentary about his life. Cotton tells that when his wife Shanna Marcus had troubles in the delivery of their son Justin, he prioritized the doctor help to God and since then he questions his faith. Further, he tells that exorcisms are frauds but the results are good for the believers because they believe it is true. When Cotton is summoned by the farmer Louis Sweetzer to perform an exorcism in his daughter Nell, Cotton sees the chance to prove to the documentary crew what he has just told. They head to Ivanwood and they have a hostile reception from Louis's son Caleb. Cotton performs the exorcism in Nell, exposing his tricks to the camera, but sooner they learn that the dysfunctional Sweetzer family has serious problems.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Still questioning his faith in God, the once-pious minister, Reverend Cotton Marcus, no longer believes in what he's preaching. To prove that the purification rituals known as ""exorcisms"" are nothing more than elaborate hoaxes, Marcus decides to invite a documentary film crew to chronicle the last exorcism of his career. Before long, the urgent plea for help of the desperate farmer, Louis Sweetzer, will provide the perfect opportunity to clear things up, as he claims that malevolent spirits have taken possession of his young daughter, Nell. Of course, the staged routine is successful; however, that very same night, undeniable supernatural happenings start challenging the priest's scepticism. Could it be that a black demon has, indeed, possessed innocent Nell?—Nick Riganas Groomed by his father John Marcus starting when he was just a child to follow in his footsteps, Cotton Marcus, a natural performer, is a Baton Rouge based preacher, much of his work, like his father, carrying out exorcisms. Because of the accidental death of a supposedly possessed ten year old at the hands of another exorcist, and his now adolescent son Justin Marcus' brush with death at birth, Cotton admits to himself that he has never really believed in demons and thus possessions - all the exorcisms he asked to perform by like people with like stories, only the names being changed - and may not really believe in God, but had carried out such work, a scam, for his family and in providing a service in demand. As such, he decides to allow a documentary film crew to follow him at his next exorcism to show the process for the scam it is, he just choosing the next in the long list of requests he receives, this one from rural Ivanwood, LA. The supposedly possessed this time is sixteen year old home schooled Nell Sweetzer, the request coming from her devout farmer father, two-year widowed Louis Sweetzer, and apparently, as Cotton will discover, against the wishes of Nell's older brother, Caleb Sweetzer. Louis' devotion to his faith is despite he and his local preacher, Pastor Joseph Manley, having had a falling out over Nell, the Sweetzers who have not attended church now in two years. Cotton will discover that Nell is different than any of the other ""possessed"" before her that he's seen, and that he, and by association anyone else dealing with this case, including the documentary crew, may be over their heads and in possible danger, that is unless Cotton truly has the faith and the power he purports to his followers.—Huggo The Reverend Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian) lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with his wife (Shanna Forrestall) and son (Justin Shafer). Marcus is accustomed to performing exorcisms on ""possessed"" individuals, but his faith has waned after reading of an autistic child being killed during an exorcism, reminding him of his own disabled son. He comes to realize that he attributes the healing of his son to science, and not to Jesus Christ. He agrees to take part in a documentary designed to expose exorcism as a fraud, working with a film crew consisting of producer/director Iris Reisen (Iris Bahr) and cameraman Daniel Moskowitz (Adam Grimes). At random, he chooses a plea letter from an individual seeking an exorcism leading him to the farmhouse of Louis Sweetzer (Louis Herthum), a man who claims to have a possessed daughter named Nell (Ashley Bell). Prior to the exorcism, Marcus plants hidden speakers and electronic props so he can bamboozle the family into believing he is driving out a demon. After the ritual, Marcus and his film crew leave believing they have cured her of a mental state that was misdiagnosed as a possession by a powerful demon Abalam.That night, Nell mysteriously appears in Marcus' hotel room. The team tries to contact Louis to get permission to film her, to no avail. Wishing to prove his point, Marcus admits Nell to the hospital for testing, hoping to receive a medical or psychological diagnosis proving demonic possession is not the cause of her illness. The doctor concludes that Nell is in perfect physical condition. In the morning, her father takes her home and chains her in her room for slicing her brother Caleb (Caleb Landry Jones) in the face. While Louis takes Caleb to the hospital, Marcus and the camera crew further investigate Nell and the home. They find Nell and release her. That night there is a disturbance in the house, and Marcus and the crew hear the cries of a baby. They find Nell standing in a hallway. As they try to confront her, she heads into a bathroom, where she is found submerging a baby doll in water. After she comes out of her trance, the crew finds a drawing of a dead and bloodied cat.That night, while Marcus and the crew are asleep, Nell steals their camera and goes into her room, placing the camera on a dresser as she pulls and distorts her face. Nell goes into her father's barn where she corners a cat, beating it to death with the camera. She returns to the house and raises the camera over Marcus's head, ostensibly to beat him to death with it. The rest of the crew stops her, unaware of what transpired. They discover two more paintings of Nell's. The first depicts someone who appears to be Cotton standing before a large flame, holding up a crucifix. The second shows what appears to be the dead bodies of all three visitors to the Sweetzer farm: Cotton being consumed by the flame he was shown battling in the other picture, Iris hacked to pieces with an axe, and Dan decapitated.Louis comes home and listens to an answering machine message from the hospital stating that Nell is pregnant. Marcus thinks Louis might have committed the act of incest, which he denies, insisting that Nell is a virgin and has been defiled by the demon possessing her. Tempers flare as Marcus insists that Nell needs psychotherapy instead of another exorcism. Louis orders the crew to vacate his property. While contemplating whether they should take Nell, noises are heard upstairs. They discover Nell has climbed atop her dresser. As they try calming her she slashes Marcus's hand with a knife and runs outside. The crew decides to leave; as they enter their van they see Nell sitting on her porch. While approaching her, Nell tackles Marcus, attempting to harm him. The struggle leads inside as Louis chases them with a shotgun. Attempting to keep Louis from killing Nell, Marcus agrees to attempt another exorcism.They relocate to the barn where Nell killed the cat. The demon takes Nell again, making her bend backwards and break two of her fingers. She tells the crew that Nell is ""in the fire"", and that Louis will soon join her. ""Nell"" asks Marcus to let her give him a 'blowing' job. Marcus informs that this is not the correct term for such thing and therefore believes Nell is not possessed. Upon confronting Nell with this, she breaks down and admits to having sex with a boy named Logan and committing her violent acts out of shame of her pregnancy.On their way home, Marcus and the film crew detour to the coffee shop where Logan works. Logan tells the crew that the only contact he had with Nell was a brief conversation six months ago; he insinuates that he is gay and, therefore, would never have had sex with her. Marcus and the film crew wonder why Nell would lie, and Marcus immediately realises one of the things the devil is known as is ""The prince of lies"". The film crew follows as he returns to the Sweetzer's farmhouse. They enter the house to find numerous pentagrams and demonic symbols scrawled on the walls, but Nell and her family are missing. Marcus and the film crew wander into the woods where they see a large fire and a congregation of hooded occultists led by Pastor Manley (Tony Bentley), the Sweetzer's estranged Protestant minister. Nell's father is bound and gagged on a pole while hooded figures pray around an altar, which Nell is tied on top of. Marcus and the film crew watch as Nell gives birth to something that is not of the human race. Manley throws it into the fire, which causes the fire to grow rapidly while demonic voices grow louder. At that moment Marcus' faith is resolved as he grabs his cross and rushes towards the fire in a frenzied attempt to combat the evil. Iris and Daniel are discovered and run away. Iris is tackled by a member of the occult congregation who murders her with an axe. When Daniel pauses to catch his breath, Caleb rises out of nowhere and mortally wounds him. The camera falls to the ground and the scene fades to black."

Their customers, the Anderson family, are stranded until Jeep can fix their BMW and lonely Kyle Williams who is lost.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film begins with a quote from the Bible, something about fearing God before a sunset sky fades in and we hear a voice over by Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) telling the audience about what her mother used to say about God, and how he was ever loving and forgiving, but eventually got tired of all of humanity's bullshit and became an angry, vengeful God. It is now nighttime, and we see a man fall from very high, landing in a back alley somewhere in Los Angeles.The fallen man is the Angel Michael (Paul Bettany). Soon after arrival, Michael takes out a large knife and cuts off his own wings, causing a blue halo to close around him, and removing a large metal collar from around his neck: he is presumably mortal now, and no longer taking orders from Heaven. Recovering a bit, Michael looks across the street at a Chinese toy import warehouse, and heads toward it.Inside, a security guard (Stephen Oyoung) is patrolling the premises when Michael crashes through the glass ceiling, knocking him out, and stealing his clothes. Inside the warehouse's bathroom, Michael grabs a med kit and stitches up the wounds from where his wings were removed. Upon finishing up, he finds what he was looking for in the warehouse, a shipping container crammed full of guns (apparently toys were not the only thing this company was shipping). He begins to grab several guns off the walls and walks out of the container with two large duffel bags. He then looks at a door in front of him.Two cops are on patrol in their squad car and discuss how bad things have gotten, and older of the two says that he sometimes wished that he could just torch the place and let it start over, and that this city is about to explode from all the crime and evil but before he can continue, there is a massive explosion in front of them and out comes Michael from the warehouse, carrying the two large duffel bags of firearms. The cops try to arrest him, but he gets one of them in an arm lock, while pointing a gun at the other. Suddenly, the lights flickering on and off, and the cop pointing the gun at Michael starts to shake violently. Once the cop stops shaking, he has noticeably different black eyes, and possessing a mouth full of pointy shark-like teeth. The possessed man shoots the other cop, asks what Michael is doing, as his intervention on Earth is violating his orders. Michael says that he is following his own orders now, shoots the possessed cop, grabs his bags of guns, and drives off in the squad car. As Michael leaves, darkness surrounds the city the apocalypse has begun.Cut to the Mojave Desert, the camera pans to a small desert diner/gas station where a bunch of locals work, including Charlie, an unwed single mother (well, pregnant) working as a waitress. Charlie speaks to one of her coworkers/friend, Jeep (Lucas Black), and it's evident that he has feelings for her, and wants to take care of her and the baby, even though she doesn't seem to return his affections. Inside the diner, Jeep's father Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid) is trying to fix an old 60s era TV by slapping at it with varying degrees of success while the chef, Percy Walker (Charles S. Dutton) teases him about getting a new one. A married couple, Howard and Sandra Anderson (John Tenney and Kate Walsh) and their daughter Audrey (Willa Holland) are stuck at the diner, waiting for their car to be fixed. Sandra complains to Howard about their daughters clothing (too scantily clad) and it's evident that Howard is the relaxed type, Sandra is a bit uptight, and Audrey is the rebellious teenager.At the diner Sandra is complaining from how long the repairs are taking, and gets Howard to talk to Bob. Bob tells him that it shouldn't be long, and goes to check on his son. In the garage, Bob finds Jeep cleaning up an old crib instead of fixing the car and reprimands him for it. Jeep says that he knows that Charlie doesn't love him, but believes that taking care of her and the baby is something that he just has to do. Bob tells Jeep that he once had a dream to do something too, and opening this gas station/diner in hopes of profiting when a mall was to be opened across the road. However, the plans were scrapped and Bob was left with a business out in the middle of nowhere, and his wife left him and Jeep to fend for themselves. It's clear that Bob loves his son, and doesn't want him to chase a dream only to realize too late that it's a dead end, but he eventually relents, and tells Jeep to just finish work on the car.Out in the desert, a man by the name of Kyle Williams (Tyrese Gibson) is driving along the interstate, but has become lost, and ends up at the diner. There, he meets Charlie, making small talk and getting a cigarette off of her. A few moments later, they go inside and Charlie gets back to work while Kyle looks for a phone since his cell phone has stopped working. Kyle gets on the phone with his ex-wife and they are apparently in a custody battle over his son, which is why Kyle is in such a hurry. However, before he can say more, the phone stops working. Jeep enters the diner as well to tell Bob that the car he was supposed to work on is too advanced, that there's something wrong with the computer system, and they don't have the equipment to fix it. Jeep suggests having the car towed to the next town over, but Kyle returns from the phone and says that he was cut off mid-sentence and that the phones are now dead. Around this time, the TV stops working too. After a bit of hitting, the TV jumps to the emergency broadcast signal (the THIS IS NOT A TEST, along with a loud beeping tone). Percy tries the radio, but gets the same signal. Bob tries his best to calm everyone down, and says that it's probably just an earthquake nearby that's causing all the problems.A few moments later, a car stops at the front, and out comes a little old lady (Kaye Wade) on a walker. The old woman enters the diner and is greeted by Charlie, and orders a nearly raw steak. Charlie returns with the steak and the old lady asks her about her baby. After a few more questions, the woman says that the baby will burn, and that they will all burn. When Sandra confronts the woman, she just yells at her and how all she does is complain. Howard, taking offence to this, confronts the old woman as well, but before he is able to say much, the woman lunges at him and takes a bite right out of the side of his neck, leaving him to bleed out on the floor. The old woman transforms (black eyes, sharp teeth) and Percy throws a frying pan right at her head, knocking her out. However, the woman gets back up and crawls right up the ceiling. Bob grabs his rifle and tries to shoot her, but she's too fast, and knocks him out. Jeep grabs the fallen shotgun and tries to shoot her, but just can't bring himself to do it. The possessed woman is about to lunge at Jeep, but is brought down by several gun shots not from Jeep, but from Kyle, who was carrying a handgun.After a bit of frantic talk about demons and monsters, and their inability to call for help, they decide to put Howard in the one remaining car and drive him to the next town for help. Howard, Sandra, Audrey, Percy and Kyle get into the car and head out, while Bob and Jeep are left to decide on what to do with the corpse.As they drive, Audrey notices a strange cloud in the distance, but Kyle just brushes it off as a storm or something. However, the cloud seems to be moving, and becomes evident that it's not a cloud, but a massive swarm of flies. The flies surge towards the car and start to get in through the air conditioning vents and begin to fill up the car. Back at the diner, Bob and Jeep hear a car approach and go outside to see the others returning and running back into the dinner to avoid the flies.Having no other choice, the group decides to stay put until they can call for help. Bob and Jeep wrap up the possessed woman's corpse and take her outside. Bob spots a police cruiser out in the distance and greets it gladly, thinking that help as finally arrived, except that it isn't a cop, but Michael. Realizing that it's not a cop, Bob points his gun at Michael and demands to see his teeth. Michael complies, and grabs the gun from Bob and points it at him. Before things can escalate any further, Michael senses something, and gives the gun back to Bob, then arms everyone else with the guns that he had brought from LA. He tells them that they are coming.Inside the diner, he says that they will be here soon, and that they must defend themselves. Michael gives Charlie a gun too, and tells her not to do anything heroic.As the sun sets, the men head up to the roof to watch for any incoming help/attackers. Soon, they hear a sound from the distance, and it's an ice cream truck. The ice cream man (Doug Jones) gets out of the truck and is obviously possessed, but the people in the diner aren't sure. Suddenly, the ice cream man's arms and legs lengthen grotesquely and he lets off an inhuman scream before charging at the diner. Michael takes aim and guns it down, and tells the others that more are coming.And a few moments later, a large number of cars come over the horizon, all filled with possessed people. As the cars approach, Michael orders the others to fire, and they comply, causing many cars to swerve crash and explode. Even with all the men firing down at the incoming army of possessed, many more are coming from the other direction of road. Michael whips out a rocket launcher and take out a large number of them, along with a truck carrying large pipes, blocking the roads a bit. Michael yells to the others to keep the possessed from reaching the diner, but there are just too many of them. Downstairs, Audrey, Sandra, Charlie and Howard and hiding among the diner's tables, but one of the possessed crashes through the window and grabs Howard, attempting to drag him out. Charlie tries to help Sandra and Audrey, but she is almost taken herself by one of the possessed until Michael slices off the man's hand and fights them off with a lot of bullets.The first wave is over, but Howard was taken.Everyone is scared and confused until Michael reveals that he is there to protect Charlie and her unborn child, and that the possessed that attacked them were not demons, but angels sent by God. Michael tells them that the key to humanity's survival is Charlie's baby, and they must protect her until the child is born. Charlie says that the child is not supposed to be born yet, but realizes that it will happen soon anyway (the current date in the film is December 24).The survivors go off to deal with the situation in their own way: Bob makes some food and cracks into a beer, offering one to a grieving Sandra. Audrey is also grieving for her father, quietly sobbing in the corner. Percy and Kyle are on the rooftop discussing why Kyle was carrying a gun and Kyle replies that he's had a rough childhood, and has carried a gun since then, implying that he's done some criminal activities, but never actually fired it before that morning. Percy replies by telling him a story about his father, and how before each night, he should contemplate whether he is proud of the things he's done, and if he isn't, then he should get right on it.Down in the basement, Jeep and Michael are working to fortify the Diner, and Jeep asks Michael why he is helping them, especially if it means violating heaven's orders. Michael tells Jeep that when God first made man, he was the first to bow down before them, because, like God, he loved humanity. And even though God has given up on them, Michael has not. Michael has a quick flashback to his time in Heaven he speaks with Gabriel (Kevin Durand) about God's decision to eradicate humanity and start over. Michael openly challenges the decision, and claims that it is what God wants, but not what he needs. Gabriel, who has chosen to follow God's directives without question confronts Michael, telling him that he cannot go against the will of God and his army of Angels. Gabriel says that the order has been given, and up in the sky, a massive swarm of Angels fly in formation towards Earth. The flash back ends and Michael tells Jeep that he still has hope in humanity, even through all the atrocities that humanity has inflicted upon itself, because of people like Jeep, who do not give up in spite of the challenges ahead, and love unconditionally. Michael leaves Jeep to think about what he said.As morning approaches, Sandra wakes up and hears her husband's voice. She follows the voice to the window at the rear office and sees that Howard is still alive, tied upside down to a cross. Sandra pushes the barricade aside to get to her husband, even as Audrey and Percy try to stop her. She makes it outside and it appears that Howard has large pulsing boils all over his body and is about to explode. Percy grabs Sandra just in time and pushes her back into the diner, but is covered in spray from the exploding Howard. The others arrive at the office to watch as Percy falls to the grown dead, having had his entire back side melted off by some kind of acid.The others tie Sandra to a chair until she can calm down while Audrey gives her a pill to help her calm down. Sandra blames Audrey for the mess they are in, since they were moving to another town for Audrey. Audrey is devastated, but copes with it.The morning passes by quickly with nothing much really happening until sundown. Suddenly, all the lights and power come back to the diner, and everyone wonders if things are better, but Michael assures them that it's not over. They hear over the radio (it's working now) that some survivors have banded together to fight the infected (possessed) and have made a small settlement nearby. The group wants to leave, but Michael says that it's not safe.Up on the roof, Kyle and Audrey are on watch, and Kyle teaches Audrey how to fire a gun. Audrey already knows how though, as she dated a marine mostly to anger her parents. She's the rebellious type, and has been acting out for most of her childhood, mostly to get attention from her parents. Kyle can relate, as it was pretty much what he did as a child too. They share a few more moments reminiscing about their childhoods before Kyle notices a van approach the gas station. Thinking that is filled with more possessed people, Kyle aims his gun at it, but soon realizes that it's a survivor of the apocalypse, and his son. The man is just trying to get some gas, but is soon surrounded by the possessed.The man (Denney Pierce) doesn't see them coming until Kyle fires into the air to alert him, but it's too late, the man is killed by a car driven by the possessed and the child (Cameron Harlow) is taken. Kyle, thinking of his own son jumps down and attempts to save him. However, the child was possessed as well, and bites into Kyle's neck, killing him. Audrey sees this and charges towards Kyle to save him, killing several of the possessed along the way, but running out of ammo as she reaches Kyle and manages to protect herself by locking herself inside a minivan. Inside the diner, Bob wants to go save Kyle and Audrey, but is threatened with death by Michael, who cannot risk them opening the door and letting in the possessed. Charlie confronts Michael and says that if he doesn't do something, she will. Having no choice, Michael arms up, and orders them to open the door just long enough to let him inside. Michael gets outside and takes down many of the possessed, then sprays gasoline on the rest and sets them on fire and saving Audrey. However, the possessed have now turned their attention on the diner and try to get in. After a bit of a gun fight, all the possessed are killed or frightened off, except for one, the child that Kyle tried to save. The possessed child attacks Charlie and almost succeeds, but she fights him off with a dinner tray until Michael can dispose of him. However, the fight with the child triggered caused Charlie's water to break, and her child will be born soon.Audrey is given the task of helping with the childbirth while everyone else watches out for more attackers. The outside is now completely surrounded by the possessed, but they aren't attacking. As the child is born, it starts crying, which appears to cause great pain to the possessed. A moment later, a massive bellowing horn is heard, and Michael says that they have to leave. The others protest, but Michael tells them that since the child has been born, none of the possessed can even approach him, but because of this, something more powerful is coming to claim the child, Gabriel (hence the horn).The survivors are packing up to leave and Sandra and Audrey reconciles their differences, however, Sandra believes that all the possessed want is the child, and decides to give them what they want so that she and Audrey can leave. Sandra grabs the child and heads for the door, while Michael aiming his gun at her head, demanding for her to stop. Just then, another horn blast his heard and the door behind Sandra glows white. The door slams open and Gabriel is standing right behind her. Having no choice, Michael shoots Sandra, causing her to drop the baby, but Jeep is close enough to catch him. Jeep and the baby get out of the way just in time as Gabriel swings at them with a huge iron mace. Bob attempts to shoot at Gabriel, but Gabriel spins around and blocks the shots with his wings (which appear to have the consistency of metal). As Bob runs out of ammo, Gabriel extends a wing and slices into his stomach, and throwing Bob into the kitchen.Michael tells everyone to leave out back, but he stays to hold back Gabriel, instructing Jeep to learn to read the instructions, and find the prophets to Jeep's confusion, but there's no time to talk.Michael confronts Gabriel and asks him not to continue, to let the child live. Gabriel has already made up his mind, and will never disobey. It is evident that neither wants to fight the other, but they have no choice but to fight until one dies. Michael shoots at Gabriel while Gabriel takes swings at Michael with his mace and wings . Michael is injured by Gabriel's wing but manages to put him in a headlock. However, Gabriel apologizes to Michael, and then stabs himself through the chest with a spike from his mace, which impales Michael as well. Gabriel is technically still immortal, while Michael has become mortal from cutting his wings, and so Michael dies. Gabriel tells him that since he loves humanity so much, he will die like them. As Michael dies, he glows blue and burns up/disappears at the same time, the same tattoo-like marking that were on Michael's body, appears on Jeep (the instructions mentioned earlier). Gabriel turns and prepares to pursue the others, but walks past Bob, who is still alive, and has disconnected the gas pipes and is now attempting to light them. Before Gabriel can fly away, Bob ignites the gas, causing a massive explosion.Out on the road, Jeep, Charlie, the child, and Audrey are on their way towards one of the colony of survivors mentioned on the radio earlier. As they get closer to the colony, things seem to be going right at last, but a slightly singed Gabriel crashes onto the roof of the car, still trying to get to the child. After much struggling, Audrey is able to hold back Gabriel, and tells Jeep to hit the break, which he does, throwing both Audrey and Gabriel out of the car, and crashing the car as well. A moment later, Jeep is awoken by Charlie, who survived the crash, along with the baby. However, Audrey was killed, and Gabriel is missing.The remaining three head towards the mountain range where the survivors are supposed to be, but as they climb up the mountain, Gabriel shows up again. Jeep is able to grab onto Gabriel, pushing them both off a cliff, with Gabriel breaking Jeep's fall. Gabriel doesn't want to kill Jeep, but sees that there's no choice, and pulls out his knife. Just then, a resurrected Michael comes down from heaven (back in Angel form) and fights off Gabriel. Michael tells Gabriel that he was brought back because he did the right thing, that he gave God what he needed, and not what he wanted. Since he no longer has purpose (God rescinded the order), Gabriel leaves. Michael returns to Heaven as well, bidding Jeep good luck. Jeep returns to Charlie and the baby, and they head towards to settlement below.Charlie repeats her voiceover from the beginning, and we see Charlie, Jeep, and the baby in their car, driving off into the distance, with the back of the car full of guns."

As she and her friends wrestle with a number of different dramas, everything comes to a head at their prom. Washington's Spork town sheriff, Frank Crane, welcomes back his returning daughter, Becca. Despite obvious signs, Becca takes an unusually long time to recognize the Halloween decorations up, all over. Even the odd appearances of various people, including her old friend, Jacob White, who's suddenly got canine traits (including a tail), and an odd urge to chase cats. She falls in love with sickly pale Edward Sullen, a member of the depressed, bloodthirsty adopted family of Dr. Carlton.—KGF Vissers Becca Crane (Jenn Proske) moves to Sporks to live with her clueless father, Sheriff Frank (Diedrich Bader), after her mother starts an affair with Tiger Woods. Meanwhile, killings have been happening to random people and the number one suspects are the Canadians. It is in fact a group of vampires, who are (apparently) commonly confused with the Black Eyed Peas. (This is shown in the scene in which the fisherman is killed, when one asks, ""You know who we are, don't you?"" to which the fisherman responds, ""Yes...you're the Black Eyed Peas!"" Jack responds with, ""Not again."") Becca is quickly befriended by many students at her new high school, (which is odd, considering the welcome she was given) including Jennifer (Anneliese Van Der Pol) but she is intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter), who perplexes her during their time in the biology class, despite thinking she smells of tuna.Later, Becca is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward inexplicably moves from several feet away and stops the vehicle by thrusting another student in its path without any harm to himself or Becca (the other student is very badly injured). He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother. Edward corrects her, saying he is a vampire but that he only consumes animal blood (and the Real Housewives of Atlanta), and shows her the shiny bling he wears under his clothes. He also states he is a killer, and shoots Alice (from Alice in Wonderland) The pair fall in love, and he introduces Becca to his vampire family on her birthday. While unwrapping a gift, Becca gets a paper cut, after which one of the newer vampires (Jeremiah) runs at her. Edward flings her back, and then does the same to Jeremiah. She then is bleeding from her arm, and the blood falls in a pyramid-shape of champagne glasses. After locking his dad and brother in tanning beds, he notices Becca has a nose bleed.Realizing the danger that he and his family pose to Becca, Edward rides a Segway PT out to the woods. He then proceeds to break up with Becca, who throws a temper tantrum after he leaves. After the fit, the three vampires appear that killed the fisherman. She begins to be eaten, but Edward shows up. After Jack retrieves his fangs from Becca's arm and leaps at Edward, Edward dispatches him by knocking his head off with a baseball bat. Jack's head flies through Sheriff Frank's car window, and he blames the Kardashians.Edward's departure leaves Becca heartbroken for months. She discovers that thrill-seeking activities and attempted suicides evoke Edward's preserved image. She is also comforted by her deepening friendship with Jacob White (Christopher N. Riggi), the cheerful childhood friend who eases her pain over losing Edward. When Becca is accosted in the woods by the last of the nomadic vampires (the third not appearing, as she was recast), Jacob transforms into a Chihuahua as his werewolf pack arrives to save her. Meanwhile, Edward has moved to Rio De Janeiro and is now dating Lady Gaga to get over losing Becca. When his sister arrives and tells him that, with her gift of prophecy, she has seen Becca kill herself, Edward becomes depressed and decides to provoke the ""Zolturi"", a powerful vampire coven, by exposing himself in the sunlight at 'St. Salvatore's day' school prom and forcing them to kill him for revealing that vampires exist. His sister has another vision of Becca's survival as he leaves, but she is unable to warn him.Edward's sister arrives at Becca's house in her Porsche 911, and tells her she has to save Edward by showing him she is still alive. Jacob appears and demands that Becca choose between him and Edward, but just before she announces her decision he is distracted by a cat and runs off to chase it. Upon arriving at the prom, Becca is caught between the warring factions of Edward fan-girls and Jacob fan-girls. She is unable to reach Edward before he exposes himself, figuratively and literally. However, twilight occurs (followed by a new moon and an eclipse), concealing Edward's vampire nature as Becca gets him to safety. But after a fight between him and the Zolturi leader, Daro (Ken Jeong), Edward is forced to make Becca into a vampire or else he will be killed horribly. He agrees to do so only on the condition that she marry him, which she accepts.The film concludes with Edward taking a blow to the head from the head Jacob fan-girl, who shouts ""Team Jacob, b***h!"" Edward survives the blow, and the girl is attacked by the newly-Vampirized Becca."

When a job in Sweden ends more harshly than expected for this American abroad, he vows to his contact Pavel that his next assignment will be his last. Jack reports to the Italian countryside, where he holes up in a small town and relishes being away from death for a spell. The assignment, as specified by a Belgian woman, Mathilde, is in the offing as a weapon is constructed. Surprising himself, Jack seeks out the friendship of local priest Father Benedetto and pursues romance with local woman Clara. But by stepping out of the shadows, Jack may be tempting fate.—Anonymous After he survives an ambush beside a remote Swedish lake, an American hit man goes to Rome and contacts his control, Pavel, who sends him to an Abruzzian town with the warning, ""No friends."" He takes one look and goes instead to nearby Castelvecchio where he poses as a photographer and waits for his control to take care of the Swedish problem. While waiting, his control gives him a job constructing a special weapon for a Belgian assassin, he converses with the town's priest, and he spends the occasional night with Clara, a local prostitute. After the priest calls him out on his profession and the Swedes get a line on his whereabouts, is it time to get out?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> In Dalarna, Sweden, the lonely hit man and craftsman Jack has a tragic encounter with two assassins hired to kill him and survives an ambush. Jack travels to Rome and calls his contact Pavel (Johan Leysen) that meets him in a cafeteria, gives a Fiat Tempra to him and asks Jack to travel to the countryside for a next assignment. Sooner a woman called Mathilde meets Jack and delivers the specification of a sophisticated weapon to be constructed by him. While living in the village and building the weapon, Jack befriends the local priest and has sex with the prostitute Clara. The distrustful Jack gets closer to Clara and sooner they date outside the brothel. When Jack tells Pavel that this work will be his last one and he will retired after delivering the weapon, Jack is betrayed and he does not know who can be trusted.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Jack (George Clooney), a gunsmith and contract killer, and his lover Ingrid (Irina Björklund) are relaxing in a remote cabin in Sweden. While they are walking, Jack becomes alarmed by a single pair of footprints in the snow. His instincts kick in just as sniper gunshots ring out. As they dive for cover, a panicked and horrified Ingrid watches Jack pull a gun from his pocket. Jack quickly silences her questions and shoots the approaching sniper. Ingrid is almost in shock from the events. She begins to understand something is seriously wrong beyond the fact that she and Jack have just been attacked. As Jack begins to probe the murdered assassin's clothing for identification she asks him what he is doing. Jack knows his true identity is in jeopardy and that he cannot allow Ingrid to call the police. He instructs her to go into the house and make the call and with cold detachment, shoots her in the back as she runs past.Jack then tracks down a second assassin lurking in the snow and kills him. He flees to Rome and contacts a ""business associate"", his handler named Pavel (Johan Leysen). Pavel insists that Jack cannot stay in Rome, sends him to Castelvecchio (a small town in the mountains of Abruzzo) and tells him ""Don't make any friends, Jack."" Jack becomes nervous, and, disposing of the cell phone which Pavel had given him, goes to nearby Castel Del Monte instead. Jack has been deeply shaken by the events in Sweden. As a contract killer for hire, his skills as an assassin have been a commodity he has coldly and stoically sold, but the murder of Ingrid, a friend in the wrong place at the wrong time, causes him great anguish.While in Abruzzo, Jack (now going by the name Edward and posing as a photographer) contacts Pavel, who sets him up with another job. He meets with a woman, Mathilde (Thekla Reuten), who wants him to build a custom-designed sniper rifle for an assassination. He also begins patronizing a prostitute, Clara (Violante Placido) and they begin a relationship separate from her business duties. His considerable skills as a craftsman are on display as he fashions a custom sound suppressor for the gun out of spare parts and drive shaft bearings obtained at a local automotive garage and an attache case for its concealment and transport. Jack meets with Mathilde to test the weapon, based on a Ruger Mini-14 (referred to in the film as an M14). Mathilde is impressed by the craftsmanship, but asks that Jack make a few more adjustments. Later, Jack realizes that he is being followed by an assassin from Sweden, whom he kills.Jack begins to be tormented by dreams of the events in Sweden and regret for having killed Ingrid to cover his true identity. His relationship with a local priest Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli) causes him to question his life choices and the emptiness of his life on the run. Both Mathilde and Clara notice Jack's association with butterflies, Mathilde by his expertise on endangered butterflies and Clara by his prominent tattoo. When Father Benedetto tells Jack he senses he lives in a special kind of hell...""a place without love"", Jack begins to allow himself to feel love for Clara and he begins to envision a life with her.Jack talks to Pavel one last time, asking how the Swedes have possibly found him. His paranoia grows to the point that even Clara comes under suspicion when Jack discovers a small pistol in her purse she keeps for protection. While on a picnic, he sees Clara reach into her bag and he retrieves a gun from inside the picnic basket. His eyes fill with despair that he might have to kill another woman he has been intimate with to cover his identity. Clara removes a tube of sunscreen from her bag and asks a greatly relieved ""Edward"" to put some on her back. In the car, Jack questions Clara about the gun and is satisfied with her explanation. She asks him to take her home with him. Jack refuses but his outward facade of the stone faced, cold blooded killer is crumbling.Jack agrees to deliver the weapon to Mathilde as his last job, but at the last moment he reopens the briefcase and modifies the rifle. At the drop-off, Jack becomes suspicious that Mathilde plans to kill him. Before anything can happen, a busload of school children arrives, and the two separate. While driving away, Mathilde is contacted by Pavel, who asks if she has killed Jack. She informs him she has not, but insists that she is following Jack and will kill him.In town, Clara meets Jack in the crowd at a local religious procession. Jack realizes his life as an assassin is over and that he has fallen deeply in love with Clara..He asks her to go away with him and she agrees. Mathilde attempts to assassinate Jack from a nearby rooftop, but the rifle backfires and explodes in her face due to Jack's adjustments. Seeing her fall from the roof, Jack shoves an envelope thick with cash from the gun deal into Clara's hands and tells Clara to go to a river where they previously picnicked and wait for him. He runs to Mathilde, who is dying on the pavement, and discovers she works for Pavel, the same as Jack does.As Jack goes to meet Clara, he notices that Pavel is following him. They exchange gunfire, and Pavel is killed. Jack doesn't realize he has been shot at first and he drives to meet Clara at the river. As his physical distress begins to alarm him, Jack feels his abdomen and blood soaked shirt realizing for the first time he has been injured. He pounds the steering wheel with a bloody fist in anger and despair. Jack arrives at the picnic spot and as he sees Clara, he collapses. Clara screams and runs to the car. A white, endangered butterfly flits skyward from Jack's car back-lit by ethereal light filtering through the tall trees of the forest. The credits roll."
Green Zone,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947810/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Discovering covert and faulty intelligence causes a U.S. Army officer to go rogue as he hunts for Weapons of Mass Destruction in an unstable region. Following the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller and his men are charged with finding the so-called weapons of mass destruction, whose existence justified American involvement, according to the Pentagon and their man in Baghdad, Poundstone. Veteran CIA operative Marty tells Miller that there are no weapons, it is a deception to allow the Americans to take over the country and install a puppet leader. Also suspicious of Poundstone is Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne, who lets slip to Miller that Poundstone told her he had secret talks in Jordan with an important Iraqi, code-named Magellan, who told him about the weapons, though it now seems likely Magellan's true information was to the contrary. So begins a hunt for the truth. Who's playing whom?—don @ minifie-1 Bombs are exploding loudly outside a house. Inside, Iraqi men are mobilizing to leave, but waiting for General Al Rawi. As he leaves, he orders his men to meet him at the safe houses. Baghdad is under attack.Chief Roy Miller (Matt Damon) and his Mobile Exploitation Team (MET) are about to raid a site based on solid intelligence which has confirmed it as a site for chemical and biological WMD. Their job is to discover evidence of WMDs in Iraq, something the whole world and US is waiting anxiously for, as it is one of the sole reasons for the invasion. In their Humvees, they reach near the site where another army team, even though with a fairly large platoon, is unable to secure the place from civilian looters, who are grabbing and carrying anything they can get their hands on out of the site. Miller is trying to get his team into the site to deactivate and secure the WMD but is not given any assistance by the other team. It is very chaotic. They are told by the leader of the other team that there is a sniper holed up in the building site. After some tactical discussion, Miller and his team move in. They sniff out the sniper and take him down. After donning their masks and equipment, they survey the site in darkness, only to realize it was empty. Roy comments this is the 3rd straight time they have come up cold.Back in the airport, we see reporters gathering for the arrival of the soon-to-be appointed Iraqi minister. Lawrie Dayne, a WSJ reporter, goes to her source, Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear, a Pentagon Intelligence) and asks him for more tips on Magellan. He says he is trying but he has given her all he/s got and the information is very sensitive. She is quite unhappy about this; he ignores her and goes to greet the minister as they leave for the Green Zone (a secured place that was once Saddam's republic palace. Even them it is in parts and ruins). Poundstone is pushing an agenda of democracy for Iraq but it is constantly being challenged by the rampant chaos in the country. They have a meeting and animosity exists between Poundstone and a CIA Intel, Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) who seems like a veteran in Iraqi affairs. Martin raises the issue to Poundstone that they cannot run Iraq on their own they need help from the old guard, and that they have yet to find WMDs. Poundstone disagrees and says its just a matter of time.Roy Miller returns to his camp and goes to look for his boss. He tells him that the intelligence does not seem to add up. His boss tells him nicely to shove it and says he cannot question the intelligence. Roy is not satisfied and at a group meeting, he brings it up, saying for the last few times all his team has gotten is a doughnut. He is shut up by being told that the intelligence source is reliable and all info has been verified, and that's that. Martin Brown is at this group meeting and as Miller leaves to check out another source, Martin approaches him and says he suspects the same and gives his number to Miller to contact him if anything crops up. Miller goes to the Al Mansour site (on the way they are mobbed by a huge crowd who are very angry because they have no water) and begins digging up holes to find the WMDs.Meanwhile, General Al Rawi and his old guard of senior ranking Iraqi army officers are meeting at one of the safe houses. They begin to discuss what to do with the American soldiers having invaded Iraq. General Al Rawi appears very calm and wise, and he advises that they wait and see. Unknowingly, an Iraqi civilian in that area going to his car has noticed the unusual group heading into the house. While Miller and his team are still digging holes, suddenly there is some commotion with one of Miller's officers. He goes to see what the problem is, and his soldier is sitting atop the Iraqi civilian with the limp, pushing his head into the sand. The man is struggling, obviously feeling very upset. Roy tells his men to ease off and the Iraqi civilian starts to rant at Miller. Miller waits for him to finish and calm down before asking him what he wants. The Iraqi says he has information to share but he did not expect to be treated like dirt for doing so. Miller asks what is it and the man says he saw this strange bunch of guys heading into the house, surrounded by bodyguards with AK-47s. Miller rounds his men up for an attack. One of Miller's men prefers to do things by the book and is quite reluctant to do anything outside of their orders. However, this time around, he gives in. Miller says they can't roll up in their Humvees and so they steal some beat-down cars and follow the Iraqi to the house. Just as they arrive they start to notice some of the participants are about to leave. They launch an attack and in the exchange, Miller spots General Al Rawi (who escapes by the back) and identifies him as the Jack of Clubs. They capture the meeting host, who has a little black book supposedly containing addresses of the safe-houses and plans. Roy interrogates the man, who says only Al Rawi has the info on WMD sites, the others do not know. Just as they are about to take the prisoners back, 3 army helicopters filled with special forces come in and bully the MET around. They take the prisoners away. Miller manages to sneak the book on Freddy to get it away from the Special Forces. Miller is puzzled how the Special Forces knew of their raid so quickly and why he was denied his only real lead on the WMD sites. Poundstone is informed of the capture, and he and Lawrie's arrangement sours, as he is unable to provide her with more updates.Miller gets the book back and calls Martin about it. Miller's team splits into 2 and agree to meet at the pool in the Republic palace, where they see people having fun, drinking beer and eating Dominoes pizza. Miller gives Martin the black book and says he needs to get to the meeting host because he knows where to find Al Rawi. Martin says he'll do what he can. Lawrie spots Miller and makes her move on him for info; he says he'll keep it in mind. In his room, he looks up her articles on the net and finds that her articles cites very similar coincidental sources of the WMD sites as his Intel brief does.The meeting host is being tortured for information. He keeps mentioning the book. Poundstone suspects Martin has it. Martin calls Miller and says he managed to get him into the prison. He gives him a million dollars to bribe the meeting host NOT to reveal anything to his interrogators (under Poundstone). Miller is surprised as he thought all Americans are on the same side; Martin tells him not to be naive. Miller and Freddy go to the prison and make up a story to see the meeting host. They find him severely injured from the torture. The meeting host asks Miller why he was treated like that; after all, didn't they agree at the meeting that they would be treated well? Miller asks which meeting, the meeting host says in Jordan. Meanwhile, Poundstone has gotten a Presidential order to raid the CIA office in Baghdad and retrieve the black book. Poundstone uses the black book addresses to hunt down the Iraqi guards to assassinate them.Miller goes to find Lawrie, and he puts the pieces together that the Magellan she is looking for is Al Rawi, who had earlier met Poundstone in Jordan and revealed the true status of Iraq's WMD program basically, there were none. No one verified the source or the information; she was fed it by Poundstone who used her to spread the news & propagate the myth. Miller realizes that Al Rawi is the only person now who can come out to put all into perspective, but Poundstone, in pushing his agenda of democracy, does not want his underhanded methods to surface he reneged on the promises he made to the Iraqi old guard, promising them a position in the new Iraq but actually he had no intention of doing so. If Iraq did not have an active WMD program in place, they were not a threat and the US should not have entered and basically they need to let Iraqis make up their own government (and not have US put a democracy there).The hunt for Al Rawi begins. Miller to find out the truth, and Poundstone and his men to cover the truth about WMD. Miller is captured by Al Rawi and tortured but he hears it from Al Rawi firsthand what went down in the meeting in Jordan. They are attacked and in the chase, Freddy comes out and shoots Al Rawi. He tells Miller to leave Iraq to the Iraqis to handle. Miller prepares to leave for home, but before he does so, he writes his Intel brief and sends it out to all the newspapers, saying lets get it right this time. His brief is the truth that there are no WMDs in Iraq. The democracy also fails, as none of the Iraqi groups want a puppet Iraqi president who is controlled by the US government."

His owner, Phil Winslow, works for Bark Organic dog food. Phil is very strict, from Marmaduke's perspective.One day, Carlos tells Marmaduke that he overheard Phil saying that they were being transferred to Orange County. They move from Kansas into their new house in California. Phil's boss, Don Twombly, has the goal of getting Bark Organic into every Petco store in the country. Phil and Don meet at the dog park to discuss Phil's assignment - an ad campaign to win over Petco. There, Marmaduke meets Mazie, who develops a crush on Marmaduke. He also meets Giuseppe, a Chinese Crested dog who is afraid of everything, and Raisin, a very smart but minute Dachshund.Later, Marmaduke meets a beautiful Rough Collie named Jezebel, whose boyfriend is Bosco, a violent Beauceron with two Miniature Pinscher minions named Thunder and Lightning. Bosco intimidates Marmaduke, who does not want to fight.Marmaduke and the mutts get together at night and crash a pedigrees-only party thrown by Bosco, only to be scared away by him. Marmaduke asks Mazie to help him get a girl, whom she presumes is herself but is actually Jezebel.Marmaduke has Carlos pretend to be lost in the dog park, and the two stage a fight in front of all the dogs in order to boost Marmaduke's popularity. Marmaduke then enters a dog surfing contest put together as a promotional stunt by Phil to sway Petco and beats Bosco, who is the reigning dog-surfing champion. They get into a fight, which appalls the Petco executives. As a result, Phil hires a dog trainer named Anton to help him control Marmaduke, albeit with little success at first.He then takes Jezebel on Mazie's dream date, which the latter watches from afar. While the Winslow family are on Don's boat, Marmaduke throws a party, with most residents of the dog park attending save for Mazie, Giuseppe, and Raisin. Bosco crashes the party and discovers it was Carlos at the dog park. He then exposes Marmaduke, who loses his friends. He is left with no friends and a destroyed house. When the Winslows return (having discovered Phil arranged the stay on Don's boat was so they could work on the Petco pitch) and Phil discovers the house in a wreck, he locks Marmaduke outside for the night. Marmaduke runs away, and leaves Mazie a toy that she had given him earlier. Mazie goes to Marmaduke's house, and Carlos tells her Marmaduke never returned. She then goes looking for him. Marmaduke in the meantime has met Chupadogra, a wise, elderly English Mastiff who is feared throughout Orange County for presumably eating his owner. In reality, he ran away to lead the pack, but they abandoned him. He has spent the time alone in the woods with nothing but a blanket and his old water bowl, which reads ""Buster"". Buster tells Marmaduke to go home and return to his family while he still has one, and then distracts a dog catcher. Marmaduke leaves, but gets lost.In the morning, the Winslows discover Marmaduke missing and begin searching for him. Mazie and the family find him at the same time on the streets, but Mazie falls into the subterranean rainwater conduit after the street below her collapses. Marmaduke jumps in after her and Phil tries to retrieve him, as well as the fire department. The fireman saves Mazie, but loses Marmaduke in the raging water. By this time, Phil has been fired for missing the meeting for the last chance with Petco. He then runs to the aqueduct that the conduits lead to and finds Marmaduke in the raging waters. Phil begs Marmaduke to let go of the branch he's holding onto and let the waters carry him to Phil. He reluctantly does, and is saved. Several kids got that on video and put it on YouTube. Since it generates 682,000 hits, Phil is rehired and Bark Organics got Petco. Phil then talks about moving back to Kansas, but the entire Winslow family wants to stay in California.Marmaduke later confronts the pedigrees, saying that differences shouldn't matter, that they're all dogs and should have an equal share of the park. Everyone agrees and turn on Bosco, who leaves, after revealing his fear of bees (which Marmaduke is also afraid of). Meanwhile, Phil and Don begin thinking of new commercials when they ask each other about if the dogs could talk to each other, or even dance.The finale then shows Marmaduke, Jezebel, Mazie, Giuseppe, Raisin, and Buster, among others, dancing and singing ""What I Like About You"", which turns out to be the commercial. In the end, Marmaduke and Mazie are dating, Marmaduke and Jezebel are friends, and all is well. That night, Marmaduke then farts in Phil and Debbie's bed as he winks at the camera."
Devil,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1314655/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of people are trapped in an elevator and the Devil is mysteriously amongst them. In Philadelphia, Detective Bowden is still grieving for his wife and son, killed in a hit-and-run five years ago. When someone jumps from a skyscraper onto a truck, Bowden is sent to investigate. Meanwhile, five strangers are trapped in an elevator in the building where the jumper committed suicide. The communication radio in the elevator is broken but the guards, Lustig and Ramirez, observe the individuals via CCTV as events unfold. Tensions run high among those trapped, so Lustig calls the police and Detective Bowden assumes the case. Without being able to contact the individuals, he tries to work out who they are, but he can only account for four of them. Time is running out for the occupants of the elevator, as Bowden realizes he has to get them out quickly.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In a downtown Philadelphia high-rise commercial building, 5 strangers get into the same elevator car. They're all annoyed when the elevator lurches to stop between floors. They quickly annoy one another - one doesn't like being called senile and another claims to suffer from claustrophobia - but when the lights go off and one of the five is killed, it all takes on a rather different complexion. The policeman in charge of the case is Det. Bowden, a recovering alcoholic who has yet to get over the death of his wife and child in an auto accident. As the passengers are killed, one by one, the rescuers work frantically to get access to the elevator car. One of the high-rise security guards however is convinced that it's all the work of the Devil.—garykmcd Universal Pictures New Logo 1996: ""A DIVISION OF NBC UNIVERSAL"" (23 May 1997-24 February 2012)The movie opens with a narration by Ramirez (Jacob Vargas) who mentions that his mother tells him stories of the Devil roaming the earth, and it always begins with a suicide. In Philadelphia, a man commits suicide by throwing himself from a tall skyscraper. Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) is called to the scene to aid in the investigation. Bowden is a recovering alcoholic devastated by the death of his wife and child in a hit-and-run accident by a driver who was never caught. As this is happening, five strangers, who have committed various crimes in the past, step onto an elevator located within the same building where the suicide has taken place.The five strangers include Ben Larson (Bokeem Woodbine), a temp security guard with a violent past; an elderly woman (Jenny O'Hara) who is a compulsive thief; Vince McCormick (Geoffrey Arend), a mattress salesman who moonlights as a con artist; Tony (Logan Marshall-Green), a former mechanic who served in the U.S. military during the War in Afghanistan who is now seeking employment within the building; and Sarah Caraway (Bojana Novakovic), the wife of the building security's owner meeting with her lawyer in the building.Strange things start to occur beginning with the elevator becoming stuck between floors. Then, after the lights go out, Sarah is inexplicably wounded on her back. The remaining occupants of the elevator quickly begin to suspect Vince of having committed the assault. Slowly, one by one, the five strangers start to die. Ramirez and his colleague also see a strange devil-like face appear on the screen of the security camera. First, Vince is killed by a shard of glass from a mirror which slices his jugular vein. Detective Bowden, sensing a connection between this and the man who earlier committed suicide in the same building, is compelled to further investigate. Checking the building's guest log, Bowden finds that only four people have missed their scheduled appointments that day: Sarah, Vince, Ben, and Janekowski. The investigators misinterpret the latter as Jane Kowski and assume this is the old woman's name, leaving Bowden suspicious of Tony who appears to be the only undocumented occupant.With the help of the building's security team, Bowden examines security footage and discovers that the old woman had stolen a wallet prior to entering the elevator. The office building's repairman is sent down the elevator shaft to fix it, but plummets to his death. During a power outage, a flash of an evil figure is seen. The lights turn back on to reveal the old woman gruesomely hanged with a light cable. Sarah and Ben turn on Tony, while Bowden begins to suspect that Sarah's husband has hired Ben to kill her. A security guard inspects the basement and electrocutes himself attempting to secure a hot fallen wire. The lights go out again and Ben is dead with his neck completely twisted around. Each thinking the other must be responsible for the murders, Tony and Sarah prepare to fight each other with broken glass, but Bowden seemingly manages to calm them. As Sarah prepares to take out a shard of glass hidden in her back pocket, the lights once again go out and her throat is slashed. The mystery seems solved, when a tattooed woman arrives and informs Bowden that Tony is her fiance, and was at the building for a job interview. Only then is his full name revealed to be Tony Janekowski.The old woman suddenly rises and appears behind Tony. It is now apparent that she is the Devil who has taken a human form. Having dispensed of the others, the Devil tells Tony it's his turn to die and Tony accepts it, even offering to be taken instead of Sarah, who's still struggling to breathe. Detective Bowden watches through the CCTV as Tony confesses to killing two people in a drunken hit-and-run accident. Tony had been trying to grab another beer while driving and had not seen where was going. Tony says ""I'm so sorry."" and Bowden had a car wash coupon that says ""I'm so sorry"" on the back. At which point the Devil is forced to spare him (as he confessed his sin and apologized for it) and disappears as the firemen finish breaking into the elevator. Bowden screams for the building to be searched, but the old woman is nowhere to be found. Tony is arrested for the hit-and-run and en route to the police station, Bowden reveals that Tony killed his family, but to his surprise he forgives him. The film ends with Ramirez saying, ""If the Devil is real, then God must be real, too"" as the screen fades to black.The End"
Hereafter,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1212419/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A drama centered on three people - a blue-collar American, a French journalist and a London school boy - who are touched by death in different ways. A drama centered on three people who are haunted by mortality in different ways. George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is a blue-collar American who has a special connection to the afterlife. On the other side of the world, French journalist, Marie Lelay (Cécile de France) has a near-death experience which shakes her reality, and when London schoolboy Marcus (identical twinsFrankie McLarenandGeorge McLaren) loses the person closest to him, he desperately needs answers. Each looking to understand the one thing all life has in common, but can never share, their lives will cross, changed by what they believe might, or must, exist in the hereafter.—Warner Bros. Pictures The story of three people who have been affected by death. French television journalist Marie Lelay (Cécile de France) is vacationing on an idyllic South Pacific island when a tsunami strikes. Washed away in the flood, she is rescued and survives, though she may have died before being revived. In London, a young lad named Marcus loses his twin brother Jason (identical twinsFrankie McLarenandGeorge McLaren), struck down by a truck, and is desperate to try and contact him. Lastly, San Franciscan George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is a genuine psychic who finds his ability a curse as a simple touch will provide him with information from the dead that loved ones so desperately desire. All three live a lonely existence, but when their paths cross, they all find closure of sorts.—garykmcd This movie follows three people who have their own issues with death. George Lonegan (Matt Damon), an American, who, able to speak to the dead and pass what they want their loved ones to know (what they were not able to say when they were alive), doesn't think it's a good thing. Marie Lelay (Cécile de France), a French journalist who was struck by a tsunami and survived, believes she actually died, which alters her personality and jeopardizes her career. And Marcus (identical twins Frankie McLaren and George McLaren), an English boy who's having a hard time coping with his twin brother's death.—rcs0411@yahoo.com On assignment in Thailand, French television journalist Marie Lelay (Cécile de France) becomes a victim of the devastating December 26, 2004, Indian Ocean tsunami. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated by rescuers and, after left for dead, gasps back to life, but not before having a near-death experience, a vision of human figures inhabiting a realm of light. Marie and her lover, Didier (Thierry Neuvic), are soon reunited as the disaster subsides, and they return to Paris. Marie's experience, however, interferes with her work performance to the point that Didier (who is also her producer) sells her on taking a leave of absence to write a book they've discussed, which would add to her prestige.
In London, England, 12-year-old twins Marcus and Jason (Frankie McLaren and George McLaren) try desperately to prevent their alcoholic, heroin-addicted mother, Jackie (Lyndsey Marshal), from losing them to social services. After evading the authorities yet again, the boys' mother sends Jason to the chemist (pharmacist) to pick up her de-tox prescription. On the way home, Jason is attacked by street thugs and, while trying to escape, is hit by a van and killed. No longer able to protect his mother, and barely able to cope with life without the brother he idolizes, Marcus is sent to a foster home.
In San Francisco, former professional psychic George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is persuaded against his wishes to perform a reading for his brother Billy's (Jay Mohr) wealthy client, Christos (Richard Kind). A genuine clairvoyant with a gift for communicating with the dead, George abandoned his old career because he was unable to deal with the emotional impact of the reunions and the often disturbingly intimate family secrets revealed. While doing the reading, George hears the name June. Christos at first denies that it means anything but privately reveals to Billy that June was the name of his late wife's nurse, whom he loved for ten of the fifteen years she was his wife's caregiver, but out of embarrassment and shame never told anyone, least of all June herself.
Now book-writing with more time to contemplate her near-death experience, Marie travels to Switzerland to meet a renowned specialist in the field. As the director of a hospice who has seen her share of dying patients, the doctor describes herself as a former skeptic who was convinced by the evidence that the afterlife exists and that people like Marie have had a genuine view of it. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience in the hope that the scientific community will ultimately accept the reality of life beyond death.
Desperate for one last reunion with his twin brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents (Niamh Cusack and George Costigan (I)) and goes around London seeking someone to help him contact Jason. He encounters only frauds and pretenders. While trying to board the underground at Charing Cross, Marcus's (or rather Jason's) cap seems blown off his head. Delayed by trying to find it, he misses his train and sees it explode in the tunnel during the July 7, 2005 London Bombings.
George enrolls in a cooking class taught by one of San Francisco's leading chefs. Its students are paired-up, resulting in George being partnered with a young woman named Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard). The two soon hit it off and after their second class agree on stopping for a bite. Instead, they decide to put their new culinary skills to use by preparing an Italian dinner for themselves at George's place. That begins well until they hear an ill-timed phone message from his brother, which inclines George to reveal his past as a psychic to Melanie. Curious, she presses George to do a reading for her. George explains his reluctance but goes through with it. They contact the spirit of Melanie's father, who ends the session by asking her forgiveness for ""what he did"" to her as a child. Melanie flees George's home in tears, and she doesn't return to the cooking class.
Having been in talks with a publisher before her trip to Thailand about a biography of François Mitterrand, Marie now stuns them with her new manuscript entitled ""Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence."" The publisher (Jean-Yves Berteloot) rejects the manuscript. Later realizing her passion for the subject, he phones that evening to steer her toward other publishers who might be interested, the most promising of them being in London.
George is laid off from his factory job and, still heartbroken over the fiasco with Melanie, rejects his brother's push to revive his psychic practice and impulsively leaves San Francisco to find a new start somewhere else. He travels to London, where, being a great admirer of Charles Dickens (listening nightly to audiobook readings of Dickens' works), he visits the Dickens Museum and to a live reading of Dickens by Derek Jacobi at the London Book Fair that same day. There, one of the presenters was Marie reading her now-published book. While handing to George the copy she signed to him, their hands touch and George has a psychic flash of Marie's tsunami drowning, confirming the truth of her writing.
Meanwhile, Marcus and his foster parents, along with the boy's social-worker overseers, head to the London Book Fair to meet up with the child's foster parents' former foster child, who is a now a successful young man. Asking leave of them, Marcus looks around the fair and spots George, of whom he has read and seen online. Marcus tries to stop George, who emphatically brushes him off and returns to his hotel. Marcus follows him and stands resolutely outside the hotel until nightfall, waiting for George to come out. Eventually George brings him in and agrees to do his reading.
Through George, after telling Marcus how happy he is and that the afterlife is more wonderful than Marcus can imagine, deceased Jason imparts a sterner message, telling Marcus that he cannot look after him anymore and that it is time Marcus starts looking after himself and needs not fear being alone, ""because they are one."" George begins to lose contact and Marcus tearfully pleads for Jason to stay. Jason returns and tells Marcus that he wants him to stop wearing the cap, as it was his, not Marcus's. In the train station wind, it was Jason who knocked his cap off because it was his cap and not Marcus's and was glad he did because it kept Marcus off the doomed train and that's the last time he will look after him. George loses contact again and Marcus resumes begging Jason to return - to no avail. As Marcus leaves, he tells George he is sorry about ""the French woman"" as he could tell that ""you like her."" The last we see of Marcus, he shows a much greater strength of character and visits his mother in the rehab center.
Marie learns from Didier that he does not intend on having her back at the job he urged her to take leave of. He is, in fact, having an affair with the woman who replaced her on the TV news program (and on its billboards).
In his hotel room, George is told by Marcus via phone what hotel Marie is staying in. George goes there and writes a note to her. After reading it, she accepts its invitation from a reader of her book who knows her story is true and would like to meet her over lunch. The reader turns out to be George. While watching her scan the crowd to find him, George has a touchingly reassuring vision of them holding hands and kissing, without his gift interfering, which is confirmed when they shake hands in meeting and there is no psychic linking. Their shared glimpses of the hereafter have made them appreciate this life all the more and the movie ends with them sitting down at a cafe, and starting to talking."
When in Rome,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185416/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Beth is a young, ambitious New Yorker who is completely unlucky in love. However, on a whirlwind trip to Rome, she impulsively steals some coins from a reputed fountain of love, and is then aggressively pursued by a band of suitors. Beth is a hard working career woman whose last relationship says that she puts her work above him so he left her. When he tells her he found another career woman and is willing to stick it out with her and is engaged to her, Beth feels that there is no one for her. And when she goes to Rome to attend her sister's impromptu wedding and after meeting the best man, Nick, she's attracted to him but after seeing him with another woman, she gets drunk and goes into the famed Fountain of Love and takes some coins thrown by people looking for love. When she goes back to New York four men start coming onto her. And Nick keeps calling her asking her out. She later learns that what she did--is a no no. It seems legend says, that if you take a coin out of the fountain, the person who threw it will fall in love with who took the coin, so she has to find a way to break the curse. She wonders if Nick, whom she likes, is with her BEcause he wants to or if he is under the spell.—rcs0411@yahoo.com The scene opens panning along a revolving holder for travel cards for the city of Rome. Pausing briefly on one card's image of a fountain in the middle of a neighborhood plaza, the scene quickly shifts to this fountain, in the evening, with people sitting around it or strolling by. Coins are seen being thrown into the fountain by young lovers wishing for a happy relationship.The image shifts again to the postcard image for the fountain, known as 'Fountain of Love,' and then pans up along the card holder to show cards for New York City along the top. The card holder spins and the scene shifts to the New York City skyline, again in the evening.We arrive at the scene of a major gala exhibit at the Guggenheim Museum, which has been organized and put together by one of the curators, Beth Martin (Kristen Bell), who joins a few of her co-workers at their table. Beth finds to her chagrin that her ex-boyfriend, Brady Sacks (Lee Pace), has also shown up at the event. She turns reluctantly to greet him, and as she forces a smile, it's quickly seen there is a piece of spinach stuck between her upper front teeth.Brady has come to admit to Beth, after a very long time, that he accepts that he did a number of bad things during their relationship, has learned from his mistakes, and is ready to give romance another try. The way Brady words it softens Beth's skepticism and she looks like she's ready to try a reconciliation-- until Brady springs the news that he's met another woman and has gotten engaged with her. Beth's co-workers misunderstand Brady's announcement and think that Beth has just agreed to marry Brady, and then, making it even worse, the DJ for the event overhears and announces it to all the guests. Quickly the party's liveliness kicks up a notch until Beth announces that the rumor is untrue, but 'maybe someday, with someone else.' Topping the humiliation for the night off for Beth, the heel of her left boot breaks off and she has to walk home that way.Beth arrives home, exhausted, wanting nothing more than to crawl into bed and sleep, and forget about the day. But suddenly there is a knock on her door; it's her sister, Joan (Alexis Dziena), who beams at her and flashes an engagement ring on her hand. Again Beth has to force a smile as Joan rushes forward to hug her.Joan's fiance is an Italian man named Umberto, whom she met on a flight to Italy only two weeks ago-- and now they're getting married, in Rome. Beth fixes drinks for herself and Joan and they start to talk. The conversation touches on such things as Beth loving her job enough that she'd need to find someone she loves even more (a male version of herself, Joan offers), and Joan feeling so sure in her heart that she's met her soul mate that she doesn't need further 'proof,' even though she's only known him for two weeks.Beth tries to convince Joan that she's really happy for her, but the next day at work, as she's talking with one of her co-workers from the previous night, Stacy (Kate Micucci), she shows her true colors and prattles about how she feels her sister is making the biggest mistake of her life.Beth sits down to attend a meeting, and the president of the museum, Celeste (Anjelica Huston), announces that in nine days, the museum will be holding its largest annual event, the Board of Trustees' Annual Circle of Gold gala. This year, the special installation for the event was designed by Beth (whom Celeste refers to as the youngest and least-experienced curator), an exhibition on the theme of pain.Asked for a status report, Beth announces that all but one piece, the Slater Bradley, have either arrived or are en route. The Slater Bradley is the centerpiece, and its acquisition has run into 'last minute insurance issues,' an explanation that Celeste notes with displeasure and skepticism. Beth promises the piece will be acquired in time for the gala, but quickly brings up one small detail: Joan's wedding, in two days. Celeste's icy stare quickly shows that the announcement has quickly put Beth into some major hot water, although it's clear by now that Celeste is not very fond of Beth to begin with and scrutinizes her more carefully than the other curators.Beth arrives in Rome for Joan's wedding, planning on only staying 48 hours (a promise she'd made Celeste). If Beth's life was not complicated enough, the driver for her taxi seems more interested in giving her a tour of the 'most romantic city in the world' than getting her to her destination on time. Presently he pulls up in front of the Fontana d'Amore, the Fountain of Love, which is near to the chapel where Joan's wedding is taking place. Beth rushes to greet her mother, Priscilla (Peggy Lipton), and Joan outside the chapel. Priscilla is divorced from Beth's father (Don Johnson, uncredited, whose name isn't given during the movie), referring to his girlfriends as 'tramps.' Beth kisses her father hello, and then Joan introduces Beth to Umberto (Luca Calvani).The wedding gets off to an awkward start; Umberto's best man, Nick Beamon (Josh Duhamel), arrives late and his mobile phone starts ringing with a loud ring tone ('Cherry Pie') as he's coming down the aisle (Beth, whose phone has been getting poor to no reception since she landed in Rome, is immediately curious). Nick notices Beth glancing at her, and she smiles briefly at him.During the reception, Beth struggles to keep a mobile phone connection with Stacy, trying to discern if she's staying on top of the Slater-Bradley exhibit centerpiece. Of course, with the setting (a wedding reception) and location (Rome), references to Beth's still-unmarried status can't escape her. Her father, interrupting her call, talks about the intimate setting of the wedding and drops a very unsubtle hint that he'd like to throw another wedding party soon, for Beth. Trying to placate her father, who knows how hardheaded Beth is about falling in love, she promises to try and be open to it next time it comes along.Joan comes up to them to announce a small ritual that Beth, as maid of honor, needs to perform: she needs to throw a vase against the floor, shattering it, and the number of pieces it breaks into symbolizes how many years of happiness she wishes for the bride and groom. Of course, Beth screws the ritual up badly, merely dropping the vase to the floor, and it doesn't break at all. Trying to make it up to Joan, she picks the vase up and tries much harder to smash it against the dais that Joan and Umberto are standing on, only to find to her shock that the vase is unusually durable and hard; she can't break it. Frustrated, she flings the vase across the reception hall and it knocks down Umberto's grandmother (Judith Malina), a superstitious old woman who announces in great distress that Beth has wished Umberto and his new wife, many years of great tragedy. Now desperate, Beth grabs a microphone stand and tries to crush the vase with it, again proving completely unsuccessful. Finally Nick comes to her rescue, picking up the vase and hurling it against a pillar, where it smashes into many little pieces.Beth must now give a speech on behalf of the bride and groom, She stammers on her words, not speaking any Italian, so Nick comes up beside her and offers to translate, long as Beth keeps her words simple. Beth gives a moving tribute to her sister as having grown from a little girl who believed in magic, into a grown woman who's seen all the magic in the world come true. Of course, Nick horribly mistranslates Beth's moving wish that Joan would one day share some of the magic with her, to 'perhaps she'll share him (meaning Umberto) with me.'Beth and Nick start to talk after the toast has been given (Umberto's grandmother spits at Beth's feet as she passes by), and Nick mentions he learned his limited proficiency in Italian at Syracuse University, where he and Umberto were roommates. Beth suddenly asks Nick who his phone's provider is, trying to explain that she's having signal problems, and she's really hoping Nick would let her send a quick work email on his phone. Nick doesn't want to do this, thinking Beth is going to use his phone to call her own phone, which would save his number in its memory.The wedding priest, Father Dino (Keir O'Donnell), comes up to them, greeting Nick and offering to play a few more rounds of poker with him; an offer Nick declines because Father Dino cleaned him out at poker during Umberto's bachelor party (Father Dino feels guilty about it, being a newly ordained priest). Later, during a wedding dance, Beth finds that Nick doesn't see much more hope for Joan's marriage to Umberto, than Beth herself does (Nick makes the same remark about two weeks not being enough time for a credit check, that Beth had made to Stacy, causing Beth to stare at him in shock). Nick pulls Beth into the dance and she starts to have real fun at it, but it's cut short as Nick kicks a foot up and kicks a drink tray out of the hands of a passing waiter, and the drink glasses break against a floor multi-outlet for several plugs, shorting them all out and plunging the reception hall into darkness. The lights are restored and the band begins playing a slower song for a slow dance, and Nick suddenly finds his mobile phone in Beth's hand, He quickly grabs it back and pushes it into his inside jacket pocket. Beth dances with Nick again, finding out his peripheral vision is slightly impaired after he was hit by lightning while playing football in college (something he's pretty self-conscious about). Nick remarks that Beth isn't quite as tough as she tries to make herself out as. Beth looks up at Nick and it looks like she's starting to lean up to kiss him, when suddenly Priscilla calls for Beth to participate in cutting the wedding cake. Priscilla unashamedly tells Beth that Nick looks nice, but so did Beth's father... a remark that has Nick again looking awkward.Still later, Beth is standing on a stairway landing above the reception floor and sees Nick looking around for her. Remembering the promise she made her father, she starts to follow him out, holding a bottle and a glass of wine to share with him. As she steps outisde the chapel, she sees a beautiful Italian woman in a long red dress walk up to Nick and kiss him. Shocked, and suddenly not wanting to be caught staring, she ducks behind a statue on the edge of the plaza. Hiding behind it, she peeks out and sees Nick bringing the woman back into the chapel. Saying, 'of course!' to herself, she takes a big swig of wine directly from the bottle.Beth sits on the edge of the fountain, kicks off her shoes and drinks more wine. Looking around the plaza with shifty eyes and finding nobody looking in her direction, she turns and dips her feet into the fountain water, continuing to swig from the bottle. Looking at the female statue that is the centerpiece of the fountain, Beth, who has started to get inebriated, starts telling the fountain off about the fickle nature of love and how the man she's long awaited to sweep her off her feet, isn't coming. Looking down, she sees all the coins thrown into the fountain by people who have made wishes for love and rants to herself how she thinks it's all phony.Suddenly Beth reaches down and plucks one of the coins out of the fountain, holding it up and staring at it. Suddenly there's a rumble of thunder from the sky and a man sitting at the plaza snaps his head up, looking at Beth. Beth plucks a few more coins out of the fountain and each time, another man about the plaza snaps up and stares at her. Each coin she plucks out, to Beth, is someone she's rescuing from the 'temptation' of false love. Finally she picks up a poker chip. As she does, Nick exits the chapel again, passing by Father Dino who's hurrying back inside. Nick sees Beth turning slowly in circles on her feet while standing in the fountain, and gives her the same odd stare. Before he can approach her, however, two Italian police on horseback enter the plaza and chase Beth off.Beth arrives back home in New York to find her phone ringing... it's Nick, who's gotten her number from Joan and is looking to invite Beth to dinner, or even just a cup of coffee. The conversation occurs while Nick is at a friend's house for a poker game and his poker buddies are all super-impatient (he'd gone to the kitchen to bring a six-pack of beer for them all). Bewildered at Beth's rebuff, Nick returns to the card game with the bottle opener, but without the beer bottles. His buddies all suspect he called a woman during the game. Meanwhile, Beth fishes the coins she'd swiped from the fountain, out of her purse and puts them in a small decoratie bowl in her room.The next day Beth is jogging through a park when she happens to run past Antonio Donatello (Will Arnett), an artist, one of the men who'd turned suddenly when Beth was grabbing coins from the fountain. His sketch is of a woman who looks something like Beth, but Antonio suddenly notes he's drawn the women with overly large feet. Disgustedly throwing the sketch aside, he starts chasing Beth, shouting in a broken mix of Italian and English that he needs to 'see her feet' (a number of people turn to stare, and Beth starts to run faster). Finally he trips over a horse-drawn carrige, taking a hard tumble to the ground. This gets Beth's attention and she runs back to make sure he's okay. The carriage driver picks up a sketch pad that had fallen out of Antonio's satchel and finds that it's filled with drawings of Beth. Antonio desperately tries to explain how he had a vision of the face of love-- Beth's face. He's come all the way to New York to create a perfect sketch of Beth, in hopes of winning her heart. Freaked out, Beth turns and runs off.Later, Beth is at a diner when suddenly another of the men from the fountain scene strikes up a conversation... Gale (Dax Shepard), a model, who's only too happy to show Beth his portfolio. Beth gets freaked out again says she has to get going, and Gale responds by shamelessly pulling off his tank-top shirt right in front of her, making a fool of himself in front of all the other diner patrons as Beth runs away again.Walking back through the plaza, Beth accidentally(?) bumps across another of the men from the Fountain... Lance (Jon Heder), a street magician. As she walks past him, he calls out to her and holds out her wristwatch that she 'dropped.' But twice as she retrieves it and heads on her way, it's suddenly back in Lance's hand. A small crowd gathers, thinking he's putting on a magic show. Lance does a card trick that turns out to be a romantic pitch professing his feelings for Beth. Beth freaks out as he suddenly seems to reach into his chest to withdraw his heart, though it turns out to be a fake heart which contains the card Beth picked from the deck.Beth arrives back at work, dazedly asking Stacy if the whole city has gone bonkers. Stacy tells Beth that Joan is on the phone. Joan is holding a copy of a local Italian newspaper, the front page is plastered with a headine reading 'Stupidissima' over a photo of Beth at the Fountain of Love. When Umberto overhears Beth telling Joan that she got drunk and took a few coins from the fountain, he warns Beth about a local folk legend, that if someone takes a coin out of the fountain that was thrown in by someone else that was looking for love, it will make the person that threw the coin, fall hopelessly in love with the one who took it back out. Beth thinks the legend is ridiculous, until Stacy (who's been listening in), realizes that a number of men have already come on to Beth since the wedding.If Stacy wasn't in enough trouble with Beth already, she then tells Beth that Hillman & Craft, the insurance company handling the Slater Bradley piece tried to raise the insurance prices too high, so Stacy told them to 'shove it,' meaning that there is no way the piece can now clear customs in time for the Circle of Gold gala, and Beth will have no centerpiece for it. Now Beth has to tell this to Celeste, which will likely put Beth's job on the line.And then, to top this all off, Beth's cell phone rings-- it's Nick again... and he's in the building, Beth running smack into him en route to Celeste's office. Beth has no time to stop and chat, trying to tell him that she just lost the centerpiece for her show.But just at that moment, Celeste comes up and introduces Al Russo (Danny DeVito), the first of the men whose coin Beth took from the fountain. Celeste tells Beth that Al is the museum's newest patron, and has come specifically looking to speak to Beth... and Al also happens to recognize Nick from 'the hit' (by lightning) at the football game. Celeste asks Beth about the Slater Bradley. Beth now has to own up to her failure, when Nick suddenly announces that another renowned artist, Damian Petrocelli, personally gave Nick a rare photograph entitled Anguish, and even burned the negative for it, because the photo is of Nick taking 'the hit' and he's willing to submit it as the Gala centerpiece for Beth's sake (Al is seen wincing as Nick says this).Beth is giving Al a tour of some the museum's artwork, when he pulls a gift bag out of his briefcase, for her. The bag has a package of hot dog sausages, from a company Al runs; his face is part of the brand logo. Beth starts to freak out again as he realizes that Al is coming on to her in a strong and unashamedly foolish way, much like Antonio, Gale and Lance.Scared to walk out the front door of the museum, Beth sneaks to the service entrance, peeking warily through the porthole windows in the the service doors. Satisfied nobody's waiting in ambush, she steps out and takes two steps-- right into Nick. On instinct, she squirts him in the face with her breath spray, instantly struck with remorse when she realizes it's him, until she finds that he was only acting and that it wasn't really hurting his eyes. Nick follows Beth down the street, puzzled by her sudden coldness toward him. When she finally confronts him about the woman in the red dress, he says that she was a cousin of Umberto's and that his whole family is passionate, which made her kiss look like more than the simple greeting he took it as. Beth is disbelieving, but quickly forgets all about it when Antonio suddenly shouts to her from across the street, and Al Russo is also running up. Desperate to get away from them all, Beth leaves a frustrated Nick behind.Beth arrives home, talking to Joan on her cell phone. Beth doesn't know what to believe anymore, and only wants the whole nightmare to end. A little smugly, Joan says that Beth has to return the coins she took, to the Fountain of Love. Beth is elated at this news, until Umberto mentions that sending the coins to Joan via overnight mail wouldn't suffice-- Beth has to personally return to Rome and put the coins back into the fountain herself. Of course, Beth doesn't see how she can hurry off to Italy at a moment's notice, until she finally turns and sees Lance hanging upside down from her living room ceiling, wrapped up like a mummy; hoping to do an escape trick that will 'prove himself' to her... while Lance's assistant, Juan (Efren Ramirez, uncredited) films it all on videocamera.Nick is at work talking with Puck (Bobby Moynihan), from the poker game, who's also one of his co-workers at the Daily News, where Nick is a sports writer. Nick tells Puck that he can't make the ESPN party that Saturday. Puck is shocked to hear this and knows it must be because of Beth. Nick admits he can't stop thinking about Beth; she's much more than a pretty face, she's also very witty and smart with a personality that draws him like a magnet. Puck finally insists that Nick let him do a 'little recon' on Beth, because Puck is convinced that Nick is just smitten with a blind crush and not running on all his cylinders.Puck discreetly takes a photograph of Beth while she's jogging through downtown Brooklyn again, where Gale trots up beside her wearing a nearly identical outfit. She pauses at a corner where a group of people are using their phone cams to take a picture of an artist speed-painting a huge mural along a wall-- it's Antonio, making a mural of a nude Beth. In Celeste's office, during a meeting with her, Beth is distracted as she sees Lance seemingly levitating up to the window. Nick arrives at the museum with flowers for Beth, only to find nearly a hundred floral arrangements already placed for her there. Beth peeks out to see Nick dejectedly handing his bouquet to Stacy. A delivery man brings a basket package of sausage and bratwurst to Beth, from Al. Beth walks down the street to see a passing bus painted with a model photo of Gale, who is standing right nearby, more impressed with himself than Beth is with him. Puck photographs the scene.But the most trouble Beth is in, is from Celeste, who knows about the mural and the flowers, and is deeply concerned about the last minute change in the Gala centerpiece. She makes it very clear that unless the gala goes off without a hitch, Beth will be fired and banned from ever stepping foot on museum grounds even as a visitor. Meanwhile, Puck delivers all the incriminating photos he's taken to Nick, and is dumbfounded when Nick only says, 'I've got to pick up my game.' He calls Beth while she's overseeing the setup of part of the Gala exhibit and uses her need for the Petrocelli he promised her, as extortion to get her to have dinner with him that night at a restaurant on Bleecker street. Feeling full of himself, Nick fails to spot the tree until he walks smack into it and goes down.Beth meets Nick in the restaurant 'Blackout,' which has a sensory-deprivation theme: the dining room is pitch black so the patrons can't see their own hand in front of their faces; the restaurant staff all fitted with infrared night goggles to help them see. Wine is poured for Nick and Beth, and they start to relax and finally begin to feel the mood of the restaurant's dark room. Until it's spoiled when it's found that Al, Gale, Antonio and Lance are all there, all wearing staff night goggles, all confronting each other and Nick over Beth's affections.Beth manages to crawl out of the dining room and hurries away. Catching up to her, Nick offers to share a cab and bring her anywhere she feels safe so she can tell him what's going on.That place, of course, is in the Guggenheim Museum. She brings him to a painting made by Picasso and tells him a story about the painting, a woman named Marie-Therese who was one of his lovers, thirty years his junior, who was swept off her feet and fell deeply in love with him, but Picasso, who left his wife for her, soon left her in turn for another, still younger woman. She hung herself after Picasso passed away. Beth finally admits that she sees herself as a version of Marie-Therese, because she's gotten badly hurt every time she's tried to find love. Nick can only say that he's real, and his feelings for her are real. Frightened as she is, Beth finds herself kissing him.Nick brings Beth to his house to give her the Petrocelli photograph. He tells her his own story, about how much football meant to him during his school days, and to his whole family, especially his father. In that one moment when he was hit by the lightning on the field during a game, all that came crashing to an end, and that was the true 'hit.' This story touches Beth and she starts kissing him again, more passionately than at the museum. But suddenly Beth sees several stacks of poker chips on Nick's desk (used during his games with Puck). She picks one up and sees to her horror that it's a perfect match for the poker chip she took out of the fountain. Awkwardly, she hurries out, telling Nick only that he'd never be able to understand or believe her, but all of 'this' wasn't real. She leaves without taking the photograph, saying she doesn't want to see him in pain.Beth and Stacy are preparing for the gala, Stacy trying to keep Beth chipper even though Beth knows she's probably going to lose her job. Joan calls with great news; Umberto has heard from his grandmother that Beth can break the love spell by returning the coins directly to the men who threw them into the fountain. This way she doesn't have to return them to the fountain in Rome. Beth is delighted to hear this... but while she's talking, Stacy, who hears the whole conversation, quietly takes the coins from the bowl and hides them among some boxes she's carrying, containing more items for the gala exhibit.After Stacy leaves to start setting up, a knock sounds at Beth's door. Al, Gale, Antonio and Lance are all there. Thinking it's the perfect chance for her to return all the coins in one shot, she lets them all in. She has them sit on the couch and clumsily tries to explain that they only think they love her because she tooks their coins from the fountain, while the one person she loves is Nick. Beth is relieved when her four suitors seem to understand what it means to love someone who doesn't love them back (like Beth believes Nick doesn't truly love her back), and goes to her bowl to return their coins, but then finds them missing, and knows that Stacy was the culprit. Suddenly a massive thunderclap rocks the city. Beth turns on the TV and sees a news report about a huge storm that has knocked out a power grid and has brought much of New York City to a standstill; traffic lights aren't functioning right and travel is difficult. But that doesn't deter Beth's suitors, who all pile, with Beth, into Antonio's Italian car (super small) for a wild and bumpy ride to the museum... right through the doors, seemingly parted by Lance's 'magic' (really just a man who hit a switch to open them so he could push a woman in a wheelchair through), and right into the elevator.Beth arrives in the gala room and is stunned to see everyone applauding at the Petrocelli photograph of 'the hit,' which Nick had sent ahead to the museum. Even Celeste is pleased far greater than Beth ever imagined she would be with her; the gala has produced a record number of financial pledges to the museum, making Celeste proud of Beth's work as a curator.Beth sees Stacy and begs her for the coins. She points out that if she takes the love of any of her suitors against their will, it's not love at all. Meanwhile, Nick and Puck are at a bar, but Nick can't hang out with Puck; he has Beth on his mind and is driven to meet her at the museum.As he walks out, Beth calls him to thank him for all he's done, cryptically saying that he's made her believe in love again, and it's all been real for her, even if it wasn't for him. Getting desperate, Nick starts to sprint down the street.Beth is returning the coins to her suitors. Lance remembers that he never had the guts to perform in public until he did it for Beth-- she was his muse. Al remembers that he threw the coin into the fountain hoping for another taste of how he felt during his days as a happily married man, until his wife left him. Antonio turns out to be Anthony, a resident of Newark, New Jersey, who's been in the retail shoe business for nine years, and went to Italy desperately hoping to find an inner passion that would help him become an artist, his life's dream... a dream he can realize after Beth gives him her professional stamp of approval as a museum curator. Gale is still the obnoxious, self-centered snob he's always been, but feels he had a blast throughout the whole thing, even if Beth is dumping him now.Meanwhile, Nick is racing desperately through the storm to reach the museum. He's hit by a car rushing across a street... it's Puck, come to get him to the museum for Nick's sake, even though Puck hates Beth for ruining the 'poker-buddy' and co-worker relationship (as Puck believes) between himself and Nick.Beth has one more coin to return... Nick's poker chip. She finds Lance doing sleight of hand with it. She bats it out of his hand and it rolls away down the great spiral atrium of the Guggenheim, Beth chasing it until it comes to a stop when it hits Nick's foot. Nick picks the chip up and Beth is relieved, thinking all her suitors will leave her be.But Nick insists that whatever Beth believes about other men being under some spell, he's only under one spell-- Beth. He ran all the way up Fifth Avenue to meet her because he loves her. Stunned, Beth walks into his arms, kissing Nick.Cut to a wedding invitation for Beth and Nick... in the same chapel that Joan and Umberto got married at. Anthony, Al, Gale and Lance are all attending (Al is seen getting cozy with Celeste). Lance goes to see Beth with something for her.It's a poker chip. During the sleight of hand trick with Nick's poker chip, he got it mixed up with the others that he was using as part of the props. Beth looks at the chip with horror, thinking that Nick really is still under the Fountain of Love spell. Joan desperately tries to comfort Beth, but time is out... their father is coming to get them for the ceremony. Beth desperately tries to probe her father for advice on love and not getting hurt, and is reassured when he tells her that only the risk involved in love creates the passion, and she can't learn from his mistakes; only her own.Beth's father walks her down the aisle. Father Dino begins to recite the ceremony. But as he pauses after asking whether anyone should state why Beth and Nick shouldn't be married, Beth loses her resolve. Father Dino's clumsily muffing up the words of the ceremony and almost seeming to stall for time doesn't help, either. Beth finally starts to cry, and hands Nick back the poker chip, saying she can't do this to him. Tearfully she rushes out of the chapel as everyone stares in shock.Beth rushes to the Fountain of Love. She gets into the water, berating the statue in the fountain for everything that's happened to her ever since the took the coins; asking if it enjoyed watching her life turn upside down, and admitting that she did, herself. As she's pouring her heart out, Nick comes rushing up to her. Puzzled, he asks why she keeps giving him back his poker chips. Beth says she doesn't want to keep the love that Nick wished for by throwing the chips into the fountain. Even more puzzled, Nick says he did no such thing, and has no idea who did. Beth finally starts to realize that Nick's feelings for her are the real thing. To show her proof of this, he climbs into the fountain with her and drops the chip into the water.Behind them, they hear a loud cry of gratitude and see Father Dino dropping to his knees on the outside plaza, crying out 'free of temptation' in thanks, before rushing off giddily. Beth grins in surprise and suddenly remembers Nick telling her that Father Dino cleaned him out at poker during Umberto's bachelor party, meaning the Priest was the culprit who put the chip in the fountain. Giggling with delight, she starts to kiss Nick passionately. As they kiss, the view pans back until we are looking at them through the viewport of a video camera, and the scene shifts to show Juan, Lance's assistant, holding the camera.The movie closes with Beth and Nick getting out of a tiny Italian car as newlyweds, and most of the main cast doing a lively (if slightly silly) wedding dance number as the credits roll."
Love & Other Drugs,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758752/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1990s Pittsburgh, a medicine peddler starts a relationship with a young woman suffering from Parkinson's disease. Maggie (Hathaway) is an alluring free spirit who won't let anyone - or anything - tie her down. But she meets her match in Jamie (Gyllenhaal), whose relentless and nearly infallible charm serve him well with the ladies and in the cutthroat world of pharmaceutical sales. Maggie and Jamie's evolving relationship takes them both by surprise, as they find themselves under the influence of the ultimate drug: love.—Twentieth Century Fox 1996. Jamie dallies with the manager's wife and loses his job selling electronics. He takes his smile to Pfizer, becoming a drug rep in Pittsburgh. While trying to convince an internist to prescribe Zoloft instead of Prozac, Jamie meets Maggie, whose wit and energetic sex without attachment match his feckless charm. Early-onset Parkinson's adds to her mistrust of attachments. Jamie starts to fall for her about the time Viagra hits the market and makes him a sales superstar. When he becomes her knight errant in quest of a cure, she makes it clear that pity, entangling alliances, and being defined by her disease are off the table. Can't she just have fun?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Pittsburgh, 1996. Jamie (Jake Gyllenhall) is seen working in an electronics store. He's talking and flirting with women of all ages into buying phones and stereos while flirting with the store owner's girlfriend, Christy. Jamie and Christy sneak into the back to have sex and she accidentally calls her boyfriend on the intercom phone and he hears them everything. After getting punched in the face by his boss, Jamie runs out of the store (stopping to flirt with a woman, named Amber, on the way out).Later that night, Jamie is at his parents house for dinner. His father and his sister are doctors and his bumbling brother, Josh, is rich from owning a medical software company. At dinner, Josh and his wife fight and he brings up Jamie getting fired and the family gets on him for dropping out of med school. Jamie blows them off and brings up that Josh is going to help him get set up as a pharmaceutical sales rep.With Josh's help, Jamie goes to work for Pfizer after he attends several seminar classes. After that, Jamie goes out practicing his sales pitch and trying to get doctors to prescribe Zoloft and Zithromax. He is rebuffed constantly by doctors much to the dismay of his business partner and supervisor Bruce (Oliver Platt) who sees Jamie as his ticket to the ""big leagues"" of Chicago so Bruce can be near his wife and kids. Bruce tells Jamie if he can get Dr. Knight (Hank Azaria) to prescribe Zoloft instead of Prozac then all the other doctors will follow his lead. After trying to chat Dr. Knight up several times unsuccessfully, Jamie flirts with his receptionists and sneaks into the back medicine cabinets to steal all of the Prozac samples and throw them in the dumpster.Over the next few days, Jamie is still unable to raise his sales so he pays Dr. Knight a bribe of $1,000 to let him shadow him. The doctor accepts and Jamie spends the day babbling about how Zoloft is better than Prozac.Dr. Knight goes in to see a patient and Jamie (wearing a white lab coat) pretends to be an intern. Knight's patient is Maggie (Anne Hathaway) a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with an early onset of Parkinson's Disease. Maggie tells Jamie that someone broke into her house and stole all her medication and she gives him a long list of refills that she needs. While there, Maggie asks Dr Knight, while Jamie looks on, to look at a weird lump on her breast, which turns out to be a spider bite.Later in the parking lot, Maggie stops Jamie while he is throwing away the Prozac medication that he stole from Dr. Knight's medicine closet, and punches him in the face for pretending to be an intern and for looking at her breast. She takes his picture with an instant camera and leaves.Jamie comes home to find Josh who has split from his wife and wants to stay with him for a few weeks while he finds a place to live. Jamie calls Dr. Knight's receptionist (who he is sleeping with) and gets Maggie's address and home phone number. He calls Maggie and asks her out for coffee. At first she says 'no', but then she gives in and meets him. The date is basically him being charming and her being rude. After 10 minutes, they head back to her apartment and have very casual sex. Afterwards, she kicks him out right away and we see a montage of Jamie getting booty calls and him and Maggie having sex everywhere and whenever she calls him. Maggie even once shows up one night at Jamie's apartment, stark nude under a coat for sex, only to have Jamie's brother/roommate Josh, wakening where he was sleeping on the living room couch, see all of her.Later at work, Jamie is throwing away the Prozac pills in a parking lot dumpster when he looks up to get punched in the face by Trey (Gabriel Macht), the hot-tempered rep for Prozac. Trey is the top seller in the region and gives the doctors and staff big kickbacks (trips to Florida and Hawaii) for pushing Prozac. He says he knows what Jamie is doing and that he will take him down if he doesn't stop. Trey and Jamie fight some more and he leaves Jamie on the ground after telling him to stay way from Maggie.Jamie gets take-out food and goes to see Maggie at her downtown loft. After briefly discussing Trey (he's married but was seeing her on the side) and Maggie's Parkinson's (she's a waitress in a small coffee shop and has no health insurance) they start to have sex but Jamie is unable to get erect for the occasion. After a few kind words from Maggie, they just hang out and she teases him that he should use some new erection drug that his company has developed. The next day before Jamie leaves, Maggie begins having problems with tremors in her left hand, which she hides from him as she pushes him out the door. Jamie approaches Bruce about the new drug and Bruce says he will look into it.At work, Jamie gets the green light to sell Viagra and suddenly he is extremely popular and the doctors pursue him.Back at his apartment, Maggie and Jamie talk and he tries to convince her to have a relationship with him. She says no and leaves. The next day, Maggie is helping senior citizens onto a bus to go to Canada to get cheap prescription drugs when Jamie shows up. They argue about their relationship some more and she leaves. Jamie waits in the parking lot for her to come back and the next day when the bus does come back Maggie is touched that he waited for over 24 hours. Maggie tells him that she will have a relationship with him but that she gets to hate him and slam him to her girlfriends when he dumps her.Back at her apartment after having another round of hot and heavy sex, Maggie talks about how she use to be a painter but since her diagnosis with Parkinson's, she has switched to photography/collages. Jamie talks about how he dropped out of med school because he has ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder).One night after networking at the bar, Jamie comes home and starts to mess around with Maggie when he starts to hyper ventilate and tells her that he loves her and that she is the first person he has ever told that to.A few days later, Bruce and Jamie are talking about an upcoming conference in Chicago and Jamie says he doesn't want to leave Maggie to go because of her illness. Jamie comes home to find Maggie drunk. Earlier in the day, she realized that she ran out of meds and couldn't get to the pharmacy in time to get a refill due to the wait in the clinic. They have a fight and Jamie leaves. After he walks out, Maggie starts to cry and throws her glass of water against a wall for she cannot stop her tremors in her left hand. Jamie comes back and holds her and they make up.Jamie asks Maggie to go the conference with him. She accepts and while at the conference she gets invited by a woman, who sees her hand tremors, to a Parkinson's convention across the street. She is moved by the people (mostly elderly and middle aged) and their stories about dealing with Parkinson's. Maggie texts Jamie to come over and join her. While at the refreshment table, Jamie meets and talks with a middle-aged man whose wife is in the final stages of the disease (stage 4). Jamie asks for advice and the man tells him to make a run for it. The man tells Jamie that he should not be in a relationship with a person with an incurable disease which will lead to a major heartache for both parties as well as his financial ruin over medical expenses as Maggie (whom still is in stage 1 of Parkinsion's) will get sicker and sicker with uncontrolable body twitches which will lead to her slow death. This shakes Jamie and, after the convention, Maggie tells him how much she loves him and how happy she is that she found out about the Parkinsons conference and that he is with her now that she no longer has any fear about what her Parkinson's will do. Jamie is beside himself, barely able to hide his insecurity.In a montage, we see Jamie researching all about Parkinson's Disease on the Internet and at various medical libraries and pushing Dr. Knight for info on specialists to help her find a cure or at least slow the progress of the disease. Over the next few weeks, Jamie starts taking Maggie to specialists and seminars across the country, paying for her to have tests done and maxing out his credit cards on hotel rooms and airfares. At one doctor's office in Boston, Jamie gets angry with a receptionist because their appointment was re-scheduled and they had flown in to see the doctor for only that one day. While he is yelling at the receptionist, Maggie walks out and Jamie runs after her. They fight and Maggie says that there is no cure for her Parkinson's and that she isn't having fun anymore. They break up against Jamie's wishes.Jamie is depressed over his breakup with Maggie, but Dr. Knight talks him into going to a pajama party at another doctor's house. Jamie and Josh show up and Josh hooks up with someone right away. Jamie takes Viagra and has a three-way with two female co-workers. Jamie wakes up later in pain and sees that he is having a bad reaction to the Viagra. As his brother drives him to the ER, Josh tells him that he doesn't envy Jamie's random empty sex life and that he misses his wife and he is going back to her.The next night, Jamie goes to meet Bruce for dinner at a restaurant and runs into Maggie who is on a date with some rebound guy. After some awkward conversation, Bruce shows up and says that Jamie has been promoted to the Chicago office. Maggie congratulates him and hurries off.During dinner, Bruce tells Jamie that he didn't get promoted and that he just received a raise. Jamie goes home and starts to pack to move to Chicago when he finds a video that he and Maggie had made of their talking in bed. He realizes that he wants to be with Maggie and goes to the dinner where she works. Her boss tells him that she has left for a med run to Canada and Jamie speeds off after her.Jamie chases the bus down on the highway and gets them to pull over at a rest stop. Maggie gets off and says that Jamie has three minutes to talk. He tells Maggie about how she makes him a better person, that he loves her and needs her. She starts to cry and says that she will need him more. He says that's okay and she says she can't ask that of him. He says ""you didn't"" and tells her that even if in some alternate reality there was a healthy version of both of them with no worries or problems that he would still choose their reality and problems. They hug and kiss and the movie cuts to yet another montage with a voice over from Jamie. It shows Maggie and Jamie living together and Jamie studying for med school.In the final shot, there is a image of a video of Jamie talking about living everyday to the fullest and how ""money isn't everything and you should follow your dreams""."
She's Out of My League,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815236/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An average Joe meets the perfect woman, but his lack of confidence and the influence of his friends and family begin to pick away at the relationship. Kirk is an average Joe who works as a TSA agent at the Pittsburgh airport with his friends. The status quo of his fairly monotonous life ends when he meets Molly, a smart, kind and gorgeous blonde. Because she's way out of his league (she's a hard 10 and he is but a 5), Kirk knows there's no way on earth she's ever going to fall for him. Or is there...?—Marco van Hoof <k_luifje7@hotmail.com> Kirk is a nice guy, who finishes last. He's an airport security guard in Pittsburgh, his ex-girlfriend hangs out at his parents' house with her new guy, he's out of shape and uncoordinated, and his car's a junker. At the airport, he finds the phone of a stunning, successful blonde, Mollie, and when he returns it, she offers dinner as thanks. She enjoys his company - he's unassuming and safe - and he's dazzled. His three friends warn him that she's out of his league and offer bad advice; he knows it will end soon and stumbles through a series of embarrassing moments. His ex has gotten jealous and invites him back: should he return to where he belongs? All roads lead to the airport.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Kirk Kettner (Jay Baruchel) is a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in his mid-20s who has low self-esteem and, by his own admission, has not accomplished very much in life. He works at the Pittsburgh International Airport as a Transportation Security Administration officer, and hopes of becoming a pilot one day. He tries to get back together with his self-centered ex-girlfriend, Marnie (Lindsay Sloane). Marnie ended her relationship with Kirk two years ago and is highly dismissive of his continued romantic interests after his latest pursuit. However, she has remained close with Kirk's parents (Debra Jo Rupp and Adam LeFevre) and overbearing brother Dylan (Kyle Bornheimer), continues to participate in family activities along with her new boyfriend Ron, and even lives with Kirk's parents. He has three close male friends who also work at the airport: Stainer (T. J. Miller), Devon (Nate Torrence), and Jack (Mike Vogel).Then at work one morning, a beautiful woman, Molly McCleish (Alice Eve), arrives at the passenger terminal for a flight to New York. While proceeding through security, her striking looks attract unwanted attention and harassment from several male employees. Kirk is the only employee to treat her courteously. She and Kirk exchange a few innocuous words, and she then proceeds to her flight, accidentally leaving her phone in the airport security area. Upon realizing she has misplaced it, Molly calls her phone and Kirk, back at the security checkpoint, answers. The two arrange for a time to meet the following evening so that he may return the phone to her.The following night, Kirk arrives at the Andy Warhol Museum where Molly, a professional event planner, is running a party. Devon accompanies Kirk to the Museum where Kirk returns Molly her phone. After returning the phone, both stayed and met Katie, Molly's sister. Katie then on purpose causes Kirk to spill his drink on the museum director and is asked to leave the museum for being uninvited for the party. Molly offers tickets to Kirk to the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey game at the Mellon Arena as an apology. Molly then subsequently gets herself invited to Kirk's family lunch. This incurs jealousy in Marnie, who feels upstaged by Molly's looks and takes a sudden interest in Kirk again. Stainer, ranking-obsessed, tells Kirk that on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 meaning the most attractive and successful, he's a 5, and Molly a 10, and that a relationship does not work if the difference is more than 2. Molly's friend and business partner Patty (Krysten Ritter) is also surprised: she phoned Molly while on a date with Kirk to allow her an opportunity to make up an excuse to leave, but that was not needed.In Molly's house, while the two are making out, Kirk ejaculates in his pants, just before her parents arrive. While avoiding to show that he had ejaculated, he avoids standing up and quickly leaves to avoid Molly and her parents noticing what happened. This cools down the relationship, but when Kirk later explains during an airshow what happened, things are fine again. Molly's former boyfriend Cam tells Kirk that Molly has a defect and to avoid saying that she is perfect.During a date, Kirk suggests to Molly to throw a birthday party for her sister, Katie. After the party, both of them go to Molly's place. Molly shows Kirk her webbed toes, which Kirk considers so minor that he decides that she is too perfect for him, and he breaks off the relationship. Kirk and Marnie resume their relationship and go on a family trip to Branson.Stainer and Patty realize their mistake in telling Kirk and Molly it wouldn't work out; the friends convince Kirk that he is ""a 10"" too. They pull Kirk off his plane as he tries to leave with his family and Marnie, while Patty brings Molly to the airport. Kirk rejects Marnie and reunites with Molly. Later, as a surprise, he takes Molly on a trip in a small plane, with himself being the pilot; he has taken flying lessons."

The Debt,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226753/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1965, three Mossad Agents cross into East Berlin to apprehend a notorious Nazi war criminal. Thirty years later, the secrets the Agents share come back to haunt them. The espionage thriller begins in 1997, as shocking news reaches retired Mossad secret agents Rachel Singer (Dame Helen Mirren) and Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson) about their former colleague David Peretz (Ciarán Hinds). All three have been venerated for decades by their country because of the mission that they undertook back in 1965, when the trio (Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, and Sam Worthington) tracked down Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen) in East Berlin. At great risk, and at considerable personal cost, the team's mission was accomplished--or was it? The suspense builds in and across two different time periods, with startling action and surprising revelations.—Focus Features In 1965, Mossad Agents Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain), Stephan Gold (Marton Csokas), and David Peretz (Sam Worthington) are assigned to kidnap Nazi Dieter Vogel, a.k.a. The Surgeon of Birkenau (Jesper Christensen), in East Berlin. They succeed in the abduction, but fail in bringing him to the west side. They stay with him in an apartment building; he escapes, but the trio of young Agents lies to their government and tells them that Rachel killed Vogel while he was running away. They have been honored in their country by their action for more than 30 years. In 1997, Rachel's daughter Sarah Gold (Romi Amboulafia) releases a book in Tel Aviv about the mission of her mother and the two other agents. Rachel Singer (Dame Helen Mirren), Sarah's father Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson), who is paralytic in a wheelchair, and David Peretz (Ciarán Hinds), who is missing, are retired and Rachel is uncomfortable with the lie with which they have been living. Out of the blue, David appears in Tel Aviv and commits suicide. Stephan investigates and finds that Dieter Vogel is apparently alive in a hospital in Kyiv, Ukraine, and will be interviewed by a journalist. Now Rachel must travel to Kyiv to conclude what they should have done 30 years ago.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Tel Aviv, Israel. 1966. The hangar doors of an airplane that has just landed open, revealing a woman and two men standing silently at the hatch. They are Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain), David Peretz (Sam Worthington), and Stephan Gold (Marton Csokas). ""Breathe,"" Stephan tells the others as they step off the plane. We notice that Rachel has a large bandage on her right cheek.A narration tells us that the three are Mossad agents who were sent to capture Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), the 'Surgeon of Birkeanu'; a Nazi war criminal. Stephan is the youngest unit commander in Israel military history and David had his 29th birthday during the course of the mission. Rachel was only 25 at the start.The film cuts to a ballroom scene where a woman is speaking. In part of her speech, she reveals that the three were unable to capture the target; he died trying to evade capture. An older woman listens in the audience with a noticeable scar on her cheek. Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren) speaks with her daughter, Sarah (Romi Aboulafia) who had written a book detailing her mother's mission. The book, and the three agents it is about, is being honored at the celebration. The crowd applauds and Sarah tells her mother that she is so proud to be her daughter.At an apartment complex, a man knocks on a room door. A man opens it and greets David Peretz (Ciarán Hinds), saying he's been expecting him. David walks with the man out to his car. On the street, he looks nearby to another car and sees a man beside it. It is Stephan (Tom Wilkinson). The man David is accompanying asks if everything is all right. David mutters that everything is fine but, without warning, runs into traffic and allows himself to be run over by a large truck as Stephan watches in horror.Back at the party, Rachel sits with her daughter in the ballroom. The audience wants Rachel to read an excerpt from the book. When a friend of Sarah's asks if Rachel helped write the book, Sarah says no and that her father was the one to help with the details. Her father, Stephan, arrives at the party and the audience applauds the two heroes as Rachel stands to read from the book.New Years Eve, 1965. Rachel is in an apartment in East Berlin listening to the fireworks outside. The apartment's walls leak so she places pots around to catch the water. Nearby there is a man chained to the wall. Rachel goes to the kitchen but, when she hears the water plopping in a pot strangely, she goes back into the room to find the man gone. Suddenly, he leaps out and attacks her, slashing her face with a piece of plate. They struggle and the man knocks her out before leaving the apartment. Rachel wakes up and drags herself on the ground, toppling a chair with a coat draped over it. In the coat is a pistol. She drags herself to the balcony as the man runs down the alley. She fires one shot, killing him. The man was Dieter Vogel.After the book party, Rachel and Stephan are in a car talking. They had apparently divorced years ago and are not on good terms. Stephan says he knows David went to see Rachel the day previously and wants to know what he said. Rachel says he had been traveling a lot but didn't say much else. Stephan presses the issue and Rachel says that he should speak to David himself if he really wants to know. Stephan lets his silence speak for itself and Rachel realizes that David is dead. They go to David's apartment and Rachel wonders why David would want to kill himself. She walks into a separate room and breaks down crying.The next day, Rachel and Stephan go to the beach to meet with Sarah's family. Stephan gives Rachel an envelope and a case and tells her to 'handle it'. Rachel waves goodbye to her daughter and leaves for the airport.West Berlin, 1965. Rachel crosses over to East Berlin and meets up with David. They are posing as husband and wife for the mission and rendezvous with Stephan at an apartment. Their mission is to locate The Surgeon, capture him, and smuggle him out of Germany so he can stand trial in Israel. Stephan and David share a room while Rachel bunks alone.Rachel, David, and Stephan spend their time training, taking turns sparring with each other and practicing disarming techniques. Rachel discusses her cover story, making sure she has it memorized to heart.Later that night, Stephan talks to David about women. He notes he's never seen David look at a woman, not even Rachel. Stephan asks if he should know something (hinting at the possibility of homosexuality). They see Rachel come out of the shower wearing only a towel and David stares. ""I guess you looked now,"" Stephan says.Back at David's apartment in the present day, Stephan shows Rachel an article. A man in a mental institution claims to be The Surgeon. Stephan says they need to handle it. He says he'd asked for David's help but he wouldn't give it. Rachel slaps Stephan and yells at him. He knew David had been ill for years. Rachel leaves the apartment.Back in East Berlin, 1965, Rachel and David go to a local ob-gyn clinic and wait for Rachel's appointment. She is pretending to have trouble conceiving with her husband to justify the visit. The doctor, Bernhardt, comes in and asks her about her family fertility history. When she reveals she is an only child, the doctor says that may be a potential sign of infertility. Rachel tells him that her mother died in WWII. ""My poor child,"" he says. Rachel takes pictures with a camera hidden in her necklace as he works to verify this is the man they are looking for.Stephan hands the necklace off to another agent on a bus.Stephan and David take a walk near an abandoned train station. It has been closed to the public and is guarded around the clock by armed guards. Their plan is to knock the doctor out and put him on one of the trains that passes through. There is a postal route that passes right by the tracks, so they will steal one of the vans to get close without anyone suspecting anything. Since trains are not allowed to stop there, they will have one of their agents on the train cause a distraction so they can slip on undetected. All they need is confirmation that Doctor Bernhardt is The Surgeon.David and Stephan steal a postal van for their plan.Stephan does another hand off with an agent on the bus. It is the confirmation they were hoping for. They are authorized to proceed.David reveals it is his 29th birthday. They go to the bar and celebrate. Rachel asks what he wants out of life. David tells them he wants to get this war criminal back to Israel so the world can see what he has done, so that everyone will know the truth. David is a man of honor and truth.The next night, David watches Rachel get out of the shower. She stands by a nearby heater to dry herself. David tells her she is brave. Rachel scoffs at the statement saying she is scared. ""But you do it anyway, because it is the right thing to do,"" David says. They stare at each other and lean in to kiss. David pulls away, realizing he is losing objectivity. Rachel is crushed.Later, she plays the piano and cries. David is in the kitchen going over paperwork, unable to concentrate. Stephan comes in and joins Rachel. He tells her she is so beautiful. Rachel lets herself be seduced by him and the next morning it is clear they slept together. Rachel and David go back to the ob-gyn holding hands, though they seemed strained.Rachel goes back to the doctor. The doctor notes she had sex and says that it is good that she is trying. Rachel then reveals that she knows who he 'really' is. Vogel has no time to react. Rachel uses her legs to put him in a headlock then stabs him with a concealed syringe to knock him out. Rachel screams for the nurse (Brigitte Kren), pretending that Vogel had a heart attack. The nurse calls for an ambulance. Stephan had previously hacked into the phone line so that, when the nurse makes the call, he and David drive off in an ambulance to beat the real paramedics. The nurse reveals on the call that Bernhardt/Vogel is her husband. Rachel is stunned by the implication.David and Stephan come in and wheel Vogel away, telling his wife she cannot ride along due to new regulations. Rachel leaves and is picked up down the block. They prepare to finish the mission.The trio set up at the post office, using the passing trains as cover to cut at the fence so they can slip through.Vogel is tied up in the van. He starts to move; the drugs are wearing off.Stephan and David are almost through the fence when they see an employee come out for a smoke. Rachel goes out and flirts with him to distract him. David and Stephan continue to cut through the fence.Vogel regains consciousness and honks the horn of the van just as the trio's train stops, claiming something is on the tracks as part of the ruse. Stephan knocks Vogel out but it is too late. The guards are spooked by the horn and go to investigate. Rachel tries to play it cool. Stephan says they need to get Vogel on the train but David will not leave without Rachel. The guards see the cut fence. All hell breaks loose. Rachel is forced to knock out the guard she was flirting with, catching the attention of the rest of them. The trio are forced to shoot back at the guards as they get into the van and drive off into the night.Stephan panics, since they missed the drop at the train and says they have failed the mission and their country. David is calmer and says that, since they still have Vogel, the mission is not over. They just need a new plan to get him out.Back at the apartment they determine the terms of the plan. They will keep Vogel locked up and will take shifts guarding and feeding him. Since Rachel has been seen, she is forbidden to leave the apartment.Vogel speaks to Rachel, asking if his wife is okay. Rachel doesn't respond but eventually gives him a nod. Stephan warns her not to speak to him because he can get into their heads.Over the next few days they take turns watching him. Vogel is defiant, routinely spitting up food and trying to fight David and Stephan. However, he is calmer with Rachel. One day he tells her he knows she wasn't lying about her mother dying in war. He tells her he is sorry for her pain. Rachel is unnerved by this.David comes back in as Rachel leaves the room where Vogel is. Rachel asks him why he didn't leave when he had the chance. David looks at her and kisses her. He says he stayed for her. Rachel is stunned, then kisses him back. They are interrupted by Stephan. Stephan tells them the Americans have agreed to help. They just need to wait it out a few more days.A few more days pass and Rachel is getting more stricken with cabin fever. Stephan comes in and says the Americans have changed their minds and decided not to help because apparently an East German border guard had been killed during their getaway. Rachel goes for the door, needing air, but is not allowed to leave. She falls to the floor and cries.The three attempt to plan their next move. Stephan says they should just kill Vogel. David retorts that they are not monsters and Vogel must stand trial. There is a knock at the door. They think Stephan was followed. Rachel answers and Stephan stays with a gun to Vogel, saying if it is one of his friends, he will die first. Rachel comes back in. It was just their neighbor, inviting them to a New Year's party.David is feeding Vogel. Vogel taunts him about Rachel being with Stephan, saying it does not fit. She should be with David since he would want a family. Vogel then drops a bombshell; he knows Rachel is one month pregnant and Stephan is the father. David tries to hold in his rage. Vogel goes on about how Jews are inherently selfish and how four armed men in death camps could lead thousands to die because not one would sacrifice themselves for others. Vogel says he realized, in that moment, that their kind did not deserve to live. David, overcome with rage, smashes a plate over Vogel's face and starts punching him. Stephan finds him and pulls him away.Vogel was able to grab a plate shard and starts cutting at the ropes that hold him. Rachel cleans him and the mess, unaware of this.We now return to the scene where Rachel reads from her daughter's book. The ending plays out in almost the same way: Vogel escapes from his binds, slashes her face, and knocks her out. There is only one problem with the true ending of the story. Rachel never killed Vogel, he got away.In the past, just after Vogel escapes, David and Stephan return to the apartment and find out what happened. Stephan is freaked at the implication of losing a war criminal like this and how they will be punished. David and Rachel agree to take blame. Suddenly, Stephan gets an idea. They will lie. They will say Vogel tried to escape and they killed him. Stephan reasons that they need to save face for Israel. Besides, Vogel should never resurface and will spend the rest of his life hiding in fear of being killed. David agrees to lie. Rachel is shocked that he would give in to his moral code but eventually gives in as well. They hide the truth for thirty years and are celebrated for the heroics they never performed.Rachel and Stephan talk with each other on the beach, 1997. Stephan tells her that Vogel has been located at a hospital. He doesn't know where, but a reporter in the Ukraine does. Rachel will need to find out the location. Stephan looks at her. ""If I could go back, I would change it all."" Looking at their daughter he adds, ""Everything but one.""Israel, 1970. Stephan and Rachel are having a dinner party. David is there. Rachel tells him Stephan has a lot of 'girlfriends' and he uses them to punish her. When David asks why, Rachel says for several reasons. Because she got pregnant. Because she doesn't love Stephan. ""Because of you,"" she tells David.David tells her that he is leaving the country tonight. Rachel is shocked but David reveals that he can't keep up the cover story anymore. He pleads for her to come with him. Rachel says she can't (probably afraid to leave her daughter) but David presses for her to do so (he would take care of both of them). Rachel says no and is momentarily distracted by Stephan. David leaves, dejected. That is the last time she will see him for almost thirty years.Back in the present, Rachel has reached the Ukraine and the newspaper office. She pretends to post a classified ad and notes the security code, having placed invisible ink on the ad's envelope. After the place closes, she picks the lock and disarms the alarm. She goes to the reporter's desk and finds the information she is looking for. She is shocked when she sees that the folder contains a recent picture of her. Suddenly, a couple of drunken reporters come in and she has to hide and listen to them have sex until they leave.Back to the day before David kills himself, David attends one of Rachel's speeches and meets up with her. He asks if she has been with anyone since Stephan. Rachel responds there was someone else, but 'he left', hinting at David himself. David tells her he's been traveling for the past 25 years looking for Vogel. Rachel is shocked and asks what he would have done had he found him. David says he would have brought him to trial and told the truth, thinking that she would have done the same. Rachel denies this, saying her daughter would be crushed, not just professionally, but personally if the truth ever came out. David goes to leave but asks that, if they could go back and he had waited for her, would she have gone with him? ""We can't go back,"" Rachel says and leaves.In Ukraine, Rachel goes to the hospital and waits in reception. The reporter in question comes and she overhears the room number where Vogel is apparently held. She goes to the room, number 414, but stops in the bathroom first, opening the case Stephan gave her. Inside is a syringe filled with poison. She goes into Vogel's room to administer the poison through his IV, but doesn't. He starts to speak to her, thinking she is the reporter, and Rachel senses something is off. She sits down and starts writing a note on a piece of paper.Rachel calls Stephan and says the man they found is not Vogel. The old man had been fed the stories and is so senile he is just repeating them. Stephan is relieved that they didn't have to kill anyone. Rachel tells him that David committed suicide, not because the truth was going to be revealed, but because he didn't want to lie anymore. In addition, he looked to her for the approval to tell the truth and she denied him. Being denied that by the woman he loved broke him. He couldn't take it anymore. Rachel just wants her daughter to be proud of her for something she actually did. Rachel decides to tell the truth. Stephan tells her not to but she hangs up the phone. Stephan stares off, realizing the powder keg is about to explode.Rachel is about to leave when she sees a man on the staircase staring at her. She looks back to see him gone. She has been recognized. She gives chase and finds the man in the bathroom. It is Vogel. He has been feeding his stories of the crimes he committed to a senile man in the ultimate ploy to get out of punishment. He pretends to be incoherent to get close to Rachel, only to stab her with a pair of scissors. They struggle, and she stabs him with a piece of broken mirror. Vogel stabs her again and leaves her in the bathroom to die.Vogel takes a few steps then falls to the ground dead. In the struggle, Rachel managed to stab him with the poison syringe. She is badly wounded, but is able to pick herself up, hold a towel to her wound, and limps out into the hall, her mission fulfilled at last.The reporter goes into the fake Vogel's room to finish his story when he sees the note that Rachel had left. It tells him who she is and the truth of what happened in 1966; the truth that had been hidden for so long, finally ready to be told."
Charlie St. Cloud,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1438254/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After Charlie survives a car crash that kills his younger brother, he is given the gift of seeing the spirits of his brother and others who he has lost, and must use his powers to save the woman he loves from impending disaster. Fatherless golden high school boy Charlie St. Cloud had a golden future, handsome, popular and admitted to Stanford on a scholarship, even recruited for a prestigious yacht sailing team. But shortly after graduating, Charlie feels existentially guilty about the death of his doting, beloved kid brother Sam whom he was driving to a playmate when a crashing car killed the junior. Charlie pledges to continue the baseball practice he promised to continue until entering Stanford, which he now ditches fro a menial job as graveyard keeper, while their mother shamelessly moved out of state, and tends to the grave of his Vietnam-killed former school buddy Sully, the second ghost who binds his sole to their beach home town. He's finally tempted to start living his own life again when he meets a female sailor his age about to embark on a transatlantic voyage and spends a ho night, but still can't 'leave Sam'. Only when he hears the authorities give up searching for her, having gone missing at sea during a storm, he misses a 'practice' at the beach when the morning canon is fired to sail hoping to save her life.—KGF Vissers After surviving the terrible car accident that claimed the life of his beloved eleven-year-old brother, Sam, the avid young sailor and promising athlete, Charlie St. Cloud, retreated from life, immediately following a sailing scholarship to Stanford University. Now, to cope with grief, Charlie is bent on keeping his promise to Sam to play catch every sunset in a small clearing in the woods near the cemetery. As a result, racked with guilt, Charlie has given up sailing, starts working, and pivots his life around those daily sunset practices. How much longer will Charlie put his life on hold to find redemption?—Nick Riganas I just watched the movie, then read the following synopsis. It is very different from the movie, so I am assuming it is a synopsis of the book, which preceded the movie and which I didn't read. Charlie is about 18 in the movie (he graduates high school and is planning to start college in the fall) and Sam is 11, before the movie advances 5 years. The details of the car crash below are very different. Charlie agrees to drop Sam off at a friend's house on his way to a party, the last before his friend leaves for boot camp. Charlie is stopped with the wheels turned left, waiting for a lull in the traffic so he can turn left, when a car rear-ends him, sending him into the left lane, where an 18-wheeler then crashes into the passenger side of the car. Charlie becomes the caretaker of the cemetery - not an undertaker. When Tess is ""in between,"" she notices that she can't see her reflection in a window (not the water.) When Charlie doesn't make it back to the cemetery by sunset, because he is looking for Tess and her boat, Sam goes into the light. After Tess's boat flips over, she is not hanging upside down. Charlie finds her lying on nearby rocks. Tess recovers from the boat accident and goes home, before Charlie is let out of the hospital. Charlie doesn't become a paramedic. Charlie goes to the woods by the cemetery to say goodbye to Sam before he and Tess sail around the world. He can no longer see Sam. It's not clear if he can hear him or not. Sam is not upset that Charlie didn't make it back that other night. He says it was time, that crossing over is better than he could have imagined.Charlie St. Cloud (age 15) and Sam (12) are two brothers with a love so strong, no force can separate them. When their mom leaves Charlie to babysit Sam, they decide to go to watch a 1991 Red Sox baseball game in Boston against the New York Yankees with their pet beagle, Oscar. They ""borrow"" their neighbor Mrs. Pung's Ford Country Squire. On the way there they cannot decide which CD to listen to. As they cross the General Edwards bridge on the Saugus River, on the way home, Charlie decides to take a look at the moon to see if Sam was right about the moon being larger that night. Charlie does not see an 18-wheeler truck come and they end up tumbling twice crushing Sam along the way. When they are dead, they find themselves close to the cemetery in Marblehead, the town where they live. Sam is scared and Charlie makes a promise that they will never abandon each other. However, Charlie gets resuscitated in an ambulance by a religious paramedic, Florio Ferrente and carries on living.
Five years later, Charlie has grown up and is working at the Marblehead cemetery. Every evening at dusk he goes to a nearby forest where he plays with Sam. Charlie has the gift of seeing ghosts. This serves him well as an undertaker, as he can talk with ghosts.
In the town lives Tess Carroll, a yachtswoman who wants to make a round the world trip. A week prior to her departure, she directs her yacht in to a storm to test it, not listening to her shipsman Tink Weatherbee, who told her not to go into the storm. The storm sucks Tess into its grasp and the ship flips, leaving Tess hanging on upside down. Tess appears at the cemetery where her dad is buried. While regarding her father's memorial, she hears a loud clanging noise, which is Charlie scaring away the geese with his methods of banging trash can covers togeher. She remembers Charlie from high school and wonders if he remembers her. They both talk and Charlie ends up asking Tess to come over for dinner that night. Both are not entirely sure of this arrangement for different reasons. Tess is concerned with the fact that she never really was a true believer in love, and Charlie is worried that this could come in between his promise to him and Sam. The next day while taking a walk with her dog, Bobo, Tess realizes that people ignore her when Bobo comes off his leash and nobody hears her saying to stop him. She then looks into the water and realizes that her reflection is not there. What is more, she can see Sam St. Cloud, the boy who died 13 years ago.
While at lunch the next day after their date, an officer comes in and states that Tess's boat, the Querencia, has gone missing and parts of the ship have been found. Charlie is shocked at the thought that Tess could be dead. He had heard of ""middle ground"" where spirits would stay until they were ready to pass over to the next level. He had seen many come and go quickly and others who liked to stay like his brother. In the meantime everyone in the town in possession of a boat, including Charlie, explores the harbor in order to look for Tess's body. Charlie questions his sanity because the night they shared together was so real and Tess was full of life. There was no way she could possibly be gone.
Everyone gives up the search, but then Charlie feels that there is one place he has to go. With Sam's help he finds Tess's body. Tess is transported to a hospital where the doctors stabilize her in a deep coma.
A few months later, Charlie decides to quit his job and move on, bidding a final farewell to Sam, now 25 years old from crossing over. He is now a paramedic at Engine 2 on Franklin Street. During his last visit at the hospital Tess wakes up. Charlie remembers how they met, and Charlie tells her the story of how they met and fell in love at Marblehead Cemetery."

How Do You Know,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1341188/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After being cut from the U.S.A. softball team and feeling a bit past her prime, Lisa finds herself evaluating her life and in the middle of a love triangle, as a corporate guy in crisis competes with her current, baseball-playing beau. Star softball player, Lisa, has just been cut from the national team; Scholarly business man, George, has just been indicted from his father's company. With everything that they know in their lives taken from them, Lisa and George attempt to find romance. Lisa's potential boyfriend, Matty, however, is as clueless and perpetually single as they come, and George's girlfriend just dumped him. A chance hook-up through mutual friends, Lisa and George may be able to form a friendship, or more, that can help them climb out of the piles of lemons that life has handed to them.—napierslogs Lisa Jorgenson and George Madison simultaneously face major life altering events. Thirty-one year old Lisa, long the emotional center of the national Softball USA women's team, is cut as she was hitting the twilight of her playing life without she even realizing it. As such, she made no plans, like many of her teammates, for her post-softball life, she, not knowing what to do, mimicking the path of the other players without any thought if it's what she really wants. As a team member, she attended therapy because it was offered as a team perk, and although stating that she didn't believe in it, she has ended up over-analyzing everything arguably because of what she learned in therapy. George, a high powered executive in his father Charles Madison's company, is a straight up kind of guy who would not knowingly do something wrong. It is in his misassumption that others, including his colleagues, also do the right thing that he learns he is being investigated for securities fraud, his only wrongdoing being trusting his colleagues. Due to the legalities, the Board of the company recommends not only not having contact with George, but not providing him with information concerning their internal machinations in dealing with the investigation and not providing him any in-house legal counsel, with only his father and his loyal secretary, Annie, standing by him, albeit necessarily from a distance. It is because of George's problems and her own self-interest that George's girlfriend breaks-up with him, the break-up just after they decided to take their relationship to the next level. It is under these circumstances, arguably the worst day in their respective lives, that Lisa and George meet on a delayed and what turns out to be a disastrous blind date. However, in his emotional agony over his legal problems, George sees something special in Lisa. The next time George and Lisa meet in unexpectedly running into each other, Lisa has ended up entering into a relationship with Washington Nationals pitcher Matty Reynolds. While Matty is outwardly caring, he also is insensitive and immature, probably the result of living in the bubble of his life of wealth and fan adulation. Lisa is able to justify one insensitive comment or action by Matty after another in her analyzing the situation after the fact. George tries to remain a part of Lisa's life in he slowly falling for her, she the only bright spot in his life, while Lisa enjoys George's company especially as a respite from problems with Matty. What George ends up doing with regard to Lisa is in light of his legal problems and figuring out where those legal problems were initiated.—Huggo"

Machete,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985694/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After being set-up and betrayed by the man who hired him to assassinate a Texas Senator, an ex-Federale launches a brutal rampage of revenge against his former boss. The highly skilled Federale Machete is hired by some unsavory types to assassinate a senator. But just as he's about to take the shot, he notices someone aiming at him and realizes he's been set up. He barely survives the sniper's bullet, and is soon out for revenge on his former employers, with the reluctant assistance of his brother Cheech Marin, who has become a priest and taken a vow of nonviolence. If you hire him to take out the bad guys, make sure the bad guys aren't you!—rmlohner Despite of warnings from his Chief, Officer Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) attempts to rescue a witness against gangster Torrez (Steven Seagal), resulting in the slaying of his family, and his house being burnt down. Three years later, having fully recuperated from his physical injuries, he makes a living as a casual laborer, and is hired to assassinate right-winged Senator John McLaughlin for $150K. His attempt results in the Senator getting injured, and he soon realizes that he has been set-up to ensure a sympathy vote for McLaughlin - who, while ostensibly determined to built an electrified border-fence, has close connections with Torrez; and is also involved with gun-toting vigilante groups that gun down Mexicans with impunity. Machete will also find himself on the run from the Police; pressure will be brought upon the underground 'Network' that assists Mexicans; his brother (Cheech Marin) will be tortured; while ignorant/unknowing Americans get ready to elect McLaughlin.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) In Mexico, the determined federal agent Machete Cortez opposes to the order of his chief and drives with his partner to the hideout of the drug lord Rogelio Torrez to rescue an abducted witness against the gangster. However, he finds the witness naked on the bed but he is surprisingly betrayed by the woman, and his wife and daughter are murdered by Torrez. Three years later, Machete is an illegal immigrant in Texas that wanders on the streets seeking job in the Day Labor Site. He is hired by Michael Booth to assassinate the boasting right-winged Senator John McLaughlin, who is against the immigrants and defends the construction of an electrified fence along the border with Mexico. Machete receives one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the assignment, but he gives the money to Luz, a Mexican woman that sells taco in her truck and manages the underground Network that assists illegal Mexicans and helped Machete three years ago. When Machete is ready as a sniper in a tower, he finds that he has been betrayed and set up by Booth, who actually is McLaughlin's adviser and plotted the scheme to improve the statistics with the sympathy of the electors to McLaughlin. Once again Machete survives and discovers that Booth supports the vigilantes led by the cruel Von Jackson and is associated to Torrez. Now Machete seeks revenge against his enemies and becomes a myth.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Set up and left for dead after that fateful encounter with the deadly drug lord, Torrez, the widowed former Mexican Federale, Machete, is now struggling to eke out an existence as a day labourer in Texas. It's been three long years since the brutal murder of his family, and someone coerces the tight-lipped Machete into assassinating the corrupt anti-immigration politician, Senator McLaughlin. Of course, a set-up awaits Machete, who, once more, finds himself on the run, against the backdrop of a sinister conspiracy. But, this time, the wronged Mexican is not alone, and his thirsty knives are razor-sharp. Who can survive the blow of Machete's cold-steel blade?—Nick Riganas Machete opens along a road through Mexican mesa. A car rides down the road, occupied by two Federales-- Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) and his partner (Vic Trevino). They are en route to rescue a young woman (Mayra Leal) held captive by a ruthless drug lord named Torrez (Steven Seagal), who was once Machete's partner in the Federales. Machete's current partner is furious at the rescue mission, saying that the girl is probably locked up somewhere, heavily drugged, and is just another of many dozens of kidnap victims; they do not need to go and rescue her. Machete calmly asks his partner, 'if not us, then who?'Machete's cell phone rings. His direct superior, the Mexican Federal chief (Alejandro Antonio), angrily orders that they stop and wait for backup to arrive. They are not to disobey orders and storm the place where the girl is believed to be held, alone. Machete takes the phone and crushes it in his hand.Roaring into a small villa, the car stops at a three-story house with barred windows. Three men step out of the house, heavily armed. Machete throws the car into reverse and backs up a number of yards. His partner bravely tells Machete that he is with him, calling him 'boss.' Machete holds up a large, wickedly sharp machete (from which he gets his name) and says in English, 'this is the boss.'Machete then propels his car forward, racing straight toward the house and the men in front of it. They open fire as the car roars toward them, Machete's partner firing back through the windshield. The partner is hit by a hail of gunfire shortly before the car plows through their line. They leap away as the car crashes through the front of the house. Machete apologizes to his partner, who lays dead beside him.Charging into the house, Machete promptly foils an ambush, slicing off the hand of an assailant pointing a gun at him. Catching the gun, with the severed hand still holding it, Machete wades into battle, slaughtering all of the men in the house with both the gun and his machete. He smashes into the room where the kidnap victim lays naked on the bed. She sits up as he enters, balking at his order to get dressed. He scoops her over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes and starts carrying her out, the girl seeming to enjoy it.More of Torrez's men enter the house. Machete puts the girl down and she starts feeling his muscles. Touching his machete, she asks if it's sharp. Told that it is, she pulls it from his belt and stabs Machete through the thigh, incapacitating him. She kicks him in the face and pulls out a small mobile device hidden within her private parts, saying, 'I got him.'To Machete's horror, the Federal chief walks in, telling him he should have stood down like he was ordered. Machete's superior is working for Torrez. Torrez himself walks in, accompanied by his henchwoman/slave girl (Cheryl Chin), who rewards the naked chica for her work in capturing Machete... with a bullet through her head. Torrez is disappointed that Machete is the only one of the Federales who doesn't take bribe money to look the other way on Torrez's activities. Everyone in the DEA and the Marshals is doing so. Finally Torrez says he should ask Machete's wife. Machete is horrified as his wife (Nina Leon) is brought in and slaughtered right in front of him. Torrez then coldly says that Machete's daughter has already suffered the same fate as her mother. Aiming his katana at Machete's neck, Torrez says beheading him would give him an honorable death. But an honorable death is exactly what Torrez doesn't want to offer Machete. He has his men kick Machete down and set the house on fire, leaving him to burn.The opening credits play.A small day labor site in Texas, three years later. Mexican day laborers gather here, hiring out performing menial tasks that will earn them and their loved ones a living. A radio program is heard playing; the host is interviewing Franklin Jonas, deputy director of the local Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. Jonas is discussing the ongoing effort to enforce US border security against illegal immigration. Jonas says that battling the stem of illegal immigration is difficult because of the long border between Texas and Mexico. He says they need to dismantle a large, elaborate support network that helps immigrants cross the border and settle in America, finding them jobs, resulting in American citizens remaining unemployed and poor. Jonas says ICE's best agents are investigating the network in an effort to dismantle it.One such agent is busy at work as she listens to the radio program... Agent Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba). She is doing surveillance and taking photos at a small taco/coffee stand run by a pretty young woman named Luz (Michelle Rodriguez). Sartana suspects Luz as the Network's kingpin, code-named 'Shé.'As an elderly Texan hires some day laborers, having them load up his pickup truck, Sartana pauses at the sight of a face she finds interesting... a tall, muscular, Mexican man with scars and tattoos. It is Machete. Taking photographs, Sartana speaks into her personal recorder, saying that she knows he is new in the labor site, and requests that Machete's photo be run for possible criminal background. She watches Luz call Machete over. A day laborer knocks on Sartana's window, asking if she needs a gardener. She shows him her badge and he hurries off.Nighttime along the US/Mexico border. A van drives a group of immigrants to a spot just shy of the border, ordering them out to go the rest of the way on foot. A young man begs for assistance for his wife, who is both heavily pregnant and ill, but he only gets a gun pointed at his face by the unsympathetic driver. The immigrants all startt to rush through the border.A jeep rushes to intercept the immigrants, its driver and passengers whooping and calling 'roundup time.' They coldly slaughter several of the immigrants as the others rush back further into Mexico. Out of the van steps Von Jackson (Don Johnson), a wealthy Texan landowner who despises illegal immigrants. The husband of the pregnant woman is wounded, and she cannot run in her current state. The terrified woman watches as Von approaches her. She doesn't speak English and he doesn't speak Spanish-- he by choice. A cameraman in the jeep takes footage as Von tells the woman and her husband that they are trespassing on land belonging to Von's father. Von then pulls his gun and shoots the woman in the stomach, mortally wounding her and her unborn child. The more squeamish of his henchmen cannot stand the sight, but Von is unsympathetic, warning that if the woman delivered her baby on American soil, it would be entitled to American citizenship and all its benefits. He tells his men that many people consider them vigilantes, but he sees it as vigilance. He then asks, 'Who's gonna stop 'em, Senator?'The man Von addressed as 'Senator' (Robert De Niro) says, 'I am' and guns down the woman's husband with a rifle, coldly saying, 'Welcome to America.' He then makes sure that video footage was captured, for the benefit of his wealthier supporters.A television commercial then shows that this Senator is John McLaughlin, who is running for re-election in the Texas state senate. McLaughlin despises illegal immigration and is looking to make sure it is fought fiercely. The commercial ruthlessly compares immigrants to parasites who bleed America dry from the inside out, and shows that McLaughlin supports building an electrified border fence, and harsh, jack-booted border patrollers/enforcers. The propaganda in the commercial goes so far as to show pictures of large numbers of maggots and cockroaches whenever the narrator in the commercial speaks of, 'the invaders.'Day time. An illegal back-alley bareknuckle fight is taking place. Bets are being placed as one fighter defeats the other. The victorious fighter points at a passerby he sees, whom he considers a worthy opponent. The fight promoter calls out to the man-- it is Machete. Machete balks at being invited to fight, looking at the taco and coffee in his hands. The promoter baits him by offering him $500 for five minutes in the alley.Machete walks into the circle and puts down his coffee, but keeps his taco in his hand. He dodges the punches thrown by the fighter, making him look clumsy. Machete is even able to continue eating his taco as he evades all the adversary's attacks, not even bothering to throw any counterpunches. Finally the fighter misses another punch, but hits his hand on a solid metal beam, breaking his hand. Machete wins the fight by default and is paid the money as he recovers his coffee.A black luxury car with tinted windows has stopped near the alley; its driver (Jeff Fahey) watching the fight intently.machete goes to Luz's taco stand and pays her $5 for the taco and coffee she'd given him earlier. Luz looks over Machete's shoulder and sees Sartana approaching. All the day laborers, knowing Sartana well, scatter at her approach. Sartana goes to the stand to buy two bean and cheese tacos and a coffee. Luz is sarcastic and unpleasant in her reception of Sartana; the two women know each other and don't like each other one bit. Sartana occasionally wants to see Luz's credentials to ensure she is still authorized to live and work near the labor site, and Luz, thinking turnabout is fair play, likes to ask to see Sartana's badge in return. As they 'civilly' argue over the morality of Sartana enforcing immigration, sending unauthorized laborers back to squalor and poverty in Mexico (Sartana herself is Mexican, so Luz and many of the laborers see her acts as treason toward her own people), Sartana drops a few not-so-subtle hints showing she suspects Luz of aiding illegal immigrants. Luz finally gives Sartana the tacos she requested, more to get rid of her than anything else.A news bulletin reports on a sharp decline in support for McLaughlin; his hard-line stance on immigration is wearing thin on several of his support groups.Machete is arriving back at the labor site when the luxury car pulls up and the driver, whose name is Michael Booth, tells him to get in. Machete starts to tell Booth about the labor services he does and his rates for them, when Booth suddenly asks him if he's killed anyone before. He brings Machete into a well-appointed office and pours him a drink. He slides a folder across the desk to Machete containing a photo of McLaughlin. He quickly describes McLaughlin's hard-nosed policy on illegal immigrants and their labor, before giving Machete his pitch: Booth says that the state runs on the services provided by these immigrants, as their rates are cheap enough to keep the state's expenditures at a minimum, which it desperately needs. So, Booth says, since immigrants are being deported in alarmingly increasing numbers, it's to both his and Machete's benefit if the senator is rubbed out.Booth produces a briefcase filled with used bills, $150,000 worth of money, which he says he will pay Machete for the job. Machete downs his drink and tells him to get someone else. Booth says that there's no time left to find another person; the job has to happen tomorrow. He admits that he cannot force Machete to do the assassination, but he can make sure Machete suffers an unfortunate accident if he refuses. Once the job is done, he gets the money and can disappear and do a lot of good with the cash. Booth takes Machete to a room filled with a lot of high-tech, sophisiticated firepower and hands him a state-of-the-art assault rifle, along with a cell phone in case there are any problems; saying Machete needs to be on the roof at 1 pm sharp, and fire the shot by 1:04 pm. As he leaves, true to his nature, Machete sees a machete on the table and takes it with him as well.As Machete leaves, Booth gets a call on his cell phone, showing it is from ""April."" Quickly he drives to a crackhouse and kills everyone there, pulling out a blonde girl (Lindsay Lohan)-- his daughter, April. He berates her on not coming to him to get her needs met, and she groggily gives a tossed-off, 'sorry, Daddy' as he drives her away.Machete sits on a bench at the labor site, looking at pictures of his family during happier times. He goes to Luz's taco stand and gives her the money he was paid-- the whole briefcase full, telling her to use it well. Machete knows that Luz is involved in the support Network-- they helped him get across the border once.Senator McLaughlin is making a public appearance-- this is the site that he is supposed to be killed at. Machete gets on to the proper rooftop at the appointed time. McLaughlin's speech is beautifully-crafted propaganda designed to work his listeners into a frenzy. He compares immigrants to terrorists who take jobs from honest, hard-working American citizens that bust their backsides to feed their families. His propaganda speech does exactly what it's intended to do-- stir the passions of his listeners to tempestuous levels.Machete is lining his shot up on McLaughlin, centering the scope on his rifle, when he happens to glance a little to one side. Using the scope for a better view, he realizes there is a second sniper concealed on another rooftop... Booth's aide (Shea Whigham); and he is aiming another high-powered rifle... at Machete.The sniper's bullet wounds Machete in the shoulder. He then quickly turns and shoots Senator McLaughlin in the leg. Booth calls out and points to the rooftop where Machete was perched, and everyone turns and sees Machete on his rooftop, trying to get away. Cameras catch footage of him running away with the rifle in his hands. Quickly Machete sees the whole job was a set-up. He has been framed for the assassination attempt on Senator McLaughlin. Machete must fight and shoot his way past a security guard and a number of Booth's henchman to make good his escape. But as he descends a fire escape and hurries down an alley, he is clubbed from behind and knocked down, and two lawmen are pointing combat shotguns right at him at point-blank range.They take Machete into the squad car and drive off with him, where they reveal that they are also Booth's accomplices, laughing over it because they think Machete doesn't speak English. The driver of the squad car says Machete must believe they are real cops because they frisked him, cuffed him and put him in the car just like real cops do. But suddenly the 'partner' says he didn't frisk Machete.Machete's machete erupts through the chest of the squad car driver, the blade having been driven clean through the backrest of the seat, and the driver's back. Machete twists the blade to force the driver's hands to turn the steering wheel in such a way that the car crashes. Machete kicks out the rear windshield and gets clear just as the fake squad car explodes, killing both henchmen.News stations are reporting on the assassination attempt and that the would-be killer was of Mexican descent. Booth goes to his office and sets up a laptop wireless conference call-- to Torrez. He uses the conference call to show him the news footage of the assassination attempt, saying that McLaughlin's re-election is now a shoe-in-- Torrez is shown to have an interest in the re-election. As he watches the news coverage, Torrez notices that the hired assassin looks familiar. He backtracks and zooms in, recognizing Machete, but saying nothing about it to Booth, who writes Machete off as a day laborer off the streets who won't be missed. But Torrez warns Booth that he had better be able to provide positive proof that the hired assassin is dead.As the conference call ends, Booth gets a phone call from the sniper saying it's done-- he 'thinks' Machete is toast. Booth sternly orders the sniper to triple-check every hospital and morgue in the city to verify positively that Machete is dead.Machete is being taken to a hospital that specializes in discreetly treating illegal immigrants. Two pretty young nurses rush him to an ER while carefully telling him that nobody knows he's here, and he was brought in as a John Doe. Machete is taken to Doc Felix (Felix Sabates), who is impressed that the bullet rebounded off of Machete's shoulder and would have lodged in his head and killed him, but it was stopped by another bullet that had already lodged there from long ago. As Machete awakens, Doc Felix tells him in Spanish that everyone in the hospital is part of the Network.The sniper arrives with henchman, carrying flowers. He tells the reception nurse he's there to visit someone who'd been brought to ICU. Suspecting trouble, the reception nurse gives directions, but the sniper quickly figures out she's lying, and the directions she gave lead to a back exit from the hospital. He starts to head in the correct direction, and the reception nurse quietly alerts Doc Felix.Machete springs into action, collecting a number of surgical instruments used for scraping bones clean. He pulls the belt off one nurse's uniform and asks Felix to pass him an air tank.The sniper is on one side of a double doorway, and through its windows he sees a stretcher approaching the doors. Quickly he drops the flowers, revealing a gun hidden among them, and fires several shots. The stretcher pushes through the doors, showing it was propelled by the air tank, which was strapped down to the stretcher, under the sheets, by the nurse's belt.As the sniper and his henchmen see the ruse, they all turn toward the door... but Machete was hiding under the stretcher, hidden by the sheet. Using the surgical instruments, he kills a number of the sniper's henchman, ripping a hole open in one's midsection and grabbing his intestine, using it as a rope to go through the window and rappel down (Felix had conversationally mentioned to the nurses that the human intestines are sixty feet long).Sartana is playing a combat video game that uses movements from her whole body as controls. As she finishes up, her boss, Jonas, calls her and tells her that McLaughlin was shot by an illegal immigrant. Sartana rushes to her TV and watches footage, amazed as she recognizes Machete. Jonas orders her to bring him in.Machete is staggering down a street when he is found by Luz, en route back home with her taco-stand truck. She tells him that he's all over the TV and ushers him inside her truck, driving him to her house.TV news updates show that the assassination attempt on Senator McLaughlin has pushed his ratings to a commanding lead in the re-election race. That he was shot by an illegal immigrant is convincing people that harshly strict border security is now necessary.Luz brings Machete into her bedroom and lays him down on her bed, breaking open an egg underneath the bed so its vapors will help Machete heal. Machete sees various newspaper clippings on Luz's bedroom wall showing her dressed and armed as a revolutionary soldier-- strongly hinting that she is the legendary 'Shé' who leads the support Network. Luz sadly tells Machete that while she is the Network's leader, the figurehead of 'Shé' is an imaginary personage she created to give the people she helps, a sense of hope and purpose. If she really was this figurehead, Luz wouldn't be operating a taco truck. Luz originally just tried to provide food for immigrants and try to discreetly get them jobs, but now Von and his border vigilantes are hunting her and her people like dogs. Machete tells Luz that she is a fighter and can stop the injustice.Luz reveals that she knows who Machete is-- she's heard about the legends. He suggests that maybe the legend is better. Saying she'll be the judge of that, Luz gets into the bed and sleeps with Machete.Sartana is on Machete's trail, searching for him. Her computer, tapping into identification databases, finally identifies a photo of him and Sartana is astonished as she reads the file on Machete, his background as an ex-Federale, his impressive credentials.Booth is at his palatial home breakfasting with April, and his wife June (Alicia Rachel Marek)-- on tacos, of all things. Despite being involved in drug-dealing, Booth is trying to get April in college to go on to a decent career; but April reveals she models herself-- pornographically-- on the web, and her site receives a tremendous amount of internet traffic. Booth's cell phone rings; the sniper is reporting in about Machete's escape. Booth furiously orders the sniper to go to the corner where Booth picked Machete up, and find him.The sniper corners a day laborer and questions him on Luz's whereabouts. The laborer says he hasn't seen Luz yet-- 'she's late.' The sniper realizes that the laborer didn't mean 'she,' but 'Shé...' and the laborer knows where 'Shé' lives.The sniper is arriving with more henchmen at Luz's house. Machete awakens, alone, finding Luz gone, and that the Texas heat has cooked the egg under the bed. The sniper's henchmen, automatic weapons at the ready, prepare to open fire as one of them knocks on the door. A steel machete bursts through the door, through the henchman's forehead and out the back of his skull. Seeing this, the sniper orders his remaining henchmen to burst in and get him.Machete ambushes one of the henchmen, gruesomely killing him with a wine corkscrew. Hearing the man's death-scream, the sniper reaches into his car and pulls out a wired C4 brick, hurling it through one of the windows. As Machete kills the remaining henchmen, Sartana drives up to the house, looking to question Luz about Machete. She sees the sniper drive off as Luz's house explodes, hurling one of the dead henchmen away from the blast to land right on the hood of Sartana's car. She screams in horror and jams on full reverse, driving away.Machete is limping away from the house when Sartana finally finds him. Pulling her gun, she orders him into her car... and calls him 'Agent,' revealing she also knows who Machete is.As Sartana drives, she and Machete talk. Sartana reveals she is with ICE, but she doesn't plan to bring Machete in... she wants information that she knows Machete has. Sartana is looking to transfer to a different job within her company, tired of working over Luz and the laborers who gather at her taco stand, admitting that the guilt arising from her own Mexican heritage is getting to her. She questions Machete on the assassination attempt and he tells her that he was planning just to shoot McLaughlin in the neck, rendering him mute and stop his propaganda campaign. He then reveals it was all a set-up and another shooter was there. Sartana, amazed, turns toward Machete and asks who it was.Taking advantage of the distraction, Machete grabs the gear shift for Sartana's car and yanks on it, causing Sartana to lose control of her car and forcing her to jam her foot on the brakes before she crashes. Machete disarms her quickly and points the gun at her, telling her to resume driving. Calming down, Sartana reveals she knows what happened to Machete's family, but she begs him to trust her, because she believes the system works here... she started in ICE as a janitor, working her way up through translator, assistant, and to her current position as special agent. Machete however, dismisses this as another method for Sartana's superiors to get her to continue 'taking out the trash.' She continues trying to plead with him, looking to put Machete into witness protection if he just tells her who hired him for the hit on McLaughlin... but Machete doesn't answer.Booth and the sniper are getting a fax that identifies just who the 'nobody' day laborer they hired for the hit, really was, finally understanding that he is serious business. A wireless conference call on Booth's laptop is connecting him to Torrez, who asks if the sniper is the man Booth assigned to kill Machete. He's disappointed at Booth's high tolerance for failure-- but Booth says he is not tolerant, and proves it by garotting the sniper to death right in front of the monitor so Torrez can see. Booth then announces he is calling in Osiris Amanpour, the deadliest, most notorious professional hit-man in Texas, to deal with Machete. But this is not enough to get Booth off the hook-- Torrez warns Booth that he has 24 hours. After that, Torrez will be forced to come up to Texas himself-- and if he has to do it, then after he kills Machete, he will kill Booth as well.Sartana has brought Machete home and is fixing him a meal in hopes that it will persuade him to talk. Machete doesn't know Booth or who he is, just that he is not Mexican, and Luz doesn't know anything about him either, meaning the Network isn't involved in the assassination attempt. Machete tells Sartana that Booth paid him $150,000 to do the job, though he doesn't tell Sartana why he took the money. Sartana continues trying to reason with Machete. She knows that he is essentially a man with no country now-- he has no legal papers for American residence and couldn't hope to return to Mexico. She can get him documentation, but he needs to work with her... starting by telling her who hired him for the McLaughlin hit.Seeing that Sartana's hand has edged close to the knife she used in preparing the meal for him, Machete points her gun at her again and tells her that he is going to find the man who hired him and deliver him to Sartana. To win her trust, he hands Sartana's gun back to her before leaving her home. Sartana is sardonic at his exit, saying she knows he took the bullets out of the gun before returning it... but then she checks the clip and finds she was wrong-- Machete returned the gun to her fully loaded, trusting her not to use it to arrest him again.A day laborer named Julio (Daryl Sabara) and a friend of his are arriving at Luz's house, horrified to see it in ruins... but Luz comes up behind them, showing she is alive and well, and can't be taken down that easily. She thinks that Von was behind the bombing of her house and tells Julio that Von's gone to war with them. Smiling slyly, Luz tells them she wants to show them something. She does not notice Sartana driving up to the house.Luz takes Julio and his friend to her garage, showing an impressive arsenal of high-tech firepower. Still, she says, it's not enough for 'the revolution.' She's not going to be around forever, and if something happens to her, she says, Julio needs to find Machete and tell the people that they need him.Sartana walks in and confronts Luz, gun drawn. When she asks where Machete is, there is a brief moment of panic, Julio certain that Sartana is looking to deport them all. Sartana assures Julio and Luz that Machete's told her that they were not involved in the McLaughlin shooting. Still, she knows that the garage is a hiding place for something, and she wants to know what.Warily, Luz shows Sartana everything... the garage is her headquarters for The Network. The walls are covered with cork boards on which are placed photographs with notes on people she's helped get across, find work, and she makes sure they all do their part in becoming productive workers that help others in turn. She also has a board for people that are missing, presumably to Von and his vigilantes. Another board has photos and clippings of Von and his men. Luz doesn't know who is funding him, but Von's efforts are making a mess of Luz's operations. Her network does go very deep, including lawyers, priests and doctors of all backgrounds and races.Sartana reassures Julio that she's not going to blow the whistle on what she's learned. She's going to walk away quietly and pretend she hasn't seen it. As she leaves, she tells Luz and Julio to let Machete know she's looking for him.Machete goes to a Catholic church. The Padre there (Cheech Marin) was once a fellow Federale with Machete, who has retired from that business and joined the Priesthood. And yet, he is the one Machete is now turning to for help with Booth and all his henchmen. Padre says he'll try to help Machete however he can, though he is very unenthused at having to call on his former skills once again.Padre takes booth to his office in the church, Turning on a TV, he shows Machete footage of McLaughlin and Booth giving a press conference shortly after the assassination attempt. Machete points Booth out as the man who hired him and finds out for the first time just who Booth really is-- he's an aide to Senator McLaughlin himself. Booth comes into Padre's church a lot to make confession; mostly for improper and indecent fantasies involving April. Padre gives Machete a 'file' he compiled on Booth: typed transcripts and audio CD recordings of confessionals showing that Booth had confided a great deal of his life's goings-on to Padre. Padre has been keeping this file ever since he found out Booth was running his own drug cartel, a dealing Padre believes that even McLaughlin doesn't know about. The question at this point, which neither Machete nor Padre have any idea on at the moment, is why Booth would hire Machete to kill McLaughlin if the Senator is Booth's own boss. Padre tells Machete that his presence in the church isn't safe-- for Padre himself. He gives Machete a hurried, tossed-off church absolution and ushers him out. But as Machete leaves, he tells Padre he's borrowing his car-- a hearse that Padre keeps for a side-business... funerals.Machete goes to Booth's house. He finds his way to the shed and grabs some gardening tools so he can pose as a hired gardener. Two of Booth's guards let him past, directing him toward the back yard to clean up there. As Machete goes on his way, the guards resume their idle conversation; one is sardonic about how people will let any Mexican person into their home when they're carrying gardening tools, when in fact they could also have a chainsaw... or a machete.The guards whirl around just in time for one of them to get whacked by a thrown tool. Machete knocks both guards out, ties them up and dumps them in some high foliage around the front yard. He then finds his way to the swimming pool, where April is setting up a hidden video camera to shoot more footage of her making out with a man, to post on the internet. And this time, her mother, June, is going to join in for a threesome. April and June note that Machete is not the usual gardener, but deciding that he looks more than ruggedly handsome enough, they invite him into the pool. Machete is shown holding a bottle of 'scorpion tequila' before he starts undressing.Machete gets in the pool, making out with both April and June. He's then seen taking the video camera and depositing April and June, both still naked and now unconscious from the drugged tequila, into the back of the hearse. He goes to Booth's office and steals a number of recordable DVD's which he knows contain a lot of sensitive information, although he finds they are encrypted so he cannot access and view them on Booth's laptop. Finally he puts the video camera, with a sticky note saying, 'watch me,' into the box where Booth kept the DVD's.Machete brings the still-unconscious April and June to the church. Padre is incensed but is reluctant for Machete to simply dump the two women in the street somewhere.Booth arrives home, disconcerted at finding the whole house seemingly unoccupied. He goes to his office and sees his DVD box open. He finds the video camera and plays its footage as the note directs him to, shocked and horrified as he sees the footage of April and June making out with Machete. Booth's cell phone rings. Thinking it's Machete, he furiously demands to know where his family is. The call, however, is from Osiris. He's found out about Padre, and his relation to Machete.A re-election TV commercial for McLaughlin is shown, exploiting the shooting for sympathy votes. The narration mentions that after taking a vow to defend the state constitution, he has now also taken a bullet for it.Night time at the hospital where McLaughlin is still recovering. He gets a call on a cell phone he's been keeping hidden-- it's Von. Von has heard that McLaughlin has a problem that Von can help fix. Despite the clear business relationship between McLaughlin and Von, their civil relationship is not quite so cordial-- McLaughlin needs to keep any hint that he has ever spoken to Von at all, quiet and under wraps, lest Von's bad reputation as a border vigilante rub off on him.Von is talking to his right-hand man, Billy (Billy Blair) about the shooter. Von knows he's gone underground. He tells Billy that he way to find him is to find the Network. He then says they need to call their 'special friend' and ask him to send a lot of heavy firepower if he's serious about wanting the border shut down. A monitor near Von lights up to show his 'special friend...' it's Torrez.Machete brings all the evidence he has on Booth to Sartana. She plays them on her laptop. One shows video footage of Booth explaining the assassination idea to, of all people, Padre. A motive for the set-up is finally revealed... if an assassination attempt on the Senator by a Mexican was foiled, and McLaughlin ended up with only a flesh wound in the leg, enough public sympathy would be generated to not only get McLaughlin re-elected, but even become a viable White House candidate.Sartana and Machete cannot, however, access the encrypted sub-folders on the DVD. But the confessional itself contains a hint to the password: Machete looks at confessional footage revealing Booth's twisted sexual desires for his daughter and guesses the password to be 'I (heart symbol) April.' Instantly the encrypted files snap open and Sartana is astonished at what they reveal. Everything comes together now: the partnerships between McLaughlin and Booth, Von Jackson... and Torrez. Machete is grim as he finds out that Torrez is the kingpin behind everything. Sartana finds that Torrez is funding McLaughlin's re-election campaign because he actually wants the electrified border fence built... but the DVD also shows special 'weak spots' along the fence... spots that would allow Torrez to gain a complete monopoly control over all illegal drugs being run from Mexico into the United States.Sartana drinks as she puts the whole plot together, and by the time everything is figured out, she's become intoxicated. Machete takes her shoes off her feet and lays her in her bed. Sleepily, she invites him to come lay with her. Machete slowly takes off his leather jacket and gets into the bed.Luz is closing and locking up her garage when she is confronted by Von and Billy. Von believes that Luz is behind the shooting of McLaughlin. He's found out she's with the Network and believes she is at the head of practically all of McLaughlin's problems. Luz tells Von that she doesn't work that way, but if Von wants a war, she'll give him one. Von suggests instead an eye for an eye... before pulling his gun and shooting Luz-- right in her eye, leaving her barely alive and clinging to life in the road.Osiris is entering the church with henchmen, but Padre sees them coming on a security system he's installed to watch out for burglars. Knowing immediately these men are bad news, Padre (a little reluctantly) grabs two loaded, high-powered shotguns, getting ready to put his former skills as an ex-Federal to good use.Knowing the layout of the church grounds far better than the would-be assassins, Padre gains the element of surprise and takes out all of the henchmen, leaving Osiris alone against him... or so Padre thinks. Padre nearly gets the drop on Osiris as well, but his leg is suddenly gravely wounded by a firearm blast... coming from Booth, who coolly walks in and greets Padre sardonically.Booth and Osiris crucify Padre, nailing his arms to the cross that is at the church's altar, interrogating him to learn Machete's whereabouts. Padre is aghast at the thought that Booth hates Mexican people that much, but Booth denies this-- it's all about money and profit; a more secure border that only Torrez knows how to circumvent limits drug supply and drives prices up. Even McLaughlin himself doesn't know about Booth's connection to Torrez and being so heavily involved in the drug trade. Booth gives Padre one last chance to tell him where Machete is. But Padre tells him nothing, knowing he is dead either way. Driving more nails in as hard as he and Osiris can, Booth gives Padre his death.Sartana wakes up, sober, finding herself snuggling with Machete and surprised at it. She hurries to check her clothes, sighing with relief at seeing that Machete did not take advantage of her while she was drunk. Smiling at the realization, she turns over and snuggles again, putting her head back on his shoulder. Machete slowly awakens and starts to roll Sartana off of him. She's reluctant, but Machete is not being merely modest this time... he sees silhouettes through the curtained windows. More assassins have found them.Machete and Sartana spring into action, killing all of their would-be slayers... Sartana winning a hilariously choreographed one-on-one battles using a pair of stilleto-heeled shoes as weapons against the masked leader of the assassins. She pulls off his mask, stunned to recognize him as Culebra Cruzado, an elite professional hit man. Sartana and Machete realize that if he was called in, then Booth knows about Sartana and is looking to have her taken out as well. Machete suddenly mumbles, 'my hermano' and rushes off to the church with Sartana.Staring at Padre's crucified body, Machete takes out the cell phone Booth gave him. He sends Booth a stern warning via text message: 'You just f[CENSORED]ed with the wrong Mexican.' As Machete leaves the church, Sartana glances up and happens to notice a security camera that she realizes caught footage of Padre's murder.Booth receives Machete's text, knowing that Machete is coming after him now. Torrez appears on Booth's monitor via conference call. Behind Torrez is a view of the Texas capitol building, showing he is in Austin. He's come to kill Machete... and he tells Booth that Machete's death is the last thing Booth will see. In desperation, Booth tries to bribe Torrez by telling him about Sartana, saying that she is an ICE agent who now has enough evidence on both Booth and Torrez to bring down the entire operation.Machete storms Booth's home, taking out the bodyguards easily. The bodyguard chief hands Machete a GPS device that will lead Machete right to McLaughlin's limo, and Booth is with the Senator now; he is due to be released from the hospital.Sartana is on the phone with her boss, Jonas, telling him all about the conspiracy she's uncovered. She listens in complete disbelief as Jonas rails on, only about Machete being Mexican and an illegal alien. Telling Jonas that she's going to do what's right, she hangs up and walks up to a Spanish-language news building, handing over an envelope to one of the news correspondents.McLaughlin is scheduled to be interviewed by the press as he is released from the hospital. He and Booth argue over TV coverage of Padre's murder and that it appears that Machete was involved. McLaughlin is no longer buying Booth's argument of Machete being a 'nobody' and a 'cockroach' that will 'soon be squashed;' he knows that Machete is a one-man killing machine and he doesn't want to be next.As he is released from the hospital, McLaughlin goes to meet with the press; Booth beside him. Booth has given McLaughlin a cane so he can feign a more serious injury to milk the crowd for sympathy. McLaughlin launches smoothly into his anti-immigrant propaganda, quickly bringing out his heavy-artillery words of 'terrorist' and 'invader.' But the correspondent who met with Sartana is attending the conference, and she quickly lowers the boom on McLaughlin and Booth. The press coverage quickly shows everyone video footage not only of Booth murdering Padre, saying, out loud, that he was martyring McLaughlin to get the border fence built... but also of McLaughlin cold-bloodedly killing the young Mexican man and his pregnant wife in the border shooting with Von Jackson.McLaughlin and Booth race out of the hospital into McLaughlin's limo where they have it out in a heated exchange of words. Booth furiously shouts that he was practically McLaughlin's personal Jesus and virtually owns his soul. McLaughlin angrily pulls a revolver and shoots Booth several times in the chest, before carjacking a taxi to make his escape. Machete arrives then, his trademark machete ready to carry out his own execution... but finds himself late to the party; Booth mortally wounded in the rear seat and McLaughlin nowhere in sight. Like a sinner making deathbed repentance, Booth tells Machete everything he needs to know about the partnership with Torrez, using the orchestrating shooting of McLaughlin to ensure that Torrez would gain complete control over the Mexican drug runs into the United States. He begs to know where April and June are, and Machete only says, 'with God.' Dryly remarking that he won't be seeing them in that case, Booth dies from his gunshot wounds.April and June finally wake up from their drugged stupor; finding themselves still naked and in the office of Padre's church. June picks up the phone to call for help and notify her husband... only to receive the grim news that Booth is dead; shot by Senator McLaughlin. Staring in sick grief and anger, April fixates her gaze on a nun's habit hanging on a clothing hook in the office.At Von Jackson's compound, men are rehearsing combat drills. McLaughlin calls Von, who is infuriated at TV coverage that has revealed his ties to Torrez's drug cartel. He holds McLaughlin responsible. McLaughlin says Machete has to be smoked out, and he wants to personally put the bullet in Machete's head. He says he is joining Von and his men for one last 'ride-along.'Day Laborers are gathered at Luz's taco stand, laying wreaths and memorials. As Machete arrives, Julio quickly finds him, telling him that Von's vigilantes killed Luz and are now after Machete. Speaking like a leader himself now, Julio tells Machete that the people need him to spearhead the war on Von. Despite being adopted, he wants to help. Machete starts to rebuff Julio's offer, when Julio stuns Machete by repeating Machete's own words three years ago to his slain partner: 'if not us, then who?' strongly implying that Julio is the son of the partner killed at Machete's side in the encounter with Torrez three years prior.Julio takes Machete to an auto chop shop where he works. His co-workers have all of the firepower Luz was keeping stashed at her garage and are preparing for war. Machete tells Julio that attacking Von will lead them to Torrez.Sartana arrives at the taco stand, trying to question the Day Laborers about Machete. But the laborers, none of them trusting Sartana any further than they can throw the taco stand, quickly turn their backs and walk away from her-- until Sartana finally climbs up onto the hood of her car and passionately begs the workers to join forces and fight against the people who are trying to get them expelled from America. Finally renouncing everything she's worked for in front of the laborers and defining the difference between laws, and what is right and wrong, Sartana wins over the laborers and earns their respect. They shout in unison, ready to organize the whole Network into action.None of them notice one man congratulating Sartana on her speech and likening her unto Machete, saying she's Machete's kind of person... dead. The man is Torrez.Cell phones spring to life all across the city; Mexican laborers spreading word as the Spanish-language Noticias news station reports on Booth's murder at the hands of McLaughlin after the revelation of Torrez having funded McLaughlin's re-election campaign. At the chop-shop, Julio tells Machete that McLaughlin and Torrez have gone to Von's armory to prepare for battle, and that Sartana is now Torrez's captive. Getting into cars and onto motorcycles, the laborers all follow behind Machete and Julio.McLaughlin arrives at Von's compound, but finds the welcome nowhere near as warm as he'd hoped. Considering McLaughlin in league with Mexican illegal immigrants and guilty of treason against the state of Texas, Von is preparing to have McLaughlin executed, and the execution broadcast on live TV. As McLaughlin is led away, Billy orders all the other men to their posts to prepare for the assault that they know Machete is going to lead on the compound.Tied to a chair in a shed, McLaughlin is forced to announce in front of a camera that he has betrayed his oaths of office and deserves to die as a traitor. Meanwhile, the convoy of laborers-turned-revolutionaries arrives at Von's compound. Julio's car is fitted with hood-mounted RPG launchers that blow open the gate and take out a high tower suitable for Von's men to launch artillery fire of their own. The revolutionaries charge into the compound and the battle erupts. Slowly the battle starts to turn cheesier and campier as reinforcements arrive for the Mexican people... Doc Felix's ambulance; his two sexy nurses pickin gup discarded automatic weapons and commencing fire on Von's men... and out of the ambulance steps Luz; alive and well; an eyepatch over the eye she was shot in... dressed and armed like Rambo's daughter.Von and his firing squad must postpone the execution of McLaughlin and rush outside to help battle the revolutionaries. Luz and some revolutionaries find their way into the shed, where Luz tells McLaughlin that if he wants to live, he needs to become Mexican quickly. Happy to fight for whatever side will ensure his own survival, McLaughlin dons denim clothes and a hat similar to the revolutionaries' attire, and is given a pistol.The battle quickly escalates into a hilarious blend of Rambo meets the A-Team; Von's men slowly being decimated by the revolutionaries; Luz and Machete bagging the most casualties. Billy flees the armory with a few men, abandoning the rest. McLaughlin is suddenly struck by a hearse that pulls into the compound. The fallen senator isn't quite sure he trusts his own senses when he sees a beautiful young Catholic nun walk up to him. He pleads with her to give him last rites, thinking he's dying. But the nun is April, wearing the habit she'd taken from Padre's office... and ready to carry out her own form of justice. She shoots Mclaughlin three times in the chest, before picking up an automatic weapon and joining the battle.Seeing he has lost the war, Von gets to his jeep, gunning down a few revolutionaries as he seeks to escape the compound. He barely gets past the door when he sees Luz's reflection in his rear-view mirror. It is the last thing he sees.Machete, however, has one last battle to fight. Torrez confronts him; his henchwoman/slave girl holding Sartana, who is bound and gagged. Torrez uses his katana to free Sartana, before ordering both women to back up and watch the duel.Torrez baits Machete as they battle; Torrez's katanas against Machete's machetes. Torrez speaks about their past together as fellow Federales before Torrez went for power instead of honor. They killed a lot of 'bad guys' together, but now Torrez is the bad guy.Machete makes a lunge for Torrez; who disarms him and throws him to the ground. He prepares to behead Machete, but Machete's blade is close by. He grabs it and drives it clean through Torrez's middle. Acting like the wound is hardly serious and that he could kill Machete now, Torrez instead 'relents,' tossing his katana aside and going to his knees, grabbing the machete and disemboweling himself; committing hara-kiri in front of all the combatants The henchwoman/slave girl, the sole survivor of the altercation who was against the immigrants, walks off alone. Machete, Luz, and Sartana all climb up on car hoods as the victorious revolutionaries raise their weapons and cheer in victory.In the middle of the night, at the wreckage of the armory, ex-senator McLaughlin awakens; he had been given a bulletproof vest by Luz, which protected him from April's bullets, though his leg and hip are still hurt from being struck by the hearse. Using the cover of night, he goes to the border, looking to escape into Mexico, where he is found by Billy and the few survivors of Von's army who escaped the compound. Not recognizing McLaughlin due to the darkness and McLaughlin's still wearing the laborer clothing, Billy and his men gun McLaughlin down, leaving him entangled in the barbed-wire fence, Billy repeating McLaughlin's own quote from the border shooting: 'welcome to America.'Machete is driving down the road on a motorcycle when a police car pulls up behind him and blares its siren. Machete stops, and Sartana steps out of the car. She's pulled some strings and gotten Machete legal documentation for permanent resident status in America. But Machete refuses the papers, saying he has no need to become a 'real person' again now that he is already a myth among Mexicans struggling to make a life in America. Saying she'll ride with him wherever he goes, Sartana climbs onto the motorcycle and starts making out with Machete as he drives off.Fade to black, with a narrator giving the obligatory 'of course the entire world will cease to exist unless you get an entire crapton of sequels' pitch, complete with appropriate captions:Machete will return in:: MACHETE KILLS!And in: MACHETE KILLS AGAIN!"

Leap Year,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216492/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Anna Brady plans to travel to Dublin, Ireland to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy on February 29, leap day, because, according to Irish tradition, a man who receives a marriage proposal on a leap day must accept it. A woman who has an elaborate scheme to propose to her boyfriend on Leap Day, an Irish tradition which occurs every time the date February 29 rolls around, faces a major setback when bad weather threatens to derail her planned trip to Dublin. With the help of an innkeeper, however, her cross-country odyssey just might result in her getting engaged.—Anonymous Busy as she is as a Boston stager, Anna Brady likes to control all aspects of her life. One of the few things she has not been able to control is getting married; her boyfriend, cardiologist Dr. Jeremy Sloane, has not yet proposed to her after four years of dating. She hates the story told often to her by her father Jack Brady that there is an Irish tradition that allows women to propose to their loved one on February 29, which is what purportedly got her paternal grandparents together. Anna hates surprise herself, but she decides to surprise Jeremy by showing up in Dublin, where he is attending a conference, and proposing to him on Leap Day. But her trek from Boston to Dublin is anything but smooth. She gets stranded in Dingle, her unintended entry into Ireland, a few days before Leap Day. Despite their antagonistic meeting, struggling pub/innkeeper Declan O'Callaghan agrees to drive Anna to Dublin... for a price; the agreed-upon fare would cover much of his debt, which would allow him to keep the pub/inn. Largely because of their antagonism, Anna, Declan and their third, Louis (what Declan calls her Louis Vuitton suitcase), get into one misadventure after another, which threatens Anna's arrival to Dublin by February 29. Through their time together, Anna and Declan might find that there are more important things in life than having that fairytale February 29 proposal and saving the pub/inn through extortion of Anna.—Huggo When yet another anniversary passes without a marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Anna decides to take action. Aware of a Celtic tradition that allows women to pop the question on Feb. 29, she plans to follow her lover to Dublin and ask him to marry her. Fate has other plans, however, and Anna winds up on the other side of the Emerald Isle with handsome but surly Declan an Irishman who might just lead Anna down the road to true love.—yusufpiskin Anna Brady of Boston is a planner who stages apartments for Realtors; she's been dating cardiologist Jeremy for four years and they are buying a high-standard apartment in Davenport together. She expects him to propose to her on a dinner date, but he doesn't; soon after he travels to Dublin for a conference. She decides to join him there on February 29 and propose to him, in accordance with an Irish folklore tradition from the Fifth Century of Leap-Year proposals by women. However, bad weather forces her plane to land in Wales and she can't find a connection because the Dublin airport is closed. She decides to travel on a supply vessel but a storm forces her to disembark in Dingle. Anna walks to the only restaurant and inn and hires the unfriendly owner, Declan, to drive her to Dublin. Declan agrees to drive her as he needs the money to pay off his debts, but their journey is fraught with incidents.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Successful real estate agent Anna Brady is frustrated that her cardiologist boyfriend Jeremy Sloane still has not proposed to her after four years. She decides to travel from Boston to Dublin, to propose to him on February 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. Anna wishes to invoke an Irish tradition that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal.During the flight, a storm diverts the plane to Wales, where Anna hires a boat to take her to Cork. The severity of the storm, however, forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called Dingle, where she makes her way to a local tavern. Anna tries to enlist the help of Declan O'Callaghan, the surly Irish innkeeper. She requests him to taxi her across the country to Dublin. At first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for EUR500. The two set out in his old beat-up car. Along the way, he makes fun of her fancy Louis Vuitton luggage, which he calls ""Louie"". He also mocks her belief in a leap year ""tradition"" of women proposing to men.Their travel is interrupted by a herd of cows blocking the road. Anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her expensive shoes while leaning on Declan's car which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. Continuing on foot, Anna flags down a van with three travellers who offer her a lift. Ignoring Declan's warning, Anna accepts the ride and hands them her luggage. Before she can enter the van, they drive off without her. Anna and Declan eventually make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three van thieves going through Anna's luggage. Declan fights them, displaying unexpected strength for a man of his size, and retrieves Anna's bag. Anna and Declan are ejected from the pub by the owner for fighting on the premises.Anna and Declan reach a railway station and decide to wait for the next train. While waiting, they hike up a hill to the ruins of a nearby castle. They ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. In doing so, Declan also tells Anna of an old Irish legend about a young woman engaged to an elderly lord that she did not love. So the woman gave her wedding guests a sleeping potion so she could run away with a young Celtic warrior she did love. During the story, they lose track of time and miss the train. That night, Anna and Declan are forced to stay at a local bed & breakfast in Tipperary, where they pretend to be married, taking the name ""O'Brady-Callaghan"" so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. During dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, Anna and Declan are ""forced"" to kiss as well. This stirs feelings that neither had expected. That night, they sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other.The next day while hitch-hiking down the road, Anna and Declan are caught in a hail-storm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. They are invited to the reception. But during the reception, Anna drinks too much. Anna begins to question her own intentions with Jeremy and realizes that she has feelings for Declan. Just as the two are about to kiss, Anna vomits and passes out. The following day they arrive in Dublin, as they make their way on foot from the bus terminal to the hotel, Declan reveals that he was once engaged but his fiancee ran off to Dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. Anna suggests to Declan, now that he is in Dublin, that he should ask for his mother's ring back. When they arrive at the hotel where Jeremy is staying, Jeremy surprises Anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. Anna turns around to look at Declan just to see that he had already walked out of the hotel, and she accepts Jeremy's proposal.At their engagement party in Boston, Anna learns that Jeremy decided to propose because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple had wanted to move into at the beginning of the film. Dismayed, Anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she had discussed with Declan earlier. When the alarm sounds, Jeremy's instinct is to retrieve all of their electronic materials such as mobile phones, laptops, etc and shows no concern for Anna's well-being. At that moment, Anna fully realizes that there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including Jeremy. Meanwhile, back in Dublin, Declan retrieves his mother's claddagh ring from his ex-fiancee.Sometime later, Anna arrives back at Caragh's Tavern in Dingle, where Declan is running his seemingly successful business, having pulled together the balance he owed to his property owner with the help of the community. Anna reveals to him that she has broken off her engagement to Jeremy and tells Declan that she has come to believe that all she needs/wants is right in Dingle. When she proposes that they get together, ignoring her controlling nature and saying they should not make plans, Declan leaves the room. Thinking that she had been rejected, Anna rushes outside and makes her way to the edge of a nearby cliff overlooking the sea.Declan emerges, revealing that he went out simply to retrieve his mother's claddagh ring so that he could give it to her. Taking her offer even further, Declan says he wants to make plans with her, and proposes on the cliffside. Anna happily accepts, and they are later seen in Declan's car, leaving their destination open to fate."

Matt falls overboard into the whirlpool, and is violently eaten by the school of piranha, leaving Matt's mangled body behind.Meanwhile, spring break descends upon Lake Victoria, bringing thousands of college students to the area. Lake Victoria Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue) is having a difficult time juggling drunken college students, recent earthquake reports, and her normal duties. Her 17-year-old son, Jake (Steven R. McQueen) looks on as his mother arrests a particularly rowdy frat-boy. Jake takes in the spring break party atmosphere as he goes to pick up his little 10-year-old sister, Laura (Brooklynn Proulx) from music class. On the way Jake crosses paths with Kelly (Jessica Szohr), a local girl for whom he harbors a huge crush. Kelly invites Jake to come to a backstage party at a concert, with tickets procured by the local bully Todd. Todd and his friend arrive. They see Kelly talking with Jake, throw a slushy at Jake's shirt, ruining it, and give him the finger. Feeling awkward, Kelly leaves with Todd. Jake goes to find Laura. Laura talks with Danni (Kelly Brook), a local Girls Gone Wild-ish glamour model in town to shoot a video with her boss and porn director Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell). Jake arrives, and is reluctantly enlisted to be Derrick's location scout, due to his familiarity with the area. Derrick offers to pay Jake for a day's work and Jake accepts.That night Julie and Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames) are called out to investigate the disappearance of Matthew Boyd. They arrive at his fishing spot; discover his empty boat, and ultimately his mangled corpse. They consider shutting down the lake. At home, Jake learns about Derrick Jones from a porn-site, and is interrupted by his mother, Julie, who orders him to stay at home the next day, to babysit his little brother Zane (Sage Ryan), and sister Laura. Jake agrees to stay home and watch the kids tomorrow.The next day Julie and Fallon learn that in addition to patrolling spring breakers, they must accompany a team of seismologists to investigate the newly opened chasm in the lake caused by the earthquake. Team leader Novak (Adam Scott), and divers Sam (Ricardo Chavira) and Paula (Dina Meyer) take Julie's patrol boat out to the chasm. Sam and Paula swim down into the chasm. Paula waits at the chasm opening, to maintain radio contact, as Sam swims into the massive underwater lake. There, Sam discovers tens of thousands of unhatched piranha eggs. Sam is suddenly bitten, and bleeds into the water. The piranhas appear and eat Sam. Novak jumps in after them. He attempts to save Paula, who is swiftly eaten. Bringing Paula aboard, Novak and Julie discover a Piranha, which had attached itself to her corpse, flopping around on the deck. They trap the fish, and immediately take it to local Pet Shop owner, Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd). Goodman identifies the piranha as an extremely violent, cannibalistic species which went extinct two million years earlier. They decide to evacuate Lake Victoria.Meanwhile, Jake shirks his babysitting duties, and agrees to pay Laura and Zane $60 in exchange for lying to their Mom and staying in the house. Jake makes his way to Derrick's boat, and watches Danni and another model named Crystal (Riley Steele) dance provocatively on the deck. As Jake is about to board, he runs into Kelly, who confesses that Todd lied about having back stage passes, and asks why he isn't babysitting his siblings. Derrick interrupts their conversation, being both inebriated and attracted to Kelly, he invites her aboard the party boat. Kelly agrees, to Jake's annoyance. On board Jake meets Derrick's camera man Drew (Paul Scheer). The group travels to a remote part of the lake, where Drew and Derrick film Danni and Crystal swimming nude beneath the glass-bottomed boat.Laura and Zane, bored at home, break Jake's promise and take a canoe out to go fishing. They dock at an island, and accidentally lose their canoe, stranding them both. They manage to flag down Jake on Derrick's boat, and realizing that they are the local sheriff's kids, and that he is covered in blow, Derrick fearfully allows them to board. Laura and Zane peer out through the boat's glass bottom, and see many Piranhas swimming beneath them.Back at the beach, Julie and Fallon order an evacuation, which is promptly ignored by the partygoers. The piranhas arrive and kill many partygoers, forcing the survivors to flee for higher ground. Notable deaths include the cowardly Todd, who commandeers a motorboat, runs over and kills many injured people still in the water, until his engine stalls and his boat is capsized. Party Animal (Eli Roth) is decapitated by an oncoming boat. Fallon grabs an outboard motor, and wielding it like a chainsaw, shreds numerous Piranhas until he is overcome by them, and killed when they literally eat his feet off. Novak seizes a skidoo and a shotgun, saving as many people as he can, and the survivors make their way out of the water.Derrick, now high on cocaine, demands that they move to a new shooting location. With Drew driving, the boat is entangled in a mass of seaweed. Angrily, Derrick takes control of the boat, accelerates, breaks free from the seaweed, and slams into some underwater rocks. The glass bottom is shattered, and with Kelly trapped below deck, water and piranhas begin to flood into the boat. Derrick, Drew, and Crystal are thrown overboard. Drew and Crystal are immediately killed as Derrick swims back to the boat. With Derrick clinging to the side of the boat, Jake and Danni manage to pull him aboard, shocked to find that most of his legs, and genitals, have been eaten by the piranhas. Derrick seemingly dies, and Danni places a beach towel over his corpse.More and more piranhas swarm into the boat, threatening Kelly, who is still trapped below. Jake attempts to pull Kelly to safety through a skylight, which is too small for her. Jake finally calls his mother on his phone. Julie answers, and with Novak at her side, they steal a speedboat. Below deck, Kelly bats off Piranhas with a frying pan. Julie and Novak arrive, carefully reverse towards Derrick's sinking boat, and toss a tow-cable across to Jake, who ties it off to the deck. Julie, suspended over the water, shimmies across the cable to Derrick's boat. Danni, Laura, Zane, and Julie cross back over to the speedboat, as numerous piranha leap out of the water, trying to eat them. A piranha snags Danni's long hair. She falls into the water and is quickly eaten alive. Laura, Zane, and Julie make their way to the speedboat, and watch as Jake unties the tow-cable. Intending to save Kelly, he grabs Derrick's still-not-dead corpse, lobs it over the side, distracts the piranhas long enough to swim under the boat with the tow-cable. Jake opens the valves on the boat's propane tanks, lights two flares, and gives Novak the signal to step on the gas. Jake and Kelly are yanked out of the boat, just seconds before the entire boat explodes, killing all the piranha within a few hundred feet. Jake and Kelly are towed back to the speed boat, and hoisted on deck, mostly uninjured.Happily, Julie, Novak, Jake, Kelly, Laura and Zane breathe a sigh of relief. Julie's radio suddenly crackles. Goodman is on the other end. Goodman tells her that upon further inspection, the Piranha specimen he has in his tank, and all the other piranhas in the lake, lack reproductive organs and are fundamentally babies. Novak jokes, wondering what an adult piranha would look like. Suddenly, a giant, shark-sized piranha leaps up on to the deck, eating Novak."

Sally brings a wrench and removes the bolts of the ashpit cover and soon discovers the owners of the voices, but Alex and Kim believe it's just her imagination.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The movie starts off at Blackwood Manor some time ago (to the point where they use candles as lights). We see a maid dusting some books in the study when suddenly a bell rings nearby (meaning she is needed). The maid grabs a candle and walks through the dark house until she approaches a stairwell leading to the basement. She calls out for Lord Blackwood, but there is no reply. She begins to walk away when suddenly she hears him call for her. She looks down the stairwell, and we see Lord Blackwood standing in the shadows beckoning for her to come down the stairs. She begins to slowly come down without hesitation. We see Lord Blackwood constantly looking over towards an old, dark fireplace. As she reaches the middle of the stairwell, we see a tripwire has been set and she trips over it and falls down the stairs. Lord Blackwood is obviously in a frightened state, and he stands above the maid. Then he quickly mounts on top of her, and we can hear whispers coming from the fireplace. The maid screams as Lord Blackwood uses his tools to remove her teeth as she screams. We see the majority of his teeth are missing as well, and he can barely speak. The maid is on the floor either passed out or dead as Lord Blackwood goes towards the fireplace with a small ashtray full of teeth. He begs to the creatures to give him his son back as he has collected teeth and offers them as a trade. However, the creatures do not accept it, and a swarm of the rat-like creatures attack him and pull him into the fireplace and down the hole, killing him.Present Day. Sally Hurst (Bailee Madison) is drawing on an airplane. She is very talented but is sitting alone. She arrives at the airport, and we see her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) waiting for her. Kim is obviously very nervous being the new girlfriend and we can tell that Sally and her father rarely ever spend time together. Sally hugs her father but does not seem happy at all and appears very depressed. Kim offers a teddy bear as a welcome gift and Sally hesitantly accepts it.On the ride to Blackwood Manor, we learn a lot. Apparently Sally did not want to leave Los Angeles from her mother at all. Her mother also has her taking Ritalin. Alex hardly acknowledges that his daughter is in the backseat as he constantly brings up his business and trying to sell the Manor. Kim notices this all while riding.Finally, they arrive to the Manor. There are people there working on it to look perfect for the open house party where they will try to sell it. One of the workers is Harris (Jack Thompson), who sort of flinches when he sees Kim and Alex arrive with Sally. Kim sees Sally go into the study from the beginning of the film and Kim goes in to try and lay some ""new mother"" work, so to say. She comes in and tries to befriend Sally who doesn't seem that interested at all. She even goes so far as sliding on one of the sliding bookcases to make it seem fun. Kim also shows Sally a raven crest that her grandmother gave her when she was little. Sally replies by saying ""My mother gave me to my dad"" in a cold way and leaves out the study.Sally goes upstairs where Alex shows her to her room, and Sally asks him how long she has to stay. Alex is surprised and pretty much tries to beat around the obvious; her mother abandoned her and now she has to stay with her father from now on. Sally is angry and sad and exclaims that her mother said Alex only likes Kim because she's younger, but Sally shouts out that she looks old, which Kim overhears. Sally locks herself in the bathroom as her father asks her to come out. Kim is slightly hurt by Sally's words but understands it's because Sally is afraid. Sally eventually comes out and sits in her bed saying she wants to go to sleep. Alex sighs and turns on a nightlight and he and Kim leave the room.That night, Kim and Alex are in bed, and Kim is trying to discuss ways to win Sally's trust. Alex brushes it aside, saying she'll grow to like her. Kim also mentions what Sally said earlier about her mom ""giving"" her to Alex. Alex avoids the question, and they kiss and cuddle in the bed. Sally overhears all of this because of the vents and places a pillow over her vent and goes to sleep. Meanwhile, in the basement, we see that it is covered in dust and cobwebs, and we see the fireplace has been bolted shut, and we hear voices whispering, ""Sally... her name is Sally.""The next morning Sally is sitting on a bench while the workers are outside. She is bored, and so she spells her name on the bench with little rocks. Kim walks outside and waves at her from a distance. Sally waves back then Kim gets back to helping the workers. Then Sally hears voices whispering her name coming from a small forest/garden in the backyard. So she slips away and follows the voices through the garden. We are treated to beautiful scenery, and we see her smile for the first time as she uses a stick as a sort of staff and walks through the garden. While walking through the garden, Sally encounters a ""fairy ring"" of mushrooms. Then suddenly she ends up on the side of the house and sees a bunch of bushes blocking something. She moves through the bushes and sees they are covering windows. She brushes them aside and sees a basement. Suddenly Harris appears and tells her its not safe and quickly tries to lead her away. Kim and Alex show up asking about the commotion. Harris tells her to stay away from back here, and tries to lead her away but Sally protests and points, saying there are windows to a basement. Much to Harris' obvious dismay, she proves it to Alex and Kim, and they go back into the house.Alex grabs a hammer and begins to tear at a hollow wall in the middle of the main hall/stairwell. Kim, Harris, and Sally watch as he reveals a doorway. Kim runs to grab the master key, and they enter the basement that we saw at the beginning of the film. Sally is excited to explore the basement, and Kim is amazed at all that is down there. She mentions that they came upon a great find. Sally looks over towards the bolted fireplace, and she gets closer. She studies it and can hear the voices whispering her name. Alex and Kim tell her that it's time to head back upstairs, and they do so.The next morning while her father isn't paying attention and Kim is speaking to him, Sally sneaks down into the basement with a wrench to open the fireplace. After many successful tries, she knocks one of the bolts off, and as she unscrews the last one. Her father comes downstairs, and she hides the tools. She tells him that she's been hearing voices from the fireplace. The creatures sneakily steal a sharp metal stick, and as her father places his ear to the fireplace, they attempt to stab him, but fail. Neither Sally or Alex notice. Alex goes upstairs and tells her to come, as well. As Sally is going up, the fireplace cover falls, and the hole is exposed. She crouches down and sees the tooth tray, and she takes one of the teeth and puts it in her pocket. Her father calls her upstairs. The voices whisper ""She'll be back, they always come back.""Dinner that night, Sally does not want to eat her rice. Kim tells her that there is some apple pie if she'd prefer that. Sally again declines saying her mother doesn't want her to eat gluten. Alex is angry and tells her that she can either eat the apple pie or go to bed. Sally slams her fork and goes up to her room. Kim shakes her head in disappointment at Alex.That night Sally hears the voices whispering to her through the vents. They ask her to set them free and that they can be her friend. They try to coax her further by telling her that her parents don't want her.She places the tooth under her pillow that night and goes to sleep. Alex notices his shaving blade is missing, and Kim goes to her closet to see what she's going to wear the day of the open house, and she sees her clothes torn in pieces. Alex confronts Sally the next morning and yells at her. Sally constantly says that she didn't do it. Kim is watching from the hallway and appears to believe Sally. Alex notices Sally is gripping something in her hands and sees it is an old coin which Sally claims was under her pillow.The next day Kim and Alex are leaving to go handle some business downtown. Harris, and the cook offer to watch Sally while they are gone. While driving Kim acknowledges the fact that Alex does not seem to be paying much mind to her daughter. But back at the manor, once again Sally slips away downstairs with some raisins and crouches by the hole with a flashlight. The creatures hiss saying they hate the light and so Sally turns it off and sits some raisins on the fireplace offering them to the creatures since they are 'hungry.' The creatures are about to come out when suddenly Harris rushes downstairs with a flashlight asking Sally who she's talking to. She says nobody and he orders to go upstairs ""Now!"". And she does so, Harris props his flashlight to point towards the fireplace while he goes to seal it back up. The creatures whisper to him and call him a fool. Some have already gotten out and knock over a toolbox and his flashlight. He backs away from the fireplace begging to the creatures and saying he hasn't told anyone else anything! The creatures, however, begin to attack, using various items from the toolbox such as boxcutters and scissors, and begin to attack and stab Harris repeatedly, but not killing him. The cook and Sally are standing by the stairwell and hear his screams. Harris comes upstairs, bloodied, with scissors sticking out his shoulder and he collapses.Alex and Kim return home and see that the police are there. They enter, and the cook is crying and in shock, and tells them that Harris had an accident and is in the hospital and she tried to keep Sally from seeing but she saw it anyway. Alex speaks with the police while Kim runs out to the backyard to try and find Sally. She finds her sitting in a tree crying and offers comfort and to show Sally something. She takes Sally into a bush maze and in the center is a beautiful fountain with fish that they imported straight from Japan. Sally begins crying and tells Kim, ""I swear to God I didn't tear your clothes. I swear."" Kim hugs her, saying she doesn't care about the clothes, and she and Sally have gotten somewhat closer.That night, Kim carries Sally to bed and Sally pleads to Kim to stay with her even after she falls asleep. However, sometime in the middle of the night, Kim gets up and leaves the teddy bear next to Sally and goes back to her room.The creatures knock over the carousel night light which causes Sally to wake up. She grabs the flashlight from the table.We see a creature sneak under her covers. She crawls underneath with her flashlight, and as she continues underneath her covers she shines the light on the creature causing it to shriek and her to scream. She tosses her sheet off the bed and screams for her dad and he and Kim quickly enter the room and embrace her as the creatures flee into the one of the vents. Kim notices the light is broken and the teddy bear is torn to shreds.Alex schedules for a therapist to come speak with Sally. He does and begins to question her while they talk about her behavior. She is drawing the whole time as she talks to the therapist. He asks her what she's seeing, and she explains that the creatures that have been talking to her are like evil fairies or gnomes. She has drawn a picture and shows the therapist. He asks what they are saying, and she tells him ""that my parents don't really love me. And that they are my friend."" The therapist tells Alex and Kim, and shows them the drawings. They conclude that the creatures are obviously imaginary. Kim seems skeptical.The next night, Alex and Kim are going out. The cook and a few workers offer to watch Sally for the night. Sally is in her room, and decides to go down the hall to take a bath. As she goes down the hall, we can hear the creatures moving through the vents and following her. She enters the bathroom and closes the door and gets in the tub. Meanwhile, we see Kim dropped Alex off at where they needed to go and goes to visit Harris in the hospital. She tries to ask him questions about the house, and he can barely speak, but he informs Kim to, ""Get...her...out."" Kim asks more questions, but Harris simply gives her instructions to go to a certain library and he gives her the index info for a certain book. She rushes to the library.Back at the house we see Sally in the bathtub and the creatures turn off the light switch. She tries to get lower in the bathtub, and we see a creature run past the curtain.At the library, Kim gets a librarian to lead her to the book, and he explains it was Blackwood's. He tells her of how Blackwood had a son who went missing and then days later Blackwood went missing, as well. Kim never knew this. He also begins to show her long lost pictures Blackwell drew saying Blackwell wrote that there were ancient fairies who ate bones and teeth from their victims and mainly children. He also mentions that the fairies Blackwood mentions must always take one victim so that they can make he/she one of their own. Blackwood drew pictures, and Kim thinks that they are very similar to what Sally has been drawing and the stories she has been telling. The librarian mentions there is a mural somewhere in the house Blackwood made before he died that no one has seen. Kim is shocked by all she has discovered and rushes back to get Alex and go home.Back at home, Sally steps out of the tub and the creatures began to torment and try to attack her. She screams for help and tries to get out but they have broken the lock on the door. She falls into the empty tub as the creatures crawl along the sides and up the curtains with sharp objects. The cook and the workers are trying to break in the door this whole time and just as we think the creatures will get Sally they break in and turn on the lights. The creatures have hidden.Alex and Kim arrive home to the cook, who is in a frantic state once again saying Sally is in her room crying. Kim runs upstairs before Alex and sees Sally is gone. Alex mentions she may have run away because she does that a lot. Kim rushes down to the basement and notices a giant tarp covering a section of the wall in the basement. She removes it and sees the mural the librarian mentioned. It is a painting of a child being sacrificed to the creatures. Kim is stunned.Alex and Kim drive down the road looking for Sally. Kim mentions how she talked to Harris and all that she discovered but, as usual, he fails to listen and brushes it off. They see Sally walking down the road and Alex orders her to get back in the car which she does.The following night it is the night of the open house. Kim is in the room with Sally as they get ready and she finds Alex's shaving blade in Sally's drawer. Sally claims she needs it for protection, but Kim comforts her, saying she'll protect her and they won't get to her. Sally mentions that they hate bright lights. Kim has an idea and gives Sally her camera (very old camera the type that flashes very bright and you have to shake the picture when it comes out). So Sally walks through the party taking pictures as guests arrive. Suddenly, she sees a small vase of flowers moving, and she hears the whispering. She gets close and can see the creature and snaps the picture, the creature freaks out and runs. Sally, excited that she has proof, tries to show her dad but sees the picture hasnt developed yet. Her father goes upstairs and sees that Kim is packing up all of Sally's stuff. They get into a brief argument, but Alex ends it when the cook informs him that the food is done so he goes downstairs.All the guests, Alex, and Sally gather at the table. Sally is steadily shaking the picture for it to develop, but it's taking too long, and the guests keep trying to touch it, so she sits it under leg. Alex is speaking with the guests about the house when suddenly we see one of the creatures under the table attempting to get the photo from under Sally's leg. The guests see her fidget and tugging with something as the creature fights to pull the photo away. She crawls underneath the table while Alex ignores it, and continues talking with the guests. She chases the creature with the camera under the table. This eventually leads her across the hall and into the study where the creatures close the door behind her and lock it. The creatures whisper and taunt her saying nobody will listen and try to attack her. She snaps pictures at every turn to keep the creatures away. They begin to jump on her, and she screams. The guests and Alex hear this and rush to the door. Kim runs downstairs and tries to help get the door open. Sally is fighting with the creatures as they attack her and one of them grabs the camera and begins to crawl up the side of one of the bookcases. Sally sees this and quickly pushes the sliding bookcase into the creature, killing it. The camera falls. Alex and Kim rush in while the guests are looking, and Alex embraces Sally. Sally is crying, saying she has proof, but when she tries to show the only picture she had left it is just a picture of her screaming. The guests all leave and vow to try the dinner again at another time.Sally cries herself to sleep, and Alex goes to lay her in her bed in her room again. He then goes downstairs and stares at the mural of the child being fed to the creatures. Kim comes down and stands next to him. He realizes the need to leave the house and offers to go get the car while Kim goes to get Sally. Kim rushes upstairs and tells Sally they are going to go, but Sally is half sleep. Alex goes to the garage and uses the garage key to open the doors. He gets up and goes to lay pillows and a blanket in the backseat when suddenly the garage doors close. Alex goes back to the front seat to get the opener and notices it is gone. The creatures use a rope to cause Alex to fall and his head smacks the ground, knocking him out. The creatures then crawl towards the power box and cut the wires causing the house to go dark.Kim is in Sally's room while Sally is asleep. She grabs the flashlight off Sally's table and begins to walk through the hallways. She can hear whispering in the dark. As she begins to walk down the stairs in the dark, we see the creatures have set a trip wire as they did before, which causes Kim to fall and cut her shin. As she lies on the floor loosing consciousness because of the fall, she can see the creatures slowly surrounding her, and one of them points upstairs saying, ""Sally."" Kim passes out.Upstairs, Sally awakens and calls out for Kim. She grabs the camera and rushes down the hall and downstairs to sees Kim lying on the floor, knocked out. The creatures began to swarm around her, so Kim and Sally try to use the flash to ward them off, but it does no good. They grab Sally and begin to drag her towards the basement as she drops the camera and continues to scream for Kim. In the garage, Alex has awakened and stands up. He tries to leave out the garage but the door is blocked from the outside.Back in the house, Kim awakens and hears Sally screaming. She struggles to get up, grabs her flashlight, and heads down into the basement. The creatures have Sally tied by her ankles to a rope as they attempt to pull her into the fireplace, and down into the hole. Kim aims her flashlight around the room to try and keep the creatures away and pulls against the creatures to save Sally. All the while Sally is trying to keep the creatures away with the flashlight.Meanwhile, Alex breaks out the garage and runs into the house. One of the doors are locked, keeping him from the basement. As he tries to get through he peeks through the keyhole and the creatures use a sharp needle to try to stab him in the eye, but they miss and get his cheek. In the basement, Kim picks up the box-cutter from earlier and begins to cut through the rope telling Sally that when she cuts the rope she wants her to run. Sally protests saying she won't leave her; the rope is tangled around Kim's shins. Kim cuts the rope, and the creatures are extremely angry. Kim looks down at Sally and gives her one final smile as the creatures pull the rope and cause Kim to smack into the fireplace and her shins to snap backwards. Kim cries out in agony and falls to the ground. The creatures pull Kim down into the hole while Sally screams. Alex breaks his way into the house and rushes downstairs. He sees Kim hanging on to the sides of the fireplace, but he is too late. Kim is pulled completely down into the hole, and she is gone. Sally cries as Alex hugs her and apologizes that he never believed her.A few days later we see Sally and Alex return to the manor in the daytime. There is a giant sign that says ""Foreclosure"". They walk into the manor, and we see Sally has the same hairstyle Kim always wore and the same jacket Kim had the day they met. Sally sits a picture she drew of her and Kim in the doorway and says ""I Love You Kim."" Alex and Sally leave the house and close the door behind him. Seconds later, however, we see the basement door open, and a draft leads the picture Sally drew down into the basement and into the re-bolted fireplace, and it sucks in through the cracks. We hear the creatures whisper what will they do and that soon they will bring others to get them. But then we hear Kim's voice mixed with the creatures whispering as well saying ""We will dig deeper. Soon they will forget. They always do. ""We have all the time in the world,"" and the other creatures repeat after her saying, ""Yes, we have all the time in the world."""
From Paris with Love,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179034/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In Paris, a young employee in the office of the US Ambassador hooks up with an American spy looking to stop a terrorist attack in the city. James Reece is an ambitious aide to the U.S. Ambassador in Paris, doing little jobs for the CIA and hoping to get into black ops. On the night he and his girlfriend, Caroline, become engaged, he's told to pick up Charlie Wax at Orly. Charlie is an unorthodox government employee - large, bald and bearded, foul-mouthed and eccentric. Charlie immediately takes James on a wild ride of murder and mayhem, through ethnic enclaves. As bodies pile up, the purpose remains opaque to James. Caroline, unhappy that James has been out of touch for a day, tells him to bring Charlie for dinner. Charlie can be charming - where will it lead? Does the chess-playing James have what it takes?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Aspiring to become a seasoned CIA operative, the personal aide to the U.S. ambassador in France, James Reese, is summoned to pick up the trigger-happy secret agent, Charlie Wax: his new partner. Against the backdrop of a dangerous and undisclosed mission in the bustling Parisian metropolis, suddenly, the death toll will start to rise, as Charlie prefers to shoot first and ask questions later. Now, in this adrenaline-charged roller-coaster, the stakes are high, and the enemy is everywhere. Is there room for two agents in the same city? In the end, is this the life James truly wants?—Nick Riganas The assistant of the American Ambassador in Paris James Reece is an aspirant spy working in minor jobs for the CIA. James lives with his fiancée Caroline and expects to be promoted to the special operations. When James is assigned to drive the unconventional but efficient agent Charlie Wax in Paris, James learns that a terrorist cell is preparing to attack the American delegation and he is close to the key element that will explode the group of representatives of his government.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The movie opens with James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) driving through the streets of Paris in a black SUV to work. Reece works in the American Embassy as an aide to Ambassador Bennington (Richard Durden), the U.S. Ambassador to France. Taking a delivery of some forms from the Ambassador's secretary, he goes over Bennington's itinerary for the next few days, centering around a major summit in which the U.S., France, and several other nations are preparing foreign aid to the African continent. Bennington shows that he is more absorbed right now in a chess game he's playing with Reece during all this time. Despite paying less attention to the board and the game than Bennington is, Reece quickly checkmates him to win.Reece receives a call from an unknown source (voiced by David Gasman) directing him to a silver BMW in the parking lot, excusing himself with a cover story to Bennington that he has to review the Summit's planned seating arrangement. Going to the parking lot, Reece opens a code-locked security compartment in the trunk of his SUV to reveal a firearm and several French license plates. He removes the license plate from the silver BMW and replaces it with one of the plates he has stowed away in his SUV. He then moves his SUV to another parking space and waits there, watching the silver BMW. He watches several men get into the vehicle, put a briefcase into its trunk, and drive away.Arriving home, Reece gets another call from the same source. Reece is in fact a CIA operative working in the Embassy as a cover. He does minor jobs for his superiors, and is eager to move up into Special Ops. His superior assures him he'll get his chance, but for now he is needed to secure a hidden transmission chip in the French Foreign Minister's office during a meeting with Ambassador Bennington. Reece doesn't believe he was given a chip, but is told it's in his left jacket pocket. Checking his jacket, he finds the chip there.Sitting in his apartment, Reece examines the chip. He is interrupted by a knock on his door. It's his girlfriend, Caroline (Kasia Smutnak) (pronounced Cah-roll-een'). Caroline kisses Reece and tells him she has a surprise. She sits him in a chair and makes him keep his back to her. He can hear her undressing and changing into a different outfit. When she tells him to look, his jaw drops at the sight of her wearing a sexy strapless dress. He thinks he recognizes the fabric, and Caroline tells him she made it out of their bedroom curtains-- Caroline is a clothing designer. The two of them quickly start to undress as they head into the bedroom to make out.Reece arrives the next day at the conference site to give Bennington a summary of what is intended to be discussed at the meeting. Bennington invites Reece to attend the meeting with him.During the meeting, Reece discreetly takes the chip (disguising it by putting a piece of gum in his mouth and offering another piece to the Minister's secretary) and tries to put it under the lampstand beside his seat, using his chewing gum as an adhesive. However, the gum fails to hold and twice it falls back to the floor in plain sight. Frustrated, and barely managing to keep the chip hidden, as a diversion Reece finally questions the Foreign Minister (Eric Godon) about his having several Goyas in his office. The Minister says he does, and offers to show them to Bennington, who is very interested in Goya art. As Bennington accompanies the Minister and secretary to see the Goyas, leaving Reece alone in the meeting room, Reece takes the stapler from the Minister's desk and staples the chip to the underside of the desk... but accidentally leaves the stapler open as he exits.Arriving home that evening, Reece is disquieted as the lights in the hallway go out. He finds what looks like a trail of blood leading to a door out onto the roof of the building. Grabbing a broom left in the hallway, he goes out to confront whoever left the trail. Caroline jumps, startled, and then chuckles sheepishly, remembering that she spilled a lot of tomato sauce from the take-out meal she's brought home for them to dine on out on the roof. Caroline kisses Reece and then says she has a gift for him. It's a jewelry box for a ring.They are again interrupted by another call from Reece's CIA superior. He's impressed at Reece's success in planting the mike in the Foreign Minister's office, and is giving him another task on very short notice. Reece is being assigned a partner, an American operative named Charlie Wax. Reece is not certified for special ops but he is assured that he will mostly be just driving Wax around. Wax is being held by French customs and Reece's first task is to get him through. He needs to head to the airport immediately. Reece is briefly hesitant, because this will ruin his evening with Caroline, but he is told that if he succeeds at this task, he has his foot in the door toward Special Ops.Caroline, who knows a few basics about Reece's line of work, is excited at hearing he's ready for promotion, and has him open the box. It's a beautiful pewter band that Caroline says belonged to her father. Reece realizes to his amazement that Caroline is proposing to him. She tells him that if she waited for him to do it, then their engagement would never happen. As she slips it onto his finger, Reece kisses the ring and then kisses Caroline, promising he'll never take the ring off.Arriving at airport customs, Reece is disturbed at the sight of Wax (John Travolta) arguing with the head customs agent. The customs officer speaking to Reece shows him Wax's passport, asking him to solve the issue before they lock Wax up. Customs is rigidly refusing to allow Wax to bring several cans of his favorite energy drink through Customs, sticking to a zero-tolerance policy on foreign liquids. Reece is frustrated at Wax's brazen attempt to push the customs officials' buttons by frequent use of the F-bomb and mocking France's relations with the United States.Reece takes Wax aside and tries to reason with him. Wax just shows him a card for a Chinese restaurant (Reece recognizes it and says the restaurant is only mediocre, but Wax says it's his destination), and says if Reece can't get him through, with his cans, he'll call the Embassy and ask for a different driver who will do things his way.Seeing that Wax and customs are at an immovable impasse, Reece finally slaps a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's duffel bag, thus rendering Wax's possessions legally exempt under international law from all customs actions. Wax chuckles smugly as Reece leads him away, past the fuming customs officials.Driving Wax toward the restaurant, Reece questions Wax on his attitude. Wax concedes that he is simply scornful of customs as being 'self-righteous' and that he can get an energy drink very similar to the cans he brought, in any French supermarket. What those drinks don't have, that his does, Wax says, is his 'secret ingredient.' He breaks the cans open to reveal the disassembled components of Wax's custom firearm. Reece is authorized to supply Wax with any firearm he desires, but as Wax says, nothing like his, a weapon he affectionately calls, 'Mrs. Jones.'Reece and Wax are at the Lotus des Neiges restaurant (Snowy Lotus in French), having dinner. Reece is trying to explain (much to Wax's amusement) how most ""Chinese food"" is actually American in origin, particularly Wax's seemingly favorite dish, egg foo yung. Wax calls a waiter over to verify Reece's claim that the Chinese word for egg is 'dan.' The waiter says he was born and raised in Belgium and doesn't speak Mandarin.Suddenly Wax slams the waiter's head down on the table and holds him at gunpoint, saying ""Let's talk dessert then, a Pakistani-Chinese dish."" The waiter is in shock and terror and completely confused. Wax suddenly clarifies, ""something you sniff off a spoon, buy by the kilo."" It's clear he suspects the restaurant as a front for cocaine distribution.At this point a huge shootout erupts, every employee of the restaurant turns out to be carrying firearms. Wax takes them all out in a scene that would make James Bond jealous-- all while keeping control of the lone waiter via his scarf. The restaurant cleared, Wax again pushes the waiter's head down on a table and demands to know where their 'blow' is. Despite Wax's continued insistence, the still-terrified waiter continues to insist there is none and the restaurant doesn't supply it.Wax slowly glances up at the ceiling, grabs an automatic firearm and fires a large number of rounds straight into the ceiling. Within seconds, a cascade of white powder is falling into the room from the room above. Wax tells Reece to empty a nearby vase and fill it with the cocaine. Wax also lets a bit of it fall on his fingers and tastes it, saying that it tastes pure enough that this restaurant's supply is only a step or two removed from the people who do the actual preparation of the drug. Wax finally tells the waiter that he is letting him go to deliver a message to his superiors: ""Wax on, Wax off.""Wax takes the keys to Reece's vehicle and hurries down the street, before finally turning and stopping in an area near the back of the restaurant (suggesting he knows the streets of Paris far better than ever alluded to), and explains his 'Wax on, Wax off' as a 'code' meaning that he (Wax) is going to take down the whole drug operation. From their current vantage point, they see the waiter running down the street. Wax follows him from a distance.As they follow the waiter, Reece questions Wax on carrying the cocaine-filled vase. Wax remarks that where they're going, it's better than cash. Reece wants assurance it's on 'official business' and Wax finally explains about a college-age woman named Charlotte who sniffed some of the drug at the restaurant and overdosed. This Charlotte is the niece of the U.S. Secretary of Defence, who has tasked Wax with shutting down the whole operation-- 'chef to chief.'They park in a back alley near the entrance to a nondescript warehouse/factory which the waiter ducks into. Reece notes a street gang nearby and recognizes them as 'Dragon Heads,' a seriously mean gang of Chinese-French people. Wax remains calmly unworried, correctly punching in the 'secret' code to Reece's hidden compartment in the rear of his SUV and handing Reece a .357 from inside it. He is in no rush despite the advance of the gang, acting like they are no problem, especially after the way he handled the restaurant staff (which were no mere 'kitchen staff' the way they were all packing heat, as Wax explains).When the leader of the gang pulls a switchblade on Wax, however, he springs into action, easily taking them all down without breaking a sweat. He and Reece enter the factory, stealthily making their way up a spiral staircase to the very top, where they encounter the kingpin of the Chinese operation, M. Wong (Bing Yin), who is with family and his closest friends watching their children doing a traditional Chinese dance performance. Wax discreetly presses his gun into the back of Wong's chair so he can feel the barrel, and Reece (who speaks Mandarin) translates as Wax tells Wong that he has an address book with every pimp, prostitute and dealer in Wong's network, and he will turn it over to French authorities and work with them in getting Wong deported from France unless he gives Wax the name and address of the man who delivers all his cocaine. Wax gives him half a minute to decide, but Reece, instead of translating this correctly, asks Wong to think of the children-- a subtle hint that Wax might harm them. Wong curtly and wordlessly writes down the address and hands the paper back to Wax.As Wax and Reece start to exit, a number of Wong's employees burst in, and Wong orders them to kill Wax and Reece. The two agents rush down the spiral staircase and through a double door into a part of the factory used for manufacturing clothing mannequins. Here another big shootout scene erupts in which Wax demonstrates more of his dazzling gunmanship, wiping all the thugs out. When the last one drops, Wax casually gestures with his head for him and Reece to leave.Later, Reece is on the phone with his superior, who is assuring him that he is moving up in the agency, on a mission given straight from the top. He also allays Reece's concerns about Wax, saying his playbook is unorthodox but he always gets the job done. When Reece still expresses concerns however (he's none too happy about carrying around a vase full of cocaine), his superior (a little curtly) tells him to stop thinking and just do whatever Wax tells him... and not to call again until the job is done.A moment after he hangs up, Caroline calls. Reece knows she is deeply concerned about his abruptly disappearing and not calling her in the meantime. He starts to try and explain to her, but suddenly his phone drops the call because of a low battery.Wax collects Reece and takes him for some coffee at the Eiffel Tower. Afterward, he sniffs a little of the cocaine and makes Reece do the same, so he will appear as a genuine user when they visit Mr. Wong's dealer. As the drug starts to take effect, Reece questions Wax on whether this is the same type of drug that killed Charlotte, the secretary of Defence's niece. Acting as though he doesn't understand how the point is lost on Reece, Wax tells him that 'Charlotte' was never a real person... the mission they are on is about taking down a Pakistani terrorist cell operating in Paris, using the cocaine to launder their funds before purchasing explosives that can strike anyone, anywhere, without warning.They make the meeting with the dealer, where Wax gets Reece to request a prostitute for Wax in a building up ahead. The dealer looks them up and down before signalling to one of the prostitutes to go with them. Wax hands Reece a couple of condoms and starts kissing the girl as they enter an elevator. Reece's frustration at Wax's methods-- and his own role in helping-- quickly fade into shock and horror as Caroline suddenly walks by carrying two rolls of clothing fabric, and spots them. The elevator door closes before Reece can try to extricate himself from the situation.Wax remains nonchalant as Reece grills him on the situation he's now in with his fiancee. He breaks into a room where another john is with his two girls, and orders them all out, but as the john tries to leave, Reece notes the man has a cell phone charger and force s him to hand it over, so Reece can charge up his cell phone and finally call Caroline. Wax tells him while he's busy with that, to come to the window and watch a bank on the corner where the terrorists do their money laundering. Reece watches the bank impatiently while Wax takes the hooker into the bathroom and starts making out with her.When Reece's phone is charged, he calls Caroline and tries to tell her that what she saw wasn't what it seemed-- she responds angrily that it seemed that her fiance was riding up an elevator with a hooker and her pimp. Reece desperately tells her that the man she saw wasn't a pimp, but Reece's partner that he had told her about before leaving. Caroline finally begs Reece to just come home, and he can bring this partner with him for dinner.The conversation is interrupted when men start pounding on the door. Emerging from the bathroom, Wax thinks it's the Pakistani pimp and tells Reece to shoot them. Reece has just enough time to say he doesn't want to kill anyone before two Pakistani men burst through the door and start giving him a beatdown. Wax, acting unconcerned, watches through the window as two men leave the bank carrying duffel bags. Finally he turns (very casually) and kills the two thugs, chastising Reece for not doing it himself.They follow the two runners down the street when Wax pauses to window-shop, much to Reece's shock. But again Wax is unconcerned, watching the two runners get into a van and using his watch to order a global satellite to track it. Using the satellite's tracking, Wax and Reece arrive in a very seedy part of the city; a run-down tenement area. Locating the correct building by which the van is parked, they approach some thugs standing outside it. They ask to be brought inside, saying they have cash to spend. The big thug looks them up and down and brings them inside, telling them to wait in the lobby while he gets Rashid. He also tells them not to look a particular youth in the eye.Wax wastes no time disobeying this request, looking the boy in the eye. The boy promptly pulls a gun and orders them to kneel down. Wax does so, making Reece do the same. The boy's gangmates start to divest them of their valuables, including Reece's ring. As Rashid (Chems Eddine Dahmani) enters, the boy gives the ring to Rashid, and he puts it on his finger.Rashid hands Wax a packet with five grams of cocaine, saying it will cost $50. Wax tastes a speck of it to determine its quality and says he'll buy an additional kilo. Rashid is incredulous at this, saying he doesn't sell in quantities that large. Reece explains that five grams is 'personal consumption,' a much lower grade of offence in Paris than a kilo, the dealing of which will land them 15 years in prison under French law. Wax then says aloud for all of the gang to hear, that it would be bad for them all to be caught with five kilos of their own product. Reece drops his vase, and it shatters on the ground and all the cocaine inside it spills all over the floor. All the gang members scatter and run, leaving Wax holding Rashid at gunpoint. Reece promptly jumps on Rashid and punches him out, taking back his ring. Wax eggs him on and then tells Rashid to take him to the senior members of the Pakistani cell.Rashid takes him to an apartment where Wax pushes his way in. He uses a scope to peer into the apartment directly below him and sees that terrorist operatives there are closing up shop. Directing Reece to go to the floor below and shoot anyone coming through the door of the apartment, Wax attaches a cable to the top of the window frame and rappels down to break into the lower-floor apartment through its window, promptly starting to take out all the terrorists in ways that all the other movie secret agents and action heroes can only dream about. As Reece gets in position, Wax warns him not to enter, noting the door is wired with heavy explosives-- the terrorists enter and leave through the apartment directly below on the 9th floor, connected to the rigged apartment through a pole (think Batpole without Batman). Wax uses the pole to go into the 9th floor apartment, picking up the gunfight from there, blowing away the last of the terrorists inside. Arriving on the 9th floor through the stairs, Reece confronts another operative, ordering him to get down on the floor. Instead, to Reece's horror, the man pulls Reece's gun right into his own mouth and makes Reece pull the trigger. Reece watches numbly as the man falls dead to the ground.Opening the apartment door, Wax commends Reece and then asks how many got out. Reece says maybe two or three, and Wax can't catch them now with their lead. Rushing to the window, Wax sees a getaway car ready to speed away. Doing some math calculations to estimate how long it will take the escaped operatives to reach the car, Wax spots several vests rigged with C-4 bricks for use by suicide bombers. Arming one vest, he takes it to the window and starts a countdown in his head. At the end of the countdown, he drops the vest outside the window. Just as the escaped operatives rush out the front door of the building and scramble into the car, the vest lands on the car and detonates from the impact, killing everyone inside the vehicle.Wax hastily grabs a number of items in the apartment and stuffs them into a duffel bag, ushering Reece out before the French police arrive. Reece takes the time to wash blood off his face at the washroom sink. As he finishes, Wax calls him into the next room. The room is covered with photographs of Reece. It's clear that many of the operatives in the terrorist cell have been following Reece and know a lot about him.They hear the sound of the police rushing in. Reece notes the police are rushing to the 10th floor door-- the one rigged to blow. He desperately tries to sprint forward to warn them, but Wax pulls him back, saying they are forced to let the police trigger the door in order to avoid detection and arrest. Insisting they're supposed to protect people instead of letting them die, Reece breaks free and rushes to warn the officers, but it's too late. They break the door down and many of them are killed in the resulting blast.Escaping the building with Reece, Wax jumps into an unmanned police car and drives off. They drive past Reece's SUV and Reece says he has to get his stuff from there. Wax says their arrival was expected and the vehicle was undoubtedly stripped by now. But Reece's prints are all over the car and the police will be able to trace it back to him. Wax throws the police car in reverse and slams into the cars parked right in front of Reece's SUV, knocking them back to jar Reece's vehicle and set off the booby trap linked to his hidden compartment. Reece's SUV is destroyed and Wax drives off with Reece.That evening, they meet with several senior CIA agents. Wax has Reece sit on a bench nearby and hands his colleagues the duffel bags filled with evidence from the terrorist apartments. They give him a brown paper bag in return, which turns out to contain one of Wax's indulgences-- quarter pounders with cheese (Royales with cheese, as they're called in France). Wax gives Reece one of the burgers and they talk as they eat. Reece admits he didn't actually kill the man that he confronted near the stairway, and Wax says he knew this, but Reece will still get credit. Wax thinks Reece makes a perfect partner for him... a remark that Reece has to grin at. Reece's cell phone alerts him at that moment to a text message from Caroline. She's told him that dinner awaits, and she's asking him to bring Wax with him.Reece and Wax arrive back at Reece's apartment for dinner. Also joining them is Caroline's best friend, a young Pakistani woman named Nichole (Amber Rose Revah), with whom Wax quickly develops a mutual fancy. As everyone is getting acquainted and Reece is telling Caroline about their day, Wax's phone rings. He goes near Reece's stereo and turns it up for privacy as he talks to his superiors. He is heard asking his superiors 'how many?' and then telling them to 'call them all back.'The four of them are just finishing dinner and enjoying light conversation over a bottle of wine when Nichole's cell phone rings. She tells the caller that nobody named Rose is present, and politely tells everyone at the table that it was a wrong number.But Wax's expression has turned very stern and serious. He tells Reece that it was not a wrong number-- in fact, it was the very call he was waiting for. Without another word he whips out his gun and, to the utter horror of both Reece and Caroline, Wax blows Nichole's head off her shoulders and kills her.Wax tells Reece that 'Rose' is a code word used by his superiors. Nichole answering a phone call by people looking for a 'Rose' means that Nichole's cell phone is part of a cell network used by the terrorist bloc. Worse still, Nichole being Caroline's best friend, Wax says, means Caroline is also involved-- in fact, it explains all the pictures of Reece in the terrorist apartments. Wax quickly locates and pulls out a hidden bug inside one of Reece's lamps, which means there are undoubtedly numerous other such devices in the apartment. Getting furious, Reece shouts that he thoroughly checked Caroline's credentials when he started dating her (much to her shock), but Wax has more proof in store... Reece's ring, given him by Caroline. Wax realizes that the terrorists are tracking their movements through the ring. Reece reluctantly gives Wax the ring over Caroline's tearful pleas, and Wax demonstrates that the ring interferes with the stereo; proof positive that it is a transmission device.A devastated Reece confronts Caroline. She offers him no more words, but instead pulls a hidden gun taped under a lampstand and shoots Reece in the shoulder. Laying down more gunfire to pin Wax down, Caroline leaps through the living room window. Wax follows and pursues her across several rooftops and down several fire escapes. But before Wax can catch up to her, a green Volvo roars into an intersection just ahead of Caroline with its passenger door open. She leaps in and pulls the door closed and the car roars off. Wax grabs his phone and gives his superiors the make, model, and license plate number of the Volvo.Later, agents have finished pulling over a dozen hidden microphones and several cameras out of Reece's apartment. Reece is dazed and confused. He realizes he didn't really know much about Caroline and is angry at himself. Wax tells him he was just in love. Wax himself has had relationships with women-- as he tells Reece, he's not made of stone.Reece's cell phone rings; it's Caroline. Quickly he and the other agents plug it into a laptop in order to trace the call. Caroline tells Reece she will be off the phone before they can finish a trace. Holding back tears, she tries to tell Reece that she never meant for him to be hurt. For a number of years she has known a man who has been a second father to her; a man who gave her a purpose in life; a cause to serve. A man who helped her make sense of things.Caroline hangs up, and she is seen going up to a bearded man (Farid Elouardi) and kissing his hand as he touches her face; on his finger is a ring exactly like the one Caroline gave Reece.A trace lock from the call is incomplete. Wax tells his agents to replay the call and turn the volume up, and from the background noises, Reece guesses the rough area in which Caroline placed the call as the Périphérique. Wax realizes Caroline and whoever she is with are heading out of Paris. At that moment, Reece gets a call from a very concerned Ambassador Bennington-- the American Delegation for the US-African Aid summit has just landed at the airport and Bennington expected Reece to be there to greet them. Wax determines that the Delegation's motorcade is going to be the target of a suicide bomb attack. Grabbing one of his colleagues as a driver, he rushes out to intercept them.As Wax and his driver race to save the Delegation, Reece paces about his apartment. He knows that there has to be more than just the bombing of the American Delegation; why use him, through Caroline? Why did they bug his apartment so thoroughly? He begins going through the house, and all of Caroline's things that are there. He goes through her clothing sketches and finds a piece of cut fabric, a newspaper with a front page devoted to the African Aid Summit... and a design sketch for a hooded outer garment like an Arabian hajib-- the same type of garment that he knows will be worn by mid-Eastern women delegates at the Summit.Reece calls Wax and warns him that the attack on the Delegation is a decoy. While the bearded driver goes to strike at them, Caroline is making her way to the actual Summit conference as a suicide bomber. Trying to line up a shot on the bearded driver's green Volvo with a portable rocket launcher provided him by his own driver, Wax tells Reece he can see Caroline in the passenger seat of the Volvo. Reece urges him to make direct visual contact. Wax gets his driver to move in closer, and he sees to his horror that Reece is right... in the passenger seat of the Volvo is a clothing mannequin. Wax calls the Delegation's security agent and warns them of danger, urging them to change course, but the Head of the Delegation (Alexandra Boyd) refuses to consent. Frustrated, Wax tells his driver to pull ahead of the bearded man and take him up to the bridge coming up ahead. Lining up his shot, he destroys the green Volvo a mere hundred yards in front of the Delegation's procession.Reece has made his way to the Embassy estate where the Summit conference is taking place. Wax calls him and tells him that Caroline will be wearing one of the shock-activated explosive vests like the one they found in the terrorist apartments, under her hajib. In order to save countless lives, Reece will need to shoot her in the head. Wax angrily insists Reece has to do this, over Reece's anguished protests.Reece uses his ID keycard at the security checkpoint but finds it denies him entry. The head of security (Nick Loren) informs him that the card has already been used by Ambassador Bennington's aide. Realizing that Caroline has his spare keycard, he tries to explain to security, but of course they respond with suspicion and try to forcibly lead him to the security office for questioning. Spotting Bennington, Reece urgently calls him over to verify his identity. But when Reece tries to walk through the metal detector, it immediately goes off, alerting security to Reece's gun, creating an even bigger problem. Even Bennington has no knowledge of Reece being authorized to carry firearms. Reece quietly tells Bennington that a suicide bomber is in the building. Caroline began dating and living with Reece to establish a cover for herself and ultimately give herself a means of entering the Summit conference. Bennington asks Reece if he's absolutely sure she's in the building, and Reece is forced to admit he isn't. Thinking quickly, Bennington asks Summit security to let Reece through. They say they will do so, but only if Reece is unarmed-- he cannot take his weapon. Bennington nods in agreement, and security lets go of Reece. The head of security discreetly follows behind him to watch him.Reece spots a woman wearing a hajib like the one in Caroline's sketch. He calls out to her; she half-turns and ducks into one of the conference rooms. Reece follows and sees the point behind Caroline's hajib-- it exactly matches those worn by all the other African and Mid-Eastern women delegates, making her indistinguishable from them, as they all have the hoods up.Following behind Reece, the head of security notes his agitation and quietly radios for backup, knowing a situation is about to start.Needing to pick Caroline out among the women delegates, Reece grabs a gun from one of the security officers and shouts in a loud voice for him not to move. He brandishes the gun so everyone in the room will see he has it. All the delegates and diplomats in the room begin to scatter or duck for cover. Reece's plan pays off as he sees one of the robed women's feet as she scurries away. She's wearing orange pumps: Caroline's shoes. He points his gun at her and orders her to freeze. Caroline complies, putting her hands up in the air, but she also is waiting to see if the security agents converging can disarm Reece. The agents repeatedly order him to drop his weapon, but refrain from opening fire as Reece is making no other threatening moves other than holding Caroline at gunpoint. Caroline finally turns to face Reece and slowly lowers her hood to reveal her face, and then she pulls her hajib open to reveal her explosive-laden vest. Instantly all the security agents' guns are turned to point at her. Reece shouts for them to hold fire, because the impact of the bullets will detonate her vest. Reece desperately tries to reason with Caroline, pleading to her that despite everything, he still loves her with all his heart, and that is all the 'sense' either of them will be able to make of anything that has transpired-- he still loves her. For a few instants it appears that Caroline is listening to Reece, but then her hand starts lifting up to tap the plate that will detonate her vest. Forced to react, Reece takes quick but careful aim and fires a shot right into Caroline's forehead. Arriving on the scene, Wax catches her falling body before it hits the floor, and disconnects the wires that charge her vest.Outside, the Head of the American Delegation is being required to remain seated in her car without an explanation, and she is getting angrier and more impatient by the minute. Her security agent recognizes Wax exiting the building and desperately asks him to explain to her. Wax gives a very vague story that a security problem has been handled and she is free to enter the Summit. The Head of the Delegation marches up to Bennington and curtly (and rudely) demands that the person or persons responsible for the delay be identified and fired.Reece is bringing Wax to the airport to return to the United States. He gives Wax a cheeseburger as a going-away present. Wax laughs appreciatively and tells Reece that his performance and heroics have almost assuredly earned him a big promotion that will more than likely take him on the road; though as Wax adds, he would certainly love it if Reece came with him. Reece wants to get back to his apartment, having a lot of things to take care of. Wax tells him that his apartment has already been 'packed up and shipped out,' but Wax has what he believes Reece wants-- a strip of photographs that Reece and Caroline posed for at a street-side automatic photo booth, the only memento Reece will have to remember Caroline by.The movie closes with Wax revealing that he is also a chess player, and invites Reece to play a game with him before Wax leaves. The camera pans out gradually as they set up the board and pieces, along with a good-natured trading of 'smack talk.'"
The Losers,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480255/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A CIA special forces team is betrayed and left for dead by their superiors, galvanizing them to mount an offensive on the CIA. A tale of double cross and revenge, centered upon the members of an elite U.S. Special Forces unit sent into the Bolivian jungle on a search and destroy mission. The team-Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch and Cougar -find themselves the target of a lethal betrayal instigated from inside by a powerful enemy known only as Max. Presumed dead, the group makes plans to even the score when they're joined by the mysterious Aisha, a beautiful operative with her own agenda. Working together, they must remain deep undercover while tracking the heavily-guarded Max, a ruthless man bent on embroiling the world in a new high-tech global war.—Warner Bros. Pictures Clay, Jensen, Pooch, and Roque are part of United States Special Forces Unit. They are deployed to a mission in Bolivia involving a drug lord, they end up disobeying orders and rescuing children. Their enraged boss, codenamed Max, orders them dead, but they survive, and end up doing small-time jobs. Then Aisha enters their lives, smuggles them back to the States on the condition that they kill Max. The group will soon realize that she has inducted them on a suicide mission - a mission which will take them to Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and to Mumbai, India; and come in possession of a mysterious encrypted hard-drive while not only facing betrayal from one of their own but also certain and violent death at the hands of Max.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) For the US military, Colonel Clay leads a black ops elite commando unit of five consisting of himself, Jensen (communications and tech), Cougar (long range weapons), Pooch (transportation and heavy weapons) and Roque (demolitions and tactical). On their latest mission to take out Fadhil, a drug lord and arms dealer hiding out in the jungles of Bolivia, they discover after the fact in the tragic way the mission ended that they were not supposed to make it out alive, and that they will be blamed for the tragedy that occurred. As such, they decide to plant evidence as to they having perished as was the plan by whoever was pulling the strings while they figure out what to do hopefully to get their lives back. They are certain the person who pulled those strings for their planned deaths was the unknown man with who they were communicating during the operation, he code named Max. Clay is approached by a young woman, Aisha, who offers him and them a deal: she will be their backer, which includes getting them back to the United States which they are currently unable to do with no money and no identification, in exchange for them finding and killing Max, she up front in framing the offer as a probable suicide mission. Although suspicious as he/they know nothing about her, they accept her offer. As they try not only to find Max but also find why he wanted them dead in the process, Clay and the team may face some internal obstacles in diverging priorities among them, especially as some may believe Clay's judgment is clouded by the offer being from a beautiful woman, he being a ladies man which has gotten him and them into trouble in the past.—Huggo The Losers are an elite black-ops team of United States Special Forces operatives, led by Lt. Col. Franklin Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) - Operational Control. The rest of the team consists of Capt. William Roque (Idris Elba) - Demo And Tactical; Sgt. Linwood ""Pooch"" Porteous (Columbus Short), - Transport And Heavy Weapons; Capt. Jake Jensen (Chris Evans) - Comms And Tech; and Sgt. Carlos ""Cougar"" Alvarez (Óscar Jaenada) - Long-Range Eliminations, who are sent to Bolivia in a search-and-destroy mission against a compound run by a drug lord named Fadhil (Peter Francis James).While laser ""painting"" the target for an air strike, the Losers spot a busload of school children arriving at the compound. The children are being used as drug mules. Clay tries to get their mission coordinator back in Washington, D.C., a man they know only by voice and code name, ""Max"" (Jason Patric), to call off the attack, but Max ignores Clay's pleas and orders them to proceed. Clay then orders the laser guidance system destroyed and informs Max that they've experienced irreparable damage to their guidance equipment and the attack will have to be canceled. Max informs them that the coordinates had already been locked in, so the jet pilot still knew where to go, and he was not going to withdraw his order to attack under any circumstances. Finally, the Losers attempt to contact the jet pilot directly, but the communications system on the aircraft had been locked out.Having no other option, and with only 8 minutes until the jet was due to arrive, the Losers decide to enter the compound and attempt to rescue the children. They come racing into the compound in their Hummer, guns blazing, shooting guards left and right, high and low. Their vehicle is destroyed but they manage to get 24 of the 25 children and hustle them back into the school bus. The final child, a young boy, was being held hostage by the drug lord and owner of the compound, Fadhil (Peter Francis James). After convincing Fadhil to release the boy, Clay is forced to shoot Fadhil when he makes a threatening move. He and the boy then join the others on the bus.The Losers and the children speed as fast as that bus will carry them, hurrying to get out of the kill zone of the aerial ordnance about to be released from the jet. The shock wave of the explosions drive them off the road and down a slope where they come to an abrupt stop. Everyone is okay. They call for a helicopter to come execute their pre-planned extraction. The load-master of the helicopter informs the colonel that they can't take both the team and the children, so the colonel tells him to take the children. Once the children are aboard and the helicopter takes off, the team hears the sound of an approaching jet. They watch in horror as the jet releases an air-to-air missile which destroys the helicopter and instantly kills all aboard.Knowing that the attack was meant to kill them, the Losers fake their deaths by tossing their dog tags into the fire of the crashed helicopter. They attempt to find their way out of Bolivia and back to the United States where the death of the 25 Bolivian children is a scandal. The government blames the children's deaths on The Losers by saying they were acting without sanction as rogue agents. The government claims The Losers are dead but refuse their families a military ceremony or funeral service.Roque is frustrated in his attempts to convince Clay to accept the fact that his life as a soldier is forever over, and that he has no hope of ever finding out who Max is, much less killing him, which Clay very much wants to do.Four months later, Clay finds himself being observed and followed by Aisha al-Fadhil (Zoe Saldana), a mysterious woman who proves to possess many unique capabilities. She at first seduces Clay, then tries to kill him in hand-to-hand combat. As they achieve a stand-off in their fight, Aisha offers Clay the chance to find and kill Max, against whom she also wants revenge, but she doesn't say why. She tells him she can provide all of the information, weapons and other items the team will need, including a way to get back into the U.S., undetected. Clay really doesn't have any other options, so he accepts the offer.Aisha then arranges for the Losers to return to the United States (New Mexico), smuggling them inside coffins. The team is completely outfitted with weapons, gear, and some information about Max and how he moves around. They hijack a military helicopter after using a military radio to call in a fake accident between a military vehicle (theirs) and a semi-truck on a remote road. They use a shoulder-fired missile to send the helicopter's GPS transponder way off into another area code, then fly the helicopter to a warehouse and give it a new coat of paint.We first meet Max when he is in Dubai attempting to force a deal with some Indian engineers or government officials for seismic nukes (""Snukes""), weapons that can cause an entire area to implode on itself, but without any radioactive fall-out. A Snuke was successfully tested when it was detonated on a small island and the island imploded and disappeared. The main official Max had been dealing with was having second thoughts and now just wanted Max to go away and keep his money. Max responds by having his henchman Wade Travis (Holt McCallany) throw the man off a roof. Max pretends that he hadn't meant for Wade to do more than punch the man around a bit, but that was just to show the others there that Wade was unpredictable and someone not to trifle with. One of the other men present promptly decided that they would be more than willing and able to work with Max in acquiring some Snukes.The team learns that Max often travels in a heavily guarded, multi-vehicle convoy, with himself situated inside an armored truck. They develop plans to intercept the convoy and kidnap Max. Clay and Roque direct the attack from their command vehicle, a beat up yellow Pinto. As the convoy moves quickly down a busy city street, Cougar shoots the wheels of the lead vehicle, causing it to crash and block further movement. The convoy stops and the guards exit the vehicles and form a perimeter. Clay steps from behind the wheel of the Pinto and fires a gas grenade into their midst, then Roque detonates an explosive device he had earlier attached to the fender of one of the convoy vehicles, blowing it high into the air.Pooch and Aisha then swoop in with the newly painted and outfitted military chopper, carrying a huge magnet that they attach to the top of Max's armored truck. Jensen, working from the sidewalk, and disguised as a hot dog vendor, fires a metal device that secures the back doors of the armored truck, preventing the occupants from getting out. As the helicopter lifts and carries away the armored truck, Wade grabs the controls of a .50 caliber machine gun and tries to bring down the chopper. He hits it, but Pooch is able to maintain control and fly out of range.When The Losers later open the armored vehicle at their remote warehouse, there are three security guards who come out, pointing their weapons. The guards know nothing about anyone named Max, and an inspection of the truck proves Max is not there. The guards prove to have been escorting only a small box containing an external computer hard drive, made by the ""Goliath"" mega firm. After the security guards are disabled with sleeper darts, the team becomes furious with Aisha for double-crossing them. Tempers flare and Aisha is nearly killed on the spot by Roque. Even after she tells them she could explain, and that they could still eventually find Max, Clay orders Roque to kill her, burn everything, and get away. Aisha hurriedly explains that the hard drive contains information that is critical to whatever it is Max is doing at the time, and if they can determine what that information is, they will likely be able to find Max and clear their names. Clay decides to postpone her execution.Capt. Jensen attempts to read the hard drive, but it's encrypted. He says it would require access to a Goliath system computer to be able to read what's on the drive. So, the team works up a plan to infiltrate the company that made the drive. Jensen poses as an in-house computer tech and manages to gain temporary access to one of the human resource manager's computers at Goliath. He does that by pretending to be a pizza delivery boy, quickly changing his clothes in the elevator (impressing some women who see him when the doors open once before arriving at his floor), then enters the office of the human resources representative whom he'd called to report someone exposing themselves on the main floor. He tells the human resources secretary that he was just going to quickly 'upgrade the firewall'.Jensen downloads the encryption key Goliath uses, but is soon confronted by an armed security guard, who was called by the secretary. Jensen knocks that guard down and runs, calling on his radio for advice on how best to escape the building. He's told to head to the north side exterior elevator lobby. He's trapped there by three more security guards, but after a stand off, where Jensen pretends to have invisible handguns he's pointing at the guards, two of the guards go down, shot by Cougar, who fired from a skyscraper a long distance away. The third guard voluntarily lays down on his stomach, as Jensen ordered him to do, and Jensen gets away.Back at the base, they find out that the hard drive is a kind of electronic credit card that holds all of Max's illicit funds, $400 million at the time, which he received for selling the Snukes to international terrorists. A list of frequent IP addresses are listed, including one that had been used frequently and which was traced to the Los Angeles International Port Of Entry. Jensen determines that all but $4 million of the $400 million could be directly traced. He was trying to sort out that last amount.Clay and Aisha leave the boys to it and hop back into bed together. Aisha keeps up with questions she had been asking about Fadhil, back in Bolivia.Jensen later reads more of what he finds on the hard drive. It notes that the Losers mission in Bolivia was a cover, so Max could steal Fadhil's drug money. Furthermore, he was able to locate the destination of that missing $4 million. It was paid to the daughter of the drug lord, Fadhil, a woman named Aisha. As he was reading that last tidbit, everyone on the team drew their weapons and pointed them at Aisha, while at the same time she drew two handguns and pointed the guns at two of them. Jensen didn't have his gun, but he was mostly concerned that Aisha was pointing her gun at his ""junk."" He said it didn't help when she repositioned the gun and pointed it at his head instead.It turns out that Aisha had needed the Losers to help her take revenge for her father and reclaim the money Max stole from him (she apparently didn't know her father was a drug lord). When she learned from Clay, during their pillow talk, that he and his team had targeted the compound for a hit, then called off the hit to rescue some children, and that Fadhil had been killed during their attack, she began to wonder if it was Clay that had killed her father.To end the stand-off, Aisha decides to shoot Jensen in his left shoulder and then runs into the bathroom of the hotel suite they were in, taking refuge in the bathtub as the team shredded the bathroom with gunfire. She is nevertheless able to make her escape out a window. Believing that she might betray them, the colonel gives the team members orders to go home and protect their family members, whose identities were known to Aisha. Each of the Losers in turn decide that they will continue on and help the colonel try to take down Max.The Losers break into a supermarket to get some items to patch up Jensen with, then continue to go ahead with the mission to take out Max, hoping to find some information on the servers at the pier to clear their names. The team get into action and plan their attack.Meanwhile, the Indian engineers have regained some of their bravado to challenge Max and they demand $1 billion in exchange for providing Max with some Snukes. Max, as always, doesn't demonstrably react to something that probably made him inwardly furious. Instead, he agrees to the demand and determines he can get the money from the CIA's coffers somehow.The Losers proceed with their attack on Max's base. Cougar takes out a sentry who had spotted Jensen as he was scaling the pier hanger building. Once safely inside, Jensen opens the doors for Clay and Roque, then heads for the main computer room. When Roque opens the door to a large container sitting on the pier and calls Clay over to have a look, Clay observes large pallets of U.S. currency and immediately suspects something is not right, that something had changed from what they expected to be happening. As he moves in for a closer look, Roque clubs him from behind, knocking him unconscious.When Clay regains consciousness, Max and Travis are making arrangements to exchange that container full of money for four of the so-called Snukes, and a Ducati motorcycle, situated within another container. However, Max suddenly changes the terms of the deal and tells the Indian engineers that he'll be keeping both the money and the Snukes. Further, in return for not killing them, they must arm the first Snuke. The engineer who arms the Snuke is shot in the head anyway. Max maintains control of a handheld pressure detonating device, set to less than 10 seconds.Clay witnesses the rest of his team members now in custody, all captured based on the information provided by Roque. He learns of Max's plan to frame him and his team for a major theft of CIA money. As Clay is being driven away in a car, Cougar, Pooch, and Jensen are being lined up to be executed. Pooch resists and refuses to get down on his knees as ordered, so one of the captors shoots him in both knees. Cougar is resisting allowing his hat to be removed and, as he is about to be shot in head, the shooter is distracted by Cougar's eyes, which are focused up and behind the shooter. As the shooter turns to look, he sees Aisha fire an RPG that explodes nearby.Cougar, Pooch, and Jensen fight against their captors, while Clay knocks out his captors in the car, forcing it to crash, and he escapes with a gun.In the heat of the ensuing battle, Aisha gets the drop on Clay and forces him to admit that it was he who killed Aisha's father. He tells her he wouldn't blame her if she shot him dead right then. Instead, she decides that they need everyone available to continue dealing with Max and his men, but she promises Clay that they would deal with the matter later.Roque supervises the loading of the money on Max's jet plane, but as the Losers are gaining the upper hand in the battle around him, he decides to try and escape with the money. First, he has to deal with Clay, who has managed to reach the jet and engaged Roque in a brutal fight. Roque is very good with knives and wounds Clay, eventually knocking Clay out of the jet and onto the pier. But Clay gouged Roque's right eye closed, maybe even out, before he was ejected from the plane.Roque orders to pilot to taxi to the end of the pier, turn around and take off. As Roque's jet heads down the pier, Wade had boarded the Ducati motorcycle and was attempting to intercept and stop the jet. Clay, meanwhile, was just coming to his senses on the pier, only to find the jet bearing down on him from one side, and Wade on the motorcycle from the other. He calmly speaks into a wireless earphone for Cougar to take the shot.Cougar is perched atop a container, suspended from a large dockside crane, and he sights and shoots at the motorcycle, hitting the gasoline tank and causing an explosion which hurls Wade forward into the jet's left engine. The engine jams and catches fire, while the flaming motorcycle crashes into the cockpit of the plane, exploding and killing Roque and the pilot. Burning money rains down on Clay, who had safely dived out of the way.As Jensen, Cougar and Aisha help the wounded Pooch, Clay spots Max climbing the stairs of a crane. Max is calling out on his radio for his helicopter pilot to come rescue him. Clay chases Max up to the top deck of the crane and gets the drop on Max. Max's rescue ride arrives, but decides to take off as Clay fires off a burst of automatic weapon fire at it. Max responds by revealing that he's holding a hand-held pressure detonating device to the armed Snuke. If he releases his grip on the device, the bomb will detonate within 8 seconds and basically take out Los Angeles.Clay shoots Max in the shoulder. Max is driven back and complains that the bullet really hurt, but he still had pressure on the device in his hand. Max then decides to get rid of the device and he flings it out towards the water. Clay doesn't hesitate even a second as he launches his body off the crane and dives after the device. He hits the water maybe a second after the device does and is able to grab it and reapply pressure to the trigger. Once he's back on the dock, he's given a roll of duct tape to use in securing the trigger.A phone in possession of the team rings and Clay is told the caller wishes to speak to him. It's Max, calling from aboard a bus somewhere in Los Angeles. He doesn't have much to say, just wishing that he and Clay could have found a way to work together. Clay tells Max that now that he knows what he looks like, he'd be seeing him soon. Max is approached on the bus by two big and mean-looking Latino men. When one of them tells him he's wearing a nice looking watch, Max just holds his arm out so the guy can remove it.The Losers help Pooch gain access into the hospital for the birth of his child, a healthy baby boy, blaming traffic for his delay in getting there. Later, they attend Jensen's 8-year old niece's soccer match, where Jensen picks a fight with a very butch female referee."
Faster,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433108/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An ex-con gets on a series of apparently unrelated killings. He gets tracked by a veteran cop with secrets of his own and an egocentric hit man. A lone man, recently released from prison, seeks out the people from his past who he believes betrayed him. While he forces each to atone for their sins, he must also face what meting out vengeance will do to his immortal soul. Meanwhile, he's not the only one looking to settle old scores: hired by the man responsible for the events which led him to prison, an eccentric contract killer follows his every move. Scenes of them crossing paths, sometimes violently, are interspersed with the assassin's self-realizations of how to deal with struggles within his own life. As if old enemies and hired guns aren't enough, a young female detective begrudgingly works alongside a veteran investigator looking to simply survive his last two weeks on the force before retirement, as they seek out the brazen ex-con who has been blazing a path of gasoline-powered destruction in his vintage Chevelle.—ahmetkozan On leaving prison James ""Jimmy"" Cullen (Dwayne Johnson) retrieves his 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle, a gun, and a list of names before heading to an telemarketing office in Bakersfield, California and killing a man named Prescott Ashton (Courtney Gains).
He then visits Roy Grone (Mike Epps), who gave him the car and gun, and forces him to give him more names. Meanwhile, Cullen is tracked by detectives Cicero (Carla Gugino) and Humphries (Billy Bob Thornton); a hit-man known as ""Killer"" (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is also hired to kill Cullen.
Humphries is shown to be a desperate heroin addict, who doesn't even have the money to cover a single hit. Humphries is just a couple of weeks away from retirement. Cicero is a competent officer and hates Humphries. Retirement means full pension and benefits for Humphries and his family.
Cicero figures out from the office CCTV video that Prescott knew the man who killed him.Cullen locates the second person on his list, Kenneth Tyson (John Cirigliano), who films his own personal snuff films. After finding and killing Tyson, Cullen gets into a gunfight with Killer in the hallway but manages to escape.
This affects Killer philosophically, and, after proposing marriage to his girlfriend, Lily (Maggie Grace), begins to take the task personally. Killer is shown to be a perfectionist. He has polio as a kid, but then took control of his life, got surgery in his legs, and conquered every physical challenge thrown at him. He has never failed at anything that he has set his mind to.
The killer is obsessed that Cullen was faster than him and he had no fear.Humphries and Cicero investigate Cullen's past and discover he was double-crossed during a robbery. Cullen was the driver, and Gary was in the crew. Cullen was great at driving and is able to escape with the crew. But then the bank robbery crew was ambushed by another crew. It was a setup, and the snuff event was filmed on camera.
Cicero remembers him from a video of his older half-brother Gary's (Matt Gerald) death filmed by Tyson, which depicts an unidentified man shooting Cullen in the head; he narrowly survives, and has a metal plate surgically implanted in his skull. The killer's faces were never seen in the video and hence the case was closed.
Cicero deduces that Cullen is going after everyone in that video.Cullen visits his former girlfriend, Nan Porterman (Jennifer Carpenter) who knows he is killing those involved from the video of Gary's death. After revealing that she aborted their unborn child and has begun a new life by having a family, she wishes him well.
At a strip club in Nevada, Cullen stabs bouncer Hovis Nixon (Lester Speight) for his role in Gary's death, but he manages to survive. Soon, both Humphries and Killer get word that Nixon is in the hospital. Knowing Cullen will go back to finish him off, they converge there.Cullen enters the hospital and kills Nixon while he is in surgery. Humphries attempts to unsuccessfully bring down Cullen but is spared when the latter sees his badge.
While driving away from the hospital, Cullen encounters Killer where they get into a high-speed chase on the freeway, culminating in Killer shooting Cullen in the neck.
Killer receives a call from his handler that the client wants to pull the job, but Killer refuses to relent.Cullen goes to his mother to get his neck wound stitched.
Eventually Cullen comes to believe that his father arranged to have him, and Gary killed after they refused to share the money that they stole in that bank robbery. However, Cullen finds out that his father died 3-4 years before.
Mrs. Cullen (Annie Corley) says that Cullen's father was not capable of killing his own son Gary. Mr Cullen was cruel to Cullen, as he knew that Cullen was born out of wedlock, when Mrs Cullen cheated on him. Cullen sees a family photo that focuses on Gary's girlfriend, and it is shown that Gary's girlfriend is now Humphries' wife.The last man on his list is a traveling evangelist named Alexander Jerrod (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); after concluding his service, he is confronted by Cullen, but is spared after revealing that he has turned his life around and begging for forgiveness. Cullen is then confronted by Killer. Killer says that Cullen is not done, as there is still the one who hired him.Cicero eventually learns the true identity of the man who shot Cullen. She finds all the victims were police informants who never did any serious prison time. Their cases were dealt by Humphries.She hurries to the church where Humphries is already on the scene. As Killer and Cullen confront each other, Humphries walks in and shoots Cullen in the head, revealing it was he who shot him in the video. He offers Killer the money for completing the job, but Killer declines, telling Humphries to never contact him again.Humphries calls his wife, Marina (Moon Bloodgood), who is revealed to have been his informant, while she was still Gary's girlfriend. Suddenly, he is shot and killed by Cullen, who survived due to his metal plate. Cicero arrives on the scene after Cullen leaves, and she covers up Humphries' involvement.Cullen scatters Gary's ashes in the sea and drives off into the sunset, while Killer returns home to Lily; simultaneously, Jerrod begins a sermon on forgiveness."

Skyline,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1564585/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Strange lights descend on the city of Los Angeles, drawing people outside like moths to a flame where an extraterrestrial force threatens to swallow the entire human population off the face of the Earth. Jarrod and his pregnant girlfriend Elaine travel to Los Angeles to meet his old friend and successful entrepreneur Terry, and his wife Candice. Terry gives a party in his apartment for Jarrod and offers a job position to him in LA. Terry's assistant and lover Denise (Crystal Reed) and his friend Ray (Neil Hopkins) sleep on the couch in the living room, but in the dawn of the next morning, the group is awakened by mysterious beams of blue light. Ray stares at the light and is taken by the mysterious force. The group of friends try to escape from the alien invaders.—Claudio Carvalho, RIo de Janeiro, Brazil As the film opens we see falling blue lights, like flares, raining down on Los Angeles at night time, evenly spaced over the terrain. Then we see young couple Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and Elaine (Scottie Thompson) being woken by blue lights outside the window shining through the slates in the blinds. Elaine thinks it is morning, and she gets up and goes to the bathroom to throw up. When she returns to bed the room starts shaking and Jarrod goes to the window to lift the blinds and find out what the ruckus is. An anguished shout from the next room stops him, and Jarrod goes out to find Denise (Crystal Reed) crying that the lights took Ray (Neil Hopkins). The blinds are up here, and the door is open, and as Jarrod looks at the blue light shining in the room blue/black veins start to grow all over his eyes, cheekbones and shoulders, and his eyes go mottled-opaque. Terry (Donald Faison) and Candice (Brittany Daniel) are also woken, and go into the living room where the lights are. Jarrod starts to move mindlessly towards the light.15 hours earlier. Jarrod and Elaine arrive by plane from New York to visit Terry, who is a childhood friend of Jarrod and is now doing extremely well for himself by working for a special effects company, for his birthday. Terry has them met at the airport by a limo and once they arrive at the apartment Terry shows them their room, introduces them to Candice, his girlfriend and Denise his PA (personal assistant), shows them around, and they go to the building swimming pool to party and get drunk. Elaine, Candice and Denise look on at their men getting drunk and acting crazy like two overgrown teenagers. They notice Homeland Security helicopters flying over their building and across the nearby marina. Terry checks the news on his portable iPad but it appears there is nothing out of the ordinary.That evening, everyone celebrates Terry's birthday by holding a big party at his penthouse apartment. At one point the building manager, Oliver (David Zayas), comes and asks them to keep the noise down as there have been complaints.Ray, a business associate of Terry's, lets the cat out of the bag that Terry wants Jarrod to move to Los Angeles and work with him, doing visual effects. Jarrod does not seem keen but Elaine is angry and upset. Later on, she tells Jarrod that she is pregnant, upsetting him; he says that he is not ready for that and she agrees. After they make up, Jarrod and Elaine find out that Terry is cheating on Candice with Denise. Elaine wants to tell Candice, but Jarrod, wanting to protect his friend, tells her to stay silent.Day 1: 4:27 a.m. Opening where the movie began, we see the blue lights falling from the sky, one of them landing in the courtyard outside the high-rise apartment building, and Ray being taken, this time from Denise's point of view. After they drag Jarrod away from the lights the veins go away, although that's clearly a painful process, and he can't see properly while it's dissipating. Then, the blue flares take off back into the night sky.Terry and Jarrod go up to the roof to see what is going on. Terry takes his revolver and Jarrod takes his camera. They meet Terry's elderly neighbor Walt (Robin Gammell) in the hall with his dog, and tell him to return to his apartment. Back in the apartment, the ladies try to find information to what is going on, but all the TV channels have no signal, and all news stations show empty studio sets. Elaine tries calling her mother in New York, but only gets her voice mail.On the roof, Jarrod lets the security door close behind him so the guys are trapped on the roof. It is dawn, and they see huge clouds rolling in to Los Angeles, with flickers of blue lightning, and the blue flare lights return back to the ground. Then, descending from the clouds is an armada of large alien spaceships of various shapes and sizes, all over the city. The spaceships suck up clouds of dust, and Jarrod uses his Canon EOS camera to shoot pics; they realize the 'clouds' are actually thousands of screaming humans being sucked into each ship by a vacuum in the blue lights. Then they see dozens of smaller flying alien drones emerging from the ships and flying all over the city. A flying alien drone appears over the edge of the roof and the guys are nearly caught by it's ray-like blue light. Terry shoots the door handle so they can get back into the building, to no avail, but Elaine arrives and opens it from the inside and saves the guys. Elaine looks in the blue light from the flying drone alien and gets veiny, but Jarrod carries her back to the apartment with Terry.Everyone looks at the images and is horrified. Candice looks at the rest of the images on the camera, and someone has taken shots of Terry and Denise having sex. She is pissed off, but stays silent.Looking through the telescope, the crew sees that there are no lights, ships or aliens over the ocean. Terry's plan is to drive to the marina, get in his boat, and get away from the city. Elaine tries to persuade everyone to stay in the apartment and wait until someone comes, but she soon relents and agrees to go with Terry's plan.Terry goes to Walt's apartment to get his keys so they can have two cars. While talking to Walt, a flying alien drone hovers outside the window and sends tentacles in to search the room. Walt's persistently barking dog gives Walt and Terry away, and Walt (and the dog) are grabbed and sucked up by the flying drone. Terry gets away, with the Mercedes keys. He gets the others from his apartment and they all take the elevator to the underground parking garage.Terry and Denise take Terry's Ferrari, while Candice drives Elaine and Jarrod in Walt's Merc. On the way out they meet a bickering couple, Colin (J. Paul Boehmer) and Jen (Tanya Newbould), packing their car and also attempting to flee the building. Terry leaves the car park first, but the car crushed by a stomping alien standing over 20-feet tall. Denise is killed, but Terry falls out of the car and tries to get away, ineffectively shooting the ""stompy"" tanker alien with his weapon. Jarrod leaps out and pulls Terry to safety, but the stomping tanker shoots out a long multi-tongued appendage and sucks Terry back to it's grasping claws and seemingly consumes/eats him. Elaine pulls Jarrod back in to the car, and Candice backs it up while stomping alien tries to get in to the car park. While fleeing back into the garage they encounter a multi-blue eyed, squid-like alien life form (resembling a cross between the aliens in 'Independence Day' and the bio-mechanical flying robots from the 'Matrix' movies). It takes Colin into its tentacles after paralyzing him with its own blue light. It corners the rest of the group and affects Jarrod with its blue light. Then suddenly the building manager, Oliver, slams into it with an SUV. Oliver and Jen pull Colin out covered in black goo and gasping for air. However the squid alien is not dead, and a tentacle sucks onto Colin's head and pulls out his brain, brain stem, and part of his spinal column and puts the brain into its own head... as if recharging itself with the human brain like a new battery. Oliver has the keys to the building so he hurriedly opens an internal security door and the rest escape through it.The group runs out of the garage and past the swimming pool, making for the back gate entrance of the building. But the two-legged alien stomper ambushes them, shooting three sticky tongue-things at them and stomping everywhere. He snags Jen and engulfs her. The rest discover a second stomping tanker heading from the other side of the building. Trapped between the two alien tankers, Oliver breaks a glass door and they head back inside and climb back up the fire stairs to Terry's apartment to regroup.The trembling and immature Jarrod is upset that he let Terry go and didn't save him. Elaine is upset that no one listened to her and they made a pointless effort to escape from the building that cost lives. Candice takes the time to light herself a cigarette, but Elaine asks Candice not to smoke, because she is pregnant. Elaine is worried that the veiny-thing blue-light has permanently affected their bodies and what that might do to her baby. Jarrod pulls up his shirt and sees that he has veiny-things on his abdomen that aren't going away. Oliver and Jarrod barricade the front door and keep watch while the women sleep. They hang out there a for the rest of the day. That evening, through the telescope, the crew see the military begin to fight back in the streets with tanker and hydra aliens. A few hours later, the water is cut off.The next morning (Day 2), the four survivors (Jarrod, Elaine, Oliver, and Candice) debate over what to do next. Jarrod wants to make another attempt to get to the marina to find Terry's motorboat to escape. Oliver is against this as is Elaine and Candice, reminding him that even if they did get to the boat and escape from Los Angeles, they ask Jarrod where would they go for they must consider that this alien invasion is happening all over the world since there has been no news on the TV, radio, or Internet since yesterday morning. Jarrod stubbornly doesn't seem to care and just wants to get out of the building and away from there... despite no plan at how to get away or where to go.The group's debate is interrupted when they hear the sound of flying jets overhead. Looking out of the window, with Oliver manning the telescope and the rest watching on the flat-screen TV set, they see that all of the other alien ships have departed, save for one big one hovering over downtown L.A. The US Air Force has launched a counter-attack against the aliens. They watch a large squadron of several dozen unmanned Predator drones, armed with air-to-air sidewinder missiles, escorting a handful of unmanned Stealth bomber drones, flying towards the large hovering alien spaceship which is presumably the mother ship. Hundreds of alien drones fly out of the alien ship and engage the Predator and Stealth drones in a huge aerial battle (resembling hornets or wasps protecting their hive from a enemy swarm of other insects). Many Predator, Stealth and alien drones are destroyed; the group notices that the flying alien 'Matrix-esq' drones do not appear to have any weapons such as laser cannons or missiles, but they seem to crash themselves into the unmanned aircraft with little or no regard for their own well being.Most of the Predator drones and Stealth bomber drones are destroyed in the dogfight, until a single surviving Stealth bomber gets through the carnage and fires a missile at the alien ship before it is destroyed as well. The missile hits and explodes inside the large alien ship.... in a massive nuclear explosion, creating a massive shock wave. Out of the mushroom cloud, the alien ship is blown apart and crashes into the ground. Everyone hugs and laughs with joy at the burning hulk. Then... looking through the telescope, Jarrod sees the ruins of the ship as it glows with a blue light. Thousands of drone, tanker, and squid aliens crawl out and begin to swarm all over the city. As the smoke from the mushroom cloud clears, the group watches with disbelief as the alien spaceship slowly rises back into the air and all of the broken-off pieces rise with it and slowly re-attach themselves... self-regenerating. A couple of the blinds fall down and Oliver and Candice tape up sheets over the windows with duct tape so the blue lights from the alien ship will not affect them.Then, the group see a military helicopter deposit soldiers on a nearby building rooftop. Jarrod decides to take Elaine and go to the roof and get rescued by the military. Oliver tries to stop them but Jarrod gets very violent and veiny: he says he feels powerful from the light, and he will not leave without his family. Elaine says she trusts him, and they leave.Candice sees the blue light of the large regenerating ship through the telescope and goes veiny. She opens the door and walks out and gets taken by a squid alien that is climbing up the side of the building. Oliver tries to stop her, but fails, and barely escapes himself. The squid alien that consumes Candice is blown apart by a rocket fired by the soldiers on the roof of the nearby building.On the roof, Jarrod and Elaine see that the soldiers are from a U.S. Navy fleet that has arrived off-shore. In the distance near the ruins of downtown L.A., the alien spaceship, surrounded by blue light, continues to slowly repair itself. They witness another huge aerial battle as U.S. Navy jet fighters appear and battle stomping tankers and flying alien drones, with little success. A military helicopter that Jarrod and Elaine try to wave down gets tongued and destroyed by another tanker alien that scales the other building. The tanker is blown down from the building by a rocket fired by the soldiers, but it gets back up and begins to climb up the side of the building towards the apartment.With the windows and shades now blown out and nowhere to run or hide, Oliver gives it all up as hopeless. He turns on the gas stove and lets it accumulate. When the tanker alien reaches the apartment and tries to tentacle him, he flicks a lighter and blows himself and the alien up.When Jarrod and Elaine see Oliver's fireball from the rooftop, they realize it's clear and hopeless as the aliens are unstoppable.Jarrod and Elaine turn around to go back downstairs, but there is a squid alien in the stairwell blocking their path which bursts through the fire door at them. Jarrod tries to fight it off with a fire axe while Elaine escapes. When Jarrod chops off one of the squid alien's tentacles, it picks the severed piece up and re-attaches it. The squid alien stabs Jarrod in his right leg which enables it to try hook another one of it's tentacles to his head as it apparently prepares to consume his brain too. As he writhes on the rooftop, Elaine grabs the axe and hacks the alien's brain out. But even without it's brain, the squid alien still won't die and it turns to concentrate on her; while it is distracted Jarrod bashes its head in with a cinder-block, then his fists, then he starts pulling black gooey brain matter and membrane out with his bare hands in slow-motion apparently killing it for good.Elaine and Jarrod are still on the rooftop surrounded by more flying drones, squid and hulking tanker aliens and they climb higher trying to find any safe place. They are confronted by a burned tanker alien (the same one that Oliver attempted to destroy by blowing up the apartment), burned to a crisp. Just then, a F-22 fighter jet, hit by another flying alien drone, crashes into the tanker and takes it out just before it gets Jarrod and Elaine, who end up lying on the helipad at the very top of the building as the large alien ship, now having completely repaired itself, slowly cruises over the building. Many more alien ships return and begin releasing their blue lights and vacuuming up the few surviving people in the city. Exhausted and seeing that the aliens have totally defeated the military and all of the U.S. Navy ships off shore are on fire and sinking, Elaine and Jarrod can run no longer. Giving up as hopeless, they both look up at the hovering spaceship and go veiny. They kiss and hold each other as they are sucked up into the ship.Next, there is a montage of shots of global cites all in ruins with alien ships over them (New York, London, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, etc.). There appears to be no way of stopping the alien invasion. It is very clear at this point that humanity is doomed and the aliens have won.Day 3. Elaine wakes up in the alien ship inside a dark chamber, covered in black tarry goo. There are dead people and tentacles everywhere, the former having their brains sucked out by the latter. The brains move through tubes further into the craft. The headless bodies are dropped into a pool of liquid far below. Elaine crawls through bloodied and gooey dead human bodies looking for Jarrod. Just as she finds him his brain is sucked out by a tentacled machine. She is upset. As she is about to have her brain sucked out a tentacle realizes Elaine is pregnant. She is sucked into a larger tube.The sucked-out brains come to a place where new, sloth-like creatures are made; they're just waiting for a human brain. Most brains are blue-green colored, but one arrives that is orange/red (from the timing we are led to believe this is Jarrod's). The alien entity which receives it convulses and is overtaken with Jarrod's consciousness. It is upset at being an alien in a world of goo and rampages a bit.Elaine is spat out into a different chamber full of other pregnant women and is covered with tentacles which are presumably going to do unspeakably horrid things to her, as the other women are screaming in terror. Jarrod-alien hears Elaine's voice and crashes through the wall, fighting off the tentacles and saving her. He touches her stomach, we hear a rapid heartbeat, he strokes her face with his new, three fingered paw. Elaine recognizes the alien as Jarrod. Jarrod-Alien rises up triumphantly, standing guard over his love. He picks her up and holds her as more alien tentacles converge on him.On this cliffhanger note, the movie ends with a series of still images between the closing credits that depict the new ""Jarrod"" protecting Elaine and their unborn child from other aliens. Eventually alien ""Jarrod"" defeats them, picks his wife up, and runs off with her into the bowels of the alien spaceship."

He consults a successful escape artist turned author, and he starts planning: he'll need to disrupt jail routine, get IDs and passports, know how to evade a dragnet, find a destination, and squirrel away cash.

He threatens her that she needs to call Luke and tell him not to expect her he's waiting for her. Then she's with him. They walk quickly through the hospital, first with white lab coats, which they ditch to try to throw the cops off their trail. They come face to face with Nabulsi but manage to escape in the eleavtor. They change clothes several times. They blend in with the crowd, but Nabulsi is on their tail. They board a commuter train.

At the last second, he ditches the zoo plan and enters an interstate. He explains about road blocks and that they will come back for Luke somehow later. Lara opens the car door, apparently attempting suicide and lets herself fall. John grabs her and manages to control the spinning SUV. After a reconcilatory pause they drive off, take the next exit and head to the zoo. John finds Luke without any trouble in the aquarium room at the zoo. Nicole sees Lara in the vehicle, the family get in the SUV and drive to a train station.Nabulsi tells his chief on the phone that he's sorry the Mayor was delayed in a roadblock, he had only ordered his cops to stop couples with a kid not every car. When John approaches a toll booth road block they are waved through, it turns out that they had picked up an elderly couple.Nabulsi's detectives find John's garbage and are trying to piece together the plan he had mounted on a wall.

A junkie mugger slammed a fire extinguisher into Lara's boss's head. As Lara walked to her adjacent car, she physically bumps into the mugger. Lara picks up the fire extinguisher because it is blocking her car but can't see the body on the far side of her car. She leaves the parking garage. A man sees her leave and the boss's body. It was raining that night, and it's raining tonight too. The male detective drops a piece of paper to see where the button would have gone (off of the junkie's jacket Lara said she heard a button pop). It ends up in a catch basin by the curb. The detectives lift the grate off but don't see a button, but it's there. The cops decide to drop it and return to regular work.At his home, John's father opens an atlas and flips to the Caribbean coast of South America, he smiles.John, Lara, and Luke are in a hotel room in Venezuela. Luke has finally kissed his mom goodnight again as Lara and Luke sleep blissfully on the bed and John takes a picture."

Nic and Jules are in a long term, committed, loving but by no means perfect same-sex relationship. Nic, a physician, needs to wield what she believes is control, whereas Jules, under that control, is less self-assured. During their relationship, Jules has floundered in her ""nine to five"" life, sometimes trying to start a business - always unsuccessfully - or being the stay-at-home mom. She is currently trying to start a landscape design business. They have two teen-aged children, Joni (conceived by Nic) and Laser (by Jules). Although not exact replicas, each offspring does more closely resemble his/her biological mother in temperament. Joni and Laser are also half-siblings, having the same unknown sperm donor father. Shortly after Joni's eighteenth birthday and shortly before she plans to leave the house and head off to college, Laser, only fifteen and underage to do so, pleads with her to try and contact their sperm donor father. Somewhat reluctantly, she does. He is late thirty-something Paul, a co-op farmer and restaurateur. Despite his seemingly successful businesses, Paul has always shirked responsibility, most specifically in his personal life. After Joni and Laser meet with Paul, Nic and Jules learn what their children have done and, although they don't want Paul infiltrating their lives, want to meet him - especially as Joni and Laser seem to want to maintain some sort of relationship with him. As Paul's relationship with the entire family grows (which includes his hiring Jules to design and construct his backyard), they have an effect on what he wants in life. In turn, he affects their family dynamic as well as each person's relationships outside of it.—Huggo In LA, Nic and Jules are a couple with a daughter, Joni, on her way to college and a son, Laser, at 15 a good athlete but maybe hanging out with the wrong pal. Laser wants Joni, who's now 18, to find out who their biological father is - a sperm donor. Without initially telling their moms, they meet him. He's Paul, a cool guy with a motorcycle, a restaurant, and an organic garden. Although Nic doesn't like the idea, the five of them get together a few times and the kids spend time with Paul. He hires Jules, who's had many brief vocations, to landscape his back yard, and Nic, who's an OB/GYN, decides to be a good sport and get to know Paul better.

Out of the blue, Joni decides to seek out her biological father and she finds Paul, who is a businessman with a restaurant and a nontrangenic plantation. After the first encounter, they invite Paul to have dinner with their family and Paul hires Jules to transform his back garden. Paul gets close to Joni and Laser and has a love affair with Jules. He falls in love for her, but Jules still loves Nic. Meanwhile Nic feels that she is losing her authority with the children and is jealous of Paul. How will this triangle of love end?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a lesbian couple who have each given birth to a child using the same anonymous sperm donor. Nic, an obstetrician, is the primary breadwinner and the stricter parent, while Jules is more laid back and after previous failures to launch a career, is starting up a landscape design business. While the family functions well, their relationship has begun to go stale.The younger child, Laser (Josh Hutcherson) is eager to find his biological father, but has to be 18 to do so.

Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle and Paul is enthused about being in their lives. While Joni swears Laser to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers, they find out and invite Paul over to dinner, which while awkward is amiable. When Jules reveals that she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to landscape his back garden, to which Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea.While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic, who Jules feels, never supports her career attempts. Jules impulsively kisses him one afternoon, and they end up in bed together and begin an affair.Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul.

After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests that they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the situation. Things begin to improve as Nic relaxes and makes a connection with Paul over their mutual love of Joni Mitchell. During the dinner, however, Nic is shocked to discover traces of Jules's (red) hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom. When they return home, Nic confronts Jules. At first, Jules denies the affair but then admits to it. While Nic is devastated, Jules insists she is not in love with Paul and has not turned straight; she just wanted to be appreciated. The household becomes tense, with Jules sleeping on the couch and the children angry at both Jules and Paul. Paul thinks he has fallen for Jules, and since the relationship between Nic and Jules has deteriorated anyway, he suggests that she leave Nic, bring the kids, and come live with him, which Jules declines.The night before Joni leaves for college, Paul turns up at the house. Nic angrily confronts him, calling him an interloper, and tells him that if he wants a family then he should make one of his own. Following this, Jules addresses her family. She states that marriage is hard, and tearfully admits her errors and begs their forgiveness. The next morning, the family, pointedly without Paul, takes Joni to college. As Nic and Jules together hug Joni goodbye, they also affectionately touch each other. During the ride home, Laser tells his moms, ""You guys shouldn't break up"" because they're ""too old"".

Country Strong,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1555064/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A rising country-music songwriter works with a fallen star to work their way to fame, causing romantic complications along the way. A drama centered on a rising country-music songwriter (Hedlund) who sparks with a fallen star (Paltrow). Together, they mount his ascent and her comeback, which leads to romantic complications involving her husband/manager (McGraw) and a beauty queen-turned-singer (Meester).—Anonymous While five months pregnant, country music superstar Kelly Canter, drunk with a blood alcohol level of 0.19, trips on stage in a concert in Dallas, the fall resulting in her losing the baby. As such, she goes into alcohol rehab. There, she befriends an orderly, Beau Hutton, a singer songwriter who performs at local bars. He doesn't believe love and fame can coexist, he generally choosing the former. His and Kelly's relationship becomes more than just friends. Kelly is ultimately released one month earlier than scheduled, following which her business manager husband, James Canter, who has been with her since before fame hit her life, plans a short three city tour through Texas as her comeback, that tour culminating at the scene of the crime, Dallas. Although they still do love each other, their relationship currently is more as business manager and talent than husband and wife. While Kelly wants Beau as her opening act on this tour, James instead is leaning toward hiring an up and coming singer, Chiles Stanton, a former beauty queen who has had issues with stage fright. Based on her pageant training, she overcompensates for what she believes are the deficiencies in herself. Based on what he sees at Chiles' performance at a local bar where Beau is also performing, James decides to hire both, hoping that they will perform as a duo, which Beau refuses. Kelly believes Chiles wants to sleep her way to the top, either already having entered into an affair with James, or will do so during the tour. The interrelationships between the four during the tour will have a profound effect on what happens to them post-tour, most specifically if Kelly and Chiles will be able to overcome their specific insecurities to blossom personally and professionally, and if Beau will be sucked into the want for fame after playing the arena venues.—Huggo WARNING! The Synopsis may contain Spoilers!Best Line: Fame and love cant live in the same place.Country Strong is a very well written and well acted movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the aging Kelly Canter; a country western star with a past, Tim McGraw as her husband/manager James Canter; Garrett Hedlund as Beau Hutton a young country western singer working part time at clubs and part time at a rehab center; and Leighton Meester as Chiles Stanton a Beauty Queen want-to-be country western star.Country Strong is a movie that takes a look at things most of us dont want to even acknowledge, addiction. The writer, Shana Feste does a very good job; shes either been there or knows someone close to her whos gone through it because shes captured very, very well small nuisances that most of us would not even see. Most times you see a movie and it shows one side or the other, but Country Strong shows that pain of the disease comes to both user and care giver; in this case, the talent, Kelly; and her husband/manager, James trying to save her career or at least to let her go out gracefully, but more towards keeping her on the stage and bringing in the money. What got her into rehab was being drunk at her concert, being pregnant, and tripping over a cord and falling ten feet losing the baby.We meet Kelly and Beau playing with song lyrics in the first scene at the rehab, after we get a performance by Garrett Hedlund singing. They are interrupted by Kellys husband, James, who is there to take Kelly out of rehab early and get her back working. This happens too often; usually the drinker convinces the care giver that they are fine now; the care giver wants to believe it, and even though it shouldnt happenthe addict leaves early with still no skills at dealing with the bumps in life.Then we meet Chiles Stanton getting ready to sing at a club to become Kellys opening act, even though Kelly wants Beau to open for her. Beau is offended to hear this Beauty Queen is singing at the famous club he sings at, feels she hasnt earned the right, isnt good enough, doesnt fit the mold after all, Patsy Cline had sung there. Really the situation represents her being there at all, that anyone is auditioning to be Kellys opening act because he believes she should stay in treatment and the last thing she should be doing is going back out on tour. Beau feeds Chiles some snide remarks, reminding her that she usually chokes when she tries to sing anyway. His prediction does indeed happen. After a few attempts of trying and freezing up he cant just let her go down like that so he starts a duet with her to get her started, whatever else Beau is, if he sees a solution his compassion kicks in and he has to help.James sees this as an opportunity to get someone on the road with them that will help with Chiles and with Kelly so he agrees to have Beau tour with them.Kelly is a typical fragile drunk out of rehab, she needed more time there; she has no skills, she still sees the world a bit skewed and she has no coping skills. Armed with nothing she attempts to return to the business that demands everything of her. She still has the alcoholics dramatic way of seeing what they want to see, not asking what is true or correct, but just taking that feeling and running with it. First concert: shes doing pretty good, then she stumbles onto an innocent conversation between James and Chiles about her wardrobe not clashing with Kellys and all Kelly sees is that James is interested in Chiles. Then a delivery man shows up with gifts from sponsors and special fans (screened) but somehow a box slips through and it has a doll with blood all over it Xed out eyes and the word Baby killer. That was more than she could stand so she did the only familiar thing, she fortified herself with a bottle of vodka.We get to see the care giver side a little. James has picked Kelly up early, she demands that Beau open for her. They are in bed and she asks him how talented she is, she needs to hear that he still sees her the same. She apologizes for Dallas (meaning losing the baby) and says that they should talk about it. Something she learned while in rehab, owning up up to what we did and facing what the other person has to say. Then she makes a romantic gesture and he announces he has just taken an Ambein and hell see her in eight hours. So at the concert she believes shes seen James in a clandestine situation and now she has gotten the doll; without enough rehab under her belt she returns to the only thing she knows works. Now it is up to James to get her out of the closet and on the stage. He gets her to let him in and he sits next to her trying to reason with her that there are sick people who will never forget and that she needs to prove them wrong and get out there and show them that she is not that person anymore. He begins to lose patience and tries to pull her from the closet and without thinking she slaps him. Now the oh so familiar alcoholic behavior, apologies, Ill do anything you want, please, Im sorry, please like me like I used to be. The caregiver now has the upper hand, he can get her to do whatever he wants. He gets her on stage, but she is drunk, the singing lasts only a short time then she starts blathering, forgetting where she is and what is expected of her. She tries one time to sing but ends up crying and has to be escorted off the stage.James becomes angry with Beau demanding to know where he was when she got the vodka. Beau replies, I was on stage! James becomes angry proclaiming that Beau should have some tricks up his sleeve to keep from doing this. Beau replies, Yeah, dont take her out of rehab before the rehab!The next tour stop is Austin, everyone worries if Kelly can hold it together for that performance. Kelly is trying desperately to have James the way they used to be. She remembers the way they used to be and wants him to see her the same way again. James feels like he lives with two different women, one is the one he fell in love with and the one he has no idea what shell do next. He seen her lose their baby, slap him, and fall apart on stage. Hes running out of excuses for her.Kelly sober and trying to rebound again, tries to see the world good again and decides Beau should see a recording studio because she feels certain he will be recording after this tour because it is natural for him, he doesnt care for who, he just loves writing and singing. When they arrive at the recording studio, Chiles is recording the song that she wanted to close her Dallas show with and record for herself. Since James is her manager she sees him as a conspirator and back stabber, so shes off and running again, though everyone thinks she went back to the trailer.James and Beau have an interesting conversation about what kind of man Beau thinks James must be. James admits he has no idea when she became so fragile, that she used be so strong, and that all she wanted was to be on stage. That he has no idea what to do with this new Kelly. Beau tells James that they should turn the bus around and put her back in rehab. James says he just cant let her go out like that; that at one time she had such a fire inside her and hopes that she can get that back. That James was her sponsor, he must have seen it, Beau admits that they both know he wasnt her sponsor, and James decks him.The Austin Show is doomed from the start. Believing that she is in the trailer, no one seems concerned until it gets close to show time and no one knows where she is; Beau figuring he can find the crap kind of bar shed end up in and he does find her. She is however completely smashed. He has Chiles bring a taxi down so that they can get her back, Kelly tells Chiles that Beau is a good guy. They unfortunately come in a door where the promoter sees her condition; Thats it were done.James again feels slapped in the face by that other Kelly. He just walks away. From the first botched concert her public relations outfit puts together good publicity by having her make an appearance for the Make a Wish Foundation where she would visit a little boy with leukemia. After the botched 2nd concert James tells her it has been cancelled. Kelly visits the promoter and gets the Dallas concert back. James is not really happy about this at all, but does his job.Kelly visits the school and a little boy named Travis who has leukemia and sings a song she makes up on the spot about him. Then she dances with him and gets the whole class to dance. James comes and dances with Kelly which surprises her and she loves it. To her it is just like when they were young and loved each other. After a few minutes James looks at her, stops dancing and walks down the hall and sits on a bench crying. This is the woman he loves, but how long will she be this woman, in his mind he sees her vomiting, slapping him, sleeping with other men, their lost baby, and he realizes he has to keep her at arms length because she has the power to hurt him so much, it is not easier to be her manager, she makes him look bad all the time, but as a wife and love, she could destroy him.When he pulls away, Kelly realizes that they will never have any other kind of relationship and, I believe it is then that she decides what she will do.Like I said, two people, a drinker and their care giver, share such a volatile relationship, the drinker needs to stop drinking and examine their drinking life. The caregiver has to decide for themselves whether they can risk whether they can take anymore. Alcohol is a legal drug, but it ruins more families, loses more jobs, kills more people, cuts production at the workplace more than all the other drugs combined.Her last show is very good."

But there is the menace of Haru/Hara who wants to capture the tiny people.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil &#12302;&#20511;&#12426;&#12368;&#12425;&#12375;&#12398;&#12450;&#12522;&#12456;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;&#12303;Before surgery for his heart, a young boy named Sho is sent to his family's estate to rest by his Aunt. The estate is is comprised of a small house amid a sprawling green landscape.During his first moments on the grounds, Sho views the house cat, Niya, who is looking at something in some plants. After Niya leaves, Sho catches sight of what appears to be a miniature human.This is Arrietty, the daughter of a family of 'Borrowers' that live in a dwelling under the house's floorboards.Arrietty returns to her parents, where her father Pod informs her and her mother Homily about Sho's arrival. Though Homily fears for their safety, Pod reassures the family that Sho has a heart condition, so he probably won't cause them much trouble.Arrietty is relieved, as her father had intended to take her on her first 'borrowing' within the walls of the house. Later on that evening, she accompanies her father on a quest to obtain a cube of sugar and some tissue paper.The they get the cube of sugar from the kitchen. For the tissues, Arrietty and Pod climb to the house's second floor, where they make their way through an intricate dollhouse and into a guest bedroom. The two attempt to get the tissue paper, but Arrietty freezes when it seems that Sho has seen her! In her attempts to leave, she drops the sugar cube. As she and Pod leave, Sho addresses her, asking if she is like the little people that his Mother told stories about.When they return empty-handed, Pod makes up an excuse that his light gave out.The next day, Arrietty is surprised when the boy stops near a grate near their home and leaves a cube of sugar and a small note. Arrietty tells her parents about this, and Homily is informed by Pod that knowledge of their presence may mean they will have to leave their home.Arrietty ponders what to do, and returns to the sugar cube. Upon reading the note (""you left something behind""), she takes the items, and climbing up to the second floor, addresses Sho through his window. Returning the cube, she requests that he leave their family alone. However, the moment is interrupted when a crow attempts to eat Arrietty and ends up stuck in the wire mesh of the window. Sho saves Arrietty from falling and hides her as the housekeeper Haru comes in, managing to get the crow loose. After she leaves, Sho realizes that Arrietty has snuck off.Attempting to return home, she encounters Pod, who informs her and Homily later on that they will have to move.In the evening, Sho has dinner with his Aunt and Haru. Sho's conversation turns to the dollhouse, and his Aunt explains that their father told her and Sho's Mom that it was made for the little people that he had seen. After dinner, all three go upstairs to appreciate the detailed intricacy of the house.Later on, as Arrietty and Homily stitch sacks to carry their belongings, Pod comes home with the help of another Borrower named Spiller. Pod has twisted his ankle. The existence of another Borrower fills Arrietty and Homily with hope that they aren't the last of their kind, and Spiller agrees to help them find a new place.After he leaves, Pod explains to Arrietty that before she was born, there were two other families of Borrowers that lived in the house. One of them disappeared, and the other moved away.Suddenly, the dwelling is shaken as the ceiling is removed. Though it seems that they have been discovered, it is actually Sho, who removes the family's small kitchen, and replaces it with the one in the dollhouse upstairs.However, the gesture of kindness does nothing more than increase the family's determination to leave. After recovering from his sprain, Pod leaves to search out Spiller and a new place, while Homily continues to pack. Meanwhile, Arrietty finds Sho out in the garden with Niya. Though Sho seems happy to have gifted the kitchen to the Borrowers, Arrietty confesses that his knowledge of their existence has caused her family to prepare to move away.Sho asks if he can look at her, to which she doesn't say anything, as it makes no difference anymore. He tells her she's beautiful. Then he asks questions about Borrowers and says that there must be very few left and soon there will be none, that's fate. To which Arrietty gets upset and says it's his fault they have to leave, but they're going to survive, they are not going to die. Sho apologizes and says that she's right, he's the one who's going to die. He tells her about his heart condition and hopes she can forgive him for everything. Arrietty is taken aback by this confession and seems deeply affected and saddened to find out about his sickness.Haru finds the Borrowers' home, with Homily in the dollhouse kitchen, and takes her and puts her in a jar, making sure she can breathe in there. Then she calls a pest control company saying she wants trapping service for something in the house that she doesn't want killed.When Arrietty finds that her mother was taken she goes to Sho and he helps rescue her. He also takes the dollhouse kitchen back in the dollhouse in his room, so when Haru tries to prove what she saw, she has nothing.Arrietty's family leaves. They are followed by Niya, the cat, who goes back and brings Sho to say goodbye. He brings a sugar cube as a gift, and Arrietty gives him her hair clip, for good luck with his oncoming heart surgery.The Borrowers are sailing away in a teapot with Spiller. Arrietty looks sad and Spiller awkwardly offers her a fruit. He's very happy when she takes it. A fish swimming in the shallow water catches her interest, seeming huge next to them. The film ends on a serene, yet kind of sad, note."

He goes to a graveyard where his father (Pierce Brosnan) his mother (Lena Olin) and his sister (Ruby Jerins) are laying stones on a grave. The grave belongs to a Michael Hawkins. They go to a coffee shop and his mother remarks that Michael would have liked to know they still went to the coffee shop. The coffee shop was Michael and Tyler's special place. Tyler's sister Caroline begins to talk about an art exhibit she has when her father rudely interrupts her to ask for the sugar. Tyler yells at his father and runs out of the coffee shop. Before leaving he moves the sugar away from his father.We see Tyler walking with his roommate Aidan (Tate Ellington). Aidan suggests selling a kit to girls who have one night stands.

He sees Ally and her father pull up and he recognizes her father from the night before. He runs home to tell Tyler and suggests that Tyler take her out on a date and then dump her or steal her panties and sell them as revenge for her father scarring Tyler's face. Aidan points her out to Tyler when they're back at school and Tyler recognizes her from his social policies class. (Earlier we had seen her answer a question about terrorism in Tyler's class.) He tells her he is doing an experiment with women in their early twenties to find out how much of an A-hole Aidan is. She says she's 19 and he offers to take her to dinner as the reward for being in the survey.

We see them at the restaurant where she explains why she orders her dessert first. We learn she is constantly wary of death and has a fear of asteroids. They go to a fair and Tyler pays off a game attendant to get a panda for Ally. She gets into a taxi (she doesn't take the subway) and Tyler tries to kiss her.

127 Hours,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1542344/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mountain climber becomes trapped under a boulder while canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah and resorts to desperate measures in order to survive. 127 Hours is the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston's remarkable adventure to save himself after a fallen boulder crashes on his arm and traps him in an isolated canyon in Utah. Over the next five days Ralston examines his life and survives the elements to finally discover he has the courage and the wherewithal to extricate himself by any means necessary, scale a 65 foot wall and hike over eight miles before he can be rescued. Throughout his journey, Ralston recalls friends, lovers, family, and the two hikers he met before his accident. Will they be the last two people he ever had the chance to meet?—Fox Searchlight Pictures Outdoor adventuristAron Ralstonbelieves he's invincible and can do it all alone while on his outdoor adventures. He considers the great outdoors his second home. On Saturday, April 26, 2003, Aron has gone for an adventure trek alone through the generally secluded Blue John Canyon, and like he has done on many of his other treks, he has not told anyone where he is going. But on this day, he and a small boulder fall down a crevice, he landing near the bottom of the crevice virtually unharmed, but with his right hand wedged between the boulder and the crevice wall. He has access to his gear and his small supply of rations as he tries to move the boulder or chip away at it so that he can get his wedged hand free. As either task seems impossible, he hopes for someone to rescue him. Those most likely candidates are Kristi and Megan, two women he met earlier that day who are the only two who know that he is in the canyon, or his boss Brion, who may list him as missing if he doesn't show up for his scheduled work time on Tuesday (three days away). As time goes on and he deals not only with the boulder and lack of rations but also with the extreme weather conditions, he begins to think about his mortality, his mind often going toward his loving but somewhat distant relationship with his family, or his last broken love with a woman named Rana. As he films himself (as a goodbye message to his family) often with his mind wandering, he, during his more lucid moments, also thinks about the possibility of trying to sever his arm as he will lose it anyway if he survives this ordeal.—Huggo On April 2003, the engineer, climber and canyoneer Aron Ralston travels to Blue John Canyon without telling anyone to spend the weekend doing what he likes to do: climb the isolated canyon. He meets the teenagers Kristi and Megan that are lost and they spend a couple of hours together bathing in a lake in a cave. He says goodbye to them and while descending a canyon crack, a chockstone comes loose rolling onto his arm. Aron realizes that he is stuck and he tries to find a way to release the stone. Along five days short of water and without food, Aron becomes delusional and recalls his family and friends. After the fifth day, he decides to sever his forearm to survive.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On Friday night 25, April 2003, the engineer goes to the Blue John Canyon, Utah. And on Saturday morning explores the canyon on his bike. He considered the outdoors to be his second home. He over there meets two teenagers - Kristi and Megan who are lost. He helps them and they all have fun for a few hours in a lake. Then Aron continues alone. That day at the peak afternoon he and a boulder fall down in a canyon and his hand is wedged between the boulder and the canyon wall. He makes many tries to pull out his wedged hand and to move the boulder but is unsuccessful every time. He tries to call out for help many times. He spends 127 hours (more than 5 days) with his limited rations. He also tries to chip of the boulder so that he can free his hand but is again unsuccessful. He hopes for someone to rescue him. Those most likely candidates are Kristi and Megan, two women he met earlier that day who are the only two who know that he is in the canyon, or his boss Brion, who may list him as missing if he doesn't show up for his scheduled work time on Tuesday (three days away). He goes through many difficulties and deals with the extreme weather conditions. He spends his time trying to get his hand free and by making a goodbye message for his parents, especially his mom. at first he had lost all his hopes and had even engraved ARON RALSTON R.I.P 1975-2003 but in the end, left with no option, Aron gathers the courage to take extreme measures in order to survive.—Ishaan Ohri In April 2003, avid mountaineer Aron Ralston goes hiking at Utah's Canyonlands National Park without telling anyone, which is a very unwise decision. He befriends hikers Kristi and Megan, and shows them an underground pool before they head home. After that, Aron continues on through a slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon. While climbing, he loses grip and falls, knocking a boulder which traps his right arm against the wall. Aron attempts to move the boulder but it won't budge; he also soon realizes he is alone. He shortly begins recording a video diary using his camcorder to maintain morale, as he chips away parts of the boulder with a pocket knife. Over the next five days, Aron rations his food and remaining 300ml of water, struggles to keep warm at night, and is forced to drink his urine when his water runs out. He also sets up a pulley using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder.Throughout the days, Aron becomes desperate and depressed, and begins hallucinating about escape, relationships, and past experiences including his family and his former girlfriend, Rana. During one hallucination, Aron realizes that his mistake was that he did not tell anyone where he was going or for how long, and decides that destiny has trapped him with the boulder. On the sixth day, Aron has a vision of his future son, spurring his will to survive. He fashions a tourniquet from CamelBak tube insulation and uses a carabiner to tighten it. Then, using his knowledge of torque, he breaks the bones in his arm and, using the multi-tool, slowly amputates it. Aron then wraps the stump to prevent exsanguination, and takes a picture of the boulder before rappelling down a 65 ft (20 m) rockface. He then finds some rain water collected while descending down, and drinks the stagnant water due to dehydration and continues. Back in the desert, he spots a family on a hike and calls for help. They give him water and alert the authorities; a Utah Highway Patrol helicopter brings him to a hospital.During the end credits, it is revealed that years later, Aron got married and had a son (as seen in his vision). He also continues climbing, and always leaves a note telling his family where he has gone."

The Ghost Writer,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139328/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A ghost writer, hired to complete the memoirs of a former British Prime Minister, uncovers secrets that put his own life in jeopardy. An unremarkable ghost-writer has landed a lucrative contract to redact the memoirs of Adam Lang, the former UK Prime Minister. After dominating British politics for years, Lang is campaigning for his foundation with his wife in the USA. He lives on an island, in luxurious, isolated premises complete with a security detail and a secretarial staff. Soon, Adam Lang gets embroiled in a major scandal with international ramifications that reveals how far he was ready to go in order to nurture UK's ""special relationship"" with the USA. But before this controversy has started, before even he has closed the deal with the publisher, the ghost-writer gets unmistakable signs that the turgid draft he is tasked to put into shape inexplicably constitutes highly sensitive material.—Eduardo Casais <casaise@acm.org> In London, the agent Rick Ricardelli invites his friend to apply to the Rhinehart, Inc. as ghostwriter of the former unpopular British Prime Minister Adam Lang. He is hired to complete and revise Adam's memoir since his predecessor Mike McAra had an accident or committed suicide and was found drowned on the coast. The ghostwriter travels to the Island Town of Old Haven where Adam presently lives with his wife Ruth and sooner the writer feels the tension between Ruth and Adam's secretary and mistress Amelia Bly. When Adam Lang is involved in a human rights scandal, the ghostwriter accidentally discovers that Mike had some hidden pictures and a telephone number in his room. The ghostwriter decides to investigate and learns that Adam's political career might have been built by the CIA to support the controversial decisions of the American government. Further, he finds that his life is in a great danger.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A young British writer, who has had some minor success as a ghost writer, is hired to finish writing the almost completed memoirs of former British Prime Minister, Adam Lang. The Ghost, as he is forthwith referred to, is hired despite having little to no experience in the political writing realm. The $250,000, one month job is due to the fact that his predecessor, Lang's former aide Michael McCarra, suddenly died after falling off the ferry between the US mainland and Old Haven, the northeast US island where he had been working and where Lang and his entourage have been staying at the Lang's recreational compound. It is unclear if McCarra's death was suicide, an accident or murder. The mysterious death unnerves the Ghost, who believes the same fate may befall him if indeed McCarra was murdered because of this job. The Ghost is certain that he is not being told the complete story about Lang's life whether it be by Lang himself, Lang's seemingly more politically astute wife Ruth, or Lang's primary aide, Amelia Bly, with who Ruth believes her husband is having an affair. Lang, as a young man, had no political aspirations - he wanted to become an actor - and states that he fell into politics to impress politically active Ruth, who he had just met at Cambridge. The Ghost's job becomes more difficult when the International Criminal Court charges Lang with war crimes while he was PM, the charges related to handing over suspected terrorists to the CIA for torture. After the Ghost comes across some of McCarra's personal effects related to the memoir, the Ghost goes on a search for the truth related to the ICC charge, McCarra's death and what he is not being told about Lang, which he believes can be found within the only hard copy version of the memoir written by McCarra.—Huggo ""When a successful ghostwriter, the Ghost (Ewan McGregor), agrees to finish the memoirs of Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), England's former prime minister, his publisher assures him it's the chance of a lifetime.

But the project seems doomed from the start not least because his predecessor on the project, Lang's long-term aide, died in an apparent accident. The ghostwriter flies out to work on the project, in the middle of winter, at an oceanfront house in the fictional village of Old Haven (an allusion to Vineyard Haven) on Martha's Vineyard. But the day he arrives, a former British foreign minister named Rycart accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA a possible war crime. Lang faces the threat of prosecution by the International Criminal Court, unless he stays in the U.S. or goes to another country that does not recognize that court.The controversy brings reporters and protesters swarming to the security perimeter of the island home where Lang is staying with his wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams), and his personal assistant (and mistress), Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). As the ghostwriter works, he uncovers clues suggesting his predecessor may have stumbled on a dark secret concerning Lang and that somehow this information is hidden in the manuscript he left behind. During Lang's absence, the neglected Ruth sleeps with the writer. The writer also meets an old man (Eli Wallach) living locally, who tells him that there is no possible way the current could have taken the body of the dead writer from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach location where it was discovered. The old man also reveals that a woman saw flashlights on the beach the night the body was discovered, but later fell down her stairs and went into a coma.The next morning, the ghostwriter follows the GPS in the car of the previous writer, which leads him to the estate of Professor Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson), who also appears in college photographs with Lang which have been left behind by the previous ghost-writer. The ghostwriter can tell that Emmett is hiding something. As the writer leaves Emmett's estate, he is followed by a car, but eludes it. The writer boards the ferry, but then flees the boat as he sees the car that had followed him drive on board. He decides to spend the night on the mainland, and stays in a small motel and while there, finds information on the Internet that points to Paul Emmett as a CIA agent.The writer then contacts Rycart (Robert Pugh), whose phone number was among the effects of his predecessor, and who tells him that the previous writer had said that he had hidden information in the ""beginning"" of the book. The men cannot, however, find anything in the manuscript's early pages. Lang then calls and the writer is told by Rycart to go with Lang. The writer warns that Lang will be able to avoid Rycart no matter what he does. On the plane, the writer accuses Lang of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett, but Lang derides his suggestion.Upon departing the aircraft, Lang is assassinated, apparently by an anti-war protestor who had lost a son. The apparent assassin is in turn shot by police. The writer is interviewed and US authorities take his passport so that he can stay and provide information. Despite Lang's death, the ghostwriter is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication.During the launch party for the book, while talking to Amelia, she corrects the ""beginning"" clue as ""beginnings"" and Amelia also tells him that Paul Emmett was Ruth's tutor when she was a Fulbright scholar. He realizes that the clues were hidden in the original manuscript at the beginning of each chapter. He underlines the words at the beginning of each chapter and reveals the message, ""Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University."" Ruth Lang has shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the United States as directed by the CIA. After passing a note to Ruth of his discovery, the ghostwriter leaves the party with the original manuscript in hand. As he crosses the street off-camera, a car accelerates in his direction, and sound effects and flying papers indicate that he has been hit."

Repo Men,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1053424/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set in the near future when artificial organs can be bought on credit, it revolves around a man who struggles to make the payments on a heart he has purchased. He must therefore go on the run before said ticker is repossessed. In the near future, the company ""The Union"" provides expensive prosthesis to improve the lives of the clients. However, the company sends repo men to retrieve the artificial organs for those that do not pay the installments. The former soldiers Remy and his best friend Jake are among the best repo men of the company; however Remy's job cost his marriage and his wife Carol leaves him. When Remy is ready to request to be transferred to the sales department expecting to save his marriage, he has an accident with a defibrillator and he needs heart transplantation. The prosthesis is very expensive and Remy changes his behavior after the medical procedure, and he is no longer capable of chasing the debtors. Meanwhile Remy helps the singer Beth, who owes a large amount to The Union, and sooner they are chased by the repo men.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 2025, a corporation called The Union has perfected the creation of artificial organs, which have replaced organ transplants. A potential customer can apply for an organ, which is sold on credit, at high interest. If a customer is unable to maintain payments, after three months, a repo-man is sent after the customer to 'reclaim' Union property. The process of the repossession is bloody & brutal, and often results in the death of the customer.Remy is one of the Union's top repo-men, who partners with his childhood friend, Jake, to collect on past due accounts. Remy is highly regarded within The Union as their top performer, though his occupation causes problems with his wife, who sees it as unsavory. After she leaves Remy when Jake commits a repossession in front of their home, Remy decides to transfer to a sales job, much to Jake's chagrin.As his final repossession job, Remy is sent to the residence of a music producer, whose work he happens to admire. After allowing the man enough time to complete a song, Remy prepares to repossess his heart. When he attempts to use a heart defibrillator to stop the unit, the defibrillator malfunctions, sending a large electrical shock through his body and knocking him into a coma. When Remy awakens from his coma, he is informed by Jake and Frank, his co-workers, that the shock severely damaged his heart. He can be fitted with an artificial heart, or die. When Remy attempts to flee the hospital, he quickly becomes winded and weak & is unable to escape. He reluctantly agrees to the procedure.Remy goes back to work, but is unable to perform his job, because he is just like the people he is repossessing from. He attempts to transition into sales, but quickly finds himself behind in payments. Jake takes Remy to the outskirts of the city to a nest, which is a collection of people who have past due accounts with the Union, but are fleeing to avoid being repossessed. Remy is again unable to perform a repossession, after which he is abandoned by Jake until he can perform his job. Remy is attacked by a pair of men from whom he was expected to repossess artiforgs, and knocked out.Remy, upon awakening, encounters Beth, whom he had met earlier in a bar where she was singing. He discovers that she has multiple body parts on which she is past due, and is currently suffering from a drug addiction. Remy takes her to a motel room, where he stays with her as she goes through withdrawal. After Jake interrupts his attempt to falsify artiforg returns on both of them back at the Union's headquarters, Remy leaves unassailed by Jake, returns to Beth, & the two leave to live in the outskirts.The pair live, for a time, in relative harmony. Remy uses an old typewriter that Beth has found to type up a narrative of his life, and subsequent conversion. As he finishes, a repo-man arrives to repossess his heart, but as he approaches Remy, he falls through a hole Remy has covered in the damaged floor, crashing to the floor below, unconscious. Then Beth, who was hiding behind the door, also falls when the floor collapses under her, re-injuring her leg. From above, Remy sees the Repo man coming to, readying to tranquilize or taze Beth. Remy drops the heavy typewriter onto him through the floor, crushing his head, to save himself and Beth. Using the repo-man's vehicle, Remy sneaks back into his former workplace to obtain a pair of devices that fool organ scanners used by repo-men. He attempts to force Frank to clear his account, only to discover that due to his previous aborted attempt, all accounts can now only be cleared back at the Union's central office.Remy and Beth attempt to flee the country at the airport, but are taken by security when it is discovered that Beth's prosthetic knee was damaged in their earlier encounter with the repo-man. Once inside, they are forced to fight against airport security and another pair of repo-men. They are able to kill or incapacitate all of them, and while escaping, come face to face through impenetrable safety glass, with Jake, who has now been assigned Remy's account. The pair head to a black market doctor, where Beth's knee is replaced. After the procedure, the two are stopped by Jake, who has tracked the pair. A bitter fight ensues, during which Jake reveals that it was he who rigged the defibrillator unit to malfunction, necessitating Remy's heart replacement; he did this intending to ensure that Remy would have to keep his organ repossession job, so they could get promoted together. The two fight, but Jake gains the upper hand, and knocks Remy unconscious by hitting him in the head with a heavy steel chain & hook.Remy is awakened by Beth, and as they escape a raid by the Union's repo-men, they are pulled into a safe house by an underground network of artiforg refugees. The two survive the night, but Remy is overcome with remorse after finding the corpses of the victims of the Union raid. He resolves to destroy the corporation and clear the accounts of Beth and himself. After passing his story to his son during a brief meeting on a train, the pair travel to The Union's headquarters, hoping to remove themselves from the system. Remy and Beth are pursued throughout the building, and after an intense battle against Remy's former colleagues, arrive at the Pink Door, the main database for the Union. Scanning Beth's prosthetic eye, they are able to seal themselves inside just as Jake and Frank arrive. Once inside, they discover that the server does not have any interface, except for a scanner. Remy realizes that the only way to remove themselves from the system is to repo their artiforgs. Remy and Beth cut themselves open in order to use the scanner internally, clearing their accounts.Jake and Frank are able to enter through the use of an artificial organ removed from one of the guards killed by Remy, and see Remy trying desperately to resuscitate Beth, who has stopped breathing during the process. Jake asks Remy if she was worth all the hardship and pain that he has put himself through, which he confirms. Frank pulls a gun to kill Remy, but Jake turns on his employer, stabbing him with a knife. Jake then assists Remy in reviving Beth, after which he deposits two explosives inside the organ return unit. The explosion destroys the Union's mainframe, wiping all the client account records out of the system.Later, Remy is on a tropical beach, enjoying his freedom with Beth and Jake. His text from earlier in the film has been published into a book, The Repossession Mambo. Remy turns to look at Jake, but instead the background flickers and voices are heard. It is revealed that Remy, in fact, sustained brain injury when Jake hit him with the metal hook earlier in the film. Jake, out of guilt & remorse, has paid off Remy's account and has had him placed on a Neural Network machine, allowing him to live the rest of his life in a dream. Beth is still alive but unconscious, and when questioned as to what to do with her, Jake replies he'll ""take care of her"". This renders the second half of the film as simply a fantasy of Remy's. Jake finds Remy's manuscript, which he greets with a bitter chuckle, as his former partner is wheeled away, presumably to spend the rest of his days in his fantasy world. The film ends with Frank delivering his usual sales pitch in a commercial, then back to Remy's beach fantasy, where Jake is handing him a tropical drink, saying, ""A little fruit, for the fruit?"" (now, a 'vegetable'!) Remy leans back, looks down at Beth walking by the water, sips, smiles, and laughs."

Of course, if the boy survives the night and Abby's terrible secret.—Nick Riganas March 1983. Los Alamos, New Mexico. A group of police cars, with sirens wailing, escort an ambulance to Los Alamos Memorial Hospital. They are carrying an unidentified 50-year old man with acid burns to the face. He is placed on a respirator because the toxic fumes from the acid have seared his lungs and thus compromised his ability to breathe. A Detective (Elias Koteas) attempts to speak with him, asking him to identify himself and wondering whether he is a part of a Satanic cult. He gets no reply. A nurse calls him to the front desk to take a telephone call from the receptionist in the lobby who reports that the man's daughter is asking about him. Hearing a sudden change in the beeping of his respirator, the nurse returns to the man's room and screams. The man has jumped out of his tenth floor window to his death, leaving only a note that reads: ""I'm sory [sic] Abby"".Two weeks earlier. Twelve-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is sitting alone in the snow-covered courtyard of his apartment building, singing to himself, until his mother (Cara Buono) calls him for dinner. Owen's parents are in the process of a nasty divorce, and Owen is often left to eat alone and amuse himself by playing alone in his room. One evening, he notices a girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) about his age and her father (Richard Jenkins) moving into the apartment next door to his. Oddly, she is wearing no shoes.The next day at school, Owen is picked on as usual by three older boys -- Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and his friends Mark (Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak) and Donald (Nicolai Dorian). Out of fear, wimpy Owen doesn't fight back, even though they give him a wedgie, causing him to urinate on himself. That evening, as he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors, he notices the new girl, Abby, watching him. She's not very friendly and tells him right off that they can't be friends. Not long afterwards, her father walks through the courtyard. It is revealed to the viewers, and what Owen doesn't know, is that he is not Abby's father...he is her 'renfield' and Abby is a vampire. It is his job to bring Abby fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he stalks them, then renders them unconscious, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their jugular veins, and catches the blood in a jug.Unfortunately, 'Father' is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he stalks a local all-night supermarket where he breaks into the car of a local woman. At a railroad crossing, he knocks her out, takes her to the woods, strings her up by her ankles, slices her throat wide open and drains her of her blood. But afterwards, he trips in the snow, spilling the blood on the ground. Consequently, Abby is beginning to get hungry and annoyed.The next evening, Abby and Owen run into each other again in the courtyard. Once again, he notices that Abby is not wearing shoes. What's more, her stomach is growling fiercely, and she smells bad. Still, Owen shares with her his Rubik's cube and shows her how to work it. After Owen has gone inside, Abby goes hunting. She waits in the shadows under a bridge. When a man walks by, she feigns falling and asks him to help her. The man picks her up, intending to carry her to her home. Suddenly Abby latches onto him and bites his neck. Father is livid when Abby tells him what she has done, but he dutifully cleans it up by dumping the victim's body into a small lake.The next morning as he leaves for school, Owen finds his Rubik's Cube in the courtyard, completely solved. That evening, Abby is waiting for him in the courtyard. This time, she is more friendly and takes the time to explain to Owen how she went about solving the puzzle. She also smells better, but it's odd that she cannot remember her birth date when Owen asks. Since Abby doesn't know her birth date, she doesn't celebrate her birthdays and gets no presents, so Owen offers her the Rubik's cube.The next day, while the class is supposed to be watching Romeo and Juliet, Owen is busy copying the symbols for Morse code. He is later confronted in the lavatory by Kenny, Mark, and Donald. Kenny asks what he was working on during class. When Owen refuses to show him, Kenny hits Owen with a metal antenna, raising a gash on his left cheek. Owen later tells his distant and non-attentive mother at dinner that he fell during recess.After dinner, Owen meets with Abby as usual in the apartment courtyard. When she sees the bandaid on Owen's cheek, he tells her the truth about what happened. She warns him that he must hit them back hard and then they'll stop. If they don't stop, Abby promises to help him. Owen shares with Abby the Morse code that he copied. That night, they practice tapping on the wall that separates their apartments. The next day at school, Owen signs up for the weight-lifting program. Later, he takes Abby to an arcade and to play Ms. Pacman. He offers her a Now & Later (""Have one now, save one for later"") candy bar. At first, she refuses; then she tries one. When Owen finds her heaving on the sidewalk, he hugs her. Abby asks him whether or not he would still like her if she wasn't a girl. ""I guess so,"" Owen replies, not quite understanding what Abby is asking.As the friendship between Owen and Abby deepens, Father starts feeling jealous. He tries again to obtain blood for Abby. This time he chooses to hide in the back seat of a student's car and attack him on the road. His plan is foiled, however, when Jett's friend Greg asks for a lift. When Jett stops for gas, Father attacks Greg and drives off. The struggling boy causes them to go over an embankment and turn upside down, pinning Father under the car and killing Greg. Knowing that he is trapped and about to be discovered by the police, Father pours acid on his face so that he can't be identified. When Abby learns that he has been taken to a hospital, she shows up at the reception desk asking for her father. The receptionist tells her that he is on the 10th floor, so she climbs/flies up the outside of the building until she gets to his window. Father lets her in and offers her his neck. After Abby drinks his blood, he jumps out of the window and falls to his death. At the nurse's station outside Father's room, the Detective taking a call from the receptionist in the lobby hears the nurse scream. By the time the detective gets to Father's room, he has jumped out of his tenth floor window to his death, leaving only a note that reads: ""I'm sory Abby"".Abby returns to the apartment building and taps on Owen's bedroom window, asking to be let in. Owen is almost asleep but he tells her to come in. Abby removes her bloody clothes and crawls into bed with him. Owen asks her whether she'd like to go steady with him, and Abby replies ""I'm not a girl."" That doesn't seem to bother Owen, so they decide to go steady. The next morning, Abby returns to her own apartment, but she leaves a note for Owen that reads, I must be gone and live or stay and die .One afternoon on a school outing to a local pond for some ice skating, Kenny, Mark, and Donald again confront Owen with a warning that they are going to push him into an ice hole. This time, however, Owen stands up for himself and takes a swipe at Kenny's head with a big stick, causing his ear to bleed. At the same time, some other students have noticed a body frozen in the ice. The police are called, and the body is cut free.Later that afternoon, after school is out, Owen brings Abby to a secret room in the basement of the apartment building. When Abby asks why they're there, Owen pulls out a knife and cuts his finger, offering to mix bloods with her. Watching Owen's blood drip on the floor, Abby can no longer stand the hunger that she's experiencing now that Father is no longer providing her with blood. She falls to the floor and begins to lap up Owen's blood. She finally transforms into her true vampire image with white cataract eyes, unappealing facial warts, and sharp teeth. Abby hisses at Owen to go away; when he doesn't, she runs off herself. Overcome with bloodlust, Abby jumps on the next person who walks by... Virginia (Sasha Barrese). Fortunately, Virginia's boyfriend Larry (Dylan Kenin) is able to kick Abby off before she kills Virginia. Unfortunately for Virginia, Larry's save only means that Virginia is doomed to become a vampire herself. She notices the change the next morning, after being transfused with six pints of blood. She wakes up, starts to drink her own blood from her arm, and bursts into flames when the nurse opens the curtains.A wimp he might be, but Owen is not a dummy. He has figured out that Abby is a vampire and confronts her at her apartment that evening. When he asks her if she is a vampire, she does not seem to understand the word and she only replies: ""I need blood to live"". He asks her how old she really is. Like before, she admits to being 12 but says that she's been 12 for a long time. He asks the whereabouts of her dad, and she says that he wasn't really her father. Owen finds an old photo of Abby and Father, taken when Father was about 12 years old. Abby looks just the same as she does now. Concerned about what she might do to him, Owen goes home. Later, as he's about to sit down to the pot pie left for him by his mother, Abby knocks on the door. She requests to be invited in, but Owen stalls. He asks her what would happen if he didn't invite her. Silently, Abby walks in uninvited. Almost immediately, her skin begins to bleed. Owen quickly invites her in and gives her a hug. After showering, Abby changes into one of his mother's old dresses. When Owen's mom unexpectedly comes home, Abby immediately scampers across the window from Owen's apartment to hers, even though it's two stories up.The next morning, Owen finds a note from Abby asking him whether he would like to hang out with her that evening. Meanwhile, based on Larry's description of Virginia's attacker, the Detective has traced Abby to her apartment. He breaks in and finds her asleep in the bathtub. Because he can't see in the dark, he rips open the foil covering the windows. Immediately, Abby's skin begins to crack when it is exposed to the sunlight. Owen, who was in the apartment waiting for Abby to wake up, screams ""NO!"" giving Abby sufficient time to jump on the Detective and drink his blood. As he lays dying, the Detective reaches out to Owen for help, but Owen closes the bathroom door and leaves him to his fate. After feeding, Abby informs him that she must go away before the rest of the police show up looking for the detective. That night, Owen looks out the window to see Abby getting into a taxi to move away.After Abby is gone, Owen returns to his normal boring routine of going to school and going home. One evening, he is about to start swimming lessons with Mr. Zoric (Ritchie Coster). As he gets into his swimsuit and begins his lesson, Kenny, Mark, and Donald start a fire in the dumpster behind the gym, forcing Mr. Zoric to leave the pool area unattended. When Mr. Zoric goes to put out the fire, they lock him out of the gym and go back into the pool where Kenny's older brother Jimmy (Brett DelBuono) has kicked everyone out of the pool and made Owen get back in. Jimmy gives Owen an ultimatum: either stay under water for three minutes or have one of his eyes poked out... Owen's eye for Kenny's ear. Then Jimmy pushes Owen under. A minute passes. Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out in the gym. From his underwater point of view, Owen hears bullies screaming, then Jimmy's severed head falls into the water, followed by more body parts. An almost drowned Owen surfaces and crawls out of the water. He looks up to see Abby's bloody feet standing beside him. She had apparently crashed into the pool area through a skylight window and in a matter of seconds bit, torn, beheaded, dismembered and disemboweled all four bullies to save Owen.Epilogue. Owen sits on a train traveling towards an unknown destination. Snow is falling outside. A large trunk sits in front of him. From inside the basket comes a rapping. Owen raps back in Morse Code and then takes a bite from a Now & Later. It is clear at this point that Owen has become Abby's new protector and handler, and they are traveling to find a new life for themselves."

As Jonah prepares to leave the next morning, Grasss men burst in and tell Jonah that he is being conscripted into the nations service to track down Turnbull. Realizing his family is still unavenged, Jonah accepts. Elsewhere, Turnbull and Burke retrieve the main component of the nation killing weapon, an orange chemical orb developed by Eli Whitney in service of the Union.Grass tells Jonah all that is known of Turnbulls plans but explains that the trail went dead because their informant died. Resurrecting the informant with his powers, Jonah learns that the man hadnt been recruited by Turnbull, but by Colonel Slocum (Tom Wopat), another associate of Jonahs who betrayed his family. Jonah pays Slocum a visit at an illegal death match pavilion run by Doc Cross Williams (Michael Shannon). Slocum is corrupt and sarcastically tells Jonah to ask Turnbulls dead son, Jeb, where his father is. Jonah throws Slocum into the fighting ring where the gladiator, a bestial, snakelike creature, attacks and kills him.Jonah rides to Gettysburg where he spends the night digging up Jeb Turnbull (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and revives his corpse. After a brief confrontation, Jonah apologizes for killing Jeb during the Civil War. In return, Jeb tells Jonah about Fort Resurrection and then returns to the afterlife. Jonah then buys some new weaponry from Smith (Lance Reddick), a gunsmith, in preparation for battle. Smith points out that Jonahs hatred of the Union isnt born out of Southern loyalty but out of a stubbornness to adhere to the rules of government.Jonah goes to the fort and encounters Turnbull but doesnt get a chance to kill him. Jonah gets shot several times after a fight with Burke but is able to escape. As Jonah nears death and imagines what it would be like to fight Turnbull, his dog drags him to his Native American allies who perform a ceremony that heals Jonah. Back on his feet, he relays a message to Washington about Turnbulls plan to destroy the capital. Afterwards, Turnbull tells Burke to find what Jonah loves and bring it to him as bait for Jonah; Burke kidnaps Lilah from the brothel.Jonah sneaks through the dock where Turnbulls Confederate ironclad is being readied for the attack. Burke attacks him and the two discreetly fight until Jonah shoves Burke headfirst into the boat motor, then utterly destroys him by burning him up. Jonah prepares to shoot Turnbull but Turnbull holds Lilah at gunpoint and forces Jonah to surrender. Turnbull chains Jonah and Lilah in the ship's hold and tells Jonah that he wants him to watch as the Union is destroyed. Lilah picks her handcuffs and frees Jonah, who goes after Turnbull. Lt. Grasss monitor warship engages Turnbulls but is destroyed with the Nation Killer. Jonah and Turnbull fight and fall into the engine room. Turnbull gains the upper hand and gives the order to destroy the city. As the preliminary weapons are fired, laying the preparation for the explosive trigger, Jonah uses his tomahawk to jam the cannon. He then brutally beats Turnbull and traps his neck in a gear before saving Lilah. The pair jump into the water just as the chemical orb ignites in the engine room, killing Turnbull and all his men.The next day, Grant rewards Jonah with a job offer as sheriff of the United States. Jonah refuses, but assures the President that if they need him, theyll be able to find him."
Blue Valentine,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1120985/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The relationship of a contemporary married couple, charting their evolution over a span of years by cross-cutting between time periods. Dean Pereira and Cindy Heller Pereira are a young working-class married couple with a young daughter, Frankie. Dean currently works as a painter and Cindy is a nurse at a medical clinic. Despite their relatively tender ages, they are both ravaged by the life they've eked out together and by the experiences they've had leading into their marriage. High-school dropout Dean comes from a broken home and never really had a mother figure; he never imagined getting married or having a family despite falling in love with Cindy at first sight. He has no professional ambition beyond his current work--which he enjoys since he feels he can down a beer at 8AM and it won't affect his work--although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life. Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family; her parents didn't set an example of a harmonious married or family life. One of her previous serious partners, Bobby Ontario, has had a profound effect on many aspects of her marriage to Dean. Dean and Cindy head off on an overnight getaway together without Frankie, seeking a clearer picture of whether their marriage can survive its many issues.—Huggo No one said that marriage would be easy, but easygoing middle-aged house-painter Dean has come up with the perfect plan to save his already-strained relationship with his nurse wife Cindy. For their daughter Frankie's sake, they must make it work instead of watching their tattered life and deteriorating marriage dismantle before their very eyes. How did it all start? When did Dean and Cindy's youthful passion and sacred vows of eternal love and devotion give way to misery, broken promises, and the end of intimacy? Above all, how can two ardent lovers grow apart?—Nick Riganas The film depicts a married couple, Dean Pereira (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy Heller (Michelle Williams), shifting back and forth in time between their courtship and the dissolution of their marriage several years later.Present Day: The film begins with a little girl (Frankie) calling for her lost dog, Megan. After the dog doesn't return she goes inside to find her Daddy, who is asleep in a chair in the living room. She wakes him, and they go outside to find Megan the dog. They spend a few minutes searching for her. You can tell right away that they have a wonderful relationship and that Frankie loves her father with all her heart. After a few minutes, they go inside to wake up Cindy, they jump on her bed in what seems to be a nice family moment. Cindy seems slightly cranky and insists she gets to sleep for a while longer. They get her up and begin to eat breakfast. Cindy is clearly the parent who enforces the rules while Dean is the fun one. Cindy tries to get Frankie to eat her breakfast (cold oatmeal with raisins), but Frankie doesn't comply until Dean takes the fun approach of eating on the table like leopards. Cindy, frustrated, takes Frankie out of the room and gets her ready for school. Cindy and Frankie are in the car, and Dean brings out Frankie's backpack and asks Cindy to buckle her seat-belt, to which she waves off with annoyance.
Dean goes to work as a home painter and Cindy as a nurse in a pre-natal private practice. Her boss asks if she has made the decision to move to another city with his practice. She remarks that hasn't had the time to discuss it with her family yet, and her boss looks disappointed, but tells her to let him know by Monday. After her shift, she rushes to Frankie's school to see her in an assembly. Along the way, she sees Megan dead on the side of the road. When she arrives at Frankie's assembly, she sits next to Dean who can tell something is wrong right away. She says that she found Megan and begins to cry. Dean is upset and asks how many times he has to ask her to lock the dog gate before she gets it. After the assembly, they take Frankie to a sleepover at Cindy's Dad's house. Her father asks is anything is wrong, she doesn't respond. Dean and Cindy say goodnight to Frankie and go home. When they arrive they bury Megan and Cindy begins to clean the house while Dean watches home movies of Frankie and Megan. Dean then calls a cheap hotel for them to spend a night together. Cindy says she is on call tomorrow and doesn't have the time to go away for the evening. Dean is ardent about them spending the night together, she relents, and they head out. While stopping to get gas and booze Cindy runs into an old boyfriend, named Bobby. He asks if she is married and if she has been faithful to him. Cindy says yes and leaves. In the car, Dean asks what took her so long. She says that he will never guess who she ran into. When she reveals it was Bobby, Dean freaks out. Cindy tries to calm him by lying and saying that Bobby is fat and ugly, but that does nothing for Dean.Flashback. We meet Dean six or seven years earlier. He is a charismatic slacker who is applying for a job at a moving company. He talks about love and romance with his co-workers, saying that men are more romantic than women. Women dream about meeting Prince Charming and end up choosing a man because he is safe and has a good job. Dean says, ""men just know by looking at women that they are the one"". He says that it is like listening to music; sometimes you hear a song, and you just got to dance to it. One day Dean and his crew help move an old gentleman into a nursing home. His boss says Dean doesn't have a lot of time to unpack the items into the room and to hurry up. As Dean goes through he boxes, he sees the remnants of an amazing life. He takes the time to unpack everything and decorate the room with old matchboxes on the wall, the man's navy uniform, and photos from his past. When the old man comes to the room, Dean helps him in and puts him in a rocking chair and shows him the work he has done. The old man is a little overwhelmed but clearly appreciates what Dean has done for him. Dean then goes to take his part of the payment which his boss left for him on a table, but before he leaves he looks out the door and sees something...Flashback. We meet Cindy six or seven years earlier. She is in a wheelchair making her way around a college campus. She goes to the campus athletic center and watches some wrestlers. One of them looks up and comes out to see her, and he is Bobby. He kisses her and asks why she is in a wheelchair and she says that she is seeing how accessible the campus is to paraplegics. He asks why she is always doing things like this and calls her a freak and continues to kiss her. She pulls away and says that she will see him later. A little later, Bobby is having sex with Cindy from behind, and he is very rough with her. She tries to go away for a second, but he goes even harder. Finally, she gets away to the bathroom where she attempts to pull a broken condom out of herself. A few days later we see Cindy taking care of her elderly grandmother. Cindy brings her back from a walk to a nursing home and settles her down into her room. She goes to close the door when she sees across the hall to a neighbor's room and sees Dean taking his share of the money from the old man. Dean sees her spying on him and come out to her room and insists that he wasn't stealing the money. Cindy nods but doesn't believe him. Dean says that it was his pay for the day and asks for her name and what she is doing later that night. She doesn't reply, and he writes his name on the back of his business card and asks her to give him a chance. She smiles, takes the card, and closes the door.Present Day. Cindy and Dean arrive at the hotel and are in a futuristic room complete with a rotating bed. Cindy gets in the shower. Dean joins her and attempts to go down on her. She pulls away, and they finish showering in silence. Later, while eating dinner, Cindy asks why Dean why he never took the initiative with work. He is upset that she isn't happy with where he is, and that working as a house painter allows him to do the job he loves most, being a husband and father. She drops the issue and they finish eating.Flashback. After a month of not hearing from Cindy, Dean begins to lose all hope. One day while sweeping out a moving truck he finds a locket that belonged to the old man in the nursing home. That gives him the excuse to go back to the home to hopefully see Cindy. When he arrives at the home the old man's room is cleaned out, and his blankets are folded on the bed. Disappointed that the old man died, Dean sees Cindy's grandmother in her room and asks about that girl who was in her room with her a while back. Cindy's Grandma says her name is Cindy, and she is her granddaughter. Dean leaves and take the bus home. On the bus, he sees Cindy and goes to sit with her and the two talk, joke, and get along quite well. Their time on the bus extends to an impromptu date where he sings for her while she tap dances. You can see that already they are in love.Present Day. Back in the hotel room Dean and Cindy are both getting drunk, and he tries to make love to her but she pretends to fall asleep. Frustrated he walks away. She follows him, and they fool around on the floor. He begins to get naked and asks her to make a baby with him, but she stops him and tries to make him play rape her. He says that he loves her and won't do that to her. She gets angry, walks out, and locks the door to the bedroom so he cannot follow her. He pounds on the door saying that he will never hit or treat her like that, that he loves her, and that it isn't right of her to treat him like this after all he has done for her. He just wants to make a baby with her.Flashback. We see Cindy in a classroom while Bobby collects the classes papers. He pauses at her desk, and she ignores him. Angry, he takes her paper and walks away. After class, she goes to the bathroom and takes a pregnancy test. We can tell by her face that it is positive. She finds Dean after work and they go for a walk. They come to a bridge and after nagging her the whole time about what is bothering her Dean threatens to jump over the bridge. Cindy will not tell him what is wrong until his is over the side and ready to jump. When he hears of her pregnancy, he asks if it is his and she says that it is doubtful. Angry he starts hitting the fence of the bridge, she starts to walk away, but he follows her and asks what she plans to do (abort/adopt/keep) and she says nothing. Dean says he loves her and that he will support her no matter what she chooses. The movie cuts to Cindy at an abortion clinic answering questions (when did you begin having sex? How many partners? Etc...), she then goes into the room to have an abortion, the doctor is ready to administer the procedure when Cindy stops him saying she cannot go though with it and she wants to see her friend. She walks out of the clinic and Dean follows her, you can't hear what they are saying but he mouths ""I love you"" and she nods and he holds her while she cries. Cindy goes home smiling, lays on her bed, and listens to her missed messages. They are from Bobby who says he knows she is pregnant, that the baby is his, and that he is going to beat Dean to a pulp if shes doesn't call and take him back. Cindy tries to call Dean at work but while she is calling Bobby and two of his wrestling buddies find Dean and beat him pretty badly. Later Dean goes to meet Cindy's parents. Cindy's father asks if he graduated from high school and he says no, but that he loves Cindy and will do what it takes to support her. Cindy's mother says that Cindy is going to become a Doctor and Dean says that he loves that and thinks she is the smartest person he knows. He says he would like to have her as his or his kid's doctor someday. After dinner Cindy and Dean go up to her room and fool around. Before things get serious, Dean says he picked a song for them. He plays it and asks her to marry him, she agrees.Present Day. The next day in the hotel Cindy's phone rings and her job asks her to come in to work. She tries to get out of it but she is their last hope. She gets dressed and writes Dean a note explaining where she went and that he will have to take a bus home. Dean wakes up, angry that Cindy left him there like some drunk and makes his way to her place of work. Cindy's boss asks again if she thought about transferring with him. She says it has only been a day and she thought she had until Monday to decide. Her boss says that he could get her an apartment where she could stay during the week and then come home on the weekends. Perhaps, he adds, they could even get dinner together in the evenings. Cindy is shocked and reminds him that she is married and that she thought he wanted to take her with him because she is good at her job. Her boss gets flustered and goes into to see a patient.Meanwhile, Dean arrives at the hospital and the nurse at the greeting station makes a rude comment about he must be Dean, he says he is just here to see his wife. The nurse calls Cindy who is upset that he came to visit her at work and the co-worker nurse asks Cindy if she will be alright and tells her not to let Dean brainwash her. They head to Cindy's office and Dean flies off the handle that she has been talking about them at work and leaving him at the hotel and their fight escalates into yelling. Cindy's boss and co-worker come in to try to help and Dean tells them to leave or he will hit her boss. The boss does not leave so Dean slugs him. When the boss stands back up he fires Cindy and tells both of them to get the hell out of his office. They leave, Cindy disgusted with Dean and she screams that she can't do this with him anymore and that she wants a divorce. Angry, Dean throws his wedding ring into some bushes a moment later he calms down and goes to find it. Cindy joins him in the search for his ring and they look for it in silence.During their fight in her office the movie flashes back and forth from the fight to their wedding day at the Justice of the Peace office. Cindy is 6 or 7 months pregnant and Dean tells her how beautiful she looks. She asks if he is nervous, and he says that he is nervous they won't get in fast enough and that Cindy will change her mind. She laughs at the thought and kisses him to reassure him of her decision. We see a simple ceremony that clearly means a lot to both of them as they cry while giving their vows and kissing each other as man and wife.Present Day. Cindy and Dean arrive at her father's house to pick up Frankie who is excited to see them both. Cindy hands Frankie to Dean and heads inside. Dean hands Frankie to her Grandpa, goes inside, and locks the door so they cannot follow them in. In her fathers kitchen Cindy says that she is serious about the divorce. Dean pleads with her to reconsider and says that she is being selfish and isn't thinking about Frankie and that even though she isn't his daughter he still loves her like one and that he will do anything she wants. He asks Cindy to tell him what to do and he will do it to be with them, he will do whatever she wants. Cindy says that she is thinking about Frankie and that she has fallen out of love with Dean and she cannot pretend anymore. They will never change to be what the other person needs and she just needs her space. Dean realizing this is it, leaves. Frankie chases after Dean calling for her daddy. Dean turns to her and says she must go back to her mother, Frankie just puts her arms around his neck. Dean lifts her up and gives her a big hug as Cindy comes up to them. Dean hands Frankie back to Cindy and walks away while Frankie cries out ""DADDY! DADDY!"" and Cindy turns to go back to her father's house, leaving Dean to walk away and out of hers and Frankie's lives forever.****I don't agree that he ""walks out of their lives forever."" Dean said she made a promise, ""for better or worse."" He said, ""well, this is my worse."" Dean said he would do anything, just tell him what to do and he will do it. Cindy agreed she made a vow to him and she was sorry. Dean said he would change, but she has to give him a chance to change. She nodded. By now, he has calmed down. He went over to hug her and she resisted, but she allowed him to hug her.You can tell that he is patient, loving and sincere about wanting to keep his family intact and make changes in his life, and that she acknowledges this, but isn't sure. I think she resists him, not because she doesn't love him, but because the relationship is not growing and he is caught up in a life that is going nowhere: drinking, low ambition and petty jealousies. Dean is a good, honest person, but he is very immature and my guess is, she doesn't want to raise 2 children. She wants a man, and he's still very much a child, emotionally.We cut away to their wedding day and their kiss, a very long kiss, but it shows how deeply in love they were. When we flash forward and see them today, she is hugging him with both arms, fully. She obviously still loves him, very much. At that point, she asked Dean to please, just give her space. And wanting to save his marriage and family, he fully complies with her request.THAT'S why he walked out. Not forever. I don't think he would walk out on Frankie forever. That was never implied. We don't know how it turned out and there are several ways it could have ended. They, very well, may have gotten a divorce, but he would never abandon his daughter because HE was abandoned by his mother. And Cindy would certainly not let that pig, Bobby, raise Frankie, or even ever find out she was his. No, Dean was Frankie's father.They may have gotten back together under certain circumstances, like he got counseling, stopped drinking, bettered himself, got his HS diploma, etc. By her reaction to him, and by her saying, ""give me some space,"" it is evident she is going to think about things more fully and she has not made a final decision. At the same time, he may move forward with trying to better himself on his own, which would mean a lot to Cindy. It is apparent that if he is sincere, and goes through with making some changes, she will probably take him back.So, to say he ""walks out on them forever"" is just your opinion and another possibility, albeit, a very unlikely one. On purpose, the writer left us with an ending to the movie that was vague; an ending we are to decide for ourselves. Think of ""Gone With the Wind."" We don't know if there will be a happy ending, but there is a small glimmer of hope left there for us to use in any way we choose. tday, 4/7/12"

However, MacGruber is still very much alive and has dropped out of western society to recover emotionally from Casey's murder, recover which he knows he will never be able to do. Colonel Jim Faith is able to locate MacGruber and coerce him out of retirement as MacGruber's arch enemy, Dieter von Cunth, who is thought to be Casey's murderer, has stolen a nuclear warhead, his intended use of it unknown.

Britain, A.D. 117. Quintus Dias, the sole survivor of a Pictish raid on a Roman frontier fort, marches north with General Virilus' legendary Ninth Legion, under orders to wipe the Picts from the face of the Earth and destroy their leader, Gorlacon.—Anonymous AD 117. The Roman Empire stretches from Egypt to Spain, and East as far as the Black Sea. But in northern Britain, the relentless onslaught of conquest has ground to a halt in face of the guerrilla tactics of an elusive enemy: the savage and terrifying Picts. Quintus Dias (Fassbender), sole survivor of a Pictish raid on a Roman frontier fort, marches north with General Virilus' (West) legendary Ninth Legion, under orders to wipe the Picts from the face of the earth and destroy their leader Gorlacon. But when the legion is ambushed on unfamiliar ground, and Virilus taken captive, Quintus faces a desperate struggle to keep his small platoon alive behind enemy lines.

However, can they escape the silent enemy's trap?—Nick Riganas It is A.D. 117 and the Roman garrisons are struggling to contain the Picts, the Celtic inhabitants of the Scottish Highlands. The Picts under their king, Gorlacon, are perfecting guerilla warfare and are eliminating Roman outposts one by one. Centurion Quintus Dias is the only survivor of a Pictish raid and is taken prisoner. In the meantime, the Roman governor of Britannia wants to obtain favour with the central administration, hoping to secure a transfer back to the comforts of Rome. He dispatches the Ninth Legion to the front under General Titus Flavius Virilus, providing him with a mute female Brigantian scout, Etain.As the legion marches north, they encounter and save Dias, who has escaped. Etain betrays the legion to Gorlacon: the Romans walk into a trap and are annihilated. Dias, with six others, elude death and capture. They learn that Virilus has been taken prisoner and set out to rescue him. They find the Pictish settlement and sneak in at night, but fail to break the general's chains. As they retreat, one of them kills Gorlacon's young son. The next morning, after the dead boy is burned, the general is given a sword and made to duel with Etain, who kills him.The seven decide to return south via a long detour over the mountains, while Etain with a Pict detachment are sent on horseback to track and kill them, in revenge for the king's son. They eventually catch up with the fugitives, who have to jump off a cliff and into a stream. One is killed by arrows while two separate, pursued by wolves. Dias and his best fighter attempt a night raid on the Pictish camp, while Etain and her warriors do the same. Several men are killed. Dias and his two followers happen upon a hut in the forest and befriend Arianne, who lives there. She shelters them and when Etain comes, she confronts her while the Romans hide under the floorboards. The next morning they leave Arianne and find the closest garrison abandoned: an order on a wall informs them that Roman troops have retreated south, to Hadrian's Wall. As they see Etain approach, they set up a trap inside the fort. A battle ensues, Dias kills Etain, and he and one wounded companion emerge victorious. By chance they reunite with one of their lost companions, who earlier killed Gorlacon's son, and wounded another Roman soldier to leave as bait for a pack of wolves hunting them. Upon reaching Hadrian's Wall, the lost companion worries Dias, who says that he will report his crimes and the two men fight with Dias as the victor. Dias' other companion, in Pictish clothing, is shot by Roman soldiers by mistake. When Dias enters the camp he reports the situation to the governor. The governor has decided to have all Ninth Legion veterans killed, so that his record is not tainted by a military failure. The governor's daughter is trusted with making sure that Dias is also killed. Dias evades the attempt on his life and returns to Arianne in the forest."

Eventually, over 8,000 were sent off to German concentration camps. As 10-year-old Sarah (Mélusine Mayance) and her family are being arrested, she hides her younger brother in a closet. After realizing she will not be allowed to go home, Sarah does whatever she can to get back to her brother. In 2009, a journalist named Julia Jarmond (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas) is on assignment to write a story on the deported Jews in 1942.

In 2009, American journalist Julia Jarmond (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas) and her French husband Bertrand Tezac (Frédéric Pierrot) plan to reform his apartment in Paris to live with their teenage daughter. Julia is assigned to write an article about the notorious deportation of French Jews to German concentration camps in 1942. During her investigation, she learns that the apartment of her husband's family belonged to Sarah's family. She becomes obsessed by Sarah's life and to find the fate of the little girl.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil It is the year 1942 in Paris, France. The scene opens with a young girl playing with her brother in a bedroom. The two children are laughing and having fun together when several sharp knocks sound on the front door of the apartment. The girl, Sarah Starzynski (Mélusine Mayance) immediately quiets down. Sarah and her mother, Madame Starzynski (Natasha Mashkevich), go to the front door and and are greeted by two French policemen. They are able to see Sarah and her mother, but they do not see or hear her brother or her father. Sarah says that both her father and her brother have been missing for several days, but inside she knows that her brother is in the bedroom.Sarah rushes back to the bedroom where her brother is and tells him to hide in a closet, despite his protests. The boy reluctantly climbs in after Sarah tells him that it is just like the game that they played before, and that she will be back soon. Sarah locks the door, then takes the key, holding it tightly in her hand. Sarah and her mother are then arrested by the officers. On their way out of the alleyway, they bump into Sarah's father, M. Starzynski (Arben Bajraktaraj, and the officers arrest him as well.Sarah's family, except for her brother, are all loaded into trucks to be taken to the Velodrome d'Hiver, where many other arrested Jews are also kept in unsanitary, dim and generally inhuman conditions by the Paris police force and the French Secret Service. While there, Sarah's family meets another woman. The family and the woman are having a conversation about what is happening when the woman pricks her gums, starts violently coughing so she can attempt to find a way out. Mme. Starzynski, panicked, calls for a doctor. The woman reports that she is coughing blood up. A nurse takes her away to the infirmary. From their vantage point, Sarah and her family are able to see the woman enter the infirmary, come out with several papers, then leave the Velodrome after presenting said papers to the guards. M. Starzynski, stunned, yells at the guards to stop her so he could give her the closet key. The guards refuse, and instead slam a gun butt in his head, dazing him. He is then told to stand up and go back to the area in the Velodrome where he came from.The deportees are then transferred to the French Beaune-la-Rolande containment camp. This was not a concentration camp, and the purpose was not to force labor or to kill the inmates. There is strict order that men are to go to one side, and that women and children are to go to other side. M. Starzynski is separated from his family. He says that he will see them soon. He is never seen again.Later, the women and the children are split from each other. There is much reluctance to do so, and many mothers protest, holding on to their children, and their children doing the same. Mme. Starzynski and Sarah are separated, but when Mme. Starzynski attempts to run and get Sarah, complete pandemonium ensues. The French guards are unable to restore order without resorting to physical force. The guards use their guns to hit the inmates to separate them. When Mme. Starzynski finds Sarah, the two sit on the ground, hoping. Suddenly, a French guard uses a powerful stream of water to separate them.Later in the day, there is commotion as the children crowd around a portion of barbed wire. The women of the camp are trying to hand the children fruits and bread, much to the guards amusement. Sarah notices an apple fall from a woman's hand to the ground. As she reaches for the apple, one of the guards steps on the apple to prevent Sarah from getting at it. Sarah looks at the guard sympathetically, and he releases his foot from the apple, allowing Sarah to take it. This is the last time that the women will ever be seen.The children are now on their own in the camp. Sarah comes down with a fever, and she falls asleep for three days. She awakens to another girl sitting on her bunk in the barrack, who informs her that she has been sick for a while. Sarah suddenly remembers the key, but she cannot find it. As she is looking, the other girl pulls out the key from her pocket and asks Sarah if she is looking for it. Sarah grabs the key as the other girl introduces herself as Rachel (Sarah Ber). Sarah secretively explains to Rachel that she locked her brother in a closet to avoid having the French police find him, and that she must get back to Paris to let him out. The two girls agree to go with each other, and escape. They sit in the barrack, contemplating the best way to do it.The two girls eventually decide to escape during the day. They figure that when the sun is out, it will be hot and the guards will be in the shade. Sarah remembers seeing a small ditch under a portion of barbed wire. If they were to escape at night, the guards would notice any movement, and they have searchlights. Sarah tells Rachel to layer up with as many sweaters as she can. When Rachel questions this logic, Sarah explains that the barbed wire around the camp will hurt less when they crawl under it.The two girls hatch their plan, sneaking out of the barracks in broad daylight. It is sweltering hot outside. Like they expected, all of the guards are in the shade, and are avoiding looking in the sun. The two girls run over to the barbed wire, in their sweaters. Sarah finds the ditch, and lifts the barbed wire over it so that Rachel can escape. When Rachel is about halfway through the wire, a large shadow appears, from the guard. Both of the girls look up at him. The guard announces that escaping is against the rules. Sarah looks at the guard and quietly says his name, Jacques. The officer, stunned, asks how Sarah knows his name. Sarah remembers when the officer released the apple for her, and shortly after, heard someone say his name. She is able to break the officer by saying that she will never forget him for what he has done. The officer, emotional, looks around, then lifts up the wire for the two girls to escape.The two girls run through a field of grain, then into a forest. Rachel realizes that if they are to have any chance of not getting caught, they need to remove their yellow stars, indicating that they are Jews. As night falls, the two girls look desperately for any sign of civilization. Rachel, however, is getting weak, and is not sure if she will be able to make it back to Paris. Suddenly, Sarah sees lights coming from a village, and begins running towards it. They are roaming the streets, when they see a series of military trucks. The girls rush to hide. After that, they begin roaming the streets, looking for anyone that can help them. They come across a house with the windows open. Sarah shouts, trying to gain their attention so that they can help Rachel. The man inside shuns both of the girls and slam the windows shut. The girls find the mans shed and sleep for the night.The next morning, the man comes to the shed to find the two girls sleeping. He shouts at them to scram, but Sarah explains that her friend is gravely ill. The man, hesitating, looks around and takes both of the girls to the home. Sarah introduces herself under a fake name, but Rachel is too ill to speak. The owner of the home, Jules Dufaure (Niels Arestrup) and his wife, Genevieve Dufaure (Dominique Frot), decide to call a physician to examine the girl. The physician arrives with a German officer. While the physician treats Rachel, the guard asks if there is another child, since there was recently an escape at the camp. Genevieve, knowing this might happen, had hid Sarah before the officer came. Genevieve and Jules both agree to let the officer inspect the home. As the officer begins his search, the doctor comes back, announcing that Rachel has died. The officer, distracted, follows the physician back outside. The two men leave, leaving Genevieve, Jules and Sarah in the home.Days later, the Dufaures board a train to take Sarah back to her family's apartment in Paris. The Dufaures, not wanting trouble for having one of the escapees, dress Sarah in boy's clothes to avoid detection, and Jules creates fake identification papers for Sarah. When an officer comes around to check the papers, Jules papers are copied well enough to fool the officer, and Sarah is allowed to continue. In Paris, Sarah rushes into the apartment building, and despite the Dufaures calls for her to be cautious, Sarah keeps running. She runs up to the third floor, knocking furiously on the apartment door. A young boy opens the door and answers; Sarah pushes him aside without explanation and finds the closet where she locked her brother. When she unlocks the cupboard, she is horrified by what she finds, and screams hysterically. The audience presumes that the boy has died.After the war, Sarah continues to live as a family member with the Dufaures and their two grandsons. When she turns 18, she moves to the United States, hoping to put everything that happened behind her. She stops corresponding with the Dufaures when she gets married and has a son, William. When her son is nine, Sarah still despondent and blaming herself for her brother's death commits suicide by driving her car into the path of an oncoming truck. It's explained to her son that her death was an accident.The movie cuts to the present day, 2009.

Julia, having done an article on the French roundup of Jews, finds herself craving more about the history of the apartment, especially since she learns that the apartment came into her husband's family at about the time of the French roundup, and she begins to investigate the people involved in the ownership of that apartment unit.Julia begins an obsessive quest to find any trace of Sarah, eventually learning of her life in Brooklyn and finally locating William Rainsford (Aidan Quinn) in Italy, after extensive reasoning revealed that his grandmother was in fact Sarah Starzynski. She meets with him in Florence, Italy, and asks him for information about his mother, but learns to her surprise that William does not know his mother's history or even that she was a Jew, believing only that she had been a French farm girl. Listening in amazement, William rejects the story and dismisses Julia. Later, everything is confirmed to William by his dying father, Richard, including Sarah's suicide. He gives William Sarah's journals and notes, telling him Sarah immediately had William baptized right after his birth, fearing that ""being Jewish"" was a threat to him and explaining that ""...we're all a product of our history."" The key to the cupboard is among the items handed to him by his father.Julia, having given up hope of having another child after years of unsuccessful attempts to conceive with her ex-husband, Bertrand Tezac (Frédéric Pierrot), discovers she's pregnant. Her husband loves their life with their 12-year-old daughter, Zoe, as it is and does not want to have another child at this point in life. Julia ultimately decides against an abortion, has another daughter, divorces her husband and eventually moves with her new baby daughter to New York City.Two years later, William, having contacted Julia, meets her for a late lunch in a restaurant favored by Sarah and gives her additional information about his mother that the Dufaures had. Julia is amazed and happy for him, and has brought her young daughter along to the meeting. William breaks into tears when Julia tells him her daughter's name is Sarah. Julia comforts him as they both look at little Sarah."
Barney's Version,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1423894/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The picaresque and touching story of the politically incorrect, fully lived life of the impulsive, irascible and fearlessly blunt Barney Panofsky. Take a ride through the life and memories of Barney Panofsky, a hard-drinking, cigar-smoking, foulmouthed 65-year old hockey fanatic and television producer, as he reflects on his life's successes and (numerous) gaffes and failures as the final chapters of his own existence come sharply into focus.—Production In Montreal, Barney Panofsky produces a long-running soap. He has two grown children and an ex-wife, now in New York City with her second husband. Barney hopes to win her back. A nasty cop has just published a book accusing Barney of murder some years ago. In flashbacks we see a young Barney and friends in Rome, where an early affair ends in tragedy. In Canada, he courts and marries his second wife - and at the reception, he meets another woman he decides is the one. He seeks advice from his dad, an ex-cop. Can Barney win back his ex-wife, and what about the murder?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> In Montreal, the bitter and unpleasant television producer Barney Panofsky recalls his marriages. In 1974, in Rome, his unbalanced girlfriend Clara 'Chambers' Charnofsky gets pregnant and Barney marries her. On the delivery, he learns that the stillborn baby is not his and he leaves Clara that commits suicide later. Then his uncle invites Barney to move to Montreal to work as television producer. In 1975, Barney gets married with his second wife, the daughter of a wealthy Jewish couple. During the wedding party, Barney is infatuated by the guest Miriam Grant (Rosamund Pike). Miriam does not believe in love at the first sight and rejects the flowers and gifts that Barney sends to her in New York. One day, Barney surprises his best friend Boogie shagging his wife and they divorce. He travels to New York to meet Miriam; they return to Montreal, get married and have two children. After many years living happily together, Miriam meets the radio producer Blair in their house by the lake and Barney, who drinks a lot and smokes cigars, feels jealous. Blair offers an opportunity to Miriam in New York and Barney gets drunken and has one night stand with a former actress, destroying their marriage. Later Barney shows signs of dementia, loosing his memory. But he never forgets his beloved Miriam.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The adult life of Barney Panofsky, the Montréal-based producer of the long running soap opera ""O'Malley of the North"", is presented over the course of what end up being three failed marriages starting from 1975 to present day. Barney being able to attract three wives is despite many people in his life considering him, in polite terms, being a bit of a schmuck. The first marriage, which takes place when he is living in Rome, ends up being one partly out of circumstance, that circumstance which was not completely accurate to what he knew. The second marriage is to a stereotypical Jewish princess, who liked to tell the world more than anything about obtaining a Masters degree from McGill. Beyond their basic incompatibility, this second marriage is doomed to failure in part because of her extremely wealthy father looking down on Barney and Barney's own father, retired police detective Izzy Panofsky, and in part because of Barney's own fixation on two other items at their wedding besides her. The third marriage is to who Barney would arguably consider the love of his life and the woman for who he would do anything. But his own insecurities may be the largest cause of the break-up of that marriage. The individual effect of Barney's three closest buddies - Boogie, Leo and Cedric - on his marriages is also shown.—Huggo"

Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's acclaimed play, Incendies tells the powerful and moving tale of two young adults' voyage to the core of deep-rooted hatred, never-ending wars and enduring love.—Mylène Chollet Canadian Nawal Marwan has just passed away. The only people at the reading of her will are her twin adult children, Jeanne and Simon Marwan, and the executor, Nawal's long time employer and friend, notary Jean Lebel. The will contains many unusual requests, the most unusual being two sealed envelopes, one to be delivered by each of the twins to their father and to their brother respectively. The unusual nature of these requests are that their father as they know passed away years earlier during the war in Lebanon (where Nawal was raised) and they have no knowledge of any other offspring. Simon sees these requests as further indication that his mother was crazy and he will have no part of any of what he sees as her unusual final requests. But Jeanne wants to respect her mother's final wishes, which means finding out who their real father is and who this unknown brother is. These tasks take Jeanne on a quest to Lebanon to trace her mother's history, of which she knows little. As Jeanne goes on her quest with what little information she has on hand, she finds a history filled with turmoil. But many who knew her mother or knew of her mother refuse to speak to Jeanne. Jeanne ultimately requires Simon's assistance who reluctantly joins her in Lebanon. But even Simon gets caught up in finding out about his father and brother when they are closer to piecing together the puzzle. Finding out about their mother's past and thus their own history may enlighten them on why Nawal was the woman that she was.—Huggo In Canada, the sixty-year-old immigrant secretary Nawal Marwan passes away and the notary Jean Lebel, who had been her employer and friend for seventeen years, reads her will to her twin son and daughter Simon and Jeanne Marwan, who is a mathematician.

Then, they may put a gravestone on her tomb. Simon is reluctant to respect his mother last wishes, but Jeanne decides to find her biological father and brother. She travels to the Middle East to track down the past life of her mother and she discovers who she was before moving to Canada. She feels disturbed with the revelations and asks Simon to come to the Middle East to assist her in her journey. Simon discovers who his father and his brother are and concludes that one plus one may be equal to one.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Long-buried secrets are about to come to light, when the twin siblings, Jeanne and Simon, are called before a notary for the reading of their mother Nawal's will. Suddenly, Jeanne is to hand-deliver a sealed letter to the father she never knew, somewhere in the Middle East; likewise, Simon has to give an equally important message to an unknown brother the twins didn't know they had. One is determined to unearth the truth; the other is reluctant. However, a promise is a promise, and, unless the siblings travel to their mother's homeland, they will never find peace. Will Jeanne and Simon honour her dying wish and shed light on Nawal Marwan's terrifying life?—Nick Riganas After their mother succumbs to a stroke she suffers at a community swimming pool, twin brother and sister receive final requests in their immigrant mother's will. To fulfill her wishes, they must journey to her birthplace in an unnamed Middle-Eastern country (based on Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War).
The movie contains a series of flashbacks to the mother's life (Nawal Marwan). Nawal, a Middle-Eastern Christian is impregnated by a refugee (likely a Palestine refugee in Lebanon). Nawal's infuriated brothers kill her lover as he and Nawal try to escape. She reveals to her grandmother that she is pregnant. They keep the pregnancy secret in order to save face. Upon the baby's birth, the grandmother tattoos the infant's heel, and they give the baby boy away. Nawal follows her promise to her grandmother to study in Daresh (a fictional city) during which a civil war breaks out. Under threat of war, Nawal returns to find her lost son. War has preceded her arrival as she discovers her son's orphanage at Kfar Khout has been destroyed. She then pretends to be a Muslim to board a bus with other Muslims fleeing to get to the camp where her son has been moved.
On the way to the camp her bus is attacked by armed Christians. She and a Muslim woman and her daughter survive, only to have the bus covered in gas to be burnt. Nawal escapes by showing her cross. They would not spare the woman, so Nawal claims the other woman's daughter as her own. However, the daughter runs back to the bus and is shot.
Disillusioned, Nawal joins a radical organization. She is planted as a French tutor for a prominent Christian leader and assassinates him. She is sent to Kfar Ryat prison for 15 years, and as prisoner number 72, despite all efforts of her captors, she remains resolute and becomes known as ""The Woman Who Sings"". Before her release, her enraged captors call upon the torture specialist Abou Tareq to break her spirit and stop her singing. He rapes her repeatedly and she gives birth to twins in the jail. A nurse secretly saves the babies and returns them to Nawal after her release. Nawal emigrates to Canada with the twins.
Upon her death, Nawal leaves a will requesting that her children, Simon and Jeanne, find their father and lost brother. Simon refuses, but Jeanne continues on her own, following in her mother's footsteps. She finds her extended family. They refuse to speak to Jeanne because of the shame her mother brought on the family. She then finds the prison and learns from a former employee that her mother was tortured and gave birth in prison. He gives her the name of the nurse who assisted Nawal during childbirth.
Distraught, she calls Simon to join her. He arrives with their mother's former employer from Canada. They find the nurse and ask about the baby who was born in prison. The nurse reveals their mother gave birth to twins, Janaan and Sarwan whom she safeguarded.
A local notary identifies the name of their lost half-brother as Nihad of May. They trace the warlord who conducted the revenge attack on Kfar Khout and destroyed the orphanage. Simon learns that the warlord had spared the children and took them in and trained them to fight alongside them. Nihad becomes a sniper and searches for his mother. He becomes crazed with war but is refused the chance to become a martyr by the warlord. He returns to Daresh as a sniper and is eventually captured by the enemy. They turn him to their side and train him to be a prison torturer. He is sent to the Kfar Ryat prison where Simon's mother was held. The warlord reveals that Nihad adopts the name Abou Tareq.
Having discovered that their father is their half-brother, they find out that he too had moved to Canada. They find him, and deliver the letters from their motherone for the father and one for the son. We learn that after many years living in Canada, while swimming in a pool, Nawal had spotted a man with a tattooed heel. She approaches him and although he does not recognise her, she realises upon seeing his face that he was also her rapist in prison. She suffers a stroke from the shock and eventually dies, giving instructions to her employer, a notary, about the letters and instructions for her children.

Should she fail to track her father down, Ree Dolly, her younger siblings, and their disabled mother will soon be rendered homeless. Set in the Ozarks, a teenager, Ree Dolly, effectively has to fend for herself and look over her two younger siblings due to her parents neglecting the family. When she discovers that they are now at risk of losing their house due to the actions of her father she sets out to find him and save their home.—grantss With an absent father and a withdrawn and depressed mother, 17 year-old Ree Dolly keeps her family together in a dirt poor rural area. She's taken aback however when the local Sheriff tells her that her father put up their house as collateral for his bail and unless he shows up for his trial in a week's time, they will lose it all. She knows her father is involved in the local drug trade and manufactures crystal meth, but everywhere she goes the message is the same: stay out of it and stop poking your nose in other people's business. She refuses to listen, even after her father's brother, Teardrop, tells her he's probably been killed. She pushes on, putting her own life in danger, for the sake of her family until the truth, or enough of it, is revealed.—garykmcd Living in the Ozark back country, seventeen year old Ree Dolly acts as the primary caregiver to her mentally ill mother, and her two younger siblings, twelve year old Sonny and six year old Ashlee. Her father, Jessup Dolly, is generally absent from their lives, he who earns a living primarily by running a methamphetamine lab. Without money from Jessup, Ree is barely able to make ends meet, and depends on the kindness of their neighbor, Sonya, to do so. Ree learns that her father is scheduled for a court appearance for his illegal activities, and he has skipped bail, putting their house and property up as bond. No one seems to know where Jessup is. Ree has to try and find Jessup to make sure that he shows up for his court appearance, otherwise they risk losing their home. As Ree goes on her quest, she finds that people seem to know more about his whereabouts than they are letting on, including her uncle Teardrop of who she is scared. Rumors abound that Jessup is dead, but a dead father without a body does not help her cause. But Ree's persistence in finding out what happened to Jessup makes her come face to face with the code of silence for which some are willing to kill.—Huggo Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), 17, looks after her mentally ill mother; her brother, Sonny (12); and her sister, Ashlee (6). She daily makes sure they are fed, dressed, and off to school, and teaches them basic survival skills such as hunting and cooking. Her father, Jessup, a meth-cooker, hasn't been home for a long time and his whereabouts are unknown.The local sheriff shows up and tells Ree that Jessup is due to be in court in a week, cannot be found, and has put their house and property up as collateral for his bail. If he doesn't show up for his trial, they will lose it all. Determined to find him, dead or alive, Ree doggedly questions her father's relatives and associates, but everywhere she goes the message is the same: stay out of it or get hurt. Even her father's brother, Teardrop (John Hawkes), tells her that Jessup has probably been silenced for talking with the authorities.Undaunted, Ree pushes on and after a week, when her father does not show for his trial, Ree once again tries to speak to the region's patriarch, Thump Milton (Ronnie Hall). Because she had been warned not to return, Ree is brutally beaten by three women of the clan to teach her a lesson. When Thump and the rest of the clan show up, Ree remains defiant but pleads her case for keeping their house, saying that she is responsible for her sick mother and 2 young siblings. If her father is not found, dead or alive, the bond will be forfeited, and her family will be forced ""out into the woods."" Teardrop shows up to rescue her. He confronts Thump and the rest of the Milton clan, and assures them that he means them no harm and will take responsibility for his niece and any further actions by her. Thump is satisfied that Teardrop will not cause any problems and that he understands that whatever happened between the Milton clan and Jessup was business. Thump lets Teardrop take Ree and be on their way.On the way home, Teardrop tells Ree that if she ever finds out who killed her father, not to tell him because then he would have to do something about it and end up ""toes up"" as well. Ree sees no further options that would enable her to either keep the house or keep the family together, so she attempts to join the military after seeing recruiting posters offering $40,000 for 5 years of service. But when the recruiter tells her she will not be able to care for her family while in basic training or deployed to a foreign country, she changes her mind.One night, the same three Milton women who beat Ree come to Ree's house and offer to take her to see ""her father's bones."" They want to help her keep the house without revealing too much and without any more rumours being told about them. The women blindfold Ree so that she will not know where she is going. They drive her to a pond, get into a rowboat, and row to the shallow place where her father's body lies. They insist Ree reach into the water, grasp her father's hand, and pull it taut so that, using a chain saw, they can cut it off the corpse; for then Ree will finally be able to prove to the authorities that her father is dead. Ree agonizes, but complies; and then must help cut off her father's other hand, too.After delivering the severed hands to the sheriff--whom Teardrop has accused of being complicit in Jessup's death--Ree and her family are able to keep their home. They also also receive an unexpected boon: a large sum of cash that one of Jessup's anonymous associates had to add as part of the bond, but will not claim.The movie ends with Teardrop, after trying to play Jessup's banjo, telling Ree he realizes who killed his brother. Ree wants to give the banjo to Teardrop, but Teardrop says that she should keep it for him, and abruptly leaves. Ree's brother Sonny asks Ree if she plans on leaving them, to which she responds she would never leave them. Then her little sister picks up the banjo and starts to play it."

The Company Men,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172991/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story centers on a year in the life of three men trying to survive a round of corporate downsizing at a major company - and how that affects them, their families, and their communities. When the GTX Corporation must cut jobs to improve the company's balance sheet during the 2010 recession, thousands of employees will take the hit, like Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck). Bobby learns the real life consequences of not having a job. Not only does he see a change to his family lifestyle, and the loss of his home, but also his feelings of self-worth.—Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) An ensemble drama that addresses the effects of downsizing on the upper class American family. For high flying Bobby Walker, his lucrative job at GTX has given him the American Dream: a big house in the suburbs, a silver Porsche in his garage and a beautiful family. But when Bobby is one of the thousands laid off by his company in the wake of an ongoing recession, Bobby must join the lines of the unemployed, but also deal with the effects it has on he and his family. Among the others laid off is Phil Woodward, an executive who rose from the factory floor to the corporate offices, but is now finding himself competing with men half his age as he reenters the job market. Meanwhile, Gene McClary is the number two executive at GTX and the vocal opposition to the layoffs, as he witnesses them happening to his friends and colleagues.—robgordon GTX is a conglomerate based in Boston. In difficult economic times including what some may see as mismanagement by those in power, the company has to restructure leading to several rounds of firings, while those let go may or may not know that the company founder and CEO James Salinger is still going ahead with the plan to build a new headquarters building which would include his lavish new office. The stories of three of those fired are told, each in executive positions earning six figures, each in different levels of the executive, and each at a different stage of their life and thus career. In a changing job market than when they started working for GTX, they may have to reinvent themselves to get another job, which they may not be willing or able to do, especially if that reinvention does not afford them the lifestyle to which working for GTX has made them accustomed. Those who were fired in a later round of restructuring and thus who saw what happened to some of their colleagues let go in earlier rounds, may have a different perspective of their post GTX life.—Huggo The movie opens with Bobby arriving at work, bragging to coworkers about his golf round that morning. An onscreen news feed tells us the date is September 15, 2008. Bobby is a sales manager in ship manufacturing at GTX, a large firm in Massachusetts with multiple businesses. Shortly after arriving to work this day Bobby is fired as part of a round of corporate downsizing. His boss Phil is avoiding his own office, afraid he might also be called upstairs to get canned. Cut to a meeting involving Phil's boss, Gene, the executive over Phil and Bobby's whole division. Gene is part of a panel from the company giving answers to financial analysts about GTX's financial projections. Gene is honest in sharing his thoughts, refusing to paint a rosy picture, much to the chagrin of the other panelists. When Gene gets back to his office Phil is waiting and informs him of the layoffs. Gene was unaware the company was closing major sections of his division and firing people. Gene then interrupts the CEO, Jim, in the middle of a meeting to complain about these actions taking place without his consent or knowledge. Jim explains it was necessary but Gene does not seem placated, just resigned to the facts. A short time later Jim comes to Gene's office and briefly reminisces about old times, giving the strong impression that they have been friends for a really long time. Jim then tells Gene, nicely but firmly, that he cannot openly challenge Jim's authority in front of the other executives. There is an unspoken threat in the way Jim delivers this message to Gene. Interspersed with all the above scenes and throughout the movie are short scenes in their homes that indicate that Bobby, Phil and Gene all have very expensive homes and lavish lifestyles. We also learn that Gene's marriage is strained and he is having an affair with Sally in HR at GTX.Bobby then goes to a party at his brother-in-law Jack's home, where Jack openly needles Bobby about his corporate job. Based on their interactions it is clear they dislike each other. Next we see Bobby at the placement firm that GTX has hired to help its workers with their transition to other jobs. Bobby is openly disdainful of the process and is rude to Danny, an engineer from another company who is also in transition. Next we see Gene meet Bobby for lunch, offering to call in favors to help him land a job. Again Bobby is rude, rejecting Gene's offer because he is confident he will find employment soon. Next we see Bobby and his wife Maggie, Jack's sister, discussing their increasingly precarious financial situation. It is clear from the discussion that Bobby is in denial of how dire their circumstances really are. Exact time lines are never given but as scenes progress we are given indicators that months are passing by without progress on the job front for Bobby. He goes to an interview he thought was for a local sales job and discovers it was actually for a job in Arkansas and pays less than half his previous salary. Bobby is very rude to the interviewer and storms out cursing. During a variety of scenes we see that Bobby is becoming disillusioned with his job prospects and that Gene is becoming disillusioned with his old friend Jim and the way the company is being run. During a holiday dinner with extended family it is inadvertently revealed by Bobby's daughter that he lost his job, a fact which he and Maggie had been hiding. Jack discreetly offers Bobby a construction job with his company ""if things get tough"" but again Bobby is rude and rejects Jack's offer. Bobby continues to spend and act like things are OK but we can see his confidence eroding as months pass. Eventually, after he doesn't get a job he thought he had been offered, he shows signs of acceptance as he sells his Porsche and their home is for sale.Next we see Phil coming to Gene to complain that Sally had just fired him. When Gene goes to try and make Sally hire him back she informs him that he, too, has been fired. Gene leaves his wife and moves in with Sally. Phil is very distressed about his job loss, knowing this his prospects as an older executive competing in a very youth-oriented market are very slim. He eventually reveals to Gene that his wife makes him leave everyday with his briefcase so the neighbors won't know. Bobby, after initially rejecting Maggie's idea to move back into his parent's extra rooms, concedes to the necessity of the situation so they move. Bobby also goes to Jack asking him for a job. Jack accepts Bobby and puts him to work with him on a remodeling job, even though Bobby is inept at almost everything. Bobby gradually gets better at the job but is still very slow. When one of the construction crewmen is arrested for drunkenness and drug use, Bobby convinces Jack to hire Danny, the engineer from the placement firm. It is eventually revealed by another crew member, a close friend of Jack's, that Jack is potentially losing money on the job and only bid on it so he could keep his crew working through the winter. This seems to give Bobby a much greater appreciation of his brother-in-law.We see vignettes of Phil and Bobby going on interviews and getting rejected, repeatedly dashing their hopes. Finally Phil asks for a meeting with an old buddy, begging him for a sales job in his friend's firm. His friend reluctantly informs Phil he can't recommend him for the job. After this rejection Phil commits suicide. After Phil's funeral Gene takes Bobby for a walk at a closed manufacturing facility on the docks and tells him stories of the early days of the company, when he was proud of the manufacturing work he did and so were his fellow workers, before the corporate greed mindset took over. Next we see Gene confronting Jim to chastise him for continuing to take even larger salaries and bonuses as the people that actually do their work lose their jobs, homes and self-respect. Jim makes it clear his conscience is not bothered and walks away from his old friend.Different scenes show that Bobby is reconnecting in a good way with his wife and kids as a result of their situation. When Gene offers Bobby a job with his new manufacturing company he's decided to launch, Bobby tells Jack he's not sure if he should take it due to the corporate pressures he knows he will face. Jack tells him ""You should take that job. You're a shitty carpenter."" It is obvious they have a better level of respect and appreciation for one another now. In the final scene we Bobby taking charge and giving assignments in a room full of his previously laid-off friends and co-workers in an office in one of the old factories where Gene, Jim and Phil all started out together."

""The Way"" is a powerful and inspirational story about family, friends and the challenges we face while navigating this ever-changing and complicated world.Martin Sheenplays Tom, an American doctor who comes to St. Jean Pied de Port, France to collect the remains of his adult son (played byEmilio Estevez), killed in the Pyrenees in a storm while walking the Camino de Santiago, also known as The Way of Saint James. Rather than return home, Tom decides to embark on the historical pilgrimage to honor his son's desire to finish the journey. What Tom doesn't plan on is the profound impact the journey will have on him and his ""California Bubble Life"". Inexperienced as a trekker, Tom soon discovers that he will not be alone on this journey. On his journey, Tom meets other pilgrims from around the world, each with their own issues and looking for greater meaning in their lives: a Dutchman (Yorick van Wageningen), a Canadian (Deborah Kara Unger) and an Irish writer (James Nesbitt), who is suffering from a bout of writer's block. From the unexpected and, often times, amusing experiences along the way, this unlikely quartet of misfits creates an everlasting bond and Tom begins to learn what it means to be a citizen of the world again. Through Tom's unresolved relationship with his son, he discovers the difference between ""the life we live and the life we choose"".—The Way California-based ophthalmologist Tom Avery has had a strained relationship with his only offspring, late thirty-something Daniel Avery, ever since the death of Tom's wife/Daniel's mother. That strain is due to the differences in their life outlooks: Daniel feels Tom doesn't really live in his standard life, while Tom feels Daniel has no focus, the latest point of contention being Daniel's decision to quit his post-graduate studies in their entirety truly to live and to find himself, the initial process being to hike on his own the 800km El Camino de Santiago as a pilgrim. Tom heads to Europe himself upon the news that Daniel was killed in an accident on the first day of his pilgrimage outside of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the French Pyrenees. In his grief, Tom, upon the suggestion of Captain Henri who was in charge of the the case, decides to have Daniel's body cremated, not to bring the remains back to California (the easier transport being the reason for the suggestion), but using Daniel's largely untouched gear to do the pilgrimage as father and son together, Tom spreading the ashes at key points along the way. This decision is despite Tom's advanced age, not having prepared physically for such a grueling hike, and being a lapsed Catholic himself. In dealing with what he considers a very private matter of which no one knows except Captain Henri, Tom amasses some travel companions along the way, the first, a large Dutchman named Joost, who is able to put two and two together. Each of the three who end up traveling with Tom has a very different reason for doing the pilgrimage, those differences which may bring them closer together or tear them apart as companions as they deal with their individual core issues.—Huggo Tom is an American doctor who goes to France following the death of his adult son, killed in the Pyrenees during a storm while walking The Camino de Santiago, also known as The Way of St. James. Tom's purpose is initially to retrieve his son's body. However, in a combination of grief and homage to his son, Tom decides to journey on this path of pilgrims. While walking The Camino, Tom meets others from around the world (three in particular), all broken and looking for greater meaning in their lives.Along The Way, Tom discovers the meaning of one of the last things his son said (in a flashback) to his father. There is a difference between ""the life we live and the life we choose."""

He soon sparks with his brother's assistant. We like Florence: she's considerate, sweet, pretty, and terrific with kids and dogs. She's twenty-five, personal assistant to an L.A. family that's off on vacation. Her boss's brother comes in from New York City, fresh from a stay at an asylum, to take care of the house. He's Roger, a forty-year-old carpenter, gone from L.A. for fifteen years. He arrives, doesn't drive, and needs Florence's help, especially with the family's dog. He's also connecting with former band-mates - two men and one woman with whom he has a history. He over-analyzes, has a short fuse, and doesn't laugh at himself easily. As he navigates past and present, he's his own saboteur. And what of Florence? is Roger one more responsibility for her or something else?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Forty-one year old Roger Greenberg is a Los Angeles raised, New York based carpenter. He has emotional issues, as witnessed by the fact that he has just been released from the hospital, where he was recuperating from a nervous breakdown. He is hyper-sensitive and hyper-critical, he who spends much time and energy writing to large corporations about the minutiae they do right and more importantly that they do wrong. He, however, sees his critical nature as being openly truthful. Roger has been spinning in his life, especially in comparison to what may have been, as, when he was younger, he vetoed a record deal for his up and coming band because of the details of the contract, all three members who never did have a career in the music business. Of his two still Los Angeles residing band mates, Eric Beller has made a financial success of his life but has not forgiven Roger for the veto, while Ivan Schrank is holistically less of a success but who has outwardly forgiven Roger to remain perhaps Roger's closest friend. Roger literally pushes pause on his life temporarily in agreeing to house sit back in Los Angeles for his brother Phillip Greenberg when Phillip and his family go on vacation to Vietnam, in the process Roger offering to build a doghouse for Phillip's family's German Shepard, Mahler. A support for anything Roger may need in Los Angeles is Phillip's personal assistant, twenty-five year old Florence Marr. A recent college graduate, Florence is smart but insecure, she having no clear goals for or direction in her life. Roger and Florence's casual encounters lead to a Roger initiated sexual relationship of sorts, Florence who can see a smart and funny person somewhere beneath Roger's damaged emotional exterior. Roger and Florence's relationship has its many ups and more downs, the latter which are largely a manifestation of Roger's outlook on his life, the two out of necessity keeping in contact if only for Mahler's sake. What ends up happening between Roger and Florence is largely affected by Roger getting a closer look at his life in being reunited with Eric, Ivan, an ex-serious girlfriend named Beth, and his college student niece, Sara.—Huggo The film follows Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller), a 40-year-old man who has recently suffered a nervous breakdown and is now struggling to just ""do nothing.""

Greenberg meets his brother's assistant, Florence (Greta Gerwig), and begins a halting, awkward romance with her. He reconnects with his old band mates -- including Ivan (Rhys Ifans) -- who are still bitter about a record deal that Roger ruined 15 years ago. Roger also attempts to date Beth (Jennifer Jason Leigh), an old girlfriend, but she rejects him.While Roger is housesitting, Phillip's dog becomes sick, forcing Roger to take responsibility for his care.

Without adult supervision, where can Joan and Cherie end up?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> The Runaways were a groundbreaking, teenage all-girl rock band from the 1970s. Good friends Joan Jett and Cherie Currie rise from rebellious Southern California teens to rock stars of the legendary group that paved the way for future generations of female rockers. They fall under the Svengali-like influence of rock impresario Kim Fowley, who turns the group into an outrageous success and a family of misfits. With its tough-chick image and raw talent, the band quickly earns a name for itself and so does its two leads: Joan is the band's pure rock 'n' roll heart, while Cherie, with her Bowie-Bardot looks, is the sex kitten.—Sony Pictures Entertainment The Runaways (aka: Neon Angels) is based on lead-singer Cherie Currie's book 'Neon Angel' - a reflection of her experiences as a rock star, but also delivering a strong anti-drug warning to teens and others. David Bowie's song 'Space Oddity' serves as a metaphor for the narrative - a slow countdown, a surreal but spectacular rise to fame, then alienation and burnout - a real long way from home.The film opens in 1975, with 15-year-old Cherie (Dakota Fanning) and her older sister, Marie Currie (Riley Keough), as Cherie has just gotten her first period. Marie's boyfriend, Derek (Brendan Sexton III), picks up the sisters from Marie's job at the local fast-food place, 'Pup n' Fries' and Marie announces to him that Cherie has gotten her period. Angry at her sister for telling, she informs Derek that Marie is not wearing any underwear. Cherie is later seen cutting her hair in a shag and putting on face makeup in an attempt to create a look resembling David Bowie on the cover of his album 'Aladdin Sane' (the cover is shown on her wall as a poster).Meanwhile, Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) is a teenage rock star wannabe who is seen huffing some joints with her girlfriend. Joan tells her friend that she wishes to become a famous rock star as her own escape from her lonely life. Cherie is later seen lip-syncing David Bowie's song 'Lady Grinning Soul' at her high school talent show and is the target of boos and jeers, as well as paper balls and other objects thrown at her on stage. At the end of the song, Cherie reacts by defiantly 'flipping the bird' (giving both her middle fingers) to the boorish crowd, but she wins the talent show anyway.Sometime later, Joan Jett is making out with a guy outside a nightclub when she sees record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon). Joan approaches him and talks about starting an all-girl rock band. Kim is interested and introduces Joan to Sandy West (Stella Maeve), a drummer. Joan and Sandy become fast friends and start jamming when Kim suggests that they recruit a hot blonde in the vein of Brigitte Bardot. At the nightclub that same night, Kim and Joan look for hot blondes to be their lead singer and discover Cherie. They ask if she wants to be in a band and she accepts. Then they tell her to come to auditions in a trailer park in the valley.Cherie learns the cover song of Suzi Quatro's 'Fever' instead and goes to audition, however they are disappointed at the song. Instead, Kim kicks Cherie out of the trailer and with Joan, thinks of a song for Cherie to audition for, thus writing 'Cherry Bomb' on the spur of the moment. Cherie sings the song and, after improving, becomes part of the band as their lead singer. Kim also brings in two new members whom are lead guitarist Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) and bass player Robin (Alia Shawkat). At the roller rink, Joan and Cherie share a passionate kiss (but what follows between them is not explicit).A year later in 1976, after moving in with her aunt because her selfish and irresponsible actress mother has moved to Indonesia, Cherie travels to her first gig with the band as they go on the road as 'The Runaways' with Kim as their manager, who scams money from their gigs for himself. A few months later, the group gets signed to Mercury Records and starts recording an album. Both Cherie and Joan soon fall victim to the rock and roll scene with popping pills, to smoking dope, snorting cocaine, and drinking heavily as their tours become more frequent and the band's popularity increases.Another year later, on account of the album's success, the Runaways travel to Japan to play a concert. Cherie causes quite a scene when she opens up the group's tour by performing on-stage wearing only a corset. After their first show, Cherie gets a phone call from her sister saying their alcoholic father is sick, but Cherie takes no interest in the situation.After another performance, Lita angrily throws magazines at Cherie that have pictures of her on the cover doing some exotic poses for a local Japanese magazine, something Cherie thought was for the whole band. After an argument with Lita, Cherie and Joan, a group of crazy Japanese fans break through a window and chase the girls out of the building. Afterwards, Cherie overdoses in the hotel, collapses in an elevator and is sent to the hospital. Upon arriving back home, Cherie's alcoholic father is passed out on his bed. Cherie takes his painkiller medication and her actions are seen by Marie.At a recording studio recording their next album, Cherie has a nervous breakdown and refuses to sing after reading a cruel comment about her by Kim in a magazine article. Though Joan defends her, Lita rudely insults Cherie for being more popular than the rest of the band; Cherie insists that she never asked for this. After a heated argument, Cherie quits the band and leaves the studio, leaving Lita, Joan, Robin and Sandy looking on. Joan breaks down, throwing chairs and beer bottles against the booth glass. Cherie returns home while Joan continues playing and starts her own band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.Eight months later, Cherie hits rock bottom when she collapses in a phone booth in an abandoned supermarket parking lot after her attempt to buy some cheap liquor for herself. At the hospital, Marie visits her and tells her to get her things straight. Cherie goes into a rehabilitation facility in her attempt to get herself clean as quickly as possible.In the final scene, set three years later, Cherie is working at a job at a local bakery in her attempt to get her life back on track when she hears Joan's cover of the song 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll' on the radio and calls the station, where Joan is visiting for interviews. After an awkward phone conversation between Joan, Cherie, and even the radio host, Rodney Bingenheimer (Keir O'Donnell), Cherie says her goodbyes and continues working, smiling when Joan's next song, 'Crimson and Clover', comes on the radio."

Meanwhile, Sally's own marriage also begins to disintegrate. Follows a pair of married couples, Alfie (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and Helena (Gemma Jones), and their daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) and husband Roy (Josh Brolin), as their passions, ambitions, and anxieties lead them into trouble and out of their minds. After Alfie leaves Helena to pursue his lost youth and a free-spirited call girl named Charmaine (Lucy Punch), Helena abandons rationality and surrenders her life to the loopy advice of a charlatan fortune teller. Unhappy in her marriage, Sally develops a crush on her handsome art gallery owner boss, Greg (Antonio Banderas), while Roy, an author nervously awaiting the response to his latest manuscript, becomes moonstruck over Dia (Freida Pinto), a mystery woman who catches his gaze through a nearby window.—Sony Pictures Classics In London, Helena Shebritch (Gemma Jones) has a broken heart since her husband Alfie (Sir Anthony Hopkins) had had a third age crisis and left her seeking his lost youth. She meets the charlatan fortune teller Cristal Delgiorno (Pauline Collins) and follows her esoteric advices believing in the power of prophecy. Alfie meets the younger call girl Charmaine Foxx (Lucy Punch) and proposes to her. Meanwhile, their daughter Sally Channing (Naomi Watts) has financial difficulties with her husband and aspirant writer Roy Channing (Josh Brolin). Roy has graduated from medical school, but has never worked as a doctor since he had written a successful first novel and decided to follow the career of writer, but he never succeeds in writing a good second novel. Sally starts working in the Geller Gallery and has a crush on her handsome boss Greg (Antonio Banderas), while Roy peeps and flirts through the window with his neighbor Dia (Freida Pinto), who is always dressed in red. When Roy's poker friend Henry Strangler (Ewen Bremner), who had written a magnificent novel and showed only to Roy, has a fatal car accident with their other poker friend Mike, Roy misunderstands that Strangler died and he steals his manuscript which is successfully accepted by the editor to be published. Their lives change when Helena meets a widower that is her twin soul and Alfie finds that he is a cuckold and Charmaine is pregnant. Roy and Sally split, and Sally, who had fantasized an affair with her boss, finds that Greg sees her as a co-worker and friend only. Further, her mother will no longer lend a large amount to her to open her own gallery following Cristal's advice. And Roy, who moved to Dia's apartment, finds that Strangler has not died, but is in coma instead.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In London, two marriages in crisis are presented. The first, which has already ended, is the forty year marriage of Alfie (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and Helena Shipridge (Gemma Jones). Alfie, who is going through a post-mid-life crisis, still sees himself as a young man, while he only sees Helena getting older. The second, which is slowly disintegrating, is the relatively young marriage in comparison of the Shipridges' daughter, Sally Channing (Naomi Watts), and her American author husband Ray Channing (Josh Brolin), their problems largely stemming from Ray's seeming inability to live up to the potential of his first novel, while earning a true wage to support him and Sally. With the Shipridges, Alfie only envisioned a new, energetic life with at least a young at heart partner. His life ends up being nothing as he suspects, that is until he meets Charmaine (Lucy Punch). However, he may not be able to see in Charmaine what the rest of the world sees in her. Helena knows that her life as she knew it is over with the divorce. She changes her tune when she starts seeing Cristal (Pauline Collins), a psychic who only seems to see positive things for her future, while only seeing the worst for Ray, who Cristal knows Helena does not like. With the Channings, their marital problems are only exacerbated by Helena's constant unannounced visits, she who seemingly needs not only to fill them in on any of Cristal's latest news of her/their life/lives, but drink them out of house and home. Ray, who has a medical degree, knows that he will never return to medicine as a career, despite the writing being stalled, and the time needed for the writing impinging on his ability to do any other work. The only thing that seems to give him any pleasure is watching the exotic young woman Dia (Freida Pinto) in red in a window across the courtyard. But he may sense fate is watching out for him with some tragic news, and Sally has returned to work putting her art history background to use in working in the art gallery owned by Greg Clemente (Antonio Banderas). This employee status is far away from what was her original professional dream of owning her own gallery, which she was planning on opening when Ray made his writing fortune. But Sally slowly begins to realize that the more her marriage seems to be deteriorating, the more she desires married Greg. As each of Alfie, Helena, Ray, and Sally pursue their dreams and desires, the illusion may be more palatable than reality.—Huggo Helena, an older woman whose husband has left her after 40 years of marriage, goes to a psychic named Cristal for advice.

Never Let Me Go,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The lives of three friends, from their early school days into young adulthood, when the reality of the world they live in comes knocking. As children, Ruth, Kathy and Tommy spend their childhood at a seemingly idyllic English boarding school. As they grow into young adults, they find that they have to come to terms with the strength of the love they feel for each other, while preparing themselves for the haunting reality that awaits them.—Fox Searchlight Pictures The film begins with onscreen captions explaining that a medical breakthrough in 1952 has permitted the human lifespan to be extended beyond 100 years. Subsequently, the film is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy H. as she reminisces about her childhood at Hailsham, as well as her adult life after leaving the school.The first section of the film depicts young Kathy, along with her friends Tommy and Ruth, spending their childhood at Hailsham, a seemingly idyllic English boarding school. It is subtly revealed that the film is set in an alternate twentieth century. A teacher is fired after telling the pupils of their fate: they exist to provide donor organs for transplants. They will be nurtured to adult age, then they will be available for ""selection."" After their third ""selection"" they will ""complete"" before they can be selected for any more procedures. Some ""complete"" after their first ""selection"", while others survive four or more ""selections."" Tommy is emotionally angry and is teased by the other boys. Kathy falls in love with him.In the second section of the film, the three friends, now teenagers, are rehoused in cottages on a rural farm. They are permitted to leave the grounds if they wish. They do not question the ethics of their situation. At the farm, they meet other graduates of similar places. Kathy, Tom and Ruth are clones who are fascinated by the idea of finding the original people that they were ""modeled on"". Kathy and her friends are questioned about rumours of the possibility of ""deferral,"" which allows couples several extra years before being ""selected"" if they are in love and can prove it. Tommy reasons that the art gallery at Hailsham was intended to identify clones who have a soul. Tommy and Ruth become lovers. The lonely Kathy applies to become a ""carer"", a clone who is taught to drive and trained to give post-operative care to other clones. In exchange for supporting and comforting donors after their organs are harvested, she gets a temporary reprieve from selection. She has become a carer by the time she hears that Tommy and Ruth have split up.In the third section of the film, Kathy has been working as a carer for several years. She has watched many clones ""complete."" She reunites with Ruth, who is frail after two ""selections"". Ruth has been keeping track of Kathy and Tommy, and helps Kathy arrange their reunion. Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy and seduced him because she was jealous and afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt, and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that Tommy and Kathy would qualify for ""deferral."" She gives them the address of ""Madame,"" who regularly visited Hailsham and selected student artwork to go into the gallery. Ruth ""completes"" on the operating table shortly afterward. Tommy tells Kathy that he has been creating art for several years in hopes of a deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, and learn that deferral does not exist. Tommy's artwork will not help them.The film ends after Tommy has ""completed,"" leaving Kathy alone. Two weeks after losing Tommy, Kathy is notified that her first ""selection"" will occur in one month. Contemplating their childhood, she speculates whether their fate is really so different from the people who receive their organs. ""We all complete. Maybe none of us really understand what we've lived through, or feel we've had enough time."""

The Illusionist,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775489/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A French illusionist finds himself out of work and travels to Scotland, where he meets a young woman. Their ensuing adventure changes both their lives forever. Details the story of a dying breed of stage entertainer whose thunder is being stolen by emerging rock stars. Forced to accept increasingly obscure assignments in fringe theaters, garden parties and bars, he meets a young fan who changes his life forever.—Anonymous In the twilight of a once-brilliant career as an entertainer, the slender and taciturn French stage illusionist, Tatischeff, now finds himself struggling to eke out a living, against the backdrop of late 1950s rapid music-hall decline. With shattered dreams and incapable of competing with the new types of entertainment, the down-on-his-luck performer leaves the neon-lit Parisian metropolis for rain-soaked rural Scotland, only to start a chivalrous friendship with an unexpected admirer: Alice, a wide-eyed young girl convinced of Tati's effortless talent and magic. Indeed, the future is promising when you are a great magician; however, has anyone escaped from today's harsh truth?—Nick Riganas The film concerns an illusionist/magician named Tatischeff (no one ever says this name, but it is mentioned on the poster he carries with him, and shows at different performances).The scene opens in Paris 1959, the entertainment landscape is changing with the advent of rock and roll, and the incoming onslaught of television. Tati finds himself playing to nearly-empty auditoriums. When it seems there's little luck in Paris, he heads off to London.The only performance there that he's able to perform is the second act following a rock-and-roll band. However, the band packs the house full of screaming girls, and the theater owner ends up keeping the performers on for multiple 'encores.' When Tati finally gets to perform, the theater is nearly empty...except for two people.Tati soon tries to peddle his act to even smaller venues, playing at cafes, bars, and at one point, a private party. However, almost no one seems to pay any attention to him...except a drunken Scotsman.The Scotsman invites Tati to perform at his pub in Scotland, and the Illusionist accepts. Unlike the other venues, the people in the pub actually stop and pay attention to the Illusionist's act. However, they are also soon entranced when the pub is wired for electricity, amazed at the place's first electric light, and soon a jukebox.One of the people who is curious about the Illusionist is the Scotsman's young daughter, named Alice. While cleaning up the hallway near the room he's staying in, she accidentally drops a bar of soap, and when the Illusionist picks it up, she is astonished when he magically turns it into a brand new bar! She is also amazed when he manages to seemingly pull money out of thin air, causing her to believe that Tati has some supernatural powers.Walking around the small town, Tati notices Alice admiring a pair of red shoes in a store window, and notices that the boots she wears are starting to fall apart. Using what money he has, he purchases the shoes for her, and magically makes them appear to her. Needless to say, Alice is delighted.Very soon, Tati decides to leave the small town, but on the ferry back to the main land, he is surprised to find Alice, who has voluntarily decided to come along with him. Tati quietly accepts her request to accompany him, as well as her request to visit Edinburgh.Tati manages to get a small apartment in a building that houses other performers. These include three acrobatic brothers, a ventriloquist, and a clown. While Alice is given the bedroom of the apartment, Tati decides to sleep on the sofa in the main apartment room.Tati manages to get a job performing at the local Music Hall, and also spends time with Alice. However, Alice meets a young man and steps out in Tati's absence to be with him. Tati comes home drunk one evening and the next morning finds Alice gone. He is despondent and walks his rabbit into the mountains and sets him free. He then packs his bags and catches a train to who knows where.After being out with her young man, Alice comes home to an empty apartment. Tati has left her some money and a note saying ""magicians do not exist"". She takes her suitcase, turns out the light and joins her young man waiting downstairs in the street.On the train, Tati shares a car with a mother and her child.The final scenes show the lights of the city going out except for the televisions in a shop window.

Becca and Howie Corbett are a happily married couple whose perfect world is forever changed when their young son, Danny, is killed by a car. Becca, an executive-turned-stay-at-home mother, tries to redefine her existence in a surreal landscape of well-meaning family and friends. Painful, poignant, and often funny, Becca's experiences lead her to find solace in a mysterious relationship with a troubled young comic-book artist, Jason - the teenage driver of the car that killed Danny. Becca's fixation with Jason pulls her away from memories of Danny, while Howie immerses himself in the past, seeking refuge in outsiders who offer him something Becca is unable to give. The Corbetts, both adrift, make surprising and dangerous choices as they choose a path that will determine their fate.—Anonymous Becca and Howie are still dealing emotionally with the accidental death of Danny, their four year old son and only offspring, eight months after the fact. Danny died by being run over when he ran out onto the street chasing after his dog. Becca and Howie are finding that they need different mechanisms to cope. They have been attending a support group, Becca who is openly hostile toward the group, not wanting to turn out like Gabby and Kevin who have been attending the sessions for eight years, or like the couple that relates everything about their experience to their religious beliefs. Becca seems to be erasing anything physical that reminds her of Danny, including wanting to move, while Howie wants those physical touchstones, even wanting the dog back which they got rid of after the accident but which he still loves and knows Danny loved. Outwardly, Howie wants their life to return to some normalcy, including resuming a sexual relationship, while Becca seems to be having more difficulties doing so as she will not even reach out to one friend she knows wants to provide support but doesn't know how to make that first step. It may not help Becca's psyche that her irresponsible unmarried sister Izzy is having an unplanned baby. And Becca cannot handle it whenever her and Izzy's mother Nat tries to provide comfort, especially relating stories about the heroin overdose death of Becca and Izzy's brother Arthur eleven years ago. Despite loving each other, Becca and Howie's marriage may not be able to to survive these differences.

Becca (Kidman, in an Oscar-nominated performance) and Howie Corbett (Eckhart) both find themselves choosing very different ways to express their devastation, and it threatens to tear their marriage apart."
The Trip,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740047/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Steve Coogan has been asked by The Observer to tour the country's finest restaurants, but after his girlfriend backs out on him he must take his best friend and source of eternal aggravation, Rob Brydon. When Steve Coogan is asked by The Observer to tour the country's finest restaurants, he envisions it as the perfect getaway with his beautiful girlfriend. But, when she backs out on him, he has no one to accompany him but his best friend and source of eternal aggravation, Rob Brydon.—Anonymous Exhausting a list of friends,Steve Coogan, commissioned by the Observer to write a piece on the restaurants of Northern England, is finally able to convince one of those ""sort of"" friends,Rob Brydon, who is more a professional colleague, to accompany him on the week-long business road trip to eat at some of those restaurants, all expenses paid, with Steve giving Rob a minor cut of the commission. The commission and the trip were originally designed around Steve's American girlfriend, Mischa, a writer and foodie who eventually couldn't come on the trip needing to go back to the States. In some respects, the food takes a back seat as there is quiet discomfort between the two almost at every turn, most specifically from Steve's perspective, as Steve shows time and time again that he is the senior partner in this venture who gets to make all the decisions. That discomfort stems from Steve's insecurity manifesting itself in he continually comparing himself to Rob, including who can do the better impressions (which is now Rob's bread and butter career-wise) and as Steve struggles to achieve his goal of a mainstream movie career. And although Steve is arguably the more successful career-wise, he is not as happy, which is underlined by the real reason Mischa didn't come on this trip and Steve not hesitating to embark on a one-night stand at every opportunity.—Huggo"
Stone,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1423995/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A convicted arsonist looks to manipulate a parole officer into a plan to secure his parole by placing his beautiful wife in the lawman's path. Parole officer Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) has only a few weeks left before retirement and wishes to finish out the cases he's been assigned. One such case is that of Gerald ""Stone"" Creeson (Edward Norton), a convicted arsonist who is up for parole. Jack is initially reluctant to indulge Stone in the coarse banter he wishes to pursue and feels little sympathy for the prisoner's pleas for an early release. Seeing little hope in convincing Jack by himself, Stone arranges for his wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), to seduce the officer, but motives and intentions steadily blur amidst the passions and buried secrets of the corrupted players in this deadly game of deception.—The Massie Twins A convicted arsonist schemes to get out of prison by convincing his debauched wife to seduce his retirement-ready parole officer in director John J. Curran's adaptation of a play by Angus MacLachlan (who also authored the screenplay). His career as a parole officer winding down after years of service, Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) reluctantly accepts an assignment to reassess inmate Gerald ""Stone"" Creeson's (Edward Norton) case for an upcoming parole hearing. Convicted of setting a fire to make the murder of his grandparents look like an accidental death, Stone will do anything to get out from behind bars, and his wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), is willing to do whatever it takes to help secure her husband's freedom -- including seducing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack's devoted wife, Madylyn (Frances Conroy), has suffered with the emotional weight of her husband's demanding job for far too long. Young mother Madylyn Mabry puts her daughter to bed while her husband Jack watches a ball game on television. A bee buzzes around the window as she stays with her girl. After the child is asleep, she goes downstairs and announces she's leaving, saying ""You keep my soul in a dungeon."" He takes a moment to disconnect from the game, then runs upstairs to the bedroom and holds their daughter out the window, threatening to drop her if Madylyn leaves. ""Do you think I won't? Do you think I won't?"" he yells at her. She agrees to stay.Many years later, Jack Mabry(Robert DeNiro) and Madylyn (Frances Conroy) return home from church for a quiet afternoon. He watches TV and drinks in an identical pose to his younger self in the earlier scene, while she works on a puzzle. Late that night a call wakes them. Jack picks up the phone and hears a woman's voice. ""Betsy?"" he asks, obviously distressed. We find him at church the next day, speaking at his brother Bobby's funeral.Jack reports to work at a prison, where he's a parole officer. He listens to Christian radio in his car on the way in. Once there, we see him talk to different inmates but hear a persistent buzzing in the background as if to suggest that Jack has other things and pressures on his mind. He's called into the warden's office and asked to shut the door. The warden calls one of his reports ""an incompetent mess."" before laughing and revealing he's joking. He then asks Jack to get Janice, his replacement, up to speed on his cases before he retires. Jack agrees, but requests that he keep all of his ""currents"" until he leaves, in order to see them through until their reviews. Janice offers condolences about Jack's brother. Jack has a new case in his office, named Gerald Creeson (Ed Norton) Jack reviews his file as if the man isn't there. He insists that he likes to be called Stone. Jack is hesitant to oblige, assuming it's a prison nickname. Stone asks Jack if he can help him get out early, pointing out that he acknowledged his guilt and isn't interested in talking about what he did when it's all in the file. Jack wants to talk about his crimes however, and Stone has an outburst assuming Jack isn't interested in helping. Stone dares him to give him the maximum and starts walking out. Jack then yells at him, letting him know that they talk about what he wants to talk about and demanding he ""sit the fuck down.""Jack then explains, ""Look, this is the process, we talk. We're not friends, but let's pretend we're friends. Just relax. Just talk. That's all.Then maybe we both get what we want. OK?"" He then asks Stone about his wife, Lucetta. Stone describes her as a ""dime"" which he explains to Jack means ""a perfect ten."" He also tells Jack that she's an alien. Jack assumes he means she's an illegal alien, but Stone says ""No. She's whiter than you. She's from another planet."" Stone describes her sexuality graphically, telling Jack, ""She's crazy. She'll do anything."" He warns Jack ""Look if we're gonna talk about Lucetta, you gotta watch out cause it's gonna give you some pictures in your head, gonna keep you up nights, man."" When he notices that Jack doesn't look pleased, he apologizes for his mouth. Stone asks about Jack's wife. When Jack says he's been married 43 years, Stone remarks "" 43 years and you still get it on and everything?"" This offends Jack and Stone tries to explain, he's just curious about how he'll do when he's older. Jack explains that he doesn't discuss his wife that way. He tells Stone ""I don't consider this polite conversation."" and reminds Stone that they're there to talk about him.Jack drives home listening to more radio, and buying a couple of bottles of booze on the way. He sits on the porch with Madylyn, both of them listening to a Christian radio program discussing predestination. Madylyn attempts to talk to him but he isn't even aware of it. She asks ""Where have you gone?"" Jack meets with Stone again and asks him to recount the arson incident. Stone tells him that ""Teach"" and his grandfather got into a fight which ended with Stone's grandparents dead, before Stone torched the house. Jack wants to talk more about it.
Jack: Whose idea was it?
Stone: I told you it was Teach! Like I said I wasn't even...I went outside the house.
Jack:Yeah, but you didn't stop him, did you?
Stone:Stop him what? Jack:From killing your grandparents.
Stone: You ain't gonna do it man. You're not gonna...You don't give a fuck man. I was outside. Teach come out and I didn't even know what he done until he told me. Teach testified to that, man! That's why I didn't even catch the rap for manslaughter. I got accessory and arson. I've done eight out of ten to fifteen. What more do you want, from me? Jack stares at him blankly.We then find Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) at a preschool working with kids. She smiles, telling the class that today is a day for them each to do one nice thing for someone else and not tell anyone about it.Madylyn is hosting a card game for her friends. She gets a phone call from a woman looking for Jack, the sound of the call is distorted, but the caller hangs up when she says she'd Mrs. Mabry and offers to take a message.Stone calls Lucetta from prison and catches her watching the kids at recess. Lucetta tells him that ""she was short with me, like she didn't want to talk."" Stone asks ""Why were you talking to her?"" He tells her ""I need you to do this for me right now. Don't let it slide."" She says OK. We see Stone having another meeting with Jack who says
""I guess what I'm getting at, is do you believe what you did was wrong?""
Stone: What do you think, because I grew up west side, that I'm one of these socio...delinquent types, don't know the difference between right and wrong? Want me to tell you about my bad childhood?
Jack: I don't know. Did you have one?
Stone: Well, at the time, I thought a lot of shit was normal...definitely unhealthy, but on the same token, i didn't think I was a bad person to begin with. You want to know if I'm gonna light any more grandparents on fire?
Jack: Are you?
Stone: No.
Stone tells him he deserves to be free, telling Jack ""I'm as clean as you."" Jack says ""Maybe, maybe not.""
Stone: Seriously, let me ask you something, you know? Why do you gotta sit there, asking me these questions, like you never done nothin'. Why do you get to walk around free and I don't?
Jack: I wasn't convicted of a crime.
Stone: You never did anything bad? You never did anybody no wrong, had to be forgiven for nothing?
Jack: I never broke the law.
Jack shuts him out, staring blankly again while Stone asks him about the many things he could have done. Stone claims he's been reborn, but can't answer when Jack asks what ""reborn"" means to him.Lucetta stops at the prison for a visit with Stone. She likes his cornrows, and the two are cautioned against contact when she starts kissing him passionately. He asks for an update on her contacting Jack. She tells him she's left messages and he hasn't called her back. He instructs her ""You've got to get with him person to person."" She tells him she didn't wear panties just for him, and he touches her but restrains himself before getting carried away, not wanting to break the rules. He says ""I can't get no ticket.You understand right? I'm too close."" She appears disappointed but agrees. He tells her he's got to get out or he's likely to kill himself, which she tells him not to joke about. Stone becomes fascinated with another prisoner reading the Bible to his son. After the visitation is over, he gets every religious book he can from the library.Nothing seems to catch until he finds one on ""Zukangor"" This religion is a patchwork of many and instructs that enlightenment can be achieved by hearing the ""perfect pitch"" making yourself ""like a tuning fork.""That night Lucetta leaves a message on Jack and Madylyn's answering machine, before calling up a guy for sex. She's waiting for Jack outside the prison the next day. He tells her it isn't appropriate to meet this way, acting as if she's there to see Stone and reminding her of proper channels to do that. She then offers him a bird's nest that the kids in class made, which he refuses but then reconsiders when she describes the kids making it. Jack asks Stone about it, but he says that Lucetta does whatever she wants. Stone runs the Zukangor faith past Jack, describing the tuning fork idea and their practice of chanting then listening.. Jack isn't into the idea, saying he's Episcopalian. Stone explains that the religion also uses reincarnation, stating you have to come back until you get it right. Jack asks him ""What about this life?"" and Stone tells him he's thought about that a lot.Jack and Madylyn go to church, but Jack stays behind to talk with the pastor, telling Madylyn to go home. He tells the pastor that faith seems to come easy for people he knows but not to him, he says ""sometimes the thoughts that I have, I think you should shoot me."" Pastor: I don't think that's what God wants for you.
Jack: What does he want?
Unable to give a concrete answer the pastor quotes a verse saying ""Be still and know that I am God."" which he paraphrase to Jack as meaning sometimes God speaks in mysterious ways.In the prison yard, Stone tries the chanting, but seems to find it too noisy. Lucetta calls Jack's house again, Madylyn picking up the phone first. When Jack asks who it is she says ""a friend of yours."" He tells Lucetta she shouldn't call the house, making a point to call her Mrs. Creeson although she insists on Lucetta every time. She wants to know when they can meet. Jack: Look Mrs Creeson, I have business with your husband...
Lucetta: Well that's why I'm calling. I mean, what, did you think I had another reason? Jack: Well, no, I didn't.
Lucetta: Maybe we could go to lunch. You could bring Mrs. Mabry too. You know she's got such a sweet voice, what's her first name? Jack: Look, I admire that you love your husband and that you want to do what's right for him, but you're not helping him. I'm telling you that right now. Lucetta: [raspy voice] Oh Jack I do love my husband. I love him so much, and all I'm asking you, is for a chance to help you see him in a different light. i mean, how many men at that place you work at have somebody loving them like that? huh? Doesn't that mean something to you? A man in a position like yours?
Jack: No. It does.
She describes how she misses him in her bed, and Jack goes quiet, looking around self consciously. Madylyn is somewhere close by. We then see Lucetta visiting Stone. She tells him ""I got him. It's gonna happen."" Stone looks dead tired and looks at her coldly. He complains that it's too loud all the time and he's having weird dreams. He talks about suicide again, and she assumes he's referring to a dream, and then asks him if he ate spicy food before bed.Jack meets Lucetta for lunch. He starts talking about his grandchild, and mentions that his daughter's getting divorced, explaining ""People are gonna do what they're gonna do."" She notices him fidgeting with back pain. She mentions magnet therapy as a suggestion for his back, explaining that the magnets remove toxicity, from cell phones and everything in the environment. Lucetta has an egg which she tells him she has to eat because the kids painted it. She offers it to him, making a voice to indicate the egg talking, she says ""Eat me."" He says ""Why not."" and takes a bite saying ""I'm just eating the healthy part."" She says ""Go on, just eat the whole thing."" They end up at Lucetta's place where she asks him if he feels the magnets. Madylyn sits at home on the porch in the dark, smoking cigarettes. Jack has a few drinks and ends up sleeping with Lucetta.Stone is lying in bed in his cell and two guards come to get him asking what's wrong and escorting him to Medical. While he waits for someone to see him he witnesses another inmate being brutally shivved. Stone sees it occur through a barred door, close enough that he gets blood on him. He reaches out to the dying man through the bars, wide eyed, as if he's realized something. We hear a high pitch in the background, as he looks in the dead man's eyes.At Jack's house the next morning, Madylyn reads from a devotional book aloud to Jack, asking ""To what extent is my commitment to obey God based on do's and don'ts or out of true love for him? In what recent circumstance was I aware of God's leading?"" She asks Jack, ""Why don't you say the blessing?"" which he does, saying a standard prayer but adding ""Make us mindful of the needs of others."" eliciting a look from Madylyn. She asks Jack if he wants an egg, and he quickly declines.Stone sits in the cafeteria, looking more peaceful, and seems able to block out the noisy room. Jack drives listening to the radio which says ""We are not sinners because we sin. We sin because we are sinners."" He goes to a field to drive golf balls, but soon goes to see Lucetta again for sex, which she seems pretty open about, telling Jack he's a good man for ""helping them"" while they're in bed. Jack tells her sternly that nobody is to know about this, warning that whatever it is she wants will ""all go bad if anybody knows."" She just says ""Of course silly.""Stone is out in the prison yard staring at the sky, and we see that he isn't affected by the noise. He goes in to visit Lucetta and asks her ""Do you ever wonder about things they say go on forever?""
Lucetta: What? Stone: Things they say go on forever - like... what's that mean, you know? The sky, like, they say the sky goes on forever. But what is that really? That's - I mean, you can't see nothing you can't see, so... it's like a big bowl of blue above you. You can see clouds during the day or you can see stars at night maybe, but even with a telescope you can't see forever. So how do they know? Lucetta: Know what? Stone: What it is. Eternity - how do they know?
Lucetta changes the subject saying ""So Jack, he said the board's gonna review the whole thing. Okay? And they're gonna take into consideration your age and, you know, your Mom, and all that and the fact that you were an addict back then. [noticing he doesn't appear to be listening] Stoney baby, look at me. I was trying to tell you about your parole!
Stone: Yeah
Lucetta: Well, you weren't listening.
Stone: Oh yeah, I'm listening.I am.
Lucetta: Ok. So Jack said...
Stone: You call him Jack?
She explains what Jack plans to do and tells him it's great but Jack is distant. HE says ""Sometimes i think the best thing is to just listen."" prompting her to cry and tell him to ""stop playing.""Jack is angry when he comes into work the next day. He meets with Stone who attempts to explain something about his experience with the inmate who was shivved. Jack doesn't seem to get any sense of what he's saying, reading in his notes that Stone had ""a profound spiritual epiphany."" Stone says he's never heard that word before, and tells him they can drop it. Jack says ""Don't get me wrong. I'd like to believe in such things.""
Stone: Like what? Like me? You believe in me?
Jack: Sure, I'd like to believe in you too. That's why we're all here, right?
Stone attempts to describe it again, as a moment when ""all the static went away, and I could hear for real."" He explains that he now sees that his life in prison isn't empty and pointless like he thought it was. He tells Jack, that the efforts he'd asked him for earlier aren't important to him anymore, saying ""You should do what you think is right. Okay? I am whatever you say I am in there. So write what you feel. Seriously."" He explains that he wants to be out but is likely to have the same problems he's always had when he gets out.Jack stops by to see Lucetta again, and tells her what happened. She tells him it's probably ""some kind of play acting."" and that he's always had different ideas about things. Jack tells her ""It was different."" and asks her to ""be straight. Is this all just an act/ Just tell me what's going on."" She tells him ""I don't do anything I don't want to do. I like you Jack. I would never fuck you if I didn't want to."" He tells her he's not going to come by anymore but she tells him he will. She says that even after Stone gets out, they can still be friends too. Jack still tries to leave and she mentions that Stone is ""a good man at heart."" He seems shacked and asks ""Do you really believe that."" She says ""Yeah I do. no different than you and me."" Jack asks if she goes to church ans Lucetta says ""Hell no. There's no such thing as God."" Jack gets home and showers before going to bed.The next day, he tells Stone that he sent the report recommending early release. Stone seems antagonistic about it and surprised. He goes over the details of the night of the arson, describing seeing his grandparents dead when they were alive two minutes ago. He says that he heard a loud buzzing in his ears and knew that there needed to be a fire. He asks ""You ever seen a fire take control? It's something, It's alive. I watched it take them up and start to change them. And the only thought that came in my head was 'This is awesome.' Jack: Awesome?
Stone: Yeah. It was truly awesome. And the thing is, I know I'm supposed to take responsibility for my actions. I know that I'm supposed to feel guilty about it, but I never did, and I never knew why. But, now I think i can understand that it was just part of what was supposed to happen in my life's journey. You know?
Jack: That was your decision. He explains that they're all God's coworkers, without knowing it. Jack insists it has nothing to do with God and cuts him off. Jack: Enough of this shit. You know...You...Lucetta, she said that you were...
Stone: Lucetta?
Jack: Your wife she...
Stone: You call her Lucetta? Don't...
Jack: What?
Stone: Don't listen to her. Jack: What do you mean?
Stone: Don't listen to what she's telling you man.
Jack: She believes in you.
Stone: It's a game to her. It's a game. I told you in the beginning, she's an alien. She's like a freak.
Jack: That's not a nice thing to say.
Stone: No. Listen, I'm telling it to you straight. She's just working on you. Jack starts to get angry and tells Stone he's nuts that he has ""a beautiful wife that cares about you..."" but Stone asks ""beautiful? you think she's beautiful?"" leaving Jack speechless a moment.he recovers
Jack: Okay, you're a con, I've known that from the start. I didn't believe you for one fucking second. Never did. Never did. So you've both been conning me? Ok. I know. I've been around the block a few times. Sick and fucking tired of it.
Stone: What'd I say man?
Jack rants about being conned and his frustrations, that ""no one changes for the better."" Stone asks him ""Do you have anyone?"" which only angers him more. Stone then advises him to ""blow your life up. I'm pulling for you."" Jack gets irate and starts yelling at the guards to come grab Stone. JAck drives home without the radio. Late that night, Lucetta leaves a message on the machine, saying she needs him to call as she's in the dark on everything. The next morning the phone rings while he and Madylyn are eating breakfast and she tells him to let the machine get it, but he doesn't getting up to get the call, to find it's their daughter. That night he sits with Madylyn on the porch. She's been reading Zukangor, and tells Jack he started out as a stone, and worked his way up to human, and each incarnation has been paying off debts. He realizes she's reading from a flyer which she tells him was junk mail and she says ""You know what I think? I think we get this one life. I do. You account for what you've done and if you don't you pay for it when you die. You don't think?"" Jack: Oh [beneath his breath] Shit.
Madylyn: Shit. Shit. Son of a bitch. Fuck. Fuck.
Jack: Ok. I get it. Madylyn continues swearing at him, when Lucetta pulls up in the dark, and approaches the porch. Jack gets up to persuade her to leave. He calls her Mrs. Creeson and attempts to act official until they get to the car and he says ""Get in the fucking car."" She asks what's going on with her husband and angrily says she just needed a friend to talk to, but drives away. He acts outraged about her coming to their home for Madylyn's benefit.At work in the morning, Jack is asking the warden for Stone's report back, explaining he made an error. The warden isn't happy, as the hearing is in an hour. The warden tells him that it doesn't matter as Stone's fate is already determined by ""luck and quotas."" Jack doesn't stay for the hearing. We see that he takes his gun when he leaves the prison. Jack is at home drinking with Madylyn, who is discussing their devotional book. She mentions that they'll be looking at the commandments next. Jack asks her ""Do you believe in all this?"" and she tells him to read the next lesson. ""What request is on the top of my prayer list today? Is it a selfish request or is it one that will bring God glory?""
Madylyn: I know what I want. How about you? You lost your place again? Is there something you want to say to me?""
Jack: [shakes his head]
Madylyn: You don't?
Jack: I can't even think of what you'd want me to say.
Madylyn gets up from the table and leaves him there.Stone is informed that he'll be released.He stops in to see Jack while he's waiting. Stone asks if he wants to talk about anything, as he ""looks a little ragged."" Jack reminds Stone that he can have him watched twenty four hours a day. Stone remarks ""Shit man, you don't believe in nothing do you?"" Jack: I believe you're one sick son of a bitch.
Stone: I know you don't believe in me, but you don't believe in yourself. You don't believe in God. I don't think you feel that anything is true inside.
Jack: I'll give you true. I'm glad you're out of my hair Gerald Creeson. Now you can be someone else's headache.Jack makes it clear he wants him out of the office. Lucetta shows up to pick him up and comes into the office. Stone asks if he can kiss her and Jack says that's fine. He tells her he's ready to go, but Stone turns back before leaving and says to Jack ""You know I want to thank you. Seriously. I appreciate everything that you've done for me.""
Jack nods uncomfortably and looks at Lucetta and says ""Good luck to you too Mrs. Creeson."" She answers. ""Lucetta, Jack. We're all friends here, right?"" He says ""Take good care of him."" She whispers ""I will. You take good care too old man. See you later Jack."" As Jack is about to shut the door behind them, Stone stops and says ""I meant to say, Lucetta, she did tell me that you fucked her. I know that must be against some kind of rule around here. Jack: I knew what you two were doing.
Stone: Oh, did you know what you were doing when you let my wife suck your cock? Jack: Good luck to you.
Stone: See you out on the bricks.
Jack: Good luck to you!Jack gets home and that night we see he's taking his gun out to the porch. He remembers Lucetta telling him she liked him as he tries to sleep. He thinks he hears noises downstairs and keeps his gun in hand to go look. He finds a fire downstairs, and goes to get Madylyn who is already awake. Watching the house burn Jack keeps taking the lord's name in vain, which she repeatedly tells him she won't stand for. He remarks that they were almost incinerated by ""some nutjob I let out."" and she insist that ""nobody did this to us. It was an act of God."" She makes up a story about frayed wiring in the kitchen wall and rags in the basement. ""Why would you say that?"" Jack asks and she say ""Because. it's as good a story as any.""We see Madylyn with her daughter and granddaughter, looking through photo albums. Her daughter says ""I don't know how you stuck it out as long as you did. I'd think you'd have done this sooner."" Madylyn says ""I almost did, once."" although she doesn't answer when asked ""what happened?""
Jack is at the bar with his coworkers, for his retirement party. He starts giving Janice, his replacement, advice about all the cons she'll be dealing with. He starts hitting on her, but she insists they keep things professional, but he starts swearing at her and then at the warden who steps in. They offer to drive him home but he insists on leaving himself. He listens to the radio, which is about God having Satan on the ropes, but Satan is flailing his arms which causes damage. Jack sees Stone walking down the street and approaches him with gun in hand asking why he ruined his life. Stone says ""Hey man you ain't gonna do this."" which causes a reaction similar to the beginning with Jack saying ""You think i won't? You think I won't?"" with a gun to Stone's face. With the gun still on him, Stone shakes his head and says ""No. No I don't."" He looks at Jack before walking away. Jack goes into work to clean his office. We hear the radio station again, and we hear Stone, describing the sound which brings spiritual truth and the tuning fork idea. Stone packs a bag and starts walking down the road. We see Lucetta at a bar trying to get a guy's attention. Madylyn smokes a cigarette alone looking over a fence. She hears a bee buzzing, which also seems to be heard by Jack, in his old office, who looks up from packing."

Flipped,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0817177/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two eighth-graders start to have feelings for each other despite being total opposites. In 1957, when second-graders Bryce Loski and Julianna ""Juli"" Baker first meet, Juli knows it's love, but Bryce isn't so sure and tries to avoid Juli. By the sixth grade, in 1961, Bryce tries to get rid of Juli by dating Sherry Stalls, whom Juli despises. However, Bryce's best friend, Garrett, takes an interest in Sherry and eventually tells her the truth about Bryce asking her out; she doesn't take it well. From Juli's perspective, Bryce returned her feelings, but was shy. After finding out Bryce and Sherry broke up, she thought she could have Bryce back. But then they reconsider their decisions as time goes on. In 1962, Bryce's grandfather Chet Duncan moves in with the family. Chet has different views about Juli. There's a large, old sycamore tree that Juli loves which no one else understands. One day, it's cut down by a group of landscapers so a house can be built there, despite Juli's opposition. She becomes very depressed afterwards, as the tree let her see the world in a more enlightened way. Her father gives her a painting of the tree. 1963. The Loskis and the Bakers have lived across the street from each other since 1957 when the Loskis moved into the neighborhood. They, as families, have never spent any time together socially in the differences especially between the family patriarchs, judgmental Steven Loski who has always viewed the Bakers as beneath him especially since they won't even maintain their yard, while free-spirited Richard Baker has other priorities in life with the family's limited funds to worry too much about what Steven thinks. Juli Baker, now in the eighth grade, has had a crush on classmate Bryce Loski ever since the Loskis were unloading their moving truck when she and Bryce were in the second grade, and Juli looked deep into Bryce's eyes. Bryce, however, has done whatever he felt he needed to do to avoid who he considered overbearing and thus annoying Juli. Bryce's maternal grandfather, Chet Duncan, who recently moved in with the Loskis, sees Juli in a different vein, she the rare soul that is a beacon of light, much like his now deceased wife. Several events in Bryce and Juli's lives are shown this year - seen individually from Bryce and Juli's very different perspectives - that may change the tide in their relationship, the ups and downs which are also affected by external forces combined with the strength or weakness within each of Bryce and Juli.—Huggo Juli Baker devoutly believes in three things: the sanctity of trees (especially her beloved sycamore), the wholesomeness of the eggs she collects from her backyard flock of chickens, and that someday she will kiss Bryce Loski. Ever since she saw Bryce's dazzling brown eyes back in second grade, Juli has been smitten. Unfortunately, Bryce has never felt the same. Frankly, he thinks Juli Baker is a little weird--after all, what kind of freak raises chickens and sits in trees for fun? Then, in eighth grade, everything changes. Bryce begins to see that Juli's unusual interests and pride in her family are, well, kind of cool. And Juli starts to think that maybe Bryce's dazzling brown eyes are as empty as the rest of Bryce seems to be. After all, what kind of jerk doesn't care about other people's feelings about chickens and trees? With Flipped, mystery author Wendelin Van Draanen has taken a break from her Sammy Keyes series, and the result is flipping fantastic. Bryce and Juli's rants and raves about each other ring so true that teen readers will quickly identify with at least one of these hilarious feuding egos, if not both. A perfect introduction to the adolescent war between the sexes.—anonymous In 1957, when second-graders Bryce Loski and Julianna ""Juli"" Baker first meet, Juli knows it's love, but Bryce isn't so sure. Girl-phobic and easily embarrassed, young Bryce does everything he can to keep away as much as possible from Juli for the next six years, which isn't easy since they go to the same school and live across the street from each other. When they start the sixth grade, Bryce hopes that he can get rid of Juli by asking the girl Juli hates the most, Shelly Stalls, out on a date. This plan works for a while, up until his best friend Garrett takes an interest in Shelly and tells her the truth about Bryce asking her out. Juli sees Bryce and Shelly break up and goes back to her regular Bryce-obsessed ways.From Juli's point of view, when she and Bryce first met, he returned her feelings but was just shy and embarrassed. When he ""held her hand"" she thought she would get her first kiss from him in the second grade. Juli knew that she was flipped from then on. After finding out that Bryce and Shelly broke up, she thought she could have her old Bryce back. She spent the whole year smelling his watermelon-scented hair and wondering if she'd ever get her kiss.In 1963, now in seventh grade, Bryce's grandfather Chet Duncan moves in with the family. Chet finds Juli different, special, and a rare kind of girl who's hard to come across. He continues to tell Bryce this with hope. There's a large, old sycamore tree that Juli loves which no one understands. One day, it's cut down by the owner in spite of Juli's protest and dismay. Her voice narrates her love for the tree that let her see the world in a much more enlightened way.Chet and Juli form a strong friendship over time while he helps her work on her messy lawn. Bryce begins to develop feelings for Juli just as Juli begins to question her feelings about Bryce. Her feelings completely disappear when she overhears him and Garrett talking about her mentally challenged uncle, and sees him throwing away the eggs she gave him. When Juli tells Bryce she never wants to speak to him again, she and her family coincidentally get invited to the Loski's house for a sit down dinner, which ends up with Bryce's dad being considerably rude to her family. At the dinner she confronts Bryce about what he said about her uncle and tells him she doesn't want to speak to him again, not ever. During dinner, sitting opposite each other, she never talks or makes eye contact with him. After dinner she apologizes for the way she acted. Bryce is upset that she apologizes, because that means that she doesn't care enough to hold a grudge.She continues to have mixed feelings about Bryce when the school's basket boy auction looms just around the corner. She hears that Shelly plans to bid on Bryce against another one of the school's ""finest"" girls. Bryce thinks that Juli plans on bidding for him after hearing she walked in with a wad of cash (which she wasn't planning on having with her). Just as Bryce begins to worry about what would happen if she does bid for him, she bids all her cash on basket boy number eight, the boy before Bryce.Later, during the basket boy bidding lunch, Bryce and Shelly sit at a table across from Juli and basket boy number 8, Eddie Trulock. With her facing Bryce, he can't help but stare at Juli the whole time. He sees she's having a good time with her date and gets jealous. He leaves Shelly, grabs Juli to talk to her, and attempts to kiss her in front of everyone. She dodges his kiss and flees. Juli gets on her bike and cycles home as fast as she can, with Bryce following. Incredulous, Garrett chases after Bryce for abandoning Shelly, and the two break off their long friendship after a confrontation.Juli arrives home crying. Bryce continuously tries to talk to her, ringing the doorbell, calling her house, knocking on her bedroom window, despite her ignoring him. Finally, one day Juli sees Bryce digging a hole in her front lawn, which infuriates her. Her father said he gave him permission and she watches Bryce continue to dig. After finishing the hole, he leaves. Juli is confused but Bryce returns carrying a baby sycamore tree and places it in the hole. She goes outside to help him. Knowing that he redeemed himself, Bryce covers Juli's hands with his. They share smiles and then continue planting the sycamore tree, both aware that their mutually first kiss won't be long in coming."

Inspired by true events, Kathy (Rachel Weisz) is an American police officer who takes a job working as a peacekeeper in post-war Bosnia. Her expectations of helping to rebuild a devastated country are dashed when she uncovers a dangerous reality of corruption, cover-up and intrigue amid a world of private contractors and multinational diplomatic doubletalk.—Production In 1999, in Nebraska, the police officer Kathryn Bolkovac sees the chance to raise money to be close to her teenage daughter, who lives with her father in another state, with the temporary assignment serving as U.N. peacemaker in Bosnia. The idealistic Kathryn believes that she can make the difference in a country devastated by the war, and she works hard and is promoted to director of her department. But soon she discloses a corruption and human trafficking ring with the direct participation of contractors and diplomats that have diplomatic immunity and she does not know who is reliable.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Kathryn Bolkovac (Weisz), a Nebraskan police officer, accepts a well-paying UN peacekeeping job in United Nations-regulated Bosnia. Working for a private contractor, the International Police Task Force is responsible for training local law enforcement bodies to restore order to the wartorn country. As she begins to get the lay of the land in her new environment, Kathryn starts to see signs of a shocking underground human sex trafficking industry, whose patrons are not only from within the corporation but from within the United Nations itself. Kathryn Bolkovac (Rachel Weisz) is a police officer from Lincoln, Nebraska who accepts an offer to work with the United Nations International Police in post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina at a UK company called Democra Security (a pseudonym for DynCorp International). Upon fighting for a trial for a Muslim woman suffering from domestic abuse and succeeding, Kathryn is made head of the department of gender affairs. Kathryn starts making advances in her department by encouraging investigations to be conducted by Bosnian officers & by upping the convictions rate for crimes in her area. Her work comes to the notice of Head of UN Department for Human Affairs, Madeleine, who encourages Kathryn to keep up the good work.Meanwhile, Raya (Roxana Condurache), a young Ukrainian woman, and her friend Luba (Paula Schramm) are sold to a sex trafficking ring in Bosnia by Raya's aunt's husband. Raya escapes along with Irka (Rayisa Kondracki), another girl who was forced into prostitution. Both are sent to a women's shelter specifically set up for the victims of sexual slavery. While investigating their case, Kathryn is able to uncover a wide-scale sexual slavery and human trafficking ring that various international personnel, including those of the United States, have participated in. She finds that the owners of the brothels have paid off the UN monitors from Democra in addition to the local police forces. She tries to enlist the help of her UN comrade Fred Murray, who is also from the US, but he also tries to pass off the girls as waitresses at a local bar & not tortured sex slaves. Kathryn figures that Fred has also been paid off. She takes Raya & Irka to Laura Levi (Monica Bellucci) who runs the medical center for Bosnians, but she refuses help as the girls are Ukranian & she is not allowed to touch them without clearance.Kathryn investigates the bar where Raya & Irka were found & uncovers photos of UN personnel from Democra violating the girls. Her efforts raise the flags internally with the senior management at Democra.She persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court by promising that they will be safe, but an indifferent Laura drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she is unable to produce a passport. When Kathryn confronts her she simply says that she couldn't keep Irka as she had no passport & no embassy would recognize her. Kathryn is angry. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Though Kathryn manages to rescue a terrified Irka in the woods, the latter is too afraid to go forward with the trial.Kathryn investigates further with the help of girls at the women's shelter, some of whom agree to testify & help Kathryn. She figures out that the UN team with Democra is not only aiding slavery in Bosnia, but is complicit in trafficking girls from Ukraine & other Baltic countries into Bosnia for slavery.
When she brings the scandal to the attention of the UN, Kathryn discovers that they have covered it up in order to protect lucrative defense and security contracts. She nonetheless finds allies in her investigation in Madeleine Rees (Vanessa Redgrave), head of the Human Rights Commission, and in Internal Affairs specialist Peter Ward (David Strathairn). But Peter is shut down by his own superiors & steam rolled into not pursuing Kathryn's case. Peter meets Kathryn & advises her to go public with her case as that was the only way left to bring attention to the situation.Through her trusted sources Kathryn manages to locate Raya, but her raid to the bar is tipped off to her corrupt colleagues who show up at the bar at the same time. All the girls, including Raya refuse to cooperate with Kathryn for fear of further persecution from the traffickers. Kathryn pleads with Raya not to be afraid & to come with her, but Raya refuses.When Raya is later found dead, Kathryn sends an email entitled ""Do not read this if you have a weak stomach or a guilty conscience"" to a 50 senior mission personnel detailing her findings.She is subsequently fired from her job. She and Ward capture evidence of an official admitting to the scandal before she is forced to leave the country, and she brings it to the BBC. It is said in the ending credits that following Kathryn's departure, a number of peacekeepers were sent home, though none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws. It is also noted that the United States continues to do business with private contractors like Democra Security, including contracts worth billions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Made in Dagenham,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371155/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dramatization of the 1968 strike at the Ford Dagenham car plant, where female workers walked out in protest against sexual discrimination. In 1968, the Ford auto factory in Dagenham was one of the largest single private employers in the United Kingdom. In addition to the thousands of male employees, there are also 187 underpaid women machinists who primarily assemble the car seat upholstery in poor working conditions. Dissatisfied, the women, represented by the shop steward and Rita O'Grady, work with union rep Albert Passingham for a better deal. However, Rita learns that there is a larger issue in this dispute considering that women are paid an appalling fraction of the men's wages for the same work across the board on the sole basis of their sex. Refusing to tolerate this inequality any longer, O'Grady leads a strike by her fellow machinists for equal pay for equal work. What follows would test the patience of all involved in a grinding labour and political struggle that ultimately would advance the cause of women's rights around the world.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In 1968, the women at the Ford auto plant in Dagenham, England go on strike. As sewing machine operators making the coverings for car seats, their jobs have been reclassified from semi-skilled to unskilled. A friendly shop steward, Albert Passingham, tells strike leader Rita O'Grady that this isn't about whether they are skilled or not. They're getting paid less because they are women and unless they change things, they will always make less than the men do. The women walk off the job and eventually the plant runs out of car seats with the entire plant shutting down. With the men now out of work it's left to Rita to convince them they need the support of all workers to succeed. The intervention of a senior government Minister who takes up their cause despite a heavy-handed response from Ford clears the way for a solution and leads to legislation on equal pay for work of equal value. Based on a true story.—garykmcd 1968. The one hundred eighty-seven women machinists at the Ford plant in Dagenham, England, long filed a grievance against the company to have their jobs classified as semi-skilled as opposed to unskilled, their job to sew the seat covers for the vehicles manufactured. They are the only women working at the plant, compared to the fifty-five thousand men. With the company refusing to negotiate, the machinists, supported by their local union representative Albert Passingham, take job action, including refusal to do any overtime, and a twenty-four hour strike. It isn't until after this job action occurs that the machinists discover that the job classification is not the issue, but rather Ford's unwillingness to pay them equal to the other unionized employees solely because they are women. As such, the fight becomes a broader one of equal pay for equal work. Emerging as the primary voice of the machinists is Rita O'Grady, who had no interest previously or history of labor activism. Ultimately, the machinists take full blown action in walking off the job, they expecting the support they have previously provided to their male colleagues to be reciprocated in respecting the strike. The women will find that they have an uphill battle in their fight. Ford managers on both sides of the Atlantic refuse to give in to any such demands secretly seeing doing so as a dangerous precedent in having to pay all women in the company equally. Many of the male union members don't support the strike seeing their jobs as being more important if only because they are generally the household breadwinner. Beyond Albert, the machinists' own union managers, their representative being Monty Taylor, provide little support in seeing the fight for their male members more important, and they protecting their own perks funded largely by union membership dues. There may cracks within the ranks of the female machinists themselves based on how the strike affects their individual situations, including within Rita's own family. And if it does become a broader policy issue beyond Ford, the British government has to balance the importance of Ford to their economy against the fact that they campaigned on equality to get into power. Although the new Secretary of State for Employment,Barbara Castle, supports the notion of equality, her first job as she sees it is to ensure economic stability which means keeping Ford happy.—Huggo Based on a true story, this film portrays a decisive moment in the '60s when the fight for equal rights and pay was led - unexpectedly - by ordinary working-class women with one foot in the kitchen, one foot on the factory floor, and ears glued to the pop coming over the radio and telly from far-off London. Led by a young married mother (Hawkins), one of 187 women who worked for the Ford Motor Company, the region's principal employer, these feisty factory girls shook their world with spirit and courage, and achieved lasting social change. The film opens with some facts and figures about the Ford Dagenham factory and the number of people employed, a fraction of whom were women.Against a background of Desmond Dekkar's ""The Israelites"" the opening shot shows the sewing room where the seat covers and door panels are hand-sewn by women on individual sewing machines. Many of the women are stripped down to their underwear, presumably because of the hot working conditions.The union shop steward, Albert, played by Bob Hoskins, walks into the room, he has to shield his eyes in embarrassment from the half-undressed women. He tells them that the only way for the women to progress their claim against being regarded as unskilled workers is to take industrial action. They all agree to an overtime ban and a one-day strike.The women are then seen at a party celebrating a birthday, one of the girls slips out and is seen having sex in the back of a car (a Ford Corsair). She returns and they get rapidly drunk before staggering home.Rita is then shown having breakfast with her family. Husband Eddie has to be roused out of bed by Rita with a splash of cold water on his back! Rita's son complains that the teacher has hit him, Rita resolves to sort it out. She goes to the school to see the teacher, Mr. Clark, who is dressed in academic robe. He explains that he forgot his protractor on numerous occasions and was caned, he explains in a patronising way that children from the council estate sometimes couldn't cope and needed reminding on how to behave and not forget things. Rita is furious, leaves the classroom and bumps into another parent (later identified as Lisa) who, when she asks if she is OK, she tells to F.... off.Back at the factory we see all the women working, there's a leak in the roof, Connie points out that Sandra should be reminded about her workmanship. Albert comes and announces that there's to be a meeting at Ford HQ in Warley, and that 2 of the women should go, they nominate Connie, who is the shop steward, and Rita.At home Rita's family are watching Black & White TV, there's a news bulletin about a demo in London (Red Lion Square demo against Vietnam war) and then Sooty with Harry H. Corbett. We learn that Eddie also works at Fords.They're going to the meeting, on the way they stop at a Berni Inn for a steak dinner, apparently this is normal practice, we are introduced to Monty Taylor, the works convener, a stereotypical union representative. He tells them not to say anything and nod at everything he says. At the meeting the women, and Albert, quickly cotton on the fact that the union is selling them out.

He proposes that Rita should take over from shop steward from Connie, whose husband is ill.Outside, Rita, dripping wet, is invited in to a car, where she meets the woman she met in the school, who explains that Mr. Clark is a bully and she has also complained about his use of the cane.

Peter is embarrassed and tells her to fetch more cheese!Rita is giving out strike pay - £3 each. She goes to see Connie. Connie says that she cannot come to any meetings because George is ill he's touched she says. We see George and Connie in bed, George is having a nightmare and wets the bed.

Despite being no saint herself, Julia Cody has shielded her seventeen year old son, Joshua ""J"" Cody, from her Melbourne-based criminal relatives who they have not seen in years. After Julia dies in front of J's eyes from a self-inflicted heroin overdose, J, who is slightly detached from life, feels he has no choice but to contact his maternal grandmother, Janine ""Smurf"" Cody, the family matriarch, for a place to live. Smurf rules the family with a borderline incestuous love over her three sons, the quietly menacing Andrew ""Pope"" Cody, the hyperactive Craig Cody, and the barely of age Darren Cody.

Melbourne's Armed Robbery Squad is after specifically Pope, who is hiding out. But when the standoff between the Codys and the Armed Robbery Squad is brought up a notch, an all out war ensues, with some casualties and J caught in the middle. The only grounding in J's life is his girlfriend, Nicky Henry. With those casualties comes an investigation by Homicide Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie, who knows the Codys are involved in some of those deaths. As Leckie tries to get J on his side, J has to figure out how best to get himself out from the middle, where he trusts neither side. J also wants to figure out how to exact what he considers justice in an all around bad situation.—Huggo Set amidst the explosive world of a family addicted to crime, as experienced through the eyes of a naïve 17-year-old youth (Frecheville) who enters their lair. It's the Wild West, where criminals and police wage their war on the city's streets, while the innocent suffer the consequences. After his mother overdoses on heroin, Joshua 'J' Cody is forced to move in with his estranged grandmother, Janine 'Smurf' Cody, the matriarch of a notorious Melbourne crime family.

Buried,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462758/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Paul is a U.S. truck driver working in Iraq. After an attack by a group of Iraqis he wakes to find he is buried alive inside a coffin. With only a lighter and a cell phone it's a race against time to escape this claustrophobic death trap. Waking groggy in pitch darkness, Paul Conroy, an American truck driver working in Iraq in 2006, slowly realizes he is trapped inside a wooden coffin, buried alive. With his cigarette lighter, he can see the trap he is in, and he quickly realizes that there's not enough air for him to live long. He finds within the coffin a working cellphone, which allows him contact with the outside world. But the outside world proves not to be very helpful at finding a man buried in a box in the middle of the Iraqi desert. Paul must rely on his best resource--himself.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> American Paul Conroy is in Iraq working as a truck driver for contractor Creston Rowland & Thomas (CRT). His is the last truck in a convoy that is attacked by unknown forces. Being knocked on the head probably by a rock is the last thing he remembers before he awakens, gagged, his wrists bound, and he locked and buried in an old fashioned handmade wooden coffin. After he is able to remove the gag and the wrist constraints, he finds in the coffin a lighter which provides some illumination, a pen and most importantly a smart phone with approximately sixty percent battery life. The phone, set to some Arabic script which he does not understand, was placed there as a means of communication with his unknown captors, who are demanding a ransom of $5 million by 21:00, which is in a few hours. Paul uses the phone to try to contact someone, anyone, who he thinks can help him, including his wife back in Michigan, the US State Department and CRT, which is not as easy for him as he would like. Over time, he is able to find other items in the coffin, again placed there purposefully by his captors, for other things they ask him to do. Some of these items may become useful for Paul in his survival. Beyond his captors, there are other obstacles to Paul making it out alive, some obvious such as lack of air, the phone dying and the box not being reinforced, but there are some other obstacles and dangers, perhaps the most fearful to him being some people on the other end of the phone.—Huggo Paul Conroy awakes to find himself in a wooden box, buried underground. He is a civilian contractor and truck-driver in Iraq. His convoy was ambushed and he was taken captive and buried alive. He has a limited amount of air, giving him a limited time to find a way out. All he has to aid him in this task is his cigarette lighter, a torch, a mobile phone and his will to live.—grantss Paul Conroy, a US truck driver, awakens buried alive, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo and a BlackBerry. Although he initially has no idea as to how he got there, he soon starts to piece together what has happened to him. Gradually, Paul remembers that he and several other convoys were ambushed by insurgents, then all the other truck drivers were killed shortly before he blacked out. After finding the cellphone, Paul attempts to contact his wife and his employers (who gave him a safety number if anything like this should occur) but is able only to leave a message for both of them. Paul is able to contact the FBI, but they cut off before he can explain the situation. However, he is able to determine from the questions the FBI official asks him that he has been kidnapped. The kidnapper contacts him and demands a ransom of $5 million to release him alive, but this is then lowered to $1 million.Paul eventually gets into contact with the State Department, who pass him onto a group set up in 2004 specifically made to find people who have been kidnapped. While the man, Dan Brenner, who is trying to find Paul tells him that they are doing their best, Paul is not convinced and asks the man to name a person who they had saved before. He claims they saved a man known as Mark White three weeks ago. After a long time of his trying to get help, the kidnapper forces him to make a ransom video, which he refuses to do. The kidnapper threatens to kill his kidnapped co-worker, and Paul reluctantly agrees to do the video. Shortly afterwards, there is a violent shaking in the coffin, and sand starts to leak into it. He then receives a video from the kidnapper of the female employee he knew being shot dead, causing him to feel incredibly guilty and to vomit. The stress becomes too great and Paul momentarily considers slitting his own throat with the knife, but he stops after thinking about his family.Later on, he receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job that morning due to fraternizing with the same female employee (though Paul says the relationship was strictly professional) and so if he dies, his family will not get any insurance money. The government group calls Paul and explains that some F-16 fighter planes just bombed the area the coffin is in even though they knew he was in the area (they were able to roughly pin down his location, but not exactly). The sand starts to leak in at a considerably faster rate and Paul begins to lose all hope and does a last will and testament in video form, giving his son all of his clothes and his wife all of his personal savings ($700). As time goes on (with nobody planning to pay the ransom), the kidnapper calls with demands for blood instead of money and tells Paul to cut his finger off and send a recording of it. If he doesn't do this, the kidnapper will harm his family (as he reveals the details of where they live). If Paul does make the video, his family will not be harmed, and he will tell the US government where Paul is. With this, Paul complies, cutting his finger off and sending the video.Within a few minutes, the government official phones Paul saying they now know where he is, explaining that they were given details of where to find a man who was buried alive by an insurgent. Paul receives a phone call from his wife and tells her he is going to be okay, and they express their love for each other. A few minutes later, he gets a call from the rescue group saying that they are close and have found his location. They arrive at the apparent burial site and are about to dig up the coffin. Through the phone, digging is heard, but Paul cannot hear digging around him. Sand begins to fill the coffin to dangerous levels, giving Paul seconds left. However, when the group digs up the coffin, it turns out the insurgent led them to Mark White, the man Brenner earlier in the film claimed had been rescued. Paul hears his final words, that of Dan saying over the phone, ""I'm sorry Paul. I'm so sorry."""

A love story and murder mystery based on the most notorious unsolved murder case in New York history. The original screenplay uses newly discovered facts, court records and speculation as the foundation for a story of family, obsession, love and loss.—Official Synopsis David Marks is the eldest of the third generation of the New York Marks real estate moguls, they who are in the top five of all New York City landowners, primarily of tenements and commercial properties renting to what would be considered seedy shops. David never had any desire to enter into the family business, which was run during the late twentieth century by his long widowed father, the cutthroat Sanford Marks, with whom he had a detached relationship. In November 2003, David is testifying at a trial, where one of the attorneys, Richard Panatierre, is questioning him primarily about his life with his wife, Katie Marks née McCarthy, who he met in January 1971 when she was a tenant in one of the Marks owned buildings. Sanford never approved of Katie because of her working class status. Before they got married, David and Katie moved to Vermont to open a health food store, although their life was subsidized by Sanford. Sanford was able to convince David to move his family back to New York City and to accept a job in the family business doing work which Katie would probably not agree with if she knew its nature. As David got immersed in this work, his mood and behavior changed drastically to a point where Katie no longer saw in him the man she married, although she tried to stand by him even through these difficulties. But their lives began to drift apart. As Panatierre continues his questioning to its conclusion with David, the true nature of the trial and the reasoning for the questions about Katie come to light. The trial would not have have occurred without the direct or indirect involvement of (among others) David's longtime friend, writer Deborah Lehrman, an ambitious new New York District Attorney named Janice Rizzo, and a more recent Galveston based friend of David's named Malvern Bump.—Huggo"

Coach Grobe was selected the ACCs Coach-Of-The-Year, and Jon performed brilliantly in the ACC Championship Game with fifteen solo tackles against powerhouse Georgia Tech."

The First Grader,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790663/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of an 84 year-old Kenyan villager and ex Mau Mau veteran who fights for his right to go to school for the first time to get the education he could never afford. Set in a mountain village in Kenya the film tells the remarkable true and uplifting story of a proud old Mau Mau veteran who is determined to seize his last chance to learn to read and write - and so ends up joining a class alongside six year-olds. Together he and his young teacher face fierce resistance, but ultimately they win through - and also find a new way of overcoming the burdens of the colonial past.—Unknown Kenya, 2003: A radio DJ announces that the Kenyan government is offering free primary school education to all. Maruge (OLIVER LITONDO), an 84 year-old villager, hears this and decides he wants to educate himself. Arriving at his local school, with a newspaper clipping about this change in policy, he meets Jane (NAOMIE HARRIS), the schools principal, and expresses his desire to learn. Her colleague Alfred (ALFRED MUNYUA), in an effort to get rid of him, tells him all pupils need two pencils and an exercise book.The next day, Maruge returns, telling Jane he wants to learn to read. He has a letter from the Office of the President that he wants to understand. Exasperated, she tells him the school already has too many pupils. Later that night, she tells her husband Charles (TONY KGOROGE) about Maruge. Cautious of his own position, working alongside the government in Nairobi, he advises her to fight the battles she can win.After cutting his trousers and turning them into shorts, Maruge returns to the school again. While Jane tells the school inspector Mr. Kipruto (VUSI KUNENE) on the telephone that she currently has five children to a desk, when Maruge re-appears, she relents. Alfred is reluctant, yet Jane is defiant, claiming Kipruto is not the head of the school. Allowing Maruge into her class, she seats him near the front after he admits his eyesight is not so good and begins to teach him, and her other charges, how to write the alphabet.Plagued by memories of his time in Kenya in 1953, when he fought with the Mau Mau against the British, it even impacts upon Maruge in class, when Alfred scolds him for not keeping his pencil sharp. Made to sharpen it, he breaks down as he recalls a time when the British tortured him using a sharp pencil brutally thrust into his ear. Apologising to Jane, saying it wont happen again, Maruge later educates his fellow pupils, patiently explains about the fight for land that he and other Mau Mau undertook and teaching them the word for freedom.Resentment brews over Maruges education. At home, people shout that he should stay away from the school, while in the playground, covert photographs are taken of him. Soon enough, the story that an old man is going to school hits the radio airwaves. Kipruto arrives, furious that he has learnt in the press that Maruge is attending his school. Jane tells him that Maruge fought against the British. She later learns from Maruge that the same soldiers killed his family.Desperate to keep Maruge in school, Jane calls Charles, but he advises her not to go over Kiprutos head. She wilfully ignores him, visiting the head of the education board to plead Maruges case. Her protests fall on deaf ears and Maruge is made to attend an adult education centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no ambitions to learn. He goes to see Jane, telling her he must learn to read because he wants to be able to understand the letter hes been sent. Refusing to go back to the adult education centre, Maruge nevertheless must say his goodbyes to the children. Yet Jane offers him a reprieve as her teaching assistant.As the story breaks, the press descends on the school, surrounding Jane and wanting to question Maruge. He tells the reporters that the power is in the pen. Nevertheless, his presence in the school is beginning to cause anger amongst the parents of the young pupils. One mother confront Jane, accusing her of seeking fame and fortune from all the attention, while another father proclaims to Alfred that the school is spending too much time on Maruge. Again, Kipruto arrives with the school in chaos, telling Jane that her special pupil cannot stay and that plans are afoot for the government to compensate the Mau Mau.Resolute, Jane decides to teach Maruge to read after school has finished despite receiving threatening phone calls. A delegation of politicians arrive at the school, keen to cash in on the free publicity surrounding Maruge, while secretly demanding that Jane cut them in on any money she has received. Events begin to spiral - people attack the school with sticks while Charles receives an anonymous telephone call, noting his wife is now out of control. Jane soon receives a letter that she is to be transferred to a school 300 miles away. Charles tells her that events surrounding Maruge are tearing them apart, explaining that hes received calls claiming she has been unfaithful.Jane explains to Maruge that she is being transferred, and then undertakes an emotional goodbye to the children, who all bring her gifts. Meanwhile, Kipruto introduces the class new teacher. Enraged, the children padlock the school gate and throw missiles at her and Kipruto. Meanwhile, Maruge travels to Nairobi, heading to the Ministry of Education, where he confronts the board on behalf of Jane, showing them the scars he sustained as a young man tortured by the British.Jane returns to the school, where Maruge is there to welcome her back. He wants her to read to him his letter, which explains he will be compensated for his time in the prison camps. As the film draws to a close, the radio DJ announces that Maruge the Guinness Book of Records holder for the oldest person to go to primary school will speak at the United Nations.

Frank Darrbo is a hapless fry cook. When his wife Sarah falls off the wagon and dumps him for Jacques, a drug dealer, Frank tries to get her back by reporting her kidnapped, grabbing her from Jacques' car, and wailing for her to return. After watching Christian TV and having a vision, he becomes a superhero to fight evil. He sews a costume, finds a weapon (a pipe wrench) and looks for crimes to stop. He has problems: his wrench inflicts real injury, so the cops want him for being a vigilante, his sense of boundaries is flawed, and Jacques' gang has guns. Libby, a clerk at a comic book store, becomes his sidekick, and it's time to go save Sarah. What chance do they have?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Left with only one happy moment in his entire life, the quiet short-order cook, Frank Darbo, knows that he's losing his beautiful former addict wife, Sarah, to the smug, drug-dealing strip-club owner, Jacques. Then, after a wondrous late-night epiphany, Frank plucks up the courage to transform the horrible depression and his simmering anger into something useful, and just like that, a determined superhero emerges, The Crimson Bolt. Now, a large, cast-iron pipe spanner and a loyal female sidekick--the overzealous, Boltie--can go a long way towards winning the eternal battle against crime; however, fighting the scum of the Earth and winning Sarah back are two entirely different things. But, in the meantime, don't steal; don't push drugs, and don't be evil because Bolt and Boltie are in the neighbourhood. Is there a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow?—Nick Riganas Frank Darbo (Rainn Wilson) is a meek fry cook at a diner who has had two perfect moments in his life: marriage, and assisting the police to apprehend a criminal.

Four Lions tells the story of a group of British jihadists who push their abstract dreams of glory to the breaking point. As the wheels fly off, and their competing ideologies clash, what emerges is an emotionally engaging (and entirely plausible) farce.

While Omar and Waj go to a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, Barry recruits a reluctant fifth member, Hassan (Arsher Ali).

The Tempest,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1274300/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Shakespeare's epic play is translated from page to screen, with the gender of the main character, Prospero, changed from male to female. In Writer, Producer, and Director Julie Taymor's version of ""The Tempest"", the main character is now a woman named Prospera (Dame Helen Mirren). Going back to the sixteenth or seventeenth century, women practicing the magical arts of alchemy were often convicted of witchcraft. In Taymor's version, Prospera is usurped by her brother and sent off with her four-year daughter on a ship. She ends up on an island; it's a tabula rasa: no society, so the mother figure becomes a father figure to Miranda (Felicity Jones). This leads to the power struggle and balance between Caliban (Djimon Hounsou) and Prospera; a struggle not about brawn, but about intellect. In Shakespeare's fantastical thriller the magician Prospero orchestrates spirits, monsters, a grief-stricken king, a wise old councillor, two treacherous brothers and a storm at sea into a fantastical conspiracy bringing banishment, sorcery and shipwreck into the lives of two hapless lovers to stir and seal their fate. Here Prospero takes female form as Prospera (Dame Helen Mirren), giving her journey of vengeance and self-discovery a wholly new resonance. As Prospera breaks her magical staff against an entrancing volcanic landscape at the end of her heroic quest, this poignant story of love and forgiveness translates into a riveting and filmic mystical tale, for our own times.—Icon"
Rare Exports,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401143/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the depths of the Korvatunturi mountains, 486 meters deep, lies the closest ever guarded secret of Christmas. The time has come to dig it up. This Christmas everyone will believe in Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve in Finland, Santa Claus is unearthed in an archaeological dig. Soon after, children start disappearing, leading a boy and his father to capture Santa and, with the help of fellow hunters, they look to sell him back to the corporation that sponsored the dig. And then there's Santa's elves, who are determined to free their leader...—Anonymous At the top of a large hill, an excavation team at the behest of an American has begun to dig deep into its core. When the excavation chief makes a startling discovery of sawdust deep within the mountain, the elder American financing the dig is ecstatic. He requests that the men keep excavating, but also demands that they uphold certain rules that are printed on some cards he gives. The excavation chief laughs at them (which include the caveats ""no smoking"" and ""no cursing""), but the American angrily demands that he is dead-serious that the rules are to be followed.Nearby, two Finnish boys named Pietari (Onni Tommila) and Jusso (Ilmari Järvenpää) are spying on the men. After watching them get back to the excavation, they head back through a hole in a fence down from the mountain that they have cut open. As it is almost Christmas, Pietari turns to talk about Santa Claus, when Jusso explains that Santa doesn't exist. This soon causes Pietari to do some research on his own, and looking through numerous books, finds that ancient legends of Santa Claus paint him as an evil entity that punishes naughty children in sometimes evil ways (some illustrations show a horned figure whipping children, or dunking them in a boiling cauldron).As Christmas approaches, Pietari keeps watch outside his window. One morning, he awakes to see footprints on the shed roof near his second-story window. Certain that they were not caused by his father Rauno (Jorma Tommila), he assumes it must have been Santa, possibly coming to get him.Later on the 23rd of December, Pietari and Rauno go to a round-up area to meet several other villagers who are planning to capture and kill the nearby reindeer. Preparing a pen with electrified fencing, the villagers are shocked when at the appointed hour, only 2 reindeer show up. Pietari, Jusso, their fathers and a third man ride off in the general direction where the reindeer come from, and find them: all laid dead near the fenxing surrounding the nearby mountains. Rauno finds the hole in the fence that Pietari and Jusso cut (though Jusso whispers to Pietari not to say a word about what they did), and assumes this is the work of the persons who have been reported to be working on the nearby mountain range, and that this whole caused nearby wolves to come through and feast on the herd.With their village's livelihood at stake, the men head up to the mountain to demand remunerations for what happened, but find the entire area deserted, along with a gigantic crater in the center of the mountain.The group then goes to Rauno and Pietari's place, where in his room, Pietari shows Jusso an excavation image he found in the deserted shed on the hill. Pietari tells of how an old tribe according to his books, captured Santa years ago, and in order to keep him from getting loose, froze him in the local waters, and then buried him under the mountain that was being excavated. Naturally, Jusso claims that Pietari is overreacting.The next day, Pietari goes outside, and notices that his father's wolf trap has been tripped. The two go to check it out, but upon seeing a bloody hand, Rauno ushers the boy back into the house and calls his friend Piiparinen. Piiparinen comes, and he and Rauno drag the corpse to Rauno's shed. Fearful to have a dead body on their hands, Rauno first thought is to carve it up and get rid of it, but the body of the old man starts to breathe. He is also found to have a coat on, containing a wallet and an American passport in it. As they decide what to do, Rauno catches Pietari spying on them, and rushes out to see Pietari running down the road. Giving chase in his truck, Rauno notices as the local Sheriff picks up Pietari, and continues on his way. Rauno follows close behind, and makes his way to a Jusso's father's place. Jusso's father claims that someone stole all the sacks for his potatoes (though strangely, just left all the potatoes there). The Sheriff also claims that people have been reporting things like ovens and heaters stolen during the night.Pietari goes into the nearby house to talk to Jusso, but instead, finds a straw figure in his bed. Pietari takes it and shows the men, but they just assume that Jusso has run off to do mischief.Pietari then has Jusso's father come back to their house with him, since he knows English. They go into the shed and find that Piiparinen has been attacked by the old man, who is now curled near some lights for warmth. Jusso's father tries to speak English, but the old man doesn't respond. Meanwhile, Pietari has gone back into the house, and called the families of other kids he knows...only to find that their kids are missing too!When Pietari goes into the shed and claims that the old man is Santa Claus, the adults (naturally) don't believe him. When the old man attempts to come at Pietari, the older men chain him up, but are then surprised when a walkie-talkie in the old man's coat begins to squawk. As they listen, the voice on the walkie-talkie claims that he is coming to get Santa Claus, and wants to know if he is ready. Hearing this, the men then arrange for a drop-off point at a nearby small airport.Dressing the old man in Piiparinen's Santa suit, they head to the airport, and the American who was running the excavation appears, arriving in a helicopter. The men demand payment of $85,000 (what they were sure to make from the killing and sale of the reindeer herd), but the American examines the old man, and explains to the men that they are in error: they have not caught Santa Claus, but one of his 'helpers.'A sound nearby is heard as the helicopter pilot is dragged away and killed, and as the men look about, the lights go out, and numerous old men with long white beards appear, coming out of the shadows. When Rauno looks for Pietari, the boy leads them to a nearby hanger. After barricading the doors, they soon come face-to-face with a strange sight. In the center of the hanger, is a large, ice-encased creature with two large horns. Around it are the village's children tied up in potato sacks, and numerous ovens and heaters hooked up, that appear to be melting the ice.The men are unsure what to do when Pietari manages to silence them, and come up with a plan. The 'helpers' are most likely attracted to the children. Piiparinen manages to get out of the hanger, and start up the helicopter. Flying it over a hole in the large hanger, the children are kept in the potato sacks, and lashed to a large net that pulls them out. This causes the 'helpers' to give chase.Nearby, Rauno and Jusso's father find dynamite, and rig the iced creature in order to destroy it, after being sure they have turned off the ovens and heaters.Meanwhile, Pietari has radioed to Piiparinen to fly the helicopter towards the enclosure meant for the reindeer. When they note that the fence is closed, Pietari radios that he will sacrifice himself to open the gate. Dropping to the ground, he opens the gate, and prepares for the 'helpers' to descend upon him.However, just before they do so, Rauno and Jusso's father blow up the ice-encased creature, and the 'helpers' stop, as if coming out of a trance.Having herded them all into the enclosure, Pietari has counted over 198 'helpers.' Soon, the men and Pietari find a silver lining in this.With less than a year to go, the 198 'helpers' are cleaned, groomed, and taught to act like Santa Clauses for Department stores and other festive occasions. The men then call their business venture ""Rare Exports,"" and ship off the 'helpers' in crates to various locations (for a price, naturally)."

After fighting off a pair of wolves using a ski pole, Joe slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard as the wolves chase after him.Another night passes and no one has shown up to help Parker. She now realizes that something has happened to Joe and, the next day, she begins to attempt a jump down herself, but the bolt holding the lift chair fails and the chair drops some twenty feet but is caught by a supporting cable. Parker jumps down, now from a fairly safe height, but is injured after the lift chair falls on her ankle. Parker then alternately slides and crawls down the mountain, pausing when she sees a streak of blood in the snow and is then approached by a wolf. After sizing her up, the wolf returns to the nearby pack, who are apparently finishing off Joe's remains. Completely traumatized, Parker makes it the rest of the way down the mountain to a nearby road. Eventually, a car appears and a man (Peder Melhuse) comes to her rescue. While on the road, the man calls the hospital and tells them that he had found a girl hurt outside of the ski resort. The film ends with Parker hearing Dan tell her ""You'll be ok, baby.

Monsters,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470827/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Six years after Earth has suffered an alien invasion, a cynical journalist agrees to escort a shaken American tourist through an infected zone in Mexico to the safety of the U.S. border. Six years ago NASA discovered the possibility of alien life within our solar system. A probe was launched to collect samples, but crashed upon re-entry over North America. Soon after, new life forms began to appear and half of Mexico was quarantined as an infected zone—Annon After a NASA deep-space probe crash lands in Mexico, alien life-forms spread throughout the U.S.Mexico border region leading to the quarantine of half of Mexico. The U.S. and Mexican militaries battle to contain the creatures with air-strikes and defoliation, while a wall stretching along the American border keeps the United States protected. The film begins with night vision footage of a US Army patrol driving through a town in the middle of the night. An explosion flips one of the vehicles, and fragmented flashes of gunfire show US soldiers firing at an enormous tentacled creature that ambushed the patrol. In the background a radio transmission from one of the soldiers obtains approval for a dangerously close airstrike. Meanwhile a civilian screams for help and attempts to drag a woman off the road and away from the creature. The soldiers withdraw as the man is left behind, lifting the woman and trying to carry her away. Moments later an air-to-ground missile homes on the creature's head.The main plot thread begins a few days prior to the ambush. Andrew, a young American photojournalist in Mexico is hired by his wealthy employer to get the latter's daughter, Samantha, back to the United States. The pair's introduction does not go well: Andrew has no interest in being a chaperone, is haunted that he will miss the birthday of his estranged six year old son, and is troubled by a job that forces him to photograph only the destruction caused by the alien creatures rather than the fact that people are living alongside them. Samantha, meanwhile, is going through a crisis regarding her own position in life, her relationship with her father, and her impending marriage.While travelling to the coast to get a boat to the United States, the pair are temporarily curtailed by the destruction of the railroad and find out that the aliens' migration season is beginning early. If they do not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked and they will have to wait six months before another window is available.Arriving at the port, Andrew is forced to spend $5000 to buy Samantha a ferry ticket to return to America.

Tucker and Dale vs Evil,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1465522/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Affable hillbillies Tucker and Dale are on vacation at their dilapidated mountain cabin when they are mistaken for murderers by a group of preppy college students. Two lovable hillbillies are headed to their ""fixer-upper"" vacation cabin to drink some beer, do some fishin', and have a good time. But when they run into a group of preppy college kids who assume from their looks that they must be in-bred, chainsaw-wielding killers, Tucker & Dale's vacation takes a bloody and hilarious turn for the worse.—Tucker The film begins with a news reporter and her camera man investigating a crime scene much further than what was already given, ala The Blair Witch Project. They walk in an abandoned mill, hoping to find more clues only for the news reporter to be suddenly struck on the head. The camera man gets frightened and runs off before being struck as well, dropping his camera and dying moments later. You then get a glimpse of a disfigured man smiling into the camera.Three days earlier, Allison (Katrina Bowden) and her friends, Chad (Jesse Moss), Jason (Brandon Jay McLaren), Chloe (Chelan Simmons), Naomi (Christie Laing), Chuck (Travis Nelson), Mitchell (Adam Beauchesne), Mike (Joseph Allan Sutherland), and Todd (Alex Arsenault), are out on a road trip, hoping to find a good time in the woods to party and smoke weed, before they rush in front of a truck belonging to Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine). The two catch up with the college students, giving them dirty stares for cutting them off and speeding, which was misinterpreted by the students as a threat. Naomi says they forgot to bring the beer and the college students panic and stop at a store.At the store, Chad and Allison walk inside to see Tucker speaking with the store clerk and the two give each other a stare off, with Chad and Allison believing they are intimidating them, but in reality, the two hillbillies were intimidated by them. Allison browses the store and catches Dale on the other side of a shelf, who becomes frightened and turns around. Chloe then comes and confesses to Allison that the place is ""creepy"" and she agrees. After the two leaves and Chad purchases beer, Tucker and Dale, who are both munching away at pickled eggs, are putting their supplies in their truck. Dale, who has an inferiority complex, begins staring at the college girls, particularly Allison, and feels that girls like them cannot mix well with a guy like himself. Tucker tries to uplift his friends spirit and advises to go talk to the girls, telling him to just smile and laugh when he gets nervous. Taking the advice, Dale, while holding a bush-whacking scythe, approaches the girls and attempts to strike up a conversation, laughing nervously while doing so. This easily terrifies the girls, which makes Chad step in and scare off the nervous hillbilly.The college students continue on their road trip while Tucker and Dale drive to their newly-acquired vacation home, which the two were dreaming of getting, all the while Tucker continues giving advice to Dale, that ""Life is short, you gotta go after what you want."" He then drops beer upon his lap and Dale goes down to clean it up. Suddenly, a cop car is following them, which Tucker slightly panics and pulls over, with Dale struggling to get free, finally pulling himself up without his shirt on as the cop reaches their window. Tucker hands him his temporary license, as he lost his and a new one is being delivered via mail. The cop begins interrogating the two and asks where they are headed. Tucker states they are heading to their new vacation home in the woods. The cop warns them to stay away from that place as dangerous things happened there and tells them they have a busted tail light before leaving.The two finally reach their old cabin, which they call a ""fixer-upper"", seemingly impressed by the shoddy wooden house. The two go inside to see bones hanging from the ceiling, which Tucker assumes belonged to an archaeologist, and newspaper clippings on a wall, all of which connected to the Memorial Day Massacre, but ignored by the two friends as they caught eye of a coupon instead. The cabin is obviously falling apart, as when Tucker leans on a pillar, it creaks and a beam of wood with nails poking through the end of it, falls. Dale saves Tucker from being impaled through the head and the two agree to fix that as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the college students set up camp and are sitting around a campfire. Chuck asks if they all want to hear a scary story, which they all verbally reply ""No."" Chad then comes in and asks if they want to hear a real scary story, in which the others comply.He begins taking his inhaler (he has asthma) and starts with the Memorial Day Massacre, which occurred twenty years ago at the very woods they are camping on. Six college students were out partying on the woods until two psychotic hillbillies approach them menacingly. One of them holds a saw blade, which he scratches the back of his neck with, and flings it at one of the male students, which cuts through the middle of his head. The second comes in and approaches a girl, who backs away to a tree, and stabs her throat. A blonde girl goes running through the woods and falls down a hill. Crawling away and hiding behind a log, she is found by one of the killers and watches as the weapon comes down.The flashback ends with Chad saying there no bodies were found and only one lone survivor lived to tell the story. The whole group looks mortified and terrified until Mike comes in and says that there is a lake nearby and asks if they wanted to go skinny dipping. Relieved by the dramatic tension, they all agree. It gets dark and Tucker and Dale is shown fishing on a boat out on the lake. Dale and Tucker reach in their cooler to see that there is only one beer left, in which Dale gives to Tucker, who then advises him to ""stand up for himself"" after calling him hopeless. Allison prepares to go skinny dipping and hears a noise. Turning around, she sees that it is Chad scaring her with an axe. She is easily turned off by it but it approached by the drunk Chad, who begins to tell her to ""drop the act"" of pretending to be better than everybody. He then confesses that he's glad the two get to spend time together before trying to kiss her. Allison backs away, telling him he's drunk, which he says is a good thing as it lowers his ""inhibition."" He then tries kissing her again which makes Allison push him away again before leaving.The rest of the students take off their clothes and drop into the lake, which captures the attention of Tucker and Dale, who can easily see from a distance a topless Chloe. Dale is immediately put off at the thought of being near them while Tucker tries to row the boat closer to get a better look. Dale attempts to row the other way until Tucker catches glimpse of Allison taking off her clothes, save for her bra and panties, on top of a rock. Dale looks away and tells Tucker to row the boat and calls him a Peeping Tom. Allison begins climbing down the rock until Dale accidentally shouts Tucker's name, which prompts her to turn around and slip in fear, hitting her head as she falls down into the lake. Tucker and Dale briefly argue before they realize she isn't getting back up. The two row their boat to the spot where she fell and Dale dives in to save her. From a distance, Chloe sees Dale bringing up an unconscious Allison to their boat and screams out in terror. Tucker calls out to the college students, ""We got your friend!"" Taking this as a menacing threat, the students run away, which confuses the two hillbillies. Deciding to take the unconscious Allison back to their cabin, hoping that her friends will come by and pick her up in the morning, the two row away.Chad is shown again, drunk, back at the campsite, throwing his axe at a tree as target practice. The frightened students tell Chad that they saw the two hillbillies take Allison away. He picks up his axe and runs to the shore, but it is too late as the two hillbillies carry the girl off into the fog. Next morning, Allison wakes up with a bandage wrapping around her head, dazed and confused upon looking inside the cabin. She spots the bones and a mean-looking, one-eyed dog across the room. Dale then comes in, which terrifies the young girl, and panics the shy hillbilly, who only came in to give her pancakes. Assuming she didn't like them, he goes back to make something else. Meanwhile, the college students are discussing what they thought they saw when Allison was being carried away, with Chuck saying that it looked like ""one of them was eating her face"", an obvious misinterpretation of CPR. Naomi then suggests calling the police, which Chad disagrees with, seeing it as a chance to fight evil without any rules or regulations, remarking ""it's us against them."" Chuck volunteers to take his father's truck to find help, which Chad is put off by but says he can leave if he wants to. Chuck runs off much to Chloe's dismay.Jason spots the cabin around the corner and alerts his friends. They all fear approaching the cabin, save for Mitchell who claims that they may not be psycho killers. Chloe then suggests he should just walk up and knock on their door, which Mitchell snarks at but reveals he is also afraid. Back in the cabin, Dale returns with eggs and bacon and gives it to Allison. The two talk for awhile, in which Dale says the cabin is Tucker's new vacation home, introduces himself, and the mean, one-eyed dog, named Jangers, who is actually sweet and tender. He tells her she hit her head after she slipped into the lake and Tucker and Dale rescued her from drowning. He then says her friends ran off, which he takes it as an immediate reaction to a sudden crisis, and hopes they'll return to pick her up. Throughout their conversation, Dale shows his anxiety from talking to a high-class woman and attempts to clean the place up. Allison asks if there is anything fun to do in the meantime, which Dale suggests a board game, Trivi-Up.Back to the college students, Chad, Mitchell, Mike, and Todd play rock, paper, scissors to send of their own to the cabin to investigate. Mitchell loses. He fearfully approaches the cabin while Tucker prepares a chainsaw to cut through some wood. He looks up and spots Dale and Allison playing the board game and having fun, which he enviously claims ""Damn Romeo."" He begins cutting through the wood, not knowing a bee hive is hiding within, which he accidentally cuts through. The bees swarm Tucker, which prompts him to swing his chainsaw madly and run from them. Mitchell spots this and mistakes this as being attacked. He yells at his friends to run before running off into the woods himself, with Tucker following. The two run deep until they both turn to briefly look at each other before Mitchell runs straight into a large tree branch, which impales him through his gut. Tucker continues running away from the bees. A dying Mitchell spots a lone bee hovering near him and has a look of realization before dying.Meanwhile, Allison and Dale continue their game of Trivi-Up, where Dale reveals that he has a weird brain, in which he's extremely dumb but can remember everything he hears. Allison remarks that he isn't dumb and that makes him quite brilliant, telling him there is a difference between education and intellect. She tells Dale that she plans on getting a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. She admits that it's a dumb dream but Dale professes that dreams aren't dumb and supports her. Tucker then comes in, swollen-faced and angry at Dale for not helping him. He goes to the cooler to wash his face with beer as Dale goes to take out the stingers. He tells Allison that he saw her friend out there, running away, which he assumed must be because he was allergic to bees. Allison tries to go out there and find them but Dale tells her to rest and that both Tucker and himself will find them.The college students find Mitchell's body hanging from the branch and see it as a warning from the hillbillies to stay out of their woods. This provokes Chad even further into insanity by breaking Chloe's phone and throwing his axe, which nearly hits Jason. They then hear Tucker and Dale approaching and hide behind a tree. They listen in on a conversation of Dale beating Allison at a game of Trivi-Up and mistakes it as him torturing their friend. Tucker then calls out ""College kids!"" which terrifies them. He repeatedly calls them out louder, until the two decide to leave them a message with Chad's axe in case they return. Dale engraves a message on to the log and leaves behind the axe. When the coast is clear, the college kids walk up to see the message: WE GOT UR FREIND.At the cabin, Tucker is chipping away wood via the wood chipper while Dale digs a hole for the outhouse. Allison, who re-fashioned Dale's clothes to fit her, approaches him and volunteers to help out, which Dale refuses, but is surprised to see the high-class college girl able to dig at an outhouse hole. She confesses she grew up on a farm and had to work there. The college students return, hiding behind some bushes and see Allison digging away at a hole while Dale watches in amazement. They quickly assume she is digging her own grave. Todd holds his spear, Chad readies his axe, and Mike prepares his pocket knife, and they split up into three groups, with Mike, Chloe, and Naomi going after Tucker, Todd going after Dale, and Chad and Jason remain where they are. Once they all get into position, Chad makes his call to charge, which catches Dale's attention and sees Chloe and Naomi from a distance. He calls out to them as Allison hears Todd charging at Dale with a makeshift spear. She calls out Dale's name, which makes him turn to see Todd before accidentally knocking Allison out with his shovel and slipping into the outhouse hole next to an unconscious Allison. Todd then trips on a branch, flings the spear next to Dale and falls onto it.As this is occurring, Mike sneaks behind Tucker, who is still casually throwing wood into the wood chipper and takes out his pocket knife. He flings forward, preparing to stab him, but timed it wrong when Tucker bent down to pick up another log and falling head first into the wood chipper. Tucker panics as blood spurts out and splatters all over Chloe. He grabs hold of the legs and tries to pull Mike out but to no avail. The machine shuts down and a frightened Tucker ignorantly asks ""Are you okay?"" before frustratingly kicking the machine.Dale, covered in Todd's blood, runs into the cabin with an unconscious Allison and panics at what he just saw. Tucker follows, covered in Mike's blood. The two panic and contemplate that the college students must be some sort of psychotic suicide pact and runs around the woods killing themselves. They hide all the sharp objects in hopes of avoiding anymore needless deaths. Dale suggests calling the cops but Tucker claims that it will only bring more trouble as it can label the two as killers, adding that only a moron would believe college kids are killing themselves in their property. Tucker then suggests hiding the bodies.The college kids regroup, with Chloe desperately trying to light a cigarette while covered in Mike's blood and Naomi asking why didn't they go for help before, all the while Chad is casually sharpening his axe. They all agree to go get help except for Chad, who wants to continue his survival game. He remarks that it is ""us against them"" and says that they must destroy evil in order to live and anyone who tries to run deserves to die, which disgusts Jason. Suddenly, they hear sirens from the distance. Chuck is inside the passenger seat of the cop car, the same one that pulled Tucker and Dale over, and brakes upon seeing Chloe approach them. Naomi, Chloe, and Jason hurry into the back with Chad cursing at them from afar and running off on his own.Tucker and Dale, in the meantime, try to get Mike's lower half out of the wood chipper, which makes Dale very queasy. The successfully take it out and drag it out only to see the cop car stop in front of them. The sheriff tells the kids to stay in the car while he goes and takes care of business. He then begins to interrogate the two hillbillies, with Tucker doing most of the talking. Without a proper excuse, Tucker merely comes out with the truth: that the college kids are psychos and are killing themselves all over their property. An afraid Dale begins to blabber out that Allison, who is inside their bedroom, unconscious in their cabin, can tell him, which frustrates Tucker and makes the sheriff that much more suspicious. The two lead him into the cabin which makes the college kids panic.Inside, the sheriff investigates Allison's conditions and says she's not braindead and will recover. He then tells the two that he warned them about the woods and told them to stay away. The sheriff confesses that the two could be taken in for involuntary manslaughter, if they are lucky, and as he is saying this, he leans on the weak wooden pillar, which Tucker and Dale both warn him about, but is too late as the beam comes flying down with the nailed board and impales the sheriff through the head. Still alive and managing to step outside, the sheriff lugs to his car as Tucker, Dale, and the college kids look on in fear, and attempts to call for help via radio before falling dead. Dale and Tucker argue over fixing that beam while Naomi, Chloe, and Jason panic from the back as they are locked inside. Chuck, from the passenger seat, spots the sheriff's gun and runs outside to shoot at the two hillbillies. Seeing that the gun isn't firing, Dale, in panic, suggests that the safety might still be on and Chuck stupidly turns the gun around for the safety and points the barrel towards his head, accidentally pulling the trigger as he turns off the safety. Goodbye Chuck.Tucker yells at the kids to be more careful as Chad comes in from behind, picks up the gun and starts shooting at them. Dale and Tucker run inside and lay on the ground in order to avoid the gunshots. Tucker blames Dale for the situation they're in and Dale responds by saying that they shouldn't have gone fishing, which he confesses to hate. This hurts Tucker's feelings. More shots are fired until they hear a dog bark outside. Tucker asks where Janger is which makes Dale panic, crawl towards the window, and see that Chad is holding the dog hostage, with the other three, now freed from the car, watching. Tucker then comes up with a plan to have Dale use the nail gun to create a distraction while Tucker himself goes outside and frees Janger. The two make their move as Dale shoots the nail gun close to the kids but not at them. Tucker runs around from behind and uses camouflage to reach Janger. As both Dale and Chad shoot at each other, Tucker successfully reaches Janger as Chad runs out of bullets and threatens Dale's dog. Tucker frees Janger but is caught by the ignorant college kids.Tucker runs into the woods in fear and is chased by the kids. He hides behind a log, much like the woman in the Memorial Day Massacre, and attempts to camouflage. It works until Chad spots him and knocks him out with a punch. Moments later, Tucker wakes up to see himself dangling upside down from a tree. He remarks to them ""what the hell is wrong with you kids?"" which provokes Chad, who tells Jason to hold him steady, and says that Tucker is pure evil before proceeding to chop off his finger for their fallen friends.Back in the cabin, Allison wakes up to see Dale wiping her head and covered in blood. She asks what happened and Dale cannot seem to tell her, crying in shock and anxiety. She comforts him and calms him down. Dale then asks if her friends are crazy before telling her that they have been killing themselves, then tried to kill Tucker and himself, before trying to kill his dog. She then remembers Todd running at them with a spear and begins to look confused. Dale says that her friends seem to enjoy killing and panics when the door starts banging. She tries to calm him down by saying her friends would never hurt anybody but then hears Chad scream ""Die hillbilly!"" from the outside. She goes out to check and sees the corpses of the sheriff and her friends and is repulsed. She looks down to see a bloodied cloth on the doorstep. Allison comes back in and Dale recognizes the cloth to belong to Tucker's shirt. They unwrap it to see two bloody fingers and a note. The note says: NOW WE GOT YOUR FRIEND. TRY AND GET HIM BACK.Dale musters up his courage and decides to go out and save Tucker. He grabs a machete and prepares to walk out. Allison tries to stop him saying they shouldn't instigate things and defends her friends by saying that they must be trying to protect her. Dale gets offended and asks why they would think such things. Allison confesses it is because he is a hillbilly, and both her and her friends misjudged him. Dale seems to accept this and depresses him. Before he departs, he asks Allison to tell her friends he is harmless and never wanted to hurt anybody.Dale goes out into the woods, calling out Tucker's name and holding his machete. He comes across puddles of blood and Tucker's hat and sees the corpse of Mitchell, still dangling from the branch. Shaken, Dale presses onward when he hears Tucker respond to his calls. He sees Tucker dangling upside down and approaches him. As he's walking, Tucker tells him it's a trap and Dale accidentally sets it off. Thankfully, he stood still and the makeshift spear only cut through his pants leg. He cuts down Tucker, who falls headfirst onto the ground and comments that their vacation sucks.Night comes, and Chad and Naomi sneak into the cabin, looking for Allison. They creep in and see her standing in the bedroom and whispers to her. When they are notified that nobody else is home, they calm down and speak normally. Chad asks her what they did to her, which she replies that she is perfectly fine and all this has been a huge misunderstanding. Chad ignores this and proceeds to burn the cabin down. Allison yells at him to stop and that it is their vacation home. Chad becomes enraged and tries to persuade Allison that Tucker and Dale are evil men and that he was trying to save her. She retorts by saying they saved her life. Naomi makes a comment that Allison developed Stockholm Syndrome, which angers Chad. He questions Allison on whether if she has truly fallen in love with Dale. He lunges at her with his axe until Tucker and Dale rush in to save her. They both prepare to lunge at each other with their weapons until Allison comes between them and sways them both to calm down, sit, and drink tea (which Tucker makes a sarcastic remark that he'll bring out the finger sandwiches).She sits Chad on one end of the table and Dale on the other and begins serving them tea. Chad asks her if it's Chamomile Tea and says that he cannot drink it if it is as it'll harm his asthma. She says it's Earl Grey. After serving tea, she begins the therapy session. She will allow both sides to tell their sides of the story and to consider their perspective. Chad complies and begins way back before he was born, twenty years ago, during the Memorial Day Massacre.His parents were among the partying college kids who were killed by the two hillbillies. His mother, revealed to be the blonde woman who ran away into the woods only to be caught by one of them, was the lone survivor of the massacre. She was brought back to camp, where she lied next to her lover, Chad's father, who didn't know she was pregnant with Chad, and reached for a knife in the toolbox next to her. With it, she tried freeing him. When one of the hillbillies tried grabbing her, she stabbed him in the leg and escaped. This caused the hillbillies to throw Chad's father into an incinerator and watched him burn to death. The woman eventually birthed Chad and had to be institutionalized afterwards. He heard the story from his grandmother.As the flashback ends and Chad explains why he holds deep hatred towards hillbillies, Dale defends himself and Tucker by saying they were much too young to be part of such an event and says that he's harmless, saying he can't even hurt a fish. Outside, Jason and Chloe sneak around to a window, claiming that if Chad and Naomi had not returned in fifteen minutes, the two of them would charge in. Allison asks how both of them feel after telling their stories, Dale admits he feels better. Suddenly, Jason barges in with a weed whacker and charges towards Tucker, who narrowly dodges the spinning blades. Jason accidentally strikes Naomi's face and begins mutilating her. Chad throws the table forward onto Dale and tries hacking him with an axe only to be punched by Tucker. Chad grabs a lit lamp and throws at the two, but misses and accidentally hits Jason's leg. He catches on fire and begins to panic, with Tucker and Dale advising him to stop, drop, and roll. Chloe grabs a jar and tries to douse the fire only to ignite Jason even further. He flings himself around madly and finally falls over, burning to death, and igniting the gasoline Chad was pouring moments earlier. Shocked, Chloe lights a cigarette next to piles of gasoline cans, which Dale admits that he should've moved those earlier. Tucker, Dale, and Allison make a run for it, followed by Chad but is held by Naomi, who is begging for his help. The cabin explodes as the three narrowly make it out, killing Jason, Chloe, Chad, and Naomi. Tucker and Dale stare shocked at their vacation home incinerating and Allison states that she is a terrible therapist, which Dale disagrees with. Just as things calmed down, Chad emerges, half of his body burned. The three run to the pickup truck and try to start the truck as Chad slowly limps to them, axe in hand. They finally get it started and drive away. As Dale mocks the college kids, he loses his focus and drives into a tree.Dale wakes up with Janger licking him and sees that Allison is missing and Tucker lying beside a tree, bleeding heavily. He approaches his friend and tries to help him. He tells Dale that Chad took Allison away and to go after her, much to Dale's dismay. He admits to him that he was always better at everything and he sees the way Allison and Dale look at each other. Proclaiming their friendship, Dale promises to return for Tucker and runs off with Janger, who can lead him to Allison.Come sun rise, Dale and Janger reach an abandoned lumber mill. He leaves behind Janger and presses on alone. Chad tied Allison up to a log next to a saw, ala a classical Western villain. He says that she turned hillbilly on him and if she begs and apologizes, he will let her go, and kisses her. Feeling that the kiss wasn't right, he decides to give her a second shot and licks her face. He hears banging from outside and smiles. Outside, Dale breaks open the tool shed and straps himself up with various weapons. He equips himself with a welder's mask and a chainsaw before charging in. Inside, Allison gets frightened by Dale's appearance and he reveals himself to her. Using a knife, he attempts to cut the ropes, while Chad starts the intercom and begins making threats to Dale and Allison. The machine starts and the log Allison is tied slowly begins to saw it vertically in half. Dale continues to struggle with the ropes until Chad appears and attacks Dale. He throws his axe at him but misses and the two fight each other, Chad with a metal pipe and Dale with his chainsaw. Chad gains the upper hand until Dale stabs him in the leg with a knife strapped to his boot and elbows him in the stomach, reaches forward, grabs the axe, and with a lucky throw, cuts Allison's ropes loose. With the girl away from danger, Chad and Dale continue their fight. Dale throws his chainsaw at him to keep him off-balance.Allison and Dale run upstairs and locks the door behind them. Dale looks around for something to stab Chad with while something catches Allison's eye. Allison calls out to Dale as he looks at a box of Chamomile Tea and shows him an old newspaper. The headline states that one of the killers of the Memorial Day Massacre was caught by some policemen, one of them happening to be the same sheriff back at the cabin. The killer bared strong resemblance with Chad. It is revealed through the article that the survivor was tortured and raped before being freed.Chad suddenly emerges with the chainsaw and threatens the two. Dale is knocked to the ground and just as when Chad prepared for the killing blow, Dale shows him the newspaper article and says that he too is hillbilly. Refusing to accept this, Allison remarks that he is indeed ""half hillbilly."" Just as Chad is occupied with the newspaper article, Dale attempts to grab hold of the box of Chamomile Tea. Chad grows angry and proclaims that ""everything is a lie"" and lunges forward. Dale grabs some of the tea powder and flings it at Chad. His asthma begins to act up and Dale reveals that he won't be harmed just as Chad steps backwards through a window and falls to the ground. Allison and Dale look down and sees Chad presumably dead.Night comes as a squadron of cops investigate the mill. The reporter and her cameraman that appeared in the beginning of the film report a mass suicide of college students and a deranged killer that is responsible for it remains at large. Tucker watches this as he recovers from a hospital. Dale comes in, clean and well-groomed, and sees how his friend is doing. Tucker reveals he got his fingers back, and high from prescription medication, realizes that one of his fingers look different. It appears as though they got Chloe's finger with a red painted nail and mistook it as Tucker's and sewed it onto him. Dale brings his friend cold beer with a bendy straw and reveals that he is going out bowling with Allison. Tucker congratulates his friend for overcoming his fear of women.At the bowling alley, Allison proves to be a fantastic bowler. One of Dale's friend, BJ, who seeks advice on how to get women such as Allison to like him, asks Dale for help, who gives him the same advice Tucker gave him a few days earlier. He directs BJ to go talk to one of the young woman playing with her friends not so far away. As he leaves, Allison and Dale are left by themselves. Dale gives Allison a gift: a pink helmet that suits her accident-prone nature, and the two confess love for each other before kissing. In the back, BJ accidentally knocks out one of the women and starts to carry her but the two continue kissing."
Happythankyoumoreplease,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1481572/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Captures a generational moment - young people on the cusp of truly growing up, tiring of their reflexive cynicism, each in their own ways struggling to connect and define what it means to love and be loved. Six New Yorkers juggle love, friendship, and the keenly challenging specter of adulthood. Sam Wexler is a struggling writer who's having a particularly bad day. When a young boy gets separated from his family on the subway, Sam makes the questionable decision to bring the child back to his apartment and thus begins a rewarding, yet complicated, friendship. Sam's life revolves around his friends-Annie, whose self-image keeps her from commitment; Charlie and Mary Catherine, a couple whose possible move to Los Angeles tests their relationship; and Mississippi, a cabaret singer who catches Sam's eye.—Sundance Film Festival The parallel stories of three connected thirty-something angst-filled New Yorkers are presented. Sam Wexler, a short story writer, has just completed and is peddling his first novel to his publisher, the meeting which does not go well on several levels. Simultaneously, he enters into two distinctly different relationships which pulls him in different directions, both relationships mostly of his own choosing. One is with Rasheed, an adolescent he ends up ""adopting"" by chance, Rasheed's true background unclear in he only stating that he doesn't want ""to go back"" in the implication that he is in foster care. The other is with Mississippi, an aspiring singer working as a bar server, she to who he is immediately attracted but who he may have a struggle maintaining a relationship with, their time together much like the comfort he has in writing short stories as compared to the long haul of a novel. Annie, Sam's best friend, suffers from alopecia, which is only one of the reasons for her insecurities about herself. As such, she tends to choose the wrong men, such as ex-boyfriend Ira. A series of items makes her look at her persistent work colleague, a lawyer also named Sam - hence her referral to him as Sam #2 - in a different way, he who she previously dissuaded in any way she could in he not being normally her type. And Mary Catherine, Sam's ""cousin"" (i.e. they grew up with their respective parents as best friends), is a committed New Yorker, the city part of how she defines herself despite not taking advantage of all that the city has to offer.

Sam wakes to Annie, a friend with alopecia areata (an autoimmune disorder that has made her lose all her hair) calling to remind him about a party she is hosting, and telling him which clothes to wear. Sam, during the message quickly preps for a meeting, calls Annie from his celular phone to tell her he messed up, slept late and ruined his life. She assures him he will be fine. He promises to be early to her party.Enroute to his meeting, Sam, realizes a boy is separated from his family & tries to take him to the police, where the boy resists.

Sam interrupts the meeting to grab the boy and sit him on the couch in the in the office with sam, which promptly terminates the interview. As Sam and the boy is leaving the secretary says bye to ""Rasheen"", the boy.On the way home Rasheen says he is thirsty, and Sam uses this as an excuse to enter a bar where a red head he is interested in works. Sam uses the opportunity, and Rasheen, as an excuse to break the ice with the girl (Mississippi, from Mississippi).When sam cannot get any information from Rasheen, he goes to Annie's party with the boy and meets with his cousin, Mary Catherine, who's boyfriend, Charlie is in Los Angeles on business. During the party, Annie reveals her disorder as Mary gets a call from Charlie, where it is revealed that Charlie loves Los Angeles and it is suggested that Mary hates it.Sam ends up going to see Mississippi at the bar while Rasheen sleeps on his couch, learns that Mississippi is a singer and refuses to go see her in case she is not a good singer, because he readily admits he likes her and thinks she is great.

The Killer Inside Me,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0954947/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A West Texas Deputy Sheriff is slowly unmasked as a psychotic killer. Sadism and masochism beneath a veneer of revenge. Lou Ford is a mild-mannered sheriff's deputy in a Texas oil town in the mid 1950's. His boss sends him to roust a prostitute living in a rural house. She slaps him; he hits her, then, after daily sex for the next few weeks, he decides it's love. She's devoted to him and becomes his pawn in a revenge plot she thinks is to shakedown the son of Chester Conway, the town's wealthy king of construction. Lou has a different plan, and bodies pile up as murder leads to murder. The district attorney suspects Lou, and Conway may have an inkling, but Lou stays cool. Is love, or at least peace, in the cards?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Deputy Sheriff Lou Ford (Casey Affleck) is a pillar of the community in his small west Texas town, patient, dependable, and well-liked. Beneath his pleasant facade, however, he is a sociopath with violent sexual tastes. As a teenager, Lou was caught raping a five-year-old girl by Mike, his older step-brother. Mike pleaded guilty to the crime and served prison time to protect Lou. After being released, Mike was hired by the construction firm of Chester Conway (Ned Beatty). One day on the job, Mike had a fatal accident. Lou believes that Conway planned the accident.At the prodding of Sheriff Bob Maples (Tom Bower), Lou visits Joyce Lakeland (Jessica Alba), a prostitute who is having an affair with Conway's son, Elmer (Jay R. Ferguson). When Joyce objects to Lou's treatment of her and slaps him, he throws her on the bed and uses his belt buckle for a spanking until her buttocks are bruised and bleeding. Joyce enjoys pain, and she and Lou begin a passionate love affair.Joyce suggests that Lou would never leave town with her, but they devise a plot to extort $10,000 from the Conways. Sheriff Maples and Chester Conway ask Lou to oversee the payoff. Lou has another plan: He viciously beats Joyce, intending to kill her. When Elmer arrives, Lou shoots and kills him. He then plants the gun on Joyce, hoping to make the scene look like a murder/suicide. Joyce survives, however, and Conway announces his intention to see her executed for killing Elmer.Lou's reputation begins to falter: His longtime girlfriend, Amy (Kate Hudson), suspects he is cheating on her, and the county district attorney, Howard Hendricks (Simon Baker), suspects that Lou could be behind the murders. Lou is asked to join Sheriff Maples and Conway in taking Joyce to a hospital in Fort Worth where doctors can operate on her; Conway wants her alive so he can interrogate her as soon as possible. Lou waits in a hotel room while the surgery takes place. A shaken Maples arrives to tell him that Joyce died on the operating table. Lou and Maples return to west Texas by train.While browsing his father's books at home, Lou discovers some nude photographs of a woman that were hidden in a Bible. The woman was Helene, a housekeeper and babysitter in his youth who bears a strong resemblance to Joyce. Lou recalls that Helene introduced him to sadomasochism, urging him to strike her and proclaiming that she loved pain. Lou burns the photos.Hendricks arrests a local youth, Johnnie Pappas (Liam Aiken), as a suspect in the murders of Elmer and Joyce. He was found with one of the $20 bills Elmer was to give Joyce in the payoff; Conway had the bills marked in order to blackmail Joyce if she didn't leave town. Because Lou is close to Johnnie, Hendricks asks Lou to persuade him to confess. But it was Lou who had given Johnnie the marked $20 bill after taking it from Elmer. Lou confesses to Johnnie, who promises to protect him. Lou hangs Johnnie, making it look like a suicide.Johnnie's death only makes the town more suspicious of Lou. Journalist and union organizer Joe Rothman (Elias Koteas) implies that he knows Lou killed Elmer and Joyce and suggests Lou leave town. Amy persuades him to elope and acquiesces to his desire to spank her roughly in bed. At first Lou is satisfied, but his homicidal urges begin to resurface and he contemplates killing Amy.An alcoholic bum whom Lou had previously brutalized (Brent Briscoe) says he knows Lou committed the murders and expects $5,000 to keep quiet. Lou asks him to come back in two weeks, when he and Amy plan to elope. That day, Lou beats Amy to death, then chases the bum down the street, accusing him of the crime. The bum is killed by another deputy, Jeff Plummer (Matthew Maher).The next morning, Plummer appears on Lou's porch to tell him that Maples committed suicide, heartbroken over Lou's crimes. Hendricks and Plummer try to get a confession from Lou, who cockily refuses. They have a letter that Amy intended to give him before they eloped, in which Amy begs him to come clean. Lou is arrested and sent to an insane asylum.After a few weeks, a slick lawyer, Billy Boy Walker (Bill Pullman), has him released and drives him home. Knowing that the authorities probably have evidence against him and that the evidence could only be Joyce, who did not die after all Lou begins to plot his own death.Joyce, now able to walk but still bearing the scars of that brutal night, is brought to Lou's house. She tells Lou that she refused to cooperate with the authorities because she loves him. Lou says he loves her, too and then stabs her. Plummer opens fire, igniting the gasoline and alcohol Lou has spread around the house and causing an explosion that kills everyone inside."

Ip Man 2,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386932/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Centering on Ip Man's migration to Hong Kong in 1949 as he attempts to propagate his discipline of Wing Chun martial arts. Ip Man 2 is a 2010 Hong Kong biographical martial arts film loosely based on the life of Ip Man, a grandmaster of the martial art Wing Chun. A sequel to the 2008 film Ip Man, the film was directed by Wilson Yip, and stars Donnie Yen, who reprises the leading role. Continuing after the events of the earlier film, the sequel centers on Ip's movements in Hong Kong, which is under British colonial rule. He attempts to propagate his discipline of Wing Chun, but faces rivalry from other practitioners, including the local master of Hung Ga martial arts.—jck movies In 1950, Yip Man (1893-1972) has left Foshun for Hong Kong. With his wife expecting their second child, Yip opens a martial arts school to teach Wing Chun. Things start slowly and even when he has students, Yip doesn't always collect tuition. Yip also runs afoul of the local guild of martial arts masters: they demand that he defeat each of them before they will let his school continue; the elder of the group, Master Hong Zhen Nan, also demands a sizable payment. Yip is defiant. Then, things go terribly wrong with the British when their boxing champion insults Chinese martial arts at a public demonstration. Master Hong steps up to defend Chinese honor, but will that be enough?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Having defeated the best fighters of the Imperial Japanese army in occupied Shanghai, Ip Man (Yen) and his family settle in post-war Hong Kong. Struggling to make a living, Master Ip opens a kung fu school to bring his celebrated art of Wing Chun to the troubled youth of Hong Kong. His growing reputation soon brings challenges from powerful enemies, including pre-eminent Hung Gar master, Hung Quan (Hung). Wing Chun master Ip Man (Donnie Yen) and his family move to Hong Kong in the mid-1940s after their escape from Japanese-occupied Foshan. There, Ip desires to open a school to propagate his art, as well as make a living during the difficult times, but he has difficulty attracting students due to his lack of reputation in the city. One day, a young man named Wong Leung (Huang Xiaoming) appears and promptly challenges Ip to a fight, but is easily defeated. Wong leaves humiliated, only to return with some friends to gang up on him. Ip beats them as well. Stunned and impressed by his skills, Wong and his friends become Ip's first students, bringing more disciples to help the school thrive.Wong is later caught posting promotional posters for the school by some Hung Ga students. One of them challenges Wong to a fight and loses, but his friends take Wong hostage in revenge and demand a ransom from Ip. Ip goes to the local wet market as directed, but the meeting ends in a confrontation with a growing mob of Hung Ga students. Ip and Wong fight their way outside to meet Jin Shanzhao, a martial artist and former bandit, who comes to their rescue with his own gang. The students' master and head of the coalition of Hong Kong martial arts clubs, Hung Chun-Nam (Sammo Hung), arrives to break up the fight. Ip introduces himself, and Hung informs him that before setting up a school, he needs to attend a special fighting ceremony to test his worth. Ip, Wong and Jin are subsequently arrested by Officer Fatso for disturbing the peace but are later released on bail. Hung and Fatso are then shown to be acting as reluctant collectors for the martial arts schools (including Hung's) as part of a protection racket headed by Superintendent Wallace, a corrupt officer in the Hong Kong police.
Hung tells IP Man that to open his school Ip would have to attend a ceremony of all martial arts masters in HK and defeat them.Ip attends the ceremony and defeats his first challengers, before striking a draw with the last challenger, Hung. Ip is allowed to keep running his school on the condition that he pay his monthly protection fees, but he declines. Hung thus has his students loiter in front of the Wing Chun School and harass anyone interested, causing a street brawl between them and Ip's disciples. Ip is thus forced to close up and move the school nearer to home. Ip soon confronts Hung, who blames him since he wouldn't pay his protection fees, whereas Ip criticizes Hung's management of his students. Hung insists that he is doing what he must and also insists they finish their fight, but during this encounter, Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking his son as he suddenly appears, earning respect from him. Ip leaves, and the next day, Hung invites him to a British boxing match he has helped to set up, quietly coming to terms with him.The boxing competition allows for a demonstration by the various martial arts schools to help promote themselves and their Chinese culture. However, the event's star boxer, Taylor ""The Twister"" Miller (Darren Shahlavi), an arrogant, racist and brutal man, openly insults and attacks the students, causing chaos as the masters try to restore order. Hung accepts Twister's challenge to a fight so that he can defend his culture. Although Hung has the upper hand at first due to his wider range of skills, in the second round he suffers a devastating blow that severely disorientates him. As he fights on, he begins to weaken from his asthma and is eventually beaten to death by Twister, as he refuses to concede and allow the man to insult his culture and people. News of Hung's death rapidly spreads throughout the enraged Chinese populace, causing a scandal that spurs Wallace to hold a press conference where he lies that Hung's death was an accident and that he was a weakling who died after a few punches. Twister announces that in order to clear his name he will accept any challenge from the Chinese to participate in a fair, public boxing match, but proceeds to proclaim that he could kill every Chinese boxer in Hong Kong and that he doubts any of the Chinese are brave enough to fight him. Ip Man has already arrived to challenged Twister to a fight.As his wife goes into labor, Ip finishes training and begins his fight with Twister. Ip exchanges blows with the boxer and seems overwhelmed by the westerner's sheer muscle at first, but begins to make a comeback using his more diverse techniques and great speed. He receives an illegal punch from Twister after the second round's bell, and is also told that kicks would not be allowed due to the judges changing the rules during the match. When it looks like the end, Ip remembers Hung's patriotic spirit and is spurred to go on. He changes his strategy and attacks the boxer's arms to disable him. The fight is brought to a climactic finish as Ip Man rains blow after blow into the knocked-down Twister's face, with flashbacks reflecting the latter's killing of Master Hung. While the Chinese celebrate, Wallace is arrested by his superiors for corruption, as Fatso has secretly reported him. Ip then gives a speech to the audience, stating that despite the differences between their race and culture, he wishes for everyone to respect each other regardless of their status. Both the Western and Chinese audience give him a standing ovation while Twister's manager walks away, unhappy at the defeat. Ip goes home and reunites with his family, including his newborn second son, Ip Ching.A final scene shows Ip being introduced to a boy named Bruce Lee who wishes to study Wing Chun in order to ""beat up people he doesn't like"". Ip smiles and simply tells the boy to ""come back when he is older""."

Nine-year-old Mary lives in a home filled with lovely things and loneliness. Bothered by bratty brother Max and neglected by well intentioned, but distracted, parents, she yearns for companionship and adventure. On Christmas Eve, Mary's beloved Uncle Albert arrives with the gift of a wooden nutcracker doll. Later that night, Mary's imagination brings the doll to life. Introducing himself as ""NC,"" he takes her on a wondrous journey through a stunning dimension where toys assume human form and everything appears ten times larger. But danger lurks. An army of toothy rat creatures, led by the flamboyant Rat King and his devious mother, has unleashed a plot to overthrow humanity. When NC is captured and placed under a paralytic spell, Mary, Max and a spirited band of toy sidekicks must rescue him from the Rat King's clutches and thwart his wicked plans to 'ratify' the world.—Anonymous From the imagination of acclaimed Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky, the cherished story of The Nutcracker will be brought to life in spectacular 3D this holiday season. THE NUTCRACKER IN 3D follows nine-year-old Mary (Elle Fanning) whose dull Viennese Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her beloved Uncle Albert (Nathan Lane) and his gift of an enchanted nutcracker. On Christmas night, Mary's new friend, The Nutcracker (Charlie Rowe) or ""NC,"" comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey into his magical world of fairies, sugarplums, and other Christmas toys which come to life. Mary soon realizes that this fantastical kingdom is facing danger from the tyrannical rule of the evil Rat King (John Turturro) and his devious mother (Frances de la Tour). When NC is taken hostage, Mary and her newfound toy friends must uncover the secret of the Rat King to rescue NC and his kingdom. Based on the story that inspired acclaimed Russian composer Piotr Tchaikovsky to create the music for the iconic ballet, the film includes eight exciting new songs penned by Oscar-winning lyricist and librettist Sir Tim Rice (The Lion King, Evita, Jesus Christ Superstar).—Freestyle Releasing The movie is set in 1920s Vienna at Christmas time. Mary (Elle Fanning) lives with her parents (Richard E. Grant and Julia Vysotskaya) and her younger brother Max (Aaron Michael Drozin). She is upset that evening because her parents are going to a party that night, while Mary wants the whole family to be together for Christmas. However she is cheered up by her visiting Uncle Albert (Nathan Lane) who gives both her and Max a beautiful dolls house and a nutcracker doll nicknamed NC, whom Mary immediately takes a liking to.
That night, NC (voiced by Shirley Henderson) comes to life in front of Mary and grows to human height. He tells her that he must talk to his friends in the doll house, which is in the sitting room by the Christmas tree. They go downstairs and Mary finds that the sitting room has grown to an enormous size (or they have grown smaller) so that they appear to be the height of toys. In the dolls house Mary meets NCs friends; Gielgud, a gentlemanly chimpanzee; Tinker, a pernickety opera singer and Sticks, a drummer boy. After climbing the Christmas tree, Mary meets the Snow Fairy, who resembles her mother. The Snow Fairy tells Mary that NC is in fact a prince who had his kingdom taken over by the anthropomorphic Rat King ( John Turturro) and his cruel mother, The Rat Queen (Frances de la Tour), who was also the one that turned him into a nutcracker. She manages to turn him back into a boy (Charlie Rowe) temporarily, due to Mary truly believing in the magic that is happening. NC dances with Mary, they then climb to the top of the Christmas tree where he points out his city in the distance. Since NC was turned into a nutcracker, the Rat King has been oppressing his people, and forcing them to work in a number of nightmarish factories where the childrens toys are burnt to form a large black cloud over the city. He does this to block out sunlight, which he is afraid of. Mary suggests that they destroy the factories to scare him away. Unbeknownst to them, two of the Rat Kings spies who have seen them dancing, report back to tell the Rat King that NC is alive and a boy again. The Rat King gets his mother to turn NC back into a nutcracker, then sends his pack of Rat Dogs (robotic Rottweilers with sharp steel teeth) to cut down the Christmas tree. When the tree falls, Mary suddenly wakes up in her own bed and runs downstairs to get NC. Her parents do not believe her when she tells them the events of the night and disapprove of her wild imagination.
The next evening, NC comes to life again and tells Mary that he intends to round up an army to fight against the Rat King. Max wakes up, and excited to see NC alive, agrees to join the fight with them. NC goes downstairs ahead of them, to get the rest of the toys but is kidnapped. When Mary and Max go downstairs, they find that NC, Tinker and Sticks are being held captive in the fire place by the Rat King and his minions. After briefly tormenting them, he brings the toys and Max back to the city (Max goes willingly due to the promise of a Rat Bike). After they leave, Mary discovers Gielgud, who escaped capture. They find a portal to the city in the houses attic, and after stealing disguises from a rat, search the city for their friends. With the help from an old accordion player (who resembles Uncle Albert) they find the Rat King and Max in the city centre where even more toys are being taken from children to be burned. Max is horrified by this and asks to be returned home, but the Rat King imprisons him in his castle.
Mary attempts to save him but Gielgud stops her from blowing their cover. They manage to sneak into one of the smoke factories where they find Sticks, Tinker and an apparently lifeless NC. Sticks reveals that they had managed to escape from the Rat Kings clutches, but while escaping, NC was recaptured and they do not know what has been done to him. Mary rescues him from being burned and tells him that she loves him, which breaks the curse, bringing him back to life and turning him back into a boy permanently. The factory workers, seeing their prince alive, begin to fight back against the rats while Mary and NC attempt to shut down the factory. The Rat King and Rat Queen see that they will lose the war and decide to escape in a helicopter, kidnapping Mary and bringing her and Max with them. Gielgud and NC manage to board the helicopter and do battle with the Rat King while Max successfully manages to land the aircraft into a pile of toys. The Rat King and Queen escape by returning to their original rat forms and fleeing into the sewers. NC is crowned king and peace is restored in the kingdom as everyone celebrates. The Snow Fairy reappears and tells Mary it is time for her to go back home, though she is reluctant to leave. Before she goes, NC promises that they will meet again. Mary wakes up in her own room where her parents apologise for their earlier criticisms of her and promise to spend more time with her. She goes downstairs to Uncle Albert who introduces her to his new neighbour: a boy her age, who resembles the Nutcracker Prince and asks to be called NC. They soon become good friends, and the movie ends with them ice-skating together."

Victor follows a family line of professional assassins, and he completes his assignments quickly and without remorse. One afternoon, after killing one of his targets, he hesitates in killing the pet parrot, Roger, and instead takes him as a gift to his mother, Louisa (Eileen Atkins) a formidable woman who was, until recently, also Victor's housemate. In celebration of his 55th birthday, she gives him a leather bound book with newspaper clippings of each of his kills from his first to his most recent, leaving pages for future hits to be included. She also expresses concern that he might be gay, wondering why he hasn't produced a successor.Rose (Emily Blunt) is a not-so-average girl with a talent for thievery.

She starts playing games with the group who all think Matthew has lost it when they start to find signs of Jennifer around that appear to be left as a sign of the crime. Jennifer's first victim is Matthew, the slowest of the bunch who has a crush on her and is the only one that feels remorse for his actions. When she finally reveals herself to him in a cabin and invites him to sit on a couch next to her, he sobs and says he's sorry repeatedly as he clings to her waist and lies next to her. She listens for a time, then pulls a noose tight around his neck. As he struggles for air and again says he's sorry, her face crumples and she says that's not good enough, then drags him outside by the rope.Her second and third victims are the group's two lackeys. Stanley, the fat one, steps in a bear trap, and Andy, who gets knocked out with a baseball bat. Jennifer uses fish hooks to keep Stanley's eyes open while she pulls out a fish and guts it, and spreads the guts all over his face. This is all being recorded on his camera; the same camera he used to film her being raped. The fish guts attracts crows, who begin to peck on his face and eventually his eye balls. Andy is tied up lying on a few boards over a bath tub being filled with water. Jennifer throws in some lye and removes one of the boards forcing him to use his strength to stay out of the base.

Pretending to be his daughter's school teacher, she talks to him on the phone. The sheriff races home to find Jennifer is no longer there. He finds out she has taken his daughter to the playground. The sheriff races there to find no one, except Jennifer in the back seat of his cop car.After the sheriff wakes up from the blow from the tire iron, Jennifer talks about how nice his daughter seems and ignores for a while his entreaties not to hurt her, shoving a rifle barrel inside him as she tells him to imagine someone hurting his daughter the way they all hurt her. When he finally says, ""She's an innocent girl!"", she kneels beside him and says, ""So was I.'' (Note: the movie never shows his daughter again after this point and it's assumed she simply let her go home, only using her to bait the sheriff.) She then reveals she attached a string to the trigger and the other end has been tied around the unconcious Matthew's wrist. She walks out of the cabin with the sheriff shouting for help and cursing her out at the same time. Then Matthew wakes up and inspite of a failed attempt by the sheriff to calm Matthew down, Matthew moves, firing the shotgun, killing both the sheriff and Matthew. In the final shot, the calm and still Jennifer is then seen sitting on a tree trunk outside the cabin, slowly smiling when she hears the shot and realizes they're all finished."

Gabriel quits his architect job to become a playwright, writing about his life. Annie and Liz leave. Gabriel Richmond (Timothy Hutton) is a man who on the surface has it all-successful professional life as an architect, a beautiful wife, Annie (Dana Delany), and a devoted young daughter, Elizabeth (India Ennenga). But slowly it dawns on him that he is not really happy. Gabriel decides that he wants to write a play about the sorry state of his life. He quits his job, gets a pushy literary agent friend to represent him, and starts writing. Although his marriage ends in a divorce, the play is a success and although his life is different than it was, he is happier.—Brooks Branch This movie tells the story of Gabriel Richmond (Timothy Hutton), a man in his late forties, who is a successful architect. He begins questioning his life choices, which ultimately turns into an art form, as he goes from architect to playwright, examining his own life.—Brooks Branch It's New York City, 1979. Gabriel Richmond (Timothy Hutton) is a talented architect with a seemingly rich life as he has a caring wife, loving daughter, and life-long friends. Yet, he spends most days in the movie theater, hiding out from work, escaping into a fictional world where he can more readily relate to the made-up characters. When fiction shines a mirror on his own life, an inspired Gabriel begins writing a play not-so-loosely based on his reality, examining all of the relationships that make his life what it is. At first a hobby, the play begins to consume Gabriel's own self-examination. Slowly he realizes the fragility of his relationships and overall decisions in life, but does not know what to do with this information other than write about it. Gabriel's work eventually gains momentum just as his real-life begins to fall apart. Equipped with a hand-held tape recorder and typewriter, he begins a journey to re-author his own life, looking back on the pieces of his fractured self. He begins to see that life is not always as controlled as a play or movie and sometimes the best thing an author can do is let the characters speak for themselves. Emblematic of the self-discovery that was hatching in New York City (and many other cities) at the end of the 1970s, this movie shines a light on not only Gabriel's life, but also the complex people that make it up. From his wife and daughter to his colleagues at work and life-long best friend - Gabriel tries to understand these complex people who collectively make up too much of his own self worth.—Multiple Avenue Releasing"

Black Death,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1181791/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set during the time of the first outbreak of bubonic plague in England, a young monk is given the task of learning the truth about reports of people being brought back to life in a small village. Set during the time of the first outbreak of bubonic plague in England, a young monk is tasked with learning the truth about reports of people being brought back to life, a mission that pulls him toward a village ruler who has made a dark pact with evil forces.—Anonymous In medieval England fallen under the shadow of the Black Death, a young monk called Osmund is charged in leading a fearsome knight, Ulric and his group of mercenaries to a remote marsh. Their quest is to hunt down a necromancer - someone able to bring the dead back to life. Torn between his love of God and the love of a young woman, Osmund discovers the necromancer, a mysterious beauty called Langiva. After Langiva reveals her Satanic identity and offers Osmund his heart's desire, the horror of his real journey begins. In 1348, England is devastated by the Bubonic plague which spreads death across the lands and villages. The young monk, Osmund, asks his beloved Averill to travel with him to a remote village near the Dentwich Forest where the Black Death has not reached yet. She says that she will wait for him in the forest, but Osmund tells her that he will stay at the Staveley Monastery as he is a man of God. However, the emissary of the bishop Ulric arrives at the monastery recruiting a religious man to guide his soldiers and him through the forest and the swamp to the village. They believe that there is a necromancer resurrecting people and protecting the village from the plague. Along their journey, they fight against forest thieves and Osmund finds Averill's clothes dirty and bloody. When they reach the village, they find happy and healthy villagers that have renounced God but are living in peace, and they are welcomed by the leaders Hob and the alchemist Langiva.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Black Death begins with a voiceover from Wolfstan (John Lynch), a soldier in the employ of the Church in 13th Century England. As an enforcer of the Church's will, Wolfstan is one of a group who roots out and hunts down all traces of infidelity and sacrileges against God. The opening voiceover talks about the bubonic plague decimating life across England. Many people believe the plague is a divine punishment sent by God to scourge the unfaithful, but Wolfstan questions what amount of sin would warrant a punishment as cruel and merciless as the plague. He believes the plague is the result of people in league with the Devil, and he and his fellow soldiers must hunt down and destroy those devil worshipers responsible for the plague.Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) is a young novice monk going into a nearby town on an errand. He stops to see Averill (Kimberley Nixon), a beautiful young woman who is in love with him. Osmund convinces Averill to leave town because of the plague's spread. He wants her to run and hide in a forest. Averill begs Osmund to go with her, and tells him that she will wait one hour each day, at dawn, by a particular landmark in the forest, for one week. After that she will know he is not coming.Osmund is torn between his love for Averill and his vows to God. Back at his monastery, he falls to his knees and prays fervently for a sign that will help him choose.A day later, a troop of Church soldiers arrives at the monastery. The soldiers are led by Ulrich (Sean Bean), an aide to the local bishop. Ulrich and his men, including Wolfstan, are on their way to a remote village at the edge of a large marsh, to investigate stories that it is free of the plague. Ulrich is at the monastery to conscript one of the monks as a guide to lead the soldiers through the marsh to the village. Osmund, having grown up in the area, sees this as the sign he prayed for, as the expedition must pass through the forest where he sent Averill into hiding. He eagerly volunteers to guide the soldiers.Along the way, in the woods, the soldiers pass by a group of villagers preparing to burn alive a woman suspected of witchcraft (Marianne Graffam). Ulrich interferes and unties the woman, leading her away only to cut her throat with a dagger. He tells Osmund that as soon as the soldiers left, the villagers would have promptly seized the woman again and carried on with the execution. The woman was as good as dead when they encountered her, and all Ulrich could hope to do was make her death painless and quick.They are passing through the forest where Averill is in hiding and make camp. At dawn, Osmund hurries to the landmark where Averill told him to meet her. He finds only her scarf and a group of bandits. Osmund makes it back to the camp, but the brigands track him there and attack the soldiers. The soldiers slay most of the brigands, but a few manage to escape -- with the soldiers' horses, forcing them to go the rest of the way on foot.They arrive at the village and are greeted by Hob (Tim McInnerny), who welcomes them when they say are travelers seeking shelter for the night. Osmund, who is wounded, receives treatment from the town herbalist, Langiva (Carice Van Houten). They are all invited to dine with the villagers in the evening. But slowly signs start to come out that things are not as they appear in the quiet, peaceful village. Langiva saw right through Ulrich's story, as she tells Osmund. Seeing a look about him, she trusts him with knowing that she harbors a resentment toward the pious and holy, as they killed her husband. Shortly before dinner, she brings him to a field where a number of scarecrow-like effigies are on stakes -- but Langiva tells Osmund that they are in fact the remains of the last Church party that sought to kill them for perceived heresies and sacrileges. Then she reaches into what appears to be a shallow grave... and pulls out Averill.Ulrich has found an idol that, to him, is proof that the village is without God -- and for that, they must all pay.But it is Ulrich and all the others who about to be betrayed. Their food and drink, at the dinner, was drugged. They all come to at dawn, bound in a deep trough filled to their waists with water. All the village is gathered around, and Langiva is to preside over THEIR trials. The village has become strong in its sense of community and having all renounced God. Now they intend to do the same with the soldiers, all of whom are defiant and ready even to wrestle each other over the 'right' to die first in God's name. The village chooses Frith (Thorsten Querner) to be first. They bind him to a cross, ready to kill him slowly and painfully unless he renounces his faith. But Frith's profession in the Church is a torturer; he inflicts torture on perceived heretics, witches, and those accused of being ungodly. He proves that there is nothing they can teach him about pain, and finally they simply disembowel him. The next soldier chosen, his morale broken, renounces his faith and God before the village, whereon Langiva says that three villagers will escort him to the outskirts and let him go free-- a lie, as he is hanged like a common criminal from the trees just outside the village.Langiva directs Osmund to go into a particular nearby house. She still sees him as a potential convert to the village's independent, atheistic way of life. Osmund finds Averill inside. She is in a deep, deep stupor, barely coherent, but she is alive. Still, to Osmund, it appears very much that her mind is gone; he believes Langiva has used dark witchcraft to make Averill into a zombie. Grieving and desperate to see Averill spared any pain and suffering, he takes a knife and grants her release through death, carrying her body out back to the village square.Langiva, angered by Ulrich's continued defiance, has him bound between two powerful draft horses to be drawn and quartered. Hob, instead of letting Ulrich be torn apart, has the horses pull enough to stretch Ulrich like he is on a rack, torturing him. Ulrich appears to break and begs that Osmund be allowed to administer last rites. As the young monk begins to do so, he removes Ulrich's outer garment.Ulrich's body is covered with large, bleeding sores. He has contracted the bubonic plague, and has now brought it to the village as his instrument of dark justice for its ungodliness. The villagers begin to scatter, spooking the horses, who tear Ulrich apart. The remaining soldiers manage to grab a dropped knife, cut themselves free, and overpower the remaining villagers. Hob is captured alive and most of those who remained are killed. Of the soldiers, only Wolfstan survives.Osmund runs after Langiva and accuses her of killing Averill. Langiva answers that she has no powers, no sorcery; she is merely an extremely skillful herbalist who used some 'parlor' tricks with her mastery of herbs and her ability with verbal persuasion, to give the villagers confidence and independence. She is not a witch, merely a good leader. She insists she did not kill Averill; she had found her alive in the forest and merely kept her drugged as part of the plan to convert Osmund. As she walks away, Osmund begs Langiva to bring Averill back, but she coldly tells him she has no power to do so; she scornfully suggests he pray to God and ask Him instead.Wolfstan places Hob in a restraint device hooked up to the wagon they brought. He is bringing Hob back to the Church to be put on trial as the village necromancer. But, as he explains in a voiceover, he knew that Hob was not guilty of witchcraft or any form of demonic consort. The village remained free of the bubonic plague not through witchcraft or necromancy, but merely by its remoteness from the rest of civilzation. Once Ulrich was found to have brought the plague to the village, any of the villagers who didn't die in battle with the soldiers were quickly wiped out by the illness.Wolfstan brings Osmund safely back to the monastery en route to the Church. Although he prays for Osmund to have a long, peaceful life, a series of voiceovers provided by Wolfstan show that Osmund's life became anything but peaceful. Wolfstan explains that he never saw Osmund again, but heard the terrible stories:Averill's death left Osmund nearly mad with grief. Desire for vengeance on Langiva turned his heart stone cold, and he took up the sword as an inquisitioner for the Church, leading merciless crusades against perceived witches. He saw Langiva's face in every woman who was tortured and killed at his command. He is shown delivering a terrified young woman to a dungeon, where she is brutally tortured; he watches impassively as her toes are crushed with metal pliers, and orders her to be killed when she still does not confess to heresy and witchcraft.Wolfstan's closing voiceover offers a prayer that Osmund somehow found peace in his work, as Osmund is seen presiding over a dark execution where a young woman suspected of witchcraft is dragged in terror from the village fields as she is working there, and burned alive. Fade to black."

As he comes back upstairs, a young boy greets him with a loaded shotgun. James (Jacob Latimore) is scared but keeps the gun pointed at Luke. When Luke calls his bluff, James fires a shot in the wall behind him. Luke and James start talking about the situation. James's mother is a bartender at Sonny's and he's waiting for her to return from the church down the street. Someone came by and told her there was power there and other people. It's been a while and she hasn't returned. He's waiting for the sun to come up to go look for her. Luke says that may never happen. He's noticed that the days are getting shorter and shorter. We then find out that, even though it's pitch black outside, it's actually 11:00 AM. Just then, Rosemary arrives. She is freaking out because she can't find her baby. After she left the hospital, she went home to find her nanny and baby had disappeared like everyone else but she's convinced his father took him.They hear someone yelling outside. After arguing about whether or not they should go, Luke takes a flashlight to investigate. He sees Paul lying on the bench at a bus shelter. It was the first of many solar powered shelters the city was planning on implementing. As Luke gets ready to drag Paul back to Sonny's, his flashlight dies. He decides to go for it, grabs Paul and runs like hell. The shadows get close and almost grab them when Luke falls down and hurts his ankle but Rosemary opens the door to the bar and enough light shines into the street to keep the darkness at bay.Paul (John Leguizamo) says that his light went off, and that he was hit by something. He felt himself being taken someplace when his light came back on and he woke up in the street. He dragged himself to the bus shelter and started calling for help.Over the course of the film, it's revealed that the reason they're still around is because they were still lit when the power first went out. Paul by his headlamp, Rosemary was lighting her cigarette and Luke fell asleep with a dozen or so candles lit around him.They begin to argue about what might have caused this phenomenon and various ideas are tossed around when Paul begins to tell the true story of the lost colony on the island of Roanoke. According to Wikipedia - ""The Roanoke Colony on Roanoke Island in Dare County, present-day North Carolina, United States, was a late 16th-century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement. Colonists thrived for years until one day, a supply ship landed there to find the group of colonists had disappeared without a trace."" Paul says the word ""Croatoan"" had been carved into a tree. This was the name of a native American tribe the colonists had butted heads with during their time on the island. He's insinuating that there may not be a reason as to why this happened or maybe it's because we pissed someone or something off and we're being ""reset"". Paul also states the reason they are still there is simply because they are aware they ""exist"". As the argument heats up, the lights start to flicker so everyone goes to check on the generator. It's failing and they only have a short time left before it goes out. They notice a locked door next to the generator and James says he was told that's where you go when things get bad. They assume it's an old bomb shelter. Suddenly, Paul collapses and they drag him to the pool table and put ice and cold clothes on his head.Since they know the generator is failing, Luke is determined to leave the bar. He reveals that while he was at the news studio, a live transmission came through from a Chicago reporter, (Neal Huff), who says he heard his brother who died eight years ago calling him from the darkness. He says that the people in the shadows can trick you, and advises everybody to trust only the light they are holding. He also tells anyone who can see this to come to Chicago and find him. Luke thinks they should all go to Chicago and he wants to push the truck he found to the bar and use the generator to give it the extra juice it needs to start. Rosemary says that Paul needs to go to the hospital and she doesn't want to leave until she finds her baby. Although James doesn't want to leave without his mom, Luke tells him they'll stop by the church on the way. James agrees and eventually, they convince Rosemary.Luke and Rosemary put some lights around their necks and bodies and go after the truck. Before she leaves Rosemary puts a glow stick necklace around James's neck.Paul is in a lot of pain and asks James turns the juke box back on so he can hear one last song. He does it and then goes to the bathroom to get a cold compress for Paul. The lights go out for a couple of seconds.When they come back on, Paul is still on the pool table but James doesn't respond when he calls for him. He gets up to go look for him and finds the bathroom empty. The door to the basement is open so he goes down there and sees the bomb shelter door is unlocked and open.Outside, Rosemary keeps on reminiscing about her lost daughter. Her flashlight flickers and goes out. She mentions that she just put new batteries in it. Luke says he's noticed that, with the exception of solar powered energy, the electricity that still exists seems to be getting weaker and weaker and requires much more power. She and Luke almost make it to the truck when all of their lights go out. The darkness moves in to take them when the little girl reappears. She shines her flashlight on them and gives them enough time to make it to the truck. Luke tries to go after the girl, but his injured ankle causes him to fall down. Rosemary turns on the lights of a car, which saves them both from the dark. They start to push the truck back to Sonny's but they need more light.Back at the bar, Paul enters the shelter door. He hears James calling to him from the other end and moves towards his voice. He runs down a huge corridor lit by round lights. He reaches the door at the end only to find it opens to a brick wall. He collapses on the floor and watches the lights go off one by one and as the darkness takes him, it's revealed that he's actually still on the pool table upstairs. As soon as Paul disappears, the lights flicker again and it's revealed that James, with his glowing necklace is still in the bathroom. He brings water back for Paul but finds only his clothes.Luke tries to make a torch using a metal rod, cloth and some gas from a nearby vehicle. Rosemary says it will burn too quickly and, while they still have a little light, they should try to find something else to use. They are right by a methadone clinic where Rosemary used to be a patient and she knows they have alcohol there. She finds the alcohol and they fix the torch. Rosemary hears the sound of a crying baby. She drops her last glow stick and takes off. Luke chases after her but it's too late. She's running towards a baby stroller in a circle of bright light. As soon as Rosemary reaches it and realizes the stroller is empty, the lights go off. Her empty clothes fall to the ground while Luke watches helplessly.Luke makes it back to Sonny's with the truck. He and James are able to hook it up to the generator and get it running. They drive a short distance and Luke gets out to move a car out of the way. He tells James to move to the driver's seat and keep his foot on the gas or the truck will stall. While Luke it moving the car, James sees light coming from the church where his mom is supposed to be. Disregarding Luke's instructions, he jumps out of the truck and takes off for the church. Luke barely makes it back to the truck to prevent it from stalling. Inside the church, James sees a circle of candles on the floor, with a lump of clothing in the middle. He calls out for his mother but when he reaches it, no one is there. He hears his mother calling him from the surrounding darkness. James doesn't want to go to her but the candles are blowing out and the shadows are moving in. Luke crashes the car into the church and the headlights push the darkness back once again. He gets out to go to James. With no one holding the gas, the truck dies and the headlights go out. Luke is caught in the middle, trying to run after James and he is taken. James stays with the remaining candles, until they all vanish. repeating over and over ""I am James. I exist"".The sun comes up. James wakes up in the church surrounded by unlit candles. The little girl walks up and tells him her name is Briana and that he is in her bed. She says that the things he saw at the church - which he took for his mother's - are hers. Briana and James leave the church, and they see a horse eating some apples. Both James and Briana leave Detroit on the horse.When night arrives, they have reached the outskirts, and they are on the road out."

The place is a polar research station on an island in the Arctic Ocean, inhabited now only by Sergei and Pavel. One day when Sergei is out angling, Pavel picks up a radio message that he daren't communicate. A polar station on a desolate island in the Arctic Ocean. Sergei, a seasoned meteorologist, and Pavel, a recent college graduate, are spending months in complete isolation on the once strategic research base. Pavel receives an important radio message and is still trying to find the right moment to tell Sergei, when fear, lies and suspicions start poisoning the atmosphere...—Koktebel Film Company Meteorology student Pavel ""Pasha"" Danilov is spending the summer as an intern at an isolated, Soviet-era weather station on a remote Arctic island with only the older, experienced geophysicist Sergei Gulybin for company. Their sole job is to collect the weather and tide statistics every four hours on antiquated equipment, which they do in shifts, and report the readings by radio to the state meteorology center. Pasha is respectful and friendly, but he is afraid of the gruff Sergei, who is condescending to him, as he resents Pasha's temporary stay and is jealous that he knows how to operate their only computer.Sergei takes the boat on an unauthorized fishing trip for a few days, and tells him not to mention this. When the radio operator urgently requests to speak with Sergei, Pasha dutifully makes up excuses why he cannot come on the radio. Eventually Pasha is told to take down a radiogram that Sergei's wife and young son have been ""gravely injured"" in an accident, although it is apparent they've been killed. He is told that a ship is headed to get them and instructed to simply give Sergei the message and then ""leave him alone."" The sad news keeps Pasha awake, but when he does sleep he oversleeps; the data goes unrecorded. Seeing Sergei's boat, he hastily grabs the logbook to fill in fake numbers, and in doing so knocks his radiogram under the desk. When Sergei comes ashore with the trout, he is in a good mood. He tells Pasha a warm story about his wife craving salted trout during her pregnancy. Pasha starts to say something, but Sergei interrupts and teaches him how to properly fillet a fish.Once inside, Sergei quickly figures out that the Pasha made up the numbers in the log and explodes in anger, dragging Pasha inside and berating him. He tells him that the station has been continuously occupied since 1935, and that no matter how bad the conditions got, never had anyone just faked the numbers out of sheer laziness, and that now all their work is worthless. He accuses Pasha of being a ""tourist"" in the Arctic in order to write a pointless essay, ""How I Ended This Summer"" (a play on the clichéd ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation."") Sergei tells him an intimidating story about the time one geophysicist apparently killed the other due to their strained relationship.The frightened Pasha does not tell Sergei about his family and temporarily sabotages the radio. When Sergei leaves to get more trout, Pasha is told that the ship is stuck in ice, but that a helicopter will instead come before the weather worsens. Pasha, carrying a rifle, heads to the lagoon to meet the helicopter, but the pilot cannot see the flares due to the heavy fog and flies away. Pasha then notices a polar bear, which begins to chase him. He runs away but eventually trips and falls down a steep embankment.Pasha wakes up in Sergei's boat. As they disembark, Pasha tries to confess to Sergei that he needs to tell him something but Sergei ignores him. Pasha finally blurts out to Sergei that his family is dead. Sergei turns around and comes toward him, and Pasha, frightened and with an injured leg, falls to the ground. Thinking Sergei is going to attack him, Pasha fires at him but misses. He then gets up and runs away while Sergei picks up his gun and fires at him, and then keeps shooting into the air.Pasha takes up residence in an old abandoned cabin. He wakes up to hear Sergei outside and hides, still afraid. Sergei calls to him and says he wants to talk to him. Sergei, who is carrying his rifle, hears Pasha step on something that makes a large cracking sound. Thinking Pasha fired at him, he fires his own rifle. The terrified Pasha runs away.
Pasha, freezing, huddles by an old isotope beacon to keep warm before realizing he has exposed himself to radiation. He sneaks into the cabin when Sergei is away and tries to contact the main station for help but cannot reach anyone. Starving, he steals Sergei's fish and nearly chokes to death on a fishbone. He screams and curses Sergei. He hangs fish up on the isotope beacon; he later sneaks back into the cabin and replaces Sergei's stash of fish with the contaminated fish.One night Sergei sees the disheveled Pasha looking in the cabin window watching him eat the fish. He signals to Pasha to come inside, and then invites him to sit down and have some fish. He says the Academic made it through the ice after all and will be there in three days. Pasha confesses that the fish has been contaminated. Sergei says nothing, but goes to vomit up the fish he has just eaten. Pasha checks the cupboard and sees Sergei has eaten all of the contaminated fish. Sergei returns and says only that they don't have to tell anyone what has happened.The Academic arrives and Sergei tells Pasha he plans to stay on the island. Pasha threatens to tell what has happened to force Sergei to get medical help. Sergei insists he needs to be there alone and embraces Pasha."

In addition, Sadassa Silvia is a character who claims that Ferris Fremount is actually a communist covert agent, and that her mother recruited him for the Soviet Union after she joins the resistance.As with Valis, the book deals with his highly-personal style of Christianity (or Gnosticism), as well as with the moral repercussions of being an informer for the authorities, and his dislike of the Republican Party, satirizing Nixon's America as a Stalinist or neo-fascist police state. Eventually, Fremount captures and imprisons Dick and Brady after the latter produces and distributes a record that urges subliminal messages of revolt to the Fremount dictatorship. Brady and Silvia are executed, and Dick narrates the concluding pasage about his life in a concentration camp, where ""his"" latest work is penned by a ghost writer and regime-approved hack. Suddenly, he hears other music, with another subliminal message. As Dick hears children singing the tune, he realises that all may not be lost after all."

Although he is strapped financially and his home life is happy, his biggest problem comes in the form of the jealousies of his brother, Marko (Slobodan Beti), a corrupt police officer who envies Milo' family life.Seeking one last big payday to make a clean break from pornography and secure his family's financial future, Milo is intrigued when one of his former co-stars, Lejla (Katarina uti), approaches him with an offer to star in an ""art film"" being directed by Vukmir (Sergej Trifunovi), a well-connected, independently wealthy pornographer who wants to cast Milo for his legendary ability to get and maintain an erection with no visual or physical stimuli. When Vukmir offers Milo a large sum of money to star in the film, Milo reluctantly agrees, ambivalent towards Vukmir's insistence that he must remain ignorant as to the plot of the film until shooting begins. As Milos jogs to get himself back in shape for filming, Marko visits Milos' home. He talks suggestively to Marija in the kitchen while Petar eats ice cream. Marko says that he misses female company, then goes to the bathroom, clearly frustrated, and masturbates into the basin. At the next meeting with Vukmir, Milos passes an older bald headed man with two large security guards, and regards them warily.Milo is picked up the next morning and taken to an orphanage where he is supplied an earpiece by Vukmir's driver, Raa (Miodrag Krmarik). A voice speaks to him from the earpiece, giving him instructions. A film crew follows him around with cameras and puts him in various sexual situations to see how he will react. Milo is fellated by a female in a dark room, while two televisions show independently: a teenage girl eating an ice lolly, and the same girl putting make-up on. After this Milo phones Marko to check into police files on Vukmir. During this conversation Marko is also fellated by a female while watching Milo' home movies, and then one of Milo' previous porn films. Milo is then led into a room and instructed to have sex with a physically abused woman while a young girl dressed like Alice from Alice in Wonderland watches. Milo becomes enraged and refuses to continue, but is grabbed from behind. The adult woman threatens Milo by biting on his erection, forcing him to carry on with the 'scene'.Milo meets with Marko to find out what is in the police files on Vukmir: He has been a psychologist, a children's TV producer, and has worked for state security. Marko's opinion in that Vukmir is a well educated man. Later, Vukmir shows Milo another one of his projects: a film of Raa helping a woman give birth to a baby girl; Raa then proceeds to rape the newborn in what the director calls ""newborn porn"".Milo storms out to his car and drives away. At a road junction, he is approached by Vukmir's doctor, an attractive woman, who begins to seduce him. Milo suddenly wakes up in his bed three days later, bloodied and beaten and with no memory of what has happened. He returns to the set and finds a number of tapes. Viewing them, Milo discovers that over the course of the previous three days, he was fed a mixture of drugs to induce a perpetually aggressive, sexually aroused, and suggestible state. Under the influence of the drugs, and at Vukmir's insistence, Milo brutally beats and rapes a nude woman handcuffed to a bed while Vukmir tells Milo that she deserves it for cheating on her husband, a Serbian war hero. In the climax of this scene, Milo is instructed to beat the woman, and eventually handed a machete with which he chops her head off in order to induce rigor mortis as he continues to have sex with her body. Another tape contains a scene in which Milo is naked and chained to a bed face down. Two men enter the room, one holding a camera. The one without the camera begins sodomizing the unconscious Milo. The final tape depicts Lejla chained and hanging in the middle of the room, all of her teeth having been removed; a masked man enters the room, forces his erect penis down her throat and pinches her nose until she suffocates.Milo follows clues from the tapes he has seen only to remember more horrific details about the three days he cannot remember. Milo was taken into a room and made to sodomize a body hidden under covers. The masked man enters and begins to have sex with another body beside the one Milo is raping. The masked man is revealed to be Milo' brother Marko, and the body he is raping is a drugged Marija. The covers are taken off of the body Milo is raping to reveal his own son, also drugged and bleeding profusely from his rectum. A melee ensues during which Marija regains consciousness and Milo manages to wrest a gun from one of Vukmir's bodyguards. Marija bludgeons Marko to death with a sculpture, while Milo beats Vukmir's head against the concrete floor and manages to shoot all but one of his bodyguards, with one surviving two shots to the chest. As he is dying, Vukmir praises Milo' actions, saying ""that's cinema.""Confronting the final bodyguard, Raa, who was previously the driver throughout the film, Milo knocks off his sunglasses and discovers that Raa is missing an eye. He tries to shoot him but finds out that the gun is empty. Milo jams his erect penis into Raa's empty eye socket, killing him. He then knocks his wife unconscious and takes her and their son home, locking them in the basement before passing out. After remembering everything, Milo contemplates suicide, but his wife stops him with a mutual understanding that he, his wife, and his child, should all commit suicide together. Milo then gathers his family in his bed, embracing, and using a pistol, fires a fatal shot through him, Petar, and Marija. Sometime later, another director enters, who is the bald headed man from earlier at Vukmirs house, accompanied by another porn star and a crew. The director instructs one of the actors to ""start with the little one."""

Alba counters by claiming that she is a lesbian and has never had sex with a man.Alba and Natasha first get undressed and into bed, but Natasha is still very nervous. Alba suggests that they first lay side by side and only casually touch each other's faces. They do so until Alba becomes so relaxed that she falls asleep.

Unthinkable,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914863/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A psychological thriller centered around a black-ops interrogator and an F.B.I. Agent who press a suspect terrorist into divulging the location of three nuclear weapons set to detonate in the U.S. A convert to Islam sends the U.S. government a tape showing him in three nondescript storage rooms, each of which may contain a nuclear bomb set to detonate in less than a week. Helen Brody, an FBI agent in L.A., is tasked with finding the bombs while a CIA ""consultant,"" known as H, interrogates the suspect who has allowed himself to be caught. The suspect, whose wife and children have left him and disappeared, seems to know exactly what the interrogation will entail. Even as H ratchets up the pressure, using torture over Brody's objection, the suspect doesn't crack. Should H do the unthinkable, and will Brody acquiesce? Is any Constitutional principle worth possible loss of life?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> After suspecting Henry Humphries of being a terrorist, FBI Agent Helen Brody and others from the Counter-Terrorism Unit find out that he is connected with CIA, and they must work together with him to interrogate a suspect, Steven Arthur Younger, who has allegedly placed three nuclear bombs in three U.S. cities that will explode on Friday October 21st. After conventional questioning and torture fail, Henry resorts to unconventional means, much to Helen's chagrin. A battered and bloodied Steven states that he will only reveal the locations of these bombs after the President makes a public announcement that there will be no further financial and military support of puppet regimes and dictators in any Islamic nation; and all U.S. forces must withdraw from all Islamic nations. Will the U.S. be willing to change it's centuries-old 'Foreign Policy' in order to save the lives of millions of its' citizens or will Henry have to do the unthinkable in order to get this suspect to reveal the exact location of these bombs?—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) An FBI counter-terrorism team and a black-ops agent are assigned to interrogate an American Muslim man named Yusuf (Sheen), formerly named Younger, who claims to have nuclear bombs planted in three U.S. cities[2] that will go off if his (at first, unstated) demands are not met.Using extreme torture as a method of interrogation, ""H"" (Samuel L. Jackson) attempts to force Yusuf to reveal the locations of the nuclear bombs. Also involved is Special Agent Helen Brody of the FBI (Moss) who, at the same time, is leading a team trying to locate the bombs using other information. Once H is authorized to interrogate Yusuf, he quickly shows his capability and cruelty by chopping off one of Yusuf's fingers with a small hatchet. Horrified, Special Agent Brody attempts to put a stop to the measures. Her superiors make it clear that the potentially disastrous consequences necessitate these extreme measures. As the plot unfolds, H escalates his methods (with Brody as the ""good cop"") and Yusuf, trained in resisting torture, maintains his silence.When Brody accuses Yusuf of faking the bomb threat in order to make a point about the moral character of the United States government, he breaks down and agrees that it was all a ruse. He gives her an address to prove it, but visiting the address triggers a C-4 explosion at a nearby shopping mall, killing 53 people. Angry at the senseless deaths, Brody takes a scalpel and begins cutting Yusuf's chest. It is clear, though, that Yusuf is not afraid. He justifies the deaths by comparing them to the greater number of Muslim deaths by American hands. Yusuf then makes his demands: he would like the President of the United States to announce a cessation of support for puppet governments and dictatorships in Middle Eastern countries and a withdrawal of American troops from the Middle East. The group immediately dismisses the possibility of his demands being met, citing the United States' declared policy of not negotiating with terrorists.H falters in his belief that the bombs' location will be revealed until the life of Yusuf's wife is threatened in front of him. Brody attempts to persuade her to cooperate, and she refuses. H. brings her in front of her husband and threatens to mutilate her in front of him. Brody and the others refuse to assent to her torture and start to remove her from the room. In desperation, H slashes her throat and she bleeds to death in front of Yusuf. Yusef still refuses to cooperate, and H tells the soldiers to bring in Yusuf's two children, a young boy and a girl. Outside of Yusuf's hearing, he assures everyone that he will not harm the children. H brings Yusef's children in front of him and prepares to torture the children. Brody demands that Yusef reveal the locations of the bombs. Yusuf finally breaks and gives three addresses in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. H does not stop his preparations to torture the boy and girl and the others forcibly intervene and remove the children. H reminds the team of the amount of missing nuclear material Yusuf may have had at his disposal--some 15-18lbs were reported missing, with about 4-1/2lbs needed per nuclear weapon. H insists that Yusuf has not admitted anything about the existence of a fourth bomb. H insists that Yusef planned for the eventuality that he would finally capitulate to torture or coercion and reveal the three bombs' locations, and believes Yusef placed the fourth bomb for just such a contingency. When Brody refuses to retrieve the children for H, H unstraps Yusuf, saying Yusef has won. Yusef suddenly grabs one of the agent's revolver and kills himself. Brody walks out of the building with Yusuf's children. (This is the end of the original Direct-to-DVD version.)In the extended version:An FBI bomb disposal team arrives at one of the disclosed locations and resets the timer to prevent the bomb from going off. As the FBI are celebrating, the unknown fourth bomb is revealed behind a nearby crate as its timer counts down to zero. The screen cuts to black and the credits roll."
Birdemic: Shock and Terror,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A horde of mutated birds descends upon the quiet town of Half Moon Bay, California. As the death toll rises, two citizens manage to fight back, but will they survive Birdemic? In the town of Half Moon Bay, California, an epidemic is on the horizon: a Birdemic. All the birds are attacking humanity for the devastating damage that they are inflicting on the earth: they're going after gas stations and people's cars, and the birds have something the humans will never see coming: Bird-Acid.—Johnny BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR does, indeed, contain copious amounts of both shock and terror. The shock and terror, however, are the audience's: unbelievable shock at the horrific acting, direction, special effects, screenplay, script, and cinematography, and indescribable terror at the the thought of ever having to watch such an atrocity again. Directed and written by James Nguyen, BIREDEMIC stars Alan Bagh as Rod, the laughably inept hero (??), and Whitney Moore as Rod's love interest, Nathalie. At one point, we get to see Nathalie (who, despite being a Victoria's Secret model, is still strongly encouraged to pursue a real estate career by her mother, in case modeling ""doesn't work out"") in a thong and bra; this, I suspect, is the sole motivation for the making of this movie.After more than forty-five minutes of establishing shots, watching Rod slowly drive from place to place, finding out that Rod's best friend is dating Nathalie's best friend (what a coincidence!), and suffering through Rod and Nathalie's first date, in which they describe themselves as though on job interviews in robotic, flat voices, we are finally introduced to the reason for the movie's title. Rod (a recent millionaire) and Nathalie (did I mention she's a Victoria's Secret model?) are inexplicably staying at a cheap no-tell motel when they are confronted by large, vicious birds (eagles), and the viewer is confronted by the worst special effects in the entire history of movie making. Rod, Nathalie, and two other motel patrons, Ramsey (Adam Sessa) and Becky (Catherine Batcha), manage to make it into Ramsey's minivan using coat hangers to defend themselves against the large eagles that brashly toss aside all laws of physics and hover in the air. The group drives off, shooting at the birds with the various AK-47's and handguns that Ramsey apparently keeps in his van at all times.After stumbling across a few cars containing drivers who were killed by the birds and rescuing a boy and girl, both around age ten, the group stops at a gas station to buy food for the children (the children, it seems, have time to meditate on their hunger despite the fact that they saw their parents viciously attacked by killer eagles less than two hours ago). The station's patron has also been killed by the birds, but, puzzlingly, the birds have not effected the rest of the area's population, as evidenced by the dozens and dozens of cars whizzing by, driven by people oblivious to the fact that nature is on the attack.While stopped for a picnic (the danger of being outside where they are most vulnerable to the killer birds dawns on nobody), our troupe is informed by an old man that the bird attacks are the result of global warming. Afterwards, while ""taking a shit"" (a direct quote from Ramsey), Catherine is attacked and killed, which is made all the more tragic due to the fact that the group is forced to leave their roll of toilet paper behind as, terror-stricken, they merge carefully onto the road and drive away at a safe, moderate speed.Later, the gang comes across tourists trapped by the killer birds on a tour bus. Spraying their guns indiscriminately, the group manages to hit the birds but not the tourists, but have little time to celebrate this victory as several of the birds spontaneously combust, spewing what is evidently acidic blood and/or innards on the hapless tourists and Ramsey. Stopping for gas soon after, Rod is informed that gas is now $100/gallon due to the birds, whose influence clearly extends to such a degree that OPEC and the entire global economy are suffering. Rod, Nathalie, and the children are attacked again, but manage to escape using their guns which are, luckily, never emptied of bullets.After an brief encounter with a man who tries to steal their reserve gas but is conveniently killed by a bird while doing so, the group stops at a small forest where they meet a man, known only as ""Tree Hugger"" to the audience (Stephen Gustavson). ""Tree Hugger,"" who bears a strong resemblance to Woody Harrelson in a wig, informs Rod and co. that nature is not attacking humans; rather, humans are attacking nature. Perhaps this is why, shortly later, dozens of unexplained forest fires break out all around the group, forcing them to flee once again.Continuing on with their trip to nowhere on a day which is evidently over a hundred hours long, the four stop at the beach where Rod and Nathalie try unsuccessfully to get the children to eat fish and seaweed, and where, of course, they are yet again attacked by the birds. This time, though, while cowering in the van, the group is rescued by a flock of doves, which manages to scare the eagles away. The group emerges from the van and walks to the shore, where they stand staring at the two flocks of birds flying in place--er, that is, off into the distance--over the ocean. And thus, the tragedy that is BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR mercifully ends."

While Jo (Roberts) is chained down in a dead end supermarket job, her friends are all out on their own separate adventures: Cassandra (Egerton) is jetting off to New York to meet her Internet boyfriend; Kerrys (Warren-Markland) is on a one woman crusade fighting for female liberation and Shannon (Lovibond) is on a one way trip to meet her maker. But a chance encounter with some diamond thieves sends their separate worlds on a collision course with not only each other, but fate itself. These 4 girls are about to have 3 days they will never forget, spanning to 2 cities. That is ... if they survive.—The Works The story focuses mainly upon 4 friends, Jo (Emma Roberts), Shannon (Ophelia Lovibond), Kerrys (Shanika-Warren Markland) and Cassandra (Tamsin Egerton). They all meet one other at a Diner, where they also see Dillon (Adam Deacon) and Smoothy (Bashy) getting chased by the police while drug-dealing. As Dillon is running past, he drops a stolen diamond (out of 15) in Cassandra's bag. He is unaware that Shannon has a big crush on Dillon as he always ignores her. The four then walk out and go home.Firstly, the story focuses upon Shannon: as she walks into her home, she sees that her mother has left for good and her dad is sitting in the living room all alone. She loses her temper, gets a packet of ""Pringles"", two cans of spray-paint and runs away. She then runs over to Joanne's home, who has to rush to work, telling her she does not have time to talk. Later on, she is called over to Jo's work place by Jo; where she is told to leave. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo upsetting Shannon, so she grabs a Pringles box from the shop and runs. She is taken in by a woman who saved her from getting raped, but Shannon seems to find that the woman is looking for the Pringles box. This is later confirmed when she finds out that she is searching for ""15 diamonds"". One is already in Cassandra's bag, whilst the rest are in the Pringles can which had fallen out of Shannon's bag earlier. She escapes by knocking the woman out with the bathroom door. She finds the diamonds by going back to the bench where she was almost attacked. Her story ends with her holding the diamonds above a bridge, suggesting she is about to jump and commit suicide.Secondly, the story moves onto Cassandra, who visits New York to meet up with a man called ""Brett"" she has met on the internet. The meeting ends with her having sex with him. She suddenly feels light headed and falls asleep, and in the morning uses an epipen to pull herself together. She discovers all her possessions gone except for her handbag containing a diamond. She also finds the letter that Shannon has been looking for, which was written by her mother. She later goes to ""Brett's"" house to later find that ""Brett"" is a stalker who hacks into Cassandra's computer taking videos of her. When the fake Brett comes, she knocks him out but later escapes chasing her down the street where she is rescued by a black woman who does not take kindly to racist stereotypical views. She gets her cousins to beat and tattoo the fake Brett with the words chosen by Cassandra. She forces her way into an audition for a new tutor and gets it before then leaving for London.Thirdly the story of Kerrys is explored. Kerrys and her girlfriend break into Cassandra's beachhouse and stay there. Her brother upon discovering them inside, locks them in the panic room and throws a party. While, Dillon and Smoothy visit his house, they ask him to keep the diamonds (now only 14 left) at his house. When the two girls escape from the panic room, they lock her brother in there and run away.Fourthly, Jo, who works at a 24-hour supermarket with Angelo (Jacob Anderson) finds that her new manager (""Tee"" Noel Clarke) is in town. Tee has been working with Dillon and Smoothy to deliver the diamonds, but one is missing. Tee asks Dillon and Smoothy to come over to the supermarket; Dillon and Smoothy open the safe with the key (which Tee had given to them earlier), they remove the money and drop off the diamonds (which are 14, but Tee thinks there is 15). Dillon and Smoothy come to get the money, when they find Tee has betrayed them, and they rob the store and leave Tee with the 14 diamonds. Tee, however has hidden them in a Pringles box, which is then seen in flashback to show that the box is the very same one that Shannon has. Whilst Tee is about to be shot by the same woman who rescued Shannon earlier, Jo rescues him, but when he tries to run, Angelo attacks him. He is arrested by the police for illegal selling.Cassandra returns with the last diamond and the letter; the three (Cassandra, Jo, and Kerrys) then go to meet Shannon. They put the 14 diamonds together and give it into the police and fly to New York. Whilst on the plane it is revealed that the same mysterious woman who had rescued Shannon is on the plane."

Elena Undone,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1575539/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Fate brings two diversely different women together, and sets them on a collision course that will shatter their preconceived notions about love, life and the power of one's soul. Peyton and Elena are, on the surface, diametrically opposed - one, a well-known lesbian writer, the other a mother and wife of a pastor - but when their paths cross, several times over, they feel compelled to connect. What begins as friendship quickly blossoms into something deeper. Peyton tries to extricate herself before her heart wants what it can't have. Elena can't imagine not having Peyton in her life. And despite the fact that she has never even considered kissing a woman, Elena is overwhelmed with a desire to do just that. Despite Peyton's reservations, Elena pushes the relationship into a full-blown affair. The two women fall deeply in love, both keenly aware a future together might be little more than a dream.—Jane Clark Before crossing paths with Peyton, falling for a woman was unimaginable for Elena (Necar Zadegan), a straight wife and mother. The friendship between Peyton, an out lesbian writer (Traci Dinwiddie), and Elena, the wife of an anti-gay pastor transforms swiftly from a one-sided crush into a torrid extramarital affair. Despite their attraction, Peyton, jaded in a number of ways, has strong reservations about becoming involved with a married straight woman; Elena, recognizing that she is caught in a love-less marriage, can barely begin to rationalize the nature and magnitude of her desires. As their relationship evolves, Elena confronts the choice of leaving Barry (Gary Weeks), her husband, or ending her involvement with Peyton to save her already unraveling marriage. Above all, Elena faces the looming challenge of convincing Peyton that the two women have a bright future together despite their unfavorable circumstances. In the opening scene, the paths of two women cross. They are Elena Winters (Necar Zadegan), a mother and pastor's wife, and Peyton Lombard (Traci Dinwiddie), a well-known lesbian writer. They are both in their late 30s and while they are walking down a park pathway, both make eye contact with each other before walking their separate ways.The movie opens in two places - following the two protagonists - first, within a church, where Elena's teenage stepson, Nash, refuses to support an anti-homosexual protest, and then within a funeral service for Peyton's recently deceased mother.Elena and her husband Barry (Gary Weeks) are trying to conceive but it becomes clear that their efforts have been unsucessfull when Barry rebukes Elena after her period starts. Meanwhile, Peyton starts cleaning out her mother's things from her house, having flashbacks of her emotionally troubled mother as she works. Peyton finds a tape entitled 'Women's Glory Project' with her things, and becomes obsessed with it.Elena visits her friend Tyler for advice, telling him that she and Barry are going to adopt instead of trying to have another child. He asks ""what's in it for her,"" and insists (as he's apparently done in the past) that Barry is not her soul mate, or ""twin flame."" Even so, he pushes her to go to the adoption, saying that ""someone is definitely coming into her life, in a big way.""Peyton and Elena meet once again at the adoption agency. They briefly speak as Peyton returns Elena's lost keys to her. They exchange business cards after Peyton mentions that she might have use for a photographer (which Elena was prior to marrying Barry).Peyton's lesbian best friend, Wave (Mary Wells), drags her to a 'love guru' (who happens to be Tyler) where Peyton and Elena meet again. Elena finds out that Peyton is gay as they talk about their marriages. Peyton calls Elena the next day, inquiring if Elena would help her with continuing her mother's Women's Glory Project, and make plans for Elena to visit the next day with her portfolio.They meet once again, and it's revealed that Peyton's an agoraphobic with substantial difficulties trusting. They bond over the next few weeks - over picnics with Tyler, and late-night glasses of wine. Later, Elena takes better professional photographs of Peyton for her books, and they discuss their upbringings and how they knew they were straight and gay, respectively.One day, Peyton calls Wave asking for advice on her feelings for Elena, and her friend tells her to be honest with Elena about said feelings, unaware that Elena has some of her own. She visits Peyton later, after being avoided for some time, showing up at her door with the printed photographs. At the unexpected visit, Peyton discloses her feelings to Elena and suggests that they not spend time together. Elena violently rebukes that idea, telling Peyton that she's her absolute best friend, that they need to be in each others lives, and that Peyton can have ""all of her except for that (meaning physically romantic encounters)."" Subsequently, however, Elena begins to rapidly examine her own feelings. Elena calls Peyton after exploring lesbian websites, saying that she's not attracted to them and doesn't think she's a lesbian (leaving the viewer aware that she is attracted to Peyton). This is followed by an uncharacteristically (up to this point) passionate statement from Elena asking if she and Peyton could agree to call her feeling a serious ""crush."" Her husband walks up in the middle of the call, causing her to quickly end it, which appears even more suspicious.The following day, Elena comes over to Peyton's house and makes out with her passionately (in a long, three-minute unbroken shot) before leaving. As time passes, Elena begins wanting more from her relationship with Peyton. Another day or two later, while over at Peyton's house to look over more of the photo shots that she took, she suddenly asks Peyton to make love with her. At first Peyton refuses, saying that ""once they go there, there's no going back."" Elena tells her that she doesn't want to go back. As they're having sex, Peyton asks Elena to stay with her, though it's unclear whether she means physically or emotionally.The next day, both Elena and Peyton happily confide in Tyler and Wave about their newfound sexual tryst with each other. Tyler is happy and supportive to Elena, while Wave disapproves to Peyton, reminding her that Elena is married and straight. Peyton yet is happy in her new romance with Elena and doesn't want it to end.One morning after another night of lovemaking between them, Elena and Peyton get into a bit of an inquisition when Peyton asks how Barry comes on to Elena and when and how often they have sex. Elena tells her that they don't have sex anymore, and also tells her that they're going on an annual vacation to Hawaii together. Peyton writes intimate letters to Elena as she's away, and Nash is the one that finds them as he's looking for some aspirin in her suitcase.The toll of having two partners starts to eat away at Elena, and she begins to get in more fights with both Barry and Peyton. Nash starts stealing and drinking from the stress of keeping Elena's affair with Peyton secret, and ends up getting caught by the police after getting drunk and returning to the store he stole from. When Elena comes back and confronts him about it, he tells her that he knows of her affair with Peyton and she explains (briefly) that she does not intend to stop seeing her.Elena returns to Tyler out of desperation for answers as to why she's been set on this path, and meets Peyton later and kisses her in the park, oblivious to Millie seeing them together. Millie then calls Barry and tells him about Elena's affair. Peyton tells her that they should probably break up, because of all the complications arising for Elena. Elena insists that they don't, asking Peyton rhetorically if she ever saw a future of them together. They break up and Elena walks off as Millie goes to Barry and tells him about the affair to his face. Elena breaks up with Barry, telling him that Nash needs the real them, not the fighting couple that they've become.Six months later.Wave and Peyton are taking a walk in the park and run into Tori and Nash, also doing the same. Elena also comes up, walking with Tyler and his wife. She's now pregnant, and at first Peyton freaks out, thinking that Elena played her and was sleeping with Barry the entire time they were together. Elena faints, and Nash gets Peyton and Elena to talk together at Tyler's house so Elena can explain that she broke up and is getting divorced from Barry, but still wanted a child, to have some hope in her life and that she received IVF with Tyler's 'contribution,' and asks Peyton to try and understand. Peyton apologizes to Elena and they kiss.The final scene shows another of Tyler's picnics with Peyton and Elena together with their infant."

They find themselves chained together, with the five outcasts all masked and wearing costumes inspired by horror movies (Killer Klowns from Outer Space, The Strangers, My Bloody Valentine, The Mummy, etc). They want revenge for the years of torment and want to torture their worst enemies.A vulgar teenager, named Miles, decides that the entire thing is a stupid Halloween joke and starts to mouth off.

Emily then offers Bradley safety if he agrees to cut off Bridget's fingers. Bradley cuts off two fingers on Bridget's right hand before Emily offers the deal to Bridget again.

Remembering meeting two of the kids earlier the previous day and seeing them set up bear traps in the grass, decides to investigate, leaving the tied up Kurtis behind. Parker goes to investigate, but is caught in a trap, severely injuring his legs.

Bradley, now breaking down into a sobbering coward, attempts to apologize, though this bears no fruit. Dane then uses his switchblade to sever Bradley's spinal cord, instantly paralyzing him from the neck down.Back at Parker's house, Kurtis manages to untie himself and calls the police from Parker's house phone to report what is going on. Kurtis then returns to Dane's house, where he saves a boy, named Riggs, from getting his tongue cut off.

After one last hug, and Emily speaking her final words to Kelly. Jack then shoots and kills Emily, just as the police arrive. The police burst through, demanding that Jack drop the gun, but he only points it to his own head, declaring that they are ""too late"" and that ""there are more of us out there"" before pulling the trigger, killing himself.A news report recounts how the popular kids were abducted and tortured ""without reason"". Kelly, who remained unharmed, swallows a large amount of pills in the school's restroom. At school, Kurtis exchanges looks with the remaining triplet.

Confessions,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1590089/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A psychological thriller of a grieving mother turned cold-blooded avenger with a twisty master plan to pay back those who were responsible for her daughter's death. Junior high school teacher Yuko Moriguchi (Takako Matsu) announced to her class that she would resign before spring break. Moriguchi revealed that because the HIV-positive biological father of her daughter Manami was ill, she used to bring Manami (Mana Ashida) to school with her. One day, after school, she returned to the room where Manami was but found her gone. Her daughter was later found drowned in a school swimming pool. She then went on to explain that two pupils in her class, whom she dubbed ""Student A"" and ""Student B"", had murdered her four-year-old daughter.She found a small bunny purse amongst Manami's belongings which should not have belonged there, which led her to question Shuya, one of her students, who immediately admitted killing Manami, and mocked her compassionate reaction to his feinted expression of remorse of ""just kidding"".Having revealed their identities, she explained that, because they, as minors, are protected by the Juvenile Law of 1947, turning them in wouldn't make a difference. So to inact revenge on them, she admits injecting her late daughter's biological father's HIV-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students who she claimed to have murdered her daughter. The rest of the film switches between the aftermath of Moriguchi's confession and the events before the confession through a series of first-person narratives from Moriguchi and her three students. Naoki Shimomura (Kaoru Fujiwara), Student B, became a shut-in because he believes he had acquired AIDS from drinking HIV-contaminated milk. His mother (Yoshino Kimura), after spotting the hidden malicious messages in well-wishes cards from Naoki's classmates, realized her son was somehow involved with an earlier incident. She decided to commit murder-suicide to free her son and herself from torment, but in the ensuing struggle, Naoki kills her. The police arrested him for the murder. Shuya Watanabe (Yukito Nishii), Student A, explained that his mother abused him before leaving to pursue her scientific ambitions. He confessed that her abandonment had driven him to thrive in Science, from making small inventions to recording his killing and dissecting animals. His first public invention, an electric anti-mugger wallet, earned him a science fair award, but it failed to make the headlines, as the media was busy covering ""Lunacy Incident"".Shuya and Naoki's recollections revealed that Shuya said he had upgraded the anti-mugger wallet, and decided to try it out on someone, and roped Naoki in to help with his plan. They decided on Moriguchi's daughter Manami.

Neds,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560970/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Encompassed by violent street gangs, neglectful parents, bullying teachers and a dearth of positive role models, a studious but emotionally abandoned kid turns thug. Despite having a drunken, abusive father and a brother who leads a local gang John McGill is a studious boy for whom a bright educational future beckons. As he grows into his teenage years, the challenges of youth mixed with the challenges of being brought up in a tribal and violent place right at the low end of the class spectrum take their toll. John is a fighter, which although isn't what his Mother, at least, wishes for him; may it prove to be what brings him salvation?—don @ minifie-1 Peter Mullan's third feature as a writer and director, after Orphans and The Magdalene Sisters, returns him to the 1970s Glasgow of his youth, although the Trainspotting and My Name is Joe actor stresses that Neds (which stands for 'Non-Educated Delinquents') is 'personal but not autobiographical'.We meet confident, studious John McGill just as he's about to start secondary school, where he fully expects to continue his so-far glittering academic career. But there are dark clouds on the horizon. His friendship with middle-class Julian shines a light on both his poor background and the dysfunction of his home, where his father is drunk, violent and ineffective, his mother is troubled and repressed and his elder brother is always in trouble with the law. At school, there are one or two good teachers, but most are uninterested and unhelpful in the face of the brutal and territorial gang culture which has spread from local housing estates to the schoolyard.The uneasy question Mullan poses is whether or not John can transcend the destiny of his class, education and family to make something of himself. Mullan shoots this tense, claustrophobic and violent drama in a style that tips a hat to the 1970s tales of Ken Loach and Alan Clarke. But it's not all desaturated realism: there are flashes of fantasy that hint at the imagination of Lindsay Anderson, as if Mullan had reimagined If... for the hard-up Glasgow of his youth."

Marcus disagrees and insist that they leave. But Carmen manages to convince Marcus to return. They leave their car and walk into the forest where they eventually find the area with the fog. Marcus takes pictures of the fog.

Carmen and Marcus wait for Sara to return but after awhile, they lose their patience. Marcus insist that they leave but they can't leave Sara behind. Carmen enters the fog to find Sara. Moments after she enters the fog, Sara somehow gets out and is found by Marcus. Sara appears to be a little scared and unfocused. Carmen seems to have gotten lose in the fog and comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. Carmen takes a picture of it.

This frightens Carmen. As she backs away from the statue, she find herself out of the fog and is found by Marcus and Sara. Sara and Carmen talk about seeing the statue, both a bit disoriented, also having heard strange whispering voices.As they make their way back to their car, they come arcoss Lidia who claims to know the whereabouts of Eric and takes them to a hidden sacrificial tomb, where they discover the bodies of people (including Eric) whom the village people have executed. Each body has a metal mask deeply embedded on its face, making it look as though the villagers are cultists and are practicing some kind of ritual black magic on the tourists who come to Alvania. Marcus, Sara and Carmen notice that Lidia is gone and finds the door to the tomb jammed.Luckily, Marcus is able to open it but they are suddenly surrounded by the villagers. They struggle to escape but one of the villagers knocks out Carmen. Henryk shoots Sara's leg with a crossbow.

Sara and Carmen are taken inside the sacrificial tomb while Marcus is led away by two villagers and is forced to dig a grave at gunpoint. After one of them leaves, Marcus uses the shovel to disarm the remaining villager with the gun and knock him unconscious. He takes the gun and runs off to rescue Sara and Carmen.At the sacrificial tomb, Cultists strip Carmen and Sara and don them with ceremonial gowns. Henryk puts on the Cultists' robes. The Cultists place Sara on the same ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The Cultists secure her arms, legs and head. They then deeply lacerate her arms and sever her Achilles' tendons. While this is being done to her, she sees the faces of the Cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask they found on the corpses is placed over Sara's head. It has two spikes inside of it which are meant to pierce Sara's eyes and embed the mask on her face. Arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask on Sara, executing her in the process.One of the Cultists looks at Carmen and she sees that the Cultist's face become that of a demon as well. They bring her out to be sacrificed but Marcus rescues her. He locks the Cultists in the tomb and he and Carmen make their escape.They enter a villager's house to steal the keys to a truck. Marcus sees a woman, Emilia, and her son, Dariusz, in the kitchen. The woman calls for her husband, Aleks, but is unable to do anything since Marcus still has the gun. Marcus asks them for the keys to the truck but they can't understand English. When they see Carmen, Emilia expresses fear and panic. Marcus takes the family to their living room and ties up the couple.While Marcus tries to get them to give him the keys, Carmen starts to experience voices. She sees the objects in the room shake. She sees Daruisz turn into a demon and gaze at her. She sees Emilia and Aleks untie themselves and crawl on the floor and as demons. Marcus turns around to Carmen and he too becomes a demon. But in truth, all of them are still humanEmilia and Aleks are still tied up and none of them are even looking at her.Carmen goes to another room where she continues to see and hear things. Dariusz, who understands and speaks English, leads Marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. Not wanting to risk Dariusz going out and call for help, Marcus also ties him up. The boy begs for Marcus to let them go and warns him that Carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. However, Marcus ignores him. Carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room and lets out a very loud shriek. The Cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for Carmen, hear the shriek and are alerted of Carmen's location.Marcus hears Carmen calling out to him. He enters the room she went inside through a door from the kitchen. As he enters the room, another door leading back to the living room closes. Marcus hears Aleks and Emilia scream in fear and pain, followed by footsteps going to the kitchen. Marcus then hears Dariusz screaming. As he looks out from the door, he sees the boy being dragged on the floor. The door then closed before he could go out and Dariusz's screaming stops. The door leading to the living room slowly opens. He goes to the living room and finds the entire family brutally killed. A possessed Carmen then jumps on him and pins him on the floor. Just as she is about to kill Marcus, she is confronted by the Cultists. She kills several of them. Arkadiusz fights back with prayers and holy water. He calls for the mask but the Cultist holding the mask is stunned in fear, giving the possessed Carmen the opportunity to impale Arkadiusz. Carmen turns her attention back to Marcus.Before Arkadiusz dies, he passes on his duties to Henryk. Henryk chants prayers while splashing Carmen with holy water. Henryk stabs Carmen. The prayers weaken her, allowing Henryk to slowly set on her on the floor. Two more Cultists help. They impale Carmen's hands and pin her to the floor, making sure she does not get back up. Henryk calls for the mask and this time, the Cultist holding the mask complies. They position the mask over Carmen's face while Henryk readies the sledgehammer. However Carmen stills struggles and the mask can't be properly placed over her eyes.Marcus now realizes what is going on and understands why it was necessary to kill Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen saw the statue which is why the villagers decided to kill them but not Marcus. The Cultists weren't Cultists and they weren't sacrificing anyone. They were trying to prevent demonic possessions from taking place. Knowing this, Marcus helps out Henryk and the others. He holds Carmen's head still. With the mask now in place, Henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. Carmen returns to normal and asks Marcus for help but Marcus knows it is just a trick. Henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on Carmen, killing her.Marcus then looks at Henryk and the remaining men, wondering what will happen to him since he knows too much. One of the villagers asks Henryk on what they will do with Marcus. In the end, Marcus is set free by the villagers. Henryk offers to have one of the village's men take him to where he needs to go. Marcus looks over to the forest where the fog is seen. Not really knowing what is really inside the fog, he asks Henryk about it. He is told that the fog and the statue are a curse left long ago to the village that cannot be undone. The devillish statue is shown once more and the screen goes black."

The vampires Louise, Charlotte and Nora arrive in Berlin after attacking the passengers and crew of an airplane in a flight to Paris. The leader Louise has been looking for centuries for her missed love and Charlotte misses her daughter that she saw in 1923 for the last time. Meanwhile, the smalltime pickpocket Lena steals a Russian mobster and is chased by Detective Tom. When Lena goes to a nightclub, the lesbian Louise believes that Lena is the love of her life and transforms her into a vampire. Lena initially feels lost with the transformation, but sooner she joins the trio of vampires in their nightlife. When the pack of vampires attacks a group of criminals, the police department investigates the case and hunts the women without knowing the risks that they are taking. Meanwhile the lonely Tom and the Lena fall in love with each other; but the unrequited love of Louise for Lena jeopardizes the couple.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 18-year old Lena lives an unhappy life in Berlin with an uncaring mother and problems to fit in, constantly shoplifting and stealing. One night while visiting a nightclub, Lena is spotted by the vampire Louise. Lena is turned by Louise and introduced to a new life of wealth, fast cars and parties with Louise and her two fellow vampires Charlotte and Nora. Meanwhile, the young and sympathetic police officer Tom is investigating Lena. While Tom hopes to help Lena, he is unwittingly heading for a crash collision with Louise.—The Man in the Leathermask The film opens with several images of three young women. The images date further and further back until ending in the late 18th century.In a private airplane, the people and the pilots are dead. The only survivors, three young women, are the obvious killers. The leader of these women finds an air-hostess (Cristina do Rego) still alive. After examining her eyes, she breaks her neck and the women jump out of the plane, allowing it to crash into Berlin, Germany.The next day, somewhere in Berlin, a young 18-year-old drug addict and petty criminal, Lena (Karoline Herfurth), lurks near an ATM cash dispenser. Just as her victim has used the machine she pickpockets his credit card only for the victim to be arrested by the police. A police officer, Tom (Max Riemelt), chases after her and eventually catches up with her on a bridge. After a short conversation, he tries to arrest her but Lena hits him in the face, kicks him between the legs and jumps off the bridge onto a passing boat. Lena returns to her home, a large high-rise apartment block where she lives with her drug-addicted, alcoholic mother (Steffi Kühnert) who is flirting with her parole officer.Later that evening, Lena goes to a nightclub. Everyone in line for the club is being examined with a hidden camera by one of the women from the beginning, Louise (Nina Hoss). Upon seeing Lena, she orders the guard to let her in. Inside the club, Louise dances with Lena and offers her a drink. She asks where Lena's friends are, but Lena replies she does not have any. When Lena goes to the bathroom, Louise follows and bites her on her neck. Freaked out and seeing that Louise casts no reflection in the mirror, the terrified Lena runs home. When she awakes in the morning, the sun burns her, forcing her to stay inside. That night, Lena returns to the club to confront Louise about what has happened. She meets Louise's two companions, the silent brunette Charlotte (Jennifer Ulrich) and the cheerful redhead Nora (Anna Fischer). Although the word is never said in the film, it becomes clear that Louise, Charlotte and Nora are vampires.The girls sell the angry and confused Lena to a Russian pimp (Waléra Kanischtscheff) as a prostitute. Louise plans for Lena to kill the wicked man to ease her transformation. Lena is locked in a room. When the pimp comes in to rape her, she is overwhelmed by vampiric blood lust and attacks the pimp. In the struggle, she stabs him with a broken light bulb and tries to escape but another pimp shoots her with a shotgun. The three other vampire girls return to kill the pimps before setting them ablaze. They fail to notice one mobster hiding in fear. Before leaving, Nora steals one of the mobster's Lamborghini.When Lena awakes at the hotel, Louise gives her a glass of what appears to be blood. As Lena drinks, she feels her strength return. Louise takes care of Lena, removing her dirty and torn clothes and showing her to a bathroom where a bath is waiting. Louise tells Lena the story of how she was changed 280 years ago at a masked ball. At first she hated her maker (a woman), but grew to love her after traveling throughout Europe and getting to know all the benefits of vampire life. After her maker was burned (killed by sunlight), Louise wanted to commit suicide to join her, but instead began searching for a new companion. Louise then settled with and turned Charlotte and Nora as her two new companions/lovers. Louise then walks out and closes the bathroom door at Lena's request for privacy. As Lena bathes, her short hair grows and returns to its natural color, her ear and nose piercings fall out and she loses all scars, bruises and wounds (including a tattoo on her belly).Now fully embracing her new life as a vampire (mostly due to finally leaving her life of poverty behind her), Lena spends the night shopping, partying and having fun with her three new vampire girlfriends who give her the stolen Lamborghini as a gift. As they party, Lena notices that Charlotte longingly staring at a pair of baby shoes. Charlotte also exhibits several signs of depression and engages in acts of self-harm, among other things burning her own eyeball (which immediately heals).During a dinner at a local restaurant, (the vampires can eat and taste food, but it does not satisfy them), Louise tells Lena that there are no male vampires currently in existence, because as the male vampires grew arrogant, the females grew tired of their superiority and killed all of them with the common promise to never turn a man into a vampire. Nora also reveals to Lena that she first met Louise at a Gay Pride Love Parade of 1997 where, after a one-night stand, Louise bit and turned her.As the night comes to an end, the four lady vampires return to their hotel to perform their morning ritual: allowing the first rays of sun burn their skin but retreating inside before any lasting harm can be done. Charlotte stays outside longer than the others, but retreats before catching fire. As they settle into their individual coffins for the day, Louise deeply and passionately kisses Lena, which startles and confuses Lena who bites Louise's lip in response. Louise interrupts herself and goes to her own coffin, where she begins cursing her hastiness.Meanwhile, Tom uses a file on Lena to find her home address. The next night, Lena returns home to visit her mother who has not even noticed her absence. As Lena leaves after saying goodbye to her mother, Tom sees her, but almost does not recognize her due to her different color hairstyle and new fancy clothing. He tells Lena that she could go to prison for violating her 18-month probation for auto theft if he arrested her for stealing the credit card, but says he won't because her victim (Wasja) used women. The two have coffee and talk, but when Lena suddenly sees Louise approaching, she uses her Lamborghini to retreat to the vampire's nightclub.At the club, Lena finds Charlotte in a private room where Charlotte (finally speaking for the first time) tells Lena that she was a silent movie actress in the 1920s and that she had a husband and daughter. However, Charlotte was ashamed at herself for she was a closeted lesbian in denial of her sexuality until she first met Louise who turned and encouraged Charlotte to abandon her family to settle with her new life. Louise enters the room and asks Lena why she is acting different. Lena lies that she misses the sun, so Louise takes the girls to an indoor swimming pool area called Tropical Islands Resort that has artificial sunlight allowing them to have a pool party ""in the sun"". Two night watchmen (Christian Näth and Tom Jahn) find the girls and ask how they managed to get inside. Nora convinces the men to join them in the pool where she quickly kills off one of them, but as water slows the vampires down, the other tries to escape. Charlotte kills this man in a sadistic manner, slicing his throat with a piece of paper which causes him to die slowly and painfully. Lena flees the scene in terror.Meanwhile, Tom and his partner, Lummer (Arved Birnbaum), interrogate the surviving Russian mobster van Gough (Ivan Shvedoff) who says that ""the devil"" killed his friends and stole his Lamborghini. As van Gogh describes it Tom realizes that the stolen car is the car he saw Lena drive.Nora awakes with a bellboy (Neil Belakhdar) she had flirted with (making it known that Nora is actually bisexual). She tries to wake him, but realizes she killed him when they had sex. Nora breaks down in tears as the other girls come into the room. Louise shows her that the SEK (German SWAT unit) is invading the building. Charlotte says she will stall them while the girls make their escape. The vampires have special cars with tinted windows to protect them from sunlight if they ever had to escape during daylight. Lena and Louise take one car while Nora drives alone. The police, who think the girls are simply dangerous criminals, are slaughtered by Charlotte. Tom enters the room looking for Lena and manages to shoot Charlotte before she attacks him, causing her to fall out the window and to the ground. As the sun starts to burn her skin, Lena and Louise manage to get her inside their car. Nora crashes into a car and is thrown into sunlight. Police open fire at the other car letting in sunlight on the vampires. Unable to save Nora, they drive away as Charlotte looks back at Nora burning to death and screaming in agony. The roof of the car is ripped off by a roadblock and the girls crash into a subway to escape the scourging sunlight.The three remaining vampire girls (Lena, Charlotte and Louise) hide at the abandoned Teufelsberg (The Devil's Mountain) where Louise has kept cash. Louise angrily blames Lena for leading the police to them and for Nora's death. Now wanted by the police, the girls prepare to escape to Moscow to make their new home there. Before leaving, Charlotte demands to see her elderly daughter.At a local retirement home, Charlotte sings a lullaby to her dying daughter whom in her last moments recognizes her mother. With a whole day before their departure flight to Russia, the girls return to their hideout to perform their morning ritual. As the sun rises, Charlotte locks Lena and Louise inside and allows the sun to kill her. Louise screams at Charlotte to open the door as she and Lena break down into tears as they hear Charlotte's dying screams.Lena goes to Tom to say good bye and show him who she really is (She forces him to shoot her and the wound heals in front of his eyes). Lena begins to cry while Tom holds her and they fall asleep. Lummer, who has suspected Tom of having some involvement with the girl since the hotel attack, has the SEK invade the building. Lena almost kills the policemen but is stopped by Tom's plea, leading to their arrest and incarceration.Louise goes to the watchmen while they're in the shower and kills them (director Dennis Gansel plays one of the cops getting killed). After that she asks Lena how she will manage to live with Tom, a human, because he will die in 60 years or less while she will never age and then she'll be alone. Louise kidnaps Tom, and Lena follows her. The sun is rising when they meet and Louise finally says to Lena, ""I love you"". Lena (who is really straight) tells Louise that she loves her back. Louise says that that's the most beautiful lie she's ever heard and shoots Tom. Louise and Lena have a fight and Lena throws Louise out a window into the sunlight, where she dies with a peaceful smile on her face. Lena runs to the wounded Tom and wants to bite him to make him a vampire like her so they can live together forever, but stops, kisses him and begins to cry.In the final scene, the SEK troops arrive with Lummer. Lena and Tom are both gone with no trace other than Louise's gun. Lummer looks outside and sees something the other policemen and the audience don't. Lummer whispers ""good luck"" and walks away from the scene."

She also tells him that she has someone who will cross them across the border to Canada, but it will cost them ten thousand dollars.Natalie is taken to the basement and meets the hostages. Initially, she is nice to the hostages, thanking George for saving her son, and even tells Lydia to assist him. She also apologizes to the hostages for her children's mistake, explaining it is all a misunderstanding and she will be leaving in the morning after Johnny gets better. She learns that her sons have been sending her money every month, since she lost the house. She tries to ask Beth and Daniel, politely, for the money, but after they tell her that they have no idea of what she is talking about, she thinks that they are hiding it, and tries to get them to cave, by forcing Addley and Ike to break Daniel's hand.Afterwards, Natalie robs the hostages, and makes them write down their ATM pin numbers. As she tells Beth to go with Ike to withdraw all the money from their debit cards, Melissa quickly gets up, and runs upstairs, with Addley going after her. as she reaches the door, George attacks Addley, but is hit in the face with the gun.

Downstairs, in the basement, the hostages begin to split into two groups, as one wants to fight back, while the other wants to listen to the family. Lydia then appears and takes Annette upstairs, where she is forced to serve ice cream. She quickly realizes that George is still alive, and that Natalie just wants to protect her children.Beth and Ike pull over at an ATM, where Beth begins to withdraw the money, when two young party girls, Vicky Rice (A.J. Cook) and Jenna Luther (Alexa Vega) pull up in their car and get in line behind them, mocking Beth for taking so long. While Ike tries to get the women to go to another ATM, Beth tries to get Vicky's attention and warns her to leave, but before the two girls can, Ike realizes what is going on, and holds them hostage. Ike then teaches Beth a lesson (as they had an argument earlier that murder is human nature) by giving the girls one knife, and telling them that whoever kills the other, will get to live. Vicky picks the knife up, but quickly drops it after Jenna pleads. Ike then decides to kill them both, so Jenna kills Vicky. Jenna hears an ambulance, and runs towards it, but is shot down by Ike in the process.Back at house, Annette tries to get the others to listen, as Natalie is only helping her sons, only to be ignored by Treshawn. In the dump, two sanitation workers pull over, and find a whimpering Melissa behind the dumpster, and call the police. Lydia is in the restroom, trying to wash off some blood from her shirt, when George walks in. He finds her pills on the floor, and she informs him that she must take them because of her sensitive skin. George tells her that the pills are sugar, and learns she never saw a doctor, and was also home schooled. He then tells her that her mother lied to have Lydia cover herself up, so that boys don't notice her. He gives her his shirt, and she takes it, just as Natalie walks in on them. She warns George to stay away from her. As they hear the news, police officer Skay (Mike O'Brien), pulls over and Natalie forces Daniel to send the officer away, threatening to hurt Beth. Daniel co-operates with the officer, and sends him away. After being sent downstairs, Natalie realizes Daniel is a good liar, and tells Lydia to look for the money downstairs. There, Lydia finds a Valentine's Day card to Julie, from Daniel.Meanwhile, Ike tells Beth that they don't have enough money, so Beth tells him how Treshawn owns a dry cleaner's. Ike gives Beth the phone, and calls Treshawn to ask him for the safe's pass code. Treshawn does so, and also tells Beth he has a gun in the cabinet.As Johnny begins to bleed, he breaks down to his Mother, and tells her he doesn't want to die a virgin, breaking his Mother's heart. George, who asked to get cleaned up, finds Lydia, and asks who Queenie is, a name he heard earlier. A scared Lydia tells him the story of Queenie, a monster who her mother says lives in the woods, and punishes bad kids. Although she doesn't believe the story, she is still traumatized by the sounds she hears outside.Down in the basement, the hostages are trying to keep calm, when Addley comes down the stairs, and tells them that one of the women is getting lucky by popping his younger brother's cherry. As he asks who they choose to send upstairs, everyone turns their back on Julie, so Addley drags her upstairs. An angry Treshawn grabs a pool stick and runs after them, but Mother quickly brings Julie back downstairs, stating she is not worthy of her son, and quickly lays her eyes on Gina, after Treshawn tries to be the ""strong man"". She finds Gina perfect, and tells Addley to take Gina upstairs, who breaks down, and tells them that Dave works at a bank, and he and Annette are not friends of hers, nor Treshawn's. Mother Natalie, not knowing who to pick, forces Treshawn and Dave to fight, and the loser's woman will be forced upstairs. As the two men decline, she threatens to take both women. As Addley plays the song ""Whack-A-Doo"", Dave and Treshawn fight, as their women cheer for them not to give up. Treshawn ends up winning, and Annette is dragged upstairs by Addley. Back upstairs, Johnny has stopped breathing, and George is trying to convince Lydia to change her mind, as she is not like her family, but Lydia shows she loves her family, and will not turn against them. As Johnny is revived, Addley walks in with Annette, and calls his mother. Lydia notices what is going on, and warns her Mother that what she plans to do is not right, but Mother tells Lydia that they are lying to them, and are hiding the money.At the dry cleaner's, Beth mixes the combination numbers to buy some time at getting Treshawn's gun. After Ike opens the safe, and gets the money, Beth gets the gun, and points it at Ike. As he gives her the cellphone, Ike reaches for the gun, and Beth hits him in the head with an iron. She runs and hides in the clothes, after finding the doors locked. Ike begins taunting her, while she is on hold with the police. As she reaches the police, Ike catches her.Back at the house, Mother is makes Annette change into something more ""decent"". While looking through a box which contains pictures of a boy, and various newspaper articles, it is concluded Daniel and Beth have been having problems after their son was run over. Annette pleads that she believed Mother that no one would be hurt, but Mother ignores her pleads, and takes her to Johnny. As George tries to protect Annette, Lydia is forced to take him away, where they try to tune out the screams. Annette is forced to strip for Johnny, as Mother forces Annette to touch Johnny, who seems to feel pity for Annette. As they are about to begin, Johnny wounds begin to bring pain, and Annette is forced downstairs to the basement, after George tells her to go to the ""gold box"". Downstairs, Treshawn is able to unlock the basement doors, but is forced to retrieve back when Addley bursts downstairs with Annette. He taunts Dave by smacking Annette's butt, which causes Dave to attack Addley. As Gina runs to open the basement doors, Treshawn runs to help Dave, only for Addley to accidentally shoot Dave in the face, causing it to explode. As Addley apologizes, a hysterical Annette runs to her dead boyfriend, while Mother notices Gina is escaping. Mother turns to Daniel, and threatens to kill Beth if he doesn't bring Gina back. Ignoring Treshawn's pleads, Daniel runs after Gina, who has found no help as the tornado is getting closer. Gina hears Daniel, and pleads for him to go with her, as Mother will not let any of them live. Daniel declines, and tries to get Gina to go back with him, who doesn't agree, and tries to run away. Daniel grabs her, but Gina squeezes his broken hand, before fleeing after an ambulance. Daniel takes off after her, and pushes her down.Elsewhere, at the hospital, Melissa is rushed into the ER, but is unable to say what has happened to her, as they have drugged her. The tornado has brought a heavy storm, and Ike and Beth are almost at the house, when Officer Skay pulls them over, citing that he is forced to bring people to a shelter. Beth lets him know that she and her ""husband"" are on their way home, which is less than a mile away. Beth gives Skay the insurance, which includes her and Daniel's name. Skay sees the insurance, and understands that Beth is being held hostage. He tricks Ike by confusing Beth and Daniel's last name, ""Sohapi"" and ""so happy"". Ike falls for the confusion, and Skay makes him turn off the car. Ike, knowing the officer is on to him, gets out of the car, and shoots Skay down. He makes Beth drive, but then makes her run over Skay, as he is wearing a vest, but Beth flips the car over at the last minute.Meanwhile, Gina wakes up in the basement, with Mother standing over her, Addley boiling water, and Lydia pointing a gun at her. Mother lets Gina know that she will have to be punished. Mother gets out of sight, and Treshawn is now tied up in a column, with plastic wrap. Mother informs Gina that she will be punished by punishing Treshawn instead of her. Addley gets the boiling water, and burns Treshawn's ears. The hot water also goes into his eyes. Julie, Annette, and Daniel watch this in horror, as they are also tied up in a column with plastic wrap. Gina also watches in horror, not being able to do anything, as Lydia points a gun at her the whole time.Back at the storm, Skay gets up, being slightly injured, and goes to Beth's aide. Beth is injured, and lets Skay know that Ike is not moving. As Skay approaches to help Beth, Ike opens his eyes, and points the gun at Skay's forehead, before pulling the trigger, as Beth cries. Mother begins to walk around, thinking for a way to make Daniel give up the money, when she finds the box with his son's memories, and takes it to Daniel, where she taunts him with them. Daniel cries, as Mother burns a picture, and asks for the money. Daniel cries that he doesn't have it, angering Mother, who continues to burn all of his stuff. Mother then turns to Julie, and makes Addley drop liquor on her head, before burning her head. Mother then quickly goes to Julie, and puts the fire out, stating that ""Marriage is sacred"". As she goes upstairs, Mother begins to question whether she was doing wrong, torturing an innocent, so she begins to look around for the money. Gina, now tied up with plastic wrap on the floor, finds a way to get up. She turns on the chimney, and puts her bound hands through it, burning the plastic wrap off. She unties herself, and quickly goes to Treshawn. At the hospital, Melissa is able to wake up during operation, and warns the doctor that Beth is in trouble. The doctors get the police.Meanwhile, Annette remembers the gold box that George told her about, and tells Gina to open it. As Gina opens it and finds knives, Mother finds a painting in the restroom. She grabs it, and finds all the money that her sons have been sending her inside it. She orders Addley to bring Daniel upstairs. Addley goes to the basement and finds Treshawn missing, but before he can react, Daniel attacks him, and Gina puts plastic wrap over his face. Daniel and Annette then take turns stabbing him, as he apologizes for what he has done. Julie is also about to stab him, but drops him, showing remorse. Treshawn, now half deaf and blind, grabs Addley's gun, and goes upstairs to try and kill Mother. Gina goes after him, trying to stop him, but Treshawn does not hear her. She surprises Treshawn, who reacts quickly, and shoots her in the side. As he realizes what he did, Mother shoots him dead. Mother goes to the basement, and finds Addley dead. She calls Ike, and makes Daniel say goodbye to Beth. As he lets Beth know he is sorry, Mother shoots Daniel dead, as Beth listens, and breaks down. Mother then tells Ike that Addley is dead, and to bring Beth home. Ike then begins to grieve his brother's death.Back at the house, Lydia ties Julie and Annette with plastic wrap again. George begins to tell Mother that none of her kids look like one another, and look nothing like her. Mother, enraged, threatens to kill him, but Lydia convinces her that they need George. Ike and Beth then burst through the front door, and Mother lets Ike know Beth and Daniel had the money all along, and makes George and Lydia help Ike take Johnny to the RV. Mother reveals to Julie and Annette that Beth was the one who hid the money and is the one responsible for all their friend's deaths. Beth then reveals that she was hiding the money for the baby that she will have. She also reveals she knew Daniel was cheating, and wanted to leave him. Mother, now enraged, makes her take a pregnancy test.In the RV, Ike tells George he must now shoot George, as they don't need him anymore, but Lydia pleads that he can come with him.

He collects a treat from the hidden box under the stairs and cycles off to work in the Peacock State Bank. Once in his office, Mr. French (Bill Pullman) comes in to give him a pile of work and his pay slip.After work John stops by the river and chucks things around, he is emptying the contents of a bag he is holding, when he comes across a hand written note from Emma, which he looks down at, and smiles. He jumps onto the tire swing and sways looking up at the trees. On the way home, he stops by at the shop and bumps into Louise (Eden Bodnar) who invites him over for dinner as she says he must get lonely in his house. John returns home with the shopping, gets his dinner out of the fridge, which is accompanied by a handwritten note, which makes him laugh a little and soon after goes up to bed.The next morning, we hear the loud noises of the train nearby, Emma is taking down the washing in the garden, when all of a sudden the train comes crashing through the fence and Emma is unconscious for a short while. When she wakes up, lots of people are gathered around her and Louise questions who she is and how she knows John.

The officer also mentioned that when he knocked on the door to check if the lady was ok, nobody answered and people in the town said that it was Johns wife.The officer talks about how he told John what to do with the house and everything when his mum died. John wants the train gone as soon as possible as it is bringing everyone in the community to his house and they are all asking questions. John is quite worried about this because, he'll need to create some kind of cover story about Emma.Emma hears something at the door, so opens the door slowly and peers out. It's the neighbors Connor Black (Graham Beckel) a senior political advisor and Fanny Crill (Susan Sarandon), they are holding a newspaper. A bird flies in and the neighbors rush in to try and get it out again. Emma asks them to get out the house very quietly, but in a polite way. They are hoping to speak to Mr. Skillpa, as they want to discuss how John would feel if they used the train as a backdrop for a rally in the backyard, as the train was part of a campaign they were running. Connor talks to Emma about how he needs her and John's help for this, Fanny shows Emma the newspaper and there is a photograph of Emma on the front page, Emma does not really know how to react.

Emma helps Maggie into the house with Jake and puts Jake to bed; there is a knock on the door. Maggie explains how John's mother made him do horrible things. Maggie opens a small box in the room next door and gets out the birth certificate to show Emma that John is Jake's father. Emma looks shocked, but does not say anything.

Emma lies down on the bed.Emma makes a phone call and springs a question about wanting to adopt Jake. Emma turns up to the shelter to let Fanny know that they can go ahead with the rally.

When Emma gets home, she hangs the washing up outside and then goes to the broken step to get out the old box and finds a key and a bankbook. Emma goes to the bedroom and just sits there quietly. There is a loud knock at the door and John comes running down the stairs to answer it. It is Fanny; she has a gift for John and Emma to say thank you. Ray sits waiting in the car outside and says to John that he does not have to bother coming into work today. Fanny walks back to the car and John slams the door shut and turns the light on. John walks over to his breakfast on the table and takes the top plate off which is covering it. He picks up his breakfast plate and chucks it in the sink; it smashes.

John opens the present from Fanny and Ray Crill; it is a small photo frame, he puts it down and holds his head in his hands. John then walks over to the table again; to see his breakfast on the table and the sink empty. He is a little confused and has to take a double take. This time when he takes the top plate off, he is more satisfied than previously; picks up his serviette ready to eat and then hears voices outside. John rushes over to the door and Officer Tom McGonigle is there, he asks John to bring his wife out so that they can both go over the accident form with him. John is a bit overwhelmed by the situation and is not really sure how to handle it, so makes a fuss and says that he does not want the rally to happen.

In this time, John decides to repair the fence the train had broken.John goes to a workshop to ask a guy if he could remove the train from his back garden, he demands 800 in cash.

John tells Maggie that he will giver her money as he wants her and Jake to get out of Peacock because it is not safe in Peacock.

John rings on the doorbell at a nearby motel; he has turned up with a small bag and asks for a room. John is unsure of how long he needs the room for when he is asked. John sits down on a chair in his motel room, tilts his head back and closes his eyes for a short time. John opens the bag and is shocked to see his mother's blue and white dress folded up in his bag. John slowly backs away from the bag. Back home, Emma is wearing John's mother's dress and eating breakfast at the table. Emma draws open all of the curtains and someone knocks on the door. Emma opens the door and it is the guy from the workshop, John asked him to remove the train yesterday. Fanny pulls up at the house and asks if she knows where Maggie is as she is not at the shelter.

John sparks the question to Mr. French: ""What would you do without me?"" Mr. French simply replies, ""Find someone more reliable.""

The girls spend the night playing pranks until they learn the truth about the suicidal jumper Stacy St. Clair, who had jumped off from a bridge and found dead miles away.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The movie begins with Chapin (Britt Robertson) sneaking out of her house to go to Eve's (Alexia Fast). Eve is having a birthday party, and is waiting for her father to call. The doorbell rings, and it's Liza (Scout Taylor-Compton). Liza tells Eve that her mother made her come, and asks Eve if she wants her to leave. Eve refuses, saying that she'll get in trouble if she makes Liza leave. They agree to be civil to one another.Liza joins Cecily (Janel Parrish), Sarah (Emily Tennant) and Nina (Carly McKillip) at the party. They're essentially Stepford Wives. Liza sits by herself, feeding pizza to a rat she keeps in her bag; her only friend.Chapin shows up, an exact foil to Nina, Cecily and Sarah. They go upstairs, but not before Chapin corners Liza. She tells her that she's not gonna ruin Eve's birthday, so she's gonna be civil to Liza, but they're not gonna be 'down' until Liza apologizes. Liza refuses.Flashback to 4 days earlier. Chapin and Eve are talking in the hall when Whisper, a friend of Chapin's that Eve likes, and his friends walk up. He pulls the whole 'points-to-chest-person-looks-down-flicks-them-in-the-chin' thing with Chapin, obviously flirting with her, and ignoring Eve, who is pretty much just staring at him longingly. Eve is then shown with her soccer team, running warm-ups. As they run across what's known as The Jogger Bridge, every girl kisses her hand and sets it on the railing. Kayla (Valerie Tian) tells Eve to do so also, to 'pay her respects'. When Eve asks why they do that, Kayla tells her it's in memory of Stacey St. Clair (Julia Maxwell), a girl from Sacred Heart, a nearby Catholic school, that jumped off the bridge 5 months ago.In the present, Chapin is bitching about how they're not doing anything fun on Eve's birthday. Everyone gives lame suggestions for things to do, such as sudoku, pedicures, and reading each other's blogs. Chapin hesitantly suggests Triple Dog.Back 4 days ago, Eve asks Kayla and Toni (Laura Carswell), 2 girls on her soccer team about Stacy St. Clair. Toni tells Eve what she heard; that Stacy was at a party where she was given an acid hit. She was tripping and seeing butterflies on her fingers. One flew away, and she jumped off the bridge chasing it.Back in the present, Chapin is explaining the rules of Triple Dog; everyone dumps all their money and their most favorite possession they have with them into 'the pot'.The rules are as follows: 1. Everyone gets and gives a dare.
2. You get to pick who dares you.
3. You have to do your dare, or else you get your head shaved.
4. If you can't complete your dare, you can challenge whoever dared you to complete it. If they do, you get shaved.
5. With the exception of daring someone to shave their head, any dare goes.
6. The whole night will be recorded.At the end, they'll vote for who did their dare best, and whoever wins gets everything.Eve picks Sarah to perform her dare first. Sarah picks Liza to dare her. Liza dares her to streak around the block. Sarah is hesitant to do so, as she is Catholic and very conservative. For fear of getting shaved, she does it, however, she is seen by one of Eve's neighbors and a car full of boys, who take pictures and videos. This is mostly due to Chapin following after her on her skateboard, yelling out about 'Sarah Algreen's virgin vag'.Flashback to 3 days ago. Chapin is sitting in Study Hall playing Mad Libs with Whisper, Clarke (Jeff Ballard) and Stephan (Richard Harmon), who is throwing gummy bears at Liza, who is sitting alone at a nearby table. Liza gives Chapin a dirty look, which annoys her. Liza tells her to tell everyone why she got kicked out of Sacred Heart, and Chapin walks over to her and punches her in the face twice. Whisper has to literally wrestle her away from Liza. Liza is shown talking to Principal Scalco (Brian Markinson), who asks her if she's still carrying around that rat. Liza says no, but he gives her a piece of doughnut to give to the rat, as he knows she's lying. He asks her if she has friends, to which she lies again, saying yes. He tells her to stay away from Chapin. Liza leaves and Chapin walks in. She makes a couple smartass comments, and asks for her detention. Scalco tells her that they have a zero-tolerance assault policy, and suspends her for three days.At her locker, Liza is checking out her bruise when Todd (Norman Gerard Funk), Eve's brother, and a few of his friends comment on her, not caring that she can hear them. Joe (Sefton Fincham) asks Todd if he would 'Superman that ho' for $20, and Todd says for half a million, he'd think about it.Back in the present, Eve picks Liza to go next, and Liza picks Nina to dare her. Nina dares her to stay in Todd's closet until midnight, wearing Nina's Cheerleading outfit. Eve and Chapin lure Todd and his friends out so Liza can infiltrate his closet. Eve asks Todd if he wants to talk to heir father when he calls, and Todd tells her he's not gonna call. The girls give Liza Sarah's number, and demand a photo every half hour so they know she's still in there.Eve picks Nina to go next. Nina picks Eve to dare her. The group drives to a local Western restaurant, where Mallory Silvers (Aubrey Mozino) works. Mallory has short hair, is on the soccer team with Eve, and was kicked out of Sacred Heart along with Chapin and a few others. She is in an embarrassing uniform, which Chapin takes pictures of and blackmails her into helping with Nina's dare by putting Nina's name next on the karaoke list. Nina gets on stage, and fakes a seizure, complete with foaming at the mouth (with the help of Chapin, who gave her Alka-Seltzer to chew on). Mallory's boss (Raugi Yi) tells Mallory to call an ambulance, and yells at her when she refuses. As the girls leave, Mallory pulls Eve aside, asking if she's brought up Stacy St. Clair to Chapin yet. Eve just walks away. The next time Liza sends them a picture, Chapin takes Sarah's phone and calls Liza, forcing her to answer and Todd and his friends to find her. Todd tries to pull her out of his closet, and she bites him. He goes to get his mom to get her out, and she calls him a baby, embarrassing him and blackmailing him with the thought of his mother finding his porn stash, into letting her stay until midnight. His friends leave for a party, but he stays, because he doesn't want to leave Liza alone in his closet.The girls go find Whisper, who tells them that he and his friends are crashing a party at midnight. Chapin says they might go too, after their game. She tells Whisper that they're playing Triple Dog, and he tells her to be careful.Flashback to 2 days earlier. Liza and Eve's moms see each other a the grocery store. Eve finds Liza and asks what she said to Chapin to get her suspended. Liza tells her that she told Chapin to tell everyone why she got expelled. Eve asks why, and Liza tells her that Stacy and Chapin got in a fight, and that Chapin pushed Stacy off the bridge in the heat of the moment.Back in the present, Cecily is up next, and Chapin dares her to pee on Principal Scalco's (who she thinks is sexy) stoop. She drinks a bunch of water to prepare. Cecily gets on his stoop, pulls down her underwear and starts peeing, going unnoticed. Chapin however, isn't gonna let Cecily off the hook that easily, and jumps on Scalco's car, setting off his alarm. He opens the door to Cecily pissing on his Welcome mat, and she runs off.Back in Todd's room, Liza starts crying, realizing that she's having the worst night of her life. Todd tries to sympathize, even spraying air freshener in his closet when she tells him that it smells. She sees him failing at Rock Band, and schools him at Expert mode. He watches her play, noticing how she moves, and realizing that he thinks she's hot. He tries to hit on her, saying that she's not ugly, he's sorry for insulting her a few days earlier, and that if she left the rat at home, she may even get a date. She sees that it's midnight, and comes out of Todd's closet. She says she should go find everyone else, to which Todd replies, ""Or we could bone."" When Liza walks away to change, he asks if he can watch.The girls pull off at a park, and while Sarah comforts Cecily, who's afraid of getting kicked out of Student Council, Nina watches the video, and Chapin and Eve talk. Eve asks Chapin if she likes Whisper, to which Chapin replies that that's a shitty thing to say, because she would never go after someone her friend liked. It's Chapin's turn for a dare, and Cecily dares her to steal a Penthouse from a gas station, even though the porn is behind the counter, and there's a security guard on duty. Chapin is reluctant, and Cecily offers to do it herself, and Sarah explains that Cecily's father owns the station.Todd drops Liza off at the gas station, and tells Eve that their father still hasn't called. He says good-bye to Liza, and they share a 'look' (it's my interpretation that even if they didn't have sex, they at least hooked up in some way).
Chapin completes her dare, distracting the clerk and the guard by microwaving a metal can of baked beans and exploding the microwave. In addition to the Penthouse, she stole ointment for Liza (evidence that she slept with Todd), condoms for Sarah (to mock her), hair gel for Nina and a bottle of champagne for Eve. Cecily makes a comment about Chapin getting busted by the security camera, and Chapin produces the videotape from the camera from her vest.Eve is the last dare-ee, and Sarah is the last dare-er. Chapin told her earlier what to dare Eve with, so Sarah dares Eve to go to third base with (give a blow job to) Whisper.Flashback to the day before, when Mallory and Eve are at soccer practice together. Eve asks Mallory what happened with Stacy, and Mallory says that she doesn't talk about Stacy or Sacred Heart, but tells Eve to ask Chapin.Back in the present, the girls arrive at the party where Mallory, Whisper and his friends, and Todd and his friends are. Eve asks Chapin about Stacy St. Clair, and Chapin says that she didn't even know Stacy, and that she (and assumably Mallory, also) was expelled from Sacred Heart simply because she was at the party. Eve sees how Todd is looking at Liza and asks if he was mad when he found her. Liza tells her that he got over it. Todd intercepts Liza and leads her off to a private room.Chapin and Whisper walk outside together and Chapin tells him what her dare was. She tells him she has no intention of ever shaving her head, and he tells her she'd still be hot. Chapin pretty much figures out that he's got a crush on her, and leaves, luring him into the arms of Eve, who dances with him for a while before leading him downstairs.Sarah sits down and starts knitting, and Stephan sits beside her. He is amused with her knitting, and she starts to teach him how. He gives her a flask, and she drink liquor for the first time. Someone texts him a picture of her streaking, and she gets embarrassed, but gets over it. She tells him that streaking was liberating, that even though she's a 'good' girl that she wants to rage occasionally, too. She even says 'fuck' twice when Chapin takes her downstairs to videotape Eve's dare.Eve and Whisper kiss a little, and she starts to go down on him, but he stops her, saying that even though she's cute, he's into Chapin. Eve had suspected this, and she storms off. The girls run after her, and Chapin sees Todd and Liza come out of a room, both of them with clothes and hair disheveled.Chapin drags Whisper into a room, yelling at him for not hooking up withe Eve. She tells him about her being upset that her father hasn't called and that now, if he doesn't hook up with her, she has to get her head shaved. She asks him if she kisses him, if he'll hook up with Eve. She kisses him, but pushes him away when he tries to kiss her again.
She says about the game, ""It's supposed to be fun, and then everything goes wrong,"" to which Whisper replies with, ""Like with Stacy?"" He tells Chapin that accidents happen, and what happened to Stacy wasn't Chapin's fault. She gets mad at him, saying that she shouldn't have even told him about it, and yelling at him to shut up, before storming out.Eve finds Mallory. Mallory mentions Stacy St. Clair, and Chapin walks up. Mallory explains to the whole group (and half the party) that yes, Stacy did jump off the bridge... Because someone dared her to.Flashback to the night of Stacy's death. Stacy, Mallory and Chapin, along with a few other girls are playing Triple Dog. Mallory's head is shaved, which explains why her hair is so short in the present. Stacy's up, and she picks Chapin to dare her. Chapin triple dog dares her to jump off The Jogger Bridge. Mallory warns them that the dare is stupid, but when Chapin mentions that there's $280 in the pot, Stacy agrees to do it. Stacy gets on the railing, and blows a kiss to the group before she jumps. She loses control in the current, and drowns.In the present, Chapin says that she didn't know about the current, and that people jump off the bridge all the time and survive. Mallory says that Chapin had to be the center of attention, so she dared Stacy to do something that she couldn't. Chapin takes this personally, running off to the bridge. Everyone runs after her, including Mallory, Stephan and Whisper. Chapin gets to the bridge, climbing on the rail. Everyone is begging her not to jump, but she blows them a kiss, like Stacy had done, and jumps in the river.Everyone runs to the river bank, but the only thing they see is her shoe. Most of the group run to the other side of the river, looking for her there. Eve and Liza stay, and Chapin walks up behind them, alive and unscathed. Eve yells at her for being stupid and selfish and attacks her, but Liza separates them. Chapin gets angry at Eve, saying that she needed to see for herself, because it was her fault. She tearfully confesses to Liza and Eve that she did dare Stacy to jump, and that the current was rough, but she didn't know how rough it was. She admits that Stacy's death was her fault, even though Liza and Eve tell her it was an accident. They all walk back up to the bridge arm in arm, and the group runs separate ways as police sirens approach.The girls vote, with everyone but Cecily (and of course, Chapin) voting for Chapin. Cecily mentions that technically, they have to shave Eve's head, because she didn't complete her dare. Eve stops waiting for her father to call, instead taking initiative and calling him. He yells at her for calling so late. She literally screams in frustration, then agrees to have her head shaved. Chapin shaves her. Before Chapin heads home, she tells Eve that nobody in their right mind would leave a friend like her behind. It seems as if everyone is friends, even Chapin and Liza and Chapin and Cecily.The next morning, Chapin returns to the bridge. She steps up to the side, kissing her hand and setting it on the railing before walking away."

Broke students Lea (Anna Rot) and Hanna (Magdalena Kronschläger), instead of working as waitresses, both decide to work as escort girls because they think they can earn bigger, better money. They also had bad sex before, so why not make a living with sex? Between curiosity and bewilderment, they plunge into an adventure between day and night. They quickly learn how to deal with their ""suitors"": they always make their clients feel special. Their clients turn out to be quite normal family fathers, bored or stressed-out managers, commercial travelers, young men--all in search of sexual adventures. Despite their small perversions, they are rarely unsympathetic, so sometimes there is room for happiness. Slowly this job seems to please them and soon it is just part of their everyday life. Normal life is escaping them more and more and more--how to combine studies with escort service? student with call girl? It doesn't take long for the first conflicts to emerge and they exceed their own limits and ask themselves seriously how far they would go for money. At the beginning of the film are the two Viennese students Hanna and Lea. Both come from the countryside , both are new to the city and both keep afloat with temporary jobs in the catering trade . Since there is not enough money from the waiters at the back and front, they decide to consider the job offer of an escort agency. The agency is operated by Mario and his wife Sissi. The agency is small; the manners accordingly informal. Sissi teaches the basics of the pay sex industry in a rather casual way. Sissi's advice to Lea: ""You have to give the customer the feeling that he is something special. If you can do that, you are something special for him, understand? "" And: "" Perfume and body lotion must be from the same brand . A smell, a story, remember that. More confuses the men . "" This was the first rule. Rule number two is loud: cash in beforehand.The balancing act between studies, pay-sex business and private life is initially rather unspectacular. Lea meets Claus, an old acquaintance from the village, in the disco . When she is about to get involved in a tech deal with him, she is ordered to a customer. Meanwhile, art history student Hanna befriends Harald ( Adrian Topol ), whom she met while studying, but leaves him in the dark about her part-time job. The meetings with the escort customers are presented as rather casual, incidental, sometimes banal. There is the old man wearing women's underwear under his clothes. There is the alert young manager who wants a special kick and likes to have sex in the elevator . The nice family man who steals away from his family for pay sex. The inhibited, dependent sprout from a good family. At first glance, all of these meetings remain on the surface - whereby the new job not only comes up with situation comedy, but also with uncomplicated, generally pleasant meetings. Joy and suffering: Pay sex - a job just like any other.As the film progresses, the different worlds become more and more confused. Lea, who wants to study acting , fails the entrance examination at the drama school . The escort meetings are more and more about the substance. Subtle but ubiquitous border crossings are increasing, as is the increasing estrangement from studying. Step by step notice Lea and Hanna: The two worlds are not easily compatible with each other - they are not even clearly separable. A key experience is the unexpected meeting of Hanna and Harald again - this time in the form of a customer date for which she was ordered. An experience that forces both women to make a decision is meeting a businessman who starts in a pleasant atmosphere and ends in massive border crossings. The end of the film: Lea gives up the pay-sex job and returns disillusioned to the country. Hanna calls herself Lea and continues. However, the friendship between the two has irrevocably broken."

Out of the blue, the washed up boxer Anton ""The Pro"" Protopov (Robert Maillet) comes to his office to hire him to find his missing girlfriend and former stripper Lexie Persimmon. Cruz recalls that five years ago, the Russian mobster Skinny Faddeev gave $30,000,000 in blood diamonds in advance to him to lose a fight against his nephew. However, Anton killed the nephew with one punch, and when Skinny was found dead, he was sentenced to life. While in prison, Lexie writes 260 letters to him and they fall in love. When a criminal confesses to the murder of Skinny, Anton is released, but he does not find Lexie. Ned Cruz starts the investigation and finds a lead that Lexie might be in San Celeritas, New Mexico.

Meanwhile, the physicist Simon's experiment destroys his lab and creates a giant crevasse. Ned and Julie speed away in the car, and they later pick up Fay, who happens to be their co-accomplice."

Sal goes ballistic, and then attempts to push Bruce out of the plane, but not before Sara knocks him out. However, the thing outside continues to chase after the plane and eventually takes Sal too.Sara begins to panic, claiming that everyone is dead because of her, but it is then that Bruce reveals that he is to blame.

Sara is overjoyed at seeing sunlight, and the radio begins working with the voices of (Colin Murdock and Ian James Corlett). However, Bruce's fears re-manifest themselves when he realizes the kiss she gave him was not genuine, but simply a way to divert his attention.

However, Sara cries out to Bruce to think of his parents, and think of anywhere else but where they are.Bruce manages to concentrate, and the storm and the creature disappears again. Pulling her into the plane, the two take a seat when suddenly, they see they are now in the path of an oncoming small plane! For a split-second, Sara and Bruce see who is in it: Sara's mother and a young Bruce and his parents. The planes just barely miss colliding with each other, but Bruce and Sara are now doomed as the fuel runs out, and the plane plummets.The ending of the film cuts to Sara's mother having safely landed the airplane. Sara and her father greet her, as their attention is then turned towards smoke on the horizon (Bruce and Sara's plane, having crashed). As the group wonder if the people in the plane survived, young Bruce and young Sara say hello for the first time (note: it is assumed that since Sara and Bruce have somehow altered time, the previous events (Sara's mother and Bruce's parents dying in the plane crash) never happened, and Sara is able to now grow up with her mother, and Bruce is able to live his life with his parents))."

Also in the barn away from the noise of the party is their youngest brother Luke Moore (Anthony de Liseo) asleep amongst the hay together with their dog Stoner.
Sarah woke up Luke and learned that their parents were fighting over bills and a supposed love affair of their mother with another man. She told Luke to go back to sleep and sent Stoner back home.

Stephen then told her that her step father accused their mother of having an affair with someone and that she is paying this man huge sums of money. Sarah can't believe that her mother is having an affair.
Everyone went back to the house. There was a power outage caused by the storm. Inside, the pack went up the stairs and noticed blood dripping at the top of the stairs. Meanwhile, Gary separates from the group and ended up in the kitchen in order to look for candles. The group upstairs followed the marks of blood on the carpet and they saw that it came from their father's room. When they entered the room, everyone was shocked to see the lifeless body of their father that seemed to have been attacked by some wild animal. The rib cage can clearly be seen with some internal organs missing. Almost at the same time, Gary saw some candles and dropped them. When he reached down to get them, he saw the collar of Stoner and the bloody remains of the dog.
The group upstairs suddenly saw a beast like creature which immediately attacked them. Luckily, they were able to close the door before the beast could reach them. The beast keeps on pounding furiously against the closed door when Gary called out to them. The beast immediately heard Gary and went after him and killed him the same way - ripping his internal organs out.

When the beast started to pound the door of the bathroom also, Sarah saw a passageway inside the bathroom going to the attic. Everyone went up it and for a moment in time they were saved.
In the attic, the group contemplated on what they are going to do. Sarah mentioned that they needed to get help and her mobile phone is in her bag downstairs. Stephen's phone is dead. Sarah remembered Luke was left sleeping at the barn. Sarah then said that there is a phone in their father's room. Emily saw a pathway in the attic that leads to another opening in another room. They devised a plan in order to get to the phone. Sarah would go down through the other pathway and make distract the beast while Charlie goes down to their father's bathroom back into their father's room and use the phone there to call for help.
The monster heard Sarah's screams to get it's attention and ran towards her. Meanwhile, Charlie was able to reach the phone and he tried calling the police. Sarah went back to the other opening in the attic when she noticed that the creature had stopped following her. She went outside to look for the creature and realized that it is after Charlie. Charlie was able to contact the police and mentioned about the wild animal in their house before he was attacked and killed by the beast. Sarah saw that Charlie was already being devoured by the beast. It then went after Sarah, who immediately tried to go back up the attic. Unfortunately, the beast was able to get hold and bite her leg before she managed to make her way up to the attic.

McRae is a trained dog catcher and was enlisted by the police department to help in resolving the situation. May thinks that the report is a hoax but went there instead to be sure.

Stephen saw another passageway from the attic which lead to another room containing a shotgun. Once inside the room, Sarah and Doug warned them that the beast is lurking outside the room and told them to get out. Emily and Stephen manage to block the door after a little bit of struggle. While Emily is looking for shotgun cartridges, Stephen leaves her and crawls back up to the attic. Sarah armed with a stake makes her way down where she injures the beast before it attacks Emily.

Meanwhile, McRae with officer May see an abandoned car in the middle of the road and stop to investigate. They come to the conclusion, after finding that the woman did not take her handbag, that the car broke down but the driver seeking for help never made it back so the call they received earlier may not be a hoax. As they leave, a pile of clothes is shown a few feet away from the car.
Luke wakes up and goes back to the house unaware of the situation that is going on. He finds Gary's dead body in the hall way. The beast, now aware of his presence, is after him.

Sarah says that if their mother is dead then Stephen is the one to blame. An upset Stephen knocks her unconscious but Sarah awakens and hits Stephen. A scared Stephen runs out of the barn and he is attacked by the beast. Inside the barn Sarah starts to transforms into a monstrous figure.
Luke and Doug run back to the house where the beast comes back. They hide under the table and just as soon as the beast is about to kill them, a beast-like Sarah attacks and fights with the other beast. Luke runs back to the car while Doug tries to shoot at the beast but is eventually bitten and killed by Sarah. In the morning Sarah has returned to her human self. The other beast is revealed to be Sarah's mother. Sarah finds Luke inside the car and they both drive off to go somewhere safe. Just before the credits roll, it is revealed that Gary is still alive."

There is a train station on the other side of death, yet not all who arrive on the platform will be judged ready for passage onwards. For one unready soul, there will be both a test and a second chance. Rather than be reborn, this soul will awake in the body of 14-year-old suicide Makoto Kobayashi where it must not only find a way to fit into Makoto's existence, but also unravel two mysteries. What is the secret of the great sin it committed in its own previous life and what were the reasons that led to Makoto's suicide? While some may believe the truth to be as plain to see as black and white, ""Makoto"" soon finds that the real world is overlaid with so many shades of grey and rainbows of colors that even the most obvious of ""facts"" are not what they seem. With the soul's time in Makoto's body quickly running out, the answers to all life's mysteries await discovery.—itsterr Having no recollection of who he was on Earth, a nameless, dejected young soul known only as ""I"" arrives at the gloomy train station to the afterlife. But, all is not lost. Presented with a generous choice, ""I"" accepts the unexpected offer of his ashen spirit-guide, Pura-Pura, and gets a second chance at life in the body of the fourteen-year-old suicide, Makoto Kobayashi. However, this proposal comes with strings attached. Now, to move on to the other side, ""I"" needs to figure out his sin, and try to right a wrong in a limited amount of time. But, what was his past life's biggest mistake in the first place? Will ""I"" ever find atonement?—Nick Riganas Upon reaching the train station to death, a dejected soul is informed that he is 'lucky' and will have another chance at life though he does not want it. He is placed in the body of a 14-year-old boy named Makoto Kobayashi, who has just committed suicide by an overdose of pills. Watched over by a neutral spirit named Purapura in the form of a little boy, the soul must figure out what his greatest sin and mistake in his former life was before his six-month time limit in Makoto's body runs out. He also has a number of other lesser duties he must complete, such as understanding what led Makoto to commit suicide in the first place and learning how to enjoy his second chance at life.
He finds Makoto did not like his family and he greatly dislikes them for the same reasons. He is contemptuous of his father who is an underdog at work, forced to work lots of unpaid overtime. Despite her efforts, he hates his mother who had an affair with a dance instructor, something his father seems to be oblivious of. His older brother Mitsuru has given up on him because he is too moody and has no friends at school or anywhere else. He discovers that a girl (Hiroka) he fancies sells sex to older men so she can have the clothes and things she wants. Shoko is a weird girl from Makoto's class who becomes suspicious of his unusual behavior so he tries to stay away from her. After he gets mugged and beaten up by some delinquents, Shoko comes to visit Makoto at his house, but he scares her off. In one of their subsequent encounters Purapura explains that Makoto will really die this time after his six months expire. However, when he befriends Saotome, a boy in his class who accepts outcasts such as him and treats them as equals, Makoto sees the joy in life for the first time. They spend some time together and they even begin studying for their high school entrance exam, something for which neither of them had any ambition before.
Knowing that his brother will never get accepted to a public high school due to his failing grades and lack of interest, Mitsuru announces that he will postpone his college entrance exams in order to allow his parents to save some money so they can send Makoto to a private school. Makoto refuses and tells his parents and brother that he has already chosen Tamegawa High (a public school he and Saotome agreed on earlier). An aggravated Mitsuru is unable to comprehend his unwillingness to accept his family's help and asks him if he enjoys tormenting his own family. Makoto breaks in tears and says that he just wanted to go to the same school his only friend is going to apply which leads to his parents accepting his wish. With his deadline reaching its end, Makoto meets with Purapura for one last time. He announces that he has found out what his former life's mistake was. He reveals that the soul was Makoto to begin with and that the mistake was his suicide. Purapura tells him that he will keep on living, but that he will also erase his memories of Purapura and the spirit world in order to make Makoto not think that he has any more chances. Before wiping his memories, Purapura advises him to live a colorful life."

In 2199, five years after the Gamilas launch attacks on Earth, the planet has been ravaged by the aliens' radiation bombs and the remnants of humanity have moved underground. One day, former pilot Susumu Kodai discovers a message capsule sent from the planet Iskandar that tells of a device that can remove the radiation from the Earth's surface. The United Nations of Space Administration rebuilds the battleship Yamato, with a new type of propulsion system - the Wave Motion Engine.

The Gamilas attack at every turn, but fallen hero Susumu Kodai and ace pilot Yuki Moro fight side by side for the future of their world. Together, these young lovers unlock the secrets of Iskandar - only to face a harrowing voyage that will change their world forever!—Funimation In 2199, after five years of attacks by an alien race known as the Gamilas which rendered the surface of the Earth uninhabitable and forcing humanity to evacuate underground, the Earth Defense Force launches a counter-attack near Mars. The fleet's weapons are no match for the Gamilas, who easily wipe out much of the defense force. During the battle, Captain Mamoru Kodai uses his damaged ship, the destroyer Yukikaze, as a shield to cover Captain Juzo Okita's battleship allowing his escape. Mamoru's ship is destroyed.On Earth, Mamoru's brother Susumu is scavenging on the irradiated surface near the half-buried wreckage of the battleship Yamato, when an object hits near him and knocks him unconscious. He awakens to find an alien message capsule, and notices that the radiation has been reduced to safe levels around him. He is rescued by Okita's returning ship and it is discovered that the capsule contains engineering schematics for a new warp drive and coordinates for the planet from which it came (Iskandar). After learning what happened at Mars, Susumu accuses Okita of using his brother as a living shield and tries to hit him, but crew member Yuki Mori violently stops him.The radiation that covers the Earth's surface is slowly sinking into the ground, scientists predict that the human race will become extinct in one year. Okita believes the hope for humanity lies within Iskandar. A request for volunteers for the mission is sent out, saying that Iskandar possesses a device that can remove the effects of the radiation. Kodai - a former EDF aviator - decides to reenlist. Their last battleship, the long-dead Yamato, is rebuilt and enhanced with alien technology. Before the Yamato can launch, the Gamilas attack with a gigantic missile. Captain Okita gives the order to fire the yet-untested Wave Motion Cannon, which successfully destroys the incoming missile. Kodai is reunited with his old fighter squadron. Yuki, who joined the EDF years ago on account of her admiration for Kodai, is bitter towards him.The Yamato crew performs their first warp test and encounters more Gamilas warships. Since the Wave Motion Cannon is powered by the same reactor as the warp drive, the crew has to wait until the engine is recharged before they can warp again. The Yamato destroys the alien capitol ships, but the battle damages Yuki's fighter. Kodai launches to rescue her and is sent to the brig for disobeying orders. Kodai's former squadmate and the acting navigator, Daisuke Shima, informs Yuki that Kodai left the service because he accidentally caused the deaths of his own parents and also nearly Shima's pregnant wife during a mission.After warping out of the Milky Way galaxy, the Yamato crew finds a Gamilas fighter adrift and recovers it to study. At the same time, Captain Okita goes into cardiac arrest and is revealed to have a terminal disease. However, the alien pilot is still alive and possesses Space Commando leader Hajime Saito, in order to communicate. The alien calls himself Desslar and says the Gamilas are a race with a hive mind. Kodai stuns the possessed Saito and the alien apparently is destroyed.Later, an ailing Captain Okita makes Kodai the acting-captain. He also reveals that the capsule contained only the plans for the Wave Motion Engine and the coordinates to Iskandar, and the idea that the device was made to give humanity hope. The crew discovers the captured Gamilas fighter contains a homing beacon, giving away their position. The Yamato fires her Wave Motion Cannon to destroy a Gamilas warship, but a Gamilas spacecraft latches onto the ship's occupied third bridge on the bottom of the hull and begins a self-destruct sequence. Kodai reluctantly orders Yuki, in her fighter, to blast the third bridge support away moments before it detonates, saving the Yamato but killing several crew. Kodai apologizes to Yuki for ordering her to doom their crewmates, and they comfort each other in romantic passion as the ship warps again.The Yamato arrives at Iskandar, but is met by a massive Gamilas fleet that sends a spacecraft to obstruct the muzzle of the Wave Motion Cannon. With their main weapon disabled, Kodai makes the dangerous choice to conduct a random warp and ends up on the opposite side of Iskandar. They are surprised to see that it is lifeless, and in fact strongly resembles Earth in its presently irradiated state. It is then discovered that Gamilas and Iskandar are the same planet. The crew thinks it is a trap, but Kodai urges them to go ahead. He leads an attack party on the planet's surface against heavy Gamilas opposition. Much of the assault force is killed, and the remaining pilots remain behind to cover for Kodai, Sanada, Saito and Mori as they head for the coordinates.Once they reach the coordinates, an alien possesses Yuki's body and explains that Gamilas and Iskandar are two aspects of the same race. The alien says their planet is dying and they saw Earth as the most suitable replacement, after first destroying humanity. Iskandar did not agree with this and was imprisoned, she implants Yuki the ability to clean the radiation from Earth. As Yuki and Kodai return to the Yamato, Saito and Sanada sacrifice themselves by destroying the Gamilas power source, destroying most of the Gamilas forces. The Yamato returns to Earth and Okita dies. The crew rejoices their return home, but a surviving Gamilas warship ambushes them and severely damages the battleship.Desslar now appears and says they no longer wish to invade the Earth; however, since the majority of the Gamilas were killed, he intends to destroy the planet with his ship to avenge his race. Kodai orders the surviving crew to abandon ship before he pilots the Yamato on a kamikaze attack against Desslar's ship. He fires the Wave Motion Cannon which vaporizes both spaceships. Several years later, the Earth's surface has been restored to its original state and Yuki is seen with her child (possibly Kodai's child)."

When Matt's boss grows suspicious of new hire Kristi, a ""Santa Writer"" whose job is responding to letters addressed to the North Pole, she recruits him to spy on her and report back with any unusual findings. But the more time Matt spends observing Kristi, the harder he starts to fall for her until he's hopelessly in love.

""Corporate"" sends her to a different postal outlet every year, corporate in fact being her father, Santa Claus, and not the postal service as her coworkers believe. Since becoming an adult, Kristi has been looking for a place that she could truly call home. The outlet that she is working at this year in Del Vista, California is managed by egotistical Richard Fuller, who has no Christmas spirit whatsoever and does not allow any Christmas adornments in the outlet. Believing Kristi to be a corporate spy somehow trying to catch him in a mistake to thwart what he believes is an imminent promotion, Fuller enlists the assistance of carrier Matt Sanders as assistant manager, his primary job responsibility to spy back on Kristi. Matt reluctantly takes the job solely because he needs the money as a single man taking care of an eight year old child, his orphaned niece Emily. Matt gave up his life in a band where he was living and took the carrier job to take care of Emily in her own home not to add to her upheaval, and as such has focused all his energies on taking care of her at the expense of his own life. Emily's Christmas wish, which she writes to Santa about, is wanting her Uncle Matt to be happy, in part by finding someone with who to fall in love. Santa's response, via Kristi, who is unaware that Emily's Matt is the same as Matt her coworker, leads to Emily trying to act as matchmaker. In the meantime, Matt tries to do his job by getting closer to Kristi. In the process, Matt and Kristi start to fall for each other, Kristi for the first time in her life.

Rudy grabs the envelope and Matt and Kristi meet as Matt must retrieve the envelope. Kristi has to do it and she puts it in Matt's mouth.At the mail processing facility, Matt is not working hard enough and gets criticized by demanding boss Richard Fuller, who thinks anything related to Christmas is nothing more than a distraction.

It is Kristi who responds to all the letters, claiming to be Santa Claus. Sally is one of the employees who delivers some of the letters, and she becomes friendly with Kristi.

He does point out that Matt and Kristi are not allowed to have a romantic relationship, but he asks Matt to take a tiny recording device to find out what he can about Kristi. Matt refuses to do that, and Fuller uses the device to record Matt saying he doesn't have feelings for Kristi. Still, Matt's job is on the line.

Matt tells her Heather was just an old friend, and Emily is the daughter of his late sister. Kristi comes over to Matt's house and helps make cookies, with natural sprinkles. Then Matt gets out his guitar and plays loud rock music while Heather sings. It is not explained why the audience can also hear drums.Fuller has finally had enough. Not only are letters to Santa slowing down his operation, but emails to Santa, which for some reason go through the Postal Service servers, are also slowing down computers. Letters to Santa will now go to the dead letter office, and Kristi has to go. Sally tells the Postmaster General what is going on.Kristi hears that Matt was just trying to get information out of her, and she assumes that means Matt didn't care about her. Kristi leaves the building very hurt, and just in case anything Matt could say will change her mind, Fuller plays that recording of him saying he doesn't have feelings for her. Fuller also tells Matt he is delivering mail once again.Kristi calls her Dad and says she's coming home for Christmas.Matt finds out his band got a record deal, and he sees no reason to keep his postal job, so he's joining the band on tour.

A man resembling Santa Claus, in a mailman's uniform, hands him an important letter.Fuller is asked to come to his office. Matt is dressed like a rock star with his feet on the desk, which angers Fuller. Matt informs him what has happened and says this is no longer his office, and Sally tells Fuller about his new position. Sally, who has Fuller's old job, is later shown working from Kristi's old office. Fuller now washes trucks.Matt is ready to leave with Heather and Emily, but he wants to pick up Kristi too. But Kristi has left her apartment. All she had was Rudy and the suitcase. So Matt, Heather and Emily leave.Kristi is still in the neighborhood, walking with Rudy and the suitcase, when she is picked up by that same mailman who delivered the special letter to Matt. Sally gives Kristi a ride, and Kristi figures out how to find Matt. She just lets the most elaborate Christmas decorations on people's houses point the way, and it works. Kristi and Matt are reunited and Kristi will travel with him and the band. But she has one last phone call to make. As she tells her father she can't come home, ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" is heard from her phone."

While differences crop up between investigative tactics of the two agents, upper Caste Hindus, aided by the police, target the fearful Dalits and lower-caste Hindus, brutally torturing them and setting their houses on fire. With the entire local community refusing to come forward with any information, and pressure from the Chief CBI Chief to withdraw, the duo must now consider using other methods to try and find out what really happened to the three students.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) It's supposedly based on a true story which is yet to be substantiated. Three friends from Delhi go missing in a small village - Jhanjhar. It's two months and there is no clue about their disappearance. The media and students movement demand action from the authorities. It's then that the government orders a CBI inquiry with officers Sidhant Chaturvedi (Akshaye Khanna) and Pratap Kumar (Ajay Devgn) to solve the case. They find it difficult to solve the case as the local police and other authorities are a part of Shool Sena, which is responsible for illicit activities. Sidhant and Pratap also face Ajatshatru Singh (Paresh Rawal), a ruthless police officer who misuses his power & thwarts the investigation at every step. Not only that even the locals don't support the investigation.

Roshni's SIM was found in the car that was recovered. Sidhant has to call police force from Delhi to arrest Roshni, when Omkar refuses to hand her over.Geeta was the daughter of Pratap's teacher & both fell in love.

Ajatshatru had brought the 3 boys back home where first Omkar kills Dinu & then Ajatshatru kills the 2 friends as they were sons of powerful people in Delhi who would have revealed everything if they escaped. Geeta witnessed this from behind a door. CBI finds the bodies based on her testimony.Ajatshatru comes to know about her wife Geeta helping CBI. He then beats Geeta brutally with his belt behind closed doors and leaves her hospitalized. Pratap, filled with anger, traps each of the criminals by hacking their respective phone's databases and capturing their illicit activities on CCTV cameras. When it is Ajatshatru's turn, Pratap cuts him with a sharp razor and beats him brutally and mercilessly in a saloon behind closed doors. They also entice one of the henchmen to become their witness by convincing Shool Sena that he is already working for them. Shool Sena attacks the henchman & drives him straight to Pratap

Based on the book by famous sport journalist, Vladimir Stankovic, dramatized by renowned screenplay writers Srdjan Dragojevic and Ranko Bozic under the first-time director's palette of actor Dragan Bjelogrlic, this historical melodrama gives us an unique and somewhat nostalgic view into the 1930's of Belgrade and resurrects the old times reminding us of a quite distinctive era when values and virtues were something very different from what they are today. Thanks to the production teams of Intermedia Network, the epoch comes to life and at times we feel hypnotized by the magic of the cobblestone streets of Cubura, audiences sense the hype of using electricity, birth of the radio and the growing trend of cabaret nightclubs and Ford T model cars just like the one owned by then soccer star, Blagoje Mosa Marjanovic (Petar Strugar). This show introduces us to a whole new generation of young actors (Milos Bikovic, Viktor Savic, Aleksandar Radojicic, Nenad Herakovic, Uros Jovcic, Nenad Herakovic, Milan Nikitovic, Rade Cosic, Bojan Krivokapic and Aleksandar Filimonovic) who play the roles of almost forgotten historical figures, soccer gods, players of the then most popular and valiant clubs, BSK and Yugoslavia and a very extraordinary goalie from the less recognized Soko Club (Andrija Kuzmanovic). Other roles were cast out to the very best of Serbian cinematography such as Srdjan Todorovic, Slobodan Boda Ninkovic, Nikola Djuricko, Vojin Cetkovic, Branimir Brstina, Mima Karadzic, Marko Zivic, Sergej Trifunovic, Marko Nikolic, Anita Mancic, Branka Pujic and others, just to name a few. The subject of soccer seems to take lead but very soon we see that love, heroism, companionship, faith, honor, patriotism and respect are actually the main characters. Throughout the episodes, the inhabitants of Belgrade are introduced to us via their individual and almost quirky personalities, aspirations and head-strong ambitions, innovations that were then considered to be ludicrous and the constantly present ideal of an almost impossible trip to the first FIFA World Cup in a place that seems to be at the end of the globe, far away Montevideo, Uruguay.—Intermedia Network staff Belgrade, spring of 1930Tirke is a boy from Cubura that is forced to choose between a factory job and football. After a series of tough decisions, he stays faithful to his true love - football. Back in the days, you couldn't earn a living by playing football - but you could live for football.

Garrick drives away in his car.The movie then cuts to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, where we meet our main character, Sarah, who has been sober for three months. Another fellow alcoholic, Kevin, invites her to dinner to celebrate. She offers instead to meet him for lunch on Thursday.During their date, Sarah is shy and timid. The fact that there are wine bottles along a wall near the restaurant's entrance has them both a little awkward.Garrick is being moved to another prison. He offers no resistance and stares into space. A loose screw rolls around on the floor of the police car.Sarah is at work in a dental office where she works as a hygienist. Her co-worker asks her about her date, and encourages her not to write it off just yet, even though she doesn't feel ready to go any further.Garrick arrives at a rest stop with public showers. He showers, washes his hair, and shaves off his beard. Flashbacks show his escape from the police car, and an officer with his throat ripped wide open. That night, at a motel, his TV plays a news report about a nationwide manhunt for him.

The memories leave her unable to sleep, and she teeters dangerously close to drowning her sorrows in more alcohol before regaining control and flushing the bottle's contents down her toilet.Garrick drives down the road at twilight, listening to a radio news report on the manhunt for him. He's been at large for seven days now, and the FBI is coordinating with all local agencies, setting up checkpoints at both the Canadian and Mexican borders.At an AA meeting Sarah listens to another woman tell a story about herself. The meeting leader asks Sarah about confronting her own alcoholism, and she trips over her words a number of times, only able to say that she was in a bad relationship and came to understand that her alcoholism was tied to it.As Sarah enters her car, Kevin is there, impressed at how she's starting to open up about herself. He assures her that like her, everyone there has more to tell, but just aren't ready yet. He'd very much like to hear her stories, but only when she's comfortable with them. Sarah suddenly invites Kevin over to her house for tea. Tea leads to kissing, which leads to them starting to have sex, but ultimately Kevin can't go through with it. Sarah gently tells him it's okay.We see another flashback: Garrick is forcing the woman he'd been tailing to drive him through a police checkpoint. He quietly explains step by step how she can get through without any suspicion. After they're through, the woman begs tearfully for her life, saying her family expected her home a half hour ago. Of course, Garrick ends up killing her. We see him get out of the car, holding the knife, slumping near the left front wheel of the car, and the camera pans to show the woman sitting behind the wheel, the window dotted with blood.The memory flashback shows Sarah waking up at the sound of Garrick leaving in the middle of the night to go for a walk.In the waking world, Sarah wakes up and greets Kevin, who's spent the night.

Seeing the newspaper stand showing an article about the manhunt for him, Garrick stands in front of the stand as the man rambles about nearby power lines having transponders, and now that the country has a black president, he's using them to spy on people. The man advises Garrick swapping his car, which has a plastic roof, for one with a steel roof, which the transponders can't read through. Garrick politely listens and accommodates the man, before going to his car and driving off.At breakfast, two of Kevin's friends find him at the counter with Sarah. Rusty does all the talking, while Reed is quiet. Kevin used to drink with them before joining AA. Rusty and Reed only stay long enough for coffee before heading out to give Kevin time alone with Sarah.Another memory flashback shows Garrick again leaving Sarah's house in the middle of the night. This time Sarah gets up and follows him.Sarah comes in to work to find that her co-worker, Carla, hasn't shown up. Sarah steps outside and calls her, leaving a message on Carla's voice mail.Garrick enters a bar/grill and buys a meal. As he eats, radio news continues to talk about the search for him, asking for any information not only on leads to his whereabouts, but about anyone who might be suspected of aiding and sheltering him. Internet fan sites abound, and a Facebook page for his fans numbers in the hundreds of thousands.Two men are leaving the bar/grill when one says he left something inside. Garrick, suspecting the man may have recognized him, feigns illness and ambushes and murders both of them.Sarah goes to Carla's house and knocks on her door, but there is no answer. She sees Carla's landlord, Mr. Harper, working his yard and asks about her. The landlord says he last saw Carla two days before. She gives him her name and asks him to have Carla call her if he sees Carla again.Sarah meets Kevin for lunch. She tells Kevin that Carla didn't show up for work and didn't answer her doorbell. Kevin offers to bring her to the police after their AA meeting, but Sarah, feeling timid again, tries to assure herself that Carla is okay.At the meeting, a man named Warner talks about the two young men who were killed. He was acquainted with them and sometimes drank with them, and the murder has shaken him, making him think he could have been with them and also gotten killed. One of the young men was also a meth cooker, and Warner thinks the killing might have been drug related.Mr. Harper knocks on Carla's door, concerned for her. He goes around to the back and lets himself in with his spare key, calling out to her. He finds Carla's body lain on the sofa, covered in dried blood.Garrick is seen watching outside the orthodontics office where Sarah works. Sarah hurries out of the office in tears after having learned of Carla's murder.Kevin hurries to Sarah's house, running to hold and comfort her after having gotten her frantic call. Unable to control her fear, Sarah is only able to tell Kevin some of the story, that she knows that her ex-boyfriend killed Carla as a warning to Sarah that he's found her and is coming after her now. Sarah is also afraid that her ex will now kill Kevin, too, for being involved with her. Kevin tells her that his parents have a cabin in a secluded area where he can take her, and they'll be safe.A memory flashback shows Sarah driving up to a public storage facility. She clips the lock for one locker with heavy bolt cutters and goes inside. She finds a large meat hook hanging from the ceiling and an electric drill. Clipping a heavy chain holding a large container closed, she finds the butchered body of a woman. Police race to the scene and ask Sarah about the owner of the locker. Even as she gives them Garrick's work address, she tries to tell herself and the officers that he wasn't responsible for murdering the woman.As Kevin drives to the cabin, Sarah is telling him her story. Kevin says he'd read about everything in the papers, and had heard of Garrick. Sarah's name and likeness, however, were never published as part of a deal in return for her testimony. They arrive at the cabin and Kevin opens the gate, saying they have to walk the rest of the way.Playing cards at the table are Rusty and Reed. Kevin confronts them, wanting to know what the hell they're doing there. Rusty says he's tired of waiting and wants to get down to business. Kevin suddenly turns-- and lays into Sarah with a wicked left fist to her jaw, knocking her unconscious.A memory flashback shows Garrick and Sarah in bed. Garrick suddenly asks Sarah how she would choose to die if she knew her death was imminent, but she could choose how it happened. Sounding not quite sober, Sarah says she'd take a morphine overdose. Garrick, on the other hand, thinks he would do something more hardcore, like a kamikaze pilot.Sarah awakens in the cabin; she's tied up and suspended upside down from the ceiling. Kevin, Rusty and Reed watch over her. They reveal that Reed, not Garrick, was Carla's murderer. Sarah's fate appears very bleak as they further reveal that Kevin hero-worships Garrick, and the three of them had spent a great deal of time tracking down the woman who put him behind bars, Kevin posing as a recovering alcoholic to get close to her, and finally they have her as their prisoner, to have their way with her and bring her to a grisly end the way Garrick would have and should have. They say the best place to start is to break Sarah's feet, because if she can't walk, she can't run or escape, and this would break her spirit. Reed and Rusty tightly cover Sarah's mouth to quiet her terrified screams and sobs as they start to torture her.The dark ritual is interrupted by a knock at the door. How anyone else even knew about the cabin, let alone were able to find it, is a mystery. Kevin seems to know, however. He answers the door and Garrick walks in. Kevin had sent Garrick letters of admiration, including a code that helped him find where Sarah had escaped to, and how to find the cabin.But suddenly Garrick asks what they're doing to Sarah, and when they say they're finishing his work, finishing off the woman who put him away, Garrick reveals that he didn't break out of prison to finish Sarah off, but to save her from Kevin and his cohorts. Until then, he says, he was actually very content in prison and in solitary, because he couldn't hurt anyone else there-- especially Sarah. He doesn't blame Sarah for putting him away; in fact he believes that she saved not only many others who he might have killed, but also saved Garrick from himself. The only reason Garrick escaped from prison and killed again, was because of the letters Kevin sent him about the plans to finish Sarah off... so that Garrick could save her.As Garrick speaks, he stealthily pulls a hidden knife. Making further small talk as a distraction, he buries the knife in Rusty's temple, grabs his gun and shoots Reed. Kevin, however, gets the drop on him, and stabs him with another long knife. Garrick is gravely wounded, but alive, and as Kevin tries to apologize, calling Garrick his hero, Garrick shoots and kills him.Sarah tearfully begs Garrick to untie her. Her pleas make it seem that a part of her still loves Garrick even now. Despite how gravely wounded he is, Garrick is able to untie Sarah and undo the rigging suspending her from the cabin ceiling. As he gently lowers her to the ground, he starts to succumb to his wounds. After a brief flashback with some recollections of Sarah and Garrick as a couple, Sarah stands up and exits the cabin without comforting him or showing him any gratitude. Garrick falls down to the ground and quietly dies alone.The movie ends as Sarah stumbles out of the cabin, back toward Kevin's car, to return to civilization."

Dear Mr. Gacy,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371117/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A chronicle of the interaction between college student Jason Moss and the object of his obsession, serial killer John Wayne Gacy. 1993. Overachieving college studentJason Moss, fascinated by serial crime, decides to write his criminology class term paper onJohn Wayne Gacy, who is on death row and scheduled to be executed in six months time. Jason's criminology professor, Mr. Harris, will only allow Jason to write his paper on Gacy if Jason can come up with a fresh angle, as he himself believes the topic of serial killers is already overexposed. After writing Gacy a nondescript letter and receiving a questionnaire from Gacy in return, Jason believes the fresh angle would be truly to get inside Gacy's head, specifically to learn what makes him tick, by presenting himself in subsequent correspondence to Gacy as Gacy's ""type"", i.e. a vulnerable young man from a dysfunctional family and thus who is possibly at risk. Despite the advice that he needs to watch out for cunning Gacy, Jason is certain he can outsmart the serial criminal at his own game. Things take an unexpected turn for Jason when he starts receiving telephone calls from Gacy, who was able to find out his number. As Jason feels he has to do further field work based on things that Gacy wants him to report back on, Jason may find that he is not as well equipped emotionally to handle the situation than he first believed, potentially leading to serious consequences both for himself and those around him.—Huggo Illinois, 1994. As part of his college thesis, 18-year-old Jason Moss (Jesse Moss) decides to write to serial killers and attempt to gain their trust through impersonating a typical victim or admirer. He reasoned that gaining their trust, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.He sends a carefully crafted letter to John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe) in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable boy. The film unfolds as Gacy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through intense emotional tests via letters and collect calls, and an eventual face-to-face visit in prison.The story opens with Moss's fascination in Gacy's case as Gacy, having spent 14 years on death row, awaits the court's decision regarding his final appeal. Moss, an apt criminology student, forms a plan to ""get inside the head"" of Gacy, hoping to uncover new information regarding Gacy's murders and write a standout term paper on Gacy in the process.He sends Gacy his first letter, and is at first untruthful, telling him he has no girlfriend and a bad relationship with his supposedly controlling and abusive parents. He also states that his little brother, who is being bullied at school, sees him as a hero and would do anything for him. Gacy's first response is to send a questionnaire regarding Moss's personal and sex life. Moss, seeing an interview in which Gacy admits to engaging in sodomy, adopts a different tact. He begins working out, taking pictures of himself posing topless, and portraying himself as increasingly vulnerable and lonely in his letters. He informs Gacy that he has considered hustling or nude dancing in order to earn extra money. Gacy, beginning to open up, acts understanding and supportive in his letters, encouraging Moss to take up hustling and even giving him advice on technique and safety precautions, asking Moss to ""tell me all about it... don't hold back.""Moss, not wanting to lose the connection he has made with Gacy, but unwilling to go quite so far as to sell himself on the street, improvises. He pays a male prostitute to be interviewed so as to provide Gacy with the information he wants. The hustler takes him to a bar, buys him a drink and answers several of his questions before telling Moss to follow him. Standing up, Moss realizes he has been drugged. Fleeing the bar, he manages to get to his car before falling unconscious.The next day, Gacy calls, asking how it went. Moss tells him he was approached by a buyer who drugged him before attempting to rape him. Gacy reacts angrily, offering to have the man taken care of. He tells Moss that he is very protective of the people he is close to.Over the next few days, Moss and Gacy correspond via phone. Gacy sends him money, shares his beliefs on power and control, and tells Moss that he is his only friend, and that he and Moss ""are more alike than you know"". Upon Moss's sharing his brother's bullying problem with Gacy, Gacy advises him to physically deal with the bully, and encourages him to commit incest with his brother. Moss, visibly shaken and disgusted by this, hangs up and ignores Gacy's calls for several days. When Moss finally answers Gacy's insistent nightly calls, Gacy is furious with him, advising him to ""remember who I am"" and even goes so far as to threaten to send people to his house.The next few days see Moss's performance in class and his relationship with his girlfriend rapidly deteriorating. He becomes paranoid, arming himself with his father's pistol when at home, and loses control when he sees his brother being bullied, badly beating the bully. He refuses to go with his family to visit his grandmother and remains at home alone, on edge and drinking heavily. When the doorbell rings late at night, he answers the door with the gun, only to find it is his girlfriend. They are interrupted by a call from a distraught Gacy, who tearfully informs Moss that his appeal has been turned down and he is to be executed in six days. Moss's girlfriend reacts furiously to Moss's accepting the call, as does Gacy upon hearing her voice in the background. She leaves and Gacy hangs up. Moss, on the point of losing control, goes out and rents a prostitute, taking the woman to a motel. He forces her onto her stomach, attempts to restrain her when she protests, nearly suffocating her, then leaves.Gacy calls him again, acting sympathetic and apologetic, and invites Moss to come meet him in person before he dies. Moss, while considering this, contacts one of Gacy's victims, who escaped by jumping from a car. His harrowing story is told in a flashback where Gacy taunts him, rapes him and tortures him before he escapes.Moss ultimately accepts Gacy's invitation, travelling to the prison where they finally meet face to face. The guards, with whom Gacy has formed a friendship, photograph them together at Gacy's request, then leave them alone. They are amicable at first, eating and joking together, Gacy showing him letters and requests he has received, and also shows him his case file. Upon Moss asking him about his first murder, however, Gacy becomes hostile and aggressive, telling him how much power he has over Moss and how easy it would be to kill him. He becomes more and more physical, starting with flirtatious contact and eventually threatening to rape and kill Moss. Moss fights back, abusing Gacy physically and verbally before the guards pull him off. Gacy appears delighted by this, reminding him forcibly once again that they are alike.Moss, traumatized, goes home and reunites with his concerned parents. When Gacy calls again, he tells Gacy that he was ""playing him from the start"", and informs him of his college thesis, telling him that he was only ever an experiment. Gacy hangs up silently and prepares to die.Moss does not watch the news report on Gacy's execution, and becomes withdrawn and reticent. Several days later, he receives a final letter from Gacy, telling him that although he was indeed fooled by Moss's letters, it has proved to him irrevocably that they are very alike, and ends with ""it's time to die now. See you on the other side, buddy"".The film ends with a real-life interview with the real Jason Moss, and shows the real photo taken of Moss and Gacy several days before the execution, stating that Moss went on to graduate and write a book on his relationship with Gacy before taking his own life in June 2006."

The movie opens with Bittoo collecting money from others to gatecrash a wedding for tasty food. Intelligent and quirky, Shruti Kakkar (Anushka Sharma), who assists the wedding coordinator, suspects that he is from neither the groom nor bride's side and is just stealing food. Bittoo's friend, the Videographer at the wedding, pretends that Bittoo is part of the film crew and has a right to be there. After watching her dance at the wedding, Bittoo makes a video of her during the dance routine. The next day he figures out her name and college and chases her down to give her the DVD to impress her. She accepts it and tells him her dream of opening a wedding-planning company.After exams are over Shruti makes a deal with her parents that she has five years to get her business up and running before they arrange a marriage for her. When Bittoo's father comes to take him back to his village to work chopping sugar cane, Bittoo refuses and lies that he and Shruti are going into business together. He goes to Shruti with this idea but she refuses because she was worried that a romantic complication would rise between the two of them. She tells Bittoo that the number one rule of business is not to let love get in the way. Bittoo promises that that will never be a problem. Shruti still refuses but Bittoo follows her around anyways.Shruti goes to meet with Chanda, a famous wedding planner, in the hopes that Chanda will hire her and teach her about ""high-class weddings."" However, too over-eager, Shruti ruins her chance at getting hired and is just about to be thrown out when Chanda sees Bittoo waiting for her. Needing a strong person for heavy lifting, Chanda offers him a job. Bittoo accepts with the condition that she hires Shruti as well, saying that they are partners and refusing to work without her. Chanda agrees and the two of them get to work helping with the wedding. While checking the arrangements, Shruti learns that Chanda is cheating her clients - she orders a cheaper arrangement of flowers and decorations than the family requested so she can keep more of the commission. Later that day, when the irate father of the bride confronts Chanda, she blames Shruti, claiming it was her fault that the flowers hadn't been ordered correctly. Bittoo, angry at Chanda for accusing Shruti, yells back that she has no right to treat her employees like this.He tells her they quit and Shruti, calling him her partner, leaves with him, warning Chanda that they'll ""see her around the market.""
The two then begin their own company ""Shaadi Mubarak"" (Happy Weddings), and with the work equally split between the two, their enterprise becomes a success. Their first project is low-budget but very successful. The flamboyant duo then go on to plan many more small weddings, working incredibly well as a team. finally, they migrate to posh colonies of Delhi and get their first big client by stealing them away from Chanda. After working night and day, the wedding is a huge success. That night, after the event, they dance to celebrate and both end up slightly drunk. A simple hug turns into more, and the two make love that night. Afterwards, Bittoo lies awake all night, worried about what had happened.In the morning, Bittoo pretends to be asleep while Shruti wakes and dresses. When Shruti starts calling him ""dear"" he is obviously uncomfortable with it. Not wanting to hurt her feelings, Bittoo behaves awkwardly around her over the next few days, while Shruti realizes that she has fallen in love with him. Knowing that he is worried about what happened, Shruti tries to reassure Bitto that she's not like other women he's been with who follow him around everywhere. Bittoo, misunderstanding, believes that she's telling him that the night didn't mean anything to her. Relieved, he tells her it meant nothing to him as well, citing her own rule that business and love don't mix. Shruti pretends to agree but cries after he leaves. This creates a tense atmosphere between the two, eventually leading to Shruti making a mistake with the sound board at a wedding. They have a huge fight resulting in Shruti breaking the partnership and forcing Bittoo to leave the company. Bittoo vows to start his own wedding planning business and the two go their separate ways. Both of them attempt to prove themselves in the industry while badmouthing the other's business to clients. However, they don't do as well by themselves, unable to handle the workload without their partner and both enterprises end up suffering huge losses, plunging them into debt.Shruti is forced into a situation of even sharing bed with men if she failed to pay.They finally get a big contract, but it is contingent upon them working together as a team. The bride had been a guest at the first big wedding they'd done and wanted the same level for her own wedding. Facing debt collectors, they agree to partner up again for this one wedding for the sake of recovering their own losses. They divvy up the workload and each focus on their own departments, eventually falling back into their old rhythm. When the lead entertainer is forced to back out at the last minute due to suffering an injury, Bittoo and Shruti perform together for the wedding, something they hadn't done since before their falling out. The performance is a success and the next day, Bittoo tells Shruti that they should be partners again, saying that Shaadi Mubarak was never as successful as when they were together. Shruti refuses his offer, telling him that she is getting married in two months to her fiance, Chetan, and will move to Dubai with him after the wedding. Bittoo is stunned and immediately argues with her that she can't get married, saying it it is ""totally wrong.""During the rest of the wedding preparations Bittoo pesters Shruti about her engagement, claiming that she'd be moving too far from her mother and father, or that Dubai wouldn't suit her. When none of those reason dissuade her, Bittoo asks if her engagement was an attempt to make him jealous, claiming that she'd fallen in love with him and that this marriage was a way to get revenge because he paid her no heed after their night together. Shruti refuses to answer. He finally goes too far when he cuts off a call from Chetan in a effort to get Shruti to answer his question. Livid, Shruti answers that she is not doing it for revenge, but for her own security and her parents' satisfaction to see her well-settled in life. She admits that she did fall in love with Bittoo, but since he didn't feel the same, she had moved on. Shruti answers a call from Chetan and walks away sadly, leaving Bittoo alone.At the sudden thought of losing her forever, Bittoo realizes that he has always been in love with Shruti, but was too scared to acknowledge it in fear of jeopardizing the business. Desperate to win her back, Bittoo steals Chetan's phone number from Shruti's cell and calls him, telling him to back off and that Shruti was his. Hearing what Bittoo had done from Cheten, Shruti angrily runs off to find Bittoo and confronts him where he is waiting for her on a rooftop. Bittoo tells Shruti that he'd loved her all along and was a fool to have run away from her love. Shruti calls off her engagement and the two share a passionate kiss.
The film ends with both of them dancing at their own wedding, their friends and family celebrating with them."

The film opens at a swim meet. Chung Taeyeon and her best friend Yoon Narae are both competing, with Lee Sehee in the stands cheering them on. Taeyeon comes in first with Narae in third place. While both swimmers have pictures taken of them, Taeyeon calls Sehee out from the crowd and gets her to pose with them for a picture. The scene shifts to two years later. At the pool, a member of the swim team, Kyunghee, goes for a practice swim in the
pool but is suddenly dragged underwater by a mysterious black smoke. Kyunghee struggles, but then spots a corpse-like figure staring back at her and screams.The school is in the middle of final exams. Narae, tired of studying, makes no real attempt at the test. Sehee gets a severe nose bleed; the teaching assistant, Miss Park, tries to let her go to the nurse, but the teacher, Mr. Cha, refuses to let her go. After the test, Narae watches the swim team practice before getting up and leaving. She has quit the team. The coach tells Narae to study hard in order to get into a good college now that she doesn't have
swimming to fall back on. Above the swimming pool a male student, Wonho, takes pictures of the swim team in their bathing suits.Miss Park messes up during a class evaluation, causing the students to laugh. While she tries to teach, the students pass around a photograph of Miss Park and another teacher, edited to look like they were having sex. Just
as he gets hold of the picture, Kim Jangkook - known as JK among the students - is called on to read from the textbook. Miss Park demands that he hand over the picture, but becomes embarrassed when she sees what it is
and crumples it up.Yeom Jiyoon approaches Sehee and asks if she wants to rejoin her study group; Sehee says no. Kwanwoo, who has been handing out milk cartons to the students, tosses a carton at Jiyoon, who moves. The milk hits Sehee instead, exploding and drenching her. Mr. Cha enters just then, and the students return to their seats; as Kwanwoo passes Sehee's desk, he hands her a handkerchief to dry herself. Mr. Cha announces that the top thirty students in the school will be enrolled in a summer course and will still be at the school during summer break, starting tomorrow. It is shown that Narae has been enrolled in the program despite her ranking being lower than 30. Narae calls her mother and demands to know why she was put in this class, saying that she only wanted to quit swimming, not get involved with more studying. She accuses her mother of giving the school money - and not for the first time - in order to get her into the summer program.While Sehee packs for the summer course at home, Taeyeon sits at the piano behind her, teasing her for her intense study habits. She asks Sehee to play something for her on the piano. When Sehee finishes, Taeyeon
demonstrates that all she can play is ""Chopsticks""; while she plays, Sehee glances over to see that Taeyeon has become a rotting corse, complete with hollow eye sockets dripping with blood. Sehee screams, then wakes up from
where she had been sleeping at her desk. She turns behind her and sees the piano bench empty, but water droplets can be seen on a few of the keys.Before the summer program begins the next day, Sehee and Narae run into each other but don't speak. JK and Yongran, his girlfriend, speed by on JK's motorcycle. The rest of the students trickle in. Mr. Kang, the principal, tells the class that this course will be about competition for the highest ranking and to see the other students as rivals. Miss Park takes the cell phones from the students. Wonho hands her a small nude figurine wrapped in bondage along with his phone, but she ignores it. During lunch, Yongran reveals to Jiyoon that she plans to have sex with JK that night. Sehee is too absorbed in her flash cards to pay attention to Kwanwoo's apology for the milk incident. That evening, Miss Park and Mr. Cha are left to supervise the students by themselves, as Mr. Kang is leaving for personal matters; he assures them that the doors and gates will be locked and nothing could go wrong.In the dorm, Hyuna, another friend of Jiyoon, is putting up her numerous pill bottles when another girl, Minjung, tells her that Kyunghee saw the ghost of Chung Taeyeon in the swimming pool. Hyuna becomes upset and leaves, and Narae criticizes Minjung's sense of humor over someone's death. In the bathroom, Hyuna takes her pills and begins to hallucinate hair growing rapidly all over her body, then blood being dumped on her from the ceiling. The swimming coach goes to shower, but hears noise coming from the other room. The lights go off and the coach begins fumbling around; a sudden burst of light in her eyes makes her scream before she is thrown against the
wall and killed. Yongran sneaks through the halls to her meeting spot with JK. She is pinned to the wall by someone wearing a mask; it's only JK, who removes the mask before they begin to make out. Outside, Mr. Kang finishes
locking the gates and leaves just as the televisions and lights in the hallway begin to flicker.The students and Miss Park have all fallen asleep at their desks while studying. As the clock strikes midnight, the school bell plays and wakes the students. Sehee notices something written on the blackboard: ""When an innocent mother is killed, what son wouldn't avenge her?"" Hyuna wakes up to find blood dripping onto her forehead. Yongrans body suddenly breaks through the ceiling tiles, hanging from a rope. Foreign characters are sewn into her face. The PA system turns on and a male voice announces that students will die, and that the students must find the answer to who is killing them and why in order to leave the school alive. Yongran is suddenly dropped and dies on impact with the edge of a desk. The students, terrified, find that they are locked in. The televisions in the hallway turn on to show JK laying in the middle of a different school hallway, waking up from unconsciousness. A mysterious figure appears in the same hallway on his motorcycle proceeds to run JK over repeatedly until he is dead.Hyuna begins to panic and says that Taeyeon has come to kill everyone. Mr. Cha appears, and the students tell him that Yongran and JK are both dead. They beg him to let them out, but he tells them that Mr. Kang has the keys. He
tells Miss Park to take the students back to the classroom, and goes with Kwak Sooil to try to find a working telephone. Sooil tells Mr. Cha that the lines have been cut and that there is also no wireless signal.In the classroom, Hyuna takes more of her pills as some of the other girls discuss Taeyeon; it is revealed that Taeyeon committed suicide in the school swimming pool. A male student begins to get aggressive, accusing another student of being behind the killings and threatening to beat him up. Hyuna screams and hallucinates ants crawling all over her. She begins clawing at herself and even stabs herself with a pen to get rid of the ants. Jiyoon tries to stop her but ends up getting slashed in the face with the pen. Hyuna starts foaming at the mouth and coughing up blood; just as Jiyoon notices that the pills Hyuna had been taking were not her prescribed ones - meaning someone had switched her medication - Hyuna dies.Sehee repeats the riddle she saw on the board and Jiyoon comes up with an answer. The riddle references Queen Yoon, mother of King Yeonsan. Yoon was poisoned and killed. Mr. Cha and Sooil enter the classroom right then.
The same male student from earlier becomes aggressive again, accusing Mr. Cha of being involved in the murders. Angered, Mr. Cha punches the student, but before the student can return the blow the lights go out. Mr. Cha
gets a flashlight and asks for everyone to stay together and go to their dorms while he goes to the maintenance room with Miss Park and Sooil.In their dorm room, Sehee mentions to Narae that the photo of them with Taeyeon is still hanging in Taeyeon's bedroom; this is the first time she has spoken of Taeyeon since her suicide. Minjung, confused, asked if Sehee lived with Taeyeon. The scene changes to a flashback of a miserable Sehee and her father sitting in a restaurant, where Sehee is meeting her father's new fiancee for the first time. When she arrives, she has her daughter with her:
Taeyeon. Taeyeon mentions that she's excited to be in the same class as Sehee the next semester; Sehee responds that she hopes no one finds out that they will be step-sisters. In the present time Sehee begins to cry, saying that she feels guilty for the nasty way she treated Taeyeon. Narae says she was angry that she was never told that Sehee and Taeyeon were step-sisters. Sehee apologizes to Narae, ""even though it's too late.""Kyunghee is out in the hallway, banging on a dorm room door and begging for someone to let her in. After a few minutes, Wonho opens his door and invites her in. In his room are several figurines like the one he gave to Miss Park, of nude women in bondage. Wonho asks if Kyunghee remembers when, a year before, she sat next to him and shared her lunch with him during a school trip. He then asks if she wants a blanket but Kyunghee, clearly
uncomfortable, says no and leaves. Wonho follows her out into the hallway, begging her to stay with him. Around this time, some of the male students break into one of the classrooms and grab a box of spray paint cans.In the maintenance room, Mr. Cha connects two wires and turns the power back on. A generator comes on as well, which turns on a weapon that kills Sooil. Mr. Cha and Miss Park separate, and Mr. Cha finds Jiyoon wandering the halls alone. She asks him if the murders had anything to do with ""that."" Mr. Cha insists that nobody knows about whatever happened, and that she shouldn't mention it again. She tells him that there is one other person involved with the mysterious incident. In a flashback, Jiyoon is shown sitting in class when she receives a picture on her phone of a dead girl. She looks around and sees Wonho smiling at her. At a later time, Wonho approaches Jiyoon and hands her what appears to be a set of picture slides, and she in turns hands him a packet of unknown pictures. Off to the side, Mr. Cha is shown on his cell phone telling someone on the other line that Jiyoon will no longer be pestered with ""these kinds of issues.""Back at the school, Mr. Cha, carrying a hammer, follows a trail of blood to the school darkroom where he finds Wonho sitting at a desk with his head down. Mr. Cha raises his hammer to attack Wonho, who he is surprised to find is already dead. Mr. Cha notices that the wall is covered in pictures of some of the students running through the pool area during one night. He tears the photographs down, then sees the negatives in a large incinerator. An unseen force pushes him inside, slamming the door shut. The school bell rings again, and the televisions turn on to show images of Sooil's dead body and Mr. Cha locked in the darkroom incinerator. The students hurry to the darkroom to get him out, but see that the incinerator has a timed lock that requires a code word. Several of the pictures around the room and pictures on a slideshow on the wall have letters on them, pieces of the code. The students begin naming those who are featured in the photographs: Yongran, JK, and Jiyoon. Sehee figures out that the code is ""memento mori,"" but before she can input the code the incinerator turns on and burns Mr. Cha alive.After Mr. Cha's death, Sehee realizes that the characters sewn on Yongrans face mean ""to forget."" A slide of a beaten and dead Taeyeon pops up on the wall, and Sehee repeats ""memento mori,"" or ""never forget your mortality.""
Narae sees the picture as well. It dawns on her that Taeyeon didn't really commit suicide, and she demands for Sehee to tell her the truth. Kwanwoo notices that the next picture in the slideshow is of Jiyoon, and comments that
everyone in the pictures around the darkroom is now dead, except for Jiyoon, who is now missing.Jiyoon wanders the halls of the school, having left the darkroom after the other students recognized her in the pictures. Miss Park finds her, and Jiyoon tells her that she (Jiyoon) is the next to die. In a flashback, one of the student study groups - JK, Hyuna, Sooil, Yongran, and Jiyoon - are at school studying late one night. They break out a bottle of whiskey from Jiyoon's locker and get drunk; the conversation turns to sex, and Sooil reveals that he is still a virgin. They spy on Taeyeon in the gym showers, washing off after a swim. The other students pressure Sooil into raping Taeyeon. He attacks her while the others watch and laugh. Humiliated, she threatens to tell the police. Yongran informs her that Sooil's father is a prosecutor, and if she takes this to the police then they will make it look like her fault. Jiyoon hands Taeyeon a towel and tells her to go back to swimming, but Taeyeon slaps her. Jiyoon pulls her hair and she slips, hitting her head against a shower knob; Taeyeon falls to the shower floor, dead.Jiyoon, back at the locked-down school, tells Miss Park that it was an accident and that she will turn herself into the police if it means everyone can be set free. Miss Park asks Jiyoon why she decided to reveal the truth now. Jiyoon stares at Miss Parks calm face, realizing she is involved, and screams as a hidden figure grabs her.The other students wander the halls looking for Jiyoon. The televisions turn on to show Miss Park seated in front of a microphone. She tells them that they must remember that ""with every action comes responsibility."" For the
following ten minutes there will be phone signal, and locked in a safe in the auditorium is a cell phone that can be used to call for help before the time runs out. Several of the students head for the auditorium, but three of the boys head for the broadcasting studio where Miss Park is. In the studio, Miss Park sits staring at the microphone as a man standing beside her puts his hand on her shoulder. He tells her that she ""did good"" before another flashback starts.Two years earlier, the mysterious man - Jungbum - gets a text from his girlfriend, Taeyeon, that she wants to break up. He calls her cell but gets no answer; the phone is laying smashed on the ground beside the pool. The students involved in Taeyeon's death are seen running away from the pool, and pictures are taken of them by Wonho. Jungbum arrives at the pool and spots her dead body floating in the water. He drags her out to perform CPR, and Taeyeon regains consciousness long enough to speak Sooil's name before dying. Just then the swimming coach enters the pool area and screams. She testifies that Jungbum killed Taeyeon, followed by Mr. Cha, Wonho, Yongran, JK, Sooil, and Hyuna stating that Taeyeon and Jungbum were dating, Jungbum was a trouble-maker, Taeyeon was a slut, and more. When it gets to Jiyoons confession we hear the officer talking to her father, and it is hinted that her father donates money to the police. Jiyoon and her friends are free. Jungbum, on the other hand, is shown in handcuffs climbing on a bus. He has been convicted of murdering Taeyeon. Later, Jungbum's sister - revealed to be Miss Park - visits her brother in the insane asylum. She hands him an envelope that was addressed to him (presumably the pictures of Taeyeon's murder). Jungbum continuously fidgets and wraps a piece of string around his finger. He asks if his sister has seen Taeyeon, as he can't find her anywhere.Back at the school, Jungbum tells his sister that she can leave; he will handle the rest. She hugs him and leaves, but as she goes down the stairs crying she is attacked and beaten by the group of boys who had come to find her. In
the auditorium Jiyoon is tied up, rigged to a noose that will hang her if someone pulls on the key at the end of the rope - the key to open the safe containing the cell phone. The students try to untie her but can't. Kwanwoo, Sehee, and Narae try to keep Jiyoon alive, but in the end she is hung as the key is used to open the safe. The students grab the phone with only a few seconds to spare but the signal cuts out before they can get out more than a few words.Downstairs, Jungbum sets the school on fire. The students all run out of the auditorium to try and escape. The boys create a large bomb using the spray paint cans they had taken earlier, taping them to the locked gate leading to the
school doors and throwing a lighter at them to make them explode. The explosion destroys the gate. As the students leave the school grounds, Narae tells Kwanwoo that Sehee is missing.Back at the pool, Sehee stands on the edge of the diving board, remembering a time when Taeyeon helped teach her to swim. Jungbum appears behind Sehee, asking if she has seen Taeyeon; in his hands is a heavy chain
attached to a weight. He chokes her and asks if she was a part of Taeyeon's death. In another flashback, Sehee is shown fetching food for Jiyoon and the rest of the study group. She comes in just as they are planning for Sooil to
rape Taeyeon, and she begs them not to. Jiyoon tells her she can either stay and watch or leave. Sehee leaves the school, crying.Jungbum pushes Sehee over the edge of the diving baord, the weighted chain wrapped around her ankle, but she pulls him down with her. He continues to choke her underwater until Kwanwoo pulls him off. Narae attempts to get the chain off from around Sehee's ankle but can't. Sehee blacks out, and the ghostly corpse of Taeyeon grabs her ankle. Another flashback is shown of Taeyeon and Sehee in the pool, talking about going to the beach in their bikinis to flirt with men. Jungbum and Narae appear, and Jungbum begs them to take him along. Narae pushes him into the water and they all laugh. The unconscious Sehee smiles. Taeyeon's ghost-corpse sees this and slowly becomes less disfigured. She removes the chain from Sehee's ankle and watches as her step-sister's body floats to the top of the pool. Jungbum - the pleasant, happy Jungbum from the flashback who had been pushed into the pool - swims past her and together he and Taeyon's ghost swim off together hand-in-hand. The picture of Sehee, Narae, and Taeyeon floats on the pool water as the screen fades to black.During the credits, Kwanwoo is shown reviving Sehee with CPR. He holds her, and she spies something behind him. He turns and the image of his face freezes, then fades to black."

As she was looking for a rickshaw to hail, Swapnil comes on his bike and offers her help to drop her off as far as the coffee shop. She thinks he is trying to flirt with her and asks him the same but he completely denies it and says it is just a gesture of help to a girl who is going around in the heated sun looking for an address. She theorizes that she'd better accept his help lest she should have trouble finding the coffee shop and rides on his bike on the back seat to the coffee shop. At the coffee shop she gets off his bike and says thanks and starts to walk away into the coffee shop when he makes a remark that that's what he calls ""being ungrateful."" She asks him to explain himself. He explains that after having helped her so much, she doesnt even bother to offer him a glass of water. Over which she says ""Are you sure that you are not flirting with me?"" He again denies and goes back to appreciate the Puneite culture which obliges him to offer help to a girl like her in so-called trouble. She reluctantly invites him over a cup of coffee.Inside the coffee shop they start to make conversation. Swapnil learns that she's come here to meet the guy whom her mother wants her to meet for marriage proposal. He also learns that she is not interested in this 'marriage institution.' And that she has only come here to respect her mothers wish and she is going to visit his house again and turn him down. Now she has no other alternative than to wait out until the evening as the house was locked. Over the course of conversation they find out that they have difference of opinion on the subject of marriage. When their conversation ends he starts to walk out when she bluntly says that she would not pay the bill of his coffee. She says that they should pay for their coffees respectively. He startles over this and says that he does not have any money on him. She makes an indifferent gesture and says that she would only pay for her coffee and he is on his own. He sits down at the table urging her to pay his coffee bill for the moment and he would pay it back after a while. She asks him how is he going to do that and he replies that he's got an ATM card. She asks him whether he's got any money in it and he answers madly that he does. He offers her to keep his expensive watch as insurance until he repays her her money back. He withdraws money and gives her back. He sarcastically tells her that she is very good at keeping accounts and she must be a chartered accountant the way she handled the situation. She replies that she is a fashion designer and not a chartered accountant. That gives him an excuse to continue the conversation and asks her what's her opinion about the fashion of Pune is, stretching his both hands horizontally anticipating she would make an excellent remark over it. Instead she says that Pune is not that much mature about fashion. He argues over this and shows her few of his ornaments says that those particular things have originated in Pune. So, their conversation continues until they reach the basement where he'd parked his bike. As he was about to leave she asks where Sarasbaug or something is, over which he gets displeased again as he didn't happen to like the way she mentioned ""Sarasbaug or something."" It gets underlined that he is proud of everything about his city that he didn't like the way she formed her question. The incident gives them another excuse to be with each other and they go to visit Sarasbaug together.Further in the movie they go on to explore few well known places of Pune. In one of the scenes, they lose the sight of each other in the immense crowd and Swapnil thinks that Mukta's lost. He gets uneasy and desperately begins to look for her in the crowd and eventually manages to find her out. During this time Mukta spots Swapnil to have gotten to be restless when he fails to locate her in the crowd. Then she realizes that Swapnil has developed a thing for her and she gets pleased with that. They again begin their conversation. Afterwards, she gets completely angry over his senseless questions when she had got off the phone talking with someone and she tells him she needs to go to a place to cool her head. Then they go to Sinhgad (a fort) on his bike. While strolling on the fort they inadvertently begin to open up with each other about their love life and they get to know each others opinions about the subject. She finds out that Swapnil is very emotional though he doesnt look like. They unknowingly develop a friendship being with each other almost all day. As the evening draws nearer, they begin to return to the Pune station where Mukta is supposed to board the train back to Mumbai.The climax of the movie reveals that Swapnil is the boy who she was supposed to meet in the morning. However, he tactfully disguises this thing from her in order to know her better informally. When he reveals the same thing to her, she gets a pleasant shock of surprise. In the happy end, they like each other and she boards the train back to Mumbai and says that she will let him know her decision once she talks this over with her mother. (which will definitely be positive is understandable)Most of the Indian wedding used to fall into arranged marriage category in the days gone by. However, as the new generation is seen to be inclined towards western culture over the past two decades, this ritual has seemed to be fading away. This story can be summarized as ""Its the marriage which ultimately ended up being a love marriage which was supposed to have been an arranged marriage."""

A Beginner's Guide to Endings,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1516002/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Upon learning they only have a few days left to live, three brothers set off to reverse a lifetime of mistakes. In Niagara Falls, Ontario, proverbial loser Edward ""Duke"" White, father to now four adult and one adolescent sons with three different women, and not much of a father by anyone's estimation, has just killed himself, and although his body is not found, the evidence indicates that he killed himself by going over the falls. Only Duke's only wife, now ex-wife Goldie White, has and had been any sort of mother to all five, despite only being the biological mother to the first three: not too bright Eddie Jr., who had always wanted to be a boxer - he having turned pro for a while, which is where he got his nickname ""Nuts"" - despite never having shown a real aptitude for the sport; Cal, the slick Lothario who likes the finer things in life, except his women, his type being those that would proudly display their tramp stamp; and Jacob, the smart, responsible straight arrow. From the will read by the executor, the boys' paternal uncle, Father Pal, the boys learn that besides the specifically chosen memento each of the three oldest receives appropriate to his life, Duke killed himself for the sake of those three partly in an act of atonement. In addition to committing fraud against the three, the large sum of money they didn't even know they had, he did something ten years ago that will result now in their imminent deaths. After Cob confirms the accuracy of what Duke wrote, each of the three goes on an end of life journey, Nuts and Cal's specific to their respective lives in boxing and with women. While Cob does go the route of carrying out his bucket list, some of the more dangerous items on which may indeed kill him, Nuts and Cal may also find their remaining path will take them possibly closer to death, an unintended consequence.—Huggo"

Tracker,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1414378/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An Afrikaner veteran of the Boer War has just immigrated to New Zealand and is hired to track a man accused of killing a soldier. While hunting through the countryside he captures his fugitive, only to learn that he's innocent of the crime. When faced with the life-changing decision to turn him in or set him free only, one man will walk away alive.—Elizabeth Obermeier, Marketing Manager The opening credits state that the Boer War between 1899 and 1902 was the first time New Zealanders fought abroad with 6,000 volunteering to fight alongside the British against the South African Boers. When the war ended some of the defeated Boers, having lost families and farms, joined the returning soldiers in search of a new home.It's 1903 at a New Zealand harbour. Major Pritchard Carlysle is having breakfast and scrutinising the docking list for the day. He's startled and intrigued to see the name of Arjan van Diemen and asks his aide to get customs to pull him aside and escort him to see Carlysle.Sergeant Saunders intercepts the aide and discovers who is being stopped. He is fuming as he served in South Africa and recognised the name of van Diemen as the butcher of British soldiers and marches down to the docks.At the custom office Arjan van Diemen's (Ray Winstone) gaze falls on three young girls. He is brought out of his reverie by the Customs Officer. On being asked why he has come so far, he replies he is curious - curious to find out why New Zealanders crossed two oceans to help the British burn down his farm.Before the bemused man can reply, Saunders arrives, pulls a gun on van Diemen, disarms and arrests him and marches him off to Major Carlysle. Major Carlysle is furious, orders Saunders to return his gun and apologises to van Diemen saying some don't realise the war is over. He recalls he spent two years in the Transvaal trying to track van Diemen down then seems uncomfortable with his reminisces and sincerely hopes van Diemen finds a new farm.The scene switches to a stable where a Maori called Kereama (Temuera Morrison) has been having sex with Lucy a local prostitute. She asks him about a pouch around his neck which contains the dust of his grandfather's homeland. He is respectful to her and builds up her self esteem by saying she would be considered a beauty and a princess in his culture.A drunk Saunders with two corporals stagger out of a bar and notice the stable lights are on. He catches Kereama talking to Lucy and decides to teach him a lesson. At first Kereama takes the beating but then angrily shouts at them in his native tongue. They go back to beat him up again and Lucy tries to intervene. They push her aside and in the fight Saunders attempts to kill Kereama with a pitchfork but ends up killing his own corporal. Saunders panics and accuses Kereama of the murder who flees. The other corporal backs him up. Lucy is bearing a bruise on her face, and giving a frightened look to the glaring corporal, then corroborates their story.Major Carlysle arrives and is none too convinced the soldiers are telling the truth. He orders Saunders and the corporal back to barracks and organises a search party of six with a local tracker called Bryce. He refuses the offer of dogs, saying he won't be part of a blood sport.He sees van Diemen at the site and offers him money if he will join them. 100 sovereigns if he catches the Maori alive or 25 sovereigns dead. Van Diemen asks a local constable about the Maori and finds he's an expert harpoonist who left his whaling ship the previous day.The search party sets off next morning down the beach and Bryce follows the wrong tracks in the belief Kereama is intent on going further down the beach to catch another ship. Van Diemen believes the fugitive is not running away but has come home and sets off alone inland where he picks up the trail.By the end of the day Bryce realises he has been following the wrong trail. A soldier snarls they should have got the dogs but Major Carlysle orders them back to the spot where they lost the trail to pick it up again.Meanwhile van Diemen is now hot on the trail, and captures Kereama the following morning. That night van Diemen gets out his Bible and to his surprise Kereama completes the passage he was reading from memory saying he had been taught by the missionary school and also by his grandfather who said to know your enemy, you have to know his God. Kereama also asks to see the picture in van Diemen's watchcase that he keeps looking at and discovers a picture of van Diemen's family his wife and three little girls one aged eight and twins aged six. Van Diemen curtly says they are no longer alive.Next day Kereama overpowers van Diemen in a river but can't leave him to drown so pulls him out which leads to the tables being turned again.Kereama argues his grandfather lost and brought shame to their nation, as did the Boers against the British. He keeps asking how van Diemen's wife died which enrages van Diemen who looks to shoot him. However Kereama first apologises then asks again later. Van Diemen explains that the British set fire to their farms and drove off their women and children like cattle to camps where many died of sickness. But he doesn't know how his family died. They keep arguing over their respective reasons for hating the British although van Diemen denies he does. He does say that during the Boer War he and his men cut off the trigger finger of the bravest officers they captured - only the bravest - as a sign of respect. Kereama says there is no hope for him then.As the search party turns inland and the terrain becomes harder, Major Carlysle sends one of his men back to base with the horses and to get more supplies as this was taking longer than he had hoped. In a later conversation with a rookie soldier, he advises him to be sure he could give his children a worthy answer as to what he had done in defence of the realm.Kereama escapes again from van Diemen and there is a frantic chase climaxing in a vicious fight between the two men. Kereama has the chance to finish off van Diemen but refuses to do so, saying he is no killer. At that point Bryce appears with a gun followed by the rest of the search party.Major Carlysle thanks van Diemen for his efforts in securing the capture of Kereama, promising him the 100 sovereigns. Then they spy Saunders riding back with the provisions. Major Carlysle is not happy to see him. He rebukes him later when he catches Saunders glaring at Kereama ordering him to remember that this is not a vendetta.As they camp that night, van Diemen asks for meat and goes to feed Kereama who has been tied to a tree. They talk to van Diemen about the so-called freedom he was fighting for back in South Africa and Kereama telling how he was forced to watch the British kill his grandfather. He tried to bury him but was too small and ran away. He always knew he would one day come back to set them free. Van Diemen asks if this was why he came back in order to restore family honour. Kereama replies that it was, and that he had almost made it home over the next ridge but van Diemen had denied him.Van Diemen goes back to the soldiers without his knife. Kereama discovers this and waits until most are asleep, and uses the knife to cuts his ropes. He then overpowers the rookie guard and escapes. When his flight is discovered the next morning, Bryce is suspicious about the circumstances but van Diemen leaves first saying he has a score to settle.Saunders then tells Major Carlysle that the rookie's gun is missing which means they must now be prepared to shoot to kill on sight, much to the Major's reluctance. As they move off, the camera clearly shows the rifle lying on the ground.Van Diemen leaves a false trail for Bryce and the search party so he can buy time for Kereama. He tracks him down preparing to enter his ancestors' sacred cave. Whilst Kereama is in there, van Diemen kneels down outside with the Bible open and the picture of his family in view and prays.Kereama emerges and they leave together, van Diemen now protecting Kereama. Kereama says he's still curious to know why they cut off the trigger finger of those British officers in the Boer War? Van Diemen simply replies it was a sin to kill and this stopped good men from sinning.Kereama realises he can no longer run and when they get to a small waterfall, van Diemen encourages him to stand and fight with him. He gives him his pistol but Kereama refuses, again saying he is not a killer. When they see the search party getting close, Kereama asks for a favour - for van Diemen to shoot him so he doesn't die like his grandfather. He hands the gun back to van Diemen and turns his back on him. Van Diemen hesitates then fires. As the search party approaches, van Diemen is standing at the edge of the pool with Kereama's body lying face down under the waterfall.Van Diemen hands a bloodied bandage to the Major which contains an index finger. He tells the Major it was another trophy for his Majesty's government and says Kereama had courage and deserves respect.This enrages Saunders who wants Kereama's head but one punch from van Diemen sends him sprawling back down the hill. Major Carlysle turns to leave as well but van Diemen insists that Kereama's body should be carried down and buried. The Major says sorry but enough time has already been spent.Now back at his base Major Carlysle idly watches a man wash the back of his head, face down under a standpipe. A slow realisation comes over him and he shouts out that he's alive and he wants a soldier at every port and whaling station looking for a Maori with a missing index finger. The order is to bring him back alive.The final scene is on a beach where a small group of passengers are waiting for a launch to take them to a ship bound for Australia. Major Carlysle on horseback rides down the beach up to van Diemen sitting away from the group. He dismounts and gives van Diemen 25 guineas reward. He tells him that he knows the Maori's still alive.There is a flashback to the waterfall scene where we see van Diemen shoot to miss and Kereama just stand there. Van Diemen then pistol-whips him so he falls down the small waterfall into the pool. Van Diemen races down to place Kereama face down under the waterfall and then pulls out a knife.Back to the beach and the Major cannot understand why van Diemen let him go but says he must have had his reasons. Van Diemen accepts the money and says its quite a sum but why so generous? Then realisation dawns on him. He squares up to Major Carlysle and looks him in the eye and asks whether he gave the order to burn down his farm and whether there was anyone still in the farm as it burned. Major Carlysle assures van Diemen he did not give the order nor was there anyone in the farm while it burned. Van Diemen is satisfied and they part as he gets in the launch and the Major back on his horseThe scene switches back to the waterfall where Kereama comes to and sees he's alone and still freeIt switches forward to the present where Major Carlysle, who, as he is riding away, calls after van Diemen that every whaling station is being watched and that the Maori won't be free for long.The scene switches back to Kereama arriving at a station where a clerk gives him papers to sign and watches carefully. Then the clerk gives an imperceptible shake of the head to a soldier nearby who sits back with a shrug. Kereama hands back the pen and leaves.Finally we are back to the launch as Major Carlysle gallops off down the beach, van Diemen puffs on his pipe and the camera pans down to his hand with a bandage over a stump where his index finger should be. He takes out his watchcase and looks at the photo of his family and as a tear trickles down his face he smiles at them at peace with himself."

The apparition is joined by a demon who offers him a deal. The film opens with images of a foggy river running through a densely wooded area. Next to the river, theres a quiet, empty cabin. Each room of the cabin is silent and still. A man (Shane West) in a white long sleeve shirt is standing silently staring out a window. Theres a dock to the river outside the cabin. The man is then at the kitchen table, staring silently outside. Music on an old record player is playing while the man is sitting in the living room in the dark.In the morning, the man is staring out the window. Theres a storm outside. A crash of thunder and a loud bang sound throughout the empty cabin. The bang catches the mans attention. The front door is open and he stares at it. The door behind him flings open and a figure in a rain poncho walks through the living room. Its a woman (Mira Sorvino). She doesnt see the man because he is a Ghost. She hangs up her raincoat in a closet and closes the door. She then opens the door again and steps back. The door closes on its own and The Woman smiles. The Ghost is standing in the corner of the room watching her with a furrowed brow. She walks through the house with her bags and goes into a bedroom and starts to unpack. She looks at old black and white photos sitting on a dresser. She then goes to the kitchen and lights a gas lantern. She pumps water into the sink, fills a kettle, and puts it on the wood burning stove. She starts to unpack some groceries and reaches into a high cupboard and pulls out a bottle of alcohol that she knew was there. She smiles, uncorks it, smells it smiling, and sets it on the counter. She then notices a coffee mug on the kitchen table, picks it up, and blows dust off it. The tea kettle whistles. We see a meadow at sunset. The Woman is at the kitchen table with a lantern having dinner and a glass of wine. She finishes her meal and takes her dishes to the sink. Through the kitchen window, we see the Ghost slowly appear behind her, watching her with a furrowed brow.In the morning, theres a rainbow over the river. The Woman leaves the cabin and takes a motorboat down the river. We next see her back at the cabin. Shes walking outside and we see the Ghost standing at a window watching her. She goes to an outhouse in the woods. She looks at the outhouse and pauses. She picks up a stick and goes in the outhouse. We hear banging from inside the outhouse and then silence. A bird then flies into the side of the outhouse and dies. The Woman comes out slowly with the stick, looks around the side, and sees the dead bird. She kneels and touches it gently. We then see the Ghost looking out the window, watching her as she digs a small hole and places the bird gently in the grave. He looks less angry as he watches her.Its nighttime and The Woman is sitting in the living room listening to a record. The windup record player slowly stops playing. The Ghost is sitting across from her watching her. She puts out the fire and takes the lantern upstairs. The Woman gets in bed and blows out the lantern. The record then suddenly starts playing on its own. The Woman relights the lantern and slowly walks downstairs. She goes into the living room. The Ghost is sitting by the record player. She shuts off the record and goes back to bed.In the morning, The Woman is arranging books on the table and opens a notebook to start writing when she hears a boat. The Ghost is standing in the doorway. She stands to look outside and sees a boat coming towards the dock. The Ghost and The Woman each stand at a window and watch the approaching boat. The Woman heads downstairs and walks down the dock. An old man (Muse Watson) gets out of the boat with a box of groceries while a young man in a black hooded sweater (Adam Croce) waits in the boat. The Woman asks Mr. Browman if he would like some coffee, but he declines and says he needs to get back to the store. He asks her if shes okay in the cabin. She happily says she is. He says hed be scared to be there and she says shell be fine. He says its creepy and she insists shell be fine. He says okay and then tells her he brought her some fresh chickens and tells her to keep them in the shed because the weather is cold enough to make the shed like a refrigerator. She thanks him. The Ghost in the house watches as the storeowner gets back in the boat and leaves. We next see The Woman taking the chickens out to the shed. She walks in and leaves the door open. A shadow forms on the wall outside of the shed and the door slams shut startling The Woman. She goes to the door and looks out the window as the shadow recedes. She tries to open the door but struggles with it for a few moments before it opens. She steps out panting and nervous.The woods and river are quiet as it starts to rain. The Woman is inside and notices a bookcase open. She shuts it and starts to walk away when she kicks a book that somehow ended up on the floor in the middle of the room. She picks it up and looks back at the case wondering how it got there. She opens the book The Complete Outdoorsmans Handbook and flips through the pages. In the book is an old newspaper clipping. She pulls it out and reads the headline Escaped Criminal Drowns: Man accused of murder found dead in Piken Lake. She puts the clipping back in the book.We next see The Woman that night lying in bed biting her fingernail. The Ghost is in the bedroom watching her as she blows out the lantern. The next morning, The Woman is startled awake and opens her eyes quickly. The Ghost is lying next to her staring her in the face. She quickly gets out of bed and looks around the room. The Ghost, still lying on the bed, watches her. She gets dressed and leaves the room. She sits at the kitchen table with a steaming mug, then goes into the living room and gets her cell phone from her purse. She takes it outside and makes a call asking for Mr. Browman. He isnt there, but she leaves a message that shes just checking in. She goes back in the cabin and puts her phone back in the purse. She then leaves the cabin wearing a heavy coat. The Ghost is standing at the door and looks as though he wants to follow her but cant. She walks through the dense woods and goes to the outhouse, again taking a stick in with her. We hear banging and then silence. Once again, a bird flies into the side of the outhouse and dies.The Ghost is looking out a window at a storm when the record player starts. He is then in the living room looking at the record player with a furrowed brow. Behind him, The Woman is also staring at the record player looking nervous. Neither of them turned it on. The front door then bangs open startling The Woman. A man (Justin Kirk) walks in and she hugs him. The Man is happy to see that she isnt angry at him for coming unannounced. The record player slowly stops playing. The Woman takes his coat and The Man tells her that Mr. Browman brought him to the island. The Man comments that Mr. Browman told him that there had been a storm the day shed arrived to the island as well. He looks around the cabin and asks her about the summers shed spent there as a child. He asks her to show him around and then points out the record player. She brushes it off and takes the record off the turntable. She suggests they unpack his bags and he says theres no hurry and says she can show him around first. He asks her if shes okay and she nods. They hug and The Man tells The Woman that hes missed her. Then he whispers in her ear and she laughs. They lie down on the couch and hold each other and laugh. The Ghost is upstairs listening to them.Later that day, the storm stops and The Woman shows The Man around the cabin. She takes him into her bedroom and tells him he can unpack. She tells him about her childhood summers at the cabin with her family. She talks about playing hide-and-seek and tells him she had the best hiding place on the entire island and offers to show it to him sometime. He pulls out a bottle of wine from his bag and she says theyll have it with dinner. They kiss and then The Man notices the black and white pictures on the dresser and asks if the people are her grandparents. She says yes and The Man comments that her grandmother was beautiful. The Woman says that her grandmother meant the world to her and tells The Man that her grandfather bought the cabin because her grandmother wanted it and that her grandfather hardly ever came to the cabin. The Man comments that she never talks about her grandfather. The Woman says that there isnt a need to because he wasnt a good guy. The Man asks, Like your dad? The Woman considers for a moment and says, Sure. She turns and walks away.That night, over dinner, The Man is telling The Woman about a party shed missed and says he wished shed been there. She says she needed to be at the cabin. He says he just likes having her around, and The Woman says that hell get a lot of her at the cabin. He says he hopes that it was okay that he came to the island.That night, in the dark, The Man wakes up The Woman and says he needs to go to the bathroom. She jokingly says, I told you to go before we went to bed, young man. She lights the lantern and gives it to him telling him to pee off the porch. He says thats not what he needs to do. She gives him directions to follow the path to the outhouse and he asks if shell walk him out there. She smiles at him and closes her eyes. He gets out of bed and the Ghost is standing next to the bed watching them. Before The Man leaves, The Woman tells him to use a stick to get rid of the spiders on the seat. The Man follows the path, sees the outhouse, and says, Youve got to be kidding me. He picks up a stick and goes inside. He closes the door and bangs the stick around the seat multiple times. He sits down to relieve himself and the lantern falls and breaks leaving him in the dark. Then the outhouse starts to shake and bang. He runs from the outhouse as a dense fog begins to roll in. He gets back in bed and wraps his arms around The Woman. She asks if it went okay but he doesnt answer.The next morning, The Woman takes The Man to see her favorite hiding spot. She shows him the small window that leads to the crawl space under the house. She says she sometimes used to go in there even when they werent playing hide-and-seek and that it was a good place to be alone. He seems surprised and asks if she got scared down there. She says no, that it stayed cool in there during the summer and she enjoyed listening to her grandmother move around the kitchen. The Woman says she felt safe there. She then asks The Man about his visit to the outhouse the night before. He sighs and shakes his head and she asks if he was scared. He says, Cmon, youve seen that place. She agrees and says thats why she doesnt go there in the dark. The Man says it wouldnt have been so bad if it hadnt been for all the banging. The Woman looks startled. The Man says it was from tree branches banging against the walls from the wind.They go for a walk around the island. The Woman shows The Man a great view from a cliff and tells him its another of her secret places. He says its beautiful and then says shes beautiful. He tells her that their 3 years together have been the best of his life. He says that he knows she has doubts and he understands why, but he doesnt have any doubts. He says he wants to spend his life with her and start a family with her. He pulls a ring box from his pocket and asks her to marry him. She pauses and looks unsure. He says hes not like the men from her family, he knows that its hard for her to believe that hes a good man, and he assures her that she can trust him and have faith in him. She doesnt respond, so he closes the ring box, takes her hand, gives it to her, and asks her to think about it. They hug for a moment and then suddenly theres a whisper and the edge of the cliff gives way beneath his feet. The Man falls over the edge, but The Woman grabs his arms and helps him back onto the cliff. They lie down next to each other panting and then start to laugh. She tells him she loves him and then says shell marry him. They kiss and he asks if anybody has made love on the cliff before. The Woman laughs and then sits up in a panic looking for the ring. Shed had it in her hand when The Man fell and she doesnt know where it went. After an unsuccessful search, they go back to the cabin. She apologizes for losing the ring and The Man says its okay, she was saving his life. He hugs her and she apologizes again.Later that day, The Man is taking a nap and The Woman is outside on a bench with a book in her lap. The Ghost is in the bedroom watching The Man sleep when he hears whispering. The Ghost is then in the living room looking out the window where The Woman is now asleep on the bench. The Ghost doesnt know where the whispering is coming from. A little later, The Man wakes up from his nap and calls for his girlfriend. He finds her outside on the bench reading and comments that its cold outside. The Woman aloofly replies that shes fine. The Man asks her why she didnt wake him up and she responds without looking at him that she thought he needed sleep. The Man asks if theyre going to eat and The Woman responds that shes going to keep working and she still doesnt look at him. The Man asks if shell help him light the stove since he hasnt done it before. The Woman finally looks at him and says coldly, If you want to be here, you have to take care of yourself. Its not that hard. The Man looks hurt and goes back inside. In the kitchen, hes preparing to light the stove when The Woman comes in and helps him.The next morning, The Woman brings a mug to The Man in bed and says its a peace offering and apologizes for her behavior the night before. The Man tells her its okay and offers to leave so she can do her work alone, saying he can go when the storeowner comes back to the island. She says no and tells him shes glad hes there. In the kitchen, The Man is helping The Woman with the dishes. She thanks him for helping and he jokes that hed make a good wife. The Woman laughs. The Man says hes going to go explore the island and leave her to her work, and that hell make dinner when he gets back. He jokes that the stove might get the best of him and The Woman asks if hed like her help lighting it. The Man says no and tells her that hes watched her do it and he can figure it out. He leaves to explore the island and walks past the Ghost whos standing in the corner with his fists clenched and his brow furrowed.When The Man comes back from his walk, he has wildflowers for The Woman. She smiles and he asks her about her day. She says shes having trouble getting focused and asks him about his walk. He says he took the worlds longest hike and comments that the island is a lot bigger than he thought. He tells her that hes about to start dinner and jokingly says that it will be ready in about five hours. She thanks him for the flowers and he goes downstairs.The Ghost is watching The Man in the kitchen making dinner when he hears the whispering again. He looks around him and then looks up to the ceiling when he realizes the whispering is coming from upstairs. The Ghost walks up the stairs and peers around the corner to see a man in a black suit (Tony Curran) kneeling beside The Woman whispering in her ear. Only bits of what hes saying can be heard: What hell do to you disgusting it makes you sick, doesnt it? It makes me sick too. The Woman looks upset as shes working. As The Man in Black is speaking, he turns and looks at the Ghost smiling maliciously. The Ghost steps back into the hallway. The whispering stops and the Ghost peers back into the room. The Woman is alone. When the Ghost steps back into the hall, The Man in Black is behind him and quietly says, Boo. When the Ghost spins around, The Man in Black is not there. The Ghost looks frightened.That evening, The Man goes upstairs and enthusiastically tells the Woman that dinner is ready. She doesnt look up. The Man tells her that he made spaghetti and he thinks its pretty good. The Woman stonily tells him that shes going to keep working. The Man laughs uncomfortably and starts to object. The Woman says that she has to keep working and thats why she came to the cabin. The Man says, Right, I just thought and The Woman cuts him off and cruelly says, Its not fair of you to keep asking me to spend time with you when I didnt even want you here. The Man asks her what happened. She yells at him to just leave her alone. The Man is hurt and walks back downstairs alone. Later that night, The Man is awake in bed when The Woman gets in bed. Their backs are to each other and neither speaks. The Ghost is in the room facing the window but looking at them over his shoulder.The next morning, The Man takes a mug outside to The Woman who is sitting on the bench. He offers her the coffee and she doesnt look at him. He sits next to her and gives her the mug. He says he did alright with the coffee and that hes getting pretty good in the kitchen. She doesnt drink the coffee. The Man puts his hand on her knee and she moves away and quickly stands up saying she needs to get started on her work. She goes inside, leaving The Man alone on the bench, and walks past the Ghost who is in the living room looking out the window.Suddenly The Man in Black is behind the Ghost. The Man in Black says, See how easy it can be?"" The Man in Black tell the Ghost that it wouldn't take much for The Woman to be his. The Ghost looks away from him. The Man in Black says to the Ghost, I know youve thought about it. Ive watched you. As they look out the window at The Man on the bench, The Man in Black asks the Ghost, But then, what can you do? The Ghost disappears leaving The Man in Black in the living room. In the kitchen, the Ghost is looking out the window. The Man in Black is behind him and taunting him that he can't have The Woman. The Ghost spins around and looks at The Man in Black. The Man in Black asks the Ghost. Why would you even try? The Ghost disappears again. The Man in Black looks up to ceiling. The Ghost is upstairs. The Man in Black is again behind the Ghost and says, You cant do much of anything really. The Ghost spins around and looks at him. The Man in Black tells the Ghost that he could have many things, pleasures that hes been denied for a long time. The Man in Black holds up a cigarette and says that the Ghost can enjoy old vices that can no longer harm him. The Ghost is listening to The Man in Black. The Man in Black says, Escape from this place, and approaches the Ghost. The Man in Black tells him that his eternity is only just beginning. He asks if he really wants to spend eternity trapped in the cabin. The Man in Black says, ""Imagine being anywhere you want any time. Freedom. The Man in Black smiles at the Ghost before continuing. Or, he says putting his arm around the Ghosts shoulders, would you rather spend it even in a different way. The Man in Black looks into the hallway. The Woman is slowly walking out of a room and goes to the stairs. She looks over the rail. The Man in Black looks at the Ghost and says, I can give you many things. Then, whispering, The Man in Black says, I can give you everything. The Man in Black disappears and the Ghost is alone in the room. The voice of The Man in Black says, Its your choice.That night, The Man and the Woman are having dinner in the kitchen. They arent speaking to each other, but there is whispering. The Ghost watches The Man in Black kneeling between the couple whispering to them. The Man in Black says to The Woman, Hes going to molest your children. You have to see that. The Man in Black leans to The Man and says, You have to understand that she does not want any commitment at all. The Ghost is listening to The Man in Black as he whispers. The Man in Black turns and looks at the Ghost and says, Easy. The Ghost looks uneasy. The Man in Black stands, approaches the Ghost, and says to him, Just give me your hand and youll be free. The Ghost looks concerned. The Man in Black says, You only have to do one thing and she can be all yours. The Man in Black looks over his shoulder at The Man. The Ghost understands the implication and looks stunned. The Man in Black tells him to think about it.The next morning, The Man is outside on the bench. The Ghost is in the living room looking at him through the window. The Man in Black says to the Ghost, Youll be no different than you are now. The Man in Black is watching the Ghost. He approaches the Ghost and joins him at the window looking at The Man. The Man in Black says, He may even take your place. The Man stands from the bench and walks away from the cabin. The Man in Black tells the Ghost, You cant get something for nothing. The Man in Black backs away from the Ghost heading towards the door. The Ghost closes his eyes looking dismayed. The Man in Black says to the Ghost, You of all people should know that. The front door opens slowly. The Ghost looks at The Man in Black standing by the door. The Man in Black holds out his hand. The Ghost approaches him slowly. He pauses in front of The Man in Black. He looks from his hand to his face and then takes his hand. The Man in Black leads the Ghost outside. The Ghost steps outside alone and closes his eyes looking content. The Man in Black steps out of the house and says, Easy. The Ghost sees The Man walking back to the cabin. The Man in Black puts his hand on the Ghosts shoulder and whispers in his ear. The Ghost looks troubled. The Man in Black says, Trust me.In the kitchen, The Woman is cutting vegetables. She takes a drink from the bottle of alcohol she found in the kitchen when she arrived. The Man walks into the kitchen and greets her. She doesnt respond or look at him. The Man asks if shes not talking to him. She still doesnt respond or look at him. The Man says to her, First you say youll marry and now you act like you dont want anything to do with me. She finally responds asking, What do you want me to say. He says he wants her to say that shes happy to be engaged and that she didnt waste 3 years of his life while she was trying to decide if she was capable of being with somebody. She responds asking how she could happy with him pushing her and needling her. She says shes never going to be good enough for him the way she is, which is broken. She tells him that he wants to sweep everything under the rug like nothing ever happened to her just like her family did when she was a kid. She says he wants her to be perfect but that shes not perfect and its not going to ever be perfect. The Man is angry and says that its always the guys fault, even though hes the one guy that always stays when she runs, even out in the middle of nowhere on this island. The Woman tells him that she didnt even want him to come. She says the cabin is her special place and that he wont even let her have that. She says that he invaded and took over and started following her around and then yells at him for looking at her the wrong way. She accuses him of trying to control her just like he did. The Man asks how she could ever compare him to her father. She says that her mother didnt even know and that she wouldnt see it. The Woman says she wont sign up for a life like that bringing children into a world thats a living hell. The Man tells her to stop and asks her who she is. Shes holding her hands up defensively, even though The Man is not being aggressive. He tells her to calm down. The Woman asks if he knows how many people showed up to her fathers funeral. She said it was 500 people, practically the whole town, and they were all singing the praises of this good man. The people had no idea what hed been doing to her for all those years. The Woman asks The Man how he can know her and how can she know him. The Man says that she knows him. She says that maybe she does finally know him and that maybe she can see though his calm exterior and finally see him for who he really is. She tells him that shes done and that it was a mistake for him to come to the cabin. He says okay and tells her that hell leave as soon as the storeowner comes back. The Woman tells him Mr. Browman wont be back for 3 days, so The Man says that hell take the boat. She says that hell get lost and then shell just have to come rescue him. He asks her what she wants him to do. She yells that she wants him to take charge and call Mr. Browman to come pick him up and get off her island. He says he will. She leaves the kitchen. The man goes upstairs to get her phone, but the battery doesnt have power. He yells that the phone is dead because she left it on, so hes taking the boat. The Man is very upset about the breakup and starts to cry. The Ghost and The Man in Black watch The Man crying. The Ghost looks upset, but The Man in Black is grinning. The Ghost sees The Man in Black smiling at The Mans misery.The Woman is at the cliff also crying. Shes remembering The Man giving her the ring there, thinking about him arriving to the island, and hearing him say that he isnt like the men in her family. Shes thinking about him kissing her and holding her and telling her that hes a good man. The Woman begins to sob. When she turns to leave, she kicks the ring box that she had dropped the day The Man had proposed. She picks it up, opens the box, and pulls out the ring. She puts it on her finger.Back at the cabin, The Man is about to leave the cabin with his bags. He goes in the closet to get his coat. He hears a noise and stops. He drops his bags and steps out of the closet. The noise continues. He leaves the room to investigate the sound and the closet door closes. The Man goes out the back of the house and sees that the window to the crawl space is open. He calls to The Woman and asks if shes alright. Theres no response, so he crawls under the house calling for her. Theres a loud thud and then silence.The Woman is hurrying back to the cabin hoping to catch The Man before he leaves. Shes calling for him and apologizing saying she doesnt know what came over her. She walks into the bedroom to find that The Mans clothes are gone. She thinks hes already left. She starts to cry and sits down on the bed. In the living room, the Ghost is looking out the window and The Man in Black is telling him that it gets easier. The Man in Black says that it becomes fun. He tells the Ghost that there are rewards and that With each one, you grow in the masters eyes. The Ghost looks unsettled. The Man in Black says that the master is good to those who serve him. The Man in Black reminds the Ghost that freedom comes with a price. The Ghost starts to speak but the Man in Black interrupts him and tells him not yet. He tells him that with each task, hell get more and more. The Man in Black whispers to the Ghost, He wants you to prove yourself. The Man in Black tells the Ghost that theyre going to have a little fun.Upstairs in the bedroom, The Woman is lying on the bed crying. The Man in Black concentrates and fills the house with whispers. The Woman hears the voice of her father as though from a memory. Her father is telling her that if she tells her mother hell slap them both. Her fathers voice says shes a good girl and tells her to come here and that he wants to tell her a story. The voice tells her to open the book. The Woman leaves the bedroom and goes into the hallway. The voice of The Man in Black is asking her if she remembers what her father did to her. The Ghost is watching The Man in Black, who is enjoying what hes doing. Suddenly the Man in Black breaks his concentration when theres a quiet rumble outside the cabin. The Ghost also notices the rumble. Upstairs, The Woman grabs the stair rail as the house slightly rattles. The Man in Black looks around uneasily and the Ghost looks frightened. Then The Man in Black and the Ghost hear a noise from beneath them. The Man in Black angrily asks the Ghost what he did. The Ghost looks uncomfortable and The Man in Black yells that The Man had better be dead. The Man in Black disappears.The Woman enters the living room and looks around slowly. The Ghost watches her. Suddenly the closet door flings open startling The Woman. She sees The Mans bags and coat in the closet. The Ghost closes his eyes and concentrates. The Woman seems to sense that the Ghost is there. She walks out of the closet and looks around. The room is empty. The closet door closes startling her again. She asks out loud if someone is there. Theres a bang. She asks, Who are you? Theres no response. She asks, ""Are you still here?"" Theres a bang. She asks, ""Why are you here?"" but there is no response. She asks, ""Do you live here?"" Theres a bang. She asks, ""Should I be afraid of you?"" She hears two bangs. She looks at her engagement ring and asks, ""Did my fiancé leave?"" She hears two bangs. She asks, ""Is he okay?"" She again hears two bangs. She gets frantic and asks, ""Where is he?"" Theres no response. She then asks, ""Do you know where he is?"" Theres a bang. She asks where. Theres no response. She asks if hes in the house. Theres no response. She asks if hes outside. Theres no response. She asks, ""Are you still here?"" Theres a bang. She hears a whisper that sounds like a roar. She quietly asks, ""Was that you?"" She hears two bangs. She asks, ""Who else is here?"" Theres no response. She asks, ""Is there someone else here?"" Theres a bang. She asks, ""Should I be afraid of them?"" Theres a loud bang and the doors fly open and the curtains move wildly and The Woman screams and falls to the ground covering her head. She runs from the house and sees the window open to the crawl space. She crawls in and sees The Man lying unconscious on the ground.Inside, The Man in Black has the Ghost by his neck against a wall. The Man in Black is angry at the Ghost for communicating with The Woman and tells him how bad things are about to get for him. The Man in Black takes the Ghosts face in his hands and threatens both the Ghost and The Woman. The Ghost is terrified. The Man in Black throws the Ghost across the house.Under the house, The Woman is caressing The Mans head asking him to say something. The Woman starts to cry and then starts to pray. The Man in Black interrupts her, revealing himself to her and saying that she was right about The Man. Shes startled and the window to the crawl space slams shut behind her. The Man in Black tells The Woman that The Man is going to do to her what her father had done and that he's going to do it to her children. She disagrees with The Man in Black, but he smiles at her and tells her, ""I'm a good man. You can trust me."" The Man in Black said that this is what her father said to her mother the day he proposed to her and that they both know it wasnt true. The Woman asks The Man in Black how he could know that. He says that he was there and that he watched over her mother as hed watched over The Woman growing up. The Man in Black told her that he saw it all and that he knows why she used to come down into the crawl space. The Woman cries and says it wasnt her fault. The Man in Blacks voice whispers that it was the way she behaved in front of her father. The Man in Black says that now The Man wants to do it too, saying that it was the real reason The Man had come to the cabin. The Man in Black says that The Man is never going to leave her alone because men like him never do until they die. The Man in Black tells her that nobody will ever know what goes on at the cabin. He tells her that she can be free of The Man forever and that he can help her. The Man in Black says that she can trust him. The Woman picks up a large rock and raises it over her head crying. The Man in Black is encouraging her to kill her fiancé.Suddenly theres a crash and The Woman hears The Mans voice saying that he wants to spend his life with her and that hes a good man and she can trust him. She hears him telling her that she knows him. She drops the rock on the ground. The Man in Black asks her what shes doing and tells her that she has to stop it. The Woman says that she is going to stop it and that she knows The Man and that he does really love her and she loves him. Then she tells The Man in Black that she knows him and recognizes him. She tells him that he is the liar thats always been around and that shes not going to listen to him anymore. The Man in Black becomes enraged and The Woman tells him that shes not scared of him. The Man in Blacks face distorts into a demonic face, lunges at her, and disappears.The Woman focuses her attention on The Man, telling her unconscious fiancé that shes going to go outside to find something to help her get him out and shell be right back. She gets out of the crawl space and runs to the shed. But The Man in Black is inside. She runs around the shed and The Man in Black is blocking her path. She turns and runs back towards the cabin and The Man in Black is standing next to the opening to the crawl space. She spins around and The Man in Black is right in front of her. She looks him straight in the eye and tells him to do his worst. The Man in Black takes a step toward her when suddenly a twig snaps behind him. The Woman looks over his shoulder and her eyes widen, her jaw drops, and her breath shudders. The Man in Black stops and watches her terrified face for a moment. The Woman turns and runs. The Man in Black slowly turns around and sees what The Woman was staring at. The Man in Black screams in pain and agony for several moments as The Woman crouches next to the crawl space opening.The Ghost is in the living room looking out the window. He sees a darkly clad figure standing in the trees looking at the cabin. The Woman enters the living room and looks out the window. She also sees the figure. Its now closer to the cabin. Suddenly, the figure is gone. The Woman backs away from the window in fear. The Ghost turns and looks at her. He closes his eyes and concentrates for a moment and then yells. The Woman is startled and turns toward him. She can see him now. They look at each other for several moments. The Ghost then whispers, ""Forgive me.""The front door then starts to rattle and shake. The door opens and the Woodsman (DeObia Oparei) enters the cabin. The Woman backs away fearfully and the Ghost steps forward to protect her. The Ghost holds his hand up and tells the Woodsman no. The Woodsman stops and looks at the Ghost. The Woodsman closes his eyes and, behind him, a brilliant white light fills the doorway. The Ghost is astonished and then also closes his eyes and they silently share the images of their thoughts. The Ghost sees that the Woodsman was on the cliff the day The Man proposed, and when The Man had started to fall from the cliff, the Woodsman gave The Woman the strength to pull The Man back up. The Woodsman sees that the Ghost had opened the closet door to show The Woman that The Man had not left. And The Woman sees that when she returned to the cliff that morning, the Woodsman had placed the ring box where she would find it. The Woodsman and the Ghost open their eyes and look at each other. The Woodsman offers the Ghost his hand. The Ghost is unsure and looks back at The Woman who is crying with happiness. She smiles at him. The Ghost looks back to the Woodsman and takes his hand. The Woodsman leads the Ghost out of the cabin into the brilliant white light outside the door. Before he walks out, the Ghost looks back at The Woman one last time, and the Ghost and the Woodsman are enveloped in the light. The Woman closes her eyes and the light fades. When she opens her eyes, Mr. Browman is in the doorway. She gasps and he apologizes for startling her. Mr. Browman says he was stopping by to check if she was okay. She asks why hes there. Mr. Browman tells her that hes had a funny feeling all day that something was wrong and that hed been trying to call her but couldnt get through. The Woman tells him that her fiancé is hurt badly and they need to get him some help. Mr. Browman asks where The Man is and she tells him hes under the house. Mr. Browman says, ""Lets go get him.""The Woman is waiting in Mr. Browmans boat. The Man is lying down with his head in her lap. Shes running her hands through his hair. The Man says, ""It looks like you had to save me again,"" and The Woman laughs. She says, ""Not really."" The Man asks what happened. The Woman shushes him and tells him he needs to rest and that shell tell him later. She tells him that she loves him and kisses him on the forehead. Mr. Browman arrives to the boat, unties from the dock, and sits at the boats wheel. He asks The Woman if shes ready and she nods. The three of them set off for town in the sunset. As the boat passes by, we see the young man in the black hooded sweater appear next to Mr. Browman. The figure leans over and whispers in Mr. Browmans ear."

These visions are shared by his clients, both scaring and exciting them. Paul is searching for his twin brother, whom he hasn't seen since childhood, and hooks up with enigmatic film director John Baxter. Desired by everyone but lost to himself, Paul is persuaded to make one adult film, which will help him discover himself, and in the process find his twin. But the journey he goes on is a dark one, involving dangerous clients, an unscrupulous rival producer, and unsafe sex. In discovering his true past, Paul is in danger of destroying himself.""Selling your body doesn't mean selling your soul""A young and exquisitely beautiful escort, Paul, is desired by everyone who comes into contact with him but lost to himself. Paul has a rare gift, apart from his beauty. When he has sex with his clients, he experiences overwhelming visions that put him into a transcendental state. Sometimes, his visions are shared by his clients, both scaring and exciting them.Alive to his senses, Paul's visions show him a beautiful World, but there is darkness bleeding through. In his dreams, Paul often glimpses his brother Saul, his identical twin, from whom Paul was separated when he was but a child. Paul is convinced that Saul is in trouble, that he has also got into escorting, and that he is being pursued by a dangerous client who cannot let go.. Paul seems to project all his own fears and desires onto this client, an unfathomable black coated figure, in a white mask.Paul must lose himself in sex in order to have these visions and find out more, but every time he is with a client he gives up a little bit of his soul. Beaten up by a client who has seen inside his dreams. Paul is rescued by Zhivago, a barman who offers to introduce him to porn director, John Baxter, one of the regulars at his bar. Paul doesn't get close to Zhivago, saying that he can't love anyone right now. He keeps his distance because the sex that causes him to trip is rougher and more dangerous. Stealing Baxter's business card, Paul goes to the director's flat.Like Paul, Baxter is searching for something beyond the normal. In his case it's the wish to make a mainstream film that transcends reality. Sensing that he had found his muse in Paul, Baxter agrees to help him find Saul, but only if he appears in his film. Baxter reasons that if Paul discovers himself through the project, it will help him find his brother. He asks Don't you want to live for ever Paul? like Dorian Gray, on film at leastElecting to sleep in the studio where Baxter shoots his films, Paul hears noises from elsewhere in the building and increasingly dreams of the alternative World inhabited by his brother and the man in the mask. The space is also used as a painting studio by Griffin one of Baxter's models and another young escort with whom Paul falls a little in love. One night, Paul discovers a painting that intrigues him, and one which he has seen in his dreams. It is a reinterpretation of the story of Narcissus, which shows a boy bewitched by his own beauty but also haunted by a dark, looming figure.Atone of Baxter's parties, Paul is introduced to DeLeon, a sinister producer, working for the studio that finances Baxter's films. Deleon also becomes obsessed with Paul, and his gift. After trying, to no avail, to persuade Baxter to shoot bareback films, he encourages Paul to shoot without condoms as a way of experiencing a purer vision, and thus seeing more clearly into this other World.Frustrated by his lack of progress in finding his twin, and disturbed by his dreams, Paul goes on a bleak journey of drugs and rough sex, in an attempt to deaden his senses and fill his soul.Paul is betrayed by the sweetest of Baxter's models, and is tricked into one final porn shoot. There, Paul will discover his twin's true identity and will come face to face with the man in the mask. Inspired by the heightened sensuality of the films of Michael Powell, and by the red and green hued gialli of Mario Bava, but born of a context where safer sex is increasingly becoming marginalized and forgotten, Seeing Heaven makes a case for the primacy of the body alongside that of the spirit."

There, she discovers that her ex-husband, zoologist Charles LeBlanc is attempting to buy the wetland for unknown reasons, and is looking for Pappy. After Laura drives him off, she is met by a man named Matt, who will be soon drafted into the Marines. Matt asks Laura to give him, and his girlfriend Mandy a tour of the wetland so he can propose to her later that evening. Laura reluctantly agrees, and the three head off on a small motorboat.That evening, Matt proposes to Mandy, and she accepts as the group takes a break at a dock. Laura soon witnesses her father being thrown into the water by locals Barry, and Larry Boudreaux before getting eaten by a pilosaurus, an aquatic reptile thought to be extinct. As she runs back to warn Matt, and Mandy, she finds that Barry, and Larry have knocked Matt unconscious, and taken Mandy hostage before Laura herself is knocked unconscious by Larry.The next morning, Laura, Matt, and Mandy are reported as missing, and Laura's ex-boyfriend, Sheriff Tim Richards, and his younger brother Deputy Henry are sent to investigate. After coming up short, Tim interrogates Charles as to why he's buying the wetland, although after getting little information, he instead decides to investigate the length of the wetlands along with local Froggy on a small motorboat in order to find Laura. Meanwhile, Laura, Matt, and Mandy are tied up in Barry, and Larry's cabin, which is lined with explosives. Barry, and Larry take out Matt to be fed to the pilosaurus while Henry encounters Charles after finding a jaw belonging to a large creature.

Laura realizes that he was going to buy the wetland so he could use it as a place to keep the pilosaurus, which he has cloned, although he needs Pappy to sign the papers to give him the wetland. After Charles finds out that Barry, and Larry killed Pappy, he instead puts a sonar device in the water that attracts the pilosaurus, and forces Laura to sign it; otherwise he'll feed Henry to the pilosaurus. Laura signs the papers, and Charles leaves, although Mandy creates a distraction by detonating the explosives, and destroying the cabin while Laura stabs Larry in the eye with a pen, allowing her, Mandy, and Henry to escape as Larry is eaten by the pilosaurus.Barry gives chase, and manages to shoot Henry in the leg, although they manage to reach Laura's boat nonetheless. However, the pilosaurus destroys the boat, and the group is forced to hide as Henry bleeds out. The next morning, Henry dies from his wounds, and Laura, and Mandy run off to find help.

Froggy calls Charles to tell him that both of the girls are captured, and Charles tells Froggy to kill Barry due to his incompetence. Froggy kills Barry, and begins to drive the girls to another cabin in his truck. Along the way, he reveals that his motivation for helping Charles is that Pappy had slept with his mother, and that he is actually Laura's half-brother. After being rejected by Pappy, he decided to help Charles.Tim wanders over to the cabin that Froggy is taking Laura, and Mandy to, right before Froggy arrives with Laura, and Mandy. Tim ends up causing them to crash into the cabin, and Froggy is impaled by a wooden beam. He tells Tim, Laura, and Mandy to run as he's killed in a resulting gas explosion. The three drive back to the building where the wetland tours start, and they find the nest there, as well as the sonar device. Charles soon arrives, and takes Mandy hostage before throwing her into the water as the pilosaurus arrives. Tim disarms Charles, and throws him in as well, and the pilosaurus eats Charles as Tim, and Laura rescue Mandy. The pilosaurus attacks them on land, although Laura's mother Lefty arrives, and throws dynamite into the pilosaurus' moth, killing it.

Harry and Beth wanted a different kind of holiday. So they chartered a boat to drop them off on a remote coral island on the Great Barrier Reef. Paradise? The island was idyllic, surrounded by a wide reef, covered in palms and full of birds and other wildlife. It was small and totally deserted. Or was it? After snorkelling, making out and having fun, the young lovers soon come to believe that there is someone else on the island.

After an incident with two weird foreigners, the couple finds that a woman called Coral (Tasia Zalar) was raped and murdered one hundred years ago in that island and her ghost feels an intense hatred for men.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Marine biology student Beth and Harry are a young couple seeking a distinctive holiday trip, and they spend ten days on a deserted and idyllic coral island on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, recording many of their adventures with a camcorder. The first two days manifest that they are not alone and the island has a disturbing history. Haunted by a presence, they find an abandoned grave next to an old shack, the latter which has an old drawing and seven tally marks inside on the wall. When Beth and Harry sift through their camera, they discover they were filmed sleeping. Alarmed, Beth wants to leave, but Harry intends to stay, believing kids are playing pranks. They sight fishermen on a boat with guns and later realize that the grave has been remodeled, now decorated with red coral, with a wooden cross embedded at the head of the grave that reads ""Coral"" on it.The following day, Beth and Harry find severed sea cucumbers (trepang) hanging from a nearby line. By this episode, they realize they are in trouble and their phone, which they plan to use to call for rescue, goes missing. Searching for the phone, they come across Spiro (Billy Milionis) and Elias (Terry Siourounis), the two lunatic Greek fishermen they had seen the day before. This leads to Beth and Harry being tied up after snooping around their space and boat, accusing them of stealing their phone. Beth is sexually molested, but a female ghost appears and injures one man, as the fishermen flee from the island on their boat, and Harry and Beth manage to free themselves.The next day, Beth reads an old journal left behind in the shack. She learns the ghost is a girl named Coral (Tasia Zalar), a young island girl who worked for a company, harvesting sea cucumbers in the 1920s. Treading on a venomous stone fish, she became an object of ridicule and was raped by seven men from the company. Ever since her death, her soul seeks vengeance against all men who visit the island. Beth is wrapped up in the story that Harry initially believes to be a hoax, and Beth admits she would do the same as Coral if she was the victim. Realizing they're in grave danger, the next day they plan to create a bonfire in the hopes a rescue team finds them. However, a ringing phone brings Harry alone to the shack and he encounters Coral, who kills him with a knife and hangs his naked body in a tree above her grave. As night falls, Beth finds his hanging corpse dripping blood onto the grave and faints.The next morning, Beth recovers to find all trace of Harry's body gone-but one of the graves near the campsite has been filled in. While lighting the bonfire, she sees Coral standing on the reef.

A menacing Beth confronts and presumably kills him. One of the final scenes show Beth's grave next to Coral's, appearing as if they joined forces."

Magne tells that they can now ignore attempts to get to the sheriff they hiked the previous day, who is pitching pennies and listening to radio while waiting for the group where he dropped them off the previous day. While playing his war-game, Simen senses motion in the forest and is hearing branches breaking. Simen aims his gun towards the source of the noise before he hears it a second time. Simen asks if there are someone there, and then spots a hooded, humanoid creature. While aiming at the hooded man, he suddenly charges on Simen, who in fear of being in mortal danger tries to shoot the attacker. The gunfire is audible from a long distance, and is heard by the sheriff waiting for them. Meanwhile, Magne is casually walking through the woods while listening to Kim Wilde's ""Keep Me Hangin' On"", during which the music dies and he discovers that the tape did not wind up properly and jammed the Walkman. Hedda, who is enraged by Simen's shooting, rushes to Simen's location to reprimand him about the incident, but finds him sitting next to a tree while holding to his gun while being unresponsive. Upon looking closer, Hedda finds traces of blood at Simen's head and when she touches his head, it falls forward, revealing a branch impaling it. Hedda, clearly shocked by finding that someone has killed Simen, then noticing motion in the forest.Meanwhile, Magne has wound up the tape and starts playing it again, only for the music to die a second time. As Magne winds up the tape, Hedda suddenly runs into him, telling him to run. The pair reaches Anders, who is packing stuff to prepare for departure, and tells Anders to run. Anders hesitates until he spots someone moving between the trees before joining Hedda and Magne on the run. They trip in branches as they run to escape the killer. They reaches an abandoned house, where they hide in the basement. When Magne asks what is happening, Hedda tells that she found Simen dead, sitting next to a tree, and that the killer started going after her. They then hear someone enter the house, obviously the killer.Meanwhile, Einar goes to Jon's house to search for the missing youngsters. When he tries to make contact with Jon, he appears to not be at home. Siri, who is imprisoned in Jon's basement, hears the voice calling for Jon and recognize that it is Einar. She calls for help, but Jon, who is just pretending to not be at home, restrains Siri and tells her to shut up. Siri's call for help is not audible enough for Einar, who goes to inspect the shed a second time. There, he finds a dead and skinned deer, hunting equipment and traces of blood. Unable to find Jon and suspecting him of illegal hunting, Einar leaves Jon's property and heads back to the sheriff's office. Jon tells Siri that everything will be okay, while Jon tries to have sex with Siri, clearly against her will. On his way back, Einar calls the sheriff's office, telling that Jon was not at home.Back in the abandoned house, Magne exits the basement, and once out he sees the killer entering. He hides into another room, and the killer goes up to the second floor. Magne then tell Anders and Hedda that escape is safe. As they prepare to escape, Magne accidentally drops the trapdoor, forcing them to rush out with the killer in their heels. The killer breaks through the door and tries to break Magne's neck while Hedda finds a rotten wood plank she uses to hit the killer, forcing him to release Magne. In fear, they run from the house and through the forest. They reach a river, which they are forced to cross.Anders makes an attempt to cross the river while battling the tough water stream. He reaches the other side and tells Magne and Hedda to come, just as Anders is shot with an arrow in the torso, causing him to fall into the water, but he survives. Magne then follows, and the killer attempts to shoot Hedda as well. Another arrow hits Magne in the foot. Hedda then jumps into the water in an attempt to escape. The swim across and along the river while the killer keeps shooting arrows at them. After being dragged in the river, Hedda climbs up to the river bank. Exhausted, she finds Anders lying in the water. She drags him up and he is coughing water, suggesting he was close to drowning. At a different location, Magne has reached the river bank, and tries to pull the arrow out of his foot, despite having great pain. Hedda finds a hiding spot for Anders before looking for Magne.Meanwhile, Einar, who is unaware that two on the group are killed, one is held captive by his hermit brother Jon and the other three are on the run from their killer, searches through the woods to look for the missing youngsters, but finds just a Walkman and an audio cassette. Magne struggles through the woods while Hedda cares for Anders in a hiding location. Hedda then leaves Anders to go look for Magne, promising to be back. Magne, still lost in the woods, finds a car and recognizes it as the Sheriff's car. Inside, he tries to call with the sheriff's mobile phone, but unable to get it to work, he tries to get the car's engine running without keys. However, he end up turning on the lights and then the police siren. The sound of the police siren is heard by Anders and Hedda as well as Einar, who is still looking for them. Magne manages to turn the siren off before trying to turn the lights on again. The first time as the light flashes, Magne sees a man in the woods. He gets the light on once again, and notices that the man is gone. As he tries to start the engine, he attacked by the man he spotted earlier. Simultaniousley, Hedda turns up a,d hides under the car, only to watch Magne being stabbed by the killer.In Jon's basement, Siri manages to ungag herself and break free from her restraints. Einar returns to his car, and finds that someone has tampered with the electrical equipment. He calls the Sheriff's office, telling that he did not find Jon or the youngsters. Just a Walkman. Hedda sees Einar driving off and shouts to him to stop, which is in vain.Back in Jon's basement, Siri finds a matchbox and lights a match to get light. She notices a picture of the boy who went missing 12 years earlier together with his parents, shot outside the Stehøe mountain hotel. In addition, she finds a drawing depicting a man and a woman being brutally killed. She also finds a casket containing just a single wedding ring. She notices electric lights being lit and someone entering the basement. The man entering is dragging a human corpse behind him, who Siri recognize is Magne. Horrified, she watches as the man, who have killed and hunted down her other friends, hangs Magne's body upside down. He exits the room and when Siri attempts to make contact with him, she realizes that he is not alive. The killer enters once again, this time carrying a large knife. Then Jon is heard entering, who confront the killer he is harboring about that he has killed another person. Siri hears that Jon is ordering the killer to find the other two. After Jon leaves, the killer slits Magne open, shocking Siri, who is watching.Hedda and Anders are still hiding in the woods. Hedda finds a hiding place for Anders, however, a stream of water hits Anders' wound, causing him to scream loud. At a secluded location, Hedda manages to extract the arrow tip from Anders' body, despite him screaming in pain. Soon after, they hear the sounds of stones falling down and Anders realizes that the killer is tracking them. Anders tells Hedda to leave, realizing his limited ability to escape, but Hedda tells Anders that she will not leave him and persuades him to leave together with her. The killer approaches Anders, who is still severely injured. Just then Hedda appears behind the killer, who turns to face Hedda, who uses a screwdriver recovered from the sheriff's car to stab the killer in the stomach. But stabbing the killer turns out to be insufficient to immobilize the killer, who now tries to drown Hedda. Meanwhile Anders regains consciousness and uses a rock to strike the killer's head. Thinking that the killer is dead, Hedda and Anders escapes. However, the killer is not dead, and raises his head above the water surface, trying to expel water that has entered his lungs.At his office. Einar is in a phone-call about the missing youngsters, and tells the person in the other end to call again if he hears more news. Then, Einar remembers telling Jon that the area he lived in was a national park and hunting was illegal after discovering guns on the loading area on Jon's pickup truck, as well as Jon looking at Siri and the others inside the police car. He remembers the finding of dead animals and blood in Jon's shed. With that in mind, he opens the the archive containing cases on missing and wanted persons and cold-cases. In one cold-case file, he finds a news article about a team of hunters who found their dog skinned and an article about a farmer who found his sheep killed in a trapping pit, both happened near Stehøe mountain hotel. Einar then remembers seeing a bloody knife on the table in Jon's house when asking Jon if the missing kid was in Jon's house. He also remembers seeing a wet sweater lying on a table, and finds that its pattern is similar to the one of the missing boy after comparing it to a picture of the boy with his family.Meanwhile, Anders and Hedda reaches Jon,s house. Hedda knocks on the door, while Anders enters the driver's cab of Jon's pickup. Jon comes out and Hedda tells him that they must call for help and call the police. Jon tells Hedda that she can come in, but Anders have to remain outside. As Hedda enters, Jon shuts the door behind them. Inside, Hedda tries to call the police, but finds it not working. Jon re-enters and Hedda starts to become suspicious about his true intentions. Jon then attempts to grab a shotgun, but Hedda gets it and holds Jon at gunpoint. She then shouts to Anders to enter, telling him that Jon tried to get the shotgun. Hedda hands the shotgun to Anders and tells him to watch for Jon while Hedda goes down to the basement. After searching the basement, she finds a door. When trying to find out if someone is inside, she is responded by a female voice, which she recognizes as Siri's voice. She unlocks the door and enters the basement.As Siri and Hedda emerges from the basement, the killer suddenly enters the house and stabs Siri to death with the screwdriver Hedda stabbed him with earlier. Jon then takes the shotgun and aims it at the killer, telling him that he can nothing, and that he should instead have left him to freeze to death in the snow 12 years earlier. But before Jon can finish a sentence, the killer grabs the shotgun and shoots Jon in the torso. Hedda and Anders then escapes to the basement while the killer tries to shoot them, but misses. They barricade themselves inside the room Jon used to imprison Siri. As the killer attempts to break in, Anders tries to withhold the door while Hedda tries to open the window. But when trying to impale the door, Hedda pours gasoline next to the door and sets it on fire, causing the killer to back off from the door while screaming in pain. Anders manages to get the window open and climbs out, but the killer appears and impales Anders with a crowbar. As Hedda tries to escape the burning basement, she grabs a shovel to use as a weapon. In the ground floor, Jon is coughing blood, mortally injured from being shot by the man, who was the boy that disappeared 12 years earlier. She goes out and sees the killer standing outside. As she goes in, the killer also enters. She then hits the killer in the torso, causing him to fall. Jon then extracts shells from a box of shotgun shells as he finally dies. Hedda then grabs the shotgun and two shells from Jon's hands, and reloads the shotgun. She then sees someone entering the room, and thinking it is the killer, she aims the shotgun at the man, who turns out to be the sheriff that transported them 3 days earlier, and who aims a rifle at Hedda, telling her to put down the gun. While lowering the shotgun, Hedda tells Einar that the killer has killed everyone. The killer then reappears behind Einar, and Hedda rises the shotgun to shoot the killer. Einar, fearing he might get shot, shoots Hedda dead. As the killer leaves, Einar tries to stop Hedda's wound from bleeding, which is in vain. He then carries the bodies of Hedda, Jon and Siri outside as snow starts to fall. In the wintery mountains, the killer returns to the hotel which his mother and stepfather ran until 1976. Lights are then seen being lit inside the hotel corridors."

Gilles, his guardian at this halfway house, sees potential for redemption in this kid driven by violence. From a broken home - his parents, Luc Lebeau and Sonia Leblanc, both with substance abuse issues and who are no longer together - and living within the foster care system, ten year old Tommy Leblanc is sent to Springboard, a juvenile detention and rehabilitation center, following what is only the latest troubling incident in his long troubled life. Each boy at Springboard is assigned an educator - Tommy's being Gilles Séguin - for dedicated attention.

Those tantrums can be ignited by the smallest provocation. Gilles often feels at a loss as besides only scant information about Tommy's parents, he knows nothing about Tommy's past, with Luc, the only parent whose whereabouts are known, seems to be unwilling to be a part of Tommy's life in any form. In taking Tommy to the facility psychiatrist Dr. Michèle Bergeron, Gilles questions her approach in dealing with Tommy, especially as Tommy being at the facility is already taking its toll on him and the rest of the staff, with Dr. Bergeron's recommendation adding an extra level of dedicated attention and possible disruption, possibly negatively affecting the care of the other boys. If Gilles is unable to get through to Tommy using Dr. Bergeron's approach, Tommy may face a life from which there is no turning back to hope.—Huggo"

The Invisible Eye,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1313254/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Spying on her students, a teacher finds an exciting hobby. Buenos Aires, March 1982. On the streets of the Argentinean capital, people are challenging the military dictatorship. The walls of the school are thick and redoubtable. A secure promise of the guaranteed preservation of the good old days of school routine from anything that may happen outside its walls in the neighbouring streets, in Buenos Aires itself, in the Argentina of 1982. María Teresa is a classroom assistant at that school, an innocent - or maybe just ignorant - mistress of ceremonies, a bystander. She is twenty years old. She started work when it was still summer and Mr. Biasutto, the chief classroom assistant, made quite clear to her at her first interview the sort of attitude she is expected to adopt with students because it would not be an easy task to arrive at what he called 'the optimum surveillance point': Always on the 'qui vive', never missing a thing, but never giving cause for alarm amongst the students. A surveillance which would pick up on everything but would never be picked up on itself. A fleeting look on the face of the pervert, or the warden, or maybe the master. But if everything is out of order -even for her-, everything is transgression. And when María Teresa, hot on the trail of the merest, possibly imaginary wisp of tobacco smoke, starts hiding in the boys lavatories to catch smokers in flagrante delicto and haul them up before the authorities, slowly morphing the whole procedure into a clandestine habit of dubious piquancy; not exactly breaking the rules but bending them willy nilly, twisting, diverting them come what may but, of course, with utter correctness and obeisance to a surveillance emanating from the inflexible custodianship of a complete and atrocious normality. Surveillance, custodianship that could possibly be enforced beyond the boundaries of this enclosed world, because beyond the sheer masonry encasing this school, where the future ruling classes have studied and are studying, there is another world, there is an entire country that has virtually nothing to do with it.—Diego Lerman"

Por el camino, todo es miseria, como un hombre, Doroteo (José Chaves), que tuvo que hacer a su mujer una cesárea casera con un cuchillo de caza. Ceferino le dice que fornique menos y trabaje más. Mientras siguen su camino, una niña a la que apodan Pizquilla (Dafne Fernández), hace gestos de que tiene hambre. Ella y Marco se miran fijamente, pero Marco no puede hacer nada.Al principio, Atanasio (Sancho Gracia) no quiere ni hablar al crío, pero con el tiempo, le enseña remedios tradicionales, a cazar conejos, a lidiar con lobos. Atanasio acoge a tres fugitivos. Son maquis que ahora sobreviven como criminales. La guardia civil y un señorito han puesto precio a su cabeza, y Ceferino está obsesionado con cobrar la recompensa.

Pizquilla dirige a la partida a la zona de lobos - es una noche con niebla y luna llena, y Pizquilla, aunque no sabe seguro si el Balilla está allí, tiene la esperanza de que los lobos acaben con el cruel Ceferino. De hecho, Ceferino va solo a buscar al Balilla, deseando ser el único que puede reclamar la recompensa. Por eso está solo cuando el caballo siente a los lobos, se encabrita y lo tira al suelo. Los lobos lo atacan como Atanasio había explicado a Marcos que los lobos hacían esas cosas: dando vueltas a su alrededor para que crezca el pánico hasta que saltan a la víctima a la yugular.El sargento de la guardia civil arrastra a Marcos atado al caballo. Evidentemente, Ceferino no aparece, y Marcos sabe que los lobos acabaron con él. El lobo amigo aulla y se despide de él.2010 años después, en Sierra Morena, Marcos (Marcos Rodríguez Pantoja) anda en bici con un rifle a la espalda. Aún se lleva bien con los lobos."

He wants to change his image from Ari Pranchi to something great and is ready to spend a fortune for it. The film deals with how Pranchi tries to get a good name and what changes that brings to his life.The story starts with Francis talking to Saint Francis of Assisi about his own life. It starts with a short flashback about a quarrel between Francis and Jose (Siddique) over their lady love Omana (Khushbu Sundar) when they were in school. Francis had a romance going with Omana but he had to give her up because of Jose's tricks. Now Jose and Omana are apparently happily married and are leading doctors in the city.The story progresses with several anecdotes about Francis' attempts to get a good name for himself. These attempts are always told to him by his friend Vasu Menon (Innocent), who always takes him to problems. He fights a local club election for the place of the club's President but is defeated by Jose. He then arranges a felicitation for the Oscar award-winner Gafoor Chekutty (a spoof of Resul Pookutty), but has to be satisfied with only a back row seat as he had to give up his seat on the dais for a Padmashree recipient. Inspired by the recognition and respect given to a Padmashree recipient, he decides to somehow grab such an award as that may help in changing his name from Ari Pranchi to Padmashree Pranchi. He bribes a politician named Ajay Nambiar (Balachandran Chullikkadu) with Rs 15 million to get the award, but the corrupt politician dupes him.Dejected, he withdraws into his house when a young woman named Padmashree (Priyamani) comes from Mumbai to invite him for an inauguration ceremony. Following an initial altercation with her due to his misunderstanding of her intention, both become good friends and eventually, Francis falls in love with her. He also helps to prevent her tharavadu (ancestral home) from being sold off. However, he is unable to express his love for her and she returns to Mumbai.During an interaction with his friend Antony (Sivaji Guruvayoor), who is the principal of the local school, he narrates his woe to Francis. He fears that he might not be able to retire with the satisfaction of having presided over a school that got a pass rate of 100% in the SSLC exams. Moved, Francis resolves to help him. He quickly learns that the problem lies with a sole student named Pauly K. J.(Ganapathy), who always fails in the exams. Pauly's dad (Sreejith Ravi) says they are not financially sound and hence cannot help him enough with his studies. So, he brings the boy to his home and arranges for a special tutor, Pandit Deenadayal (Jagathy Sreekumar), to teach him. Deenadayal discovers that the boy is smart and immensely intelligent, but something is holding him back. He tries to teach Pauly to the best of his ability but, the boy's wit proves too much for him.Pauly fails the exam again. Furious, Francis throws him out of his house. Upon learning that Pauly's parents were just his foster parents, he and Pauly go to see Pauly's biological father, Joppan (Biju Menon), who is in prison serving a life sentence. Francis comes to know that Joppan, under the influence of alcohol and drugs, hacked his wife (Pauly's mother) and Pauly's teacher to death in front of Pauly. Francis concludes that this incident psychologically scarred the boy, which caused his academic performance to tank. The jail warden (Chaali Pala) discloses to Francis that Joppan is suffering from terminal liver cancer, and he deliberately hides it from the boy so as to not cause him further distress.Francis then goes to the church in his car. While Pauly sleeps in the car, he talks to Saint Francis. He asks for the Saint's permission for him to adopt Pauly. Fearing failure, he asks the Saint to permit him only if he will succeed. The Saint then shows Francis 3 visuals. The first shows his lost love Omana and Jose cheating on each other. In the second, Ajay Nambiar, the man who cheated him by offering the Padmashree for a bribe is arrested by the police. In the third, Padmashree openly admits her love for Francis to her friend in Mumbai, and further discloses that she is going to propose to him. The Saint then tells him that what one sees as a success is not always a success and what one has lost can always come back to him in the future. Happy, Francis asks the Saint to bless Pauly. But when he returns with the boy, they find the place empty. An incredulous Pauly dismisses Francis' encounter with the Saint as make believe, but when Francis avers that he asked for and got the Saint's permission to adopt Pauly, he says that he too has seen the saint in human form, as Francis.

All is hunky dory till they are forced to shut shop until a plan comes up. BADMAASH COMPANY is a story set in the 1990s, of four ordinary middle-class Bombay youngsters - Karan (Shahid Kapoor), Bulbul (Anushka Sharma), Zing (Meiyang Chang) and Chandu (Vir Das) - who came together to start an import business. With their larger than life schemes, the four go on a wild roller-coaster ride into the world of sheer glitz and glamour where the stakes are high and risks even higher.—Official Source In 1994 middle-class Bombay, three ordinary youngsters, Karan (Shahid Kapoor), Zing (Meiyang Chang) and Chandu (Vir Das) graduate from college and go for a trip to Bangkok, Thailand (they were sent on a paid trip by Archie Bhai (Jameel Khan), as currency couriers. Archie will use the currency in Bangkok to buy imported stuff, which he will bring to India vi the boys and sell for a huge profit), where they meet Bulbul (Anushka Sharma) (who is also carrying currency for Archie) and they start a business together.Karan eventually falls in love with her. Karan tells her that he always wanted to start his own business but his father Sajjan Kapoor (Anupam Kher) wants him to study MBA. On the other hand, Bulbul confesses that she wants to be a supermodel and advises Karan that he does not need a large amount of money to start a business, but a big ""idea"". Back in India, Sajjan has a heart attack. Karan's mother Maya (Kiran Juneja) pawns her jewelry in order to arrange some amount of money for better facilities and an AC room at the hospital as his insurance could only afford a Non-AC room. This leaves Karan heart-broken, and he immediately decides to get rich by any means, he decides to start his own venture along with his friends.He comes up with an idea (Bulbul joins Karan when a client offers her a 5 yr contract, but wants to have sex with her in return) for smuggling branded Reebok shoes in India without any customs charges (which amount to 120%). He borrows money from Jazz Mamu, who stays in the US and is rich. For this, they have to separate the consignment into two-halves, one half with only left shoes in Calcutta and the other half with only right shoes in Madras. At both places, the buyer (which they are themselves) will refuse to receive the consignment, hence the entire consignment will be confiscated. The confiscated consignment will then be auctioned in which Chandu (in Calcutta) and Karan (in Madras) will buy the entire consignment, pretending they are scrap dealers. Once the right shoes pair up with left shoes, the zero-valued product comes into a full value which can be sold at any profit without any customs charges.
He sells the entire consignment to Archie Bhai for a fat profit (rs 10 Lakhs).They name their venture ""Friends and Company"" and proceed to make a large fortune with it. When Karan is caught red-handed by Sajjan while putting away the black money, he explains the situation, including the fact that he is doing business with a smuggler. As a result, he is forced to leave the house and starts living with Bulbul and uses her to get contracts. After the government in India decides to reduce the import duty on foreign goods (including shoes), the friends decide to go to America. They get help from Karan's Uncle Jazz (Pavan Malhotra.)They do the same business in the US as they did in India, only this time they import Leather Gloves. They import leather gloves on consignment at really low costs and con prospective buyers by accepting payment on delivery and deliver only the right hand or the left handed gloves. Then they buy back the gloves from the buyer at throwaway prices and reunite the pairs. Then they sell the same pairs to the same buyer at a higher price (since by now they are in desperate need of inventory)..In a short time, the group becomes excessively rich and starts to live royally. The police start to suspect Karan and his team, owing to which they change their business.
Instead, one of the friends rents a lavish house for one hundred thousand dollars by taking a loan from a bank. Then the house will be sold to another friend and again that friend will take a loan from the same bank, hence repeating the cycle. Since the property of the person who cannot return the loan is used to be seized by the bank, one of them will declare thyself as bankrupt and the house gets seized, with an actual worth of one hundred thousand dollars, but the company will have already gained two hundred thousand dollars' profit. However, Karan becomes too greedy and the group begins to fall apart. Zing hits his Caucasian girlfriend. Karan ignores Bulbul when he has dinner with potential investors.Karan and Zing get into an argument about Zing's excessive drinking. Karan says Zing embarrasses the group and Zing gets offended and says Karan was a street rat and is acting all pricey now. Zing leaves and opens his own bar. Bulbul leaves when she finds out that Karan has married another woman for a green card. Chandu weds and quits the company to start a video store. Karan is angry that his friends have abandoned him after getting rich.Alone and heartbroken, Karan visits India and secretly attends a function where Sajjan is being honored for his years of service to his company. Upon seeing this, he realizes his mistake. On his return to America, he is arrested and put in jail for 6 months. He is bailed out after Bulbul comes and gives up Zing's, Chandu's and her share from what they earned in the company. Karan starts working with his uncle. One day, he meets Bulbul, who is revealed to be pregnant with his child and the lovers reconcile.At Uncle Jazz's office, Karan finds out that his uncle's entire consignment of imported shirts from Madras has been rejected as the color bleeds after washing. The news reaches to stock market due to which Jazz company's share fall down to 30%. Karan sees an opportunity and thinks of another brilliant idea and Karan patches up with Zing, Chandu and his family to start another new venture. They buy Jazz's company stock which is now down 40%.This time, he makes Jazz's buyers believe that his company offers a new kind of shirt in the market, which changes its color every time it is washed, hence a common man gets a new shirt every time he washes it. The buyers' orders a trial order of 5,000 pieces and the public goes crazy over this new shirt (After Chandu gets his Caucasian girlfriend to get Michael Jackson to wear the shirt at his concert), due to which Karan gets another order, this time for a much bigger amount of shirts. The shares of Jazz's company go skyrocketed as the public really appreciates and buys the shirts at an overwhelmingly high rate, hence recovering his Uncle Jazz' loss. Karan, Zing, Chandu, and Bulbul are now partners with Jazz in ""Friends and Company"", but it is turned into a public limited company. With his wife, son, friends and having made his father proud, Karan is finally content with his life."

The Lamp,2010,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754648/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A couple's marriage has fallen apart after the death of their son, until a mysterious stranger presents them with a magical lamp and three wishes to put things right. However, they must choose very carefully what they ask for. Suffering from the loss of his only child, Stanley has secluded himself to a dark and lonely place. Sullen and without hope, he continues to hide from and neglect those he loves despite their attempts to reach out to him. In what seems to be the final days of their already strained marriage, his wife Lisa is presented with a strange gift; an old oil lamp from a far off land. Along with the lamp comes a mysterious messenger and and a question that causes them to search the depths of their hearts for what's truly important in life... If you could have anything you wanted, what would YOU ask for?—Joe Jestus Two years after losing their son Eddy (Greyson Moore), father Stanley (Jason London) cannot seem to live a normal life. His wife Lisa (Meredith Salenger) finally tells him it is okay to ""move on"" with their life. (Eddy was a budding baseball prodigy, in his young life, and his father coached his team.) Stanley has been sleeping in Eddy's room. When he finds that Lisa has taken some of Eddy's clothing for a fundraising sale he explodes and claims that she had no right to sell HIS son's memories to ""the highest bidder"".
At the garage sale, the grieving parents' neighbor, a foster-care mother, Miss Esther (L.Scott Caldwell) offers an old oil lamp. She says it has given her what she needed and now it is time to find a new owner. At the end of the day, the lamp has not been bought. Lisa tries to return it to Miss Esther, who tells her that ""of course"" it wasn't bought, because it needed to find ""the right owner"". Miss Esther then suggests (perhaps) it is her, and gently shuts the door, leaving Lisa holding the lamp.
The argument regarding Lisa taking Eddy's old clothes to the sale occurs after this. After the ""highest bidder"" comment, Stanley sneers at Lisa and the lamp and says ""and you brought home THIS?"" (I assume as a replacement, in his mind). He leaves, enraged.
The next thing memorable, is Stanley being gone, and Lisa in the house as a knock on the door sounds. Enter Charles Montgomery, Jr. III (Louis Gossett, Jr.)..Unwilling to open the door to a stranger, he slips his card under the door. It simply says BELIEVE in ornate script with his name underneath. Lisa then opens the door to him and as he is seated, things happen that amaze her, especially when he simply disappears as Stanley comes in.
A seemingly obscure Maintenance worker named Sam (Muse Watson) was...if you looked closely...watching Stanley at Eddy's funeral...he is a key character, though you wouldn't know, in the beginning.
When I first saw this, I did not realize (at first) that Josh (Cameron Ten Napel) and Rachel (Katie Burgess) were sisters. I had thought that Rachel was the child whom would be instrumental in helping Stanley to heal.
Enough Spoilers and Details...this movie is worth watching. For anyone whom has suffered a loss (my prayers), this is a movie of hope, redemption, salvation and renewal-of spirit. No more Details!"

Rahul Prakash Udyavar joins Saraswati Vidya Mandir, which is located in Mumbai's Eastern suburbs, as an English teacher. Shortly thereafter he also agrees to teach music at the request of nutritionist Anjali Mathur. With the school facing shortage of funds, pressure is being brought by Manager Lallan Sharma to try to get students' parents to pay more for a variety of activities. When the Principal, Aditya Sahay, supports Lallan, the students and staff are forced to raise funds. Despite their best efforts, however, the stage is set for a much-publicized confrontation that could result in the closure of this institution.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Teaching is a noble profession.But does it hold true today? Hasn't education succumbed to modernization as everything else, which is ruled by commercialization and consumerism in this age of rat-race? We read in the newspapers about students being bogged down under study pressures, parents burdened with fees hikes, teachers punishing students inhumanly, some students even dying in such cases or some committing suicides... what state of affairs have we brought our education system to? Paathshaala tries to answer many such questions related to the sanctity of today's education system. It sheds light on the shortcomings and wrong doings in today's schools where the high morals and basic ethics associated with the teaching profession seem to have taken a back seat. It's shameful that even schooling has fallen prey to the pressures of competition and the vices of money-making mantra. Paathshaala attempts to challenge such notions that threaten our children's future and thus our society.The story begins with a new English Teacher Rahul Prakash Udyavar (Shahid Kapoor) joining Swaraswati Vidya Mandir school, situated in the outskirts of Mumbai Suburbs. Though he strikes instant rapport with students and teachers alike, he realizes that there is something amiss in the school. Slowly his doubts prove true as the School Manager- Sharma (Saurabh Shukla) makes many monetary obligations compulsory on the parents in the name of extracurricular activities. He goes to the extent of punishing the students inhumanly when the new unjustified demands of the school are not fulfilled by the parents.When Rahul Udyawar unifies the teachers (Ayesha Takia, Sushant Singh, Kurush Deboo) against the atrocities of school management, the Principal Aditya Sahay (Nana Patekar) defends the management decision. This comes as a shocker to the teachers as Mr. Sahay is known for his dedication as an educationist for last 32 years which has built the school's high reputation. The situation becomes graver as school management becomes overambitious with its growth and involves media planners in the extracurricular activities. This demands the involvement of students in TV reality shows and many other media PR activities used for building up the school image in public which starts reflecting on the students' stress levels. The pressure on young minds increases incredibly leading to unexpected and grim consequences.Caught in the web of commercialization and internal rebellion, the school's situation becomes so explosive that it finally becomes a national issue. Paathshaala challenges the increasing immoralities and unethical practices in our education system. It analyses intricately the relationship between students, teachers and the education system with sensitivity and sensibility... It reflects the true spirit of an education system.PAATHSHAALA - An Urgent and Desperate eye-opening Mission for our Education System today."

The film is also a humble tribute to Satyajit Ray's Nayak.—Anonymous Shubhabrata (Indraneil Sengupta), an ambitious but inexperienced filmmaker aims for success with his first venture into fiction, a remake ofSatyajit Ray'sNayak: The Hero (1966), replacing situations in the storyline with more contemporary ones, like the train journey with one by an airplane, and extends the ending of the original in his script. He makes several attempts to approach established star actor Arun Chatterjee (Prasenjit Chatterjee) to essay the hero's role (played byUttam Kumarin the original) but is continually spurned by Arun's associates Ashish (Pijush Ganguly) and Partha (Dwijen Banerjee).Over time, Arun receives a severe jolt to his ego caused by a public putdown from successful producer Manoj Sarkar (Biswajit Chakraborty) on a TV channel. He decides to take it upon himself as a challenge to unilaterally churn out a hit movie, gets to learn of Shubhabrata's script and summons him. Enthused by Shubhabrata's passion and determination, he decides to finance the movie himself, besides playing the lead, and arranging for its production, overruling Ashish and Partha's objections. The film appears to him the ideal platform to prove his ability to deliver a hit single-handedly.After scouring among a few actresses for the lead actress' role (played bySharmila Tagorein the Ray original), Shubhabrata decides to cast his live-in girlfriend Srinandita (Nandana Sen), Srin in short, an actress involved in translated European theatre, who he'd always had in mind while delineating the character in his script. After initial reservations, Srinandita agrees.Manoj comes to learn of the launch of the film and apporaches Shubhabrata with an offer to help out in case Arun subsequently falls out with Shubhabrata for some reason and decides to shelve the film, but is dismissed.While shooting progresses, Shubhabrata encourages the growing bonding between Arun and Srin in the interest of authenticity in the film. At the same time, however, he himself grows both in confidence and arrogance towards his cast and crew.Now the narrative of the film's storyline begins playing out parallelly in real life where the friendship between Srin and Arun grows to the extent that she turns from his companion into confidante. In a climactic moment, after the last day's shooting is over, Arun invites himself into Srin and Shubhabrata's apartment in a drunken state while the latter is away and confesses to having used an aspiring actress on the casting couch. Srin consoles him saying that his feeling of guilt signifies repentance and holds the promise of redemption.Accidentally, the confession gets recorded on Srin's handycam who's been using it to rehearse for her next stage appearance as Antigone. When Shubhabrata, who has meanwhile been searching for novel ideas to publicize his film, learns of its existence upon his return, he sees a golden opportunity to use it as publicity material and decides to grab it with both hands. Srin is aghast at the suggestion and dissuades him, extracting a promise from him to refrain.However, Shubhabrata soon breaks his promise, steals the clip from Srin's possession unbeknown to her and passes it on to a TV news channel. When Srin learns of this, she leaves him for an uncertain career as drama teacher in a girls' school away from the city.The next day, the channel plays the clip repeatedly and when Arun switches on the TV, he chances upon the clip. He holds both Shubhabrata and Srin guilty of betrayal and when Srin calls him trying to explain and apologise, disconnects. Asish fails to convince him to take legal action against the channel and assault Shubhabrata.When he finally confronts Shubhabrata and learns of Srin's departure, he realises her innocence. However, he decides to cancel the film, and warns Shubhabrata of using his influence to finish his career, short of causing him physical harm.As a final denouement, Shubhabrata, though he is shown to have begun missing Srin, is seen fixing an appointment with Manoj.
