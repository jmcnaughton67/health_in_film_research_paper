Billy Jack,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066832/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ex-Green Beret hapkido expert saves wild horses from being slaughtered for dog food and helps protect a desert ""freedom school"" for runaway. Billy Jack is a half-Indian/half-white ex-Green Beret who is being drawn more and more toward his Indian side. He hates violence, but can't get away from it in the white man's world. Pitting the good guys, the students of the peace-loving free-arts school in the desert vs. the Democratic bad guys in the near-by town, the movie plays definitive late-60s themes/messages: anti-establishment, make love not war, the senseless slaughter of God's creatures, the rape of society (figuratively and literally), two-sided justice, racial segregation and prejudices.—Nic Cage <2cool@zebra.net> The half-breed Billy Jack lives in an Indian reservation protecting the Indians, the stallions and the students of the Freedom School, a peaceful art school run by Jean Roberts and where the students can choose their own destiny. When the teenage daughter of the corrupt Deputy Mike, Barbara, is retrieved by Sheriff Cole, she tells that she is pregnant and her father beats her up. Sheriff Cole and the local doctor ask Jean if she can lodge Barbara, she welcomes the traumatized teenager. But her father, together with the corrupt and powerful Mr. Stuart Posner and his coward son Bernard Posner, initiate a campaign to damage the school and humiliate the students while Billy Jack fight to control his temper against the bigotry and violence of the locals. But when he discovers what Bernard did to Jean, he has to use violence to defeat evil.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Set in the late 1960s, Billy Jack is a half-white, half-Indian ex-Green Beret Vietnam vet-turned-pacifist, and Hapkido expert (a combination of Tae Kwon Do and Aikido) who having gotten in touch with his Native American roots returns from the war to take up residence on a reservation outside a conservative Arizona town, where he quickly becomes the protector of the wild mustangs and the progressive Freedom School run by Jean Roberts, along with the Native Americans on the reservation.Along with Roberts and the pupils, Billy Jack has frequent altercations with local bigoted Sheriff Stuart Posner and his son, Bernard, as well as Deputy Sheriff Mike, whose pregnant 15-year-old Barbara had been found in Haight-Ashbury running away from her abusive father, and was brought home. When she arrives, she suffers yet another beating after telling her father what's going on, runs away again, and is found asleep in a field by Billy Jack, who helps hide her at the Freedom School.At first Bernard Posner seems like a sympathetic character when he refuses to shoot any of the wild mustangs on the reservation to sell as dog food like his father wants him to, but after helping to cause much trouble for the Freedom School in the hopes of making his father proud of him by harassing female pupils and verbally and physically abusing other Freedom School pupils, especially the Native Americans; raping Roberts, and ultimately shooting and killing Martin, a gentle Native American who befriended Barbara and taught her that there are ways to gain love other than through easy sex, it's clear that Bernard deserves little or no sympathy, although he does admit to wanting to make his father proud despite hating him.Deputy Sheriff Mike, as well as the Posners and many if not most of the townspeople, hate both non-whites and peace-loving whites. The hatred and resentment grows as it becomes known that the Freedom School is not only open to at-risk kids of all racial/ethnic backgrounds, but is also an unconventional school with few rules.In the wake of Martin's murder, as well as the rape of Jean, despite Jean's warnings about the possible resulting dissolution of the Freedom School and harm to its pupils. Billy Jack hunts down Bernard Posner, finds him having sex with a 13-year-old in a shabby hotel room on the edge of town, and orders the girl to leave the premises. Bernard then tries to kill Billy Jack by shooting at him, and Billy Jack, in turn, kills Bernard with a karate chop across the throat.Billy Jack and Barbara hide from the law in an old church on the edge of town. A shootout between Billy Jack and the law ensues, in which Billy Jack shoots and kills Deputy Mike. Billy Jack, who suffers a gunshot wound to the stomach, stays in the church with Barbara, who is slightly wounded by gunfire. After hiding out in the church all night, Billy Jack finally surrenders to the law and gives himself up, under several conditions:A) That the Freedom School be allowed to run for the next ten years with no interference, with Jean Roberts beginning a ten-year contract as principalB) That Jean Roberts gets custody of Barbara and becomes Barbara's legal guardianC) That an annual press conference be held by the governor's office to report on the school's progressThe conditions are OK'd by Washington, and, after tearful hugs and goodbyes between him and Jean, Billy Jack allows himself to be handcuffed and taken out to be tried for the killings of Bernard Posner and Barbara's father, Mike. Meanwhile, the kids at the Freedom School gather outside to see Billy Jack off, giving the Black Power raised-fist and shedding tears."
Fiddler on the Roof,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067093/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In pre-revolutionary Russia, a Jewish peasant with traditional values contends with marrying off three of his daughters with modern romantic ideals while growing anti-Semitic sentiment threatens his village. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jews and Orthodox Christians live in the little village of Anatevka in the pre-revolutionary Russia of the Czars. Among the traditions of the Jewish community, the matchmaker arranges the match and the father approves it. The milkman Reb Tevye is a poor man that has been married for twenty-five years with Golde and they have five daughters. When the local matchmaker Yente arranges the match between his older daughter Tzeitel and the old widow butcher Lazar Wolf, Tevye agrees with the wedding. However Tzeitel is in love with the poor tailor Motel Kamzoil and they ask permission to Tevye to get married that he accepts to please his daughter. Then his second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) and the revolutionary student Perchik decide to marry each other and Tevye is forced to accept. When Perchik is arrested by the Czar troops and sent to Siberia, Hodel decides to leave her family and homeland and travel to Siberia to be with her beloved Perchik. When his third daughter Chava decides to get married with the Christian Fyedka, Tevye does not accept and considers that Chava has died. Meanwhile the Czar troops evict the Jewish community from Anatevka.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil It's pre-revolutionary Russia in the largely Jewish community of Anatevka, Ukraine, whose residents are ruled by community and cultural traditions. For poor dairy farmer, Tevye, and his wife, Golde, those traditions include getting the town matchmaker, Yente, to find their five daughters - the three oldest, Tzeitel, Hodel and Chava, who are barely of marrying age - suitable wealthy husbands, especially important since the girls will have no dowries. Tzeitel, not yet twenty, doesn't like that Yente only chooses old men. She is also in love with the poor tailor, Motel. Motel doesn't believe Tevye would approve of a union between himself and Tzeitel because of Motel's poor socioeconomic state, and without someone arranging the union. Hodel understands these traditions better than her elder sister, Hodel who has her sights on the rabbi's son, because of what he is, not because of who he is. Chava accepts her fate, marriage still being years away, but she hopes for someone she will love while she now focuses on her love of books. Change from those traditions is in the air, which is confirmed by Perchik, a young man, a student espousing Marxist ideals, recently arrived from Kyiv. This change may affect what happens matrimonially with Tzeitel, Hodel and Chava. But this change comes anti-Jewish sentiment sweeping across Europe, which may affect what happens to Tevye, his family, and the Jewish community in Anatevka as a whole.—Huggo Tevye (Topol), the philosophical village milkman, explains the customs of the Jewish people and their lives in the Russian shtetl of Anatevka in 1905, where life is as precarious as the perch of a fiddler on a roof (""Tradition""). At Tevye's home, everyone is busy preparing for the Sabbath meal. His sharp-tongued wife, Golde (Norma Crane), orders their five daughters, 19-year-old Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris), 17-year-old Hodel (Michele Marsh), 15-year-old Chava (Neva Small), 12-year-old Shprintze (Elaine Edwards), and 10-year-old Bielke (Candy Bonstein), about their tasks.Yente (Molly Picon), the village matchmaker, arrives with news for Golde. Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), the wealthy butcher, a widower of Tevye's age, wants to wed Tzeitel, their eldest daughter. Tevye must be persuaded to meet Lazar to arrange the marriage. The two middle daughters, Hodel and Chava, speculate excitedly about what their mother and the matchmaker were talking about, but Tzeitel warns them not be so hasty. They are poor, so their parents will have no choice but to take whatever husband Yente brings (""Matchmaker""). Tzeitel is not eager to have a match found for her, as she is already in love with the tailor, Motel Kamzoil (Leonard Frey), her friend since childhood.Tevye's horse is lame, and he must pull the milk cart himself. He asks God, who it would hurt ""If I Were a Rich Man?"" The men of the village confront Tevye, as he is late delivering their milk and cheese. Avram (Alfie Scopp), the bookseller, has news from the outside world about pogroms and expulsions. A student from Kiev, Perchik (Paul Michael Glaser), newly arrived in town, hears their conversation and scolds them for doing nothing more than talk. The men dismiss Perchik as a radical, but Tevye takes a liking to him and invites him home for the Sabbath meal, offering him room and board in exchange for tutoring his two youngest daughters. Golde tells Tevye to meet Lazar Wolf after the Sabbath but does not tell him why, knowing that Tevye does not like Lazar. Tzeitel is afraid that Yente will find her a husband before Motel asks Tevye for her hand. But Motel resists: he is shy and afraid of Tevye's temper, and Jewish tradition says that a matchmaker arranges marriages. Motel is also very poor and is saving up to buy a sewing machine before he approaches Tevye, to show that he can support a wife. The family gathers around for the ""Sabbath Prayer.""After the Sabbath, Tevye visits Lazar Wolf. Teyve assumes that Lazar wants to buy his milk cow. After the misunderstanding is cleared up, Tevye agrees to let Lazar marry Tzeitel. With a rich butcher, he knows that his daughter will never go hungry. The two go to Mordcha's inn to seal their agreement with a drink. Many of the villagers are there, including a group of non-Jews. All join in the celebration of Lazar's good fortune; even the Russian youths at the inn join in the celebration and show off their dancing skills (""To Life""). Outside the inn, Tevye bumps into the Russian Constable (Louis Zorich), who has jurisdiction over the Jews in the town. The Constable warns him that there is going to be a ""demonstration"" in the coming weeks (a euphemism for a minor pogrom). The Constable has sympathy for the Jewish community but is powerless to prevent the violence due to his loyalty to the Czar.The next morning, a hungover Tevye delivers the news to his family that he has agreed that Tzeitel will marry Lazar Wolf. Golde is overjoyed, but Tzeitel is horrified and pleads with Tevye to reconsider. Motel arrives and gathers the courage to tell Tevye that he and Tzeitel gave each other a pledge to marry. Tevye is outraged at this breach of tradition, but Motel argues that even a poor tailor is entitled to some happiness. Tevye is impressed when the once-timid young tailor stands up for himself and, moved by his daughter's earnestness, gives his assent (""Tevye's Monologue""); but he worries about how to break the news to Golde. An overjoyed Motel celebrates with Tzeitel (""Miracle of Miracles"").That night in bed with Golde, Tevye has an inspiration: he tells Golde that he has had a nightmare (""Tevye's Dream""). She offers to interpret his dream, and Tevye ""describes"" it. Golde's grandmother Tzeitel (for whom their daughter is named) returned from the grave to bless the marriage of her namesake, but to Motel, not to Lazar Wolf. Lazar's formidable wife, Fruma Sarah, also rises from her grave to warn, in graphic terms, of severe retribution if Tzeitel marries Lazar. Tevye's superstitious wife is terrified, and she quickly agrees that Tzeitel must marry Motel, much to Tevye's secret relief.On the road outside of town, Tevye's middle daughter, the bookish Chava, is teased and intimidated by some Russian youths, but one of them, Fyedka (Ray Lovelock), protects her, dismissing the others. He offers Chava the loan of a book, and a secret relationship begins.The wedding day of Tzeitel and Motel arrives, and all the Jews join the ceremony (""Sunrise, Sunset"") and the celebration (""The Wedding Dance""). Lazar gives a fine gift, but an argument arises with Tevye over the broken agreement. Perchik ends the tiff by breaking another tradition: he crosses the barrier between the men and women to dance with Tevye's daughter Hodel. The celebration ends abruptly when a group of Russians rides into the village to perform the ""demonstration."" They disrupt the party, damaging the wedding gifts and wounding Perchik, who attempts to fight back, and wreaking more destruction in the village. Ever practical, Tevye advises everyone to clean up the mess.Months later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kiev to work for the revolution. He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (""Now I Have Everything""). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After some soul searching, Tevye finally relents; the world is changing, and he must change with it (""Tevye's Rebuttal"").Tevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. ""Love,"" he says, ""it's the new style."" Tevye asks Golde, ""Do You Love Me?"" She admits that after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Other events are moving apace. Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka. News spreads quickly in Anatevka (""The Rumor""). Perchik has been arrested during a demonstration in Kiev and is being exiled to Siberia, and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved wherever he may be, yet she will always love her family (""Far from the Home I Love""). Hodel then leaves on the train while Tevye watches her leave.Meanwhile, Tzeitel and Motel become parents when their son is born, and the latter finally buys the sewing machine for which he has long scrimped and saved.Weeks pass, and Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka... a young Christian. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish faith is a line that he cannot cross. He forbids Chava ever to speak to Fyedka again. When Golde brings the news that Chava has eloped with Fyedka and they got married in a Russian Orthodox church, Tevye wonders where he went wrong (""Chava Sequence""). Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. In a soliloquy, Tevye concludes that he cannot accept Chava marrying a non-Jew. He accuses her of abandoning the Jewish faith and disowns her.Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians forcing Jewish villagers to leave their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about the miserable town, and how hard it will be to leave what has for so long been their home (""Anatevka"").Tevye, his family and friends begin packing up to leave, heading for various parts of Europe, Palestine, and the United States.Yente, the Matchmaker, plans to emigrate to Jerusalem, and says goodbye to Golde with an embrace before departing. Lazar plans to emigrate to Chicago, to live with his former brother in law, whom he detests, but ""a relative is a relative"". Lazar and Tevye share one last embrace before departing.Tevye receives a letter from Hodel mentioning that she is working hard in a large town in Siberia while Perchik stays in the Siberian prison. It is hoped that when Perchik is released, they will join the others in the United States.Chava and her husband Fyedka come to Tevye's house one last time and tell the family that they are leaving for Kraków in Galicia, being unable to stay in a place that would force innocent people out. Tevye shows signs of forgiving Chava by murmuring under his breath ""And God be with you"", silently urging Tzeitel to repeat his words to Chava. Golde calls out to Chava and Fyedka, telling them where they will be living in New York City with a relative.Motel and Tzeitel and their child go to Poland as well but will join the rest of the family when they have saved up enough money.The Constable and the Russian soldiers silently watches as the mass evacuation of Anatevka takes place. The community forms their circle at a crossroad one last time before scattering in different directions.In the final scene, Tevye, his wife Golde, and their two youngest daughters, Shprintze and Bielke, somberly walk down the desolate snowy road with Tevye pulling the cart with all their belongings in it. As Tevye stops for a short rest, he sees the fiddler behind them in the distance playing. Tevye motions to him to come along with him... symbolizing that even though he must leave his town, his Jewish traditions will always be with him."

And as the British secret agent assumes a new identity to sniff for clues, the dangerous mission takes Bond from mysterious Amsterdam to dazzling Las Vegas, unaware that a pair of stealthy assassins interested in the precious gems meticulously weed out the competition. More and more, everyone who becomes involved in the well-planned smuggling operation and touches those diamonds ends up dead. Who is the mastermind behind the deadly sinister plot?—Nick Riganas After travelling the world in his quest to kill Blofeld, Bond returns triumphantly, only to discover a case waiting for him: a large amount of diamonds has been stolen from the South African mines and two offbeat assassins are killing everyone in the smuggling ring one-by-one. Bond goes undercover as Peter Franks, diamond smuggler. What he discovers shocks him: the head of the smuggling ring is none other than Ernst Stavros Blofeld. Now, Bond must resist the wiles of a beautiful smuggler and survive the machinations of Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, Blofeld's two best assassins so that he can uncover Blofeld's sinister plot.—A Shady Government Operative When the British Government suspect the existence of a worldwide diamond smuggling operation, James Bond is called in to investigate. He soon discovers the extent of the problem and travels to America where a millionaire casino owner is suspected to be behind it all.

Especially when some of the world's most powerful weapons are involved, and two of the three stooges.—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> After the murder of his wife, James Bond (Sean Connery) is relentlessly pursuing Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray). After interrogating several of Blofeld's associates worldwide, Bond traces him to a facility where he is surgically creating lookalikes of himself. Bond kills a test subject who is lying in a mud bath. The man raises a pistol but Bond releases more mud, drowning the man. Blofeld walks in, pointing a pistol. After a fight, Bond kills Blofeld by throwing him into another mud pool.In a South African desert, two men, Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith), are observing a scorpion and talking about how deadly they are. Wint dons gloves and picks up the scorpion. A man arrives on a scooter; he is a dentist who smuggles diamonds from South African mines, retrieving them from his patients who hide them in their mouths. He has come to give Wint and Kidd a small load of them. Kidd begins moaning in pain, claiming he has a toothache. The doctor begins to examine him when Wint drops the live scorpion into his shirt, killing him. A helicopter arrives, the pilot demanding to know where the doctor is. Kidd and Wint tell the man that the doctor is ill and couldn't make it. They give the man a case, presumably containing the diamonds. As the chopper flies off, it explodes. Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd then walk off, hand-in-hand, with the diamonds.Suspecting that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping and convinced that Blofeld is dead, M (Bernard Lee) orders Bond to go undercover as smuggler Peter Franks, whom has been arrested and detained and unveil the smuggling ring. Meanwhile, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd arrive in Amsterdam and systematically kill more diamond smugglers involved in the ring. Posing as Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet his contact, a shrewd American woman named Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), at her apartment where he is to pick up the diamonds. However, the real Franks has escaped custody and shows up later that evening and tries to contact Case. Bond intercepts and kills him and sabotages the attack to make it seem like Franks is actually James Bond. Case and Bond smuggle the diamonds to Los Angeles hiding them inside Franks' corpse. They are unaware that Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are also on the same flight to Los Angeles.At the LA airport, Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter (Norman Burton) and transports the body to Slumber Inc., a funeral home which is a smuggling front where Bond meets the lead undertaker Rodney (Marc Lawrence) and his assistant (Sid Haig) where the dead body of Franks is cremated and the diamonds passed onto the next smuggler, an elderly man named Shady Tree. While Bond retrieves the cash for the diamonds, he's knocked unconscious by Wint and Kidd, who put him in a coffin and trundle it into the cremation oven. Bond nearly burns alive when the coffin is suddenly opened by Tree and Mr. Slumber. Tree accuses Bond of giving them fake diamonds and Bond counters saying that they wouldn't have tried to burn him alive with the real money. Bond tells Leiter to ship the real diamonds while he relaxes at a Las Vegas hotel and casino called The Whyte House, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond discovers Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd in his dressing room, who did not know that the diamonds were fake. When the casino pit boss, Mr. Saxby, and the underboss to Wint and Kidd, realizes that Tree did not have the real diamonds, he contacts his superior for further instructions.Later in the casino, Bond meets an opportunistic woman named Plenty O' Toole (Lana Wood). She cheers him on as he gambles, and, (in a deleted scene), they have dinner together. She invites herself up to his room, but after Bond undresses Plenty she is grabbed and thrown out of a window, landing in the hotel pool, by the Slumber Inc. thugs already waiting in his room, who have now come for the real diamonds. The thugs then leave Bond to spend the rest of the night with Tiffany Case whom is in the bedroom waiting for him. (In another deleted scene, Plenty returns to Bond's room to retrieve her clothes. She sees Bond and Tiffany in bed together, and takes an address card from Tiffany's purse, later to show up at Tiffany's house.)Tiffany tries to get Bond to reveal the location of the real diamonds by offering to help him steal the diamonds for themselves. Bond pretends to give in and arranges for her to retrieve the diamonds at the Circus Circus Las Vegas casino. At the circus, Tiffany picks up the diamonds in a stuffed toy puppy, unaware that she is under the surveillance of Felix Leiter and his men, but she reneges her deal with Bond and flees, shipping off the diamonds to the next smuggler. When Tiffany returns to her operation residence she finds Bond waiting for her and finds the body of Plenty, who was killed (presumably by Wint and Kidd) when she was mistaken for Tiffany. Having survived the attempt on her life, the initially reticent Tiffany tells Bond where the diamonds are.Bond and Tiffany go to the Las Vegas airport to watch the small locker where Tiffany was instructed to leave the stuffed puppy containing the diamonds. The toy is picked up by a porter who takes it to the casino pit boss, Saxby, who then drives it in a van to a local filling station where he switches with another man who gets in the van. Tiffany distracts the other driver of the van long enough for Bond to sneak in to follow the location of the diamonds. The van is driven outside of the city to a government laboratory in the desert.Posing as a lab worker, Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds; a research laboratory owned by reclusive Las Vegas millionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), where he finds the driver of the van is laser refraction specialist Professor Dr. Metz (Joseph Fürst) constructing a satellite. He notices a cassette tape in a case marked ""World's Greatest Marches"", which Metz possessively takes back from him. When his cover is blown, Bond escapes from the lab by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. They return to the Vegas that evening where they get into another wild car chase with the local police on Vegas' famous Freemont Street and evade all their police pursuers.Bond and Case check into a suite in the Whyte House where Felix and his men place Tiffany under house arrest after Bond finally reveals his real identity to her. Bond later scales the walls to the top floor of the Whyte House to confront Willard Whyte. Inside, 007 is confronted by two identical Blofelds who are posing as Whyte using an adapted telephone to mask their voice. (The Blofeld Bond killed in the pre-title teaser was another imposter.) Not knowing which to kill, Bond kicks Blofeld's white Persian cat into the arms of one of the pair and shoots him. However, Bond again chose the wrong man, killing another imposter. Blofeld refuses to reveal any of his plan to Bond and orders him into an elevator where he is sprayed with gas and knocked out.Bond is taken by Wint and Kidd to be buried underground in the desert in a new sewer line. He escapes and contacts Blofeld, posing as Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and, after a brief battle with his female bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, rescues Whyte, but in the meantime Blofeld escapes from the Whyte House and abducts Tiffany. With the help of Whyte and Felix, Bond returns to the government lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a laser satellite using the diamonds, which is now already in orbit. Blofeld destroys nuclear installations in the United States and China, a Russian nuclear submarine in the Pacific and then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.Looking over Whyte's map of his business empire, Bond identifies an oil rig off the coast of Baja California as Blofeld's base of operations. Arriving at the rig, he is immediately apprehended. Bond had planned to switch the cassette containing the codes which control the satellite with a music tape. After he does, he gives the coded one to Tiffany who is living there as a hostage. However, trying to be helpful, she re-switches the tapes, then gets caught trying to fix her mistake and is sent down to the brig. At this point, Felix Leiter and the CIA have already begun a heavy attack on the oil-rig aboard a fleet of helicopters. Tiffany manages to escape amidst the chaos and regroup with Bond. Blofeld tries to escape on a mini-sub, but Bond gains control of the crane used to lower it and crashes the sub into the control room, defeating Blofeld and destroying the satellite control along with the rest of the base.Bond and Tiffany then head for home on a P&O ship Canberra, but they are unaware that Wint and Kidd also aboard. That evening, disguised as waiters, Wint and Kidd enter Bond and Tiffany's stateroom to serve them dinner and leave them with a bomb hidden in a cake timed to go off in three minutes. Despite having never seen them face-to-face, Bond sees through their ploy when he recognizes the scent of Wint's aftershave. When Bond blows Wint's cover by tricking him into revealing his poor knowledge of wines, a fight breaks out, and Bond disposes of both of them; Kidd is set on fire and jumps over the side into the sea and Wint has the bomb tied to him after Bond discovers it. Bond flips him overboard seconds before the bomb explodes. The film ends with Tiffany asking Bond how can they get all the diamonds in the orbiting laser satellite back down to Earth again which now appears as a bright spot in the night sky."

Harry angrily responds that he's been sitting on his ass in the mayor's office, then lays out the plan of investigation so far. Lt. Bressler announces that he's arranged for helicopter surveillance in probable target areas. To Harry's disbelief, the mayor agrees to lead Scorpio on for the time being, to post a message in the newspaper (per Scorpio's instructions) as if they plan to pay him. Before leaving, the Mayor tells Harry that he doesn't want the same kind of trouble that Harry's caused in the past. Harry responds that he was trying to stop a rape, and, again with sarcasm, shoots down the Mayor.Across from a bank, Harry sits down for a hot dog lunch. He asks the cook behind the counter if the car across the street, in front of the bank, is still running. The cook says it is, and Harry tells him to call the police - there is an armed robbery in progress at that bank. No sooner does he say this than the banks alarms go off and gunfire erupts. Harry takes a bite of his hot dog, swears, and then heads out to face the robbers. He orders one man to freeze, and the man shoots at Harry with a shotgun, who returns fire. The men in the car speed toward Harry, but he shoots into the windshield, causing them to crash into a fire hydrant and flip the car over. One man jumps out and shoots at Harry, who shoots back and kills him. He looks down at his leg, shot and bleeding from buckshot, but he seems unaffected... still chewing on his hot dog.Harry strolls through the spraying water of the fire hydrant, to the wounded man by the entrance of the bank. The man's hand moves slowly toward his dropped shotgun, and Harry points his revolver at him and makes his famous ""six-shots-or-only-five"" speech with a hit of sarcasm in his voice: ""I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots, or only five? Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But this here is a .44 Magnum Revolver, the most powerful handgun in the world and it'll blow your head clean off. You've gotta ask yourself one question: do I feel lucky? Well... do you, punk?""The man cowers and surrenders. Harry picks up the shotgun, and the robber stops him. ""Hey I gots to know."" he asks. Harry raises his .44 Magnum and pulls the trigger and smiles. Harry fooled the wounded robber into giving up. The gun is empty.In the hospital, Harry has his wounded leg looked at by a doctor. During the process of treatment, the doctor tells Harry to have his wife to help treat his wound, but stops himself mid-sentence and apologizes.In the air, a police helicopter is making the rounds over the city.The next day, Harry walks through the department and meets with the captain, who congratulates Harry on stopping the robbery. The captain announces that he's saddling Harry with a new partner, and introduces Chico Gonzales. Harry gripes about not wanting a partner, and that his partners always wind up in the hospital, or dead. But the captain is unmoved and tells Harry that he doesn't have a choice.Harry and Chico walk and talk for a while, before stopping to talk with another cop, DiGiorgio. Chico warily asks how Harry got his nickname Dirty Harry. DiGiorgio fills him in, explaining that Harry is an equal opportunity bigot, hating every ethnicity equally. Chico asks how he feels about Mexicans, and Harry responds that he hates them especially.Somewhere in the city, Scorpio is on another rooftop, across from a church, reading the personal ad that contains the city's response to his ransom. Unhappy with the ""be patient"" message, he tears up the paper, and walks to the roof's ledge. He opens his rifle case and begins spying down on the neighborhood through his scope. He sees a black man walking on the street and places the cross hairs on him. Scorpio follows him for a while, and then hastily puts his rifle together. Before he can take his shot, though, the police chopper spots him and he is forced to retreat.That night, Harry and Chico are riding through the city, complaining about how the chopper cops lost Scorpio. Over the radio, they hear a description of the sniper, and Chico immediately spots a man fitting the description and carrying a tan suitcase. They turn around to follow him, but eventually split up, with Harry inconspicuously pursuing him on foot.Harry walks down an alley and spies the man walking into an apartment. He climbs up on a trashcan and looks into the apartment window. The man's suitcase is only holding lingerie for his girlfriend, Hot Mary, who is walking around the apartment topless. Harry realizes this is not Scorpio, but is suddenly attacked from behind by a couple of men who thought he was a peeping tom. They smack Harry around a bit, before Chico stops them. Harry tells him to let the guys go, though, and Chico jokes about why the other officers call him Dirty Harry.Back in the car, Harry and Chico get a call from an officer who spots a man on a roof, and they take off in that direction. It turns out the man is not Scorpio, but instead, he's a suicidal jumper. Without much hesitation, Harry climbs into a crane bucket and rides up to the roof, to confront the man. The jumper immediately tells Harry to stay away, and Harry tells the man he's going to keep his distance: jumpers sometimes decide to take someone with them when they die. A grotesque story follows, about a fellow officer who was killed like that. Harry includes all the gory details causing the man to become sick. Angered, he attempts to grab at Harry, but Harry's quicker and punches him out, cuffs him to the rails on the crane bucket and brings him down. On the street, Harry tells Chico he got his nickname by taking ""any dirty job that comes along"".The next day, Harry and Chico are called to the site of a dead body: a young black kid is found shot in the head. As Harry and Chico are looking over the crime scene, the boy's mother tells them her son was only ten years old. Another officer finds a shell casing that confirms the boy was killed by Scorpio.Harry has a meeting with the chief, and they discuss the plan to capture Scorpio. They will post highly-visible policemen all over the city at high probability targets, but no policemen near the site where the chopper had spotted him the day before. Harry and Chico will stake out the area, armed and ready to take Scorpio down if he appears. Chico expresses his doubts that Scorpio will target the same area twice, but Harry explains that he believes the sniper will want to take out a priest now.That night, the two detectives are watching over the church. Harry tells Chico that the priest of the church volunteered to be bait for the murderer. With binoculars, Harry spies on the entire neighborhood, including a nude woman and her two male companions. As he's watching the party, he notices that one of the nearby roof doors is now open. Harry and Chico prepare to throw the spotlight on Scorpio, and Harry takes aim with his rifle. He fires, but misses. Scorpio fires on them with a machine gun but misses, destroying the lights. He laughs gleefully as he fires.Harry and Chico rush downstairs, and across the street, where DiGiorgio kneels over the body of an officer that Scorpio apparently killed in his escape.The next day, their captain tells Harry and Chico that Scorpio has kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, Ann Mary Deacon. His ransom note says that he's buried her alive, and has raised his ransom to $200,000, demanding it by 9pm. He threatens to let the girl suffocate to death if he's not paid. Harry insists that the girl is probably already dead, but Lt. Bressler tells him that the mayor has agreed to pay. He asks Harry to drop the money off, and tells Chico he's not allowed to help.Chico responds, 'No wonder they call him Dirty Harry. Always gets the shit-end of the stick.'Harry prepares for the drop by getting a microphone to put under his shirt, so that Chico can furtively follow him. Harry gets the money from the mayor's office. While the captain tells Harry that Scorpio will probably run Harry all over town before he drops the money, Harry tapes a switchblade to his ankle. The captain tells Harry to play it straight and not to try anything funny.Harry arrives at the marina, the designated drop point, and answers a nearby payphone. Scorpio tells him he's going to give Harry a little exercise and intends to have him travel all over the city on foot to make sure he's not being followed. Hidden nearby in his car, Chico listens in. Scorpio instructs Harry to run to a nearby railroad station.He makes it and answers the Scorpio's call. Harry next has to make a train that is leaving the station immediately. Barely making it, he jumps on and rides to the next checkpoint. Chico continues to follow. Harry answers the next call, and Scorpio laughs as he tells Harry that he's going to have a long run now.While running, Harry is accosted by three thugs who try to take the money bag. It's a short delay, but Harry can't afford it, and he quickly beats the three goons down. He sprints to the phone, but a man answers it before Harry can. Scorpio hangs up, but calls back immediately, giving Harry instructions to run to Mission Davis Park and meet him there at the foot of the cross. Chico follows but keeps a safe distance.Harry walks through the park, taking a look at everyone he passes. A young man that Harry thinks may be Scorpio turns out to be a male hustler, so Harry runs him off. He makes it to the top of the hill in Mission Davis Park, at the foot of the large stone cross. Scorpio shows up wearing a ski mask. Scorpio disarms Harry and starts to beat him. He tells Harry that he changed his mind and has decided to let the girl die, and now he's going to kill Harry, too. Before he can, though, Chico shoots at him, but misses. Scorpio and Chico exchange fire, and Chico is hit in the chest. Harry pulls the switchblade from his leg and plunges it deep into Scorpio's leg. Scorpio screams and limps off. Harry tries to shoot at Scorpio, but misses and then passes out from the beating. Scorpio makes it to a hospital.In his office, the hot-headed Bressler is talking to the chief on the phone; the chief is not happy that Harry and Chico disobeyed orders. Harry tells Bressler he'll quit when this is over, if that's what the chief wants. They get a call from a doctor at an emergency room: the doctor reports treating a man with a stab wound in the leg.Harry and DiGiorgio talk to the doctor who isn't very helpful at first. But he does remember that he had seen the man before. After a few moments he remembers that the man works as a groundskeeper at a nearby stadium. Harry and DiGiorgio climb the fence outside the stadium, and inspect the grounds in the dark. Scorpio spies on them and eventually takes off running. Harry chases him while DiGiorgio looks for a way to turn on the lights. Scorpio is running/limping across the football field, when Harry finally catches up to him, and DiGiorgio hits the floodlights.Harry has his gun on Scorpio and fires, hitting him in the leg. Scorpio sobs for help and Harry demands to know where the girl is. Scorpio yells that Harry tried to kill him, but Harry replies: ""If I was trying to kill you, your head would be splattered all over this field!"". Harry again demands to know where the girl is. The psychopathic Scorpio yells that he has rights and he wants a lawyer, but Harry angrily grinds his foot into the wound, as the scene pulls up and away from the two men in Kezar Stadium.At dawn, Harry stands on a hilltop overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. Behind him, officers are pulling the dead body of Ann Mary Deacon out of the ground.Harry is called to a meeting with William Rothko, the Assistant District Attorney. He is shocked and disgusted that the DA is going to release Scorpio, because Harry's search of the killer's home was illegal (the issue of probable cause is never brought up) and the rifle that is the murder weapon is inadmissible as evidence. Bannerman, a local by-the-book judge, backs up Rothko's claim, and the D.A. condescendingly chastises Harry about the suspect's rights. Harry fumes and wants to know about the rights of the victims, but the arrogant and unfeeling D.A. does not care. ""That's the law"", he says, and Harry retorts: ""Then the law is crazy!""As he's leaving, Harry says that as soon as Scorpio slips up, Harry will be there to arrest him. The D.A. warns that he won't stand for harassment. Harry says that Scorpio is a sociopath con artist and he will not stop his killing spree, as ""he likes it too much"".Scorpio walks into a park in the middle of the day, and immediately notices Callahan following him. Sitting in a stag bar, he sees Harry watching him. The next day, Scorpio meets with a tough looking black guy in a run-down factory. The other man makes sure Scorpio wasn't followed and then leads him to a back room, where he takes payment from Scorpio: $200 for the man to beat Scorpio to a pulp. He sits him in a chair and then begins punching him in the face. He lands several heavy blows, but eventually grows dubious and stops. Scorpio taunts him with racist remarks and the black man kicks him in the face. Realizing that his victim is insane, he kicks Scorpio out.The next scene shows him being wheeled down the hall of a hospital, enthusiastically talking to reporters and blaming the San Francisco police for his beating. He falsely singles out Harry as the main culprit. The chief meets with Harry, but Harry says he looks ""too damn good"" to have caught a beating from Harry himself. The chief orders Harry to stop tailing Scorpio. Harry leaves with a scoff.Harry visits Chico at the hospital, where he is sitting outside with his wife. Chico tells Harry that he's not coming back to the department. He is going to be a teacher instead. Chico is wheeled off to physical therapy, leaving Harry and Mrs. Gonzalez to chat for a while. They walk out of the hospital, and Chico's wife tells Harry that she feels responsible for his leaving. She tells him that she got nervous every time Chico left, and asks Harry if his wife felt the same. Harry says no. He tells her that his wife died in a drunk-driving accident some years ago. Harry tells Chico's wife that he understands why Chico is leaving the police force. When she asks him why he stays in the job, Harry says, ""I don't know. I really don't"".Later that night, the killer Scorpio enters a liquor store and chats with the shopkeeper. To explain his beaten face, he makes up a lie about hitting his wife and being beaten by her brother. He asks the owner about his being robbed before, and the owner admits to shooting and killing the last two robbers. He brags and shows off his pistol to show Scorpio. Scorpio instantly smashes a bottle over the shopkeeper's head and takes the gun.The next scene shows a school bus dropping children off at the end of the school day. Scorpio climbs into the bus pretending to be a school bus inspector. When the driver tries to stop him, Scorpio pulls the gun on her. He tells her to start driving, he'll direct her. He then turns his attention to the kids, making them sing.At city hall, Harry's captain watches as Harry arrives. As he and the captain walk up to the mayor's office, they discuss a new note from Scorpio. They enter the mayor's office, while the mayor is preparing a jet for the killer. The mayor then takes a call from Scorpio, who informs them of the bus hostage situation. He forces the bus driver to confirm. He demands his jet and $200,000, and tells mayor he intends to take the bus to the airport. The mayor foolishly tells Scorpio that he won't be harmed. The chief asks Harry to take the money, but when they order him to just make the drop without trying to stop Scorpio, he refuses, telling the arrogant mayor, ""Go find yourselves another delivery boy"".Back on the bus, Scorpio has the children maniacally singing ""Row, row, row your boat"", but eventually the children become whiny, wanting to get home. Scorpio quickly loses patience, slapping one boy, and scaring the children even more. He gives the bus driver more directions, and has her exit the highway. They are headed for an underpass, and Scorpio panics when he sees Harry standing on top of the bridge, waiting for him. Harry jumps on the roof of the moving bus, and Scorpio starts shooting up at him, causing the bus driver to faint. Scorpio takes the wheel, and swerves the bus all over the road, trying to throw Harry off.He crashes the bus through a fence, sending Harry flying into a mound of sand. Scorpio jumps out of the back emergency exit and flees to a nearby mill. Harry chases him. While running, they exchange gunfire, and once again, we lose track of how many shots Harry has fired. Harry is gaining on Scorpio, so he tries to ambush him, but Harry ducks and Scorpio misses. Scorpio runs out the back of the mill, and to a small dock, where a young boy is fishing.With Harry not far behind him, Scorpio (ruthless to the last) grabs the boy and puts the gun to his head, yelling at Harry to drop his gun. Harry drops his arm to his side, but quickly brings it back up and shoots Scorpio in the shoulder, knocking him backwards. The boy escapes and quickly runs away.Scorpio tries to reach for his gun, but Harry stops him and points his revolver at the killer. He repeats his speech from earlier, but his wry grin is gone this time, replaced with dead-serious fury.""I know what you're thinking, punk! You're thinking, did he fire six shots, or only five?! Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and it'll blow your head clean off! You've gotta ask yourself a question! Do I feel lucky? Well, do you, punk?!""Scorpio thinks for a moment, then giggles madly and reaches for his pistol. Harry fires, shooting Scorpio in the chest. The psychopathic killer falls into the water and floats there, dead. Scorpio had unwisely called Harry's bluff - and paid for it with his life.Sirens wail in the distance. Harry takes out his badge. He pulls his gold star out of the leather fold and looks at it for a moment before throwing it into the water. The camera pans away from Harry as he walks away and the credits roll."
The Last Picture Show,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067328/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1951, a group of high schoolers come of age in a bleak, isolated, atrophied North Texas town that is slowly dying, both culturally and economically. In tiny Anarene, Texas, in the lull between World War Two and the Korean Conflict, Sonny and Duane are best friends. Enduring that awkward period of life between boyhood and manhood, the two pass their time the best way they know how -- with the movie house, football, and girls. Jacy is Duane's steady, wanted by every boy in school, and she knows it. Her daddy is rich and her mom is good looking and loose. It's the general consensus that whoever wins Jacy's heart will be set for life. But Anarene is dying a quiet death as folks head for the big cities to make their livings and raise their kids. The boys are torn between a future somewhere out there beyond the borders of town or making do with their inheritance of a run-down pool hall and a decrepit movie house -- the legacy of their friend and mentor, Sam the Lion. As high school graduation approaches, they learn some difficult lessons about love, loneliness, and jealousy. Then folks stop attending the second-run features at the movie house and the time comes for the last picture show. With the closure of the movie house, the boys feel that a stage of their lives is closing. They stand uneasily on the threshold of the rest of their lives. (The movie was adapted from the novel by Larry McMurtry).—Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu> It's 1951 in the small town of Anarene, located in the dust bowl of Texas. Sam the Lion, owner of the local café, pool hall and movie theater, and the unofficial father figure to many of the young men of the town, is one of the few people who seems content with his life in Anarene. Life in Anarene for the younger generation in particular seems to hold little interest and not much of a future. The sensitive Sonny Crawford and brusque Duane Jackson are high school seniors, co-captains of the hapless high school football team, and best friends. Duane is dating the beautiful Jacy Farrow, the daughter of the town's oil baron. Jacy's mother, Lois Farrow, offers Jacy advice for her future: marry the boy who offers the greatest opportunity, especially in escaping Anarene, that boy who isn't Duane. Jacy goes on that pursuit for good or bad. Sonny just broke up with his long time girlfriend Charlene Tuggs, the two who dated seemingly since there was nothing better to do. While Sonny dreams of Jacy, as do many of the boys, he ends up in an affair with middle aged Ruth Popper, the unhappy wife of the high school's football and basketball coach. These encounters and relationships, especially for Sonny, Duane and Jacy, who are just coming to the age of exploring their sexuality, show just what future there is for them in Anarene.—Huggo One morning in November 1951, Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges), co-captains of the dismal high school football team in the small dying town of Anarene, Texas shrug off insults about the team's last game of the season. Sonny relaxes with his friends, Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), the aging but still vital cowboy who owns the small town's cafe, pool hall and movie theater, and Sam's ward, the mute, gentle, simple-minded Billy (Sam Bottoms).Sonny and Duane have breakfast at the cafe, run by salty-tongued waitress Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), and discuss their usual Saturday night plans of seeing the ""picture show"" and necking with their girl friends in the pickup they jointly own. Sonny goes to work and that night, while Duane and his blonde girl friend, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), take the first turn in the pickup, Sonny joins his girl, Charlene Duggs (Sharon Taggart), in the theater. The unpleasant and bickering Charlene complains that Sonny has forgotten their one year anniversary, but Sonny is more interested in watching Jacy, the most beautiful and wealthiest girl in town, as she and Duane come into the theater and begin to kiss. Sonny and Charlene then take their turn in the pickup, but the frustrated Sonny, longing to do more than fondle Charlene's breasts, ends their stale relationship when she becomes petulant. Later at the cafe, Genevieve comforts Sonny and wonders why both he and Duane live in a boardinghouse rather than with their parents.At basketball practice one afternoon, Coach Popper offers to get Sonny excused from class the next day for driving the coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) to her doctor's appointment, and Sonny agrees. That night, Jacy is confronted by her alcoholic mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn), who does not want her daughter to waste her youth as she did. When Lois advises Jacy not to marry Duane and instead sleep with him to learn that there is ""nothing magic about it,"" Jacy is shocked.Then next day, Sonny arrives at Coach's home to pick up Ruth, and the shy woman is disappointed to see that her husband has not come himself. During the return trip, Sonny is nonplussed by Ruth's tears, although she tells him that there is nothing seriously wrong. Afraid to be alone, Ruth invites Sonny in for a soda, but her continuing sobs unsettle him even more, although he timidly tries to comfort her.Another few days later, at the town's annual Christmas dance, Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid), one of Jacy's country club friends, asks her to come to a nude swimming party at the home of wealthy Bobby Sheen (Gary Brockette). Eager for excitement, Jacy consents, then schemes on how to end her date with Duane. Perturbed to see Lois dancing with Abilene (Clu Gulager), the oil driller with whom Lois is having an affair, Jacy lures Duane to the pickup. There, Duane gives Jacy a lavish Christmas present and Jacy, hoping to distract him, places his hand under her skirt before announcing that Lois had ordered her to attend the swimming party with Lester. Meanwhile, Sonny helps Ruth clean up and while they are outside, they engage in a passionate kiss and agree to meet soon.In the nearby town of Wichita Falls, Lester introduces Jacy to Bobby and his crowd of sexually adventurous friends, and Jacy, eager to attract Bobby's attention, strips on the diving board and finally jumps into the pool, fully naked, and joins the group.Back at Anarene, Duane suggests to the other boys that they ought to buy a hooker for Billy so that he will not die a virgin. Sonny's attempts to stop them are unsuccessful and soon Billy is in the back seat of a car with local waitress Jimmie Sue, who, angered by Billy's fumbling, bloodies his nose with a massive punch.The group returns Billy to Sam's pool hall, and while Sam questions them, Duane hides. Upon hearing what the boys have done, Sam condemns their ""trashy behavior"" and bans them from entering his businesses. Duane pretends to have fallen asleep in the car, and as the weeks pass, continues to patronize Sam's establishments, while Sonny stays away and is lonesome for Sam, whom he admires deeply, as well as Billy and Genevieve.In the meantime, Sonny begins an affair with Ruth, although during their first encounter at her house, Ruth is so horrified by the loud squeaking of the bed springs that she cannot enjoy herself.Several weeks later, Sonny enters the cafe one night and Genevieve, while reprimanding him for his treatment of Billy, allows him to stay. She attempts to caution him about his affair with Ruth, which is common knowledge, but Sonny remains silent. Sam and Billy enter, and after Billy joyfully greets his friend, Sam forgives the repentant youth.Another afternoon later on New Year's Eve, Sam takes Sonny and Billy fishing and reminisces about a time 20 years earlier when he brought a young lady friend swimming at the same spot. Although he and his paramour were in love, she was already married and Sam lost her. Meanwhile, in Wichita Falls, Jacy attends another party at Bobby's, where the arrogant young man asks if she is a virgin. When Jacy admits that she is, Bobby tells her to come back when she is more experienced.Back in town, a bored Sonny and Duane decide to go to Mexico for the weekend and Sam, bemused by their exuberance, gives them some money. Upon their return a few days later on January 3, however, the boys are shocked to learn that Sam has died from a sudden heart attack during their absence. In his will, Sam leaves the movie theater to Miss Jessie Mosey, who ran the theater's concession counter, the cafe to Genevieve and the pool hall to Sonny, which stuns the young man.A few months later, the spring season arrives. The senior class attends their class picnic in Wichita Falls and Jacy plans a rendezvous with Duane at a local motel so that she can be rid of her virginity. The excitement and pressure make Duane impotent, although he is successful upon their second attempt after graduation.Meanwhile, Ruth, who has blossomed under Sonny's attention and fallen in love with him, gives Sonny a wallet for graduation. Jacy breaks up with Duane, telling him that she would rather be with Bobby. Heartbroken, Duane leaves town for an oil-drilling job. Jacy's plans go awry, however, when Bobby dallies with her, then marries his girl friend.One night, bored and lonely, Jacy is sitting at home when Abilene arrives to see Lois. Flirting outrageously, Jacy asks Abilene to take her to the pool hall, where he has sex with her on a pool table. Upon their return, however, Abilene treats Jacy coldly, and when she sees her mother, Jacy breaks into tears. As Lois is comforting her, she mentions Ruth and Sonny's relationship, and Jacy, who was unaware of Sonny's liaison, is intrigued, as she knows about Sonny's crush on her.Determined to win Sonny away from Ruth, Jacy begins to date him, and promises that eventually they will spend the night together. Intoxicated, Sonny avoids Ruth, who waits miserably for him every afternoon.Skipping forward another few months later, the summer passes until one day, Duane comes home for a visit and questions Sonny about Jacy. Sonny admits that they have been dating and as the confrontation grows more heated, reveals that Jacy told him about Duane's impotence. Furious, Duane smashes his beer bottle against Sonny's temple, nearly blinding him. While he is in the hospital, Sonny refuses to see Ruth and Duane joins the US Army.Later, when Sonny returns home, Jacy, who is thrilled to be the center of attention due to the fight over her, tells him they should elope. Eagerly anticipating having sex with Jacy, Sonny acquiesces, but after they are married and are driving home, Jacy reveals that she left a note for her parents detailing their plans. Sonny is crushed when they are stopped by a patrolman and Jacy is driven home by her furious father, who arranges for the marriage to be annulled, but Jacy, who wanted only to heighten her notoriety, is pleased. A resigned Lois drives Sonny back to Anarene, where she reveals that she was the woman with whom Sam had the affair twenty years earlier.Another month or two later in the autumn season, Sonny watches the school football team play and learns that Duane is home on leave. Both dreading and needing to see his friend before he ships out for Korea, Sonny finds Duane and asks if he wants to attend the picture show, as Miss Mosey is being forced to close it due to lack of business. Duane agrees and the boys spend a companionable evening watching the last movie.In the morning, Duane admits that if he had married Jacy, her father would have forced them to get an annulment, too. After Duane leaves on the bus, Sonny is in the pool hall when he hears the screech of brakes in the street and rushes outside to discover that Billy has been hit and killed by a trucker who did not see him, but then drove away from the scene in a hit-and-run. Grief-stricken, Sonny lashes out at the gathered men who deride Billy as a simpleton, then drags his friend's body to the sidewalk, where he carefully covers him.In the final scene, Sonny then drives to Ruth's house, where the surprised woman admits him but then upbraids him for breaking her heart. Although Ruth tells Sonny that he has ruined what was between them, when he tenderly takes one of her hands, she caresses him in return and tells him, ""Never you mind, honey. Never you mind."""
Carnal Knowledge,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066892/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Chronicling the lifelong sexual development of two men who meet and become friends in college. The concurrent sexual lives of best friends Jonathan and Sandy are presented, lives that are affected by the sexual mores of the time and their own temperaments, especially in relation to the women in their lives. Their story begins in the late 1940s when they are roommates attending Amherst College together. Both virgins, they discuss the type of woman they would each like to end up with. The more-sensitive Sandy meets Susan at a mixer and believes he'll lose his virginity to her. He goes through the process methodically, considering what she wants, but there's little true passion or romance. The more sexually-aggressive Jonathan, loses his own virginity to ""Myrtle,"" a steady but hidden girlfriend. Based on what each knows of the other's relationship, both men strive for a little more of what the other has. These relationships also set the tone for all the relationships they will have in the future. Through their lives, they always seem not totally satisfied with each relationship, still pining for what the other has. This view might change as they and their friendship hits middle age, when Sandy is with a domineering woman named Cindy, while Jonathan is with model/actress Bobbie, whose life goes spiraling downward because of her relationship to Jonathan and despite her beauty which on the surface offered so much opportunity for her. Jonathan's sexual trajectory, directed through these experiences, ends up in a manner he probably did not foresee.—Huggo Jonathan and Sandy are roommates in the university. Each has a different behavior and experience with women. Jonathan is cynical, malicious, and selfish. He does not respect anybody (even his best friend is not respected) and just want to have sex; women are objects for him. Sandy is almost the opposite of Jonathan and has a different approach with women: he is shy, sensitive and respectful; he does not have much experience with women. Sandy dates Susan but Jonathan passes on her at the beginning of a love triangle. A few years later, Sandy and Susan are married and Jonathan and Sandy are successful professionally and boring with their mates. Then, Jonathan has a relationship with the sexy Bobbie. As years go by, the two friends have affairs with different women but no steady relationships.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film traces the sexual and emotional confusion of two men from their Amherst College days in the fifties through the Kennedy sixties, up to the Vietnam era. Jonathan, a successful tax attorney and Sandy, a physician, personify two extremes of self-delusion and self-aggrandizement: Jonathan makes the mistake of thinking sex is love, and embarks on a lifetime of sexual conquest; Sandy dedicates himself to the pursuit of an idealized woman and the dreamy spiritual completeness to be found therein. In Bobbie Jonathan finds a partner whose masochism compliments his selfishness and emotional ambivalence. Jonathan does not want her to hold a job, but neither does he like the fact that she spends all day in bed sleeping, or watching TV. Sandy falls in love with his first college romance, Susan; they marry and have children. But Sandy is haunted by the fear that he was too hasty, even though he and Susan lead a happy domestic life and strive to reinvigorate their sex life by making love ""in all seven rooms"" of their apartment. With Jonathan's help, he enters into an affair with Cindy, a tough professional woman who turns Sandy off because she is too overbearing.—alfiehitchie At Amherst College in the late 1940s, freshmen roommates Jonathan Bates (Jack Nicholson) and Sanford 'Sandy' Cohn (Art Garfunkle) develop a friendly rivalry over their attempts at ""scoring"" on their dates with female students. The sexually aggressive Jonathan wants to be ""smothered and mothered"" by large breasts, while shy, romantic Sandy claims to value intelligence and sincerity.The film opens at a college party where Jonathan spots Smith College student Susan (Candice Bergman) and, after summarily dismissing her breast size, encourages Sandy to approach her. Sandy's initial clumsy attempt leads to several dates with the intellectual and humorous Susan, which he then reports in detail to Jonathan. After Jonathan pushes him to ""feel her up"", Sandy persists in trying to touch Susan's breasts on a subsequent date, but Susan claims that she is not sexually attracted to him. Desperate, Sandy admits that she is the first girl that he has ever tried to touch in that way. Feeling sorry for Sandy, Susan allows him to touch her while she puts her hand on his penis.After Jonathan learns that Susan is more promiscuous than he had previously thought, he asks Susan to go out with him. While neither Jonathan nor Susan tells Sandy about the resulting romance, Sandy continues to tell about his dates with Susan, claiming that he has fallen in love because she appreciates his sensitivity and intellect.On his next date with Susan, Jonathan, jealous that Susan likes Sandy more than him, tries to win her sympathy by fabricating a story about his humble childhood which led him to want to become a socially conscious lawyer. Several dates later, Jonathan's ploy pays off and Susan agrees to have sex, but does not enjoy the act. Jonathan describes his dates with Susan to Sandy, but calls her ""Myrtle"" to keep their betrayal a secret. When Sandy learns that Jonathan has lost his virginity with ""Myrtle"", he tries to have sex with Susan, who at first refuses but finally relents.Months later during the winter, Sandy confesses to Jonathan that he is jealous of the fact that Jonathan lost his virginity before him and continues to have more adventuresome sex than he does. One night, when the three friends go out together, Susan dances with both men, enjoying Jonathan's suave demeanor and easy footwork more than Sandy's awkward attempts at intimacy on the dance floor. Later, Jonathan, angry that Susan has told Sandy that she feels so close to him she can read his thoughts, demands that Susan choose between the two men. When they both agree to break the affair soon after, Susan suggests that they can still be friends, but Jonathan coolly remarks, ""I hope not"". Days later in Sandy and Jonathan's dormitory room, Susan and Sandy playfully argue like a married couple over packing for a camping trip while Jonathan sullenly watches.The film then jumps forward around 10 years later. The two friends meet at an ice skating rink in New York's Central Park and discuss their lives. Jonathan, who is now a taxman, is still the consummate, slightly misogynist playboy and complains the assertive women are gold-digging castrators, and claims that he wants to settle down with someone ""if their figure is good enough"".Sandy, who has married Susan and started a family, is bored with their suburban life and jealous of Jonathan's sexual freedom. Sandy eventually tells Susan that he wants a divorce, and she throws him out of their house.Meanwhile, Jonathan begins dating model Bobbie (Ann-Margaret), whose revealing clothing displays her voluptuous figure. After several weeks of dating and passionate lovemaking with Jonathan, Bobbie suggests they move in together, but Jonathan rejects the proposal, suggesting that it will ruin their sex. Soon after, Jonathan confesses to Sandy that he was experiencing moments of impotence, but has been cured by his attraction to Bobbie's figure. After Bobbie moves in with him, Jonathan insists the she quit her job, promising to provide for her. Bobbie concedes in hopes of marrying Jonathan and having children, but he continues to adamantly resist the idea.At home with nothing to do, Bobbie becomes increasingly depressed, rarely leaving her bed and barely capable of warming television dinners for Jonathan. Lacking in any tenderness, Jonathan constantly berates and humiliates Bobbie, causing her to weep in despair. After Jonathan rages at Bobbie for having a more ""checkered"" sexual past than him and orders her to do something useful like housework, a desperate and sobbing Bobbie states that she cannot stand her life.One night, when Sandy and his new sophisticated girlfriend, Cindy (Cynthia O'Neal), are at Jonathan's apartment to pick them up for a party, Jonathan tells Sandy that Bobbie is too passive, while Sandy claims Cindy dominates him in the bedroom. After Jonathan urges Sandy to swap partners for the night, Sandy agrees and goes to the bedroom to find Bobbie. Jonathan then dances with Cindy, who refuses his advances, confidently explaining that she will sleep with him but only on her terms. When Cindy leaves after ordering Jonathan to tell Sandy that he should not bother returning home if he sleeps with Bobbie, Jonathan opens the bedroom door to find Bobbie passed out from an overdose and Sandy calling an ambulance. Even as he witnesses Bobbie's despair, Jonathan can only yell at the unconscious woman that their relationship is ""not going to work out"".In the present day 1970, more then twenty years since their college days, the now jaded middle-aged friends are still far from understanding love in a committed relationship. Wealthy Jonathan complains about his alimony payments to his now ex-wife Bobbie and their child, while Sandy, desperate to recapture his youth, dates demure 18-year-old Jennifer (Carol Kane), dresses in hippie attire, and espouses the ""free love"" of the new generation. When Sandy and Jennifer visit Jonathan, he presents a slide show of all his lovers, including a picture of Susan which he attempts to ignore, referring to them all as ""frigid ball-busters"", and paints increasingly degrading verbal portraits of each woman, upsetting Sandy and Jennifer.Later, Jonathan confesses to Sandy that he has only glimpsed the illusive nature of love through brief sexual encounters, while Sandy laments that when he finally falls in love with a woman and makes a commitment, his sexual interest in them dies.With his impotence increasing, Jonathan seeks out aging prostitute Louise (Rita Moreno), who obliges Jonathan's obsessive request that she perform a verbal ritual worshiping men's ""virile"" and ""domineering"" behavior and castigating women as manipulative and castrating. When Louise veers slightly from the script, an enraged Jonathan, whose libido has immediately faltered, demands that she repeat the lines verbatim to ensure his satisfaction."
The Hospital,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067217/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hospital's chief-of-staff struggles to find meaning in his life during a spate of staff deaths. Dr. Herbert Bock (George C. Scott), the chief of medicine in a New York City teaching hospital, is contemplating suicide. He's impotent, his wife has left him, and his children aren't speaking to him. His hospital is also suffering from a recent spate of inexplicable deaths. In the midst of these setbacks, Bock is romantically drawn to the much younger Barbara Drummond (Dame Diana Rigg), whose father is a patient. As Barbara restores Bock's will to live, it turns out that the hospital deaths are murders.—Jwelch5742 The personal life of Dr. Herbert Bock, the Chief of Medicine at Manhattan Medical Center, which also operates as a teaching hospital, is in shambles as he and his longtime wife have split once again after years of a dysfunctional marriage - he having moved into a shabby hotel - and blames himself both for the way their two now grown offspring turned out and thus the reason for not much liking them. He will be walking into this day at the hospital which seems to be in equal shambles, his ability to cope not great seeing as to his personal situation. Beyond a demonstration outside the hospital in protest to they developing an adjacent property, the demonstration with which the frazzled Chief of Administrative, Dr. John Sundstrom, will primarily have to deal, a young resident Dr. Howard Schaefer has been discovered dead in one of the hospital beds, in what at first glance looks to be a case of malpractice of the hospital. These two items are just the highest profile, at least for staff, of the many problems that are emerging at the hospital this day as they have to put out one fire after another, those fires seemingly caused by mismanagement and/or incompetence. But as more medical staff are found dead around the hospital by unusual circumstances, there may more at play this day than initially thought. Through all this chaos, Bock may find some meaning in life in dealing with the case of patient Edward Drummond, who came into the hospital a relatively healthy man, but who has fallen into a coma the result of that staff mismanagement/incompetence. That meaning comes in the form of Drummond's daughter, Barbara Drummond, an RN herself, who wants to take her father back to Mexico where he had been doing missionary work.—Huggo Dr. Herbert Bock (George C. Scott) is chief of medicine in a major teaching hospital. His wife has left him, he is impotent, and his children have disowned him. He is toying with the idea of suicide when patients begin dying, not from complications, but from the erroneous treatments the Hospital is giving them. People in the wrong beds are given wrong medicines, sent to operating theaters for incorrect surgery, and found in waiting rooms dead of natural causes. Barbara Drummond (Dame Diana Rigg) has come to take her comatose father back to the Sioux reservation, where he operates a clinic, and they each reach out to each other for emotional support, as a shadowy figure stalks the patients and staff of the hospital.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>"

In the process of exterminating the rats, Willard saves them and finds as he feeds and plays with them that he can train the animals, by feeding them, and setting himself in their instincts as a rescuer. He baits the rats onto a pillar in the center of a well, and removes the wood bridge that they crossed.

It means flying to the magical ""Isle of Naboombu"" in search of the powerful Star of Astoroth. It's to be put to use in the war effort, just in time as the Germans land in the coastal town for a terror surprise mini-invasion, only to be fought off by a magical army.—KGF Vissers During World War II, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul Rawlins go to live with Miss Eglantine Price. She is an apprentice witch at a Correspondence College of Witchcraft. It turns out that tracking down the spell for ""Substitutiary Locomotion"" leads to romance for her and Professor Emelius Browne. In August 1940 in the English village of Pepperinge Eye, three cockney orphans are sent to live with Miss Eglantine Price, who is studying to become an apprentice witch. When she receives a letter from the Correspondence College of Witchcraft in London, she and the children fly on her late father's brass bed (by way of a magical bedknob) to London to meet the headmaster of the defunct school, Professor Emelius Browne. At a vacant estate where he is staying, Miss Price finds half of a book called ""The Spells of Astoroth"". For the other half, they deal with a shady character known as the ""Bookman"", and travel to a foreign imaginary animal island known as the ""Isle of Naboombu"".—Matthew Anscher (c/o Mitchell Anscher) <anscher@radonc.duke.edu> Bedknobs and BroomsticksThe movie is mainly set in a small South Coast English village, Pepperinge Eye, during World War II: an elderly farmer (Cyril Delevanti) is painting out the sign-posts, the Home Guard are exercising, led by General Sir Brian Teagler (Reginald Owen) and Captain Aisley Greer (Arthur Gould-Porter), and Mrs. Jessica Hobday (Tessie OShea) is allocating homes to children whom have been evacuated from London (sent to the countryside away from the risk of bombing raids). The three Rawlings children, Charlie (Ian Weighill), Carrie (Cindy OCallaghan) and Paul (Roy Smart) are assigned and reluctantly taken in by Miss Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury). The children are also unhappy, not least at Miss Price's vegetarian lifestyle, and plan to run back to London, but unexpectedly discover, through her attempts to fly on a broomstick, that Miss Price is a trainee witch, complete with black cat (""Cosmic Creepers"") and fully fitted magical laboratory (""poisoned dragons liver""); and to ensure their silence about this, she presents Paul, the youngest, with a magical bed-knob with which he can cause the bed to travel anywhere.Miss Price is eagerly awaiting the last installment of her magic correspondence course from 'Professor' Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson) of the College of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and is very disappointed when it fails to arrive, the College having closed. Using the bed (song: 'Age of Not Believing'), she and the children visit Mr. Browne in London, where he is revealed as a somewhat shady stage-magician turned street-vendor selling magic tricks: he takes Miss Price and the children to his home, a mansion abandoned because of an USN-exploded bomb in the front garden, where the children play in the nursery and he, astounded that Miss Price can actually perform genuine magic, firstly tries to induce her to form a magic variety act with him (song: 'Eglantine'), and then (after being briefly turned into a white rabbit by Miss Price to force him to be sensible) reveals that he copied all the spells used in his correspondence course from an old book, 'The Spells of Astaroth', of which, however, he only possesses the first half, without the words to the ""substitutiary locomotion"" spell so desired by Miss Price.Mr. Browne decides the other half of the book is likely to be found in the Portobello Road street-market, so all go there the following day to search for the book, meeting amongst others an old-book-seller (Ben Wrigley). After an extensive song-and-dance-number (song: 'Portobello Road', featuring representatives of many nations which were part of the Allied WWII forces, including Scots, Indians and Jamaicans), as the market is closing, Browne is approached by the sinister 'spiv' Swinburne (Bruce Forsyth) who takes him (and the children and Miss Price, and the bed) to The Bookman (Sam Jaffe) who possesses the other half of the book, but this also does not contain the spell words. It is revealed that the spell is actually inscribed on the 'Star of Astaroth', now in the possession of magically enhanced and human-like animals, formerly owned by the sorcerer Astaroth, on the Isle of Naboombu. Paul, who has taken a cloth book about the Isle of Naboombu from the nursery, now activates the bed-knob to take Mr. Browne, Miss Price, and the three children there. (The following section of the movie, on Naboombu, is animation with live-action from these five individuals).Arriving at the Isle of Naboombu, the bed and its occupants falls into the lagoon, where it is washed into a sunken ship, the Beautiful Briny Ballroom where the fish are dancing: Mr. Browne and Miss Price join in (song: 'Beautiful Briny Sea'), and win the prize of a gold cup, but then all the fish disperse on seeing a fish-hook descend, which catches on the bed and draws it and the humans to the surface. There they meet a talking bear, who takes them to meet the King's secretary (a secretary bird): the King (a lion) is in a dreadful rage because there is no-one to referee his football match. Mr. Browne volunteers. The football match, between the King's team, the 'Dirty Yellows' (lion, hyena, gorilla, warthog, crocodile, rhinoceros), and the 'True Blues' (ostrich, elephant, cheetah, hippopotamus, kangaroo - yes, there are more players on the King's side) then takes place, the King scoring the winning goal, and Mr. Browne getting thoroughly beaten up, although not fatally injured, to the disappointment of the medical staff (vultures). After the match Mr. Browne pulls the ""gypsy switch"" on the King, substituting his referee's whistle for the Star of Astaroth round the King's neck: the humans then leave pursued by the King as soon as he realizes what has occurred, who is turned into a rabbit by Ms. Price.Back in Pepperinge Eye, Miss Price asks for the Star, but as it has come from another world, it has evaporated: however Paul finds the five magic words of the substitutiary locomotion spell on a picture of the Star in his children's book. Miss Price tries out the spell, which animates clothing, with initially uncontrolled effect (also affecting the hat of the local curate, Mr. Jelk (Roddy McDowall): song: 'Substitutiary Locomotion'). Mrs. Hobday arrives to inform Miss Price that alternative accommodation has been found for the children - which saddens them. Mr. Browne, fearing a family type commitment, also decides he should return to London, and goes to the station to await the milk-train.However, a troop of German soldiers under the command of Colonel Heller (John Ericson) have landed from a U-boat (submarine) on a raid, and take over Miss Price's cottage for their headquarters. She and the children are taken to the local castle, now a museum, and locked in: they are joined by Mr. Browne, who has also spotted the Germans and managed to turn himself into a white rabbit in order to escape. Using the substitutiary locomotion spell, Miss Price animates the entire contents of the museum, some hundreds of costumes of Vikings, Knights, Cavaliers, Hussars etc., plus drums, trumpets and a trio of bagpipe players, and launches these against the Germans, herself directing them from her broomstick. The Germans, including their sergeant (Rick Traeger) are driven with numerous comic effects back to the U-Boat, although they detonate explosives which destroy Miss Price's magical laboratory. Miss Price is slightly injured, at which the whole substitutiary locomotion activated army collapses. The Home Guard arrive to see the Germans leaving, and to claim the victory. The movie ends with the children remaining with Miss Price, and Mr. Browne joining the army but vowing to return, escorted by the Home Guard (song: 'Old Home Guard')."

Six months after the disappearance of Tuscarora, PA businessman Tom Gruneman, his boss, Peter Cable, and his wife, Holly Gruneman, hire Tom's friend, private detective John Klute to find out what happened to Tom, as the police have been unable to do so, and despite John having no expertise in missing persons cases. The only lead is a typewritten obscene letter Tom purportedly wrote to Manhattan actress/model/call girl Bree Daniel, who admits to having received such letters from someone, and since having received several mysterious telephone calls as well. The suggestion/belief is that Tom was one of Bree's past johns, although she has no recollection of him when shown his photograph. Bree's tricking is both a compulsion and a financial need. In their initial encounters, John and Bree do whatever they can to exert their psychological dominance over the other, especially as Bree initially refused to even speak to him. Despite their less than friendly start, they embark on a personal relationship based on emotional need, but it is a relationship Bree tries to sabotage because of those same issues which causes her to turn tricks. As they follow the leads through Bree's call girl world, they know they're getting close to finding the truth when someone continues to torment Bree. They believe the key to Tom's disappearance is a violent john who tried to kill her a few years earlier when Tom disappeared but who she doesn't remember. The questions become whether John and Bree can discover his identity and stop him before he tries to kill Bree again, and whether there is a future for them together.—Huggo John Klute's friend has totally disappeared. The only clue is a connection with a New York call girl, Bree Daniels. Klute taps her phone in order to gain leverage to blackmail her into helping him find his friend. While Klute searches for his missing friend someone is stalking Bree.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> When his old friend, the laboratory engineer Tom Gruneman, vanishes, detective John Klute is hired by Tom's colleague Peter Cable to search for him. The unique lead is an obscene letter allegedly written by Tom to a call-girl in New York called Bree Daniels, and Klute moves to the Big Apple to investigate the disappearance of Tom. Klute blackmails Bree to help him to find other prostitutes that might have information using some tapes of her phone calls that he had secretly recorded. They realize that someone is stalking Bree, while Klute falls in love for Bree and she has some sort of feeling that she can not understand for him.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil After a businessman disappears the police draw a blank except for a dirty letter found in his desk written to a New York call-girl. His small-town friend John Klute travels to the big city to seek her out. At first their relationship is wary, and she sees him as just another guy to manipulate. But someone seems to be stalking her, and Klute's activities add to the danger as a bond of sorts starts to grow between the couple.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda) is a prostitute in New York City who aspires to be a model/actress. Along with Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page, she used to work for pimp Frank Ligourin (Roy Scheider). Bree quits working full-time as a prostitute after a serious encounter with a violent customer.The movie opens with Tom Gruneman and his wife hosting a social gathering at their house in Tuscarora, Pennsylvania. Their guests include Tom's colleague Peter Cable (Charles Cioffi) and Tom's friend/policeman John Klute (Donald Sutherland).Soon after, Tom Gruneman disappears without a trace and the police perform an investigation. They find an obscene letter to Bree Daniels at Gruneman's office in his desk. Daniels is contacted and she confirms that she had received several such letters but does not recognize Tom when shown a photograph. Daniels is arrested for prostitution. When released, she severs her relationship with Ligourin and begins to freelance and make her own contacts with customers. She leaves Park Avenue and moves into a small apartment and begins to worry that someone is following her.After six months of investigating Tom Gruneman's disappearance, the Police are at a dead end. Peter Cable hires John Klute to go to New York City and continue the investigation.Klute moves into a basement apartment in the same building where Daniels lives. He taps her telephone and records her telephone conversations. He then contacts Daniels and asks for her help in solving Gruneman's disappearance. Although initially reluctant, Daniels eventually cooperates with the persistent Klute who provides her protection from whomever is stalking her. Bree tries to manipulate Klute using sex but eventually she actually comes to care for him when he helps her get away from her former pimp.Klute learns that Jane McKenna (one of Frank Ligourin's former prostitutes at the time Bree was with him) apparently committed suicide. Then Aryln Page, another prostitute from Bree's past, whom Klute tracks down and also fails to recognize Tom's picture, is subsequently found dead.As Klute's investigation continues, it becomes evident that:
(1) The same man mistreated Bree Daniels and the other two prostitutes of Frank Ligourin;
(2) The man used Tom Gruneman's name when he was with the prostitutes;
(3) The man murdered Jane McKenna and Arlyn Page and probably Tom Gruneman
Klute eventually investigates Tom's friends and identifies Peter Cable based on the typewriter used to type the obscene letters and his writing style and consistent typing errors.The killer is not a mystery to viewers as Peter Cable is shown several times throughout the movie listening to tapes he had recorded of the sexual encounters and murders on a small tape recorder.
It is unclear why Cable thought it necessary to try to frame Gruneman (by planting the letter to Daniels in Gruneman's desk) or why Cable hired Klute to continue the investigation when the police had come to a dead end.Cable follows and attempts to kill Daniels, but Klute arrives just in time to save Daniels and Cable falls out the window to his death.Daniels moves out of her apartment to go with Klute who she has fallen in love with although she doubts she will be able to convert to a domestic life."

John Shaft is the ultimate in suave Black detectives. He first finds himself up against Bumpy, the leader of the Black crime mob, then against Black nationals, and finally working with both against the White Mafia who are trying to blackmail Bumpy by kidnapping his daughter.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Private detective John Shaft is hired by Harlem mobster Bumpy Jonas to find his kidnapped daughter. Bumpy has no idea who could have taken her but isn't as forthcoming as he could be about his situation. When his first lead peters out--he thought it might be Black Power advocates who took her--he acts on information from NYPD Lt. Vic Androzzi that outside mobsters are in town and might be trying to take over various illegal businesses in Harlem.—garykmcd John Shaft is a Black private detective working in downtown New York City. He learns the hard way that Bumpy Jonas, a Harlem-based Black mobster, wants to hire him to locate his daughter, Marcy Jonas, whom Bumpy claims was kidnapped, there being no ransom note. All Bumpy can tell Shaft is that he believes that a mid-level Harlem Black thug named Ben Buford, who is known now to be lying low, is either behind the kidnapping or knows something about it. Because of his criminal history, Bumpy can't go to the police for their help, and he chooses Shaft because he has his hands on the pulse of both the Black and the white communities in inner-city New York. Despite not liking the way that Bumpy contacted him, Shaft agrees to the job in part because he can see that Bumpy has true concern for his daughter, a probable innocent in the matter. Even before having the conversation with Bumpy, Shaft is contacted by NYPD Lieutenant Vic Androzzi--with whom he has a love/hate relationship--who wants Shaft to tell him what he knows about what's going on with Bumpy, if only to prepare for any potential bloodshed that might be happening down the pike. As Shaft knows Vic isn't being totally forthright with him, he must decide how much of what he knows he will divulge to Vic as the case progresses. As Shaft progresses with the case, following the only leads of Marcy's last-known whereabouts and trails to Buford's current hiding place, Shaft will learn why Bumpy believes Buford is involved.

After Androzzi leaves, Shaft spots one of the men waiting for him in his office building. He commandeers the first gangster, forcing him into his office where the second gangster is waiting. After a quick fight, Shaft dodges one of them who goes out the window, while the other surrenders and reveals to him that Bumpy Jonas, the leader of a Harlem-based organized crime family, wanted Shaft brought uptown to Harlem for a meeting.At the police station, Shaft lies to Lt. Androzzi and the detective assigned to the second gangster's death at Shaft's office, by saying that his friend was in an ""accident"". He is allowed to return to the streets for 48 hours before the police decide to question him again. Shaft arranges a meeting with Bumpy, the leader of these gangsters, in his office. It turns out Bumpy's daughter has been kidnapped, and Shaft is asked to ensure her safe return.After tracking down Ben Buford as Bumpy suggested, a big shoot out ensues; Shaft is told by Vic after the shooting that Shaft himself, and not Ben, was the target, and that tensions brewing between the uptown hoods belonging to Bumpy Jonas and the downtown Mafiosi have culminated in a couple of murders. But the perception is black against white to the general public, with the possibility of an escalation into full-blown race war on the streets of the city. He also shows Shaft some pictures of two of the Mafia men who just arrived in New York. Vic begs Shaft to explain what's going on, although Vic already knew Bumpy was looking for Shaft.Streetwise, Shaft surmises that mobsters are watching his pad from a local bar. Shaft pretends to be a barkeep and calls the police to have the mobsters arrested. Shaft later goes to the police station to set a meeting to find where Bumpy's daughter is being held captive.Vic tells Shaft that the room that he was in at the station house was bugged and he is supposed to bring him in for questioning, but instead leaves. Ben and Shaft go to the apartment where Marcy Jonas is being held to make sure she's alive. Once there, a gunfight ensues during which two hoods get killed and Shaft takes a bullet in the shoulder.Shaft goes home and receives medical attention from a doctor working underground with him. Shaft tells Ben to round up his men and meet him at the hotel where Marcy has been taken, to prepare to get her back. He also calls Bumpy to tell him his daughter is fine and he is going to need some taxicabs to meet him at the hotel for the getaway.Shaft's plan resembles a military commando-style operation. That evening, Ben's men all dress as hotel workers to avoid arousing suspicion. Shaft and one of Ben's men go to the roof and prepare to enter the room where Marcy is being held captive. Shaft's plan is to cause a distraction with an explosive thrown through the window of Marcy's room while Ben and his men come down the hall and deal with the Mafia men as they leave their rooms.The rescue plan is successful. Marcy is spirited out of the hotel into one of the waiting taxicabs. As the others get away in the remaining cabs, Shaft walks to a phone booth to call Vic. Shaft informs Vic as a result of the rescue there will be a huge mess to fix between the uptown crew and the mob in the near future. Vic says to close it for him, meaning he wants Shaft to fix the trouble. Shaft replies, ""You're gonna have to close it yourself shitty"" then hangs up the phone as he walks away laughing."
Big Jake,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066831/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1909, when John Fain's gang kidnaps Jacob McCandles' grandson and holds him for ransom, Big Jake sets out to rescue the boy. McCandles Ranch is run over by a gang of cutthroats led by the evil John Fain. They kidnap little Jacob McCandles and hold him for one million dollars ransom. There is only one man brave enough, tough enough, and smart enough to bring him back alive, and that man is Big Jake.—Christopher D. Ryan <cryan@direct.ca> In the waning days of the wild old West, in 1909 Texas, the murderous gang of the vicious cut-throat, John Fain, raid the vast Jake and Martha McCandles' ranch--and after indiscriminately slaughtering men, women, and children--they abduct their eight-year-old grandson. To help track down the kidnapped boy, and to deliver the massive one-million-dollar ransom, Martha sends for her estranged husband to venture out into an unforgiving land where neither the mighty Texas Rangers nor the army dare to enter. With a sturdy strongbox crammed with cash, a loyal Indian scout friend, and his faithful Collie dog, the experienced grandfather sets out on a dangerous rescue mission against the armed-to-the-teeth killers. Will Big Jake give them a taste of his swift justice?—Nick Riganas Big Jake McCandles is on the trail of a gang of cutthroat criminals in this action drama which stretches from Texas to Mexico. It's 1909, and the Old West is giving way to modern times. When the outlaw gang led by evil John Fain raids the McCandles' family ranch, kidnapping his 8-year-old grandson, wife Martha, whom he hasn't seen in many years, sends for her husband to bring the boy back alive. While the law gives chase in newfangled, rickety automobiles, Jake saddles up with an Indian scout, his faithful dog, and a box of money. But paying ransom isn't Jake's idea of good old frontier justice.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> A narrator explains that the year is 1909, and that on the east coast, technology, fashion, the arts, and other versions of progress are all the rage. However, the west, while not untouched by the winds of change, is still a fairly untamed and dangerous land. A perfect example of this situation is given when former soldier and notorious train and bank robber John Fain (Richard Boone) leads a band of old-fashioned gunfighters and rustlers onto the land owned by Jacob ""Big Jake"" McCandles (John Wayne) and his estranged wife Martha (Maureen O'Hara).Jake, a wanderer notorious for his gun-slinging skills and his prodigious wealth, has ridden around the west on various business matters with his faithful unnamed dog, and not been home in nearly a decade. Martha runs the ranch, which has an almost East-coast-style house with servants, with the help of their three sons, Jeffrey (Bobby Vinton), James (Patrick Wayne), and Michael (Christopher Mitchum) . Jeffrey himself has a son, whom Martha has insisted be named Jacob ""Little Jake"" McCandles (Ethan Wayne), after his grandfather.Fain's group arrives on the busy, bustling ranch on a day when most of the men are off on a roundup, leaving the house relatively unprotected save the servants and a few young men out in the yard trying to bust a bronco. Martha sends her foreman Bert (John Agar) to talk to them, but he doesn't like the look of them, and when Fain claims they are looking for work he curtly tells them to go away. Fain refuses to leave, rambling on about how much money it would have taken to build the place. When Bert demands to know what it is Fain really wants, Fain, who wears a long Mexican-style Poncho, draws a gun that was hidden in it and shoots Bert dead. The gunshot throws the house into chaos and the raiders use it to their advantage, riding around and shooting or knifing anything they see moving, even killing a small servant boy and his older sister. Jeffrey runs out with his gun but is shot three times, collapsing on the porch. Fain actually rides his horse through the double-doors into the house, shooting one of the cooks. Martha grabs a shotgun to fight back, but stops when Fain warns her that if he dies, Little Jake - who has run to the stable to hide - will also be killed.Outside, half-Indian gunslinger ""Breed"" O'Brien (Glenn Corbett) tracks Little Jake to the stable house and captures him. Little Jake stabs him in the face with a pitchfork, and in rage O'Brien almost shoots the boy, but Fain rides up and stops him, reminding him their plan is to kidnap Little Jake for ransom. The group rides off, callously throwing the ransom note on Jeffrey's bloodied body as they ride past him and Martha. Martha reads it, discovers the kidnappers want a million dollars for Jake's safe return, and after getting Jeffrey care from the local doctor, sends for her other sons. The Army and the Rangers are also notified and offer to carry the box to the place on the map Fain left. However, Martha, who has a plot of her own, reluctantly sends for Big Jake instead, believing he is the only man 'harsh and unpleasant' enough to deal with the killers.Big Jake, who just rescued an innocent Scottish shepherd from being lynched and hung by his cattle-owning neighbors, hires the grateful man and sends him to a property he has 200 miles south, to sell the sheep. One of the lynching party says he thought Jacob McCandles had died long ago, which irritates Big Jake considerably. As Jake rides away from the herd of sheep, a messenger arrives with Martha's summons. Jake takes the next train back home immediately, where he is greeted by Martha, who explains the situation. Jake asks if Martha has raised the million dollars and she says she already has many times that. He looks in the strongbox Martha has set on the table in front of him - the camera does not show the money, and Jake asks her, after an incredulous look at the contents of the box, if this is what she wants. Martha tells Jake that lots of people died in the raid, many of which he knew, and she believes the killers should be given 'exactly what they asked for'. Jake agrees. Martha gives him the weapons and supplies and horses she has waiting for him, as well as a mule to carry the strongbox.Jake goes outside the train station to encounter a group of Rangers, with new, state-of-the-art REO automobiles. After expressing surprise Jake is still alive after all these years, they offer to ride along with Jake and help him retrieve his grandson, but Jake tells them he'd rather not risk their lives. He sends a messenger to fetch someone named Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot). He then meets his son James, who is more than a little embittered at his father's absence and expresses his displeasure almost immediately, repeatedly and derisively calling Jake ""Daddy"". Jake decides to teach him a lesson by throwing him off his horse and into a mud puddle, much to Martha's amusement. James tries to throw a punch and is knocked back in the mud. Jake tells him he can come along but that he'd better use his gun better than he fights if he hopes to stay alive. He also warns James he'll knock him cold if he calls him ""Daddy"" again. The group is about to set off when James' brother Michael arrives on his own state-of-the-art machine - a motorcycle. Unlike James, Michael is delighted to see his father again and is also much more gentlemanly of manner. Jake is less than thrilled to see Michael, however, as the motorcycle spooked the horses and Jake ended up being thrown into the same mud puddle James was in a few minutes earlier.Michael tells the rangers he saw the kidnappers heading for a canyon and that he thinks the cars can outrun them. Martha decides, against Jake's wishes, to take the gamble and send Michael and the rangers to ambush the kidnappers in the canyon. James recants his desire to ride with Jake and goes with the rangers. Martha and Jake have a falling out over this - remembering why it was they were estranged in the first place, as their personalities clash - but Martha tells Jake to still ride off, and that if they fail, it's up to him to bring the boy in. Jake rides off to meet Sam Sharpnose, who is an elderly Apache Indian and an old hunting buddy of his. Sam brought a saddle and puts it on one of the horses, riding off with Jake.Many miles ahead, James is riding with the rangers in one of the cars. Michael goes ahead of them and scouts, but this time can't see the kidnappers. He returns and rides alongside the lead car, shouting to its driver that he can't find the kidnappers but still thinks they should chance the pass. James agrees it's a good idea, but one of the rangers (Chuck Roberson) reminds them that, not knowing if they're ahead of or behind the kidnappers, it's a potentially deadly gamble. However, Buck (John Doucette), the leader of the rangers, says he wants to get the boy back safely to his mother and will take any risk necessary.Unfortunately for them, the first ranger was right in his assumption. The kidnappers are ahead of them and have set up an ambush of their own, and fire a rain of bullets and buckshot on the rescue party. One car crashes into a gully, the other two have their tires blown, and several rangers are injured or killed. The eldest of the gang, Pop Dawson (Harry Carey, Jr.) suggests that with the group unable to follow them, they can call off the attack. Fain insists they murder as many as they can before they leave, to convince the McCandles' to cough up the money. Michael recklessly drives his motorcycle in amongst the kidnappers to distract them. They fire at and narrowly miss him, and he rides by the horses, trying to spook them. Fain realizes what Michael is trying to do and calls off the ambush, his gang fleeing to the horses. In the commotion, Little Jake manages to work his bonds loose and flee. Unfortunately, O'Brien sees him, and for a second time captures him. Michael's motorcycle is disabled from riding over the rough terrain, and he disappears over the edge of the canyon.Big Jake and Sam arrive on the scene. Jake tells Buck that he has little sympathy for him - he made it clear he disapproved of the risky plan back at the train station, but Buck went along with it, and nearly got Little Jake killed in doing so. He gives them some supplies but can't spare any of his horses, and tells them he'll send a telegraph back to their office when he gets to the next town. He also warns Buck that if he finds out the kidnappers have done away with Little Jake, he'll come back and kill him. James reluctantly rides along with his father, but is in even a worse humor than before. Sam reminds him that, like it or not, Jake is more experienced and knows what he's doing. They find Michael's motorcycle crashed at the bottom of the canyon and fear he may be dead. However, when they arrive, Michael's ""body"" stands up and cheerfully greets Jake, saying he just lay still because he thought it was the kidnappers coming down the canyon. Jake demands Michael remove his motorcycle goggles. A confused Michael complies and Big Jake promptly punches him twice in the face - once for scaring him to death and the other for being overeager and nearly getting Little Jake killed. Michael refuses to be bitter, instead ruefully smiling and telling his father that next time he'll just leave the goggles on so he can't hit him.The two boys join their father and ride off, following the map the kidnappers drew on the ransom note. Along the way, more friction arises between James and his father, though Michael tries to calm it down. The situation comically worsens when Jake discovers James has been limping because, during the shootout with the kidnappers, someone with a sense of humor plugged him in the backside. Jake, with the help of his dog and Sam, forces James to undress so he can tend the wound.The next day, Sam, an excellent tracker, determines that they're getting close to the kidnappers. He also presents James and Michael with saddles for their horses, saying he ""found"" them (implying he stole them). Jake says he suspects they may be followed, so Sam rides back to check and returns with news that they have someone following them a few hours behind - he could hear their horses' hoof beats. Jake orders that Sam rests his horse. He also has James take the horses, dog, and the mule with the strongbox for water. He notices Michael has a new gas-powered handgun with a magazine handle. Having never seen an automatic handgun before, he wonders if it's any good. Michael explains it's a preproduction Bergman that was given to the family because they own some stock. Jake asks Michael if he can shoot and Michael says proficiently. However, he seems alarmed when Jake asks him to fire the automatic handgun, and proceeds to demonstrate, by wildly firing all over the place thanks to the recoil, that he has no idea how to use it. After rescuing the mule, which ran off, and assuring Sam and James and Dog they can come out of hiding, Jake confronts Michael. Michael then explains that what he shoots proficiently with is a high-powered rifle with a telescopic scope, and demonstrates his prowess on a deer a quarter of a mile away, when Jake asks him to kill it for meat. James takes the handgun from Michael and starts practicing with it, enjoying the feel of it.That night, in camp, James again harasses Jake, trying to get even with him for running out on them. Jake tells James that he is making up some the things he's accusing him of, and Michael backs him up, causing James to go outside the camp and sulk. Sam alerts Jake that someone is approaching the camp from the front, and though their followers are still a couple hours behind them. Sam offers to kill the intruder, but a shocked Michael, who doesn't believe in killing except when absolutely necessary, protests. Jake reluctantly lets the intruder into the camp while Sam, James, and Michael go hide. The intruder turns out to be Fain, who rides into the camp alone. He pretends to be just the messenger boy for the kidnappers, giving Jake the boy's undershirt as a guarantee of good faith. He then tells Jake that the gang is waiting for them in the next town, and asks to see the money in the box. Jake refuses, saying Fain can help himself to the box once they have the boy. Fain demands to know who Jake is and if the boy means anything to him, but Jake only tells him that he was hired by the McCandles. Fain then warns Jake that they are indeed being followed by bandits intent on stealing the box, but these bandits aren't with the kidnappers. He also tells Jake that if the bandits get the box, he and the others won't wait but will kill the boy and send his body back home through the post. Jake tells him he'll heed the warning, and Fain rides off into the night.Sam tells Jacob that two of the bandits have crept closer to the camp than he thought, and have surely overheard where they're taking the box. Jake, much to Michael's horror, orders Sam to kill them before they report back. Sam and the dog sneak back into the trees to attack the spies. Sam manages to knife one but the dog is unable to bring down the other, and he escapes, though badly mauled. Jake knows this means the bandits will ride ahead of them through the night and lay a trap for them in the town, and they make preparations to deal with the threat.The next day, they arrive in the town only to discover a huge fiesta is going on because a large group of oil drillers is in town. This will make protecting the box and picking the bandits out from the crowd harder. Instead of trying to sneak in, they ride boldly down the street with all their guns out and the box in plain sight. Jake explains to a skeptical James that this shows the bandits that, at least for now, they can't have the box and buys them some time. They check into the local hotel, and once again Jake has to deal with someone incredulous he's still alive. He swears he'll shoot at the next person who says he's supposed to be dead. Michael suggests they hole up in the hotel room and wait for the bandits to make a move, but Jake says he'd rather be proactive and get the bandits first. Michael protests, and Sam tells him to shut up and let Jake do the planning, as Michael's good intentions have already cost some lives. Jake lays out the plan of campaign to the boys, and they take a rest until dark.That night, the plan is put into action. James goes down and joins the fiesta in the saloon, dancing and enjoying himself. Sam goes out to check on the horses in the stable, and Jake grabs a pack of supplies and his shotgun, all rolled up in a blanket, and goes for a walk. Michael is left alone with the dog and the box. Naturally, the bandits begin to close in on them. Jake walks into the saloon where James is and picks a fight with the biggest man he can find. The brawl spills onto the street and everyone's eyes are on it. This gives Sam time to sneak over the roof of the hotel and into the room with Michael, and the two use the mattress to barricade the door. Jake then halts the brawl by apologizing to the man he attacked, claiming he mistook him for someone else. He leaves the saloon, and the fiesta continues. He goes into the barbershop, sees 'hot showers' advertised, and goes to the back to take one. A bandit immediately goes back, sees the roll of supplies and clothes on a bench, and proceeds to hold Jake at gunpoint, believing him naked and unprotected. Two of the Bandits try to rile James up to get him to start a shootout with them, so he can't go protect his brother and the box. Impressively, the normally hot-tempered James manages to stay calm long enough to buy some time, before drawing his automatic handgun and dispatching both bandits with ease. At the same time, the remaining three bandits converge on the hotel. The dog knocks one down the stairs, breaking his neck, and Sam and Michael kill the other two after a brief firefight. The bandit in the barbershop, hearing the firefight, thinks his men have killed Michael and gloats to Jake. However, Jake had taken his gun in the shower with him and rolled the pack back up to look like the shotgun was still in it. He fires the shotgun through the door of the shower, killing the last bandit.Jake returns to the hotel to make sure everyone is all right and is confronted by an enraged Michael. One of the killers blasted open the box in the firefight, and Michael has discovered there are newspaper clippings in it instead of money. James sees the clippings, and immediately begins calling Jake ""Daddy"" again, angrily demanding where the money is. Both sons are convinced Jake has stolen it, and that they risked their lives and killed those men for nothing. After letting both take out their anger by hitting him as hard as they can, Jake engages them in a proper fistfight knocks them out cold, wakes them with water, and manages to get them to calm down. He explains to them that Martha put the clippings there because, as she said, she wanted the kidnappers to get ""exactly what they asked for"" - death. She wants Jake to kill the kidnappers, not pay them for all the death and misery they caused. The boys are skeptical at first, until Jake reminds them their brother Jeffrey is on death's door because of the kidnappers. Realizing that this is indeed something their mother would do, though still a bit shocked by it, Michael expresses concern that they won't be able to pull of the gamble.Once the town has settled for the night, Pop Dawson comes to the hotel room. Michael goes through the window onto the roof when he hears him coming. Dawson doesn't notice Michael is gone, and tells Jake that they have the boy nearby and that they are to follow him, and that if he doesn't get back in 18 minutes Fain will kill Little Jake. He also tells Jake that they are not to move from the trade spot until an hour after the trade or the boy will die. Jake asks how they could possibly accomplish this if they have the money and he has the boy, and Dawson says that they have a sharpshooter of their own, Duffy (Dean Smith), who will be set up like a sniper in a secret location with a telescopic scope and a bead on Little Jake. If anything goes wrong, he has orders to fire, and will be too far away for the kidnappers to stop him. Jake asks Dawson for five minutes to get dressed and ready and Dawson agrees, going out back to wait. Michael comes back in and Big Jake orders him to sneak in unseen and shoot the sniper. They head downstairs, leaving Michael behind. Dawson suspects a trick at once, but Jake tells him Michael was killed when they were fighting the bandits. When Dawson demands to see his body, Jake reminds him all the bodies are laid out in the jailhouse and tells him he's welcome to go have a look if he likes. This seems plausible to Dawson, who is a wanted man and won't go near the jailhouse anyway, and he leads them off through the deserted streets as thunderclouds begin to roll in. Michael waits until they are a good distance away, then creeps along unseen in the shadows behind them.Dawson leads them to an old stables next to an old church. Two dead night watchmen proclaim the kidnappers have already been here and claimed the place as their own. Dawson orders James and Sam to stop where they are, and tells Jake to take the box in alone. Pop Dawson then rides off and hides in the shadows himself. James notices O'Brien also watching them from the shadows and warns Jake to be careful. Jake tells Sam they'll have to go up to Montana and hunt elk sometime after this thing is over, indicating he fully intends the plan to come off. Michael sneaks in alongside Jake, unseen by the kidnappers, and then climbs an old silo, setting up his own sniper's nest and looking for the other sharpshooter.Jake is met by Fain, this time left in no doubt that Fain is the head of the gang. Two of the kidnappers try to sneak up on him, but the mule kicks one and the dog attacks the other. Jake then notices that Fain's younger brother Will (Robert Warner) is up on a wall, aiming a shotgun at him. He jokingly tells Fain that they must figure he's a real dangerous man and Fain, appreciating the humor, tells Will he can get down from the wall. Jake then refuses to hand over the money until Fain shows him the boy. Will and a machete wielding thug named Goodfellow (Gregg Palmer) bring a horse bearing Little Jake out into the light. The boy is bound and hooded. In the belltower of the church, the sniper takes aim at Little Jake's heart, ready to fire should anything go wrong. Michael, however, still can't see him in the dark. Jake orders the hood to be removed so he knows it's the right boy and that he's not hurt. The hood is taken off, and for the first time Big Jake gets to see his grandson in person. He allows a smile to go across his face, and Fain takes that as a sign Jake has something planned. He immediately warns Jake that if anything goes wrong - ""your fault, my fault, nobody's fault"" - Will has orders to blow Little Jake's head off with the shotgun. He also reminds Jake that even if Will is hurt, Duffy can still take him out with the rifle, so no matter what happens, if anything goes wrong, the boy dies.Jake throws the key to Fain and tells him to open the strongbox himself, seemingly disgusted. Fain picks it up and cockily opens the box, kneeling down to take a look at it. This puts him in a vulnerable position. He sees the clippings, looks up in rage, and sees that Big Jake has the shotgun aimed right at his head. The lid of the box blocks this from the view of the rest of the kidnappers. Big Jake whispers to him that it's Fain's turn to follow orders, and that if anything goes wrong, it's Fain that will have his head blown off.For a moment, it seems the victory will be easy, but then a gunslinger named Trooper (Jim Burk) , who was behind Jake unbeknownst, leaps over the nearby wagon and jumps him. Fain escapes and gives the order to kill the boy, but Big Jake kills Will before he can shoot, and the dog pulls the boy off the horse, making the rifle miss and hit Big Jake in the leg instead. Fain shoots the dog, Big Jake fights Trooper off, and a gunfight ensues between the remaining kidnappers and Big Jake, who manages to get himself and his grandson to cover behind some hay bales. Michael spots Duffy by his powder flare and shoots the bells in the tower, making him jump up and be more visible. He then shoots Duffy, who falls from the tower. Fain sends Goodfellow to check on Will, but he's dead. Further enraged at his brother's death, Fain orders Goodfellow to get the shotgun from Will and they continue firing at Big Jake. Sam shoots Trooper from the top of a wall before he can kill Jake, but Fain knocks Sam off the wall with a shot, and Goodfellow brutally hacks the wounded man to death with the machete. Michael then climbs down from the silo, but drops his rifle in the process and has to go look for it.Behind the haystack, Little Jake, still unaware of his rescuer's identity, helps him tie up the wound on his leg. Jake gives him a tiny Deringer gun from his belt and tells Little Jake to run for it, and meet James outside. He then creates a distraction by firing, and the boy runs outside. Goodfellow, Dawson, and O'Brien pursue him. James kills Dawson and little Jake shoots at Goodfellow but misses, and O'Brien wounds James. Little Jake runs to the stables and hides behind a column. Goodfellow spots his shadow and runs after him, but the wounded dog jumps him and mauls him into a bloody mess. Goodfellow manages to get the dog off and hack him to death, same as Sam, but Little Jake is now nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, O'Brien, who likes old-fashioned gun duels, decides to have a little fun with James. He knows James only has one working arm now, and teasingly challenges him to a fight. However, James has now mastered the fast-firing automatic, and when O'Brien goes for his gun he blasts four bullets through him.Fain and Goodfellow are now the only two kidnappers left. James is still outside and Michael and Little Jake are nowhere to be seen. Big Jake decides to make a run for it, throwing a lantern at Fain and catching the signature Poncho on fire. While Fain is putting it out, Big Jake goes to the stables to make sure his grandson is all right. He finds Goodfellow tearing apart a haystack, in which the boy is hiding, but he hasn't found the boy yet. The big man charges Jake with the machete, as Jake shoots only to find he is out of bullets, but Jake grabs the nearest thing to hand - a pitchfork - and impales him on it. He then grabs his grandson, but Fain rides in on his horse, aiming at both of them and gloating that he's going to kill them both. Michael saves the day, appearing over the wall with his rifle and blowing Fain off his horse. Before he dies, Fain one last time demands to know just who his adversary is. Jake tells him the truth this time, and Fain collapses, his last words being that, like others before him, he had heard Big Jake was dead already, much to Big Jake's irritation.Little Jake, hearing the name ""Jacob McCandles"", is delighted to realize his savior is his grandfather. Michael apologizes for being a bit slow and allowing his father to get wounded, but Jake reassures him that he saved his life twice that night and has nothing to be sorry for. Little Jake asks and gets confirmation that Big Jake is indeed his grandfather, and James, nursing his wounded arm but much matured by the experience, appears on the scene. He respectfully addresses Jake as ""Dad"" and suggests they all go home, to which Jake replies that is a good idea."
The French Connection,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067116/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A pair of NYPD detectives in the Narcotics Bureau stumble onto a heroin smuggling ring based in Marseilles, but stopping them and capturing their leaders proves an elusive goal. William Friedkin's gritty police drama portrays two tough New York City cops trying to intercept a huge heroin shipment coming from France. An interesting contrast is established between 'Popeye' Doyle, a short-tempered alcoholic bigot who is nevertheless a hard-working and dedicated police officer, and his nemesis Alain Charnier, a suave and urbane gentleman who is nevertheless a criminal and one of the largest drug suppliers of pure heroin to North America. During the surveillance and eventual bust, Friedkin provides one of the most gripping and memorable car chase sequences ever filmed.—Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle and Buddy Russo are Brooklyn-based NYPD narcotics detectives who often work undercover. They make a lot of arrests, but they are all of small time users, busting who which makes no dent in the NYC drug trade. While the two are out for drinks one night at a club, Popeye sees a table of people which to him doesn't seem right, the people who include an unknown ""big spender"" out of his league next to known organized drug criminals. Just for fun, they decide to tail the big spender and his girl. Beyond the couple's obvious suspicious activity, they find out that they are Sal and Angie Boca, small time crooks who own and operate a Brooklyn newsstand/luncheonette. Based on other evidence including information from one of their snitches of rumors of a major drug shipment entering New York, Popeye and Buddy get the official albeit reluctant OK from their superior to surveil Sal to find if he leads them to the incoming drug shipment, that surveillance including authorization for wiretaps. That surveillance does show that Sal is connected and that the probable persons selling the drugs are two Frenchmen having recently arrived in the city. It then becomes a game of cat and mouse as Sal and the two Frenchmen, Alain Charnier and his muscle Pierre Nicoli, are aware that they are being tailed, the two Frenchmen in particular who are willing to go to any lengths to protect their investment, estimated street worth of approximately $32 million. Popeye, Buddy and their third, Mulderig, who has an antagonistic relationship with Popeye due to Mulderig's belief that Popeye's police work led to the death of a colleague, have to learn when the lead is not the three men but the locale of the drugs themselves.—Huggo Popeye Doyle and Buddy Russo get wind of a big shipment of heroin and begin a tail of the suspects, and their French Connection, two French nationals who are the european link. As money troubles begin for the hoods they decide to kill Popeye and Buddy to give them enough room to bring in the heroin. A combination of police procedural and action/car chase.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Police partners Doyle and Russo put a candy store under surveillance based on a hunch that something fishy was going on. Eventually it turns out that the proprietors are involved in one of the biggest narcotics smuggling rings on either side of the Atlantic, and the cops go to work.—Philip Brubaker <coda@nando.net> In December 1970 in Marseilles, France, a plainclothes policeman is observing former longshoreman turned entrepreneur Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) chatting with some unsavory types. Charnier is being tailed by the undercover cop because he is a kingpin in smuggling heroin overseas - a fact that costs the cop his life when he later returns home and is shot in the face by Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi), Charnier's henchman.Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, New York City, a corner Santa is chatting with some children outside a seedy bar while a hot dog vendor completes a transaction. The Santa is Detective Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and the vendor is his partner, Detective Salvatore Russo (Roy Scheider), whom Doyle nicknames ""Cloudy."" The two narcotics cops are staking out the bar in hope of finding a pusher named Willie (Alan Weeks). When Popeye sees Willie in the bar passing some drugs to a companion, he starts singing to the children, his signal to Cloudy. Cloudy enters the bar and grabs Willie's buddy. Willie sees the commotion and suddenly flees outside, with Popeye and Cloudy in hot pursuit. They corner him in an alley and Willie slashes Cloudy's arm with a hidden knife and runs. The cops chase him on foot to a deserted lot where he trips and falls and is beaten by both cops before Russo implores Doyle to stop. Once the two cops calm down they confusingly interrogate Willie, trying to get information on his drug connection.In France, Charnier finishes a day overseeing dock work and drives home to his seaside villa and his young trophy wife (Ann Rebbot), who obviously has expensive tastes. The two exchange gifts for their upcoming trip to the US. Charnier later meets his gunman Nicoli at a rendezvous point for an acquaintance of Charnier, TV personality Henri Devereaux (Frédéric de Pasquale). Devereaux is traveling to the US to make a film and has decided to aid Charnier's smuggling effort because he needs money. Nicoli believes involving Devereaux is a mistake, but is reassured by Charnier.In NYC, Popeye and Cloudy sign off for the night and Popeye takes his reluctant partner to a nightclub called The Chez. Popeye notices one table in particular, populated by known narcotics connections who are being entertained by a free-spending young man whom Popeye describes as a ""greaser."" Popeye smells a drug deal underway and persuades Cloudy to help him tail the greaser and his companion, a big-haired blonde. Throughout the night they tail the two, watching them drop off a suitcase in Little Italy and then switch cars early the next morning from an attractive coupe to a beat-up sedan. They then drive to a candy store/luncheonette, ""Sal and Angie's"", in a working-class area of Brooklyn. Peering inside as the couple prepares to open for the day, Popeye and Cloudy notice that the blonde is now a brunette, having worn a wig the night before.Realizing they are on to something, the two cops stake out the candy store for a week using audio surveillance. Cloudy poses as a photographer to question Angie. Combing records they find that the greaser is Salvatore ""Sal"" Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife is Angie (Arlene Farber). The candy store's income could not explain Sal's free-spending ways. The posh coupe is owned by Angie while the beat-up sedan is owned by Sal's brother Lou (Benny Marino), a garbageman in training at a facility on Ward's Island in the East River. All three Bocas have criminal records. The candy store is regularly visited by unsavory types from New Jersey, and Sal makes numerous trips to an expensive condo in Manhattan at which lives lawyer Joel Weinstock (Harold Gary), a known drug financier who bankrolled a heroin shipment from Mexico.Popeye and Cloudy raid a junk-house bar. One Afro-haired patron (Al Fann) talks back at Popeye and is hauled into a men's room to be beaten up - actually cover so Popeye can debrief his informant, who reveals that a big shipment is due within a few weeks that will satisfy everyone in the city. In order to make the ruse look convincing, Popeye punches his colleague in the jaw, a bit too enthusiastically.Popeye's boss, Walt Simonson (Eddie Egan, the real-life inspiration for Popeye Doyle), is reluctant to let the two cops continue with their investigation of Boca, pointedly reminding Popeye of a previous case where his hunches backfired. But with Joel Weinstock, whom the police have long wanted to arrest, potentially involved, Simonson relents and goes to court for a wiretap on Boca's house and candy store. The federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) now becomes involved and assigns Agents Bill Mulderig (Bill Hickman) and Bill Klein (Sonny Grosso, the real-life inspiration for Cloudy Russo), who've worked with Popeye before; Popeye and Mulderig are at constant loggerheads because Mulderig blames Popeye for the death of a policeman in a previous case and doesn't believe Popeye's hunches to begin with.Charnier, Nicoli, and Devereaux arrive in NYC and Devereaux brings with him Charnier's Lincoln, signed for in Charnier's stead. They speak fair English, but nonetheless have an interpreter, La Valle (Andre Ernotte), with them. La Valle escorts Charnier to a police auction of impounded cars and identifies Lou Boca as the scrap metal buyer for Charnier's business (suggesting how the Bocas may have linked up with Charnier).After several days of monitoring mundane conversations, the wiretap finally brings Popeye and Cloudy their first break - Charnier phones Sal to arrange a 12 o'clock meeting the next day. Popeye, Cloudy, and Mulderig tail Sal to midtown Manhattan, where they spot Sal meeting with Charnier and Nicoli. While Mulderig follows Sal, Popeye and Cloudy tail Charnier, dubbed ""Frog One,"" and Nicoli as they walk through the city. The Frenchmen stop to eat at an expensive restaurant, which the cops observe while standing outside in freezing temperatures and eating bad pizza with worse coffee. Later, Popeye finds out that Frog One is staying at the Westbury Hotel, but Mulderig still doesn't believe Popeye is on to anything, leading to a brief argument.At Joel Weinstock's condo, a young dope chemist (Pat McDermott) tests a sample of Charnier's heroin and it measures to 89% pure. There are sixty kilos due to arrive; when cut down into ""dime bags"" it will total out to $32 million with a half-million cash down payment. Weinstock, however, wants to wait before the switch is made, much to Sal's displeasure as Sal fears that Charnier will abort the deal if Weinstock drags it out too long.The next day Popeye arrives at the Westbury just in time to see Charnier breeze right by the distracted Mulderig and Klein and walk into the city without a tail. Popeye tails Charnier himself, almost loses him at a flower shop, but then picks him up again at the Grand Central subway station. They play a cat-and-mouse game on the platform, but the wily Charnier manages to hop back on a train at the last moment and waves goodbye as the furious Popeye futilely runs after the train.Charnier meets Sal in Washington DC - Sal followed there by Klein - where Charnier insists that the deal must be consummated by the end of the week, despite Sal's protests that his mob pals want to wait. On the flight back to New York, Charnier expresses his worries to Nicoli, who points out that Sal's concern about the police is warranted. The Frenchmen agree that Doyle is the main problem, and Nicoli volunteers to assassinate Doyle. Charnier reluctantly agrees, unaware that a fight has erupted between Popeye and Mulderig, and that Popeye has been taken off the case by a furious Simonson.The dejected Popeye returns to his Brooklyn apartment building, where he is fired upon by Nicoli from the roof. Popeye manages to enter the building and pursues Nicoli to the roof, and then back down when he sees Nicoli fleeing. Nicoli runs to a nearby elevated train station and boards the train while Popeye screams for a uniformed transit policeman on board to stop him. As the train leaves the station, the transit policeman follows Nicoli as he moves forward through the train. Popeye commandeers a Pontiac Le Mans from a flabbergasted citizen. Nicoli kills the transit cop and seizes the motorman, forcing him to keep the train going through all the regular stops. Popeye furiously pursues in the car, barely escaping as other cars sideswipe him, and he nearly strikes a woman pushing her child in a baby carriage. Nicoli then kills the conductor who tries to intervene, and the crowd on the train flees while the terrified motorman collapses with a heart attack, locking the train on a collision course with a stopped train. The two trains crash and passengers, including Nicoli, are thrown about. Despite injuries and losing his gun, Nicoli slips out undetected - by everyone except Popeye. Nicoli starts down the stairs but is cornered by Popeye, and when he tries to flee he is shot dead.Popeye and Cloudy, now back on the case, tail Sal as he takes the Lincoln from a parking garage to a side street. The police stake out the car all night; at 4:10 AM a gang of thieves tries to strip it, but they are arrested by a horde of policemen and the car is towed to a garage to be searched as evidence. The mechanic (Irving Abrahams), cannot find any narcotics in the car, but Popeye refuses to believe it. While Devereaux (who signed for the car) and La Valle argue with the garage desk sergeant, Cloudy notices a 120-pound discrepancy between the car's listed weight and actual weight. The mechanic reveals one area he didn't open up - the car's rocker panels underneath the doors. Popeye chews him out and then helps open up these panels, and the stash is found. The car is replaced (either repaired or the department acquires another, intact one), the stash replaced, and it is returned to Devereaux, while the police now wait for the dealers to make their final move.Devereaux meets again with Charnier and is reluctant to do any more favors, until Charnier reveals that Devereaux is now an accomplice - to Devereaux's surprise and horror. Devereaux walks away, but Charnier takes the car himself and drives it to Ward's Island, where Lou Boca directs him to an abandoned factory building. There the heroin stash is revealed and tested positively. The stash is hidden inside the building and cash payment is hidden in the rocker panels of the junker car Lou Boca bought. With the deal completed, the Bocas briefly celebrate and Sal drives Charnier back to the city - and right into a police roadblock led by Popeye. Sal drives back to the factory with police in pursuit, and the mobsters hide inside the main building while Charnier hides in a secondary building. A gunfight ensues, in which Sal Boca is shot dead. Popeye hunts for Charnier inside the dilapidated warehouse. Cloudy joins him as Popeye appears to have cornered Charnier, but as the two cops approach the room Popeye sees someone from another door. He opens fire before Cloudy can corner the now-dead man - who turns out to be Agent Mulderig. Determined to get Frog One at any cost, and not caring that he just killed a Federal agent, Popeye strides through the warehouse, believing the Frenchman is still in hiding. After he rounds a corner a single gunshot is heard.In a montage epilogue, it is revealed that Joel Weinstock was indicted by a Grand Jury, but the case was quickly dismissed for ""lack of proper evidence."" Angie Boca was found guilty of a misdemeanor, but received a suspended prison sentence. Lou Boca was tried and found guilty of conspiracy and possession of narcotics, but received a reduced sentence. Henri Devereaux was tried and found guilty of conspiracy and served four years in a Federal prison. Alain Charnier escaped and is believed to be living in France. Both Doyle and Russo were transferred out of the Narcotics Bureau and re-assigned to other departments in the NYPD.(Note: The French Connection drug bust that inspired the film took place in 1961. However, the film's script sets the action at the time of actual filming, i.e. the winter of 1970-71, in order to avoid the need for period accuracy in the many New York street scenes.)"

Escape from the Planet of the Apes,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067065/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The world is shocked by the appearance of three talking chimpanzees, who arrived mysteriously in a U.S. spacecraft. They become the toast of society, but one man believes them to be a threat to the human race. Following the events in ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"", Cornelius and Zira flee back through time to 20th Century Los Angeles, where they face fear and persecution similar to what Taylor and Brent suffered in the future, and discover the origins of the stream of events that will shape their world.—Marg Baskin <marg@asd.raytheon.ca> Cornelius and Zira, the simian ape couple from the first two ape films, flee from their doomed planet (after the events in Beneath...) in the same spaceship used by Taylor in the first film, and travel back through the same space/time porthole and land on late 20th Century Earth where they are received with fascination and fear from the people they meet.—Michael Zink The third chapter of the Apes saga. Two intelligent simians from the future, Cornelius and Zira, travel to present-day Earth. They become instant sensations, wined and dined and treated like celebrities -- until a high-level plot forces them to run for their lives.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> The preceding film, 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes', ends with a nuclear weapon's destruction of the apes' future Earth itself and everything on it.'Escape from the Planet of the Apes' begins by establishing that three chimpanzee apes, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), Zira (Kim Hunter), and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo) escaped the Earth's destruction by salvaging and repairing the astronaut Taylor's spaceship (which sank in the Dead Lake in the desert Forbidden Zone in the first movie) and piloting it through the nuclear shock wave of Earth's destruction, sending the ship into space and through a time warp wormhole back to present day 1973. The salvage, repair and launch of Taylor's spaceship apparently all happened (off-camera) within the brief period during the final act of the previous film.The three apes arrive on Earth, splashing down on the Pacific coast near Los Angeles. They are found by the surprised local authorities and are transported to a secluded area of the Los Angeles Zoo, under the observation of two scientists, Stephanie Branton (Natalie Trundy) and Lewis Dixon (Bradford Dillman), who administer a series of intelligence tests, which Zira performs unerringly, but she finally loses her patience at the end of the last one and answers Stephanie's question to Lewis with an angry retort. Stephanie and Lewis step outside, completely astonished. Milo argues with Zira and Cornelius about their agreement to hide their ability to speak until they felt the time was right. The argument agitates a wild gorilla on the opposite side of a set of bars in the cages. Milo steps too close to these bars and the wild gorilla reaches through them and strangles Milo to death.Meanwhile, a Presidential Commission has been formed to investigate the return of Taylor's spaceship which was launched the previous year and how the apes, which they already are aware are atypically intelligent, came to be aboard it. Cornelius and Zira are brought before the Presidential Commission, where they publicly reveal their ability to speak, and are welcomed as guests. They tell the commission about their planet in the future which is future Earth, about the apes way of life, but they deny knowing Taylor or anyone else that crash landed on their world.Over the next several weeks, the two apes become celebrities, being lavished with presents and media attention as well as staying in a fancy hotel suite. They come to the attention of the President's Science Advisor Dr. Otto Hasslein (Eric Braeden), who discovers Zira is pregnant and fears for the future of the human race after Zira had earlier told the commission about the growing dominance of apes to be set in the near future. Determined to force the issue, he gets her drunk on champagne (which he assures her is harmless, calling it ""grape juice plus""). The resulting interrogation enables him to convince the Commission that Cornelius and Zira must be subjected to more rigorous questioning.Both chimpanzees are brought to a top secret military base are questioned using various means of interrogation; during this time, one of Hasslein's assistants refers to the apes as ""monkeys"", stirring Cornelius' anger. Hasslein defuses it, saying they simply want to know how apes rose in dominance over men. Under interrogation, Cornelius reveals that according to the historic archive books and sacred scrolls in their ape society of the future, the human race will eventually meet its downfall in the late 20th Century after a plague wiped out all domestic cats and dogs of humans and that humanity adopted apes as household pets which they turned into slaves and that a militant ape, known only as 'Aldo', led a slave revolt and the world was soon dominated by the simians, which will, many years later, lead to the surface of Earth's destruction through nuclear war and anarchy. So many centuries later, in the year 3955, the apes have established a stable and peace full society of semi-primitive nature. However, there are still suspicions about how humans are treated by the future apes when Cornelius and Zira continue to deny knowing Taylor or talk about how humans are treated in their world.Suspicion had already been aroused by Zira letting it slip, during her drunken interrogation by Dr. Hasslein, that she had dissected humans in the course of her scientific work. Hasslein orders Lewis to administer a truth serum to her, while Cornelius is taken to confinement quarters. Lewis warns Zira that the serum will have the same effect as the champagne Hasslein convinced her to drink earlier. As a result of the serum, Hasslein learns for himself that Zira examined and operated on humans in the future and indeed knew Taylor as well as Barnes who also arrived on their planet.Zira is taken to join Cornelius in confinement while the paranoid Hasslein takes his findings to the U.S. President (William Windom) who insists to the President that the apes are a danger to the human race. A little later, an orderly bringing food refers to the unborn child as a ""little monkey""; Cornelius has heard enough of the epithet and knocks the tray out of the orderly's hands and bashes him on the head with the tray, and uses this advantage to escape from the military base. At first, Cornelius thinks that he has only knocked the orderly unconscious, but he is later stunned to overhear that the man died. Hasslein uses the orderly's death and of Cornelius and Zira's escape as an illustration of the future danger the apes present and calls for the apes' execution. The President reluctantly orders that the unborn child's birth be terminated and that both chimpanzees be sterilized or killed.Running for their lives, Cornelius and Zira (assisted by Stephanie and Lewis) find shelter in a circus run by a Mexican national named Señor Armando (Ricardo Montalbán), where an ape named Heloise has just had a baby. There Zira gives birth to a son, whom she names Milo (later known as Caesar).Hasslein, knowing Zira will imminently give birth, orders a search of all circuses and zoos. As a result, Armando must send the apes away. Armando, Lewis and Stephanie provide them with maps and help them plan to hide until such time as they can escape into the Florida Everglades to live the rest of their lives in peace. In case they are discovered, Lewis gives Cornelius a pistol to use as a last resort. Zira asks to say goodbye to Heloise before they leave.Hasslein tracks the apes down to an abandoned ship in Long Beach harbor, and finds Zira resting with her infant. After a short chase through the ship and to the docked ship's stern, Hasslein shoots Zira in cold blood after she refuses to hand over her infant and then proceeds to fire several shots into the infant. Hasslein is immediately shot to death by Cornelius, and falls overboard. After Cornelius kills Hasslein, he is shot by several Marine Corps snipers and, as Stephanie and Lewis watch helplessly from the shore, falls to his death onto the poop deck of the ship. The mortally wounded Zira tosses her dead baby over the side of the ship before crawling to lie with her husband and dying by his side.But in the final scene in a surprising plot twist, Stephanie, Lewis and the other humans are unaware of the real fate of the infant ape. Earlier, Cornelius, Zira, and Armando switched babies with Heloise before their escape from the circus. Armando now watches over the infant Milo as the circus is being moved to a new location. Armando remarks how intelligent that the baby chimp is who will now survive with him at his circus. The final shot shows the baby ape Milo sitting in a cage, plaintively speaking the words ""Mama? Mama?"" with the voice of a human child."
Cold Turkey,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066927/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Hoping for positive publicity, a tobacco company offers $25 million to any American town that quits smoking for 30 days. Amidst a media frenzy, Eagle Rock, Iowa accepts the challenge while the company's PR man tries to sabotage the effort. Reverend Brooks leads the town in a contest to stop smoking for a month, But some tobacco executives don't want them to win, and try everything they can to make them smoke. If townspeople don't go nuts from wanting a cigarette, or kill each other from irritation and frustration, they will win a huge prize.—Brian W Martz <B.Martz@Genie.com> Merwin Wren, the longtime PR head at Valiant Tobacco, comes up with an idea in his desire to have company figurehead Hiram C. Grayson be known in the same vein asAlfred Nobelas opposed to the man who sold 13 trillion cancer causing cigarettes (who remembers that Nobel was a munitions manufacturer, he who used only a small fraction of his wealth to hand out a Peace Prize?): give $25 million to any town in America that will give up smoking for thirty days. After the laughter from the company executives subsides in the ridiculousness of the scheme, Wren convinces them that no town can meet the eligibility criteria of one hundred percent of its citizens signing up, and even in the remote possibility that any one does, that not all one hundred percent would be able to go cold turkey for thirty days, meaning that this PR stunt to raise Grayson to immortality would cost them virtually nothing. By the entry deadline, one town to Wren's amazement meets the sign up criteria: Eagle Rock, Iowa. It is a town with a population 4,006 and declining as one business and industry after another is leaving town and with them its citizens in it being a depressed town. Rev. Clayton Brooks was the one who spearheaded the initiative in his own self-motivated goal of raising the town's fortunes so that he will be reassigned to the town and church of his choice, preferably more prosperous ones. He was able to convince everyone in town, using one tactic or another, to sign up, even the large percentage of die hard smokers, the toughest case being Dr. Proctor, the town's surgeon. Beyond everyone needing to go cold turkey for the thirty days, the contest brings up some systemic problems within the community, both as a collective and individually. In the latter category is Rev. Brooks' own failings as a husband to his repressed wife, Natalie. Conversely, as there is the possibility that Eagle Rock may actually win the $25 million, Wren takes it upon himself to ensure that it doesn't happen.—Huggo"

Disc jockey Dave Garver (Clint Eastwood) attracts the amorous attentions of a demented fan named Evelyn Draper (Jessica Walter). Evelyn lets Dave pick her up at a bar. Later at her apartment, Evelyn admits that she is the cooing caller who repeatedly asks Dave to play the Erroll Garner classic ""Misty"". From then on, this movie is a lesson in how one casual date can turn your whole life around. Evelyn stalks Dave everywhere, ruins his business lunch, assaults his maid, mutilates his house and all of his belongings, and finally threatens to butcher his girlfriend Tobie Williams (Donna Mills). You'll never be able to hear that song again without looking over your shoulder.—alfiehitchie In Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, the popular disc jockey David Garver (Clint Eastwood) has a one night stand with Evelyn Draper (Jessica Walter), a stranger he met in a bar after his show.

Seeing an attractive woman (Jessica Walter) sitting at the end of the bar, Dave and Murphy play a nonsensical board game to get her attention. Her curiosity piqued, the woman comes over and introduces herself as Evelyn Draper. Evelyn laughs when Dave reveals his ploy, and they go to her home, where she confesses that she came to the bar to meet him. Dave then recognizes her voice and realizes that she is the fan who calls him every night with the request ""play 'Misty' for me."" Although Dave warns Evelyn that he is ""hung up"" on another woman, she is unconcerned and spends the night with him, with the stipulation that they will not ""complicate"" each other's lives.The next day, Dave is working at home when Al drops by, but they are interrupted by the appearance of Evelyn, who is carrying groceries. Assuming that Dave had a date with Evelyn, Al leaves, although a nonplussed Dave admonishes her for arriving so unexpectedly. Evelyn is cheered when Dave mentions that she should call ""next time,"" however, and he lets her stay the night.Later, while driving through Carmel, Dave learns that artist Tobie Williams (Donna Mills), his former girl friend who left town four months earlier, has returned. Dave insists on talking with Tobie, and she explains that she could no longer endure waiting for him every night, wondering if he was with another woman. Dave assures her that he has been attempting to change, and states that although her series of eccentric roommates at her isolated Carmel Highlands home irritated him, he wants to resume their relationship. Tobie agrees to consider his proposal but cautions him that she needs time.A little later, Dave is at The Sardine Factory having a drink when Evelyn calls looking for him. Dave signals Murphy to tell her that he is not there, but when Dave leaves, he finds Evelyn waiting in the parking lot having followed him and made the call from a nearby payphone. Again made uneasy by Evelyn's bizarre behavior, Dave refuses to take her out, although in a few days, she again shows up at his house without phoning first. Dave is forced to let her in when she takes off her coat, revealing that she is naked, and once inside, she seduces Dave again. As she leaves the next day, she invites him to her house for dinner, but he replies that he will call her. Dave then goes to work, where he makes a demonstration tape for Madge Brenner (Irene Hervey), an influential radio-station owner who is interested in hiring Dave for a prominent San Francisco job.A few days later, Evelyn calls Dave to chide him for forgetting their date, and an irritated Dave soon arrives, determined to tell her that their relationship is over. Dave becomes infuriated as Evelyn sobs that she loves him, then screams violently at him as he leaves. When Dave returns home, Evelyn calls, begging him to forgive her, but he hangs up on her. Later, Dave spends more time with Tobie, and the increasingly forgiving Tobie makes plans to go to a party with him the following evening.That night, however, an hysterical Evelyn arrives at Dave's, waking him because she believes that Tobie is with him. Surprised to find him alone, Evelyn calms down, but when Dave demands that she leave, Evelyn goes into the bathroom and slashes her wrists. Dave calls a friend, Dr. Frank Dewan (Jack Ging), to tend to Evelyn, who has not been seriously injured, and Frank reluctantly agrees not to notify the police. Evelyn overhears as Frank cautions Dave to keep her calm, and easily manipulates Dave to let her stay by making him feel guilty.The next evening, when Dave attempts to leave to see Tobie, Evelyn pretends to have a nightmare, and Dave is forced to stay with her, thereby standing up Tobie. In the morning, Dave's feisty maid, Birdie (Clarice Taylor), finds him asleep on the couch. Evelyn has taken Dave's car into town to buy groceries, and while she is out, she secretly has a copy of Dave's house key made.Meanwhile, Dave receives a call from Madge, who wants to have lunch with him and discuss the new job. When Evelyn returns to Dave's, he explains that he is on his way to a business luncheon. As Dave and Madge are eating, however, an irate Evelyn arrives and hurls insults at Madge. Dave drags her out of the restaurant into a waiting cab, but when he returns, he finds that Madge has departed.Dave then goes to Tobie's and confesses his situation to her. While Dave is gone, Birdie returns to his house and discovers that Evelyn has destroyed the furnishings and is in the process of cutting up Dave's clothes. Surprised by Birdie's appearance, Evelyn slashes her repeatedly with a knife. Dave arrives as Birdie is being taken away in an ambulance, and the police, led by Sgt. McCallum, are questioning Evelyn. McCallum is irritated by Dave's lack of knowledge about Evelyn, but assures him that she will receive psychiatric help.As time passes, Dave and Tobie reconcile, and months later, attend the Monterey Jazz Festival, where Tobie mentions that a new roommate, Annabel, will be moving in with her. That night, Evelyn calls Dave as he is working, and, explaining that she has been released from the sanatorium, tells him that she is in San Francisco, on her way to Hawaii. She asks him to play ""Misty"" for her, which he does, but later that night, he wakes up to hear the song playing in his bedroom. Dave moves just as Evelyn attempts to stab him with a butcher knife, and she escapes before he can catch her.Shaken, Dave calls McCallum, who reveals that Evelyn had been released pending further legal action. McCallum presses Dave to remember Evelyn's exact words when she called him, especially the line of a poem that she quoted. Dave then warns Tobie that Evelyn has returned, and the next night, although Dave would rather be guarding Tobie, McCallum instructs him to stay at work, so that the police can trace the call if Evelyn telephones him.In order to reassure Dave, McCallum drives to Tobie's house to check on her, and after he leaves, Dave remembers that the poem Evelyn quoted was Edgar Allan Poe's ""Annabel Lee."" Realizing that Evelyn must be Annabel, Tobie's new roommate, Dave puts on a pre-recorded tape of one of his old shows and rushes to her home. By the time Dave arrives, however, Evelyn has murdered McCallum by stabbing him with a pair of scissors and bound and gagged the terrified Tobie, and has cut off some of her hair with the scissors. As Dave attempts to free Tobie, Evelyn jumps out of the darkness and attacks him with a knife, slashing him repeatedly. Although wounded, Dave succeeds in fending her off before she disappears. Dave searches the house for Evelyn, and when she attacks him again, she stabs him several times in his arms and left leg until he finally manages to punch Evelyn in the face with such tremendous force that it knocks Evelyn back through the back glass door and over the balcony railing and over the cliff, sending her falling to her death in the ocean below. As the wounded and bloodied Dave frees Tobie and they stagger from the house together, the pre-recorded tape plays Dave's dedication of ""Misty"" to Evelyn one last time."

Disappointed that Fielding has not followed him into the family business, Dr. Mellish tries to give him confidence by insisting that he take over the operation, but his mother gives him her blessing.In impoverished San Marcos, where each peasant has been ordered to pay the dictator his weight in manure, a captured rebel is tortured by being forced to listen to a recording of Naughty Marietta , which prompts him to confess that the rebels are planning a revolution on July 4th. After Fielding checks into a hotel, he receives an invitation to dine with Vargas at the palace.During the meal, Vargas explains to Fielding that he wants to keep his people safe from Communism by exterminating ""a few troublemakers."" Vargas ignores Fielding's point that the rebels are not Communists and sticks Fielding with the bill. After Fielding leaves, Vargas and his men decide that Fielding is ""perfect"" for their plans. Later, Vargas' men, who are disguised as rebels, try to kill Fielding, intending to blame the death of an American citizen on the revolutionaries in order to win United States support for their regime. Fielding escapes, but is then captured by the real rebels, who take him to their leader, Esposito.At the rebels' camp, Fielding is told that Vargas has already reported his death to the newspapers and will kill him to prevent the truth from getting out. The rebels want him to stay and risk his life for their cause, but Fielding believes that being dead is ""a tremendous drawback"" to one's sex life and prefers to remain cowardly. However, he trains with the rebels and learns about guns, grenades, camouflage and first aid. When the camp is low on food, Fielding is sent to raid the town and, with a few other men, enters a café and orders a couple thousand sandwiches, wheelbarrows of cole slaw and some drinks, then has it delivered.Esposito later sends Fielding and two rebels to kidnap the British ambassador to hold as a hostage until imprisoned sympathizers are freed. While sedating the ambassador with sodium pentothal, Fielding accidentally renders his comrades unconscious. When the ambassador escapes, his revived co-workers flee and Fielding grabs a cross and joins a Catholic procession in order to evade some suspicious soldiers.Meanwhile, mistaking the United Jewish Appeal for the CIA, Vargas makes a pact with them for support, and when the rebels attack, he discovers that the Jewish fundraisers offer little protection. Although the CIA does send men, half the agents are sent to fight for the dictator and the other half to fight against him. His regime defeated, Vargas flees to the safety of Miami.After the rebels' victory, Esposito announces that he is the ruler of San Marcos, and orders that the country's official language will be Swedish and that citizens must now change their underwear every half hour, wearing it outside their clothing so that it can easily be checked. These proclamations and others cause the rebels to realize that power has driven Esposito mad. At the request of his comrades, Fielding takes over as president, but it is soon apparent that San Marcos needs the support of other countries in order to prevent future corrupt dictators from seizing control. The problem, Fielding and his close associates realize, is that Americans think of them as Communists, and Communists believe them to be American puppets. In addition, they have nothing to barter for aid, except bananas. Fielding's advisers urge him to go to the United States and raise money, but he knows that, back home, his reputation as an uneducated product tester has no clout.Disguised in a red beard and mustache, Fielding flies to the United States, where he is officially welcomed as San Marcos' leader. There Fielding's interpreter translates by repeating every English sentence in heavily accented English, until men in white coats with a butterfly net arrive to take him away. During a dinner fundraiser at which he is the speaker, Fielding tries to tell a joke about a farmer who has an incestuous relationship with both his daughters, but decides he is telling it to the wrong crowd. Nancy, who does not recognize him, approaches to express her admiration for the leader and, after they go to bed together, Fielding reveals his true identity, after which Nancy remarks that she now knows why something in their sexual encounter seemed to be missing.Meanwhile, the FBI sees through Fielding's disguise and, based on his record of involvement in riots and protests, assumes that he is trying to subvert the government. On the six o'clock news, newscaster Roger Grimsby reports that Fielding has been charged with being a subversive impostor. At his trial for charges of fraud, inciting a riot, conspiracy to overthrow the government and using the word ""thighs"" in mixed company, Fielding acts as his own lawyer. Both J. Edgar Hoover, who comes to court (disguised as a black woman), and Miss America provide testimony against Fielding. Although an acquaintance describes Fielding as a ""warm, wonderful human being,"" the court reporter types that he is a ""conniving little rat."" While the jury passes around a joint, Fielding, acting as both lawyer and defendant, attempts to cross-examine himself, causing the judge to order him bound and gagged. Fielding is found guilty on twelve counts and sentenced to 15 years, but the time is suspended if he promises not to move into the judge's neighborhood.A free man, Fielding proposes to Nancy, and their wedding night at the Royal Manhattan Hotel is covered by Dunphy and Cosell for Wide World of Sports . From their spectator-filled hotel suite, Cosell provides a play-by-play description of the action. In an interview with Cosell after the consummation of their marriage, Nancy states that Fielding was not the best she has had, but also not the worst, and Fielding predicts that their next ""bout"" will occur in late spring. Cosell wraps up the interview by saying that ""they may live happily ever after and again they may not,"" but promises to be there to cover the action."
The Million Dollar Duck,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066728/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Professor Dooley takes home a duck from his research laboratory as a pet for his son, but soon finds out that it lays golden eggs. To save it from being put to death, Professor Albert Dooley takes home a dumb duck from the research laboratory, which accidentally was exposed to X-rays. At home he discovers that it now lays golden eggs. Since he's broke all the time, his family welcomes this new source of income greatly, and tries to keep it secret. But their greedy neighbors become suspicious.—Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> The film centers on the family of a scientist named Albert Dooley (Dean Jones) who struggles to pay the bills. His wife, Katie (Sandy Duncan) gets a recipe for applesauce wrong and gives it to her husband to take to work for lunch, hoping it will help cut down on the budget. In a humorous chain reaction, the duck Albert is testing steals the applesauce after Albert has thrown it away in the trash, and then wanders into a radiation lab and becomes irradiated. Albert is ordered to get rid of the duck, so he figures he can give it to his son, Jimmy (Lee Montgomery) who has been wanting a pet, only to discover it now lays golden eggs.In a Pavlovian manner, the duck, named ""Charlie"" (despite being female), lays an egg when prompted by the barking of a dog. At first, the only ones who know of Charlie's golden yolks are Albert, Katie, Jimmy and Albert's friend, Fred, but as they sell the yolks of gold, they gain the attention of a suspicious neighbor, a government bureaucrat named Mr. Hooper (Joe Flynn), who starts spying on them (with typical Disney slapstick results such as falling off a tree branch when) his wife gets angry, and ultimately convinces his boss, Rutledge (James Gregory), to get the duck after worldwide phone calls spread the rumor and Rutledge gets a phone call from President Richard Nixon to ""get that duck!"". Albert is overcome by greed and no longer cares for his son, which saddens Jimmy. The FBI soon arrives at the house and orders them to turn over the duck. Jimmy, watching from upstairs, climbs out the window with Charlie, and then rides off with a couple of teenage boys and their hot rod as the FBI try to capture the duck to prevent it from laying gold.In the film's climax, Jimmy is suspended on a ladder between two parking garages, and Albert attempts to convince his son to grab his hand before the ladder falls. Jimmy tells his dad to ""go away"", believing he only wants to save Charlie, but when the ladder begins to break, he grows fearful and grabs his father's hand. They then leave the parking garage, but Albert is promptly arrested by the FBI. The film ends with the family in court, and the judge breaks an egg into a glass after Mr. Hooper barks at the duck to prompt the laying of the egg, which surprisingly turns out to be an ordinary egg yolk, as a result of Mr. Hooper barking at it in the wrong tone. The judge dismisses the charges on account of no proof of a duck laying golden eggs, and Albert tells the family the golden duck was nice while it lasted, but at least they can keep the duck for their pet, now realizing that his family is more important than wealth. The judge then advises Jimmy, ""One word of caution, son. If it ever lays another gold egg, bury it, quick!"" Albert then puts Jimmy on his shoulders and exits the courthouse into a crowd of cheering onlookers."
The Anderson Tapes,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066767/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After ten years in prison to protect a mafia family, Duke Anderson is released and he cashes in a debt of honor with the mob to bankroll a caper. A thief (Duke Anderson) just released from ten years in jail, takes up with his old girlfriend (Ingrid) in her posh apartment. He makes plans to rob the entire building. What he doesn't know is that his every move is recorded on audio and video tape, although he is not the subject of any surveillance.—Zeke M. Towson <matajame@cwis.isu.edu> Convicted safe-cracker Duke Anderson is released after serving ten years in prison. Upon visiting his old girlfriend, Ingrid Everleigh, at her upscale apartment in New York City, Anderson comes up with his next get rich scheme: rob all six apartments in the building. It will be a complex scheme, with numerous ex-con friends and acquaintances part of the plot. Anderson realizes that life has changed in the ten years he has been in prison, where surveillance cameras are now part of everyday life. The cameras are just one more aspect that he has to consider in the scheme. What he doesn't realize is that some of his associates are also under individual electronic surveillance by various organizations, each for a different reason. Some of these taps are legal and some not so legal. Will anyone doing the surveillance work be able to piece together the plot, and even if they do will they care if it does not relate to their prime subject?—Huggo Burglar John ""Duke"" Anderson (Sean Connery) is released after ten years in prison. He renews his relationship with his old girlfriend, Ingrid. She lives in a high-class apartment block (1 East 91st Street) in New York City and Anderson, almost instantly, decides to burgle the entire building in a single sweep - filling a furniture van with the proceeds. He gains financing from a nostalgic Mafia boss and gathers his four-man crew. Also included is an old ex-con drunk, ""Pop"", whom Anderson met in jail, and who is to play concierge while the real one is bound and gagged in the cellar.Less welcome is a man the Mafia foists onto Anderson - the thuggish ""Socks"". Socks is a psychopath who has become a liability to the mob and, as part of the deal, Anderson must kill him in the course of the robbery. Anderson is not keen on this, since the operation is complicated enough, but is forced to go along.Anderson has unwittingly entered a world of pervasive surveillance - the agents, cameras, bugs, and tracking devices of numerous public and private agencies see almost the entire operation from the earliest planning to the execution. As Anderson advances the scheme, he moves from the surveillance of one group to another as locations or individuals change. These include a private detective hired to eavesdrop on Anderson's girlfriend who is also the mistress of a wealthy man; the BNDD, who are checking over a released drug dealer; the FBI, investigating Black activists and the interstate smuggling of antiques; and the IRS, which is after the mob boss who is financing the operation. Yet, because the various federal, state and city agencies performing the surveillance are all after different goals, none of them is able to ""connect the dots"" and anticipate the robbery.The operation proceeds over a Labor Day weekend. Disguised as a Mayflower moving and storage crew, the crooks cut telephone and alarm wires and move up through the building, gathering the residents as they go and robbing each apartment.
(The scenes of the residents being seized, and in some cases assaulted, are shown in contrast to them giving statements to the police after the robbery, which appears to indicate that it succeeded.)However, the son of two of the residents is a paraplegic and asthmatic who is left behind in his air-conditioned room. Using his amateur radio equipment, he calls up other radio amateurs, based in Hawaii, Portland, Maine and Wichita Falls, who contact the police. The alarm is thus raised, after some problems as to which side (callers or emergency services) should take the phone bill.
As the oblivious criminals work, the police array enormous forces outside to prevent their escape and send a team in via a neighboring rooftop.In the shootout that follows, Anderson kills Socks, but is himself shot by the police. The other robbers are killed, injured or captured, but none gets away with it. Pop gives himself up after letting the police believe that he is the real concierge for a while. Having never adapted to life on the outside, he looks forward to going back to prison.
In the course of searching the building, the police discover some audio listening equipment left behind by the private detective who was hired to check up on Ingrid. While organizing the robbery, Anderson met various people who were under similar surveillance for other reasons by various government agencies. To avoid embarrassment over the failing to realize what was going on and that some of the recordings were illegal, the agencies order the tapes to be erased."

Convinced by their fanatic leader, former news broadcaster Matthias (Anthony Zerbe), that Neville personifies the twin evils of science and militarism. Neville remains safely barricaded in his elegant, downtown penthouse apartment, where he has hoarded food, liquor and fuel normalcy in spite of the catastrophe around him, Neville patrols the city by day, carrying a machine gun and recording any sign of the mutants' activity in hopes of finding and destroying them. After another evening of fighting off attacks led by Matthias and his cohort Zachary, Neville searches downtown in hope of tracking them down. Attempting to suppress his constant anxiety, Neville ""shops"" in a clothing store and is startled when he sees a young black woman attempting to blend in with the store mannequins. Neville chases the woman, but she escapes by running into a park. Exhausted, Neville trudges into a bar and hearing a noise, descends into the darkened wine cellar where he is attacked by a group of mutants who take him to Matthias. Matthias condemns Neville for not being one of his ""family"" because he is not infected and declares him ""obsolete"". Neville maintains that the mutants should organize and attempt to find a cure, but Matthias and the others declare Neville guilty and carry him outside to a cart where he is driven to an area just outside of the stadium. Lashing Neville to a tree, Matthias exhorts his followers to burn the scientist as the bodies of the the dead were burned after initial contamination. Suddenly the stadium lights come one, forcing the mutants to collapse in an effort to cover their sensitive eyes and skin.

The woman forces Neville at gunpoint to drive her on a motorbike through the stadium and away from the recovering mutants.At dawn, the couple arrives at a house at the base of the mountains where Neville is stunned to meet a few healthy children. The young man joins the group and introduces himself as Dutch and the woman as Lisa. Dutch tells Neville that he is familiar with his work, as he was a graduate student in biochemistry before the disaster. Dutch explains that neither he nor Lisa and the children understand why they have not been afflicted with the plague, but admits that most of them have a mild sensitivity to light. Lisa and Dutch then tell Neville that they have brought him to examine one of the young people, Richie, who has shown signs of plague. After examining the boy, Neville shocks Lisa and Dutch when he reveals that he is immune to the plague due to a vaccination he developed and took just as the war reached its peak. Heartened when Neville suggests that his blood could be used to make a serum, Dutch and Lisa agrees to let Neville take Richie back to town where Neville has access to laboratories. At Neville's penthouse, he administers the last remaining vaccination to Richie.

When Neville tells Richie about the serum, the boy expresses happiness that everyone will soon ""return to normal"".

Set in winter in the Old West. Charismatic but dumb John McCabe arrives in a young Pacific Northwest town to set up a whorehouse/tavern. The shrewd Mrs. Miller, a professional madam, arrives soon after construction begins. She offers to use her experience to help McCabe run his business, while sharing in the profits. The whorehouse thrives and McCabe and Mrs. Miller draw closer, despite their conflicting intelligences and philosophies.

John McCabe, who largely lives off what he is able to win in gambling, has just rode into the relatively new mining town of Presbyterian Church, nestled in the mountains of Washington. He is an intimidating figure to most of the men in town, in large part because of his quiet bravado and the belief they have that he is a gunslinger who recently killed a man. With his money, McCabe opens up some businesses catering to the men in town, including a whorehouse and bathhouse, the former which he sets up with a trio of cheap hookers he purchased from nearby Bear Paw. Shortly thereafter, cockney Brit Constance Miller also arrives into town, she, a whore herself, who makes a proposition to McCabe that she run the whorehouse and bathhouse to her exacting high standards on a fifty/fifty partnership basis with him, a proposition which McCabe eventually accepts. Mrs. Miller is able to make a successful go at the businesses despite her penchant for opium, of which McCabe is unaware. The businesses are so successful that the Harrison Shaughnessy mining company sends two of its representatives to Presbyterian Church to buy all McCabe's holdings in town. McCabe turns them down before he learns from much more streetwise Mrs. Miller that there is a steeper price to pay for going against Harrison Shaughnessy. As such, McCabe may have to use those gunslinging skills he purportedly possesses not only to save his and Mrs. Miller's businesses, but his life as well.—Huggo In the early 1900s, John McCabe - poker player and reputed gunfighter - arrives in a small mining and lumber town in the Pacific Northwest and decides to open a saloon and bordello.

Silent as a painting, the movie shows us day-dreamer Hermie and his friends Oscy and Benjie spending the summer of '42 on an US island with their parents - rather unaffected by WWII. While Oscy's main worries are the when and how of getting laid, Hermie honestly falls in love with the older Dorothy, who's married to an army pilot. When her husband returns to the front, Hermie shyly approaches her.—Bob Dawson <dawsonb@lfs.loral.com> Hermie, in middle age, reflects on the summer of 1942 when he was fifteen, the Americans had recently entered fighting in World War II, and he himself was just entering puberty where thoughts of girls were top on his and his friends' minds. He and his two best friends, Oscy and Benjie, and their respective families, spent the summer on an island off the coast of New England, Hermie the sensitive one, Oscy the forward one, and Benjie the meek scared one still closer to being a child than an adult. Although Hermie and Oscy attempted to get as far as second base with girls their own age, they didn't really comprehend the full act of sex, let alone protected sex, only reading about intercourse and seeing the pictures in Benjie's parents' medical book. As they contemplated perhaps trying to go all the way with girls their own age, Hermie could not stop thinking about the young war bride on the island, Dorothy, her husband who was just shipped overseas into combat. Hermie, who did whatever he could to spend time with Dorothy, had no expectations of her in that manner, as he wanted their friendship to be grown-up yet classy and as she only saw him as a nice young man who sometimes helped her with chores she couldn't manage on her own. But an event that happened in her life would change the nature of their friendship, if only for a brief moment in time, out of emotional necessity.—Huggo TeenageHerman Raucher, summering on Nantucket Island with his sex-obsessed pals Oscy and Benji during World War II, meets Dorothy, a newlywed in her 20s whose husband is off at war.

Hermie falls in love with the married Dorothy, whose husband is an army pilot recently sent to the battlefront of World War II.—yusufpiskin The film opens with a series of still photographs appearing over melancholic music, representing the abstract memories of the unseen Herman Raucher, now a middle-aged man. We then hear Raucher (voiced by Robert Mulligan) recalling the summer he spent on the island of Nantucket in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then 15-year-old Herman ""Hermie"" Raucher (Gary Grimes) and his friends jock Oscy (Jerry Houser) and introverted nerd Benjie (Oliver Conant) spent playing on the beach. They are the self-proclaimed 'Terrible Trio'. They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride (Jennifer O'Neill) into a house on the beach and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her out of his mind.They continue spending afternoons on the beach where, in the midst of scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie finds her trying to carry bags of groceries by herself, and helps get them back to her house. They strike up a friendship and he agrees to return to help her with chores.Meanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, thanks to a sex manual discovered by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this by going to the cinema and picking-up a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam (Christopher Norris), ""giving"" Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie (Katherine Allentuck) and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night.Hermie and Oscy spend the entirety of the evening's film attempting to ""put the moves"" on Miriam and Aggie. Oscy pursues Miriam, eventually making out with her during the movie, and later learns her ways are well-known on the island. Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.The next morning, Hermie helps the bride move boxes into her attic and she thanks him by giving him a kiss on the forehead. Later, in preparation for a marshmallow roast on the beach with Aggie and Miriam, Hermie goes to the local drugstore. In a painfully humorous sequence he builds up the nerve to ask for condoms.That night, Hermie roasts marshmallows at the beach with Aggie while Oscy succeeds in having sex with Miriam between the dunes. He is so successful he sneaks over to Hermie and Aggie to ask for more condoms. Confused as to what's happening, Aggie follows Oscy back, where she sees him having sex with Miriam and runs home, upset.The next day, Hermie comes across the bride sitting outside her house, writing to her husband. Hermie offers to keep her company that night and she says she looks forward to seeing him, revealing her name is Dorothy. She finally tells Hermie a little about herself; she is 22-years-old, and has been married to her husband for just under a year until he was recently drafted and has been sent to England in the US Army Air Corps. An elated Hermie goes home and puts on a suit, dress shirt and heads back to Dorothy's house, running into Oscy on the way; Oscy relates that Miriam's appendix burst and she's been rushed to the mainland. Hermie, convinced he is at the brink of adulthood because of his relationship with Dorothy, brushes Oscy off.He heads to her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers a bottle of whiskey, several cigarette butts in an ashtray, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead; his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her ""I'm sorry."" The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him.Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say ""Good night, Hermie."" He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.At dawn, Hermie meets Oscy and the two share a moment of reconciliation, with Oscy informing Hermie that Miriam will recover. Oscy, in an uncharacteristic act of sensitivity, lets Hermie be by himself, departing with the words, ""Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass.""Trying to sort out what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island in the middle of the night and an envelope is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it.

A Clockwork Orange,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the future, a sadistic gang leader is imprisoned and volunteers for a conduct-aversion experiment, but it doesn't go as planned. Protagonist Alex DeLarge is an ""ultraviolent"" youth in futuristic Britain. As with all luck, his eventually runs out and he's arrested and convicted of murder. While in prison, Alex learns of an experimental program in which convicts are programmed to detest violence. If he goes through the program, his sentence will be reduced and he will be back on the streets sooner than expected. But Alex's ordeals are far from over once he hits the streets of Britain..—Nikki Carlyle In a near-futuristic society, late teen Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of thugs - his ""droogs"" - who commit acts of ultra-violence, often with sexual components, without any regard for their victims, and purely because it strikes their collective fancies. These acts are largely fueled by drug use. In addition, Alex is a lover of music, especially that ofLudwig van Beethoven, which, when he listens to it during these acts, intensifies his pleasure, and in turn inspires him to commit further such acts. He does not tolerate any challenge to his leadership by his droogs. Although the authorities in general know of Alex's delinquency, they have so far been unable to catch him in the act of his crimes, until one night after a sexual assault of an older woman. Alex, and Alex alone is charged, convicted and incarcerated. But Alex sees what he believes is an easy way out when the government looks for subjects to participate in a new rehabilitation therapy, the end result being release from prison after the two week therapy. The therapy ends up having consequences that Alex did not envision. The questions become how Alex will function, and how others will act toward him in his changed state.—Huggo In the future, the violent and psychopath delinquent Alex, leader of a gang of ultra-violent criminal teenagers who kill, steal and rape, falls into the hands of the police. Arrested, he receives the option to participate in a program developed by the government that can reduce his time in jail. Alex turns guinea pig for experiments intended to curb the destructive impulses of men and solve the society's crime problems, but ends up becoming powerless to deal with the violence that surrounds him.—MadMovieManiac Sentenced to fourteen years in prison after an unrestrained life of sex, violence, and murder in the mean streets of futuristic Britain, theLudwig van Beethoven-lover and leader of an anarchic quartet of thugs, Alex DeLarge, is about to get a dose of his own medicine. As a result, after two long years in jail, the once-swaggering juvenile delinquent gets the chance to earn his freedom, by taking part in the government's experimental de-conditioning program that promises to flush one's harmful anti-social tendencies out of his mind. However, sometimes, the cure is worse than the disease. Will the new and improved Alex fit in the world he had a hand in creating?—Nick Riganas ""A bit of the old ultra-violence.""The story takes place in London in a dystopian future. ""Our humble narrator"" Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) and his droogs, Georgie (James Marcus), Dim (Warren Clarke), and Pete (Michael Tarn), are seated in the Korova Milk Bar stoned on milk laced with narcotics.Shortly, the gang leaves the Korova for a night of ultra-violence. They encounter a wino (Paul Farrell) in an underpass, and beat him with their truncheons. Later, they arrive at a derelict theater. On the stage, another gang, led by a rival named Billy Boy, prepare to rape a voluptuous girl. Instead, the two gangs battle it out-- Alex and his two droogs are victorious.The trio next head out into the dark countryside looking for action. Alex pilots their stolen Durango 95 sports car. After playing ""hogs of the road,"" wherein they drive on the wrong side of the road and run a number of other motorists off into ditches and over embankments, Alex suggests making a ""surprise visit."" They stop at a lonely country house that displays a backlighted sign that simply reads ""Home."" Alex tricks his way into the house by claiming to be the victim of a car accident. They beat the homeowner, a writer named Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang rape his wife (Adrienne Corri) while Alex croons ""Singin' in the Rain.""When they've finished having fun, the gang returns to the Korova. An opera singer seated at an adjacent table sings the chorus from Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Listening to the woman, Alex is ecstatic -- ""I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise""-- but Dim ruins the mood when he makes a farting noise. Alex hits him in the crotch with his truncheon. Henceforth, Dim is resentful but Alex dismisses him.Alex arrives at his apartment just before dawn. Climbing into bed, he fantasizes scenes of violence while listening to Beethoven's 9th Symphony.In the morning, Alex's mother (Sheila Raynor) tries to wake Alex for school, but he feigns illness. At the breakfast table she discusses the situation with his father (Philip Stone). Alex's parents seem foolish and impotent. When Alex later awakens and wanders about the apartment in his underwear he encounters his probation officer, Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris), in his parent's bedroom. The officer lectures Alex about his school truancy and threatens him with jail.After Deltoid leaves, Alex begins another busy day. He picks up two girls at a local shopping mall record store and brings them home. In a sped-up sequence backed by the ""William Tell Overture,"" he has sex with both of them.Later that day, he encounters his droogs in his apartment house lobby. They ominously tell him that they've been ""talking."" They feel that Alex has been bullying them, especially Dim, and they suggest that Alex has been taking more than his fair share of the spoils from their robberies. Georgie proposes an idea to make lots more money. He wants to rob a rich lady who owns a health farm in the country. Alex perceives Georgie's independent thinking as a threat, but wanting to appear democratic, he goes along with it. As the three droogs walk along a river bank outside the apartment block, Alex attacks. He throws first Georgie and then Dim into the fountain. When Alex offers to help pull Dim out of the water, he slashes the back of Dim's outstretched hand with a hidden dagger. They all retire to the Duke of York, a restaurant. Having re-established his dominance of the group, Alex reconsiders Georgie's idea.Arriving at the health farm that evening, the droogs try the same trick they'd used at Alexander's house previously: pretending that one of them has been injured in a traffic accident. However, the proprietress (Miriam Karlin) is suspicious and calls the police, telling them that she'd heard the news reports about the writer and his wife being victimized in the same manner. When the boys aren't let into the house, Alex climbs up a drainpipe, enters a second floor window, and confronts the homeowner. They fight, the woman defending herself with a bust of Beethoven, until Alex bludgeons her with a huge plastic phallus sculpture. As police sirens are heard in the distance, Alex runs out the front door. It is there and then that his droogs take their revenge. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a milk bottle and the droogs flee. As Alex writhes and screams on the ground, the police arrive.Alex is arrested. At the police station, an uncooperative and belligerent Alex is questioned by several constables. When an overzealous beat constable presses his thumb against Alex's broken nose, Alex kicks the officer in the groin. The other officers then beat Alex until Deltoid shows up. Deltoid tells Alex that unfortunately for him, the proprietress of the health farm has died, making Alex a murderer. He spits in Alex's face and tells him how disappointed he is. Alex laughs it off, but is soon headed for prison.PrisonAlex gets sentenced to fourteen years in prison. He deposits his possessions with Chief Officer Barnes (Michael Bates), undresses, and undergoes a cavity search. After answering several questions about his health and personal well-being, Alex is given prison garb. He's now prisoner number 655321.Two years later, Alex is shown scheming to get favors by feigning piety. He helps the prison chaplain (Godfrey Quigley) with his service and he studies the Bible. But rather than reflecting on the redemptive power of the Lord, Alex visualizes himself torturing Jesus at the crucifixion, killing people in battle, and laying about with concubines in an Old Testament setting.Alex tells the chaplain that he's heard of a new treatment, the so-called ""Ludovico Technique,"" that helps criminals get out of prison. The chaplain says that it's experimental and that he's not sure it's right for Alex. But Alex, eager to finagle a short-cut to freedom, vies to be selected for the experiment. When the government's Interior Minister (Anthony Sharp) visits the prison, Alex makes a show of himself. The minister picks Alex as a perfect Ludovico subject. Alex is taken before the prison governor (Michael Gover) who tells the boy that, although he'd rather punish him, the political party currently in power have ""new, ridiculous ideas"" about criminal reform, so Alex will shortly be released.The Ludovico TechniqueChief Officer Barnes then transports Alex to the Ludovico Centre. Alex is given a room and is interviewed by Dr. Branom (Madge Ryan). She promises him that he'll be fine, then gives him an injection.In his first day of treatment Alex appears in an auditorium in a straight jacket. His head is strapped to the back of a restraining chair so that he can neither turn his head nor look away. An eye doctor installs clamps on his eyelids that forcibly keep Alex's eyes open. Then, while the doctor constantly drops eye wash into Alex's grotesquely clamped eyes, Alex is subjected to two violent films. The first shows explicit scenes of a severe beating, the second, a gang rape. Halfway through the first film Alex begins to feel sick. By the end of the second, Alex is shouting for something into which to vomit. At the rear of the auditorium, Dr. Brodsky (Carl Duering) explains to observers that the drug administered to Alex causes a form of paralysis with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. Following the screening, Dr. Branom assures Alex that his feeling of sickness is a sign that he's getting better.On the following day Alex is back in the auditorium, this time for two shows: morning and afternoon. While viewing scenes of Nazis during World War II, Alex begins screaming in earnest. The background music is none other than Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Alex screams that he shouldn't be made to feel sick while listening to such beautiful music. Brodsky loudly apologizes, saying that it can't be helped while quietly he speculates to nearby staff that perhaps this is the ""punishment element.""Two weeks later, presumably after twelve more treatments, Alex is paraded before a group of dignitaries by the Interior Minister. Alex is there for demonstration purposes. He is first confronted by an angry Irishman (John Clive) who throws him to the ground and forces Alex to lick his boot. Next he's approached by a statuesque platinum blonde (Virginia Wetherell) clad only in panties. Alex collapses in a fit of nausea when he tries to touch her breasts. The Interior Minister proclaims a new era in law enforcement and social justice, but the prison chaplain exclaims that the procedure has debased Alex's human nature by taking away his ability to choose good over evil. The Interior Minister counter claims that the only thing that matters is results.Welcome HomeAlex returns home to find his parents plus a stranger (Clive Francis) sitting in the living room reading newspaper accounts of his release. Alex tries to make awkward small talk. When he hints about moving back home, his father tells him that Joe, their new lodger, has already paid the next month's rent. Alex is upset but Joe, who has ingratiated himself with Alex's parents, pushes the situation by castigating Alex for the things he did before going to prison and for breaking his parents' hearts. Before Alex can hit Joe, his psychological conditioning kicks in, leaving him dry heaving, to the dismay and disgust of Joe and Alex's parents. When he has recovered, Alex storms out.Alex later stares at the Thames river below a bridge, presumably contemplating suicide. He's approached by a bum seeking spare change. Alex fishes some cash from his pocket and hands it over. Taking a closer look, the bum recognizes Alex as the same malchick who beat him under the bridge two years earlier. Alex looks at the bum in horror and tries to escape, but is trapped in the very same underpass by the bum and his elderly compatriots. They hit and kick Alex as he cowers on the ground, disabled by his conditioning. Two constables show up to break up the fight. To Alex's further horror, his rescuers turn out to be Dim and Georgie, his former droogs, who are now constables. Demonstrating that police training hasn't altered their basic violent natures, they handcuff Alex, drive him out of town. Out in the woods, Dim pushes Alex' head into a cattle trough filled with filthy water, and Georgie beats him with his baton. They then remove the cuffs and leave him battered and gasping. With thoughts of home echoing in his head, Alex staggers to the first house he can find. It displays a welcoming, backlighted sign that reads ""Home.""At home, Frank Alexander sits at his typewriter, now in the wheelchair that he's used ever since he was severely beaten two years earlier. Julian (David Prowse), his muscular attendant, answers the doorbell. As Julian opens the door, Alex collapses into the entryway. Julian carries him into the house.When confronted by a concerned Mr. Alexander, Alex realizes he's at the very same residence in which, two years earlier, he and his former partners in crime gang-raped Alexander's wife. He relaxes, however, when he realizes that Mr. Alexander couldn't possibly recognize him due to the fact that Alex and his droogies wore masks back in those days. Mr. Alexander, who knows Alex only as the subject of the Ludovico treatment, invites the lad to have a bath and some supper.As Alex soaks in the bath, Mr. Alexander calls a friend with whom he discusses the political repercussions of Alex's Ludovico conditioning. He believes that the government has a totalitarian agenda, as exemplified by its willingness to rob its citizens of their free will. As he finishes the conversation, Alexander arranges a visit with the person on the other end, stating, ""He'll be here,"" before he hangs up the phone.Mr. Alexander sits in his wheelchair relishing a fantasy of using Alex as a political pawn when he becomes aware of singing coming from the bathroom. In his bath, Alex has struck up a bright rendition of ""Singin' in the Rain."" Mr. Alexander's face twists in agony and rage as he thinks back to the night of the home invasion that left him crippled and realizes just who Alex is.Later, at the dinner table, an obviously distraught Mr. Alexander encourages Alex to eat and drink. Flanked by the apoplectic Mr. Alexander and the burly Julian, Alex eats a plate of spaghetti while Mr. Alexander plies Alex with red wine. As he eats, Alex grows increasingly fearful, wondering if the hostile-looking old man knows his real identity. Suddenly Mr. Alexander brings up the subject of his wife's rape and subsequent death. He believes that, though she officially died of pneumonia, it was her broken spirit that killed her. She was, according to Mr. Alexander, a victim of the modern age, just as Alex is a victim of the modern age. He tells Alex that two friends are expected and that they will help the boy.A minute later, man named Dolin (John Savident) and a woman (Margaret Tyzack) enter. They question Alex about the Ludovico treatment and whether it is true that, in addition to conditioning him against sex and violence, it has also made him incapable of listening to music. Alex replies that he only feels a foreboding sense of extreme depression when he hears Beethoven's Ninth Symphony specifically-- at which point he passes out, face down, into the plate of spaghetti. He has been drugged by the wine. Dolin congratulates Mr. Alexander who then asks Julian to bring the car around to the front. The conspirators have plans for Alex that will embarrass the government.Alex awakens the next morning in a small, second floor bedroom in an unknown country house. The room is flooded with the strains of Beethoven's 9th Symphony blasted from a stereo in the room below. As Mr. Alexander beams with satisfaction, Alex is driven to suicide. He leaps from the second floor window to the stone patio below.CuredSome time later, Alex wakes up in a hospital in a full-body cast, having survived his suicide attempt. Newspaper clippings reveal that the government is being vilified for inhuman experimentation. The Interior Minister is being subjected to especially fierce attack. Alex's parents visit, apologizing for not taking him back and promising him his old room when he is released from the hospital.Next, Alex is visited by Doctor Taylor (Pauline Taylor), a psychiatrist. He tells her he had strange dreams of other scientists messing around in his head. She says she's unable to interpret his dreams and then cheerfully shows Alex a series of cartoons having sexual or violent connotations. Alex is to supply the captions. He pleases Dr. Taylor by indicating through his descriptions of the cartoons that sex and violence are the foremost interests on his mind.Once the Ludovico Treatment has been successfully reversed, the Interior Minister visits Alex. As the aristocratic Minister spoon-feeds dinner to the juvenile thug, he assures Alex that he wants to be his friend. With oily smoothness the Minister apologizes for what his government has done. He promises Alex a good job on a good salary, provided that Alex helps the government. He assures the lad that the subversive writer, Frank Alexander, who had threatened him, has been put away. Alex milks the meeting for all it's worth.As a symbol of their understanding, the Minister calls for his assistants. They sweep in with flowers and a massive stereo system blasting Beethoven's 9th Symphony, followed by a troop of reporters and photographers. Alex poses with his new friend, the Interior Minister, aka ""Fred,"" as cameras flash and Beethoven's 9th Symphony reaches its choral climax. Alex's eyes roll back into his head as he fantasizes about an orgy in the snow with a gorgeous blonde, to the applause of Victorian ladies and gentlemen.Alex is heard in voiceover: ""I was cured, all right."""

Red Sun,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067770/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1870, a gang robs a train and steals a ceremonial Japanese sword meant as a gift for the U.S. President, prompting a manhunt to retrieve it. The Japanese ambassador is traveling through the Wild West by train, when gangsters hold up the train, to rob a gold shipment. They also carry an ancient Japanese sword the ambassador was carrying as a present for the US president. The ambassador's bodyguard (Toshiro Mifune) will go after them, with the aid of one of the gang's leaders betrayed by his pals...—Artemis-9 It's 1870 in the American west. Outlaw Link Stuart and his bandits, which includes a suave Frenchman nicknamed Gauche, proceed to rob a train, taking the valuables from the passengers and looting the cargo. One of the passengers is the Japanese ambassador traveling to Washington to meet PresidentUlysses S. Grant, the Ambassador and his security detail of two samurai who are in their own private car. As such, one of the unexpected treasures the bandits is able to obtain is a ceremonial Japanese sword which was meant as a gift from the Japanese government to the President. But in the bandits' getaway, Link is double crossed by Gauche, who mistakenly assumes Link is killed in the ensuing melee. So Gauche now becomes the common enemy for both Link and the Ambassador, who is able to convince a reluctant Link to allow one of his samurai, Kuroda Jubie, to accompany him to locate Gauche and the loot. Although Gauche is a common enemy, the missions for Link and Kuroda are somewhat incompatible, as Link knows the samurai solely wants to kill Gauche to retrieve the sword, while Link has to get the information of the location of the loot from Gauche before he is killed. Also Link and Kuroda are working on different motives and different sensibilities, Link's motive which is largely monetary, while Kuroda's is solely honor, not being able to retrieve the sword which would mean dishonor and needing to go through the ritual of harakiri for eternal redemption. Although Kuroda is more than capable of taking care of himself, perhaps even more so than Link, he is still a fish out of water, and requires Link's knowledge of Gauche and the region to find him. Part of that knowledge is Cristina, Gauche's prostitute girlfriend who they may need to turn to find him. Beyond finding Gauche and trying to overcome their own differences, Link and Kuroda may have other natural obstacles of the region, namely other enemies not yet in the picture such as other bandits or marauding Comanches.—Huggo The story takes place in Arizona, around 1870. Link and Gotch are two ruthless robbers that attack along with their men at the train which carries the ambassador of Japan over to Washington. During the robbery, Gotch takes a very valuable gold sword, which is a gift from the emperor to the president of the U.S. and tries to kill Link, so that he can take all the money for himself. Now Kuroda (the only survivor of the samurais that escorted the ambassador) and Link must leave their differences aside and work together. They both want to find Gotch, but for different reasons: Kuroda wants to take back the sword, and Link wants the stolen money. All this must be done in seven days, or the samurai will kill Link and himself.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com>"
$,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068152/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bank security expert plots with a call girl to rob three safety deposit boxes containing $1.5 million in cash belonging to three very different criminals from a high-tech security bank in Hamburg, Germany. Several criminals use safe deposit boxes in a German bank to store large amounts of illicit cash. An employee of the bank learns who they are by means of a prostitute they all patronize, and devises a clever plan with her to steal the money. Now the criminals can't go to the police, but they can try to steal the money back...—Anonymous Caper film about crooks robbing crooks, set in Germany where an American bank security Joe Collins expert plots with a call-girl Dawn Divine to rob three safety deposit boxes from three criminals; a local drug dealer known as the Candy Man; a Las Vegas mobster; and a crooked U.S. Army sergeant. The heist goes off with little complications. But when Candy Man and the Sarge find their money gone and figure out that Dawn (whom they all have gotten to know) is behind it, they team up to try to get their money back.—Matt Patay In Hamburg, West Germany, American security consultant Joe Collins (Warren Beatty) is considered by bank manager Kessel (Gert Frobe) to be the most honest, hard-working bank security expert in the world. Unknown to Kessel, Joe has been devising a plan with his girl friend, American expatriate prostitute Dawn Divine (Goldie Hawn), to take the contents from bank safe-deposit boxes owned by several criminals and place them into one owned by Dawn.As Joe explains to Dawn, the theft will be beyond the law because the thefts of illegal funds can never be reported. Joe's plan depends upon his intellect and knowledge of the bank's expensive vault, coupled with information that Dawn supplies to him about some of her clients: Sarge (Scott Brady), an American sergeant who is involved in the black market, and has recently graduated to smuggling heroin; an attorney known only by his nickname Mr. Las Vegas, (Robert Webber) who is helping his Las Vegas clients evade taxes; and Candy Man (Arthur Brauss), a sadistic killer and drug dealer.Although Joe has arranged for his friend Helga (Christiane Maybach), a striptease dancer at a gangster-run nightclub, to report on Candy Man, she is killed, apparently after arranging for Dawn to meet Candy Man and accompany him on a flight to Copenhagen. Unknown to Dawn, Candy Man is to deliver some concentrated LSD that he has poured into an empty champagne bottle.On the flight, he gives Dawn the champagne to carry in her bag, telling her to save it for later. Upon their arrival in Copenhagen, though, she is stopped by customs officials, who say that they were given a tip (from Joe) that she might be smuggling drugs into the country. While they are questioning her, Candy Man surreptitiously takes the champagne and walks away. When Dawn is let go by the authorities, she returns to Hamburg, to the relief of Joe, who did not find out about Helga's death until after it was too late to stop Dawn.On the day of the heist, which Joe had already announced was his last before returning home, Joe sets his plan in motion by telling some of the bank employees to watch out for a suspicious-looking man with a scar. At the specified time, a nervous Dawn, who has been practicing her lines all morning, calls and whispers a threat to blow up the bank if Kessel does not give a man with a scar the gold bar on display in a secure case in the lobby. A nervous Kessel alerts Joe, who goes with him to retrieve the gold bar, then quickly grabs it and runs into the vault as he orders the clerk to shut the vault door immediately. Kessel and the others at the bank are amazed by Joe's bravery but worried when they realize that he had left the key to open the vault from the inside on his desk. Kessel communicates with Joe through the bank's video security system and assures him that the police are on their way and will look for the bomb. He also insists, over Joe's assurances that he will be fine and Kessel should not ruin a $50,000 door, on using a blowtorch to break the vault's lock because he fears that the air will not last until the next morning when it would automatically open.After the police determine that there was no bomb, scores of spectators and media arrive at the bank. While his plight is being reported extensively on local German television, Joe quickly unlocks and empties the targeted safe-deposit boxes, placing the content of each into Dawn's box and timing his activities to avoid the security camera's sweeping lens. Meanwhile, thousands of people throughout Germany are watching television and hailing Joe for his bravery, even Sarge and Mr. Las Vegas. When the welder finally breaks through the vault door, Joe has completed his job and the safe-deposit boxes appear to be untouched.The next day, when Sarge comes to empty his safe-deposit box, he sees Joe and congratulates him for his ""American know how"" and bravery. As Sarge and Candy Man go into private rooms to open their respective safe-deposit boxes, they are stunned to find them empty, as is Mr. Las Vegas, who collapses in shock.Meanwhile, Dawn, who has entered the bank and taken the contents of her safe-deposit box, now bursting with cash and Candy Man's champagne bottle, is barely able to leave the bank without the assistance of an eager Kessel, who finds her attractive.As the day goes on, Candy Man is threatened and savagely beaten up by his drug contacts for not having their money, and Sarge, believing that his partner, the Major (Robert Stiles), has robbed him starts to beat him up until Candy Man arrives and tells them that only the people who could not report their theft had been robbed. As they ponder what has happened, Candy Man sees a photograph of Sarge and Dawn, then takes Sarge and Major to her apartment. Although Sarge thinks that Dawn is ""a dumb broad,"" incapable of being involved in the robbery, they find Joe's name and telephone number in her address book, then call him and quickly hang up. Candy Man, who says he does not believe in coincidences or heroes, waits while Sarge calls Kessel to ask for Joe's home address, saying that he is a friend who lost his address. Kessel is at first reluctant to reveal the information but relents when Sarge says that he needs it for a party, which Kessel assumes is Joe's going away party. Kessel then has second thoughts and calls Joe to inform him what he has done. Joe tells him that it is not a problem, then quickly packs up all of the cash that he and Dawn have been counting. Dawn adds the champagne bottle to the suitcase (unaware about the contents) she will take, then, on Joe's instructions, drives away in his car just as Sarge, the major and Candy Man arrive.While the Major follows Dawn, Sarge and Candy Man pursue Joe into his building, then through the backstreets and rail yards of Hamburg. Meanwhile, Dawn eludes Major by boarding a train that is about to leave, then jumping off as it pulls out of the station.Sarge and the Candy Man continue to chase Joe through the city and the underground Elbe Tunnel before Joe makes his escape from Hamburg by hiding in a car being transported on a car hauling trailer. Candy Man writes down the truck's license plate number and makes a call to the destination of the truck.Early the next morning, Sarge and Candy Man see the trailer out in the country and moments later spy Joe walking through the snow. They jump into Sarge's car and follow the road around a frozen lake, and when the car gets stuck in some slush, Candy Man jumps into another car and drives out onto the lake. As Candy Man drives back and forth trying to run down Joe, the ice begins to crack and the car sinks, sending him plunging to his death in the icy water.Now Joe starts to run toward a moving train as Sarge gets into his car and follows. Some time later, as Joe is sleeping in a compartment on the train, Sarge (having stopped the train with a road flare on the train tracks to secretly embark) puts a gun to his head. He demands the money, but when Joe opens the suitcase... it contains only old newspapers and the bottle of champagne. Joe then says that Dawn has cheated all of them and convinces Sarge to work together to find her. They decide to open the bottle of champagne to seal the deal, but while Joe looks at his glass and wonders why there are no bubbles, Sarge drinks straight out of the bottle and almost immediately begins to writhe in pain as the concentrated LSD takes effect. When the train arrives at the next station, Joe throws the suitcase into the trash and walks away.Some time later, Dawn checks into a Southern California resort and is happily reunited with Joe, telling him that she knew that they would never kill him as long as he did not have the money."

Although Charlie's chances of getting a golden ticket are remote at best - especially against a glutton, a spoiled peanut heiress, a gum fanatic and a television fanatic - Charlie wants it more than anyone else and is the small dream which is keeping his spirit alive. Those that eventually get the golden tickets will be exposed to all of Wonka's magical secrets, the latest rumored to be that of the everlasting gobstopper, a candy that never gets smaller. But they will also be treated to an experience that some will hopefully learn from. And one will learn the real reason for Wonka providing access to the factory. But if five are allowed access, others may also try to gain access, such as a devious Slugworth, who will be ruined if the gobstopper hits the markets before he finds out its secret.—Huggo The world is agog when chocolate and candy maker Willy Wonka announces that five golden tickets granting access to his factory are to be found in his eponymous chocolate bar. For young Charlie, getting hold of one of those tickets would be a dream come true. The family has little money but his Grandpa Joe encourages him to have faith and keep a positive attitude. The one chocolate bar he buys doesn't have a ticket but when he finds a dollar on the street and gets another, he strikes gold at last. The five children are admitted to the factory and find a wonderland of candies and chocolate. Willy Wonka tells them they can have anything they want - but he is definitely looking for something in return.—garykmcd More than anything in the world, Charlie Bucket, an impecunious but honest paperboy, yearns to get the chance to set foot in cryptic chocolatier Willy Wonka's mysterious confectionery factory. Then, unexpectedly, the world's greatest candy-maker announces a worldwide contest: whoever comes up with one of out of five rare golden passes hidden in his famous and delectable Wonka Bars, will win a free tour of the factory, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Miraculously, Charlie finds the fifth ticket, and, alongside with his beloved Grandpa Joe, and four other winning kids with their guardians, enter the gates of the reclusive candy mogul's plant, to witness firsthand the wonders of chocolate-making. Indeed, this is a dream come true; however, only one visitor gets to win the grand prize. Will Charlie pass Willy's decisive final test?—Nick Riganas Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) is a poor, but hopeful, brave, wise and honest boy who lives in poverty with his widowed mother and four grandparents. On his way home from school one day, his newspaper route takes him past the gate of the town's mysterious, but highly-regarded candy-maker, Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder)'s Chocolate Factory. As Charlie peers through the gates, a tinker appears behind Charlie and tells him that nobody ever goes into Wonka's Factory, and nobody ever comes out of it either.Later that night, Charlie discusses this with his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). Joe explains that the tinker was right. Many years ago, other candy makers, especially Arthur Slugworth, were sending in spies dressed as workers to steal Wonka's secret recipes. Finally, Mr. Wonka laid off all of his workers, closed the factory and vanished. Three years later, the factory started up again, and more candies and chocolates were coming out, but the gates stayed locked, so that no one would steal their recipes. The identities of Wonka's new workers remains a mystery.The next day at school, word, news and announcements spread quickly that a contest has been launched, hidden among five out of billions of Wonka's chocolate bars are five golden tickets. The big prize is that those who find these tickets, will receive a lifetime supply of chocolate and get to visit Mr. Wonka's long-isolated factory for a free tour. The world then goes crazy, with Wonka chocolates being sold out at almost every store.The first ticket is found by a gluttonous greedy German boy, named Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner). The second is found by a spoiled and bossily immature little girl named Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), whose father utilized his peanut factory workers to open Wonka bars from dawn until dusk. The third is found by a girl named Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), who is an avid gum chewer, having chewed a piece of gum for three months straight to achieve a world record. The fourth is found by a boy named Mike TeeVee (Paris Themmen), who is obsessed with guns and television, particularly westerns.A mysterious, man (Gunter Meisner) always shows up and whispers into the ticket winners' ears.While these children claim the tickets in turn, and while various adults go to absurd lengths to find the tickets on their own, Charlie spends one night wandering about town thinking of what'll happen if he misses out. Grandpa Joe uses his tobacco money to buy two Wonka bars, one at a time, for Charlie. Neither bar contains a ticket. But the bond between Charlie and his Great Grandfather is all the stronger for that.Finally, a Paraguayan television network announces that a millionaire, living in the Andes, has claimed the fifth ticket. With (no more tickets to hunt for, the world gets back to normal. Charlie is heartbroken at the chance he missed, but is back at school the next day, doing his best to put it all behind him.On his way to deliver newspapers, he finds some money in a storm drain next to the candy shop. He fishes out the coin and goes in to buy Wonka Chocolates, including a regular Wonka bar. Then as he goes to claim his papers to start his route, he overhears a commotion over a headline: ""FIFTH TICKET FRAUD"". While a crowd of adults is talking about the Paraguayan's con, Charlie starts, very slowly, to unwrap the Wonka bar he bought and finds the fifth golden ticket.Charlie's discovery electrifies the towns folk: one of their own has claimed the genuine fifth ticket. His fanfare consists of holding it up and celebrating for about a minute or so with his paper-route customers, his boss, Mr. Jopeck and anyone who happens to be looking on--no big deal compared to the media hype that greeted the other children, but that doesn't matter, not to Charlie. What matters is at last he will get a chance to walk into the factory that has mystified him all his life. The ticket also entitles him to a lifetime supply of chocolate. Mr. Jopeck helps Charlie, still holding the ticket out of the crowd and tells him to hold onto the ticket and to run straight home and not stop until he gets there, which Charlie does very happily.But as Charlie turns the corner, he runs into the very man who has insinuated himself into all the other celebrations (though Charlie, not being media-savvy, doesn't know this). The man introduces himself as Arthur Slugworth and offers Charlie 10,000 stock certificates if he will quietly abstract from the factory a secret prototype recipe of an Everlasting Gobstopper formula.Charlie rushes the rest of the way home and announces his find. Grandpa Joe reads the ticket's terms which says the tour is October first, which is the next day. Under them, the holder may bring one adult family member as a chaperone. Charlie selects Grandpa Joe, who happily agrees and manages to get out of bed for the first time in 20 years.The next morning, the town puts on a celebration, with a band, to see the opening of the factory doors. Promptly at ten o'clock, the door opens. Out walks Willy Wonka, leaning heavily on a cane, and follows a pathway on the pavement. He gets to the end of the path, and leaves the cane behind, stuck into the ground. And then he leans over, and is about to fall...and finishes with a somersault, setting the entrance sets for the adventure that follows.He calls all the ticket holders to step forward. Verruca Salt insists on going in first, though hers was the second ticket. Neither of the other kids care about which order they go in though. The kids introduce themselves and Wonka greets them, the other four kids parents, (for the girls, their fathers, for Augustus and Mike, their mothers), and Grandpa Joe.Wonka leads them all inside, where first he asks the kids to sign a contract with print that starts out large and ends in being very small.After the kids have all signed the contract, the tour begins. The first stop is the chocolate room, which includes a candy land with a river of chocolate and other sweets. The visitors meet Wonka's workers, short dwarfish men with orange skin and green hair known as Oompa-Loompas, who Wonka transported to work and live at the factory from their country of Loompaland, which is revealed to be a terrible monstrous jungle country.Inside the tour that follows, the kids, one by one, fall victim to temptation that play upon their most profound weaknesses of character. Augustus Gloop falls into the river of chocolate and gets sucked up in an extractor pipe.
They go through a dark tunnel on Wonka's Wonkatania boat and visit the Inventing room, where Violet starts chewing on an unfinished experimental prototype gum that is supposed to have all the taste of a three-course dinner with blueberry pie for dessert, and seems to transform into a giant talking blueberry. Veruca, the selfish ingrate, falls through an educated ""Egg-Dicator"", which can tell the difference between good and bad golden chocolate Easter eggs laid by giant golden geese, and down the garbage chute where all the bad ones go and her father follows her down. Mike, impressed by Wonka's newest invention called ""Wonkavision"", which can shrink down Giant Wonka bars and transmit them through television, goes through it and ends up reduced into a tiny little person to about a twelfth of his normal size.Charlie and Grandpa Joe also given into temptation. In between the girls' mishaps, they sample Fizzy Lifting Drinks and end up floating up a chimney and risk running into an exhaust fan. They manage to burp their way down, and rejoin the others. But at the end of the tour, Wonka thanks the two for coming and heads into his office--which, when Charlie and Grandpa Joe open the door, turns out to have furnishings sawn in half--half a clock, half a sink, half a table--and half a desk, where Wonka sits on half a chair. Grandpa Joe asks about the lifetime supply of chocolate the ticket promised. Wonka replies Charlie disqualified himself by stealing Fizzy Lifting drinks, which violated the contract.Grandpa Joe becomes angry at Wonka and suggests that Charlie give Slugworth the prototype Gobstopper as revenge, but Charlie can't bring himself to hurt Wonka intentionally, and approaches Wonka one last time and sets the Candy on his desk.All of a sudden, Wonka joyously declares Charlie has won, reinstates the chocolate prize and reveals that ""Slugworth"" is actually an employee of his named Mr. Wilkinson; the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test for the kids, which only Charlie passed.Wonka then says that there's so much to do and leads Charlie and Grandpa Joe into the Great Glass Wonka-Vator, a multi-directional glass Elevator that can go to any room in the factory. Wonka says that up until now he has pressed all but one button in the craft and encourages Charlie to press it. That one button press sends the craft, and the three, through the glass ceiling and into the sky floating around town to a height that shows a view of the factory and the town around it. Wonka asks Charlie how he liked the factory, to which Charlie thinks it's the most wonderful place in the whole world. Wonka is pleased that Charlie loves the factory and is giving it to him, to Charlie and Grandpa Joe's surprise. Wonka reveals that the golden ticket contest was created to help him find an heir to run his factory and look after the Oompa Loompas. To make the deal sweeter, Wonka says Charlie and his family can move in right away. Charlie enthusiastically accepts this ultimate award and they fly off into the sky as the credits roll."
Nicholas and Alexandra,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Tsar Nicholas II, the inept last monarch of Russia, insensitive to the needs of his people, is overthrown and exiled to Siberia with his family. The tragic story of Nicholas II (Michael Jayston), the last Czar of Russia, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. It is an inside look into the private lives of Nicholas and his wife Alexandra (Janet Suzman), their daughters, their only son, and the painful secret about their son and heir apparent which bound the Imperial Couple to the mystical Grigori Rasputin (Tom Baker), and the eventual execution of the entire family.—Gailene Va. Holley <gvah@lava.net> Epic tale of the last years of Russia's Romanov dynasty, from the birth of Prince Alexei in 1904 until the family's execution in 1918. The Romanovs are absolute rulers, amongst the last of their kind in Europe, living in luxury while the vast majority of Russians lived in absolute poverty. Russia is also involved in a costly war with Japan over the Korean peninsula, and the Czar rejects all recommendations that he bring the war to an end. Moderate reformers argue in favor of a constitutional monarchy as is found in the United Kingdom, but Nicholas (Michael Jayston) will hear nothing of it, continuing his father's harsh policies and retaining absolute control. Revolutionaries abound, and the rise of the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin (Michael Bryant), Joseph Stalin (James Hazeldine), and Leon Trotsky (Brian Cox), slowly begin to gain an advantage. The Czar's decision, against advice, to authorize a general mobilization in 1914 leads to the disaster (for them) of World War I on the front, and Czarina Alexandra's (Janet Suzman's) insistence on relying on Father Grigori, a.k.a. Rasputin (Tom Baker), for advice further alienates the family from those who nominally support them. With the Russian people starving and general strikes spreading across the country, the Czar is forced to abdicate. Before the year is out, the Bolsheviks will be in power, and the Romanovs in custody. The entire family, the Czar, Czarina, four daughters, and one son, were executed in July 1918.—garykmcd The film covers the last 15 years in the lives of Nicholas (Michael Jayston) and Alexandra (Janet Suzman), the last Czar and Czarina of Russia, and their family. The story starts in 1904 with the birth of Alexei, the last of five children and the only son, who Nicholas and Alexandra see as the continuation of the 300-year-old Romanov dynasty. Global forces seem to be shifting, which threatens that dynasty. Other countries, such as Britain, have a monarchy that is largely symbolic, where the key decisions are made by an elected parliament, unlike the Russian duma, which is under Nicholas' control. Many of Nicholas' decisions have led to poverty and starvation amongst the Russian populace, especially among the working and peasant classes. Those unpopular decisions include the unnecessary war with Japan over Korea; Nicholas wanted an ice-free port in the Pacific, at the price of Russian lives. Many of these decisions are also against the advice of his inner circle of government ministers. There is an uprising of the working class, and Vladimir Lenin (Michael Bryant) has formed the Bolshevik Party under Marxist ideals. Government actions against the working class, sanctioned by Nicholas or not, lead to greater public dissatisfaction with his rule. But the greatest threat to the Romanov dynasty may be Alexandra. Her unpopularity grows through her association with Siberian peasant and self-professed holy man Grigori Rasputin (Tom Baker), who states that he is the voice of God. Alexandra, a highly devout woman, is grasping at anything that will keep hemophiliac Alexei alive. She sees her faith in Father Grigori as the only reason Alexei has survived as long as he has. Her unpopularity increases even more with the onset of World War I, as Russia is at war with Germany and she is from a German background.—Huggo Based on the bestselling biography by Robert K. Massie, but less sympathetic to its main characters, ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" follow the last thirteen years in the life of Russia's Emperor and Empress as they face personal heartache, disloyalty and Revolution. Michael Jayston, Janet Suzman, Irene Worth, Sir Michael Redgrave, Dame Diana Quick, Brian Cox and Tom Baker star."
The Andromeda Strain,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066769/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A team of top scientists work feverishly in a secret, state-of-the-art laboratory to discover what has killed the citizens of a small town and learn how this deadly contagion can be stopped. When virtually all of the residents of Piedmont, New Mexico, are found dead after the return to Earth of a space satellite, the head of the US Air Force's Project Scoop declares an emergency. Many years prior to this incident, a group of eminent scientists led by Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill) advocated for the construction of a secure laboratory facility that would serve as a base in the event an alien biological life form was returned to Earth from a space mission. Stone and his team - Drs. Dutton, Leavitt and Hall (David Wayne,Kate Reid, andJames Olson, respectively)- go to the facility, known as Wildfire, and try to first isolate the life form while determining why two people from Piedmont (an old wino and a six-month-old baby) survived. The scientists methodically study the alien life form unaware that it has already mutated and presents a far greater danger in the lab, which is equipped with a nuclear self-destruct device should it manage to escape.—garykmcd When a US satellite falls from orbit in the New Mexico desert, all but 2 inhabitants of a nearby town die mysteriously.

They encouraged us to tell the story accurately and in detail. The documents presented here are soon to be made public. They do not in any way jeopardize the national security.""FIRST DAY (February 5, 1971)Two Air Force men, Lt. Shawn (Mark Jenkins) and Sgt. Crane (Peter Helm) peer at the little hamlet of Piedmont, New Mexico, population 68, through night vision goggles. They drive their van into town, all the while they are in direct communication with Vandenberg AFB, Scoop Mission Control. They talk to Lt. Comroe (Carl Reindel) and report progress. They report, ""We see bodies, lots of them."" Before they can retrieve the satellite they are attacked by, ""something in white."" Lt. Comroe calls Major Mancheck.Major Mancheck (Ramon Bieri) requests a reconnaissance flyby over the town. He requests, ""Infrared. A FLIR scan, all sectors. Film to come direct to Scoop."" An F-4 Phantom jet criss-crosses the area taking photographs. The pilot is surprised to see all the dead bodies scattered across a wide area. Mancheck and Comroe review the film. Mancheck declares a State of Emergency, and restricts all personnel to base. He enters a small closet, unlocks a red telephone, and calls a special number. He leaves a message, ""I recommend calling a Wildfire Alert. We have evidence here on film of unnatural death caused by Scoop 7 returning to earth."" He hangs up the phone. Five scientists are activated and collected: Stone, Leavitt, Dutton, Kirke and Hall.A party in an upscale Berkeley neighborhood in California is underway. Mrs. Allison Stone (an uncredited Susan Brown) answers the doorbell. She is surprised when MP Capt. Morton (John Carter) and his aide (an uncredited Michael Bow) appear and insist on seeing Dr. Stone. Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill) reacts as if he knew they would arrive which upsets his wife even more than she already is. Morton calmly tells Stone, ""There's a fire, sir."" Morton assures Mrs. Stone that Dr. Stone will be fine and they leave. Stone reviews a file on Project Scoop on the drive to San Francisco International Airport. Allison Stone frantically calls her father, a U.S. Senator, and tries to report the strange abduction of her husband. The phone line is cut and a voice warns Mrs. Stone, ""This communication is being monitored. The connection has been broken for reasons of national security. You will be briefed at the appropriate time. Thank you for your cooperation, Mrs. Stone."" General Sparks (Peter Hobbs) calls Dr. Stone, who is alone on a large commercial jet airliner, and tells him, ""I just wanted to inform you that all members of your team have been cleared and are now being called in, except for Professor Kirke. He's in the hospital: Appendectomy.""At the Dutton residence, Clara Dutton (Frances Reid) packs a bag for her husband, Dr. Charles Dutton (David Wayne). His daughter enters the bedroom with a cup of coffee and asks, ""Germ warfare people, Dad? A lab accident?"" His grandson enters the bedroom, and excitedly exclaims, ""Grandpa, there's a car, and they got guns."" Outside in the snow is a green military vehicle surrounded by three soldiers. At her lab, Dr. Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid) is working when two Air Force officers inform her of a fire. Her assistant, Bess (an uncredited Midori), gets her some water to take a pill, and tells one man, ""All Dr. Leavitt needs is rest."" The major (Richard Bull) is in no mood for Leavitt's brand of humor, but is relieved when she tells him, ""Relax. I'm going with you."" In a hospital Operating Room, Dr. Mark Hall (James Olson) is just about to make an incision on his patient when the hospital administrator (an uncredited Paul Bellantyne) tells him to break scrub and be in the surgeon's conference room in thirty seconds.SECOND DAY (February 6, 1971)A helicopter takes off from Vandenberg AFB at 8:00 a.m. The pilot, Dempsey (an uncredited James W. Gavin) flies Doctors Stone and Hall, in white space suits, to Piedmont, New Mexico. Stone explains to Hall that the satellite isn't radioactive, but may have brought back a space germ. Hall asks why he was chosen. He is told he is an MD, he knows blood chemistry and most importantly that he is single. Stone is annoyed that Hall has not been reading the Wildfire materials he has been sending the doctor.We jump ahead in time to April 14, 1971 and the closed hearing of the Senate Committee on Space Sciences in Washington, D.C. Senator Phillips, the senator from Vermont (Eric Christmas) chides General Sparks about Dr. Stone. Senator McKenzie (an uncredited David McLean) from New Mexico expresses disagreement with his colleague about Dr. Stone. Sparks relays that Dr. Stone didn't know anything about Project Scoop. He and Stone were consultants with NASA on the Lunar Receiving Lab. Stone felt a more advanced lab was required to isolate and study any extra-terrestrial germ that may be encountered in the future. Stone wrote a letter asking that a facility be funded and built for such a purpose. Phillips objected to the cost, $90 million.In the present day, the helicopter approaches the small town. Buzzards are picking at the dead bodies, so gas canisters are dropped to kill the birds. Stone and Hall investigate the town, while the helicopter hovers a safe distance away. They find the townsfolk cut down in mid-stride, all dead. Some appear to have committed suicide. They retrieve the satellite from the residence of Dr. Alan Benedict (an uncredited Jason Johnson), the town doctor. Hall notes that Benedict's blood has turned to powder, and realizes just how dangerous this new organism is to the world. On their way out they hear a baby cry. They only find two people in town still alive: Jackson (George Mitchell) an elderly wino, and an infant, Manuel Rios (an uncredited Robert Soto). Before they leave, Stone tells Mancheck by radio, ""The town is finished, contaminated beyond all...Order up a 7-12.""In the White House Situtaiton Room, the time is 2:40 p.m. EST. Mr. Grimes (Richard OBrien), special assist to the President, meets with Dr. Robertson (Kermit Murdock), science advisor. A Cabinet Secretary (an uncredited Glenn Langan) advises, ""It's against the Moscow Treaty of 1963 to fire thermonuclear weapons above ground."" Grimes gets a call from the President. He is told that the National Guard will cordon off the area around Piedmont, and a decision to cauterize the area, via a 7-12, will be delayed 24 to 48 hours. Ed, the Assistant to the Cabinet Secretary (an uncredited Walter Brooke) is told to handle the National Guard deployment.Back at the hearing, Sen McKenzie asks who decided on the location for the Wildfire Lab. Sparks tells him that Dr. Stone wanted an uninhabited area.It is close to noon and Dr. Dutton is driving Dr. Leavitt to the Wildfire facility in southern Nevada. The surface structure is disguised to look like an old building run by the Department of Agriculture. They enter the building, and after Dutton provides the guard a pass-phrase, they walk to a storeroom. The floor drops away and they are taken down some distance underground to the first level of Wildfire. Stone and Hall enter a decontamination chamber in their white suits and are irradiated. Dutton tells Leavitt he thinks the capsule may have been brought back with the infection deliberately. Their final step before entry is a palm print analyzer that verifies identification. Dutton tells Leavitt, ""It gives you final clearance to enter Wildfire."" Hall and Stone greet Dutton and Leavitt, then they all proceed to the communications room on Level 1. Stone asks Sgt. Burk (Joe Di Reda) if there are any messages from the White House. Burk is annoyed, but gives them the brief tour of the teletype machine. ""I listen for a little bell in here. Ding-a-ling. That means a message coming in is for the Wildfire Team. No messages yet.""The team changes and meets for a briefing. Stone gives Hall a special red metal key on a chain. Stone arms the nuclear device at the bottom of the complex. He explains that in an emergency it is activated automatically, and Hall's key is the only thing that can disarm it. He further explains, ""There's a five-minute delay between the time detonation locks in and the bomb explodes."" Hall is confused and Leavitt tells him, ""You should have done your homework, sport."" She explains the ""Odd-Man Hypothesis"" that unmarried males are best suited to decide on the use of nuclear weapons. Stone shows Hal, via an electronic diagram, where he can find the stations where he can cancel self-destruct with his key. He also explains that it will take 16 hours to descend to Level 5, and that each level is cleaner than the one above. They start the decontamination and immunization process, the time is 5:10 p.m. On Level 4, they rest for 6 hours and are told to meet after that in the cafeteria.THIRD DAY (February 7, 1971)Hall joins the others at a table in the cafeteria. All they consume is a glass of Nutrient 42-5, which Hall describes as tasting like orange juice. Stone explains, ""Developed for the astronauts. Eight ounces satisfy all daily nutritional requirements."" Stone tells the team he has planned the work in three stages: 1) detection, 2) characterization and 3) control: how to contain and exterminate. They head for Level 5. It is now 4:33 a.m.Hall asks Dutton how he can examine his patients if they are sealed off. He is told that entire rooms are set up like glove-boxes. The two men join Leavitt and Stone in Main Control. Stone is using robotic ""hands"" to open the satellite. They use a lab rat to see if the open capsule has contaminated the air inside the sealed work chamber. Sure enough, when the sealed cage is opened, the animal quakes and shutters and dies in a few seconds. Next they expose a rhesus monkey to the air, and like the rat, it dies in a few seconds. Stone decides that he and Leavitt will scan the capsule, Dutton will do the necropsies on the animals, and Hall will examine his patients.Hall enters the patient exam/med lab complex. He meets Karen Anson (Paula Kelly) and asks, ""What's been done for them?"" Karen replies, ""Just plasma for the old man, dextrose for the baby."" Karen explains the computer, Medcom, handles all medical decisions and lab work. She briefs Hall on the equipment and the body suit glove box. Hall orders blood work, then Karen and Hall enter the exam room via their suits. In the Main Control Room, Stone and Leavitt are examining the satellite with remote scanners. She intimates that what they are searching for was deliberately brought back to Earth. In autopsy, Toby (Ken Swofford) is the technician helping Dutton with his vector studies. Like the medical facility, Toby is in a full body glove box suit. Dutton chides Toby to be more careful and use the ""hands"" to minimize exposure. They verify that Andromeda is still present and still lethal and transmitted by the air. The use of various filters yields knowledge that the size is 1-2 microns: the size of a bacterium. Dutton calls Stone and Leavitt to let them know what he has discovered, so far. Stone and Leavitt start their scan on the inside of the satellite. They eventually concentrate on a small pebble and some green substance that looks like paint. Hall examines his patients and reviews the blood results. He talks to Jackson but gets very little useful information. He tries to examine the baby, but it is clear he has no experience with babies. Dutton calls to show him the isotope scan: it shows how Andromeda gets into the body. As they suspected, it is inhaled, ""The clotting begins in the lungs and spreads outward."" Ruth is tired, and annoyed that Stone will not concentrate on the obvious clue, the indentation and pebble, and of course, the green stuff. They zoom in on the green substance and it flinches and grows under 440 magnification. They examine the green material at 1,000 magnification and both see it move. Stone calls for a technician, then operates the hands to remove the pebble for microchemistry examination. The MIC-T (an uncredited Michael Pataki) arrives and praises Stone's technique with the equipment.Hall now knows Jackson's blood is too acid, but not why. He learns the man has an ulcer, but the still doesn't know why the baby is still alive.Meanwhile, a pilot flying over the Piedmont area at 23,000 feet experiences trouble. The oxygen mask he is wearing begins to disintegrate. His F-4 Phantom jet crashes in Utah near the Four-Corners area.At the hearing, some months later, it is disclosed that messages for the Wildfire team were routed but the alarm, ""was knocked out by a sliver of paper...the sliver had peeled from the roll and wedged between the bell and striker, preventing the bell from ringing.""It is now 12 Noon, and Dutton tells Hall he thinks they are being held incommunicado and that what Scoop found was no accident. ""I suspect they were looking for the ultimate biological weapon."" Stone and Leavitt enter the break room to join their colleagues. Stone proudly announces, ""We've isolated the organism. It's in microchemistry.""At the crash site in Utah, Major Mancheck arrives with his team and they learn about the rubber dissolving from the pilot's recorded mayday call. An investigator informs them that the F-4 does not contain rubber, but a new synthetic called Polycron. It is similar in characteristics to human skin, which explains the human bones found in the Jet. The investigator tells Mancheck that either a chemical reaction or a micro-organism entered the cockpit which dissolved the pilot's Polycron-oxygen mask which caused the pilot to become disoriented from lack of oxygen and it led the jet to crash.Back at Wildfire, the entire team is now in the Microchemistry lab. Their analysis of the rock indicates it is a plastic of some sort. The green substance is even simpler, it is composed of only four elements: Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen. A more detailed analysis indicates the total absence of amino acids. Stone refocuses the group to study of the organism, specifically, ""We're halfway home if we find out what will keep that from growing."" Hall wants to concentrate on his patients, specifically what they have in common.Ruth reviews the growth results, but misses the culture in Alkaline, due to a red flashing message, ""No Growth."" Ruth zones out and does not hear the alarm for the midnight conference.FOURTH DAY (February 8, 1971)Hall, Dutton, and Stone are meeting. Hall concludes it must be a blood disorder. The bickering between Hall and Leavitt prompts Stone to call for a 6-hour rest period. Dutton suggests they requests a code name be obtained: Andromeda Strain is assigned. Hall notices that messages for the team were never relayed to the team. The 7-12 was never carried out over Piedmont. Stone is furious and calls the communications center to chew the Sergeant Out. He demands to talk to Dr. Robertson in Washington, D.C. Grimes and Robertson inform the Wildfire team of the Phantom Jet that crashed and the dissolving rubber. Stone emphasizes that the 7-12 must be expedited (but Stone and the team dismiss the dead pilot's claim of rubber dissolving-incorrectly assuming that the pilot was infected by Andromeda).At about 3:00 a.m. the team isolates a cell piece of the green substance. They discover it is a crystal, which now explains why Andromeda lives without amino acids. It converts energy into nourishment. Despite its isolation in the electron microscope the crystal divides and multiplies. Stone exclaims, ""In a vacuum, bombarded by electrons? It shouldn't even be alive!"" Ruth explains that the growth program shows Andromeda can live on anything, ""Only gas and light affect it."" They finally conclude, to their shock and horror, that a thermonuclear detonation would only allow their new discovery to mutate and grow into a super-colony in one day.They call Dr. Robertson back and Stone directs Robbie to disarm the self-destruct mechanism at Wildfire. When they tell the computer to explain Andromeda's function, it overloads and returns the message: 601. They now know that Andromeda divides and mutates with no Earth-bound checks and balances to stop it. Stone calls up a map simulation to show how it might spread. Dutton and Leavitt are shocked and disappointed to see and learn that Wildfire was developed for germ warfare simulations and Andromeda was already programmed in as the designated weapon. Stone tries to mitigate the situation, then deflect criticism by redirecting their efforts to finding an antidote.A little later, as Hall and Karen are with the baby, a yellow light flashes and a bell rings an alarm. Karen points at the light and explains to Hall, ""Contamination!"" A voice over the PA explains, ""A seal has broken in autopsy. Emergency procedures are in effect."" Hall gets Leavitt on the way to the autopsy lab, but Ruth is frozen in place when she sees the flashing red alarm signal light overhead. She falls to the floor and foams at the mouth with a seizure. Hall has trouble getting help with Leavitt, as the personnel around think she is infected with Andromeda. Karen assists with the treatment when Hall tells her it is only epilepsy.Dutton is in the autopsy lab and admits, ""I'm scared. Oh, Lord, I'm scared."" Stone feeds Dutton pure Oxygen as Hall explains what happened to Leavitt. Hall is surprised that Dutton is still alive. Hall finally concludes that blood pH is the answer. After Hall and Stone run a quick growth program, they finally see that Andromeda can only survive in a narrow band of pH: Acid vs. Alkaline between 7.39 and 7.43. Then Stone notices the lab rat, exposed longer than Dutton, is also still alive. He concludes, ""Andromeda's mutated to a noninfectious form."" Unfortunately, Stone also notices a message on the console, ""EARLY DEGENERATIVE CHANGE IN GASKET.""The Andromeda virus is now consuming the Polycron gaskets around the facility, causing the micro-organism to contaminate Wildfire. With all the gaskets decomposed, another red light and alarm sounds and the doors in Level 5 begin to seal off. Hall is unable to get to a substation to deactivate the 5-minute countdown to detonation. Hall cuts his way through the glove box suit and enters the central core. Gas and lasers protect the area from escaped lab animals. Hall climbs to Level 4, but it is now sealed. He shakes off the shock from being struck by two laser shots: one to the back of his hand and one to his face. He gets to Level 3 and inserts his key in the substation.Hall wakes up in the Infirmary some time later with Karen standing next to him. Ruth Leavitt, with her usual brand of irony, tells Hall, ""Eight seconds to spare. Hardly even exciting."" Dutton tells Hall the super-colony is now off the coast and rain will wash it into the ocean where it will die.At the Senate Hearing two months later, Senator Phillips asks Dr. Stone, ""This cloud seeding business, you absolutely sure it worked?"" Stone replies, ""All reports indicate the experiment was successful."" He further admits they are continuing to study Andromeda at Wildfire and postulates that another biological crisis can occur. The senator tartly asks, ""What do we do about that?"" Stone grimly redirects the question with, ""Precisely, Senator. What do we do?""We close with a view of a computer simulation of Andromeda growing (showing that although contained, the Andromeda virus remains unpredictable), and then the ominous error message, ""601"" flashing on the screen.End credits"
Night of Dark Shadows,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067491/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A painter and his wife move into a home and find themselves plagued by ghosts and spirits of his ancestors that used to be witches. Recently married, Quentin and Tracy Collins have just moved into Collinwood, a New England estate that has long been in the Collins family and which Quentin has just inherited. They have invited their married friends, Alex and Claire Jenkins, who write horror novels together, to live in a cottage on the estate rent free. An artist, Quentin wants to find somewhere in the mansion to do his painting that will, among other things, give him some inspiration. The estate's humorless housekeeper Carlotta Drake, who comes from a long line of domestics serving the Collins family at Collinwood, directs him to the room in the tower. After his first trip to the tower room where he finds many other paintings, Quentin begins to see visions and have nightmares including that of a young woman hanging dead in a tree outside the mansion, and a young girl in another window of the mansion holding a doll. With further information from Carlotta about those visions and nightmares, Quentin may be placing especially Tracy's life at risk staying at the estate if he is to believe Carlotta. That may indeed be the case as his behavior becomes more erratic, like he is possessed.—Huggo Handsome young artist Quentin Collins arrives at his newly inherited estate of Collinwood with his beautiful wife Tracy. They meet the housekeeper Carlotta Drake and the caretaker Gerard Stiles. Quentin happens upon a 19th-century portrait of a blonde woman with captivating green eyes that seem to mesmerize him. Carlotta informs him that the woman is Angelique, who had lived there over 100 years earlier. The Collins' friends Alex and Claire Jenkins, who have co-written several successful horror novels, move into a cottage on the estate. Quentin soon begins to be troubled by startling visions and haunting dreams about one of his ancestors, Charles Collins, and his ancestor's mistress Angelique-who had been hanged as a witch in a past century. Carlotta eventually reveals to Quentin that she is the reincarnation of Sarah Castle, a little girl who had lived at Collinwood over 150 years ago, and that Quentin himself is the reincarnation of Charles Collins. Charles had had an affair with Angelique, wife of his brother Gabriel, resulting in her being hanged-and Charles being sealed alive in the family crypt with Angelique's corpse.—yusufpiskin In Maine, Quentin Collins (David Selby) takes his bride Tracy (Kate Jackson) to Collinwood, an estate he has inherited from a distant relative but has never seen. Since the death of the former owner, Mrs. Stoddard, the estate has been maintained by the somber housekeeper, Carlotta Drake (Grayson Hall), and her nephew, Gerard Styles (James Storm), who serves as caretaker. Quentin and Tracy are at first thrilled with the beautiful estate, especially as they have invited their close friends, Gothic mystery novelists Alex and Claire Jenkins (John Karlen and Nancy Barrett), to live rent-free in the gatehouse. Despite the comforting feeling that he has come home, Quentin is uneasy about visions he begins to have: a woman hanged from a nearby tree and a little servant girl looking out the window.The old mansion has a large art collection and Quentin, a painter by profession, is taken with a portrait of a former inhabitant of the house, Angelique Collins (Lara Parker), who died in 1810. At Carlotta's suggestion, Quentin sets up his studio in the old tower room, which was used similarly by a previous resident. In a secret closet built into the wall he finds another, more seductively dressed image of Angelique.In the studio, Quentin has visions of Angelique being painted by her brother-in-law and lover, Charles Collins, and, in nightmares, sees that it is Angelique being hung as a witch. Quentin shares these visions with Tracy and the Jenkinses.On another night after another dream of Angelique, Quentin awakens and proceeds to the tower room, where the ghost of Angelique awaits him. As if reliving Charles's life, he begins to make love to her, but is interrupted by Gerard, whom the delusional Quentin confuses with Angelique's jealous husband Gabriel and attacks. Carlotta and Tracy are drawn by the noise, and Tracy runs to Quentin. However, Quentin, still believing he is Charles, tries to strangle Tracy, whom he sees as Charles's wife Laura. Later, after regaining his reason, Quentin worries for Tracy's safety, but she assures him that all will be well.The next day, while walking on the grounds, Alex narrowly escapes harm when parts of a dilapidated greenhouse collapse around him. Tracy, who is out riding a horse, sees the incident, and after assuring herself that Alex is unharmed, tells him about Quentin's behavior the night before.Uncomfortable in the tower, Quentin sets up his studio in a downstairs room, but Carlotta mysteriously tries to dissuade him. Although Quentin wants the portrait of Angelique removed, Carlotta returns it to its place on the wall. Angered by her insistence, Quentin accuses her of knowing about his dreams and demands an explanation. Carlotta claims that, in a previous incarnation, she was a little servant girl who worked for the Collins' family, Sarah Castle, and retains her memories of over 150 years ago. Like Quentin, she explains, she has lived before and remembers it. She tells him that Angelique will always love him and then recounts events that happened in their previous lives: Sarah eavesdrops when the conniving Laura, a minister and other men of the town ask for Gabriel's agreement to hang Angelique as a witch. They force their way into the tower room and, despite Charles' attempts to stop them, take Angelique down the stairs. Crying, Sarah runs to Angelique, whom she adores, and Angelique gives her a necklace, saying that as long as she wears it, Sarah will remember her. After Angelique's death, Sarah hears her voice telling her to keep her spirit alive and that someday she will know what she is to do.In the present, Carlotta says that Quentin will soon accept that he is Charles and that Tracy does not belong there. To Quentin's passionate declaration that he loves Tracy, Carlotta suggests that he leave Collinwood... if he can. On a walk with Tracy, Quentin tells her he needs her, but later sends her to bed alone. As if lured by Angelique, he returns to the tower room. When Tracy later awakens and knocks on the tower room door, he yells that he ""can't stand the sight"" of her and orders her never to return there.The next day, after the Jenkinses go to New York City to consult with an early American art specialist and Quentin goes to the nearby town of Collinsport for supplies, Tracy takes the key from Quentin's jacket, unlocks the tower and sees a painting of Quentin carrying the body of Angelique. When Quentin returns, Tracy hides from him and tries surreptitiously to return the key.That night, in their bedroom, after Quentin tells her he knows she was in the tower room and assures her that he is not angry, she admits that she is afraid. Tenderly he talks to her, but then abruptly becomes hostile, claiming that if she does not like it, she can leave. Meanwhile, the Jenkinses have returned with a portrait of Charles, who, except for a scar, looks exactly like Quentin. In the morning, they intend to show Quentin, hoping he will be convinced to vacate the mansion.However, during the night, Angelique haunts Alex, surrounding him in a thick, white, smoke-like substance that nearly kills him until he is awakened by Claire's scream. In the mansion, Tracy awakens and feels lured to a disused natatorium on the estate. Quentin is there and, believing he is Charles and she Laura, tries to drown her. Realizing the danger that threatens Quentin and Tracy, the Jenkinses drive to the mansion, but on their way, see Quentin leave the natatorium. Inside the building they find and revive Tracy.While Tracy and Claire return to the gatehouse, Alex proceeds to the house and confronts Quentin, who remembers nothing. When he discovers that Tracy is missing Quentin is at first concerned, but then the spirit of Charles overtakes him and he demands that Alex leave. Afterward, realizing that Alex was right about the danger facing them, Quentin prods Carlotta into revealing that Gerard is doing ""what has to be done."" As Quentin races to the gatehouse to save Tracy and his friends, Gerard ambushes Alex and runs him off the road, crashing the car, and then goes to the gatehouse. Upon discovering Gerard outside, Claire shoots and injures him, but he manages to slip inside and abduct Tracy. Quentin finds Gerard on the footbridge and in the ensuing fight, as Gerard attacks Quentin with a knife, Tracy finds a log and knocks him off the bridge to his death on railroad tracks below.Realizing the only way to exorcise Angelique's ghost is to find Carlotta because she keeps Angelique's spirit alive, they return to the mansion. Quentin and Tracy, lighting their way with candelabras, enter the cellars beneath the house, where Angelique traps Tracy in a room. Meanwhile, Alex corners Carlotta on the roof of the building, but, seeing Angelique beckon to her from below, she jumps to her death, after which Quentin frees Tracy.The next morning, after Quentin goes to town to arrange to sell the estate, he returns to the gatehouse, where Tracy and the Jenkinses are preparing to escape to Cape Cod. They leave in two separate cars, but at a fork in the road, Quentin heads toward the house, saying he must pick up his canvases. Promising to be quick, he leaves Tracy in the car, enters and collects his belongings, but then lingers. When Tracy goes in search of him, she discovers that he has acquired the characteristic limp and facial scar of Charles; Quentin is now possessed by the evil spirit of Charles Collins. Although at first confused, she then sees Angelique, who is present in the flesh, and screams as Quintin/Charles approaches her....A short time later, a news bulletin reports that the Jenkinses died in a highway accident, before which, according to witnesses, their car filled with thick white smoke..."
THX 1138,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066434/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the 25th century, a time when people have designations instead of names, a man, THX 1138, and a woman, LUH 3417, rebel against their rigidly-controlled society. Sometime in the future, conformity and homogeneity are the rule in a state-controlled society in which the populace follows the wants of the faceless statue without question. This is achieved through a mandatory drug regimen, which also suppresses human desire; human relationships and sexual intercourse are banned. The law of the state is policed by a force of robocops. The physical environment is totally within a manufactured enclosure; what's outside of it is completely unknown. THX 1138 is a loyal subject who goes about his business as a skilled factory worker building robocops. And even when he begins to have strange feelings, he does what is obligated by going to the state-run confessional, which further brainwashes through its reinforced mantra of happiness, loyalty, and understanding. THX 1138 is given a glimpse into the other side through his computer-matched and thus appointed female roommate, LUH 3417, and her surveillance colleague SEN 5241, LUH 3417's vision, which THX 1138 might want to continue despite its illegality. If THX 1138 is able to keep his activities from the authorities and the robocops, he will have to figure out what options are available to him.—Huggo George Lucas adapted this, his first film, from a short he made at University. THX 1138, LUH 3417, and SEN 5241 attempt to escape from a futuristic society located beneath the surface of the Earth. The society has outlawed sex, with drugs used to control the people. THX 1138 stops taking the drugs and gets LUH 3417 pregnant. They are both thrown in jail, where they meet SEN 5241 and start to plan their escape.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> The human race has been relocated to a underground city beneath the Earth's surface where the population is entertained by holographic TV that broadcasts sex and violence, and a robotic police force enforces the law. Society controls all life, all citizens are drugged to control their emotions and behavior, and sex is a crime. Factory worker THX 1138 stops taking the drugs, then breaks the law by falling in love with his roommate LUH 3417; when LUH 3417 gets pregnant, THX 1138 is jailed. Escaping from jail with illegal programmer SEN 5241 and a hologram named SRT, THX 1138 goes in search of LUH 3417 and escapes to the surface with robotic police in pursuit.—Daniel Williamson In the 21st century, sexual intercourse and reproduction are prohibited, whereas use of mind-altering drugs is mandatory to enforce compliance among the citizens and to ensure their ability to conduct dangerous and demanding tasks. Emotions, coitus, and the concept of family are taboo. Everyone is clad in identical uniforms and has shaven heads to emphasize equality, except the police androids (who wear black) and robed monks. Instead of names, people have designations with three arbitrary letters (referred to as the ""prefix"") and four digits, shown on an identity badge worn at all times.At their jobs in central video control centers, SEN 5241 and LUH 3417 keep surveillance on the city. LUH has a male roommate, THX 1138, who works in a factory producing android police officers. At the beginning of the story, THX leaves the job while the loudspeakers urge the workers to ""increase safety"" - and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period - to the competing factory's 242. On the way home, he stops at a confession booth in a row of many, and mumbles prayers about ""party"" and ""masses"", under the portrait of ""OMM 0000"". A soothing voice greets THX, and OMM ends every confession with a parting salutation: ""You are a true believer, blessings of the State, blessings of the masses. Work hard, increase production, prevent accidents and be happy"".At home, THX takes his drugs and watches holobroadcasts while engaging with a masturbatory device. LUH secretly substitutes pills in her possession for THX's medications, whereupon THX eventually suffers physical discomfort (vomiting) along with mental/emotional changes (confusion). The drug substitution also leads to LUH and THX becoming involved romantically, resulting in the two engaging in intercourse. THX later is confronted by SEN, who arranges THX as his new roommate, but THX files a complaint against SEN for the illegal housing mate change. Without drugs in his system, THX falters during a critical and hazardous phase of his job, and a control center engages a ""mind lock"" on THX which raises the level of danger. After the release of the mind lock, THX makes the necessary correction to that work phase. THX and LUH are arrested. THX enjoys a brief reunion with LUH, disrupted shortly after she reveals her pregnancy.At THX's trial, THX is sentenced to prison, alongside SEN. Most of the prisoners seem uninterested in escape, but eventually THX and SEN find an exit and they are later joined by hologram SRT 5752, who starred in the holobroadcasts. During the escape, THX and SRT are separated from SEN. Chased by the police robots, THX and SRT are trapped in a control center, from which THX learns that LUH has been ""consumed"", and her name has been reassigned to fetus 66691 in a growth chamber. SEN eventually escapes to an area reserved for the monks of OMM, where a lone monk notices that SEN has no identification badge. SEN attacks him and later wanders into a child-rearing area, strikes up a conversation with children, and sits aimlessly until police androids apprehend him. THX and SRT steal two cars, but SRT crashes his into a concrete pillar.Pursued by two police androids on motorcycles, THX flees to the limits of the city and escapes into a ventilation shaft. The police androids pursue him on motorcycles along the ventilation shaft to an escape ladder, but are ordered by Central Command to cease pursuit, on grounds that the expense of his capture exceeds their budget by 6%. The city is then revealed to be entirely underground, and THX has escaped onto the surface, where he then witnesses the sun setting."

Plaza Suite,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067589/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three vignettes, each set in room 719 of New York's Plaza Hotel, make up this comedy. Three separate stories concerning relationship issues are presented, each largely taking place in suite 719 of the Plaza Hotel in New York City. In story one, suburban New Yorkers Sam and Karen Nash are spending the night in the hotel as their house is being painted, but more importantly for Karen because it is their twenty-""something"" wedding anniversary, the hotel where they spent their honeymoon. While Karen wants to recreate the romance that she remembers of their wedding night, Sam is preoccupied with business matters. But it is other issues that highlight their fundamental differences that may demonstrate if they will make it to twenty-something plus one. In story two, womanizing Hollywood movie producer Jesse Kiplinger has exactly two hours free during his whirlwind stay in New York, which he wants to fill with a quickie. Of the many women he calls, the first to agree to meet at his suite is his old hometown flame, married Muriel Tate. Muriel, who knows what Jesse wants, he who she has not seen in fifteen years, is a bundle of nerves as she continuously second guesses herself in whether she should have come. And in story number three, there are a roomful of people in the Baroque Room of the hotel for the wedding and following reception of Borden Eisler and Mimsey Hubley, the event which is being paid for by Mimsey's penny-pinching father, Roy Hubley. What the people in the Baroque Room are unaware of is that Mimsey has locked herself in the bathroom of the hotel suite, but not saying a word to either her father or mother, Norma Hubley, as to the reason for her cold feet. As Roy and Norma try whatever they can to get Mimsey out of the bathroom while stalling the Eislers in the Baroque Room, Roy and Norma also focus on issues in their own relationship and how they raised Mimsey, which may be appropriate if they learn the reason for Mimsey's cold feet.—Huggo Film version of the Neil Simon play has three separate acts set in the same hotel suite in New York's Plaza Hotel with Walter Matthau in a triple role. In the first, Karen Nash tries to get her inattentive husband Sam's attention to spruce up their failing marriage. In the second, brash film producer Jesse Kiplinger tries to get his former one-time flame Muriel to see him for what he stands for. In the third, Roy Hubley and his wife Norma try and try to get their uncertain-of-herself daughter out of the bathroom before her approaching wedding.—Matthew Patay"
The Organization,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067535/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In San Francisco, Police Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs helps a group of idealistic vigilantes expose a drug ring controlled by powerful businessmen. After a group of young revolutionaries break into a corporation's headquarters and steal $5,000,000 worth of heroin to keep it off the street, they call on San Francisco Police Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs for assistance. Though sympathetic to their cause, the straight-arrow Tibbs refuses to consider it because they broke the law, but when the group is then accused of a murder it didn't commit, Tibbs finally joins them in order to ferret out the identity of the real killer, while keeping his now rogue undercover investigation a secret from his SFPD superiors.—Marty McKee <mmckee@wkio.com> A small group of ordinary citizens team up to topple over a drug ring called The Organization. They ask Lt. Virgil Tibbs to join, as they need his expertise. Tibbs is reluctant, as they are amateurs and, more importantly, have already committed several crimes in order to stop The Orgaization. It's only after a police colleague suspected to be on the take commits suicide that Tibbs finally joins them in order to learn the identity of a killer who's framed the group for murder.—Mattias Pettersson <seaman@sbbs.se> In the middle of the night in San Francisco, a group of six people wearing plastic masks pose as a maintenance crew in order to infiltrate the Century Furniture Factory. With silent efficiency, they kidnap factory manager John Bishop (Johnny Haymer), knock out guard George Morgan, and force Bishop to open the office vault, wherein lies their target: $4 million worth of heroin. Upon leaving, they blow up the building gate.Soon after, detective Lt. Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) and his partner, Lt. Jack Pecora (Gerald S. O'Loughlin), are called in to investigate and find Bishop dead at his desk. Tibbs begins by questioning Morgan, who was knocked out, about why the robbers would have blown up the gate when they could have made their escape without opening the gate. Assistant manager William Martin (Graham Jarvis) is also questioned, but has no idea why anyone would have killed Bishop, who has no obvious enemies.Upon returning to their office, the police learn that Bishop was shot with two guns, execution-style; that the robbers entered from outside a window five stories high; and that they had only four minutes after tripping the alarms to exit the building. Meanwhile, corporate executives Bob Alford (Fred Beir) and Zach Mills (John Lasell), the leaders of the drug syndicate that supplied Bishop with the heroin, speak to their colleagues in Istanbul and Paris. Using code, they inform them that the heroin has been stolen and Bishop killed.At home that night, Tibbs is bantering with his wife Valerie (Barbara McNair) and their children, Andy and Ginny, when he receives an anonymous phone call asking him to walk alone along a city street at a certain hour. Instructing Pecora to come after him in 30 minutes, Tibbs does as he is told and is soon ushered into an apartment where the robbers have gathered. Leader Juan Mendoza (Raul Julia) introduces Rev. Dave Thomas (Billy 'Green' Bush), Annie Sekido, Charlie Blossom, Stacy Baker and Joe Peralez, who admit they robbed the factory but insist that they did not murder Bishop. The vigilante group, each member of which has lost a loved one to drug addiction or overdose, wants to destroy ""the organization."" When they ask for Tibbs's help, pointing out that they deliberately blew up the gate in order to tip off the authorities, he refuses, stating that he cannot risk his career by banding with criminals without the knowledge of the police force. When he returns to Pecora, however, Tibbs says nothing about the group.That night, narcotics captain Grayson shoots himself, causing the men in the station to assume he was corrupt. After Bishop's wife lies to the police that she drove her husband to the factory the night of his murder, Tibbs realizes that she is being pressured not to admit that he was kidnapped. He arranges to meet Dave, Annie and Juan on a ferry, where he reluctantly acknowledges that they are not the killers and agrees to work with them, as long as they do not make a move without his approval.Tibbs re-questions Morgan, and when the guard refuses to admit that another car came in after the robbers broke in, Tibbs takes him in for further questioning. On way to the station, however, a car drives by and the passenger shoots Morgan, killing him before he can talk.Back at the station, Pecora wonders why Tibbs did not take him along to interrogate Morgan, but Tibbs deflects his questions and visits Morgan's widow Gloria to question her. She reveals that Morgan was rich, suggesting that Bishop was paying him off.Later, two toughs beat up Joe and offer him half a million dollars to meet them at Washington Square with information about where the heroin is hidden. Joe tells Juan, who urges him to meet the thugs in order to glean more information about them.Meanwhile, Pecora suggests that Tibbs call in the narcotics squad to help with the case, but Tibbs manages to hold him off. Joe goes to the designated meeting place and, while Juan and Annie watch nervously, a car arrives and takes him away. He shows the thugs a sample of the heroin and asks for $5 million, and in response, they threaten his life and order him to meet them that night. Annie, fearful for her friends, informs Tibbs, who instructs her to convince them that they must include him in their dealings, for their own safety. They arrange for Annie to call the station and anonymously tip off Pecora to the meeting point that night. As she hangs up the phone, however, the thugs follow her, and despite her efforts to elude them, they trap her in her car. Meanwhile, Jessop, the head of the narcotics division, assigns four men to help Tibbs and Pecora that night.The undercover police tail Joe, but when no one shows up at the meeting place, Tibbs is excoriated for wasting their time. Soon, Tibbs hears that Annie's dead body has been found, and meets the remaining five men to tell them that, because Annie was tortured to inform on them, they have been exposed and must flee. Tibbs and Pecora then question Martin again and, upon running through the complex alarm system with him, deduce that the murderers must have had an outside accomplice.Soon after, Tibbs learns from Dave that Joe's apartment is being watched by the thugs, and Tibbs rushes there, arriving just as the thugs run over Joe with their car. Although Tibbs arrests one of the men, the severely injured Joe blames the policeman for failing to protect him. When Jessop arrives at the hospital to question Joe, he learns of Tibbs's involvement, and soon Tibbs is called in to his superior, Capt. Stacy, and suspended for withholding information from the department. As Tibbs leaves, Jessop caustically informs him that Grayson killed himself not because he was corrupt but because he was dying of leukemia. Tibbs, unwilling to abandon the surviving vigilantes, asks his friend, the lawyer Sgt. Leo Chassman, for help in investigating Century. Chassman learns that the company has myriad ""dummy"" corporations as stockholders, and informs Tibbs about its complex financial workings.Meanwhile, Juan calls his friend Benjy, a small-time dealer, and offers to exchange the heroin for half a million dollars, on a crowded street. As Juan has hoped, Benjy arranges for the transfer with Alford and Mills, who arrive on the street to supervise the transaction. Just as Benjy and Juan swap bags, Charlie grabs the bag of heroin and runs off. While Tibbs's men, whom Juan has informed about the meeting, arrest Benjy, the organization's men chase Charlie into the unfinished subway system, followed by Tibbs. Together, Charlie and Tibbs shoot some of the thugs, and when the police arrive to finish the job, Tibbs runs off so they will not know he has been involved. He goes to Gloria's house and there casually reveals that he knows, based on the fact that Chassman's research has revealed that she is a major, wealthy stockholder in Century, who worked as a drug runner for the organization and facilitated Bishop's murder by tripping the alarms for the killers.After letting Pecora into the house, Tibbs advises Gloria to identify her bosses before they kill her, then uncovers a stash of heroin hidden inside a cut of beef in her refrigerator. Trapped, Gloria admits that Alford and Mills were behind the murder. The two men are arrested, but as they are being transported to testify, a sniper shoots them both before they can talk. Realizing that the organization will continue its dirty dealings, the reinstated Tibbs accepts a ride home from Pecora."

The Emigrants,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067919/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Småland, Sweden, mid-19th century. A farming family struggle with their rocky, unyielding land, and decide to embark on the arduous journey to new hope in America. In the middle of the 19th century, Kristina and Karl-Oskar live in a small rural village in Smaaland (southern Sweden). They get married and try to make a living on a small spot of land. However, the small size of their land, the infertile soil, and some bad harvests make it tough. One of their children even starves to death. Thus, they decide to emigrate to the U.S. They meet a group of farmers with their families planning the emigration under the leadership of a banned priest. They sell everything and embark for the U.S. The journey on the sailing ship is long and tedious. Some of the emigrants will never reach the New World.—Gerhard Windecker <g.wind@mbox300.swipnet.se> It's the mid-nineteenth century in the rural parish of Ljuder, located in Småland, Sweden. Young married couple Karl Oskar and Kristina are owner farmers, who, along with their neighbors have been having a difficult time of late because of lack of rain and poor soil, which has resulted in disastrous crops for several years. They can't feed themselves or their livestock. Kristina is despondent as they have several children, Kristina always seeming to be pregnant, and she doesn't see their lives ever getting any better. She is always praying to God for some redemption. Karl Oskar's younger brother, Robert, works as a farmhand for Aron. A romantic at heart, Robert lives in miserable conditions and is treated poorly by sadistic Aron. They don't see their lot in life getting any better in part because of the rigid class system in place. Even Kristina's uncle, Danjel, a highly devout man, is not allowed to spread the word of God, as that is solely the job of the wealthy ordained, which in his class Danjel will never become. Because of what Robert has read of America and because they have neighbors with relations who have already moved, Karl Oskar is eventually able to persuade Kristina to emigrate to pursue a better life, they not knowing that Robert was planning on running away to America anyway. Many of their neighbors and relations also decide to make the same journey, specifically planning on moving to Minnesota where they already know people. For those among them that survive the difficult journey, they will find that America may not be quite what they were expecting. In addition, some among their party may have ideas different than what was originally envisioned for the group as a collective.—Huggo It is the middle of the 19th century. A young couple, Kristina and Karl-Oskar, live in Smaland - a small rural community in southern Sweden. They survive on a small plot of infertile land. Times are difficult: there is bad weather, the harvests are poor and hunger prevails. Hunger forces the couple's first-born child to secretly eat food that was not ready for eating. This leads to the child's death and convinces the mother to accept the decision of the father to emigrate to the US. They are joined by another family running away from religious persecution and a man running away from a troublesome wife. The rest of the film traces their difficult journey on a rickety sailing ship that takes ten weeks to make it across the Atlantic and the inland journey to what is now Minnesota where the emigrants that survived the journey would start their new life in the New World.—Anonymous"
The Devils,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066993/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 17th-century France, Father Urbain Grandier's protection of the city of Loudun from the corrupt Cardinal Richelieu is undermined by a sexually repressed nun's accusation of witchcraft. Cardinal Richelieu and his power-hungry entourage seek to take control of 17th-century France, but need to destroy Father Grandier, the priest who runs the fortified town that prevents them from exerting total control. So they seek to destroy him by setting him up as a warlock in control of a devil-possessed nunnery, the Mother Superior of which is sexually obsessed with him. A mad witch-hunter is brought in to gather evidence against the priest, ready for the big trial.—Films Ranked In 17th Century France, Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Logue) is influencing King Louis XIII (Graham Armitage) in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from uprising. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its governor not to damage the town.Meanwhile in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier (Oliver Reed), a dissolute and proud but popular and well-regarded Catholic priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Mignon (Murray Melvin), another priest in the town, unaware that the deformed, neurotic Sister Jeanne (Vanessa Redgrave), head of the local convent, is sexually obsessed with him. She asks for Grandier to become the convent's new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeline De Brou (Gemma Jones), but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, driving her to insanity (this includes an attack where Sister Jeanne viciously attacks Madeleine when the latter brings back a book that the former had lent her, and Sister Jeanne accuses Madeleine of being a ""fornicator"" and ""sacrilegious bitch"", among other things).Baron de Laubardemont (Dudley Sutton) arrives with orders to demolish the city, overriding Grandier's orders to stop. Grandier summons the town's soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be her new confessor. She informs him of Grandier's marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her. Mignon relays this information to Laubardemont. In the process, the information is boiled down to just the claim that Grandier has bewitched the convent and has had commerce with the Devil. With Grandier away from Loudon, Laubardemont and Mignon decide to find evidence against him.Laubardemont summons the lunatic inquisitor Father Pierre Barre (Michael Gothard), a ""professional witch-hunter"", whose interrogations actually involve depraved acts of ""exorcism"", including the forced administration of enemas to his victims. Sister Jeanne claims that Grandier has bewitched her, and the other nuns do the same. A public exorcism erupts in the town, in which all of the nuns remove their clothes and enter a state of religious frenzy. Duke Henri de Condé (actually king Louis in disguise) arrives, claiming to be carrying a holy relic which can remove the ""devils"" possessing the nuns. Father Barre ""exorcises"" the nuns with it. They appear as though they have been cured until Condé/Louis reveals the case allegedly containing the relic to be empty. Despite this proof that the possessions and the exorcisms are a sham, both continue unabated, eventually descending into a massed orgy in which the nuns sexually assault and desecrate a statue of Christ.In the midst of the chaos, Grandier and his wife return and are immediately arrested. After being given a ridiculous show trial, Grandier is shaven and tortured although at his execution he eventually manages to convince Mignon that he is innocent. The judges, clearly under orders from Laubardemont, sentence Grandier to death by burning at the stake. Laubardemont has also obtained permission to destroy the city's fortifications. Despite pressure on Grandier to confess to the trumped-up charges, he refuses. He is then taken to be burnt at the stake. His executioner promises to strangle him rather than let him suffer the agonising death by fire that he would otherwise experience. However, the overzealous Barre starts the fire himself, and Mignon, now visibly panic-stricken about the possibility of Grandier's innocence, pulls the noose tight before it can be used to strangle the priest. As Grandier burns, Laubardemont gives the order for explosive charges to be set off and the city walls are blown up, causing the people to flee.After the execution, Barre leaves Loudun to continue his witch-hunting activities elsewhere in the southwest of France. Laubardemont informs Sister Jeanne that Mignon has been put away in an asylum for claiming that Grandier was innocent (the explanation given is that he is demented), and that ""with no signed confession to prove otherwise, everyone has the same opinion"". He gives her one of Grandier's charred bones and leaves. Sister Jeanne, now completely broken, masturbates pathetically with the charred femur. Grandier's wife, having been released is seen walking away from the ruined city as the film ends."

Packed with sticks of dynamite, Irish rebel and explosives expert John H. Mallory finds himself in Revolution-torn 1913 Mexico, on the run from the British government. Riding a dusty, V-twin Indian motorcycle, John crosses paths with short-fused Mexican bandit Juan Miranda and his gun-toting family of outlaws, and before long, his expertise in explosives becomes evident. Now, bent on putting Mallory's skills to good use, devious Juan forms an uneasy partnership with John to rob the impregnable Mesa Verde National Bank. Instead, what seemed like an unmissable opportunity to get rich becomes a trap, enmeshing the unlikely duo in the Revolution, having no other choice but to fight together with the troops of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata against the evil Colonel Günther Reza. Can John's dynamite get them out of the tight spot?—Nick Riganas In Mexico at the time of the Revolution, Juan, the leader of a bandit family, meets John Mallory, an IRA explosives expert on the run from the British. Seeing John's skill with explosives, Juan decides to persuade him to join the bandits in a raid on the great Bank of Mesa Verde. In the meantime, John has made contact with the revolutionaries and intends to use his dynamite in their service.—Anonymous In 1913 Mexico at the time of the Revolution. Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger), a Mexican outlaw leading a bandit family, flags down a large stagecoach wanting a ride. He forces the coach to stop where his family, consisting of his many sons and accomplices, rob the stagecoach. Juan chases down and rapes a woman from the coach who had insulted him upon his arrival as a ""peon"". Juan and his group strip the men of their clothing and leave them tumbling down a hill.Afterwords, Juan and his group hear explosions in the distance. Venturing to the source of the sounds, the Mexican bandit family meets John 'Sean' Mallory (James Coburn), an Irish Republican explosives expert on the run from the British. Noting his skill with explosives, Juan relentlessly tries to make him join them a raid on the Mesa Verde national bank. After John initially refuses, Juan frames him for the murder of his employer and several soldiers, making him a wanted criminal and offering to ""protect"" him in exchange for his help. John reluctantly agrees to help Juan rob the bank, but escapes on the way to Mesa Verde by climbing aboard a moving train.Arriving in the city before Juan, John makes contact with Mexican revolutionaries led by physician Dr. Villega (Romolo Valli) and agrees to use his explosives in their service. When Juan and his family arrive by train, John inducts him into the revolutionaries' ranks. The bank is hit as part of an orchestrated attack on the Mexican army. Juan, interested only in the bank's money, is shocked to find that it has no funds and is instead being used by the army as a political prison. John, Juan and his family end up freeing hundreds of prisoners, inadvertently (and against his wishes) causing Juan to become a ""great, grand, glorious hero of the revolution.""The revolutionaries are chased into the hills by a Mexican army detachment led by Colonel Günther Reza (Antoine Saint-John). John and Juan volunteer to stay behind with two machine guns and dynamite. Much of the army's detachment is destroyed while crossing a bridge which is machine gunned by them and blown to bits by John. Col. Reza who commands an armored car, survives.After the battle, John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan's family and children, have been killed by the army in a cave hideout. Engulfed with grief and rage, Juan goes out to fight the army single handed and is captured. John sneaks into camp where he witnesses executions of many of his fellow revolutionaries by firing squad. They had been informed on by Dr. Villega, who has been tortured by Col. Reza and his men. This evokes in John memories of a similar betrayal by Nolan (David Warbeck), his best friend, whom John kills for informing. Juan faces a firing squad of his own, but John arrives and blows up the squad and the wall with dynamite just in time. They escape on a motorcycle John is driving.John and Juan hide in the animal coach of a train. It stops to pick up the tyrannical Governor Don Jaime (Franco Graziosi), who is fleeing (with a small fortune) from the revolutionary forces belonging to Pancho Villa of the North and Emiliano Zapata of the South. As the train is ambushed by Mexican rebels, John, as a test of Juan's loyalty, lets him choose between shooting the Governor and accepting a bribe from him. Juan kills Jaime, and also steals the Governor's spoils. As the doors to the coach open, Juan is greeted by a large crowd and again unexpectedly hailed as a great hero of the revolution. He throws the money back into the coach to John.On a train with commanders of the revolution, John and Juan are joined by Dr. Villega, who has escaped. John alone knows of Villega's betrayal. They learn that Pancho Villa's forces will be delayed by 24 hours and that an army train carrying 1,000 soldiers and heavy weapons, led by Col. Reza, will be arriving in just three hours after dark, which will surely overpower the rebel position. John suggests they rig a locomotive with dynamite and send it head on. He requires one other man, but instead of picking Juan, who volunteers, he chooses Dr. Villega. It becomes clear to Villega that he knows of the betrayal. John nonetheless pleads with him to jump off the locomotive before it hits the army's train, but Villega feels guilty and stays on board. John jumps in time and the two trains collide, killing Villega and a number of soldiers.The revolutionaries' ambush is successful, but as John approaches to meet Juan, he is shot in the back by Col. Reza. An enraged Juan riddles the Colonel's body with a machine gun. As John lies dying, he continues to have memories of his best friend, Nolan, and a young woman both apparently loved. John recalls killing Nolan after being betrayed by him to the law. Juan kneels by his side to ask about Dr. Villega. John keeps the doctor's secret and tells Juan that he died a hero of the revolution. As Juan goes to seek help, John has a flashback to his time in Ireland with Nolan and a girl whom they both were in love with; knowing his end is near, sets off a second charge he secretly laid in case the battle went bad. The film ends with Juan staring at the burning remains, asking forlornly: ""What about me?"""

Doctors are being murdered in bizarre manners - bats, bees, a killer frog mask, etc. - which represent the nine Biblical plagues of Egypt. The crimes are orchestrated by an organ-playing, demented madman (from his home base, replete with a clockwork orchestra and help from a beautiful, mute assistant). Detectives are stumped until they find that all the slain doctors once assisted a Dr. Vesalius on an unsuccessful operation involving the wife of organist Dr. Phibes, killed in a car crash upon learning of his wife's death. He couldn't be the culprit, could he?—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> It isn't until there are a handful of victims that Detective Inspector Harry Trout with Scotland Yard believes there is a serial killer on the loose, all the victims physicians and all having been killed in some gruesome, seemingly ritualistic manner somewhere they would have considered safe. The one connection the victims has to each other is to another physician, Dr. Vesalius, who is further able to narrow down the connection to one case, that of Victoria Phibes, Vesalius the chief surgeon with Mrs. Phibes having died on the operating room table. Her body was subsequently interred next to her husband, musicologist Dr. Anton Phibes, who, in rushing to the hospital upon learning that his wife was there, died in a fiery car crash en route, his body incinerated on the spot. With further evidence coming to light, Trout and Vesalius believe that all on the medical team on that case, including Dr. Vesalius, will be targets of the killer, whose method of murder is each of the Ten Plagues of Egypt in some form, with Vesalius most likely the last in being ""the prize"". As Trout and Vesalius try to stop the killer in knowing the targets and the method of killing, they still have to discover who the killer is, one incredulous thought upon which they are working being that Dr. Phibes is somehow orchestrating it all from the grave.—Huggo Opening scene with credits.

The black figure descends the steps, cranks the wind-up musicians into life, which play a waltz.A door opens, and from a bright room beyond steps forth a young, fashionable woman wearing a white, gold-rimmed sheer dress with matching headdress. The woman in white and the figure in black meet in the room's center over a designed glass floor. As they dance to the grand waltz, they pass a table in the back holding nearly a dozen life-size busts in white wax with hanging lights above them.The woman climbs the stairs to the balcony that surrounds at least one wall of the room, while the figure in black steps to a large suspended birdcage on a gold chain with a black cloth cover. He lowers the cage through a square hole in the floor where the woman, now below and dressed in a modern Russian garb (tall bushy black fur hat with gray sheer sleeves), buckles the cage on the black of a prestigious car. The figure in black enters the car, rolling up the window with a man's profile painted on the glass.Scene change. The bedroom of a wealthy man reading in bed. He finishes, turns out the light, and turns over for sleep. Outside, the elegant car quietly comes to a stop. As the man sleeps, the skylight opens, the birdcage is lowered, and the black cover is hoisted up, soon followed by the cage itself, showing a bottom trapdoor swinging open. The skylight is closed.The man awakens, hearing disturbing little sounds about his room. He looks 'round, sees nothing but then hears little squeaks and flutters. Shadows flutter past. Suddenly there are bats on his bed climbing towards his face, screeching. The man is terrified.The car returns to the mansion. The clockwork musicians kick into gear, playing ""What Can I Say After I Say I'm Sorry?,"" with print upon the bass drum: ""Dr. Phibes Clockwork Wizards."" The figure in black enters the mansion while the woman closes up the car. The man in black switches off his musicians and sits at the organ, while the young woman appears on the balcony. As the man plays a contented tune on the organ, he and it sink back into the floor.Next morning, a butler approaches his master's bedroom, wheeling breakfast. He knocks, enters the room, and says ""good morning, sir"" (the first spoken words, ten minutes into the film). A bat lands on the breakfast plate. He looks about to see bats hanging all over the room, and his master dead, face slashed and riddled with blood. Horrified, he runs from the room.At the mansion, the dark figure hangs a pendant over one of the wax busts (matching the man just killed) and burns its face with fire.Back in the dead man's bedroom, Sgt. Tom Schenley, on ladder, removes a last bat from the skylight, while Police Inspector Trout pronounces it a strange business. Schenley recalls a similarly weird death involving another surgeon, stung by bees in his library, his face a mass of boils. Trout chides two officers about to carry the dead doctor out with his shredded face uncovered.At the mansion, two prosthetic ears and a nose sit on a dressing table. The formerly dark figure now dressed in white (face unseen), takes the nose, then the ears, then a light brown wig. The composed face of Dr. Anton Phibes is now seen (a colorful rendition of the black and white face painted on the car window. He sits at his organ with its red plastic panels, adjusts a few tabs, and begins to play. After a few measures, the organ and player begin to rise to the floor above.Party scene. Camera focuses closely on another pendant worn by Phibes, zooming out to see him in a tux and handing an elegant frog's head mask to Dr. Hargreaves, who didn't know the party was a masked affair. Phibes, masked as a bird of prey, speaks nary a word. Psychiatrist Dr. Hargreaves, introduces himself (""head shrinker,"" he chuckles) and asks for Phibes' help donning the mask with its fancy catch in back. Phibes obliges, which sets the mask's ever-tightening catch in motion. Phibes continues to be a dour, silent and watchful presence as Hargreaves joins the party. ""Darktown Strutters' Ball"" plays as the frog mask strangles the screaming doctor, who collapses and falls down a flight of stairs, blood squirting from the mouth of the frog mask.Back at the mansion and dressed in black, Phibes hangs his pendant over the next wax bust and blowtorches the face of Dr. Hargreaves, hot wax dripping on the pendant.At the police station, Chief Inspector Crow dismisses Trout's request for additional men to investigate the growing string of exotic doctor murders. Bat, bee and frog, indeed. The men are together only in not wanting the press involved. Crow declares there are very strange people practicing medicine these days.At the mansion, Phibes, with a cauldron boiling in the background, packs a medical bag.At the home of Dr. Longstreet, the doctor cuts a film reel from its wrapping. Mrs. Frawley, a housekeeper or companion of sorts, startles him by announcing her departure for an evening off, for which the doctor seems most eager.Phibes' car, with painted images of Phibes on the windows, pulls up outside.Dr. Longstreet runs his black and white film reel, gulping wine as he lusts over the image of a snake dancer. Mrs. Frawley's feet appearing below the screen interrupt his private enjoyment. She calls him naughty for not touching his supper yet. Asking about the screen blocking the doorway, Longstreet awkwardly explains it as a modern invention to block drafts. She leaves, dubious of his explanation.Shot of Phibes' car window (bearing Phibes' painted image).Back in Longstreet's study, the film reel leaves the spokes of the projector and its power cuts off. It starts up again to reveal Phibes' fashionable assistant dressed in white. Longstreet is absolutely transfixed. She stops him absent-mindedly cracking a lever in mid-air and seductively pushes him backwards into a chair, tying his wrists to it. Once secured, Phibes, dressed in black and wearing another pendant, switches on the room lights and enters, kneeling down to stare closely at Longstreet. The woman inserts a tube into a rubber-capped beaker as Phibes surgically cuts open Longstreet's sleeve before jabbing a needle into his arm. Longstreet struggles helplessly, managing only to tear the pendant from Phibe's neck.At police headquarters, Trout fumes before Sgt. Schenley over Crow's poo-pooing of the case. Schenley has successfully squashed interest of the press thus far, and has also turned up the fact that all three deceased doctors have worked with a Dr. Vesalius.Trout and Schenley visit the home of Dr. Vesalius, lead in by the doctor's teenage son. The boy is impressed that Det. Insp. Trout comes from Scotland Yard, but not the father, who busies himself with a model train set. Vesalius isn't fussed about the deaths of three doctors until Trout lists off their names (Hargreaves, Thornton and Dunwoody) - all close friends of Vesalius.Back in Longstreet's study, Phibes withdraws Longstreet's blood. As the sun rises, and the woman plays ""Close Your Eyes"" on her white violin, Phibes draws out every last drop. He packs up, leaving eight jars of Longstreet's bottled blood on the mantelpiece. He returns to take a second look at Longstreet's choice of art on the wall - a naked woman and naked child cleaving to a nude male wearing a red cape. Phibes gives Longstreet a last disapproving look and exits.Vesalius finds the death of his colleagues hard to believe. The phone rings for Trout, informing him of Longstreet's death, making it Vesalius' fourth colleague to have been murdered in an exotic manner.Questioning Mrs. Frawley, Trout finds her report of hearing a violin or cello at 2:30 AM astonishing and incredible, but Schenley's presentation of the broken pendant gives Trout a clue he can, at last, pursue.Back at the mansion and ready to burn another wax face, Phibes realizes his pendant is missing.Trout dismisses Mrs. Frawley. Trout and Schenley look at Longstreet, drained dry as a bone.Phibes torches Longstreet's wax image without pity.Visiting the goldsmith who made the pendant, Trout learns it's part of a set of ten, each unique and ordered by a lady who didn't talk much and paid in cash - tall, attractive, young and fashionable. As Insp. Pike - no, that's Trout - leaves, the goldsmith hastens him back to add that the pendant symbols are Hebrew, which noticeably perks up Trout's interest.Visiting a rabbi, Trout learns the Hebrew symbol is part of list of ten curses visited upon the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Starting with boils, bats, frogs and blood, the list continues with rats, hail, beasts, locusts, deaths of the first-born, and finally darkness ""to end forever the sleep of Man.""With incense burning in his hidden basement chamber, Phibes attaches a cable from a gold phonograph audio horn into the left side of his neck. He then speaks (first time in this film) to an enlarged photograph of a young woman, with his mouth never moving as he sits before her shrine expressing his love.Having gone over his medical history, Vesalius presents Trout his findings: He served 1200 medical cases. Discounting cases over five-years-old (due to Dr. Dunwoody's term of involvement), thirty-six cases involved any two of the four slain doctors, a scant dozen where any three were involved, but only one involving all four. Trout reads the file: Victoria Regina Phibes, whom the doctors were too late to help.Back in his basement sanctuary, Phibes tells the photograph that nine killed her, nine shall die - ""nine eternities in doom.""Trout continues going over the case file. Victoria died, and her husband Anton died in a fiery car crash, incinerated while racing back to be at her side, both now interred in the family vault. They were childless - so who's left to use the ancient plagues of Egypt to commit grizzly retributions?On a back road bordered by a calm river, the door to Phibes' car opens. The fashionable woman, dressed in black with a black fur hat, walks a Grayhound (seen nowhere else in the film). As a car approaches, the dog disappears and the woman peers into her car's engine. The man in the car, a gentleman, instructs his chauffeur to help the lady out. As the chauffeur greets the lady, Phibes' car door opens unnoticed. Straightaway, the chauffeur is rendered unconscious at a touch from Phibes. Phibes takes a lightweight machine from his vehicle, and the woman steps over the fallen chauffeur.Hearing ""Elmer's Tune"" playing outside his car, the slightly feeble gentleman tries looking out his window. The opposite door opens, and the woman places the moving music box figurine inside, soon followed by Phibes and his machine. The physical appearance of both Phibes and victim - jowly, mustached, side-burned, black suited, white dress shirted, gray-eyed - are similar, and they regard each other for a moment.Over coffee, the police discuss the remaining plagues and their placement of guards around all five surviving surgical team members, save Dr. Kitaj, whom they haven't yet located. The money from Phibes' Switzerland account was transferred to England two years ago and withdrawn in cash by a tall attractive woman who rarely spoke a word. Matching the goldsmith's description, Trout is keen upon meeting HER.At the mansion, the fashionable woman finishes sweeping as the clockwork pianist plays, and a recorded voice sings ""One for My Baby and One More for the Road.""It's night. The inspectors reach the muddy backroad where Dr. Hedgepath's car and unconscious chauffeur have been found. With difficulty, Trout opens the car door, frozen solid. Likewise Dr. Hedgepath inside. It's the curse of hail. The constable points out the lightweight machine, connected to the car's running engine to deliver a -100° blast of arctic hailBack at the wax busts, Phibes torches the likeness of Dr. Hedgepath, with its wax dripping on the pendant.At home, Dr. Vesalius plays chess with his son but his troubled mind is elsewhere, and he sends his son to bed. His son hopes to share a ""super"" music piece he's come across through Old Darrow at the music shop, who remembers all the great organists - Bridges, Drew and Phibes. Now Dad's interest is up, and he picks up the music score his son leaves behind.At the music shop, Vesalius picks through old posters to find one on Phibes, dated 1904, and tries to engage dotty, old Mr. Darrow in a conversation about him.Phibes plays ""War March of the Priests"" once again at his organ.Back home with Trout, Vesalius shares his experience of meeting Old Darrow, who can hardly see and seemed to insist that Phibes was still his patron. Trout now wants to visit the Phibes mausoleum.Trout and Vesalius enter a graveyard, with the attendant declaring under his breath that the worms will have these two fools soon enough. Trout reveals that Phibes had degrees in music and theology. Vesalius says it neatly explains Phibes' knowledge of the Egyptian plagues, which Trout hadn't yet connected.Back at the mansion, Phibes sits at his organ, his back to the room. The woman approaches him, dressed in orange and bearing flowers. She gives him the bouquet and he (and organ) descend.The graveyard attendant opens the Phibes mausoleum for Trout and Vesalius. Vesalius asks if anyone ever visits the place. The attendant says no but Trout spots a bouquet of roses on Victoria's burial vault, still with scent. The attendant swiftly but quietly slips away. Removing the vault and coffin lids reveals a small wooden box housing Anton Phibes' ashes. Dissatisfied, Trout speculates that the ashes of the incinerated car crash body might have been that of a chauffeur. Phibes may have survived and returned to London, which could explain Old Marrow thinking Phibes was still around. At Vesalius' suggestion they check out Victoria's body. Her coffin is surprisingly empty.Phibes, back at his wife's shrine, espouses words of love and devotion, promising that they'll soon hold their two precious hearts in single time.Daytime. Sgt. Schenley races along a rural road. Back at the police station, Trout confirms to Chief Inspector Crow that Schenley is heading to meet the elusive Dr. Kitaj. Superintendent Waverley blusters in, confronting Crow while dismissing Trout's presence, to impress everyone what a ticking political time bomb they're in (especially for himself), demanding everyone get out there and bring the affronting madman in.The fashionable lady, dressed again in her black garb with matching black fur hat, exits Phibes' parked car. Sgt. Schenley races past a few brick buildings. Phibes finally exits his car to join his aide and a telescope atop a hill.Dr. Kitaj drives up across open ground to the hanger of the London Aeroplane Club. A youngish man, he whistles as he meets up with Harry, his mechanic, then enters his plane. Sgt. Schenley closes in. Phibes, playing with a wild flower, grins for the first time while his aide plays her white violin and Kitaj's plane readies for takeoff. Schenley arrives just as the plane heads downfield. He racing to catch up, but the plane achieves liftoff. Phibes watches - cold, dour and waiting. Unable to do else, Schenley watches Kitaj's plane as well.With the plane well aloft, rats break out, apparently targeting Dr. Kitaj for meat. Both Schenley and Phibes watch the plane go out of control and - with Kitaj covered in rat bites - crash. Phibes swivels his telescope and applauds. He walks over to his aide and applauds her playing, too (""All I Do Is Dream of You"").Soon after, Trout berates Schenley for not driving faster. Schenley counters that he was at times going over ninety miles an hour and that the car he picked up at Scotland Yard was the fastest he could find and ""damn nearly exploded"" on the journey. With a couple oil seals broken, it's going to need service. Superintendent Waverley suddenly appears, loudly asking Pike - uh, Trout - why his car's been moved. Trout and Schenley both realize what trouble they're in but each refrain from offering details. After inquiries about the Phibes case (and getting Trout's name wrong again), Waverley drives off. Before Trout and Schenley can discuss anything further, Waverley's car can be heard giving up the ghost off camera.Dr. Phibes prepares for a romantic interlude with his aide, lowering a backdrop painting of elegant people at a party. A banner on another backdrop proclaims it Le Casino De Monte Carlo. A fixed spotlight illuminates the woman, dressed in pale blue and lavender, seated at the room's only table, with a rose adornment and a bottle of champagne chilling. Dr. Phibes approaches and pours them each a glass. They clink glasses, and Phibes drinks from the right side of his neck. Gulping sounds can be heard. The woman watches, sipping her own champagne as Phibes finishes. They return their empty glasses to the table, clasp hands and dance. He returns her to the table before the clinking clockwork musicians reach the end of their dreamy, romantic rendition of ""You Stepped Out of a Dream.""Schenley and Trout go over plans for the surviving surgical team members, placing guards around Dr. Vesalius and Nurse Allen while setting about taking Dr. Whitcombe off to the country for a few days.Scene jumps to a men's club where Trout and Schenley escort Dr. Whitcombe out. The doctor is irritable at being removed from his patients for too long a time, but recognizes the royal treatment he's getting from the police. As Schenley takes Whitcombe's leather duffel bag, he and Trout open the double doors, whereby a whooshing sound heralds the head of a brass unicorn piercing Whitcombe's torso and nailing him to a thick, free-standing wooden wall, instantly killing him.As the police unscrew Dr. Whitcombe and the unicorn head from the wall, an old gentleman loudly demands their consideration for quiet.Dr. Phibes puts another medallion around another wax bust before blowtorching its face. His aide, dressed in pink, moves elegantly about the room, catching Phibes' attention briefly.At Scotland Yard, Trout expresses incredulity over the unicorn head (its horn stained in blood) being cast in brass. Schenley adds that it appears to have been catapulted from across the street.Dr. Phibes sits at his organ, watching images of his deceased wife projected overhead. Soft organ music plays. (Supposedly he's playing, but his movements say he isn't.) Phibes, aided by his audio cable, speaks lovingly to his wife's image (taking a few lines from John Donne's poem ""The Good-Morrow""). He declares to his wife's image that his work will be finished in the next twenty-four hours, whereby he'll rejoin his her in her setting forever.At Scotland Yard, Waverley berates Crow for engaging seventy men in a search for a man who was once buried. Trout happens by, and Waverley berates them both for making no difference whatsoever in arriving ahead of a crime for a change. Trout excuses himself for the lavatory, which Waverley declares highly appropriate.Followed by his aide (wearing her black fur hat again), Phibes wheels a brass wheelbarrow filled with Brussels sprouts up a board over his steps to the balcony. His aide watches him, then turns to watch the film audience.In his laboratory, Phibes monitors the Brussels sprouts dropping through a large plastic tube into a large, bubbling cooking pot. The woman, now dressed in yellow with her hair done up, enters with a small amount of more Brussels sprouts in a small serving basket. Phibes picks through them, discarding some but adding others to his cooking pot. A large cylinder holds an agitated amount of clear green liquid derived from the cooking pot. Phibes discards more of his assistant's Brussels sprouts before holding one and nodding approvingly.It's evening, as Trout and Schenley pull up and enter a hospital. A policeman reports nothing to report.In the lab, Phibes checks his cooking efforts, dipping his gloved finger into the brew and then sipping it through his neck. Sip. Swallow. It's good.Checking his map of the hospital grounds, Trout expresses confidence in his security measures to keep Nurse Allen alive, loosing a little steam in saying that only by dropping in by balloon could Phibes thwart his efforts - realizing upon utterance that the inventive Phibes could do just that. Dr. Vesalius asks what if Phibes is already in the hospital. Trout hopes he is, because he'll never get back out.Nurse Allen meets them, asking Dr. Vesalius of his involvement with men taking over her life by disallowing her to leave the hospital. She's distressed over being forced to stay in a guarded room for the next twenty-four hours. They enter the elevator, where (to the audience) it seems Dr. Phibes, dressed as an orderly with his back to them, stands over two large metal containers. Vesalius and Allen remain quite, not wanting to share their discussion with a mere orderly. As they exit at the next floor, the orderly turns and it is, indeed, Dr. Phibes. Vesalius and Allen exit the elevator, whereby Dr. Vesalius resumes his explanation of protecting her from a madman wanting to kill her. Phibes steps to the frosted glass of the elevator door and shuts the inner gate to continue on up to the next floor.Shocked at the news, Nurse Allen doesn't know how she'll be about to sleep. Dr. Vesalius suggests she take a sleeping pill. Allen retorts with a disapproving goodnight, and the policeman standing guard locks her in her room.On the floor above, Phibes wheels his containers into an unused room directly over Nurse Allen's. He plugs in a lamp and unfurls a life-size cartoonish drawing of a naked woman.On a lower floor, Trout supposes Phibes will eventually be stopped by simple human error. Vesalius disagrees. Phibes has had years to hide and plot. If they can throw off his maniacal precision, they might have a chance of stopping him by his own inflexible standards.Phibes drops a drill point between the eyes of the cartoon woman laid upon the bare wooden floor and begins to drill by hand. Camera shot from Nurse Allen's room shows drill coming through ceiling. Phibes brushes wood chips aside to peer through hole and see Nurse Allen sleeping, a few fresh wood chips in her hair. His curse of the pharaohs pendant swings from his neck. He attaches a black rubber tube to his first canister and sticks the other, smaller, clear plastic end in the hole cut into the floor. (Violin music begins to play ""Charmaine."") Green Brussels sprout broth drips over and runs down Nurse Allen's white globe night table light. As Phibes' aim gets better, the slimy broth drizzles over Nurse Allen's hand and face. Camera shows the tube above running out of juice, and another shot of Nurse Allen, still asleep, shows her face entirely coated in green slime.Phibes removes the tube and gazes down, satisfied. He rises to lift the cover off the second canister, which contains rattling locusts. He attaches another black tube to this and to the hole in the floor. A perfect fit. A midsection of clear glass shows the insects marching down the tube with Phibes looking on, excited. He taps the glass to gets the last of the bugs down the tube.Trout and Vesalius sit below, pondering over the final three curses. It could be Vesalius' turn this night as well, but Dr. Vesalius believes Phibes is saving something for him for last. That should mean the mysterious curse of darkness. Trout wonders about the death of the first-born, which Vesalius says shouldn't affect him because his elder brother already died. A horrible thought strikes Trout: what about Dr. Vesalius' first-born (Lem). Alarmed, Trout sends Sgt. Schenley to take two cars to the Vesalius home along with the doctor and report back.A few floors up, Phibes pokes the last bug through the hole.At the Vesalius home, a camera pans the living room, catching a smiling photograph of young Lem in happier times. Dr. Vesalius paces the room while Sgt. Schenley stands in the doorway. The tone is somber. A reflection on the photograph shows Dr. Vesalius gazing at his son's face. He picks up the portrait to gaze at his son more closely while Schenley walks over to gauge Vesalius' state of mind. Schenley then heads out swiftly.At the back of the house, a patrolman reports the back door hanging off, the lock forced, and looks of a struggle upstairs. ""The lad's been taken all right."" Schenley heads back to join Trout, instructing the patrolman to stay with Dr. Vesalius. The patrolman looks sadly down at the son's model airplane he holds. ""Poor little devil.""Schenley, now back at the hospital, runs inside to report the boy's gone with no sign of Phibes. Trout decides to check on Nurse Allen before he and Schenley head off together for the Vesalius home. They enter the elevator.Trout knocks on the Nurse Allen's door, twice. No response either time. That's. not good, and he tells the guard to open it...slowly. Cautiously Trout and Schenley enter to find Nurse Allen's head reduced to a skull, devoid of flesh, picked clean by locusts still prodding about for scraps, a green juice stain on the pillow, and her dark gray hair robbed of color.Back at the mansion and wearing his greasy black robes, Phibes blowtorches the wax likeness of Nurse Allen.Trout and Schenley stand aghast over Nurse Allen.Phibes, at his wife's shrine once more (and changed into off-white robes), speaks of soon being with her in eternal paradise.At the Vesalius home, Trout tries to reassure Vesalius that the police are doing everything they can, and suggests a little brandy might help.Phibes, sitting angrily at his organ with his audio cable still in his neck, dials a phone mounted on his organ, his wife's photograph on the dial.Phone rings at the Vesalius home. Vesalius picks up.Phibes flips all his tabs and plays a bunch of held-down notes.""Who's there?!"" demands Vesalius.Sneering and angry, Phibes hangs up.Cut off, Vesalius hangs up and looks over to Trout. Trout, having watched, looks back to the brandy. The phone rings again. Trout looks to the extension near him, and Vesalius picks up immediately. Phibes speaks. ""Nine killed her, nine shall die."" As Vesalius asks the caller if he's Phibes, Trout picks up the extension and listens in. Vesalius tells Phibes he must see him. He tries to maintain composure but then loses it, demanding to know where his son is. Phibes responds by saying ""The organ plays till midnight, the large house in Muldeen Square, come alone."" Phibes hangs up. Vesalius does too. So does Trout.Vesalius announces he's going alone, hoping to trade is life for his son's, but Trout forbids it. The police will be with him, whether Vesalius likes it or not, sorry. Seeing no way out of it, Vesalius asks to make a quick phone call, which Trout allows, but it's a ruse. Vesalius uses the metallic phone to knock Trout unconscious. Vesalius apologizes and heads out.Back at the mansion ballroom, Phibes' assistant wears a garment of red and gold, including a headdress reminiscent of a sundew plant, with red extensions tipped with red jelly or gemstones. She stands with arms outstretched as Phibes rises up on his organ, red organ backing red dress. As the organ stops, she slowly descends the steps towards the golden gramophone horn below and turns it outward. (Phibes appears to be playing, but the music is foremost a guitar with cello and a pair of unified male and female singers.) A camera close-up of the woman's neck adornment shows it to resemble an assortment of writhing gold snakes.Outside, Vesalius arrives. The woman lets him in.Phibes, at his golden horn, plugs in. The two men meet for the first time across opposite ends of the designed glass floor with the burnt wax figures in the background. Phibes greets Vesalius graciously but announces that his son will die at midnight. Phibes will have killed nine times in his lifetime but asks Vesalius how many murders can be attributed to him. ""None,"" says Vesalius. ""I never killed your wife!"" ""No?"" questions Phibes, and declares he has no faith in doctors. For example, he himself was told by doctors, after his crash, that he would never speak again but were proved wrong by Phibes, using his own knowledge of music and acoustics to recreate his voice. Vesalius says he doesn't need reminding of Phibes' ingenuity and, stepping forward, re-demands to know the whereabouts of his son. Phibes steps forward as well, causing Vesalius to fearfully back away, and reveals that Vesalius will see his son under circumstances that may trigger memories.Lights in a room beneath the glass floor fade up. There rests Vesalius's son, unconscious, under a lavender covering that exposes only his face and center of his chest (and bare feet and arms, seen later on). The boy is restrained to a wheeled table by a metal neck brace, aluminum in appearance, that seems secured to the floor by chains. Vesalius touches the floor: so near and yet so far.Phibes gives the son (already anesthetized) the same chance at survival that his wife had under Vesalius' knife. ""You're wife, no, Phibes, but you I will kill."" ""You can't, doctor. I am already dead,"" says Phibes.The red-dressed assistant leads Vesalius through a hole in the floor down to the room below.Trout awakens in Vesalius' home, drinks the brandy then calls for the sergeant.Phibes unplugs his audio cable from the golden horn and plugs it into the floor along the framing of the glass design. He asks if Vesalius can hear him. In the makeshift surgical room below, Vesalius can. Phibes points out an x-ray of the son's rib cage, showing a tiny key lodged close to the boy's heart that will unlock the restraining halter around his neck. Phibes positions a contraption with a coiling tube to a round hole in the glass floor. Vesalius needs the key to unlock the halter and remove the boy from his fixed position, his face directly below the coil contraption. Acid will soon be released into the tube, where it will creep down and reach the outlet over the boy's face in exactly six minutes. Vesalius, with the woman's help, prepares for surgery. Phibes releases the red-colored acid and watches its progress in the tube. The woman puts a surgical on Vesalius, and he asks her to please hurry.Phibes continues watching the acid descend, almost playfully. Vesalius begins to cut into his son (not directly shown). Phibes leaves the acid contraption, unplugs his cable from the floor and descends into the surgical room.A car, presumably with Trout and police inside, hurries down an alley towards Phibes' mansion.Phibes enters the surgery room where Vesalius works diligently. ""For God's sake,"" utters Vesalius, at which Phibes proclaims to have God on his side. Better for Vesalius to put his faith in his own skilled hands, he says. Phibes directs Vesalius to look above at the acid heading for his son. Phibes turns to his fashionable assistant and addresses her by name for the first time. ""Vulnavia, my work is nearly finished. Go, now. Destroy all I have created."" She leaves and Phibes orders the doctor to work faster, enjoying the added, torturous pressure this puts on him. Phibes' wife only existed six minutes on Vesalius' operating table. Vesalius murdered her, but Phibes has given Vesalius ""a second chance"" (to redeem himself, supposedly) by saving his son in the same six-minute time frame.Upstairs, Vulnavia activates the clockwork musicians into playing ""A Hundred Years from Today."" She tarries at the acid machine (with the red liquid reaching all the way to floor level by now) then walks on to a gold-colored axe embedded in the dance floor.Downstairs, Phibes enjoys taunting Vesalius about not saving his son in time. The son will not only die but ""have a face like mine,"" he says. Vesalius looks up as Phibes tears off his prosthetics to reveal a horrific face, the eyes intact but the front barely covered by ruined flesh, teeth permanently exposed and fused together, and a skull mostly (top, back and sides) exposed. Vesalius turns back to his son, and Phibes slowly backs out of the room, exiting.Phibes walks through the ballroom as Vulnavia continues to hack at things (the wax busts, the canvas painting). Phibes sits at his organ as the clockwork musicians continue to play.Vesalius, still working, sweats.Vulnavia slashes the canvas painting, and now Phibes warms up the organ for one more performance of ""War March of the Priests.""Hearing this from below, Vesalius looks up. His son, still unconscious and oblivious to the horrors around him, lies peacefully.As Phibes plays, drowning out the clockwork musicians, he has a grand time, twice glancing back at Vulnavia's handiwork at the canvas.Vesalius looks up to see the acid beginning to fill a transparent lower dish above his son's head. Vulnavia continues to chop. Phibes and organ begin their descent.Trout, Schenley and several policemen pull up out front.As Vulnavia continues to chop, Trout and Schenley poke their heads through tears in the canvas, unaware their heads appear atop drawings of party-going bodies.Vesalius continues the surgery and sees, by the container above, that he has thirty seconds left. With the acid rising to the ends of tubes that will drip down at nearly half a dozen points over a small area, Vesalius finally extracts the key, but now his hands ARE shaking and he can barely fit the key in the lock. He does, however, and releases his son from his fixed position.Others enter. Trout and Schenley have cornered Vulnavia in the surgical room, with her threatening them with her axe. Unfortunately, she's forgotten about the acid that she now stands under. The acid (having turned a honey color) comes through the eighteen tubes. She screams (the first time in the film her voice is heard). Camera only shows the glass surgical table and chemical steam. She collapses and Trout looks away, sickened. Vesalius says they'll need an ambulance for them (Vulnavia and the son).Back in his private basement chamber, Phibes steadily recreates his face with prosthetics.Vesalius, joining Trout and Schenley, returns to the ballroom. Officers are dispatched to bring the boy up and prepare for the ambulance arrival. Wondering aloud where Phibes went, the organ almost silently rises from below, drawing their attention. The three men ascend the steps to it. Trout warns Vesalius against touching it himself as it may be a trap of some sort. Trout swats a tab nervously to see if there's a reaction.Below, Phibes, finished recreating his face, walks to the other side of the room and raises his right arm. As he unbuttons his sleeve, a light comes on, revealing his wife laid out. Phibes steps into this sunken bed of sorts, with a mirror angled to reflect her as if in a standing position. He lies next to her and jabs a hypodermic needle into his arm. A plastic tube shows blood taken from Phibes spurting out into the first of several empty beakers. Next to them are three beakers marked Embalming Fluid. As the blood flows into an empty beaker, yellow embalming fluid leaves the other. Dr. Phibes rests comfortably and seemingly goes unconscious. The camera moves to the mirror at their feet. It suddenly moves, revealing itself to be a lid with an outer relief design of the sun, Earth and moon, with the moon casting the Earth in a total eclipse.As the lid lowers automatically, Trout, Schenley and Vesalius lower downward on the organ, which grandly plays the conclusion of ""War March of the Priests"" on its own. Having reached Dr. Phibes inner sanctum, the men are confused. Where's Phibes? It's the final curse, darkness, which means to forever end the peaceful sleep of these three men. They turn to leave, and lights dim on Phibes' final resting place, leaving only the sun design illuminated. A thunderclap is heard (more for the sake of the viewing audience than the characters).End credits roll to the melody of ""Over the Rainbow."" As the song reaches it's trumpeted conclusion, the trumpet fails to finish, with the last note replaced unsatisfactorily by a piano. Phibes' wicked chuckle is heard, and the meaning is clear: Just as the song isn't really finished, neither is Dr. Phibes."

Conversely, Bob easily moves between Alex and Daniel, especially when he starts to feel penned in by one, or has an argument with one. Alex and Daniel, who give each other the space when with Bob, accept the situation if only to hold onto their small piece of Bob out of that love and a need to fill the void caused by other issues in their lives. Alex is at a crossroads professionally, she who is contemplating quitting her less than satisfying job, without a sense of what to do in its place. Although comfortable with his homosexual orientation when with his friends, Daniel, feeling generations of Jewish guilt, has not told his family, who still expect him someday to get married and have children, despite he being in middle age.

While Daniel spends the evening alone at his flat, gazing thoughtfully at the garden light-sculpture Bob has given him, the Hodsons depart and Alex and Bob play with the exuberant children.On Saturday afternoon when Bob indicates he would like to go into town, Alex immediately asks if he will be seeing Daniel, but Bob remains evasive and departs. A surprised Daniel welcomes Bob and the men spend the afternoon in bed together making love. Afterward, Bob examines his light-sculpture and confides that an art dealer in America is very interested in the piece. Aware of Bob's weekend plans, Daniel asks if Alex knows of Bob's visit, but the younger man responds equivocally. Bob then asks Daniel when they will take their long planned trip to Italy and Daniel assures him that he can go at the end of the month.At the Hodsons', precocious older daughter Lucy asks the grumpy Alex if she is overeating because Bob has left her.

Admitting she loves Bob, Alex nonetheless says she cannot abide his personal terms. Bob repeats that Alex demands too much of him and expresses regret at losing her. Feeling empathy with Daniel, Alex assures Bob she is not breaking with him over their relationship.That night, Daniel arrives home from the bar mitzvah to find Bob asleep in his bed. After the men make love, Daniel wonders if Bob will miss either him or Alex. Bob casually promises he will return.On Sunday, Bob departs for the U.S.A., leaving Daniel's flat key behind. Later when Alex goes to visit the Hodsons, she sees Daniel's car outside and waits for him to leave. The couple meet on the street and share a moment of embarrassed laughter and mutual commiseration over Bob's cavalier departure that morning. That afternoon Alex returns home to find Bob has left her his pet toucan.In the final scene, Daniel resumes his Italian language practice and reflects that although he is aware of Bob's profound inadequacies as an emotional partner, the men did share something of worth. In an unconventional monologue, Daniel muses on his relationship with Bob, his friends' concern for his happiness, and declares ""I am happy, apart from missing him."" His last remark is ""I only came about my cough,"" often a punch-line to a joke about a man going to the doctor and getting unexpected news."

In Victorian London, Dr. Henry Jekyll attempts to create an elixir of life using female hormones stolen from fresh corpses. He reasons that these hormones will wipe out all common diseases and extend his life since women live much longer than men. However, once Dr. Jekyll drinks the serum himself, he transforms into a gorgeous but evil woman. He soon needs female hormones for his serum to maintain, so a number of London women meet bloody deaths.—Marty McKee <mmckee@wkio.com> Dr. Jekyll is a scientist researching the cure of many diseases. He is a very reserved and shy man, and spends most of his time working on his laboratory. One day, his friend Professor Robertson visits him and advises that he would probably die before the conclusion of his studies. Dr. Jekyll decides to research an elixir of life, based on feminine hormones, to extend his life and consequently end his work. He uses female corpses to get the hormones. The effect of the elixir releases his '""feminine repressed side"" and he becomes an aggressive and beautiful woman, Ms. Hyde. When the bodies finish in the city morgue, Dr. Jekyll starts killing women to proceed with his research.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In Victorian London, the police are looking for an unknown man wearing a top hat and dark cloak as the perpetrator of what have been coined the Whitechapel Murders, the victims knifed to death being young women of ill-repute. Concurrently, research scientist Dr. Henry Jekyll feels compelled to document anecdotally his latest research in case something happens to him. A virologist working on an antidote to cure a number of viruses, he decides to change his field of research on an off the cuff comment by friend and mentor, Professor Robertson, saying that such a cure-all would take years to develop, longer than Dr. Jekyll's lifespan. So Jekyll changes his research to finding the answer to eternal life so that he can live long enough to cure the world of its viruses. In early experiments, he narrows his research to the differences between the sexes and that females have a longer lifespan than males, early experiments on insects increasing that lifespan of males by a factor of three. The two problems are: he needing female organs to advance his research to humans, and exhausting the supply of deceased females in morgues, he turns to killing himself for the greater good, hence he being the Whitechapel Murderer; and that he has no human subject, so uses himself as that subject. With that latter issue, he discovers that his use of the serum changes his being to a female, who he is passing off as his widowed sister, Mrs. Hyde. That transformation initially helps his cause as Mrs. Hyde takes over the murders. But as the Spencers, who live above him, become more ensconced in his life - Howard Spencer who is attracted to Mrs. Hyde, and innocent Susan Spencer having long pined for Dr. Jekyll - things become more complex as Dr. Jekyll and cold-blooded Mrs. Hyde battle for control of his being, Mrs. Hyde who could choose Susan as her next victim.—Huggo In Victorian London, a series of prostitute murders are being committed, and the police are hunting for an unknown killer wearing a black cloak and top hat, Dr. Henry Jekyll is hard at work on his laboratory where he attempts to create an elixir of life using female hormones provided from fresh corpses, provided to him by two grave robbers, William Burke and William Hare. He deduces that these particular hormones will annihilate many common diseases and is the key to prolonging his life since women live much longer than men. Dr. Jekyll tests the serum himself, transforming into a beautiful but evil, murderous, and sadistic woman named Mrs. Hyde. Unfortunately, he realizes that he needs female hormones for his serum to maintain this persona, but soon, Mrs. Hyde wants to be free of Dr. Jekyll and resumes killing. Dr. Jekyll attempts to stop Mrs. Hyde before his ""secret"" is exposed.—charmardee-smith"

The next day, Peter's brother Modeste (Kenneth Collen) arrives and warns him to protect his reputation or if news ever came out that Peter is a homosexual, the music Peter composes will never get played. Although colleagues gossip about Peter's relationship with his copyist Alexei (Bruce Robinson) and other male admirers, he retains the loyalty of Rubenstein, the head of the school.During a preview in which he performs his new piano concerto at the conservatory, Peter captivates his audience with his artistry and musical ideas. Among the listeners are the enraptured student Nina Milyukova (Glenda Jackson) and the wealthy and reclusive, middle-aged widow Madame von Meck (Izabella Telezynska), neither of whom he has met; and his unusually close sister, Sasha Davidova (Sabina Maydelle). As Peter plays, he envisions an idyllic summertime with family and friends. Nina daydreams that a barouche ferries her and an army officer to their wedding. Sasha feels transported to a woods where she and Peter dance and kiss, until his attention is diverted by Anton, who, in the auditorium, meets Peter's eye as the piece closes.Afterward, at the lively Rubenstein mansion where he resides, Peter inadvertently walks in on a woman singing in her bath. The sight of her recalls painful memories of how his mother died from the ""hot bath cure"" prescribed by her physicians for treating cholera. Reliving the trauma, he screams, frightening the woman and causing a scene, and later is consoled by Sasha.Meanwhile, through Rubenstein, von Meck offers to provide Peter with an income and house, but stipulates that she does not wish to meet him in person. After Peter writes von Meck a beautiful letter of thanks, they commence an exchange of letters, sharing their ideas about music. While never meeting face-to-face, their relationship becomes emotionally satisfying for both of them and when Peter sends her copies of the music he has written, von Meck claims it is ""real love.""Meanwhile, Nina writes love letters to Peter, in which she admires his music, and secretly describes fantasies in which he saves her from her abusive lover. Her letters resonate with Peter, who is working on his opera Eugene Onegin, in which a woman writes a letter to the hero. Claiming he wants to avoid the fate of the hero, who rejects the woman's love, Peter begins a hasty courtship and soon marries Nina in the spring of 1877 against the advice of everyone close to him. Warning that not all women are satisfied with spiritual relationships, Anton begs Peter to accept what he is. Upon hearing the news, Sasha cries, and von Meck, also upset, predicts that Nina will ruin Peter.On their honeymoon in St. Petersburg, Peter is unable to make love to Nina, who agrees to be patient with him. Grateful, Peter tells her cryptically that there are things in his past she may not understand, but that he believes he can live a ""normal, good life.""At an outdoor performance of Peter's ballet Swan Lake, Anton joins the couple, despite Peter's disapproval, and nudges Nina, who is ignorant of their past, into revealing her naïveté about Peter's life and music. After the performance, Peter dissuades Anton from remaining with them, but soon he and Nina are bored of walking and shopping, and begin to quarrel. When he suggests that they return to Moscow, she anticipates a romantic train ride in a private cabin, but instead, they get drunk and, to his horror, she tries aggressively to seduce him.At home, Nina's constant presence annoys Peter and he confides in a letter to von Meck that ""the only good part of him has perished forever."" When Nina's conniving mother (Maureen Pryor) arrives unannounced, Nina tries to send her away, but Peter invites her to stay and offers to sleep on the couch, allowing the women to share the one bedroom. To von Meck, he claims that his marriage is a ""dreary, unbearable comedy,"" but he cannot find fault with Nina, who loves him and yet is repulsive to him.Confused by Peter's rejection, Nina fights her growing panic over losing her husband. Anton tries to ingratiate himself with them by taking Nina's mother to the opera, leaving Nina alone with Peter. Toasting their ""sad, pathetic marriage,"" Peter asks forgiveness for marrying her, saying that she wanted a husband and he wanted marriage without a wife. Claiming that he cannot change and that everyone warned him against marrying her, Peter reminds Nina that Rubenstein tried to bribe her into quitting the marriage. Disturbed, she scratches at the floor with her hands as she talks and then, in desperation, tries to tear off their clothes and kiss Peter. In their struggle, she scratches Peter, who runs from the house to the cold river, where he attempts to drown himself, but refrains when a woman dressed in white walks by. When Peter returns home, he tries to choke Nina, but Alexei intervenes.Later, Rubenstein tells von Meck that a doctor ordered Peter to spend time away from Nina. Von Meck, increasingly infatuated with Peter, offers to let him live in a lodge on one of her country estates. When Peter moves into the lodge, Modeste and Alexei accompany him, although Alexei is ashamed of Peter's treatment of Nina. Von Meck moves into the country manor on the estate but remains connected to Peter only through their letters, which become more passionate and, for von Meck, erotic.Wanting to share more with Peter, yet maintain privacy, von Meck writes him to visit her house while she is away. Peter sits in her rooms, smokes and eats fresh fruit, and when she returns after he is gone, she eats from his leftover fruit and imagines she is lying chastely on a daybed beside him.Still not comprehending Peter's sexual orientation and burdened by her mother's presence, Nina believes she can get her husband to return by making him jealous. Taking advantage of Nina's mental fragility, her mother procures men who pay to have sex with her daughter, introducing them as famous composers. Nina's sanity collapses into nymphomania and she becomes pregnant.For Peter's birthday, von Meck throws an elaborate party in his honor in the gardens of the estate, and watches from a distance. Anton attends and tries to resume his relationship with Peter, but, deceiving himself, Peter claims he is ""a respectable married man."" Spurned by Peter, Anton has a private audience with von Meck. As Peter cavorts with young boys on the grounds below, von Meck becomes infuriated at the information Anton shares with her (implying that he tells her that Peter is homosexual).When Nina's child dies at birth, Nina's mother sends for Sasha and, hoping to extract money from her, tells Sasha that her daughter needs special care. After seeing Nina, Sasha urges Peter not to abandon his wife and Peter claims he is helping financially as much as he can, but that he can never return to her.Upon arriving at the lodge with his companions after visiting Sasha, Peter finds the grounds around the building on fire and discovers a letter from von Meck attached to the door, which is chained shut. In the letter Peter is told that his allowance has been stopped and the estate put up for sale.At Modeste's suggestion, Peter begins conducting to earn a living and over the next few years becomes successful to earn his own house and wealth. Modeste and Alexei remain with him, but Sasha refuses to see him. In his loneliness, Peter tells himself that he really loved Nina. Although Nina's mother claims that her daughter is well cared for, she spends Nina's money on herself and places Nina in an asylum. There, Nina pretends that the inmates are her many lovers and that Peter loved her. However, even in dementia she realizes the truth and screams out, ""He hated me!"" thrashing about until the attendants restrain her.Later in 1893, a cholera epidemic reminds Peter of his mother's death and Modeste suggests that the new symphony Peter has finished is so sad that it should be called ""pathetic."" As he and Modeste dine, Peter intentionally drinks water contaminated with cholera and becomes ill. In his consequent delirium, Peter cries that he tried to love Nina, but at last claims, ""I cared for nobody."" As a last resort, his doctor prescribes the hot water treatment that killed Peter's mother. After Peter dies from the treatment, Nina remains in the sanitarium, permanently imprisoned by her madness."

Some of My Best Friends Are...,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067771/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dramatic expose of the lives of a group of gays who meet in a New York City bar on Christmas Eve. It's Christmas Eve at the Blue Jay, a Greenwich Village gay bar, a place where patrons believe they can feel free to be themselves as opposed to the straight charade many portray in their outside lives. To be more accurate, they can portray what they truly want to portray, talk to others in as open an manner as they want about their struggles in being gay, and can strive toward, or at least fantasize openly about, their dreams. As stated by Sadie Holzer, the bar's cook who just returned to work after a medical issue, those at the Blue Jay are like one big family of one's own choosing. She is only partially correct: they have all chosen the Blue Jay as their home, but there are some family members who some wish would just go away. One of those is Lita Joyce, who is outwardly a fag hag, but is really just a ball-buster who wants to prove to herself that she has what attracting the opposite sex takes. She brought Scott, a pilot, into the bar one evening, and Scott immediately fell for regular Terry, a graphic artist, and Lita seems determined to destroy their happiness. Another is Jim Paine, whom middle-aged Marvin Hocker tries unsuccessfully to pass off as his nephew; the two are planning to travel to Rome for the holidays, with everyone knowing Jim is a gay-for-pay hustler and Marvin his latest sugar daddy. As many men hope that tonight will be a special night in achieving their dreams--or at least one dream within many--they must face the reality that there will be an end to the evening and an outside world to which they will return.—Huggo It's Christmas Eve 1971 in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, and the regulars of the local gay bar ""The Blue Jay"" are celebrating. Not much has changed since the Stonewall riots, and while the situation is not yet ""peace on Earth, good will toward men,"" the times they are a-changin'.—Havan Ironoak <Havan_Ironoak@bigfoot.com> The lives and dramas of the clientele and staff at the Bluejar bar in Manhattan intersect on Christmas Eve 1971. The bar is run by Louis Barone, a small-time mafiosa who pays bribes to corrupt cop Pete Thomas so the bar doesn't get raided. Barone also lends money, with extorionate interest rates to patrons, including the extremely camp Kenny. Barone is straight and doesn't mind gay guys, apart from Leo, an Italian bisexual actor who can't keep away from the bar even when he has a woman in his bed. Barone feels that Leo reflects badly on Italians. During the film Leo befriends and then picks up a handsome young newbie from Nebraska, and they leave together at the end, Leo seeming to have made a choice.Two colourful women work at the bar: Sadie who has recently recovered from an operation, and towards the end of the film makes a speech where she calls the patrons of the bar her family. Helen acts as a motherly figure to the men, as well as entertaining them by singing Frankie and Johnny.A number of storylines involving different groups of characters develop as the film goes on.Lita Joyce is a 'fruit fly', an insecure woman who hangs around gay men because they are not sexually threatening. She is jealous of pilot Scott's relationship with artist Terry Nabour. In an early scene, Terry tells a story about how his prudish mother was shocked when she visited him at his studio when he was photographing a nearly-naked woman. Lita Joyce telephones Mrs Nabour and ""outs"" Terry to her. At the end of the film Mrs Nabour arrives at the bar and disowns Terry publicy. Terry is devastated but embraces Scott. Lita Joyce, on seeing the effect of her phone call, looks unhappy and leaves.Michel is a French ski instructor, recovering from a skiing accident, and in love with older married man, Barratt Arden. At the start of the film, Barratt has cut his hand on a glass when attempting to snatch away a matchbox with the Bluejay's name on it, so it can't be seen by his female friend. Michel spends the film trying to convince Barratt to leave his wife and be with him. Barratt refuses and leaves the bar, but returns at the end to be reunited with Michel, who is drunk and passed out.Marvin Hocker is an older man who is taking his ""nephew"" Jim on a holiday to Europe. Jim is a hustler who gets drunker as the film goes on, and eventually gets stoned. Hallucinating, he asks Karen, a lonely young woman who acts like a 1930s movie star for a dance. Karen fantasises that everyone thinks she is beautiful, but in reality she is handled roughly by Jim during the dance. As he gropes her he discovers that she is actually a man, and then he violently assaults her. The cop Pete Thomas wants to arrest Jim, but Marvin pays him off. Jim leaves on his own, having stolen the plane tickets.Karen, now out of drag, is called Harry. He is consoled by religious Howard, who plucks up the courage to invite Harry home. Harry suddenly asks the time and then leaves when he finds out it is two in the morning. At the end of the film, we see Harry/Karen being dominated outside the bar by the hypocritical cop Pete Thomas who is in a sexual relationship with him.
Comic relief in the film is provided by Miss Untouchable, who arrives in a cape and never speaks, and the Perfume Queen who has arranged a date with a straight man he's been dating via telephone, who thinks she's a woman. Another character called Giggling Gertie is a middle-aged man who screams with laughter at everything."

The Horsemen,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067216/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Drama depicting rural life in contemporary Afghanistan and the Afghani people's love for an ancient traditional sport similar to horseback polo. In the poor, desolate northern provinces of the mountainous feudal Sunni kingdom of Afghanistan (before the Soviet-engineered republican revolutions), the status of the proud men and their clans is determined less by wealth or even military power (both rare) then by victories in the ancient, though game of buskashi, a vicious form of polo dating back to Genghis Khan, in which the chapendaz (participating horsemen) use their horse-whips on both mounts and rivals in a ruthless fight for a heavy 'ball', a dead calf, which must be carried a long way, almost impossible with all the others mercilessly assailing. Tursen, a former champion, now holds the status of village notable thanks to his position as stable-keeper of the regional lord Osman Bey, and has finally bred a horse without equal, the white stallion Jahil, in time for the royal tournament on the plain of Bagrami, just outside the capital Kabul. As Tursen is too old and has a crooked leg, his son Uraz, even prouder and with a morbidly self-destructive need to prove himself against desperate odds, represents their stable, and after defeating every local adversary it's time to try his luck in Kabul, with a powerful incentive: after victory, he may keep the triumphant horse they cherish above life itself. It's a terribly long, dangerous road across the unforgiving Hindu Kush mountains, and despite a valiant fight Uraz looses the prize and has his leg badly fractured, but decides stubbornly to return home without healing in hospital, so gangrene sets in. His servant, the humble-born groom Mokkhi, is only persuaded to join the quasi-suicidal journey as Jahil is promised to him, but the valuable horse in equally desired by the cheap 'unclean' nomad Zareh whose female charms tempt the men, a deadly combination in itself...—KGF Vissers The film is based on Joseph Kessel's 1967 novel, ""Les Cavaliers"" (""The Horsemen""). Kessel spent almost fifty years of his life roaming the world, and he was the witness or a protagonist in several of the great world events, which took place during that time. Kessel was, in the tradition of Saint-Exupery, Malraux, Pierre Mac Orlan, and Hemingway, an adventurer, journalist, globetrotter, and great writer, a man who tried to make the novel ""the privileged expression of the experienced adventure."" In 1967, on returning from Afghanistan where he had been on a mission for the World Health Organization, he wrote Les Cavaliers, which is dedicated to the Afghan horsemen of the steppes of Central Asia, exalting their wonderful and savage freedom in the game of ""buzkashi.""The buzkashiThe Afghan national game of ""buzkashi"" dates back to the time of Genghis Khan. It is a fierce competition, played on the steppes of the northern provinces of Maimana, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Kataghan by expert horsemen called ""chapendaz.""The game is played on horseback. Two types of indigenous Afghan horses, known for their strength and endurance, are used. Each horse is one with its rider: should he dismount or be thrown, the horse will stand and defend him against the other chapendaz venturing too close. In the melee, at the games onset, or when the ball is dropped to the ground and the horsemen are competing to grab and carry it further, the horses will help their riders by kicking and biting the opponents. The horses are rumored to enjoy the game as much as the riders.The ball, called the ""buz,"" is a beheaded calf, its four legs cut off at the knees, its insides emptied. The buz is then soaked in water for 24 hours before the game, so that it may be tough enough for the horsemen to handle. Sometimes, sand is packed inside for extra bulk. A goat may also be used if there is no calf available.The chapendaz are master horsemen who have undergone arduous training. They wear thick hats (traditionally made of fox or wolf skins), quilted jackets, high, stiff leather boots, and they wind strong scarves around their waists. They carry short whips made of a handle attached to a foot-long piece of braided leather.The rules of the game are simple. The headless carcass is placed on the ground in the center of a circle (the ""hallal"" or circle of justice in Turkomen). The players may consist of opposing teams, or of individuals playing singly. The riders surround the hallal, trying to grab the buz, after which they bring it to the scoring area. In order to reach this goal, anything goes. The chapendaz not only whip their horses, but the other riders, and especially the one who has the buz. In the past, the chapendaz carried chains and even knives, and sometimes stabbed an opponents horse or even its rider, in an attempt to steal the buz. These practices are now forbidden now that we are civilized. Broken limbs frequently occur, but those do not stop the game, and the bandaged chapendaz is soon back in the saddle.There are two types of buzkashi. The first is the ""tudabarai,"" where in order to score, the rider must obtain possession of the buz and carry it away in any direction. The rider must stay free and clear of the other riders. In the second type, the ""Qarajai,"" the rider must carry the buz around two poles placed approximately one mile apart, and bring it back to the hallal. In this film, both types of buzkashi are shown.Afghans remember the stories of famous horses, horsemen and the great battles in which they displayed their skill and courage. To many Afghans, the buzkashi is not a game, it is a way of life, and a chapendaz is regarded as an honored member of the society.The FilmThe action takes place on the vast plains around Maimana in the northwest of the country, across the forbidding Hindu Kush, and in Kabul. Although the scenery and characters are timeless, the sight of a high-flying jet during a scene subtly establishes the movie's time period. The drama revolves around the ""mad horse,"" Jahil, with its almost human presence.The film opens with the movie credits rolling over the spectacular vista of the string of lapis lazuli blue lakes of Band-i-Amir. These lakes, a marvel of nature, are located at an altitude of seven thousand feet in the midst of a desert in Central Afghanistan.In the first scene, near the northern town of Maimana, we find Uraz (Omar Sharif) watching two Bactrian camels fight to the death in an enclosure. A crowd of excited aficionados and gamblers watches the duel's progress. Most Afghans are inveterate gamblers, betting on the outcomes of every type of arranged combats between animals: rams, dogs, partridges, crickets, you name it. They'll even bet on eggs (but this is not the place to explain how this works). A mysterious and likable character, Hayatal (Peter Jeffrey) appears next to Uraz and challenges him to bet on the outcome of the camel fight. An important trait of Urazs character is revealed as he permits the stranger to choose first. Obviously, Uraz cares more about the competition of betting than he does about winning. Before the camel fight ends, Uraz is summoned by his father, Tursen (Jack Palance), so he pays off Hayatal without waiting for the finish. Any other person interested in financial gain may have found this summons a good excuse for not paying, since Uraz's choice was obviously going to lose the fight. Earlier, when Hayatal asked an old lady in the bazaar about Uraz, she said, ""If you wager him for glory, you will lose. If for money, you will win.""In the village, Uraz meets his father, manager of the stables of the honorable Ozman Bay, a wealthy local land owner. Uraz is to ride Jahil, Tursen's latest prized white stallion, in the great buzkashi of the King, to be held in Kabul. If Uraz wins, Jahil is his to keep. How can he not win? ""If you cannot win on Jahil, you cannot win on any horse,"" says Tursen sarcastically. Uraz, like his father before him, is now the most famous chapendaz in the ""three provinces."" Nevertheless, his quest for glory seems endless, as an inner demon keeps driving him to surpass both his father and himself.At the buzkashi in Kabul, Uraz will know defeat. He not only loses the game, but his leg is fractured. His life lesson about pain and hate begins as he returns to Maimana, vanquished, prouder, more resolute, and crazier than ever.Uraz has the choice of two roads to return to Maimana: the relatively easy road across the terrible Hindu Kush Range, through the Salang Pass, the world's highest pass at ten thousand feet, or the dreadful ""ancient road,"" running through the Unai and Hajikak passes, both also near ten thousand feet, Bamiyan, followed by more high passes, before finally arriving on the northern steppes. Of course, Uraz chooses the ""ancient road,"" challenging himself to the limit, in order to redeem himself in his own eyes, and also those of his father. For all his toughness, his father had never traveled that road.As if the ""ancient road"" were not challenge enough, Uraz, whose fractured leg is fast becoming gangrenous, tempts his ""sais"" (groom), Mokkhi (David de Keyser), with a pact that involves ownership of the magnificent Jahil.Along the way, they meet a beautiful ""untouchable,"" Zareh (Leigh Taylor-Young). For her, it is love at first sight with the horse. She tags along the group in their journey to the north, determined to somehow take possession of Jahil. During this infernal trip, Mukkhi meets with love in the arms of Zareh, but also experiences greed, a taste for murder, and a pitiful downfall. Zareh, as beautiful as she is devious, inspires Mokkhi to murder and destruction. She is herself tormented by ""the horse"": ""Do you know, great Prince (Uraz), what brought me to you that first night? It was the horse."" Along this endless ""ancient road,"" the trio each confronts the worst in themselves, and arrive at their destination perverted and lost.Following a hellish snow storm, Uraz is separated from his two companions. Totally unconscious, he is still riding Jahil who takes him to the safety of a shepherds camp. Uraz wakes up in the presence of Mizrar (George Murcell), the chief shepherd of the local lord, who tells him that ""It must come off, son of Tursen."" And Mizrar amputates the rotten leg, as he would have done to one of his sheep.Eventually, Uraz returns to his home. There is a poignant exchange between father and son, following which the judgment of Mukkih and of Zareh, who had been captured by Tursen's men, is pronounced by Uraz, and Tursen further humiliates Uraz, in a final twist involving Jahil, the horse.Finally, a great feast is given to honor the victory of Urazs team at the buzkashi of the King, won by his teammate Salih. Uraz appears unannounced on horseback at the celebration and give a virtuoso demonstrates of his horsemanship before the assembly. The next day, he and his new traveling companion, Hayatal, leave for an endless journey across the steppes, in search of glory in more buzkashi competitions. Uraz says, ""The journey is from nowhere to nowhere. It suits me."""

When a trio of ex-convicts led by Mattie Appleyard is released from prison, they hope to open a general store using money Mattie has saved during his 40-year sentence. This attempt is met with great resistance from a corrupt prison official and the banker who issued Mattie the check.—Greg Helton <ghelton@airmail.net> In 1935 a trio of convicts, murderer Mattie Appleyard (James Stewart), bank robber Lee Cottrill (Strother Martin), and young Johnny Jesus (Kurt Russell), are released from a West Virginia prison. They intend to open a general store with a check for over $25,000 that Mattie has been issued for his 40 years of prison work. Unfortunately, prison captain ""Doc"" Council (George Kennedy) is plotting with local banker Homer Grindstaff (David Huddleston) to ensure the ex-convicts are never able to cash the check. Council arranges for the ex-cons to be killed at a railroad stop, but the ex-cons are told about the plot and thwart it. Council's men kill another passenger, and frame Mattie for the killing. Mattie takes a supply of dynamite from the dead man, and uses it to force Grindstaff into cashing his check. The ex-cons split up with the intention of later reuniting, as they try to stay one step ahead of Council. They must also deal with a down-on-her-luck prostitute named Cleo (Anne Baxter) who wants the money as well.—Patrick Depew Homer Grindstaff is a big named banker in Glory and Doc Council is a prison official and they team up to plot to kill Appleyard and his ex-convict friends who were attempting to open up a general store in Stone Coal, West Virginia and then to take the money.After the three ex-cons boarded a B&O passenger train headed for Stone Coal, Council teams up with Steve Mystic and Junior Kilfong to stop the train before it reaches its destination and kill all three convicts. After an unsuccessful attempt, Junior Kilfong fires one shot from his double barrelled shotgun into Roy K. Sizemore knocking him to the ground. After Appleyard, Johnny, and Cottrill depart on another train, Council identifies Sizemore as being an innocent bystander and shoots Sizemore in the head with a revolver, making the remark ""Looks like Appleyard's a murderer again,"" meaning that Appleyard was going to be setup to be either arrested or shot on site for the murder of a salesman. But not before Appleyard retrieved the salesman's goods (one suitcase full of dynamite). Hence the alternative name of the film ""Dynamite Man from Glory Jail.""The next morning, Appleyard enters the ""Bank of Glory"" which after a brief verbal altercation with a now stunned Grindstaff, and Council, lights the dynamite that is now strapped around his chest from . After Grindstaff pays Appleyard, the convicts head down to the train depot to catch a freight train out of Glory. Johnny and Lee meet up with Chanty, a shy 16 year old riverboat ""working girl"" played and Sonny Boy. After Lee agrees to get himself a drink of whiskey, Johnny stays on the river bank to wait for Appleyard). On the riverboat, Lee encounters Cleo. After Cleo realizes who was going to meet Lee on the riverboat, and hearing about the large amount of money that Appleyard has, she lures them all on the boat and takes the case, not knowing that the money is actually on Appleyard's person now and all that the case contains is the remainder of the dynamite. During this time, Johnny encounters Chanty, and fall in love instantly. The three take Chanty off the boat with them. After Cleo attempts to shoot the case, the case blows the riverboat up in pieces.After a sighting by Council on a box car freight train at the depot, Council pursues Appleyard and his gang, but not after being picked up by the train conductor to be transported out into the wooded area of now Marshall County, West Virginia. After eluding Council, Steve and Junior, Appleyard and gang end up at an abandoned house. Council, scaling the hillsides of Marshall County observes what is smoke from a chimney from afar. Knowing that he would now have to split the profit between Steve and Junior, he guns down both Steve and Junior on a Marshall County hillside and makes his way to the abandoned house.Once at the abandoned house, Appleyard knows something is not right. He can sense the presence of someone. After Johnny and Chanty are awakened by something outside, Johnny runs upstairs to warn Appleyard and Cottrill. When doing so, Council fires a shotgun round through an upstairs window, striking the window sending glass and debris onto Appleyard, injuring him. Knowing that Appleyard had dynamite on him, Johnny and Lee prepare to throw dynamite at Council in the attempt to kill him. When doing so, Council's dog, Joey, picks up the lighted stick of dynamite and carries it back upstairs. At this time, the dog drops the dynamite, only for Appleyard to pick it up and throw it out the window, only this time, the dynamite laying next to Council. The dynamite exploded and thus killed Council.The next scene shows Appleyard, Johnny, Lee, and Chanty inside the Marshall County Court House, being escorted outside by Police. With Grindstaff looking from his bank office window, which was located next to the Marshall County Court House, the Prosecuting Attorney enters with Appleyard.

He was told ""Anywhere from Wheeling to Stone Coal"". Knowing his misfortune, Appleyard walks up to the teller and asks to cash his check. After the crowd cheers outside the bank, they depart for the train station.While onboard, Appleyard was warned by ""Tighe"" (the glass eye) that something was about to happen. The train conductor who had helped Appleyard elude Council pulled the emergency stop on the train and stated that they were being followed. While the three ex-cons and Chanty exited the train, it was Council's dog who had been friends with Johnny all through his prison sentence who had been following the train, barking. After the dog is hugged by Johnny, they all get back on the train, and head away in the distance."

200 Motels,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066732/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The great Frank Zappa's outrageous psychedelic precursor to today's music videos features ""The Mothers of Invention"" wreaking havoc in a typical American town. Ringo Starr narrates. ""Touring makes you crazy"", Frank Zappa says, explaining that the idea for this movie came to him while the Mothers of Invention were touring. The story, interspersed with performances by the Mothers and the Royal Symphony Orchestra, is a tale of life on the road. The band members' main concerns are the search for groupies and the desire to get paid.—George S. Davis As Larry the Dwarf (Ringo Starr) descends onto a television soundstage carrying a steaming genie lamp, the German announcer (Theodore Bikel) asks him why he is dressed as Frank Zappa, the leader of the music group The Mothers of Invention. Larry responds that Frank forces him to dress up in order to have sex with a nun (Keith Moon) playing the harp. The announcer, whose is actually an American named Rance Muhammitz, states that Larry's statements are part of the score to 200 Motels, a movie that occurred as a fantasy while The Mothers of Invention were touring.As the band, who include Mark Volman, Howard Kaylan, Ian Underwood, Aynsley Dunbar and George Duke, plays in concert, Muhammitz continues that the film addresses the ways in which ""touring will make you crazy.""The band stops in the town of Centerville, whose motto is ""A real nice place to bring your kids up,"" consisting mainly of a boutique, a bar called Redneck Eats, the concert hall and a motel just like the hundreds of others in which they have stayed. As the band recovers from their show, Muhammitz appears and explains that the film's conceptual framework will be nonsensical. The band members realize that Frank is always listening to them, and attempt to act naturally so he cannot tell that they know he is recording them.While band member Cowboy Burtram (Jimmy Carl Black) cares only about the money they will earn for their roles in the film, another entourage member suggests that the musicians form a separate band and split from Zappa, who at age 30 is too old for rock and roll. As Muhammitz, accompanied by a female reporter (Pamela Des Barres), talks to the band, Mark and Howard enter Centerville, watched and judged by two groupies named Lucy and Janet (Lucy Offerall and Janet Neville-Ferguson).In the bar, Cowboy Burtram sings to patrons wearing hardhats and pig masks. Later, Cowboy Burtram questions whether or not Muhammitz is the devil.In a long monologue, Larry the Dwarf/Zappa states that the musician, as the consummate outsider, still has actual physical needs, and introduces an experimental reorientation facility designed to retrain useless old musicians. While some will enter the military and some learn shorthand, others will disappear on a special train.Back in the motel, Larry the Dwarf/Zappa feverishly writes a symphony. In his mind, the orchestra sings about soup and getting ""hot and horny,"" after which the nun attempts to overdose. Meanwhile, Jeff, a former band member, takes drugs in a motel room and subsequently decides he is wasting his life and talent on Zappa's ""comedy music."" He then rolls the rancid bathroom rug into a cigarette and smokes it, after which he hallucinates images of alcohol, the devil, motel rooms and the other band members.The nun, afraid she is dying, is helped by Janet and Lucy, who then prepare to go out to what they call the ""fake nightclub."" As Janet performs a preparatory ritual involving squats, the band members also prepare for the evening, sprucing themselves up in the hope of finding a woman with whom to spend the night. Leaving their individual starting gates, much like at a race track, the men hurdle themselves into the club and quickly devolve into an orgy. After the nightclub is closed, one of the band members creates a potion and feeds it to another musician, who returns to his hotel room to hallucinate.In the final scene, Muhammitz returns to announce the end of the movie, as all of the characters gather on one stage to sing and sermonize the experimental and bizarre feature movie we just watched."

John Grant, a teacher working in the remote Australian town of Tiboonda, is under a financial bond with his Government job. At the end of term before Christmas holidays, he plans to visit his girlfriend in Sydney. In order to catch a flight to Sydney, he takes a train to the nearby mining town called Bundanyabba (or ""The Yabba""), and plans to stay there overnight before moving on further to the airport. But things go grossly out of script as he is engulfed by the Yabba and its disconcerting residents.—PipingHotViews A struggling English teacher finds himself in a town that threatens to send him down an inescapable abyss of madness, drunken frenzies, and a total loss of humanity. This is life Down Under unlike anything you've seen before. This is Australia at its most severe cinematic extremes; this is life in the outskirts of society.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 This film, an Australian masterpiece and my favourite was lost for 30 years, but has recently been remastered and released to the public. A more nihilistic view of Australia has never been filmed.
John Grant is bonded by the New South Wales Education Department to teach at the lonely outback trainstop of Tiboonda. Desolate and isolated as Australia can be, on holiday after a beer with publican ""Charlie"", he must overnight in ""The Yabba"" (a thinly disguised Broken Hill) before travelling onto his girlfriend and the beaches of Sydney. However the local policeman, Jock Crawford introduces John to the hellish nature of outback pubs, gambling at two-up and the unrelenting heat. Jock explains to John that one of his few duties is to sort out the suicides. Losing all his money and stranded in town, every one he meets has the same paralysing greeting - ""New to the Yabba?"".
The unedifying, ugly, alcoholic, racist and misogynist nature of 70's outback life is soon apparent to John. His brief meeting with ""Doc"" during a drunken two-up game presages further developments.
When broke he meets Tim who continues to encourage John to drink incessantly. A boozy evening results in a furtive sexual liaison with Tim's daughter Jeanette, completed when John vomits midway through the act. Jack Thompson's character Dick asks ""Whats wrong with him - rather talk to a sheila than drink?"" Doc turns up at Tim's house, and the alcohol-fuelled debauchery continues. Dick, Doc and half the Yabba have had their way with Jeanette.
Drunk to unconsciousness, John awakes the next day in Doc's donga (outback shack without amenities) to be fed beer and fried kangaroo. Doc admits to being an alcoholic doctor of medicine - couldn't survive in Sydney, but ""out here no-one cares"". Doc reveals his sexual appetite is met only by Jeanette - if she was a bloke, she wouldn't be known as a ""slut"".
Then ""the boys"" from Tim's party the night before arrive to take John on a kangaroo hunting/shooting trip. Australia does not get more ugly than this. Doc cuts off the roo's testicles, and they adjourn to a local (outback) pub for more grog before setting out to spotlight the roos after dark. The hunting scenes are real, many kangaroos are killed, one having his throat slit on camera by the boys, then John also gets his chance; in these politically correct times such scenes would never be released.Near dawn, they return to the pub, and in a drunken rampage destroy the joint. John ends up back at Doc's donga, and a homosexual encounter is implied. John, full of self-loathing, in the heat whilst hungover wanders into the Yabba with a loaded gun. He runs into Jock, who encourages him to have yet another beer! John attempts to hitch out of town, but after giving away has last dollar, returns again to his personal hell in the Yabba. John ends up back in the donga, pointing his rifle at his temple - and subsequently awakes in hospital.Jock presents John with a statement for him to sign about his ""accidental"" shooting, Doc takes him from hospital to station, and John returns to teaching at the desolate Tiboonda. On the train, he gratefully accepts a beer..... At Tiboonda, Charlie welcomes John home with ""Djava good holiday""?......"

(Original description from CD case)—rawhyd Somewhere in harbourside Sydney, Australia, a family lives within a high-rise apartment building where the mother is preparing a meal and listening to the radio. Her fourteen year old daughter (Jenny Agutter) and six year old son (Luc Roeg) swim in the building's pool overlooking a view of the ocean while their father (John Meillon), deep in troubled thought, watches them from their balcony.One day, the father takes his children, still in their school uniforms, on a picnic into the Outback. He parks the car and reads while his daughter sets up a blanket with their lunch. Her brother plays nearby with his water gun and toy soldiers. Suddenly, and for reasons unclear to his children, the father announces it is time to go and brandishes a gun, firing several shots at them. The boy thinks it all to be a game but his sister understands the danger and shields her brother as they run from their mad father. She watches in horror as her father returns to the car and sets it on fire before seating himself within and putting a bullet into his head. Quickly, and keeping her brother's eyes averted, the girl retrieves their radio, a scarf, and what food she can carry before setting off into the wilderness with her brother.The siblings walk for hours under the hot sun, calmed by irrelevant radio broadcasts, and walking past a host of wild creatures. Come nightfall, they make a crude camp for themselves, much to the boy's delight. In the morning, the girl leads them up a rocky hillside where she hopes to find some bearings. However, she can see nothing but a broad spanse of wilderness. When they finish their lemonade, the girl opens a can of vegetables from which they drink the juice. Recalling an uncle's story of military training, the girl suggests they eat salt to retain water and surmises to her brother that they may spend some time in the desert. She remains stoic, but wary, while her brother is blissfully unaware of their situation, remaining entertained by the radio and his toys. Eventually, after becoming filthy and tired, they come upon a lone tree standing over a pool of water where parakeets flock and feast on fallen fruit. The boy puts on in his mouth and proclaims that it 'tastes lovely'. They wash in the water and the girl scolds her brother to take care of his clothes so they will last. When he asks if they are lost, the girl replies that they are not, trying to remain chipper. They sleep to the sounds of the radio as night animals stir around them.In the morning, the girl wakes to find that their water hole has dried up and the fruit has either been eaten or spoiled. The girl decides to remain where they are, hoping that the water will return. As they nap in the hot sun, the boy spots an aborigine youth (David Gulpilil) pursuing an animal for food. They make contact and the children attempt to communicate with the aborigine boy. However, he does not understand their language and merely stares at them with curiosity. The girl repeats their need for water but the word is incomprehensible to the aborigine. When her brother mimics drinking, the aborigine understands and shows them how to dig for water using a hollow tube to drink through. Assuming that he will lead them to civilization, the siblings accompany the aborigine, unaware that he is on a 'walkabout', a coming-of-age journey that every male aborigine youth must take alone in order to be initiated as an adult in his tribe.As they travel the Outback, the aborigine kills and harvests food for them, giving them all plenty to eat and drink. The move from the desert to greener pastures and forests where wildlife becomes plentiful. When the boy becomes sunburnt from going shirtless, the aborigine rubs pig fat on his back to alleviate the burn. While communication between them remains limited, the trio share food and play together, though cultural differences are evident; the boy attempts to share his toy soldiers with the aborigine, but he finds no use for them and tosses them aside. Despite their time together, the aborigine and the girl develop a tension, in part due to their sexual maturity. While the girl remains wary and tries to keep her distance, the aborigine develops feelings for her. When he tries to talk to her, she does not understand, though her brother attempts to find meaning using pantomime. The aborigine boy stops near a rock cliff and draws a story on the rock face. The girl follows his lead and draws a house, hoping the boy will understand. He seems to.Aborigine workers and children surround a solitary house and trailer in the Outback, painted white with plaster from the figurines they're making. Their boss, a gruff white male overlooks their progress, berating them at times, while his wistful wife walks the property. She comes upon the aborigine boy and speaks to him but he rebuffs the woman's advances and walks away. The woman spots the children the boy is with but they remain unaware of her presence and follow the aborigine further into the wilds.So near and yet so far away, less than a few miles from the children's location, a group of scientists fiddle with weather balloons, though the men seem more interested in the solitary woman on their team. They look over at her every time she leans and one man goes so far as to eliminate further competition for her affections by letting loose one of their balloons, inciting a short chase by the other men. The balloon drifts away and eventually is caught in brambles and found by the aborigine boy. Tired, the girl asks him when they will reach their destination. Her brother translates the aborigine's signs that they should arrive that day.Later, they come upon a homestead overlooking a field of green and backed by a forest. The girl runs ahead along a picket fence but is upset to find that the home is deserted and crumbling. They set up residence there and the aborigine boy tries to speak to the girl but does not understand her sorrow. He watches her as she tours the home and begins to cry after finding some old photographs. He remains confused but understand when the girl asks for 'water'. Later on, the aborigine shows the boy a paved road near the homestead before going hunting. He chases an animal with his spear but is knocked aside as a truck carrying white men drives past and guns the animal down. The boy watches in silent confusion as the men tote the animal away.He returns to the homestead and ignores the girl's hello. His feelings culminating, he decides to perform a courtship dance for the girl, perhaps knowing that he can never return to his tribe. He paints himself with white clay and puts feathers on his arms and head. However, his dance frightens the girl and she shuts herself inside the house with her brother while he continues to dance outside into the night. Despite his visibly exhaustion, the girl refuses to speak to him. When her brother tells her of the road that he found with the aborigine, the girl decides that they will continue along their journey alone come morning.The next day, they dress fully in their school uniforms and collect their things. The boy looks for the aborigine, who has disappeared, but the girl insists that he went back to his people and that his absence is for the best. Her brother then tells her he tried to offer the aborigine his penknife as a gift, but the boy didn't take it. Puzzled, the girl follows her brother to where the aborigine had propped himself in a hanging position in the low branches of a tree, dead of exhaustion and heartbreak. The girl swats a few ants off the boy's body, looks at him sadly, and then takes her brother to the road. They follow it to a row of buildings near a mine quarry and knock on one of the trailer doors. An older man answers begrudgingly and tells them to leave. When the girl begs for help, he tells them where they can wait for someone to collect them. The siblings walk away from the trailer and its well watered lawn to the old mine where they play together among scrap metal.Years later, a young man returns home where he greets his wife, the girl now grown, and tells her that he's been promoted to a position that will finance a vacation on the Gold Coast. His wife's mind wanders and when he asks her what she's thinking of, she replies, 'nothing'. But we see her visions of years past when she and her brother bathed and played happily, and without trivial needs, in the Outback with their aborigine friend."

But David turns down Tom's offer and exits the pub.David and Amy are driving to their new cottage. They meet Norman Scutt (Ken Hutchison), who's busy fixing up their garage. While there, they also meet Chris Cawsey (Jim Norton), a giggling bloke who specializes in ridding the garage of rats. Chris and Norman are aware of the social turmoil and escalating violence of Vietnam-era American society, and that David somehow retreated to Wakely to escape his country's violence. They begin to challenge David, proving him to be spineless.At home, David becomes intensely preoccupied with his research. He is verbally abusive to Amy and her cat, who's often missing. This angers his wife. At one point, she defaces his blackboard and changes his mathematical equations. David responds by saying, ""what is this grammar school? Jesus Christ"".Meanwhile, David is helping his wife prepare for dinner when he sees Norman and Chris receiving a lift from friend and lorry driver Phil Riddaway (Donald Webster), a hulking presence who serves to round out the potentially menacing gang making life unpleasant for David.Norman, Chris, and Phil meet at the pub with Tom and company, where Tom begins to suspect pedophile and one-time podiatrist Henry Niles (David Warner) of molesting young girls, including his own Janice. Tom insists that Henry's brother, John (Peter Arne), ""keep a close watch on him"".David and Amy are getting ready for bed. The voyeuristic Janice spies on them. After a long night of lecturing and cheating antics, they retire for the night.On the next day, Amy becomes increasingly incensed by David's neglectful ways. She soon finds herself being ogled at by the men working on her house (Charlie, Norman, and Chris). She complains of this to David, who suggests she ""wear a bra"". David continues to denote he left his country on a ""grant to study"". ""You left because you didn't want to take a stand. Commit!"", says Amy. David finalizes the argument by saying ""we came here because you once told me that we could be happier"". Frustrated, Amy parades topless in front of the workers outside.The following day begins when Amy exclaims that her cat is missing. A frustrated David leaves the house, only to find himself terrorized by the workmen in Phil's lorry. On their way to the pub, they siphon their raging jealousy and contempt for the American academic by attempting to run his vehicle off the road.Outside the pub, David notices Janice getting too close to Henry. He becomes flabbergasted by John's violent treatment towards his brother, as well as Bobby's caveman-like attitude towards his sister.David enters the pub surrounded by his tormentors, who persist in jeering at him. There he meets local one-armed magistrate John Scott (T.P. McKenna), who informs of David's invitation to a church social the coming Thursday and accompanies him to the house where he meets Reverend Barny Hood (Colin Welland) and his wife.Back in the house, David is introduced to Barny and his wife. The fatuous vicar is in awe of David's research and his study of ""possible structures, interiors...radiation"". David calls himself an ""astro-mathematician"". He goes on to assess the importance of his scientific findings and the impact of religion on the mounting violence and bloodshed inherent in all present societies. It is learned that David came to Wakely mainly to escape the violence which has become a part of everyday life.Later that night, Amy's cat is found hanging in the closet. ""To prove to you that they can get into your bedroom"", in her estimation. Amy suspects Norman or Chris of killing her cat, while David states ""it could've been anybody passing"".David is reluctant to confront the workers over Amy's cat. Instead, by having Charlie, Norman, and Chris set up the mantrap over by the fireplace, he agrees to go out hunting with them.David accompanies Charlie, Norman, Chris, and Phil to the moors on a British version of ""snipe hunt"" where they keep him busy holding a sack open for the birds he believes will run into it. They spread about.While David is gone, Amy is visited by Charlie, who has been seething with lust over her. Amy feels Charlie has some knowledge regarding her slain cat, but he promptly tries to seduce her. When she refuses, he forces himself on her. In the process, Norman eventually shows up at the house and threatens Charlie at gunpoint. Norman gleefully rapes Amy as well, while Charlie begrudgingly assists his friend in holding her down.Amy doesn't tell David what happened. David tries to solve the problems in their marriage by ""going back to the basics"". He fires the four workers the next day. They ""stuck it"" to him on the moors, he explains.In a moment of dis-consolation, he sits in the field staring at an indeterminate distance.Some time later, the couple attend the local church function where the vicar Barny displays his penchant for magic tricks while the audience enjoys the show. Amy, haunted by memories of the rape, has a breakdown. As the show progresses, Janice approaches Henry. They leave the church and walk along the yard, as seen by Bobby. Bobby tells his father, Tom. The enraged Tom orders Bobby and John to find them. During this time, David and Amy have left the church as well. Tom, Charlie, Norman, Chris, and Phil visit the pub to learn of Henry's whereabouts. David, driving home in the dense fog, rescues Henry. Unbeknownst to David, Henry has just strangled Janice who was taunting him.Amy, aware of Henry's pedophilic tendencies, doesn't want Henry in the house. David tries to call the magistrate at the pub and informs Harry the bartender of Henry. Tom and his four young allies learn of Henry's whereabouts and go to the house to do violence to Henry.Since they ""know the American"", Charlie, Norman, and Chris ask for Tom and Phil to wait outside the house so they can find out where Janice is. David suddenly finds himself accosted by his three previous tormentors, two of whom raped Amy. David prevents them from hurting Henry, but Charlie says ""We've come to get this bloody freak...With your cooperation or without it"". As Henry proves unresponsive to their questioning, Charlie, Norman, and Chris agree to look for Janice until the doctor and police arrive.Enraged by the lack of knowledge of his missing daughter, Tom attempts to open the ""solid"" door while his cronies start blasting David's windows. One of them, Charlie, yells ""Look, you stupid yank. Let's have Niles before someone gets hurt."" David hides Henry in the lavvy.As the men lay siege to the house, what David says to Amy is key to understanding the situation. ""This is where I live. This is me. I will not allow violence against this house."" Moments later, the magistrate arrives to calm Tom and the others down but gets killed in the process. As accessories to a drunk who shot the sheriff, the men all decide to enter the house to get at Henry. Amy protests that David send Henry out, but he tries to keep them out of the house. He turns off the lights.David uses every means and skill he knows to fight them off. He boils whiskey and even opens the mantrap. Amy tries to leave, but David stops her. Realizing that ""they've gone too far to back down"",
David suggests Amy be cooperative if they are to survive the night. Using such household items as a poker and wire, he succeeds at keeping the men out of the house at every turn.As the relentless mob invade the house, David plays bagpipe music and decides to strike back. He squibs Tom's feet with gunfire. Tom later dies from his wounds. Phil climbs up the window, threatening to kill David. David dispatches him with a poker. Shortly thereafter, he turns on his living room light to find the knife-wielding Chris is inside the house. He beats the man to death with a poker. As Charlie prepares to shoot David, he is alarmed by Amy's screaming in her bedroom upstairs. Norman is trying to rape her. Charlie shoots him, and then finds himself fighting with David. David kills Charlie when he hits him over the head with the mantrap.David is slightly taken aback by the carnage. ""Jesus. I got 'em all"", David exclaims. A seriously wounded Phil appears out of nowhere and wrestles David to the stairs. Completely exhausted, David orders Amy to get the gun. She gets the shotgun and shoots the thug dead. There's no simple way back from the violence into which David has wandered.After the bloodbath, Amy stays in the house while David leaves with Henry. Henry complains ""I don't know my way home"", David replies, ""That's okay. I don't either."""

Harold and Maude,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067185/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Young, rich, and obsessed with death, Harold finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude at a funeral. Young adult Harold Chasen, solitary and friendless by choice, is obsessed with death, this fascination manifesting itself in he staging his own fake suicides, driving a hearse and attending funerals, even of people he doesn't know, all to the chagrin of his exasperated wealthy mother with whom he lives.

It is at a series of funerals that Harold meets Maude, on the cusp of her eightieth birthday, she who too attends funerals of strangers. Unlike Harold, Maude is obsessed with life - her own life to be more precise - she does whatever she wants to please herself, damned what others may think or how they may be affected. Since she can't take material possessions with her, she is more interested in experiences, with whatever material possessions she has - often ""borrowed"" without asking - only to further those experiences. Their friendship is initially based on how the other can further their own priority. But as Maude shows Harold how to truly live, Harold falls in love with her. Their relationship, already limited in time by the sheer math, is curtailed even more as Maude shows him only not how to live well, but die well.—Huggo Harold and Maude shows that love and sex are activated by a relationship enlivened by mutual complimentary needs.

However, Maude has a surprise for Harold that is to change his life forever.—Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> Harold is an eccentric young man. His hobbies are attending funerals and faking suicides. He became interested in death after he nearly escaped it in a chemical explosion at school one time. Ever since, he's been staging fake hangings, drownings, gunshots, you name it. Harold pulls these stunts to irritate his mother and satisfy his markedly warped sense of humor. He's from a wealthy household and has nothing better to do. He even performs these stunts in front of the dates his mother arranges for him, all of whom run out the door as a result. The mother is trying to keep him from being a dejected loner. Harold doesn't care. Harold likes Maude.Maude is an unorthodox woman. She's an enlivened 79-yr-old old lady that lives without any hangups. She isn't preoccupied with judgment. She makes risqué sculptures, poses nude, plays a variety of instruments, steals cars-and goes to funerals too. That's where she and Harold meet. As much as she loves life and takes it like a breath of fresh air, she accepts death and isn't afraid of it. To her, death is a part of the cycle of life. And when it comes to living, sky's the limit. That's what she wants to teach the rather melancholic Harold.Harold and Maude are drawn to each other despite their considerable age gap.

Harold then takes off in his car and it is seen going off a cliff, though when the camera pans up, Harold is standing there playing the banjo Maude gave him.

Vanishing Point,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067927/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the 1970s, car delivery driver Kowalski delivers hot rods in record time but always runs into trouble. Kowalski works for a car delivery service. He takes delivery of a 1970 Dodge Challenger to take from Colorado to San Francisco, California. Shortly after pickup, he takes a bet to get the car there in less than 15 hours. After a few run-ins with motorcycle cops and highway patrol they start a chase to bring him into custody. Along the way, Kowalski is guided by Supersoul - a blind DJ with a police radio scanner. Throw in lots of chase scenes, gay hitchhikers, a naked woman riding a motorbike, lots of Mopar and you've got a great cult hit from the early 70's.—Matthew Barry Newman plays a car delivery driver named Kowalski who works for Argo's Car Delivery Service in Denver, Colorado and is assigned to deliver a white 1970 Dodge Challenger to San Francisco. Flashbacks which appear throughout the movie hint that he has either lost everything he has ever wanted and was reduced to taking the job of a car delivery driver as a last resort, or he is (what is called today) an adrenaline junkie. He is a Medal of Honor winning Vietnam veteran, a former law enforcement officer, former race car driver, and former motorcycle racer. He lost his job as a cop apparently after being framed in a drug bust, perhaps in retaliation for preventing his partner from raping a young girl. He seemingly gave up his automobile and motorcycle racing careers after two near-fatal accidents. He flashes back to a girlfriend, first in a snow-covered landscape, then at the California shore. Vera offers Kowalski marijuana, and comments on his war wound. Vera appears to be Kowalski's great love, and her death while surfing appears to be a major factor in Kowalski's alienation and resignation to death in the film.As the movie opens, Kowalski is near the end of his chase by the California Highway Patrol, where two bulldozers and a CBS News truck are setting up. After seeing the bulldozers, he turns around, only to run into three patrol cars further up the road. He then drives off the road to think, then gets back into the car and continues to drive back toward the roadblock. As the white Challenger passes a black Chrysler Imperial, the movie freezes, and the Challenger vanishes on Sunday at 10:02 am.The Imperial continues on, and the film then flashes back to Denver, Colorado, two days earlier on Friday at 11:30 pm, where Kowalski's journey began. He has just arrived in Denver with a black Chrysler Imperial he is delivering from San Francisco. His supervisor demands he get some rest, but Kowalski insists on taking on a delivery back to San Francisco that night. Kowalski is assigned to deliver the white Challenger. He stops at a biker bar to buy some Benzedrine pills and tells his dealer Jake (Lee Weaver) that he must get to San Francisco by 3 o'clock the next day (although the delivery is not due until Monday). They make a small bet (the cost of the speed), and Kowalski takes off at high speed out of Denver.Later Saturday morning near Glenwood Springs, Colorado, two motorcycle cops appear in Kowalski's rear view mirror and try to get him to pull over for speeding. He runs one off the road and, after stopping and seeing that the officer is unhurt, Kowalski takes off again and shakes the other officer by jumping across a trench. Kowalski is chased across the states of Colorado, Utah, and Nevada and into California, with the police unable to catch him. The whole way, Kowalski has his radio tuned to the station KOW, which is broadcasting out of Goldfield, Nevada. A blind African-American DJ at KOW known as Super Soul listens to the police radio frequency and encourages Kowalski to evade the police. Super Soul seems to understand Kowalski and, through a writer's conceit, seems to see and hear Kowalski's reactions.At one point Kowalski stops for gas at a remote station, and upon seeing the young woman at the gas pump, flashes back to a scene in his police career in which an older police officer molests a young woman of similar appearance in the back of a police car in an attempt to extract information about drug dealing. Kowalski intervenes to save the girl. In the present day, it is left somewhat unclear if this is the same woman or someone who reminds Kowalski of her.With the help of Super Soul, who calls Kowalski ""the last American hero"" on his radio show, Kowalski begins to gain attention among the counterculture and news media. Bikers and hippies flock to KOW radio in Goldfield to offer support. In a police chase in Nevada, Kowalski finds himself surrounded by police and flees into the desert. There, he blows a left front tire. After changing it, he encounters a rattlesnake and a snake catcher behind his car while placing the original tire in the trunk. Kowalski is helped by the old man who catches snakes in the desert to escape a police chopper that is now searching the desert for him. The old man leads him to a Pentecostal sect that reluctantly gives him fuel. The old man then redirects Kowalski back to the highway. There, he picks up two gay hitchhikers stranded en route to San Francisco with a ""Just Married"" sign in their rear window. They become combative and try to hold him up at gunpoint, but Kowalski throws them out of the car.In the afternoon of Saturday, a police officer and some unidentified thugs, shouting racial epithets, raid the KOW studio and physically assault Super Soul and his engineer. Near the California state line, Kowalski is helped by a hippie biker and his nude girlfriend, who has followed Kowalski's police career and made a collage of articles about his story. The impression is that she was infatuated with Kowalski, but she is unable to finish what she meant to say and rides away on her motorcycle. They discover that Super Soul's encouragement is now being directed by the police to entrap Kowalski; they give him more Benzedrine pills, and help him get through the roadblock trap by strapping a motorbike with a red light and air raid siren to the top of the Challenger, fooling the police into clearing the roadblock for him to speed through, putting him in California by Saturday at 7:12 pm. This means that 3:00 pm on SaturdayKowalski's original goalhas passed without comment. Kowalski calls Jake the dealer on a payphone, who has read about the chase in the newspaper. Kowalski reassures him that he's fine and still intends to deliver the car on Monday. However, the California police have put sensors on back roads that allow them to track Kowalski as he drives through the night.In the UK release of the film, Kowalski then picks up a mysterious hitchhiker (played by Charlotte Rampling). Kowalski accepts marijuana from her despite being shown refusing drugs (other than speed) several times in the past. He stops the car when he starts feeling stoned. She says she has been, ""waiting for him, everywhere and since forever."" When he awakens the next morning, she is gone, without a trace. According to interviews with Barry Newman and commentary from the director, the hitchhiker was a representation of death finally catching up with Kowalski.It is still early Sunday morning when Kowalski makes it to Cisco, California (a vacant cattle town in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of San Francisco, but actually filmed in the remote village of Cisco, Utah, abandoned today). There, with the California Highway Patrol in hot pursuit, Kowalski catches up to the opening of the film and crashes into the two bulldozers set up by the police as a roadblock, producing the fatal fireball of his death."
Let's Scare Jessica to Death,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067341/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A recently institutionalized woman has bizarre experiences after moving into a supposedly haunted country farmhouse and fears she may be losing her sanity once again. After a stint in a psychiatric facility Jessica, her husband and a friend move to remote farm they have recently purchased. There they find a young woman by the name of Emily living in the house and they invite her to stay. When Jessica goes for a swim in the lake, she sees a body just below the water's surface. When they go into the village to sell some old furniture, they learn that a woman by the name of Abigail Bishop drowned in the lake and her body was never found. Local folklore has that Abigail is now a vampire roaming the countryside. A mute blond girl leads her to the body of a dead man but the body is not there when Jessica goes for help. Jessica and those around begin to wonder if she is losing her mind.—garykmcd After Jessica is released from the psychiatric institution where she had been recuperating for six months from a nervous breakdown, Duncan, her musician husband, takes her to live at a farmhouse in upstate New York to restart their lives as apple farmers, he having sunk all their money into the proposition. Their friend Woody is staying with them indefinitely to help them get settled. They don't seem to be welcomed by the locals, arguably in part because they are driving a hearse, in part because they are deemed hippies in indeed being what they themselves would consider free spirits, and in part because they are living at the old Bishop place with its legends concerning the mysterious end of some of the Bishop family members. Arriving at the farmhouse, they discover a young woman squatting there, Emily who they eventually ask to stay in she seeming to be a free spirit like them. Throughout this situation, Jessica, in not wanting to appear crazy and thus sent back to the hospital, doesn't want to tell especially Duncan that she has been seeing visions of people and is hearing voices telling her to do things which to her are real but which others would probably tell her are figments of her imagination, Jessica who additionally fears she going crazy an excuse for Duncan to leave her especially as he seems to be attracted to Emily. The question then becomes what truly is happening to Jessica.—Huggo Jessica has just been released from a mental hospital. Wanting to ""start over"", she moves into an old New England farmhouse with her husband and a friend. Before they even arrive Jess starts having strange encounters, and after they find a young transient in their new home, things start getting rather nasty. Seems this redheaded hippie chick is in fact a vampire, a onetime resident of the house who drowned on her wedding day, and all the old guys in town are her harpies (they all have scarred necks and arms). Or is Jess really having another breakdown? Who knows...—William J. Spiropoulos <spiropoulos.4@osu.edu> A woman released from a mental hospital moves to an old countryside house with her husband and a friend to recuperate, but begins having strange visions and experiences around the property. Is there really something strange happening, or is it all in her in mind?—Anonymous Wearing just a nightgown, Jessica [Zohra Lambert] sits in a rowboat, staring at the water. ""I sit here, and I can't believe that it happened,"" she says to herself, ""and yet I have to believe it. Dreams or nightmares? Madness or sanity? I don't know which is which.""Backing up a few weeks, Jessica has just been released from six months in a mental institution. In order to protect her from the stresses of NYC, husband Duncan [Garton Heyman] has given up his job as celloist for the New York
Philharmonic and purchased the old Bishop farm on Brookfield Island, Connecticut. When he, Jessica, and their hippy friend Woody [Kevin O'Connor] arrive at the tall, white, almost-gothic country home, they are surprised to find a
pale, mysterious, red-haired woman already living there. Her name is Emily [Mariclare Costello], and she is simply a drifter using the house because she thought it was abandoned, she tells them. When Emily offers to move on, however, Jessica invites her to have dinner with them and stay the night. Emily happily agrees. After dinner, Emily entertains on her lute while Duncan accompanies on his cello. Then, Emily engages Jessica in a seance to call up any spirits that might have died in the house. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), none show up.One night moves into more nights, and Emily continues to stay. It's becoming obvious that Woody is attracted to her, and Jessica doesn't mind having Emily around, especially because Jessica has begun hearing voices and seeing a blonde girl [Gretchen Corbett] looking at her and then disappearing. Another time, her leg was grabbed by someone under the water in the cove where she was swimming. Jessica is afraid to talk about these things with Duncan or Woody lest they think she's relapsing.Soon, Jessica becomes aware of other problems. 1) Duncan also appears to be attracted to Emily, 2) the men in town, all of whom are bandaged in some way or another, seem to be hostile towards them, and 3) money is tight. To get money for food, Duncan and Jessica decide to sell off some of the antiques they find around the farm. One of the items is a silver-framed portrait of the Bishop family -- father, mother, and daughter Abigail. Sam Dorker [Alan Manson], ex New Yorker and antique dealer, offers them $50 for the frame and tells them the story of how 20-year old Abigail Bishop drowned in 1880 just before her wedding day. Legend says that she's still alive, roving the island as a vampire. Jessica finds the story fascinating, but Duncan just wants to take the money and go home.After returning to the farm, Jessica and Duncan go for a walk around their property. Emily is sitting on the front porch playing her lute, and Woody is out spraying the apple trees. Jessica finds a mole and Duncan offers to take it back to the house and put it in a jar while Jessica stays in the graveyard to do some grave rubbings. She is just about to do a rubbing of Abigail Bishop's grave when she notices the blonde girl beckoning her to follow. The girl leads Jessica to a cliff, at the bottom of which lies Sam Dorker dead and bloodied. By the time Jessica finds Duncan, however, the body is gone. Did she really see it? The look on Duncan's face says that he thinks Jessica is going nuts again. Just then, Jessica notices the blonde girl standing on the cliff above them. Duncan sees her, too, and gives chase. He catches her, but when Jessica tries to ask her questions, the girl is either mute or won't talk. Suddenly, Emily walks up, and the girl runs off.That evening at dinner, it's obvious even to Woody that Duncan and Emily have eyes for each other. When Jessica retires early, Woody tells Duncan to take care of his wife. Reluctantly, Duncan goes up to their bedroom. Instead of taking care of his wife, however, he tells Jessica that she needs to return to New York to see her doctor again. Jessica becomes upset and tells Duncan that she wants to sleep apart tonight, so Duncan goes down to sleep on the couch where he is easily seduced by Emily.The next morning, Jessica finds the little mole has been repeatedly stabbed to death. Jessica denies doing it, but Duncan decides that it's time to get help for her and drives into town in search of a phone. While he's gone, Jessica goes up to the attic where she is surprised to come face to face with the silver-framed portrait of the Bishop family that they had sold just yesterday to Sam Dorker. When she takes a look at the three figures in the portait, she is astounded to see how closely Abigail Bishop resembles Emily. Is it possible they are one and the same?Suddenly, Jessica sees Emily coming up the stairs. Jessica tries to keep her cool while Emily denies that she is Abigail, all the while she is stroking Jessica's feverish face. Finally, out of a desire to get safely out of the attic, Jessica agrees to go with Emily for a cool swim in the lake, even though she's afraid of the water after being grabbed at the other day. As the two women sit at the end of the dock, Emily rubs suntan lotion on Jessica. Suddenly, Emily pushes Jessica into the water and jumps in after her. When Jessica panics, Emily apologizes for scaring her when all she wanted to do was have a little fun. Jessica wades towards shore and looks back to see that Emily has disappeared. She hears Emily's voice in her head and then sees her reddish-hair bobbing to the surface. When a pale white arm grabs her and tries to pull her underwater, Jessica fights to break loose and return to shore. She looks back at the water and watches Emily, pale and dressed in Abigail's wedding gown, rising slowly
from the water and walking towards her, all the while silently saying, ""Stay, Jessica, stay. Follow me.""When Emily reaches Jessica and tries to bite her neck, Jessica's bravado returns. She runs back to the house, locks herself in her room, and waits for Duncan to return. Hours pass, during which Jessica can hear Emily's voice whispering to her. ""I'm still here... I won't go away... you can't get rid of me... I'm in your blood... you want to die."" Come 5 PM and Duncan still hasn't returned, so Jessica changes out of her swimming suit and hitches a ride into town. While Jessica is on her way to town, Woody returns from working the fields to find that the only one at home is Emily. Although Woody doesn't like how Emily has been playing Duncan, he readily submits when she comes on to him. He gets a bite in the neck for his reward.When Jessica gets into town, she sees Duncan's car and asks about his whereabouts, but none of the men will admit to having seen him. Jessica notices that every man has cuts on his body and backs away... straight into the arms of Sam Dorker. Now totally confused about her own sanity, she runs back toward the farm. When she can run no more, she collapses on the ground and lies there until it turns dark and she hears Duncan calling her name. Duncan drives her the rest of the way home, and they go upstairs to bed. As they begin to kiss, Jessica notices a cut on Duncan's neck. Jessica tries to convince herself that it's only in her mind, but then she sees Emily brandishing a carving knife and leading the men from town.

In 1830, forty years to the day since the last manifestation of their dreaded vampirism, the Karnstein heirs use the blood of an innocent to bring forth the evil that is the beautiful Mircalla - or as she was in 1710, Carmilla. The nearby Finishing School offers rich pickings not only in in the blood of nubile young ladies but also with the headmaster who is desperate to become Mircalla's disciple, and the equally besotted and even more foolish author Richard Lestrange.—J-26 In the deserted chapel at Karnstein castle, Count [Mike Raven] and Countess
Karnstein [Barbara Jefford] conduct a satanic ceremony to resurrect the body of their
daughter Mircalla. Richard LeStrange [Michael Johnson] has come to the village to get
background for his books about witches, vampires and black magic. Warned
to beware of Karnstein castle, he takes no heed. Immediately upon entering
the castle, he is set upon by three women dressed in shrouds. They turn out to
be students on an educational tour from Miss Simpson's [Helen Christie] fashionable
finishing school. As LeStrange is being introduced to Miss Simpson and her
students, a new student arrives, one Mircalla Herritzen [Yutte Stensgaard]. LeStrange falls
in love immediately.Later that evening, when LeStrange relates his adventure to the men
at the village inn, one of the serving girls is found dead with two holes
in her neck, and LeStrange is convinced that the Karnstein story is not
mere superstition. When he chances to meet the recently-hired teacher of
English literature on his way to Miss Simpson's school, he tricks him into
going to Vienna and arranges to take his position at the school.
Shortly thereafter, Mircalla's roommate Susan Pelley [Pippa Steele] disappears. When
the headmaster Giles Barton [Ralph Bates] discovers the secret of Mircalla/Carmilla, he
offers himself to her. Later that day, after Barton's body is found,
LeStrange goes through his books and discovers what Barton had
learned--that Mircalla Herritzen is Carmilla Karnstein. LeStrange
confesses his love for her, and they make ""strange love"".Miss Simpson, worried sick about the disappearance of a student and
the death of her headmaster, decides not to call in the authorities or to
notify Susan Pelley's father, particularly when Countess Herritzen's
private physician agrees to certify Barton's death as a heart attack.
However, dance teacher Jenny Playfair [Suzanna Leigh] notifies both the police and Mr
Pelley [David Healy], all of whom arrive to investigate.
The Karnsteins manage to kill the policeman who has just discovered
Susan's body in the bottom of a well, but Mr Pelley arrives with a writ of
exhumation and a pathologist to investigate his daughter's death. Susan's
body is exhumed (it has just been conveniently buried by the Karnsteins),
and talk gets around that she was the victim of a vampire. Together with
the village priest, the villagers storm Karnstein castle with the intent
of burning it to the ground.
LeStrange also makes his way to the castle, looking to save Mircalla.
The villagers trap all three Karnsteins in the burning castle, where a
burning timber falls from the ceiling and drives itself through Mircalla's
heart. LeStrange is saved from the fire, but Count and Countess Karnstein
remain.""Fire is not harmful to us,"" says the Count as the villagers watch the castle burn.

Young Frieda, Gustav's niece, will involve herself in a devilish cult, and become an instrument of Justice in the region. In nineteenth century middle-Europe, orphaned teenage twins Maria and Frieda go to live with their uncle Gustav Weil, who heads the Brotherhood, a vigilante group trying to stamp out vampirism. But their methods are random and misplaced and the only result is a terrorised populace. The real threat lies with Count Karnstein, and although the twins seem outwardly to be identical, Frieda finds herself much more drawn than her sister to the Count's castle dominating the skyline.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The Gellhorn twins, Maria [Mary Collinson] and Frieda [Madelaine Collinson] have journeyed from Vienna to Karnstein in order to live with their aunt and uncle, Gustav [Peter Cushing] and Cathy [Kathleen Byron] Weil, following the death of their parents.

One of his greatest arch-enemies is Count Karnstein [Damien Thomas], said to practice the black arts and worship the devil, all under protection of the emperor. Karnstein is becoming weary of tedious black masses and bogus manifestations of the devil; he wants the real thing.

She meets with Count Karnstein's carriage and is taken to the castle where he makes her vampire.Meanwhile, Anton Hoffer writes a letter to the church elders complaining about Gustav's burnings. ""By burning,"" Anton scolds, ""you char the body. The soul will only re-create itself in another body and continue with its carnage. Only a stake through the heart or decapitation will end their tormented evil."" For all his knowledge, however, Anton's sister Ingrid [Isobel Black] is found the next day with vampire bites on her neck.Then it happens that Gustav comes across his own niece Frieda vampiring a man. ""The Devil has sent me twins of evil!"" he cries. He sends Frieda off to jail and goes home for Maria. Aunt Cathy will not allow him to take Maria who, at this very moment, is lying upstairs with a cross clasped to her breast. Unfortunately, Maria has a nightmare and drops the cross. Karnstein abducts Maria and switches her with Frieda. While the witch hunters prepare to burn Frieda (actually Maria), Anton goes to see Maria and recognizes Frieda right away. He escapes to warn Gustav who does not believe him.""Hold up the holy cross and see if either of us flinches,"" challenges Anton.When both Maria and Anton pass the test, the puritans storm Karnstein castle to destroy Karnstein and Frieda. Gustav beheads Frieda himself, but Karnstein siezes Maria and threatens to throw her from a balcony. Gustav attempts to behead Karnstein with an ax but he misses; Karnstein axes Gustav instead. As Karnstein watches Gustav die, Anton throws a spear which stakes Karnstein through the heart. Maria is saved. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

An elderly heiress is killed by her husband who wants control of her fortunes. What ensues is an all-out murder spree as relatives and friends attempt to reduce the inheritance playing field, complicated by some teenagers who decide to camp out in a dilapidated building on the estate.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> As murder stigmatises the palatial estate of the sorrowful wheelchair user, Countess Federica Donati, the unscrupulous real estate agent Franco Ventura, and his equally immoral lover, Laura, concoct an ambitious scheme to take over the magnificent property. One little signature remains to fulfil their wildest dreams; however, someone, who is not afraid to stain his hands with blood, is hell-bent on weeding out the competition. Now, as the smell of carnage and quick profit turns the noble lady's kin into animals, there is no turning back. But are they willing to pay with their lives for a bay of blood?—Nick Riganas At a remote mansion overlooking a vast, empty bay lake, Countess Federica (Isa Miranda), wheels herself through her dark, empty house. She sorrowfully looks out her window at the rain when Filippo Donati (Giovanni Nuvoletti), her husband, appears and murders her by wrapping a noose around her neck and kicks her out of her wheelchair. The countess cannot stand on or move her useless legs and is strangled to death. But then Filippo is then murdered by a unseen killer who jumps out at him from behind a curtain, and drags his body away. The presence of a suicide note, stolen from the countess' diary, leads the police to believe that she has killed herself.Several days later, Frank Ventura (Chris Avram), a real estate agent, and his secretary/lover Laura (Anna Maria Rosati) are in bed discussing their plans to take over Countess Federicas property following her murder. They both realized the bay's potential to fetch a large price on the estate market, and they are the ones who have convinced Donati to murder his wife. All that Ventura needs to take control of the bay is Donati's signature on some paperwork, although he does not realize that Donati too has been murdered. Ventura plans to go to his cottage, which adjoins the desired property, to meet with Donati. Laura, jealous of Ventura's obsession with the property, asks to come along. When he tells her to stay put, she complains that he enjoys making her life miserable. Ventura tells Laura about a 'squonk' which is mystical creature who is crafty, but never stops whimpering. Laura understands the analogy and agrees to be patient.Back at the bay, Paolo Foscari (Leopoldo Trieste), an entomologist who owns a small house on the grounds, is hard at work trying to capture an insect. He runs into Simon (Claudio Volonte), a handyman who also lives on the property and makes a living by catching squid in the bay. During their conversation, Foscari suggests that the countess might have been murdered. Very defensively, Simon replies that the police ruled it a suicide. Foscari sarcastically replies that it was a suicide before running off to catch more insects.Meanwhile, four rowdy teenagers, Brunhilda (Brigette Skay), Denise (Paola Rubens), Duke (Guido Boccaccini), and Robert (Roberto Bonanni), arrive at the bay for a day of partying and fun. The trouble-making teens break into Ventura's vacant cottage to steal some liquor and smoke some dope. While Denise and Duke retreat to a nearby bedroom for sex, Robert, makes a fire in the fireplace, while Brunhilda goes swimming in the bay. There, she accidentally discovers the badly decomposed body of Filippo Donati floating under water. In a panic state, she runs out of the water, quickly dresses, and runs back to the cottage to tell the others of her find, only to get chased and attacked by a unseen maniac wielding a large billhook, who catches up to her and slashes her throat. Robert is next when he opens the front door of the cottage after hearing a noise and is whacked in the face with the same billhook. The unseen killer takes a fisherman's spear, and kills both Denise and Duke by impaling them in bed while they are in the middle of sex.As night falls on the bay, Renata (Claudine Auger), Donati's estranged daughter, arrives in a mobile home with her weak-willed husband Albert (Luigi Pistilli), hoping to lay claim to the bay estate. Leaving their two young children asleep in their camper, the couple pay a visit to Foscari and his wife Anna (Laura Betti), a fortune teller and tarot reader with a very supercilious nature. Sitting down for tea, Anna slyly insinuates that the countess' death was probably Renata's father's doing, and that Simon may be the one to inherit the property. Shocked to discover that she has a half-brother, Renata leaves with Albert who tells him that Simon will have to be disposed of.Renata and Albert meet with Simon to talk with him about the countess' death when they discover the badly decomposed body of Donati's in Simon's boat. Simon claims to have only found the body floating in the bay and will inform the authorities. Renata and Albert flee to stop at Venturas cottage hoping to meet with him, but find it apparently deserted. When Albert walks away for a moment, Ventura suddenly appears and attempts to kill Renata. She runs into the bathroom where she discovers the four mutilated, dead bodies of the teenagers. But Renata gets the upper hand by grabbing a pair of scissors, and stabbing Ventura. This is accidently witnessed by Foscari, and when he runs back to his house to call the police, Albert follows him there and strangles him to death. When Anna, hearing the commotion at Ventura's cottage, arrives there and gets decapitated by Renata weilding an rafting axe. Frightened by the aura of violence around him and disgusted with himself for killing an innocent man, Albert tries to persuade Renata to make a run for it. But the murderous Renata tells Albert that she has no intention of giving up when she's so close to inheriting the bay. She also reminds Albert that they still have to kill Simon.Things gets more complicated when Laura shows up at the bay looking for Ventura, when she stumbles into Simon's shack on the bay where he appears and threatens her with a machete. It is revealed by Simon that Ventura hired him to murder Filippo Donati with the promise that Ventura will give him his share of the property and money to leave the country. Simon really is the countess illegitimate son who was supported by his mother all this time and the one who murdered the four teenager after one of them discovered the body of Donati since he was ordered by Ventura not to let Donati's death be made public knowledge until after Simon inherits the bay. Furious at Laura when he finds out that she and Ventura were responsible for Donati murdering his mother, he attempt to kill her too. But at first Laura gets the upper hand by throwing a pot of boiling water on Simon, scalding his face. But he quickly recovers and strangles her with his bare hands.Simon then goes after both Renata and Albert hiding out in the property. But then Albert turns the tables on Simon by impaling him to a wall with the same fisherman's spear Simon used to kill two of the teens. With Simon finally taken care of, Renata and Albert search the countess' house for the missing will which has the listings of beneficiaries. But then Ventura, who was presumed to be dead, shows up and attempts to kill both of them, but is then dealt with by Albert who kills him for good.The next morning, with all the loose ends tied up and the countess will burned, Renata and Albert plan to return home to wait for news of her inheritance of the bay. But in an ironic twist, both Renata and Albert are shot to death by the very own neglected children, who playfully point a loaded shotgun at their parents and shoot them both down. The little girl says to her brother, ""Gee, they sure are good at playing dead, aren't they?"" The sister and brother then run out of the camper to playfully skip some stones by the water."

Coming to the attic room, he enters and sits on the bed. He picks up the nosegay, smelling it and lying down.The light by his bed goes out and he hears rumbling noises from under the floor. Rising and looking at the floorboards, he observes one of them rising up. When it rises several inches, he puts his hand down in the opening to feel around. Suddenly his hand is grabbed by something.

He calls out to her, telling her that he wants to talk to her. He says he will discuss with her father her insolent behavior. Angel disrobes and asks if he likes what he sees. He rebukes her and tells her to cover herself up. She comes close, telling him that they want him to come and participate in their games. He curses her, saying he doesnt ever want to see her there anymore. She curses him, saying that if he wants to see what becomes of his pupils, Mark has already succumbed.Next we see the graveside service for Mark, with Fallowfield reading from the Book of Common Prayers. Angel and her father (Godfrey James) come up behind the others and wait. As Angel concentrates her gaze upon Fallowfield, he is distracted and looks repeatedly at her. The wrapped corpse is lowered into the grave and the final words are spoken. Cathy feels a pain and turns to see Angel looking strongly at her.As people are leaving, Fallowfield follows the Squire, asking to speak with him. Angel and her father also approach to speak to the Squire. Telling Fallowfield to wait in the church, he listens as Angel and her father tell the Squire that Fallowfield demanded that Angel strip and submit to him or she would end up like Mark. They convince him that Fallowfield is guilty and the Squire promises to put an end to it.Returning home through the woods, Cathy feels another pain. She tells Ellen that its nothing serious. Ralph comforts her, calling her  my love.  He turns to go another direction as Cathy rushes to join Ellen, telling her that Ralph spoke of her that way.Cathy is approached by two boys from the coven. One of them is cracking a whip (the same whip that smashed the medicine bottle). They claim they are upset about Mark. She asks if they have seen Ralph. Saying no, the red-haired one runs up to her. She tells him she is picking flowers for Marks grave. He insists that he knows where some large flowers are. She asks where and he offers to show her.They lead Cathy through the woods and along a path. One of the boys jumps down on her, tying a rope around her. She screams, saying they are hurting her. They insist its just a game and take her on. Her screams are heard in the distance by Ralph who is driving a carriage home. He sets off looking for her.They lead her into a clearing where Angel places a crown of thorns and flowers on her. They are joined by other members of the coven. Ralph continues to search for her and call her.Meanwhile Fallowfield is arrested, charged with ravishing Angel Blake and is a suspect in the murder of Mark Vespers. He insists that Squire has made a mistake.The coven leads Cathy to the ruins of an old church where she is summoned to the front to be offered to the furry clawed creature of their worship. All at once Cathy is pushed to the ground by Angel. Pulling up the back of her dress, Cathy is seen to bear the mark of the beast.Ralph happens upon the woodsman Ned Carter (Jason Twelvetrees) who lives in a shanty in the woods. Questioning him about Cathy, Carter tells Ralph he saw a group of young people being led by Angel Blake. He doesnt remember seeing Cathy at all.As members of the coven strike her with flowered branches, one boy approaches and disrobes. Other boys tear the clothing from Cathy, who is horrified. As Cathy is raped, the others look on in approval. After its over, a pair of shears is handed to Angel, who stabs Cathy in the back. Her screams are heard by Ralph.Angel repeatedly stabs Cathy and leaves her to die. Ralph finds her bloody body.Squire leads men with Fallowfield into the barn and begins to question him about the death. He denies it, saying he knows not how the death occurred. They are about to judge him when Ralph comes up carrying Cathys body. Ralph tells them that Angel and her coven did this. Squire orders the Reverend to be released and calls for the men to seek the coven members. Peter approaches and gazes sadly at Cathys body.Peter saddles his steed and rides to the Judges house, telling him how things have deteriorated in the village. The Judge is persuaded to return, telling Peter that he will use undreamed of measures.Margaret (Michele Dotrice) is seen running from a mob of men. They capture her and throw her into a pond as a witch. Hearing their struggles, Ralph approaches just as she is hurled into the water. He demands to know what they have done. Telling him that they have done in a witch, they all seem pleased. He asks how they knew she was a witch. They reply that if she floats, she is a witch. Ralph tells them that if she drowns, they have become her murderers. They become sullen and leave. As Margarets body floats to the surface, Ralph wades in to retrieve her.Back at the house, Ralph tells Ellen that he rescued her from the mob who was trying her as a witch. Margaret stirs and Ellen calls for her to be moved by the fire. She tells Ralph to fetch Cathys bed to put the girl in. As she is cleaning the girl up, Ellen spies the devils mark on her. She shows it to Ralph, who recognizes it.The doctor is summoned but refuses to help, saying she bears the devils mark. Ralph and Ellen insist that she be saved. Ralph suggests that the doctor remove the mark. He says he is not equipped to do so and that it will only regrow. Finally he is convinced to operate.Margaret is tied down and the doctor begins cutting. She cries out but is held down. When the skin is removed, the doctor puts it into a bottle. Ralph insists that it be burned. Ellen remarks that there is no blood. The girl confesses her name is Margaret and that she belongs to the devil. She wants to know why her leg hurts.Margaret is seen recovering. Ralph brings her flowers, telling her that she will soon be well enough to walk as well as he. She tells him she will run away to Angel, who is waiting for her. He tells her that Angel is no longer around and that she doesnt serve Angel anymore. She insists to return but Ralph says the Lord will strike her down. She claims her lord is stronger-that he soon will be. She urges Ralph to join them and serve her master, who grows stronger with each sacrifice. He disgustedly refuses her and leaves.The doctor approaches Ralph, asking about Margaret. He replies that she is a hopeless case, talking about her master the devil. The doctor says that the fiend has been seen around, hobbling on one foot. All at once Ellen cries out that Margaret has run away. They begin searching for her. The doctor realizes that the coven will learn that he was the one who removed the skin and will have it in for him. At that moment Peter rides up on his horse and tells him not to worry. Ralph and Ellen come running back, recognizing that Peter has returned. The Judges carriage pulls up and he emerges as they fill him in on what has been happening.Inside, the doctor shows the Judge the skin he removed from Margaret. The Judge takes it for evidence. Outside he reveals trained dogs that will sniff out the devil. They are given the scent of the skin and begin searching.Margaret runs back to Angel with the dogs trailing her. She calls out for Angel to save her. As she approaches she steps into a large trap. Angel comes and asks what she has done. Margaret confesses that the Edmontons have kept her a week at their farm and removed the skin. When Angel sees that the skin is gone, she tells Margaret that she will leave her to the dogs. Margaret continues to struggle to free herself from the trap.The men with the dogs approach, followed by Ralph and the Judge. Ralph tries to free her from the trap. She slaps him, blaming him for her troubles. The Judge asks her name and wants to know who set the trap for her. The Judge says to bring her along.They tie her up in the barn and the Judge questions her about Angel. He tells her that it was Angel who trapped her. She says they meet anywhere that is hidden. Under threat of the dogs attack she admits that tonight they will meet at the old church. The Judge says that is all he needs to know. She tells him he will be too late and that tonight her master will be strong enough to defeat him.Ralph is seen weeding a garden. He accidently cuts his ankle and begins to peel back his sock to observe the wound. He is horrified to see the devils skin underneath. A raven mocks him as Ralph runs away.Returning to the house, Ralph knocks until Ellen opens the door. She asks about his leg but he tells her not to look. She tells him the Judge will take care of everything in the village. He says they may be coming for him and asks if she is alone. She says Peter went to the village. He reveals that he got the skin from Cathy and goes upstairs.The Squire is talking to the villagers about the situation. The Judge is seen approaching in his carriage. He emerges and says that only those resolved to fight this scourge may accompany them. They leave.Ralph looks out from the attic window and sees the villagers carrying torches. He begins to hear approaching footsteps, which grow louder and louder. He realizes the devil is coming for his piece of skin.The mob arrives at the old church site, where a ceremony is going on around a fire. Angel stands in front of Ralph, who has been brought there to give his flesh. She indicates for the ceremony to begin. Coven members march around the fire as one girl (Yvonne Paul) strips and dances before Ralph, giving him a knife. Angel watches from the side. The Judge and men arrive and hide their torches, watching the ceremony. The Judge calls for the large crucifix/scepter to be uncovered which was brought with them. Angel sees it and cries out. She rushes toward it and is stabbed in the darkness. She falls to the ground.The Judge wields the sword toward the other coven members who begin to cower and retreat. The fiend is seen facing the sword and gradually his devilish face is shown in the darkness. The Judge fearlessly continues pressing the sword toward the devil, who finally backs into the fire and collapses. At that moment, the skin is gone from Ralphs foot. They watch as the fiend burns."
The Panic in Needle Park,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067549/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Follows the lives of heroin addicts who frequent ""Needle Park"" in New York City. This movie is a stark portrayal of life among a group of heroin addicts who hang out in ""Needle Park"" in New York City. Played against this setting is a low-key love story between Bobby, a young addict and small-time hustler, and Helen, a homeless girl who finds in her relationship with Bobby the stability she craves. She becomes addicted too, and life goes downhill for them both as their addiction deepens, eventually leading to a series of betrayals. But, in spite of it all, the relationship between Bobby and Helen endures.—E. Schofield <evescho@cafe.net> It's the upper west side of Manhattan in the area around Sherman Square, which is euphemistically called Needle Park for the propensity of intravenous drug use there. Bobby is a smaller time drug dealer and deludes himself that his own use is not an addiction. Helen is Marco's girlfriend, he one of Bobby's customers. It is through this connection that Bobby and Helen become friends, then more than just friends. Bobby exposes Helen to that drug use. Despite their continual declarations of love to each other and the want to get married, Bobby and Helen, by their actions, are more in love with heroin and the need to get the continual fix. Not having the temperament to keep a steady ""traditional"" job, Helen does whatever she needs to get the money for what has become her $80 per day fix. This fixation on the drugs for both Bobby and Helen may lead to an incompatible set of priorities, especially when the police get involved.—Huggo In New York City, soft-spoken Helen returns to the apartment she shares with her boyfriend Marco after enduring an unhygienic and inept abortion. Although Helen becomes ill from the procedure, Marco is satisfied because he was able to procure the abortion through bartering, and thus did not have to expend any money. When Marco leaves briefly to collect some cash, Bobby, an amiable small-time drug dealer to whom Marco owes money, shows unexpected gentleness and concern for Helen. Soon after, when Helen is hospitalized for profuse bleeding, Bobby sneaks in after visiting hours and tells her that Marco has gone away. Briefly, Helen considers returning to her dysfunctional family in Fort Wayne, Indiana. However, after she is released from the hospital, she moves in with Bobby. As they are walking together, Bobby steals a television out of a parked van and pawns it for money to buy drugs. At his apartment, Bobby declines Helen's invitation to have sex until she feels better. When she awakens to find him taking drugs, he explains that he is not an addict, but only ""chipping.""At Sherman Square, which has been nicknamed ""Needle Park"" because it is a hangout for drug dealers and addicts, Bobby introduces Helen to various acquaintances that make up his social group of drug customers. At a cheap luncheonette, she meets Bobby's older brother Hank, who wears a suit and burgles for a living. In an apartment used by several addicts, Helen witnesses the intricate ritual of ""shooting up"" or preparing and injecting the heroin into a vein, and listens to their discussion of the price and availability of drugs. On the street, Bobby becomes anxious when drugs he has paid for are not in the telephone booth where he is to pick them up. After tracking down the man who sold him the drugs, he is re-directed to look into a trash can. That night his drug-taking renders him unable to make love to Helen.When they are evicted for non-payment of rent, Bobby suggests to Helen that she return home, but she refuses and they move into a sleazier apartment. After Bobby asks her to deliver money to Freddy, one of his suppliers, Helen realizes Bobby has not given her enough money to pay for the drugs and that she will be expected to make up the difference by having sex. While Helen is negotiating with Freddy, Hotch, a policeman on the drug squad, and his partner arrest them. As his partner convinces Freddy to assist them in a sting, Hotch explains to Helen about what it's like when there is a ""panic."" He explains that when the drug supply on the street is low, everyone begins to turn one another into the police, in return for favors. Unexpectedly, Hotch releases Helen without booking her and she returns to Bobby, who begins to use drugs more heavily. While Bobby spends more time sleeping, Helen, who all along has only observed the others, begins to shoot up.Some time later, Bobby is exuberantly playing stick ball with some children, when he passionately kisses Helen and looking into her eyes, realizes she is now using. In his favorite diner, as the drugged Helen sits listlessly beside him, Bobby proposes. Upon hearing the news, Hank asks what they will live on and doubts Bobby's supposition that he can quit drugs. Hank offers Bobby work as a burglar, but Helen rejects the idea, saying instead that she will get a job. However, Helen who has been hired as a waitress, does a terrible job and soon quits. Just before Bobby is to assist Hank in a burglary, he overdoses. With the aid of other users, Helen finds Bobby and helps him through the ordeal, but Hank is angry with Bobby for jeopardizing his plans. Reluctantly, he allows Bobby to assist him on another night, but the theft goes awry and Bobby is arrested. While he is in jail, Helen finds it harder to get drugs and has sex with Hank, in exchange for heroin.When Bobby is released, he and Helen have a big fight, after which Bobby considers moving to the country, but they agree that it is not feasible. Bobby persuades Santo, a major drug dealer, to let him handle distribution in Needle Park, and is directed to an apartment where the heroin is being prepared and bagged. Meanwhile, as they are in need of immediate money, Helen turns to streetwalking. After Bobby distributes Santo's drugs, Needle Park residents are happy to have a reliable source for a while. Bobby tells Helen that he stashed some drugs away as an insurance in case he is arrested, so that he can pay for a lawyer. However, when he finds the drugs missing from his hiding place, he accuses Helen of stealing it. As her health deteriorates from increasing drug use, their relationship suffers. Hotch, who is not surprised to watch her fall from an innocent woman in love to a drug abusing prostitute, keeps an eye on her and, when she is arrested with her john, he asks the arresting officer not to book her, as he needs her for something he is planning.When her mother writes, asking Helen to meet friends who are visiting the city, Helen is reluctant, but dresses up, carefully trying to hide the track marks on her arms. Instead of meeting them, however, she picks up a young virginal customer. When Bobby finds her, he scares the boy away, but then he and Helen begin to laugh. Realizing they have been too serious, they take the ferry to the countryside, where they buy a puppy. On the return trip, they discuss making a fresh start and Helen suggests that they move out of Needle Park, but Bobby refuses and convinces her to go into the men's room to shoot up. When the dog begins to whine, he puts it outside the door. Afterward, Helen discovers the dog missing and finds it just before it falls off the end of the ferry and into its machinery.Desolate, she goes to see Marco, who is back from his trip, but soon returns to Bobby and steals drugs from him. Needing a ""fix,"" she goes to a doctor, falsely claiming she needs drugs for a painful kidney stone. Aware that she is an abuser, the doctor refuses to write a prescription for her, but gives her some samples, telling her never to return. She takes some of the pills, but is arrested for selling the rest to minors. Hotch warns her about the dangers of the women's prison and knowing that Bobby can lead them to Santo, offers to arrange for the charges to be dropped if she will help them to catch Bobby in the act of picking up a drug shipment. When she refuses, Hotch explains that she will go to jail for one to three years, but Bobby, who knows how to work the system, will probably only serve six months. Later, at home, Bobby elatedly tells her that there will be no more ""panic"" after the new shipment arrives, saying that Santo is giving him as much as he can sell, and is allowing him to have people work under him.In the next two weeks, Hotch approaches Helen several times, reminding her of the pending trial. Depressed, she increases her drug use and spends days in bed, until even Bobby is annoyed. Helen finally agrees to help the police and late one night Helen and Hotch watch, as a squad of policemen apprehend Bobby, who is in possession of a large quantity of heroin. Spotting her on the street and feeling betrayed, Bobby yells, ""I was gonna marry you!"" Months later, when he is released, Helen waits for him at the gate. Although his first impulse is to rebuff her, he calls to her and they walk off together.[4]"

A chic, good-looking and suitably 70's couple arrive at an extravagant and deserted seaside hotel after eloping. Stefan is wealthy and happily English, with a hidden streak of sadism, while Valarie is intelligent but of inferior (Swedish) blood. To keep her with him at the eerie hotel he lies consistantly about his relationship with his mother and his plans to tell her of their marriage. Meanwhile he has mysterious phone conversations with an older, dominant and pampered sissy. Two fresh guests arrive; the Hungarian countess, Elizabeth Bathory and her voluptuous protege, Ilona. Virgin corpses begin showing up about the city drained of their blood. A wary detective lurks around the hotel taunting his only suspect, the Countess.—kwedgwood@hotmail.com Two days after getting married in Switzerland, Valerie and Stefan Chilton travel by train to take a boat to England to visit Stefan's mother at the Chilton Manor. However, the train has to stop in Ostend and the couple lodges in the royal suite at a seaside hotel. The concierge Pierre advises that the place is empty since it is out of season and they become aware of three murders in Bruges. On the same night, the Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Báthory arrives in the hotel with her secretary Ilona Harczy and Pierre swears that she had been in the hotel forty years ago with the same appearance. When Valerie and Stefan cross the path with the mysterious countess, their lives are affected by the woman. Meanwhile a retired detective snoops at the hotel suspecting that the countess may be the serial-killer that drains the blood of the victims to use as elixir of youth.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory didn't die in 1613 walled up in her castle. She is still alive over 350 years later and still preying on young girls for their blood. Elizabeth (Delphine Seyrig) and her secretary Ilona Harxzy (Andrea Rau) have arrived at a hotel in Ostend, Belgium. Concierge Pierre (Paul Esser) is astonished to see the Countess again. He last saw her 40 years ago when he was but a young bellboy, and she hasn't changed a bit. It is winter, and the only other hotel guests are a newlywed couple, Stefan (John Karlen) and Valerie (Danielle Ouimet) Chilton, who are en route from Switzerland to England, where Stefan's mother lives. Elizabeth comments to Ilona that Stefan and Valerie are perfect, and they take the adjoining suite. Stefan is having a hard time telling his mother about his marriage. He makes one excuse after another when pressed by Valerie, even going so far as to ask Pierre, in front of Valerie, to put through a call to his mother while slipping Pierre a note that says, ""Say there is no reply."" Stefan is not anxious to get back to England and finds reason to hang around Ostend for another day or two or three.No one can go to Belgium without visiting Brugge, walking among its medieval buildings and taking a boat ride on its many canals. Stefan and Valerie are no different. While boating along, they make a stop where they find a crowd gathered outside of a building and an ambulance arriving. Wanting to know what is going on, they join the crowd and learn that a young girl has been murdered, her throat slit and all the blood drained from her body. And she wasn't the first. Three other girls have been similarly murdered in the past week. As the body is carried from house to ambulance, a strange look overcomes Stefan, who strains to get a look at the dead girl and hits his wife in the face when she suggests that they leave. This is a side of Stefan that Valerie hasn't seen before, and it scares her, especially when he and Elizabeth start talking about the history of the Bathorys, and Stefan seems positively mesmerized by Elizabeth's description of how she tortured the servant girls. To make matters worse, after Stefan finally does call his ""mother"", he suddenly starts beating Valerie with his belt. The next day, Valerie decides to leave Stefan, packs her bags, and goes to the train station. Just as the train is about to leave, Elizabeth shows up and convinces Valerie to give it another try. You can't give up after just a few days, she advises.Unfortunately, while Valerie was trying to run away, Ilona seduced Stefan, which wasn't too difficult. After they have sex, Stefan takes a shower. When he tries to pull Ilona under the running water, she screams as though in pain and grabs a straight-edged razor. In the tussle that follows, Ilona drops the razor and then falls on top of it, killing herself instantly. Just at that moment, Elizabeth and Valerie walk in the bathroom to find their naked bodies lying on the floor. Valerie has given up loving Stefan. Elizabeth doesn't seem upset at all about losing her companion. Her primary concern is what to do with the body. They take the body to the shore, where Stefan digs a deep hole. Elizabeth tosses in the body a bit prematurely, pinning Stefan under it, and the sides of the hole start caving in, burying Stefan along with Ilona. Fortunately, Valerie still cares enough to grab Stefan's hand and pull him out.Unknown to Stefan, Elizabeth has also been seducing Valerie with her kisses. When the three of them return to the hotel, Valerie chooses Elizabeth over Stefan. Now it's Stefan's turn to be jealous. He starts packing his clothes and orders Valerie to pack, too, but she refuses, so he slaps her around a bit more.

Two-Lane Blacktop,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067893/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"While drag-racing through the American Southwest in a Chevrolet 150, a driver and his mechanic cross paths with an enigmatic hitchhiker and the tall tale-spinning driver of a GTO. The Driver and The Mechanic are 2 car freaks driving a 1955 Chevy through the southwestern U.S., looking for other cars to race. They're totally dedicated to their car, and speak with each other only when necessary. At a gas station, the pair (along with a girl who's ingratiated herself into their world) meet G.T.O; a middle-aged man who fabricates stories and. It's decided to have a race to Washington, D.C., where the winner will get the loser's car.—Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> On the dark outskirts of Los Angles on a desolate straight line road, a local outlaw racing event featuring muscle cars of the late 60's and early 70's is unceremoniously busted during a 1/4 mile drag race between a Plymouth Barracuda, and a primer gray '55 Chevy 150. As both cars cross the finish line, local police cruisers are seen heading at speed towards the racers and the onlookers at the staring line. As the Chevy evades authorities, it circles back to the staring line, picks up a passenger, and speeds away into the night while the sound of sirens fade off into the distance. From this getaway the driver and mechanic of the '55 Chevy begin an eastern trek to an undefined destination.A stop at a local park to swap out drag slicks invokes minimal dialogue, and a minimal look into the condition of the Chevy, which looks dusty and tired, but unveils disc brakes and a peculiar fiberglass trunk that detaches entirely from the car. It slowly becomes clear with no dialogue that the Chevy is a heavy duty, highly specialized, racing machine that receives maintenance roadside by the driver, and mechanic who tuned each component themselves. The driver comments on the busted race from the night before:
""That Plymouth had a Hemi with a Torqueflite. I believe we sawed the guy off even if we did loose $200.""The next stop: fuel. Here the audience hears more minimal dialogue between the driver, the mechanic, and gas station attendants, one of which is Richard Ruth, the mechanic who (for the film) constructed the 55 Chevy cars. More information is given about the Chevy, including the engine, transmission, and the meticulous nature of the mechanic tuning is conveyed with introverted valve work and a question to the station attendant:
""anything fast around here?""After departing the gas station, the pair continue east and brake for lunch at a roadside diner. Prior to lunch they are passed on the road by an orange GTO, with a middle-aged driver who is outwardly curious with the prospect of antagonizing the young Chevy occupants before he speeds ahead of the Chevy. Later at the diner, a wayward young girl is seem escaping an old delivery van decorated in a bright colored hippy art mural, she walks the parking lot eyeing the '55 Chevy, and plants herself in the backseat while the driver and mechanic eat lunch. After their meal, the driver and mechanic climb into the car without addressing the girl, start the engine, and continue to head east.The girl attempts to start conversation with the driver and mechanic which ends briefly and awkwardly, as the trio continue east towards Santa Fe, the GTO passes the Chevy again, blaring loud music in contrast to the droning emptiness of the Chevy, and a hand gesture i given by the GTO driver as he speeds past again.Later in Santa Fe the girl spends the afternoon in wanderlust, panhandling locals for change while the driver and mechanic cruise the local scene looking for racing action. Later in the evening the group heads to a local drive-in where the Santa Fe racing scene is in full swing. The driver and mechanic eye a prospective '32 Ford, and after a brief discussion a $300 dollar wager is agreed on for a 1/4 mile race. The race and booty is won by the Chevy, and the trio get a hotel room for the evening. The driver of the '55 Chevy disassociates himself with the mechanic and girl, goes to a few local bars, and returns to the hotel later that evening to a locked door and the sounds of young sex from the mechanic and girl.The following morning GTO picks up a suited hitchhiker with a Texas drawl and a 10 gallon hat. GTO (as he is referred to) talk in circles to the passenger about the GTO, where he came from, and how much performance it has. The hitchhiker is unimpressed and can see through the fabricated story that GTO's tall tales are hiding something deeper. This tension is broken when GTO passes the Chevy (again) as the Chevy is pulled over on the side of a lonely desert highway with the fiberglass clam shell hood open while the mechanic pulls spark plugs.
Mechanic: ""might be a fouled plug.""
Girl: ""I wish we were back in Santa Fe""As the journey continues, the girl is becoming increasingly bored and disaffected by the lack on attention she is getting, which she is not used to. As she laments and complains that she needs to use the restroom, the driver and mechanic decide to stop for gas after running the Chevy ""flat out"" at open throttle to keep the engine conditioned for performance racing.GTO arrives at a gas station, and the '55 Chevy arrives shortly thereafter. Tension between both cars boils over with the Chevy driver ending GTO's tough talk, and challenges him to a race. The distance is to Washington D.C and the wager is pink slips (cars). The mechanic spends a few minutes with GTO going over the route, the rules and procedures for mailing the car titles.
Mechanic: ""Ill do that part for you, I've done it before.""With the race officially on the driver and mechanic depart behind GTO and begin to plan for stops and weather. GTO starts the race by picking up another hitchhiker (after the first hitchhiker left at the gas station, presumably annoyed with GTO's talk. The new hitchhiker is heading to Oklahoma City. As another GTO lead conversation begins with false stories of the GTO being a ""test car"" from Detroit, the second hitchhiker asks if he can stretch out, which leads to him making homosexual advances to GTO, which GTO rejects.Rain begins for both parties as the Chevy is mired by archaic windshield wipers, the GTO is mired by the continual sexual advances of the hitchhiker. GTO eventually kicks the hitchhiker out on a rainy evening, and it pulled over later in the evening by Texas Highway Patrol. The Chevy sees the traffic stop and the pull over to tell the police that the GTO is dangerous, driving 90, and passing traffic on the right. After they hassle the GTO in front of the Troopers, the Chevy pulls away at full throttle, burning rubber in front of the Troopers and GTO, and head to the Oklahoma line before Texas authorities can catch up to them. GTO who is obviously infuriated by this stops the Chevy on the side of the road to yell at them for putting him in that situation. The parties agree to a truce, and trade snack and whiskey while GTO shows the trio a collection of uppers and downers that he takes at his pleasure. The group passes time together, as GTO tells the girl that the guys are not for her, the driver and mechanic glance at the GTO's 455 engine and tell GTO that his carburetor has a leak that could be dangerous. GTO, knowing that he cannot fix it himself laments that he is screwed to complete the race, while the trio in the Chevy agree to accompany him to the next town to get it fixed. GTO decides to ride in the Chevy with the driver while the mechanic and the girl ride in the GTO and listen to 8 tracks.During this portion of the trip GTO seems to break into another story about his past (being a television producer and getting laid off) which almost seems believable before the driver cuts him off.
Driver: ""I don't want to hear about it. Its not my problem.""The group drives all night and arrives at a closed Mobil station in a sleepy, rainy town. As the group waits, each has a task:Driver: rest, look for food
Mechanic: steal local license plate (they get nervous with California plates in the south)
GTO: use the restroom, drink whiskey, try to steal local licence plate
Girl: Run awayThe driver finds the girl hitchhiking by the interstate and takes her to a field to try to teach her how to drive. The driver is not a good teacher and the girl is disinterested, the lesson devolves into forced kissing.Back at the gas station the mechanic is asleep in the drivers seat of the GTO, while GTO is drunkenly passed out on the bumper of a shop truck which he was trying to steal a license plate from. A gas station attendant arrives for work seeing this scene, and calls the city police.
During the call to police the driver shows up in the Chevy with the girl as the rain clears and the faint sound of children playing in the background begins.Driver: ""It must be Saturday.""The driver and the mechanic get the drunkenly unconscious GTO in the car while a police cruiser arrives at the gas station. The driver and mechanic slowly drive away as the police begin to follow.Mechanic: ""I'll me you on the south of town on a dirt road.""
Driver: ""Okay, throw me my shirt.""The pair break off in different directions as the police begin to follow the mechanic in the Chevy. The Chevy outruns the police while the driver visits a local parts store for a carburetor rebuild kit. The mechanic and driver meet as planned, repair the gas leak for a still unconscious GTO, and drive off without him, continuing the race.GTO sobers up and races to catch up with the Chevy, which finds them eating lunch discussing racing as they are now broke from using all of their Santa Fe cash, while they discuss particulars a local southerner sits down with them and challenges them to a local race. The interaction is tense and condescending while the local boys accuse them of being hippies. GTO smooths over the interaction by assuring the locals that the driver and mechanic, which have long California hair are ""hometown boys"". The locals buy this, and summarily leave them alone.On their way to the dragstrip both the cars have odd interactions with hitchhikers and antagonizing muscle cars including the Chevy losing control to avoid an already fatal car wreck, and the GTO picking up a old woman and young girl who's parents were killed by an out-of-state driver.Upon arrival at Lakeland drag strip the Chevy begins time trial runs at the packed venue, while GTO and the girl tour the scene. The Chevy makes a wager with a local racer with a C2 Corvette using the mechanics tools as collateral. Later in the evening the Chevy wins this race while GTO and the girl make a break for D.C.The driver and mechanic take their winnings and quickly leave in hope to find the girl, rather than GTO. They catch up and pass the GTO at a diner, but the mechanic is reluctant to tell the driver because he knows the driver is becoming obsessive with winning the girl. Once the Chevy returns to the diner, the driver make one last attempt to win the girl over by proposing Columbus, Ohio as a post-race destination. The girl refuses, grabs her bags out of the GTO, and departs on the back of a strangers motorcycle who she has no spoken a single word to.Upon her departure a 454 El Camino arrives at the diner and challenges the Chevy to a race. The driver accepts as GTO leaves, saying his last words to the driver and mechanic.GTO: ""See ya.""GTO picks up two young GI's heading to New York City on liberty, the GI's compliment the car, and are eager to hear about GTO's adventures. GTO claims that he won the GTO by driving a '55 Chevy across country and beating the GTO by 4 hours. GTO puts himself in the story as the driver and mechanic and states""
GTO: ""There's nothing like building an automobile from scratch and wiping out one of these Detroit machines. Those satisfactions are permanant.""In the final scene we see the Chevy and the El Camino poised for launch on an old runway. The mechanic dials in the ignition advance, the driver straps in, and the race begins.During this race the film becomes shaky as it burns into the projector freezing the race in time before going to credits."
Countess Dracula,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065580/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 17th-century Hungary, elderly widow Countess Elisabeth Nádasdy maintains her misleading youthful appearance by bathing in the blood of virgins regularly supplied to her by faithful servant Captain Dobi. In medieval Europe aging Countess Elisabeth rules harshly with the help of lover Captain Dobi. Finding that washing in the blood of young girls makes her young again she gets Dobi to start abducting likely candidates. The Countess - pretending to be her own daughter - starts dallying with a younger man, much to Dobi's annoyance. The disappearances cause mounting terror locally, and when she finds out that only the blood of a virgin does the job, Dobi is sent out again with a more difficult task.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The old and evil Countess Elisabeth Nodosheen uses blood sacrifice to bath with the blood of virgin women and restore her beauty and youth helped by her servant Julie Sentash and her former lover, Capt. Dobi the Castle Steward. When she meets the young Lt. Imre Toth, she pretends to be her daughter Ilona to marry him, for the despair of Dobi. But when Illona returns home to visit her mother, Julie that was her former nanny has to decide what to do to protect her.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Count Nodosheen has died, and all have gathered to hear the reading of his will. To Julie Sentash [Patience Collier], the castle nurse, he leaves 1,000 koronas and food and lodging for the rest of her days. To Master Fabio [Maurice Denham], the castle historian, he leaves his library. To Lt Imre Toth [Sander Eles], son of his old army companion, he leaves his stable, horses, and cottage. To his aging wife Elisabeth [Ingrid Pitt], he leaves his estate to be shared equally with their only child Ilona. And to Captain Dobi [Nigel Green], the castle steward, he leaves his arms and uniforms. Dobi isn't pleased with his bequeathal after 20 years of service, but there is one thing he's happy about. After 20 years as the Countess's secret lover, Dobi finally has her to himself. Not that the Countess is equally as happy to have Dobi, for she is too distracted by young Imre's good looks and youthful manhood.However, there is much to do. Ilona, who has lived in Vienna since she was six years old and is now a grown woman of 19 years, is returning to the castle on the morrow. The Countess, who is not known for her kindness, is preparing to bathe, when she notices that chambermaid Teri [Susan Brodrick] has made the bathwater too hot. After chastizing Teri, Elisabeth requests a peach. The frightened maid, in slicing the peach, also slices herself. Some of her blood spills on the Countess' face, and Elisabeth later notices that she looks much younger. Dobi is astonished at the change in Elisabeth, but he won't go so far as to bring Teri to her, so Elisabeth goes to Teri. The next morning, Teri is missing, and Elisabeth looks half her age. Knowing that her daughter is due to arrive and not wanting any competition, Elisabeth arranges to have Ilona [Lesley-Anne Down] kidnapped en route and held captive in a cabin in the woods with only the mute old gamekeeper Janco [Peter May] for companionship. That evening at dinner, Elisabeth presents herself as her daughter, saying that her mother is not feeling well. Imre is smitten with her beauty and so starts the love affair between Ilona/Elisabeth and young Imre...much to Dobi's dismay.Two nights the lovers spend in each other's arms, and Elisabeth has never been happier. Then, sometime during the second night, she suddenly reverts to her old self (literally). Knowing that Elisabeth must have the blood of another girl, Julie invites a gypsy girl [Nike Arrighi] into the castle to read Elisabeth's fortune and become her next victim. And so it goes. Imre courts Ilona/Elisabeth, Julie finds fresh blood every few nights, and Dobi seethes in jealousy. Imre, utterly obsessed with Elisabeth, asks her to marry him. Elisabeth says yes.Dobi has had enough. He wants his Elisabeth back and decides to set Imre up. Dobi and Imre go drinking together one night, and Dobi arranges for Ziza [Andrea Lawrence], the pub whore, to accompany Imre home and sleep with him. Dobi makes Elisabeth watch. Elisabeth decides to use Ziza's blood when she suddenly turns old again, but it doesn't work. Master Fabio, who is beginning to catch on, informs them that it must be the blood of a virgin, so Dobi buys the plainest girl he can find, thinking she could only be a virgin. Elisabeth's beauty restored, she begins to make plans for the wedding.Meanwhile, Ilona has a plan to escape her captivity. She pretends to offer herself to the mute. While he is slobbering over her, Ilona steals the key from his pocket and gets away...only to fall into a stream where he catches her and carries her back. Fabio is getting wise, so Dobi has him hanged. Then Dobi takes Imre to Elisabeth who confesses her real identity. Imre is appalled, but Elisabeth assures him that he will be charged with the whore's murder if he should leave her, so there is no escape for him. Plus, the chief bailiff sends away all the serving girls and sequesters the castle until Fabio's killer can be found. With all the girls gone, Elisabeth has no virgins at hand, so she pleads with Dobi to sneak a girl into the castle for when needed. Dobi promises to do so, but the girl he brings is Elisabeth's own daughter, the real Ilona. When Julie finds out that Ilona, the child she nannied since birth, is to be the next sacrifice, she can tolerate Elisabeth's depravities no longer. She introduces Imre to Ilona and tells him that he must get Julie away. They make plans for Julie to free Ilona tomorrow during the wedding ceremony.It is the day of the wedding. Elisabeth is radiant. Imre is resolved to his fate. As the ceremony begins, Julie fetches Ilona and leads her to escape. But Ilona hears the music and the priest's voice and refuses to go until she's had a peek. As Ilona watches, Elisabeth suddenly turns old, shocking the priest. Elisabeth runs out, looking for she who is to be the next victim. Imre tries to stop her, but he is stabbed and killed by the knife being carried by Elisabeth herself. Elisabeth is subsequently imprisoned and known thereafter by the villagers as Countess Dracula, devil woman. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

The story of British serial killer John Christie, who committed most or all of his crimes in the titular terraced house, and the miscarriage of justice involving Timothy Evans. London, 1949.John Christieis an unassuming, middle-aged man who, along with his wife Ethel, lives in the ground-floor flat at 10 Rillington Place. His demeanor masks the fact of being a serial killer. His modus operandi is to act as a person with a medical background, lure unsuspecting women to his apartment on the pretense of curing them of some ailment, knock them unconscious with carbon monoxide gas, gain his sexual release through contact with the unconscious body, then strangle the victim dead before disposing of the body somewhere in the house or outside area. His next intended target is Beryl Evans, a young woman who has just moved into the top flat in the house. Beryl's husband, Tim Evans, is an illiterate man who likes to put on airs. Already with an infant daughter named Geraldine, the Evanses learn they are going to have another baby, which they cannot afford to have, nor can they afford to abort the pregnancy. This problem, on top of the constant issue of lack of money in all aspects of their lives, places a strain on the marriage, of which all their neighbors are aware through the constant fighting they overhear. Christie will offer to perform the abortion for free. The difference with this intended murder is that Tim will be aware that his wife will have died, but Christie plans either to goad Tim into keeping silent since the abortion would have been illegal, an act to which Tim would have provided his consent, or pin the murder on Tim who would have motive. Will this change in modus operandi affect Christie's ability to kill Beryl, or kill her without detection?—Huggo The case of Timothy Evans generated much controversy and is acknowledged as a major miscarriage of justice.

Blood from the Mummy's Tomb,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068290/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An archaeological expedition brings back to London the coffin of an Egyptian queen known for her magical powers. Her spirit returns in the form of a young girl and strange things start to happen. On the night before her anniversary, Margaret Fuchs receives an ancient Egyptian ring with a red stone as a birthday gift from her father, Prof. Julian Fuchs. Margaret has frequent nightmares about an expedition in Egypt with five members, including her father, finding the tomb of Queen Tera, an evil sorcerer with a severed hand. The members collect the sarcophagus with a totally preserved mummy, the severed hand with the ring with a red stone, and three relics. Margaret is possessed by the spirit of Tera and chases the expedition members to retrieve the objects and gives life back to Tera.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A group of Egyptologists discover the tomb of an evil queen. When the girl born to the wife of the expedition's leader at the moment of the discovery grows up it becomes evident she has inherited the beauty and the soul of the mummy. This strikes terror into almost all the expedition's members and for good reason, as they are one by one gruesomely murdered. Despite this, one of their number is intent on exploiting this frightening power.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Margaret Fuchs (Valerie Leon) is in bed dreaming: in an ancient Egyptian tomb some priests are burying Queen Tera (also Valerie Leon) who looks like Margaret. As part of the ritual they chop her hand off, take it outside and throw it to the jackals. They go back into tomb and place the lid on the sarcophagus. Outside, a jackal dies on the ground with its throat ripped and bloody as the hand crawls away. As the priests leave the tomb a sandstorm appears and they all die with lacerated throats too. The severed hand crawls away. Margaret awakes from her nightmare. Her father Professor Julian Fuchs (Andrew Weir) comes into bedroom to comfort her. Another man, Corbeck (James Villiers), watches then from the window of an empty house opposite.Next morning the Professor gives Margaret a ring containing a large ruby. She puts it on showing she has a scar completely across her wrist before going off with her boyfriend Tod (Mark Edwards) in his sports car, observed again from by Corbeck from opposite.In a mental hospital two orderlies look at Berrigan (George Coulouris) in his cell which has a desk and some furnishings. He is seeing some lights that look like stars on his carpet.Tod inspects Margaret's ring closely. He thinks it must have come from her father's expedition. Tod says he will take it to a friend who can give them more information.At the mental hospital, Corbeck visits Berrigan. He tries to take an ornamental cobra from the wardrobe but Berrigan attacks him and the orderlies intervene and make him leave.Tod and Margaret visit expert Geoffrey Dandridge (Hugh Burden) to show him the ring but when he sees Margaret he collapses. Star-like lights appear in the ring.Fortune teller Helen Dickerson (Rosalie Crutchley) is looking into her crystal ball to read a fortune for her customer but sees the same star-like lights too. She is alarmed and asks the customer to leave.Later, at the end of the day, Geoffrey sends his assistant home then goes to a cupboard and takes out and opens a box containing a jackal's skull. Corbeck arrives and Geoffrey explains that he has seen a woman with the ring. Corbeck explains to Geoffrey she is Margaret Fuchs, daughter of Professor Fuchs, and it will soon be her birthday and soon be time.That night Margaret dreams again about the soul of Queen Tera living all these years while her mortal body has waited. Her time is drawing near and it was she who guided people to her tomb to find her. In a flashback, explorers Professor Fuchs, Geoffrey, Corbeck, Berrigan and Helen Dickerson enter Queen Tera's tomb. Around the tomb are several ornaments around including one of a cobra snake, the skull of jackal, and a cat. They open the sarcophagus and see Queen Tera's body with the hand severed. The hand is on the floor next to the sarcophagus with the red ruby ring on a finger. The Professor takes the ring off and from its inscriptions identifies the queen as Tera. At the exact same time, Mrs Fuchs is in hospital giving birth to baby but she dies in the process. The baby at first appears to be stillborn but then doctors hear its heart start beating. The severed arm of Queen Tera in the sarcophagus starts bleeding fresh blood. Margaret wakes up from her dream and tells Tod she must leave immediately.In the basement of his house Professor Fuchs opens the sarcophagus and looks at Queen Tera's body. Margaret and Tod arrive, observed by Corbeck opposite, but there is an ominous feeling and sound from the basement. They break down the door to the basement and rush to the Professor who has cuts on his neck. He instructs them to call Doctor Putnum (Aubrey Morris). They put the Professor in bed but he is unresponsive. Doctor Putnum says the Professor will be like that for a few days and cannot reveal much about Professor's wishes other than his work would astound the world of science.That night Margaret goes to the basement and looks at Queen Tera's body. Corbeck arrives and explains the ruby is the symbol of the god to come. The Professor life's work was to discover the legend of the queen and find the truth, and he and Corbeck and their team searched for her tomb together. There was an attack on one of their members in tomb and fresh blood from Tera's wrist at exactly the same time Margaret was born in the image of Tera. Tod arrives and they agree Tera has some kind of astral power which will be directed against them if they don't understand it. They agree they must contact all old members of team to help reunite Tera with her soul.Tod and Margaret visit Berrigan at the mental hospital. When he sees Margaret he is frightened. Margaret realises he thinks she is Tera so she pretends to be Tera and asks for her familiar - her snake. He says he has not got it, then breaks down causing the orderlies to enter and restrain him and Tod and Margaret have to leave.Back home, Putnum is checking on the Professor. He is still unconscious and the doctor says there will be some paralysis on one side. He says the Professor wanted to protect her from the artefacts in the basement.Tod reads the Professor's journal. The simultaneous events of the Professor entering the tomb and Margaret's birth were a unity created by Tera. Tera had prepared for an abstract metaphysical state by lying in her sarcophagus, creating an astral body with freewill and a conscious intelligence. He believes this power could be used to keep people alive for a long time in suspended animation. Margaret says she feels Tera is dreaming of loneliness, of ancient land and times, when love was a divine possession.In the mental hospital that night the orderlies tease Berrigan with the cobra then leave it on the desk where he can see it when they leave. He struggles in his strait-jacket then goes still and listens. Suddenly the snake disappears from the desk and he sees its shadow approaching him. The window bursts open and wind blows everything around but he cannot escape. The snake approaches and strikes him. He dies with his cuts to his throat.The next morning the Professor wakes up. Margaret explains he had a terrible shock. She asks about the ring and why would it protect her. The Professor explains the priest severed it because they thought it was source of her evil. She says Berrigan is dead and the snake has appeared in their basement. She mentions Corbeck but the Professor implores her not to have anything to do with him. She asks where Tera's hand is but he cannot answer. Out of the window she sees Corbeck going into house opposite and she goes across to confront him. They argue over the facts but she says they need her and she is interested in the power that she may now have. Corbeck says Tera is beyond good and evil and they need to understand her. He says the relics from her tomb are needed for her resurrection from the dead, to provide power over life and death. He says her father is weak and cannot be a part of it. She says she will do anything to have the power so Corbeck says they will do it together.At Geoffrey's, his assistant tells him about Berrigan's death as she leaves at the end of the day. He realises that the jackal skull is significant and takes it out. Margaret arrives and says she wants the skull. He panics and tries to escape out of the window and down the fire escape but he drops the box. As he looks for it he hears a jackal call. He flees in fright.Tod arrives wondering what is going on. Margaret will not tell him anything and leaves. He looks around and hears the jackal call from outside. He investigates, going down the fire escape where he finds the empty box that housed the skull. Hearing noises then a scream he finds Geoffrey's body with the throat lacerated and bloody. He sees the shadow of a jackal running away.Margaret looks at Tera's body in the sarcophagus. The wrist is still bleeding fresh blood. Corbeck arrives and together they see that both the cobra and the jackal's skull are now present in the basement. Tod arrives and tries to stop Corbeck and Margaret. When they refuse he drives away to get help. Margaret screams wishing Tod dead. Tod crashes his car into a tree, his throat lacerated and covered in blood. She is frightened but Corbeck says she must not weaken and she is coming of age. Margaret collapses to the floor.The Professor staggers down to the basement and sees Margaret lying on the floor. Corbeck explains that Margaret no longer exists and soon Tera will be reborn and the Professor cannot do anything to stop it. Corbeck leaves to get the final artefact, the third and final phase of Tera's soul.Margaret dreams in bed watched by the Professor and Doctor Putnam. The Professor insists Putnum give her an injection to ensure she will not wake but while he is preparing it she wakes up. He tries to convince her to go back to bed but she uses her willpower to kill him. He dies with a lacerated throat like the others and Margaret flees. The Professor returns to find Putnum's body, then Corbeck arrives and helps the Professor move the body downstairs. Corbeck says they need each other and they control Tera not the other way around. Corbeck knows where Margaret has gone.Margaret arrives at Helen Dickerson's house. She is afraid and tries to strike Margaret but cannot do so. Instead she concedes and gives Margaret the statue of the cat. As Margaret leaves, she uses her willpower again to kill Helen. Corbeck arrives and sees Helen's body. Margaret reappears at the door and tells Corbeck to come.The Professor finds the scroll of life in the basement then sees that the statue of the cat has appeared. He looks at the severed hand in its box, then Margaret and Corbeck arrive. Corbeck takes the severed hand and places it back in the sarcophagus next to the wrist. The Professor implores him not to read the scroll saying Tera has abused her power and to wait, but Margaret says she is ready and where there is good there must be the opposite. Corbeck reads the scroll of life, to reunite Tera's soul and body and rekindle her astral spirit. The hand reattaches itself to the wrist. Margaret says to the Professor it was Tera that lead them to the tomb. The Professor realises Tera is in Margaret and Corbeck must not finish scroll. They stab Corbeck to death with some relics but Tera awakes. They try to kill her too but she kills the Professor first. Margaret manages to stab her but the building collapses in on top of them all.In a hospital, the medical staff have no idea who the woman all bandaged in the bed is. Her eyes open wide but cannot speak clearly from underneath all the bandages."

Blissful newlyweds Isle and Antoine stop off at a decrepit old castle in rural France to visit the bride's estranged cousins, only to receive shocking news. However, the distraught couple decides to spend the night in the gloomy, stone-walled manor, and soon, the suspiciously warm hospitality of two eerily seductive maids paves the way for mysterious incidences and spine-chilling encounters. Then, the missing lords of the château turn up for dinner, and the truth becomes stranger than fiction. Now, a pale late-night temptress claiming to be a friend thirsts for Isle's kiss, eager to unveil the secret of eternal life. Is sweet death the doorway to the ultimate freedom?—Nick Riganas Isle and Antoine are newlyweds on their way to visit Isle's last
remaining relatives -- two cousins. Upon their arrival to the town, they
learn that the two cousins died just yesterday. Isle and Antoine go on to
the chateau anyway, where they are greeted by two female renfields who
show them to a room.The castle is a strange place -- filled with skulls, candles, and
weird figurines. Isle decides that she must go to the cemetery to pay her
respects to her dead cousins. While there, she meets Isabelle who says
that she was about to be wed to both of the cousins. Isle is so upset by
the deaths that she chooses to sleep alone on her wedding night. As she
gets into her nightgown, the grandfather clock suddenly opens up, and a
woman comes out. She introduces herself as Isolde and takes Isle back to
the cemetery where Isolde bites Isle in the neck.Antoine, feeling lonely and horny, goes to his wife's chamber, only
to find her bed empty. He searches the castle grounds for her and comes
upon a chapel where what appears to be a human sacrifice is taking place.
Two of the participants (who turn out to be Isle's cousins) explain that
the woman must be killed or she will become like them -- the undead.
Antoine goes back to Isle's room and this time finds her in bed. He's
uncertain whether or not it's all been a dream.The next morning Isle and Antoine are served breakfast by the
renfields who tell them that the story about the cousins' death is not
true and that they are, in fact, working right now in the library. Antoine
goes to the library where, instead of finding the cousins, he is knocked
out when all the books start jumping off the shelves. When he comes to,
Antoine stumbles into the dining room where he is attended to by Isle and
finally meets the two cousins. Antoine asks them about their work. They
explain that they have been researching their family's origins, including
the roots of certain ancient and medieval religions. That night, Isle again tells Antoine that she wants to sleep alone.
Antoine gets angry and says that he's not going hang around this crazy
house much longer. Isle sleeps alone, until Isolde joins her and bites her
neck a second time.Meanwhile, Isabelle is recounting to a friend the nature of her
relationship with the two cousins. Apparently, they were once vampire
slayers who were bitten by vampires and died of blood loss. That evening,
Isolde summons Isabelle to the chateau where she learns that the two
cousins are still alive but under Isolde's control. Isolde also tells
Isabelle that she is no longer welcomed at the chateau, then grabs her in
a big bear hug, piercing Isabelle's breasts with two pointed cones which
Isolde is wearing on her nipples. Angry with Isolde for killing Isabelle,
the two cousins rape Isolde.Antoine is sleeping alone again. The renfields come to awaken him by
crawling into bed with him in order to awaken him ""naturally"" after his
long period of abstinence. When Antoine awakens, the renfields run away
laughing. Antoine follows them to the chapel where he sees a ceremony
about to take place that involves the cousins, Isolde, Isle, and the
renfields. When Antoine breaks open the door, however, everyone
disappears. Not certain whether this was also a dream, Antoine runs to
Isle's bed and tells her that they must escape. Isle says no -- that her
two cousins are the only family she has left, so they stay the night, Isle
in her bed and Antoine on the couch.The next morning, Antoine throws open the curtains, and Isle cries
out that the light hurts her eyes. When Antoine shoots a bird, Isle laps
at the blood. Isle goes to Isolde's coffin. Isolde speaks to her from
within the coffin, telling her that the sunlight will kill her if the
coffin lid is lifted and then Isle will be alone. The other alternative is
for Isle to not open the coffin, in which case she will become like Isolde
and live forever. Isle chooses not to open the coffin.Tonight is to be Isle's initiation -- when she will be given the
final 'kiss' and made vampire. Antoine attempts to break up the ceremony
and carries Isle away. The two cousins follow them to a beach. It will
soon be light. Isolde tries to slip into her coffin but finds it on fire.
The renfields place a crucifix on the tomb door, sealing Isolde inside.
Isolde bites her own wrist and, for some reason, dies. Back on the beach,
Antoine is begging Isle to go with him, but she joins her two cousins
instead and, together, they await the sunrise. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

What has happened in the opera house?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Roberto Tobias (Michael Brandon) plays the drums for a local Rome rock and roll band when at various time, he sees a man in dark sunglasses wearing a suite and tie, watching him. After the session, Roberto sees the man and follows him through the dark streets to an apparently abandoned opera house where he confronts the man and asks him why he's been following him for the past several weeks. The man declines such actions and pulls a knife on Roberto when the drummer gets too close. In the struggle, the man is accidentally stabbed and he falls from the stage to the lower level. Suddenly a spotlight is turned onto Roberto and a masked person on the balcony snaps some photos of Roberto holding the bloody knife.That night, Roberto returns home and lies in bed awake as his wife Nina (Mimsy Farmer) lies beside him. The next day, Roberto reads the newspaper describing the dead man and he receives a letter containing the identification of a certain Carlo Marosi, the man who Roberto stabbed. That evening at a get-together of several band members and friends at his house, one of the guests talks about beheading executions in Saudi Arabia, and Roberto looks through some record albums and sees the photos of the incident. Amelia (Maria Fabbri), the maid, sees him and the photos, but does not tell him that she knows. That night, Roberto has a disturbing dream about him being beheaded in a coliseum in Saudi Arabia when he wakes up after hearing a noise. Roberto looks around and a cord is wrapped around his neck. The masked person tells Roberto, he could kill him now, but will not for he is not finished with him, and knocks him out before running away. Nina walks in and asks her husband what is wrong and he finally admits to the accidental stabbing and subsequent harassment, and says that they cannot go to the police.Roberto goes to see Godfrey (Bud Spencer) (whom Roberto's annoys by nicknaming him 'God'). Godfrey is a beat-nick artist living in a shack outside Rome with his colleague, a con-artist known only as the Professor (Oreste Lionello). Roberto confides in them about his problem and Godfrey suggests having the Professor keep an eye on him. Later, Roberto jumps out at a person who approaches his house in the pouring rain and beats him with a stick. But it is only the slow-witted mailman with a special delivery.Meanwhile, Amelia calls someone and says that she knows what the person is doing to Roberto. She wants blackmail money or she'll go to the police. The unseen person has a flashback episode of being committed to a lunatic asylum and being tied down on a bed.Amelia goes to a local park and waits on a bench. As night falls, the park crowd dissipates, and she stands to leave when she hears a person say her name. When Amelia discovers that she is locked inside the park, the runs along the high wall and cries out for help. A couple on the other side hear her, but the man is unable to scale the stone wall. Before he can get to the gate entrance, Amelia screams and is killed by the unseen person who slashes her throat with a straight razor.A little later, Nina arrives at a train station where she picks up her cousin Dalia (Francine Racette) and she joins Roberto's group for another get-together in the house of playing music, smoking dope, and political discussions. Roberto is the only person who does not seem to want Dalia there. Mikro, Roberto's band mate, asks why Roberto did not show up for rehearsals that day. Then Nina gets a phone call and learns that Amelia has been murdered. Roberto later has the same dream of being decapitated again and he wakes up when a noise is heard. He investigates but only hears his pet cat hissing. The next morning, there is note from the killer, and Nina is now frightened.Meanwhile, it is revealed that Carlo Marosi is alive and well, and eating at a local restaurant. Carlo calls someone and asks them to meet at his place... referring to someone being killed. At Carlo's small apartment, he tells the unseen person that what they agreed to in harassing Roberto and mentions the ""toy"" (a knife with a trick blade). Carlo had been approached by the unseen killer to set this whole thing up, but now Carlo wants to back out. But the killer picks up a blunt object and hits Carlo on the head. The unseen killer gets a wire and twists around the man's neck, decapitating him. The killer then disposes of the dead Carlo to make sure he is not found.Elsewhere, the Professor tells Roberto that he saw someone last night in his back garden, with his cat wrapped in a blanket. He tried to stop the person, but got hit on the head. The Professor tells Roberto that he may seek outside help to learn who is harassing him.Roberto goes to meet with Arrosio (Jean-Pierre Marielle), a flamboyantly gay private investigator. After the drummer tells the PI his story, Arrosio admits to never having solved a case, but is optimistic that his bad record will be broken. During a drive with Roberto, Arrosio asks him questions about his life and about Nina, when they met and how long they were married. Roberto mentions Nina getting a big inheritance. After dropping off Arrosio at his apartment, Roberto returns to his house where Nina is leaving town with police officers about the Amelia murder. She tells Roberto that she does not want to stay in the house anymore with someone stalking them. But Roberto decides to stay and invites Dalia over to spend time with him.That evening Roberto takes a bath when Dalia walks in and admits that she has had romantic feelings for him and the two of them make love. Afterwards, Arrosio arrives and is a little surprised to see Roberto with Dalia and that Nina has left. Roberto gives Arrosio some photos of his past and his family as well as Nina's and Dalia's. Then, they find Roberto's pet cat's head and wrapped in plastic. That night, Roberto has his nightmare again about the decapitation execution, and wakes up in a cold sweat. Dalia comforts him.Meanwhile, Arrosio is in his office looking at photos of Roberto's family and friends, as well as some old papers and financial records. He is making notes about his profile of the blackmailer/killer as being someone who acts normal, but hides behind a sane persona. Arrosio is making a list of Roberto's band mates and neighbors as potential suspects, but he is getting frustrated at not making any progress with the case until something catches his eye. He begins looking through more old papers of Roberto's past. A little later that same night, Arrosio phones Roberto to give him an update and tells him that he's found a ""strange physical resemblance"" in one photo, but tells him that it may only be a red herring. Arrosio tells Roberto that he's found the name ""Villa Rapidi"" and asks if anyone ever mentioned it, but Roberto claims to have never heard it before. Arrosio thanks Roberto and hangs up without telling him what it means.The next day, Arrosio arrives at the Villa Rapidi Psychiatric Clinic where a doctor tells the private investigator about a patient that Arrosio is inquiring about (the name and the gender are not mentioned) who stayed there for three years as a teenager, whom was diagnosed as a homicidal maniac. When the father who committed the teenager died from a sudden heart attack, the mental symptoms disappeared overnight and the patient was deemed cured and released. The doctor also suspects that the man who committed the teen and the teen's mother there was not the patient's real biological father.Arrosio talks to various people around Rome looking for the nameless ex-patient from Villa Rapidi. He later visits an estate-turned-boarding-house where he talks to (and flirts with) the landlord about the patient he is looking for. The boarding house is the residence of the killer. Arrosio follows the unseen person from the estate and onto a subway train. He gets off at the person's stop and follows the unseen person to the men's room where the unseen killer attacks him in a stall, and stabs him in the chest with a syringe of a glowing blue poison. The killer leaves, as Arrosio lies dying on the restroom floor. But with a smile on his face and with his last breath, Arrosio mumbles, ""I was right..."".Roberto learns of Arrosio's murder and meets with Godfrey and the Professor at a convention hall where coffins are being sold. Roberto tells them about his nightmares and Godfrey thinks that it might be a premonition of something to come. Godfrey suggests that someone with a grudge against Roberto is trying to drive him crazy and wants him to leave Rome at once. But Roberto refuses, determined to find the killer on his own.A few days later, Dalia calls the studio asking for Roberto, but he is busy recording music with his band. As Dalia packs her suitcase, she notices a strange similarly between a recent photo of Roberto and Nina with some unseen person in another photo. Just then, Dalia hears a noise and is frightened. Dalia slips off her shoes and sneaks up to the attic where she arms herself with a knife and waits as she hears the intruder looking for her. Dalia hides behind a door with the knife when the killer comes inside, then leaves. When Dalia thinks the killer is gone, she steps out of the doorway when a knife hits her on her forehead. Dalia stumbles down the attic stairs and is stabbed to death by the unseen killer.After finding the body, Roberto calls the police and they tell him about a test they will do on Dalia. By removing one of her eyes and shooting a laser through it, they will be able to see the last image that Dalia had seen for the image is retained on the retina for several hours after death. On a computer screen, they see only four dark smudges against a gray background which looks like, as the technician puts it, ""four flies on gray velvet."" The test is declared inconclusive.That night, Roberto loads a gun and sits in his dark home, waiting for the killer to make his move. He nods off and begins dreaming again, and his dream goes all the way with the gory beheading of a criminal in Saudi Arabia. Roberto is woken up when the phone rings and it is Godfrey asking if the drummer is okay. Roberto says that he is, and then the line goes dead. A few minutes later, Nina arrives home from her long getaway and Roberto almost shoots her as she walks through the front door. Roberto puts down the gun and tells her to leave and tries to push her out the front door, when Nina's necklace (a fly enclosed in glass) swings.... giving the appearance of more than one fly, and Roberto pulls her back inside and hits her. Roberto confronts Nina and accuses her of killing Amelia, Arrosio, and Dalia, and the one who terrorized him. Nina grabs Roberto's gun and shoots him the in shoulder.As Roberto lies wounded on the floor, Nina suddenly adopts a sneering, wild-eyed appearance. Nina mechanically laughs and she tells Roberto about her abusive stepfather who placed her in a lunatic asylum when she was little and when he died, her mental condition was cured. But when Nina apparently met Roberto many years later, he reminded her of her late father. So, Nina married Roberto and cooked up this whole event as part of her twisted way of getting back at her father, since Roberto is apparently the dead-splitting image of Nina's late father. Nina shoots Roberto a few more times in his arm and both legs, when Godfrey runs in and Roberto knocks the gun out of Nina's hands. Nina runs to Roberto's car and speeds away. But in a twist of fate, she doesn't look where she is going and rams into the back of a truck, and she is decapitated by the truck's rear bumper as it smashes, in slow-motion, through her car windshield. The car then explodes in a mass of flames."
A Lizard in a Woman's Skin,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067361/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The potentially unhinged daughter of a British politician is accused of killing her hedonistic neighbor after she witnesses the murder in a dream. In London, Carol Hammond lives in a fancy building with her husband Frank and her stepdaughter Joan. Carol is the beloved daughter of wealthy, prominent lawyer and politician Edmond Brighton; Frank is his partner in his office and has a love affair with Deborah. Carol's next-door neighbor Julia Durer is a depraved woman who promotes parties with drugs and orgies. Carol has psychoanalysis sessions with Dr. Kerr and is intrigued with a nightmare where she stabs Julia to death three times while a couple watches. When Julia is found dead in her apartment, efficient Inspector Corvin and his partner Sgt. Brandon are assigned to investigate. All the evidences point out to Carol, but was it a dream or reality?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil London, England. Carol Hammond (Florinda Bolkan) is the daughter of a wealthy lawyer and politician named Edmund Brighton (Leo Genn). Her husband Frank (Jean Sorel) is a lawyer working for Brighton's practice. They all live together in a large apartment with Joan (Edy Gall), Frank's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams shes been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet exite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies.During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst.Carol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations, but may be partly real. Describing her latest one to her psychoanalyst, they depict a lesbian encounter between the two women, culminating in Carol grisly stabbing the seductive Julia to death. In an enigmatic coda to the dream sequence, Carol sees two kaftan-clad hippies (Mike Kennedy and Penny Brown) who have apparently witnessed the whole thing without intervening.The following day, it's revealed that Julia Durer has indeed been murdered. Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) from Scotland Yard arrives to take charge of the investigation. The room and condition of the dead body are identical to their depiction in the dream sequence. To make matters even more incriminating, there is a discarded fur coat near the body. Learning of the murder, Carol insists that she see the scene of the crime and when she enters Julia's apartment and sees the body, she faints.After weeding out a false and self-serving confession from a delirious regular at the Durer parties, Corvin focuses on Carol Hammond. In the meanwhile, Carol, during a shopping excursion with her step-daughter Joan, see the two hippies from her dream sequence. Following them to an abandoned theater where other hippies hang out, Joan asks them if they know Carol or have ever seen her before. Neither the hippy man or woman claim that they haven't.As the evidence against Carol mounts, the police surreptitiously obtain her fingerprints, which match those found on the murder weapon, and Carol is soon arrested and charged with murdering Julia. However, doubts begin to circulate with Corvin as he wonders if she is the killer, why was she describing the murder to her psychananalyst in detail before it actually took place? Could it be that someone has read her dream diary that she kept and modeled the killing on dream images she described in order to frame her for something she fantasized about? Corvin also wonders if Carol is the killer, who are the two hippies she claims to have witnessed her crime without intervening?As Carol is awaiting trial in the grounds of a maximum security sanitorium, she sees one of the hippies break in and chase her through the grounds. Carol flees into the building and in trying to hide she enters a room containing a hideous experiment: four live dogs, claimed in an upright position, whimper helplessly, their abdomens sliced open and pinned with surgical clamps exposing their glistening innards and still beating hearts. Carol faints in horror. When she comes around, there is no trace of the threatening man. The sanitorium director thinks that Carols ramblings about the intruder, and the disemboweled dogs, must have been another one of her elaborate hallucinations.Meanwhile, Carol's father swings into overdrive with her case and manages to elaborate a suspicion that appeals to the police. Edmund Brighton discovers Frank's affair with Deborah and that Julia Durer had been blackmailing him for money as not to expose his extramarital affair. Brighton's argument is enough to get Carol released on bail, but Frank remains free and desperately tries to prove his innocence.While relaxing at Brighton's country estate, Carol is contacted by the hippy woman and agrees to meet with them at a secret rendezvous, at the Alexandra Palace in North London. Once there, Carol is attacked by the hippy man in the cellar and chased through the building where she gets attacked by bats in the attic and gets brutally stabbed as the hippy catches up to her on the rooftop. But Carol is rescued by the police, forcing the hippy man to flee.Another red herring emerges when Joan meets with the hippy woman concerning her stepmother's well being and agreeing to meet. The next day, Joan is found murdered in a field with her throat cut. Inspector Corvin meets with Carol recovering at her father's estate to ask about the hippie couple and of the blackmail that Julia Durer may have been planning for Frank.Corvin finally tracks down and arrests the hippie couple, Hubert and Jenny, whom he takes to the scene of the crime to interrogate them about the Durer murder. Although Hubert admits to have stalked Carol and murdered Joan, they protest their innocence claiming not to remember anything about that night except for recalling ""a lizard in a womans skin."" Then a phone call comes informing the police that Brighton has been found dead at his estate, the victim of a suicide, and leaving behind a note confessing to the murder of Julia Durer which seems to wrap up the case.A few days later, Carol is at her father's grave when Corvin arrives to offer his condolences to her. When Corvin asks Carol about the phone call that her father got from Julia Durer which Carol admits that she knew about, he asks how did she know that Julia Durer phoned Mr. Brighton on the day before she was murdered since he never told anybody about it. Too late to realize her slip, Corvin deduces Carol's guilt as she was with Julia Durer during that day the phone call was made.As it turns out, Carol Hammond really did kill Julia Durer after she threatened to go public with their lesbian relationship they've been having for several months. Carol did break into Julia's apartment and stabbed her to death, only to realize that two hippies saw her, which made her panic and leave the scene of the crime. Carol had felt certain that the two hippies would describe her to the police. The murderous, but perfectly sane, Carol entered the event in her dream diary immediately afterwards so by combining details of the murder with images from the recurring nightmares for which she had sought treatment, she hopped to avoid a murder sentence and get off with guilt by temporary insanity that the dream diary would provide plausible evidence in court of a split personality. But Carol did not realize that both hippies where high on LSD and unable to register the significance of what they saw that night. Carol is then led away by Inspector Corvin from her father's grave to a waiting police car."

While walking with Lori on the street, he overhears a strange conversation of two men in a car parked in front of the institute and he asks Lori to watch their faces. The same night, there is a break in at the institute with an attempt of heist. The next morning, researcher Dr. Calabresi dies in the train station and the police believe that it was an accident. However, Lori recognizes the picture of the scientist in the newspaper as one of the men in the car. Franco contacts the snoopy reporter Carlo Giordano and asks him to blow up the picture and examine the details. The photographer discovers that Dr. Calabresi was pushed off from the platform but he is also killed and the photograph vanishes. After their preliminary investigation, they find that the scientists are researching a revolutionary drug and a genetic experiment of XYY chromosomes associated to delinquency for the government and they conclude that there are nine leads to be followed: each of the five assistants of the institute (Dr. Calabresi; Dr. Esson; Dr. Mobelli; Dr. Casoni; and the gay Dr. Braun); the stepdaughter of Prof. Fulvio Terzi, Anna Terzi; the fiancée of Dr. Calabresi, Bianca Merusi; the missing photograph; and the robbery of the institute.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Franco Arnò, a former journalist, was blinded 15 years ago in an accident. He lives with and cares for his orphaned adolescent niece Lori, who acts as his eyes. Carlo Giordani is an investigative newspaper reporter. Arnò and Giordani meet when Giordani investigates a break-in at the Terzi Institute, which is located across the street from Arnò's home, and which does among other things research into genetics. One of their research projects investigates the chromosome makeup of people with criminally violent tendencies. In the act of the break-in, the night-watchman was knocked unconscious, and nothing was seemingly stolen, although the authorities and the administrators at the Institute believe it was a case of industrial espionage. Arnò and Giordani join forces when the case turns as one of the Institute's scientists dies in what Arnò is the first to determine was murder, the scientist who Lori saw was staked outside the Institute the night of the break-in. There are other subsequent deaths associated with the case and/or the Terzi Institute. As the two get closer to the truth, their and Lori's lives are in danger as the murderer knows they are on his/her tail.

Franco overhears him mention blackmail. Franco bends over, feigning tying his shoes and asks Lori to describe the man in the parked car. Lori does, but says that she cannot see the other man clearly. They walk back to Franco's apartment nearby and while Lori sleeps, Franco works on a puzzle when he hears a noise. Outside, the unseen man in the parked car gets out and knocks out a night watchman by the gate of a large medical complex that stands right next to the apartment building where Franco lives. The unseen man uses a screwdriver to get inside the building, goes to Dr. Calabresi's office, unlocks it and gets inside. A doctor preparing to leave for the night sees the nightwatchman unconsicious and sees a dark figure running away.The next day, the police arrive at the Terzi Institute investigating the break-in. Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus) arrives and bumps into Franco outside the institute and helps the blind man up. Carlo introduces himself and says that he's a reporter investigating the break-in. Inside, Carlo learns that nothing was stolen from the institute. Professor Terzi (Tino Carraro) tells the officers that since nothing is missing, he would rather not reveal the institutes research. Dr. Casoni (Aldo Reggiani) suggests that pictures may have been taken, but Dr. Braun (Horst Frank) says to let the cops handle the matter. Meanwhile, Dr. Calabresi (Carlo Alighiero), (the same man from the car who Franco overheard) looks at his files in his office and phones someone and agrees to meet with him. Calabresi tells his fiancee Bianca Merusi (Rada Rassimov) that he knows who broke into the institute and what was taken, but he does not wish to tell anyone yet, saying it could mean a ""big step forward"". At a local train station, while a group of reporters are waiting for an celebrity starlet to arrive from an arriving train, the unseen man approaches Calabresi and pushes him as the train arrives.The next day, Frano and Lori are at home when Lori reads the newspaper for Frano about the ""accidental death"" of Dr. Calabresi and she tells Franco that the man in the newspaper is the same man she saw in the car the night before. She describes the picture and says that Carlo Giordani wrote the article. The two of them go to see the reporter at the newspaper office and Franco asks if the picture has been cropped. Carlo calls Righetto (Vittorio Congia) the paparazzi photographer who snapped the picture at the last second and he goes back to the orginal and sees a moving hand-arm in the far left of the frame. As Righetto prepares to print the photograph, he is strangled to death with a cord. The unseen killer takes the photo and all the negatives and leaves just seconds before Carlo, Franco, and Lori arrive. Carlo goes inside the apartment and finds the body. Carlo sends Franco and Lori away and calls the police. The investigating officer, Spimi (Pier Paolo Capponi), asks questions to Carlo about the ""maniac"". Later, Carlo looks through a pair of binoculars at the people leaving the Terzi Institute and describes the doctors to Franco as they leave whom are Mombell, Esson, Casoni, and Braun, as well as Terzi and his daughter Anna (Catherine Spaak).Carlo goes to the Terzi home and he expresses his desire to talk about Calabresi's ""accident"". Afterwards, Carlo speaks with Anna, and he evades her questions of what he and her father spoke about. The two of them drive away together and Anna drives in full speed to evade a car with two detectives following them. Meanwhile, Franco and Lori go to talk with Bianca, and she says apologetically that she could not find anything in the house relating to her fiancées death. After they leave, Franco asks Lori what he kept hearing while they were talking, and Lori says it was a chain and locket around her neck and that Bianca was fidgeting with it.Elsewhere, Carlo and Anna talk over drinks at a local restaurant where she tells them about the institute's research of ""chromosome alteration"" and ""XYY"", the extra Y producing a ""criminal tendency"" in a person. Carlo then goes to see Dr. Braun at the St Peter's Club and he talks to the doctor about someone being after the institute's secret drug. Braun does not seem vexed.Bianca takes a taxi to Calabresi's parked car in a lot. Inside, she finds a tiny note with an appointment time at the station (and an unseen name) written down. She tapes the note to the inside of her locket. Bianca then calls Franco and says she knows who killed Calabresi, but she will only tell him in person. As Bianca walks down the hallway of her apartment building to return to her apartment, the unseen killer attacks and strangles her with a cord. The killer rummages through her purse, but does not find anything.Franco shows Carlo a note he received in which the killer threatens the ""puzzle solver"" and the ""journalist"" or more people will die. Carlo talks to Franco that he found out that two of the doctors, Casoni, being fired from his last job, and Braun having received a lot of money. Carlo goes to see Casoni and the doctor talks about the institute's ""wonder drug"" and the ""XYY pattern"". Carlo then asks Dr. Mombell about XYY, and the doctor says that everyone in the institute was tested, but their results are confidential.The unseen killer approaches Carlo's front door and injects two milk cartons, dropped off by the local milkman, with a syringe. A little later, Carlo arrives home and brings the milk cartons inside. Anna arrives shortly thereafter and they talk about more about the research and of her results of the XYY test. Their talk leads to a kiss and they end up having sex. Afterwards, Carlo pours himself and Anna a glass of milk from one of the cartons when Franco phones saying that someone tampered with the gas line on his stove, flooding his apartment with methane gas and also may try to kill Carlo. Carlo notices the milk that had bled from the cartons from the hypodermic needle holes and knocks the glass away from Anna before she can drink it. Carlo smells and tastes the milk and deduces that it has been poisoned.The following day, Carlo meets with one of his old friends and informants, named Gigi the Loser (Ugo Fangareggi) (so-named since he spent time in prison), for help in investigating the Terzi break-in which may have been an inside job. Carlo and Gigi break into Terzi's house and discover that Anna is adopted and (via a diary) that Terzi apparently ""adored"" the woman. Carlo then goes to the police station and learns from Spimi that Bianca often met with Braun and that the cops cannot find the doctor. Carlo then runs a story in the newspaper about Braun being a suspect in the break-in, and a former gay lover of Manuel approaches Carlo and tells him where Braun is hiding. Carlo goes over to the apartment where he is attacked by Manuel (Braun's new lover). Carlo wins the fight, and sees Braun lying dead on the couch. But the police conclude that Manuel had nothing to do with the break-in and that he murdered Braun out of a jealous rage.A few days later, Franco contacts Carlo where he recalls Bianca's locket and suggests that the note that she found of the killer's name might still be there. Franco and Carlo head to the cemetery and open Bianca's family crypt. Carlo gets her coffin open while Franco waits by the door. Carlo finds the locket that was buried with Bianca, opens it, and discovers the note behind a metal plate and hands it to Franco. As Carlo closes the coffin, Franco shuts the crypt door, locking Carlo in. After spending a few minutes in the dark crypt, Franco opens the door again and walks inside without his dark sunglasses with a bruise on his face, and a large blade protruding from his walking cane that's speared with blood. Franco tells the reporter that he was attacked outside by the killer who told him that he has Lori as a captive, and was forced to give him the note. But Franco tells him that he managed to stab the killer with his cane. Meanwhile, Lori is hit on the head and put in the back of a car. Franco and Carlo find the taxi (which the killer and Lori rode in) and discover blood in the back seat. The unseen killer then calls Franco and tells him that he will hold Lori for a while and to stop investigating the break in, and the murders.Carlo goes to the police to report the kidnapping and they go to the Terzi house, and Anna comes down the stairs with cloth wrapped around her hand. Carlo tells her about the father-daughter ""relationship"" that he knows about and expresses suspicion about the milk incident (Anna had the glass of poisoned milk for some time without drinking it). But Anna claims that she only cut her hand on a broken vase and was nowhere near the cemetery which was just a few hours ago. She is irate that Carlo suspects her of being the killer. But with little evidence to arrest her, Carlo and the others leave.Carlo and the police arrive at the Terzi Institute and search the place for Lori whom Carlo suspects that the killer is one of the doctors, but they find nothing. As Carlo walks on a stairwell, he finds blood on his collar, and he thinks back to the room he just came from. He returns to the room and sees blood dripping from the ceiling. He climbs up to the roof and chases an unseen person. Then the unseen person turns around and it is Casoni who hits him in the face and kicks Carlo to the ground. Casoni, with a stab wound to his stomach, goes to a back room where a gagged Lori is and prepares to stab her. Carlo runs in and tackles the killer, but gets stabbed in the chest. Just then the police arrive on the roof and chase Casoni, but he gets caught by Franco who stops him with his cane blade. Franco asks about Lori, and Casoni (deranged to the last) tells Franco that he killed her. Enraged, Franco swings his cane at Casoni who tries to run and pushes the deranged doctor through a sky window and he falls down an elevator shaft to his death, just as Lori calls out for Franco."

Andy returns to the Banner house and hides out in their barn; after making peace with Sylvia, they are discovered in the barn by Andy, who admits what he's done.

The doctor revives it and uses it to take revenge on his professional rival, Dr. Beaumont.—Jeremy Lunt <durlinlunt@acadia.net> During the day, Dr. Durea [J. Carroll Naish] runs the Creature Emporium [a sideshow

wheelchair but, by night, Durea is a mad scientist (and the last living member of the Frankenstein
family) working on some sort of blood serum. For this serum, he needs the blood of women who
were scared to death, as it is their fear that ""energizes the molecular structure of
their blood"". To do this, he has his mute, mentally disabled assistant Groton [Lon Chaney Jr.]
behead young girls with an ax and then bring him their bodies. Durea then
resurrects them so that he can harvest their blood.One night, Dr. Durea is visited by Count Dracula [Zandor Vorkov] who has found
the Frankenstein Monster [John Bloom], which had been buried in a secret
tomb in Oakmoor Cemetary. In exchange for Durea's serum (which Dracula hopes will
make him invincible by enabling him to be active during the daytime without the sunlight
destroying him), Dracula offers Durea the use of the Monster in order to get revenge on
Durea's professional rival, Dr. Beaumont [Forrest J Ackerman], who was responsible
for setting the laboratory fire that crippled Durea when Beaumont and two of his colleagues
found out about Durea's experiments and his plans for the Monster, after which they buried
the Monster in the secret tomb and then forgot about the tomb and where it was. Together,
they revive the Monster and he eventually does kill Beaumont.Meanwhile, Las Vegas showgirl Judith Fontaine [Regina Carrol] is searching for her missing

sister. No one has seen her. When someone slips some LSD into her coffee,
Judith goes through an acid trip and falls unconscious, then wakes up on the couch of aging hippie
Mike Howard [Anthony Eisley], who offers his help (along with a few kisses). When they learn that
Joanie was last seen at the Creature Emporium, they both pay a visit to Dr. Durea,

but the Monster has a sudden change of heart and protects her by turning on Dracula, but not before
removing his ring from his finger.Dracula and the Monster start fighting each other. Their fight carries
them outside into the surrounding woods. Dracula kills the Monster first
by dismembering him, tearing off first his arms and then his head. But the Monster has
prolonged the fight as he had planned to the point where the sun is starting to rise,
and Dracula must return to his coffin or be destroyed. He makes a dash for the church,
but the morning sun fully rises, causing him to collapse by the church's front door and slowly
disintegrate into dust. Judith frees herself from her bonds and escapes, stopping only to
observe Dracula's remains at the church's door and pick up his ring, after which she recalls
everything that has happened to her, drops the ring on the ground and flees in terror.

pentagram on his chest), so two disbelieving coroners remove the silver
bullets to prove to themselves that there are no such things as
werewolves. Of course, the werewolf is immediately revived and kills
the two coroners on his way out the door.Back in Paris, college students Elvira [Gaby Fuchs] and Genevieve [Barbara Capell] are completing
their ""final thesis."" They've tracked down the tomb of the a 15th century
Countess Wandessa d'Arville de Nadasdy, a supposed witch and vampire. The
Countess's tomb is said to lie near a small village somewhere in northern
France, so the girls load up their car and go in search of the place.
Short on gas, daylight, and directions, however, they accept an invitation
to stay at the rustic (meaning 'no lights, no phone, no motorcar')
countryhouse of writer Waldemar Daninsky. Over a dinner of cold cuts and
wine, Waldemar reveals that he's writing a book about the history of
gothic churches and monuments, but he falls silent when Elvira mentions
her search for Wandessa.The girls retire for the night, but Elvira is awakened from her sleep
when Waldemar's sister Elizabeth [Yelena Samarina] steals into the room, feels her up,
attempts to strangle her, and warns her to leave before the night of the

lost her mental stability after the death of their father but that she is
harmless. Meanwhile, Genevieve explores the manor and comes across a shack
with blood on the walls and shackles hanging from the ceiling. Then
Genevieve is attacked by Elizabeth, but Waldemar explains that the
shackles are used to hang game, so the girls decide to remain. In private,
Waldemar warns Elizabeth to leave the girls alone because they are his
""last hope.""Armed with papers, documents, and maps, Elvira, Genevieve, and
Waldemar go in search of Wandessa's tomb. They find and open it
uneventfully but Genevieve cuts her arm when she pulls the silver Mayenza
cross from the chest of Wandessa's cadaver, and some of Genevieve's blood
drips on Wandessa's lips. Later that evening, of course, Wandessa [Patty Shepard] rises
from her coffin and calls Genevieve to join her in the garden where she
wets her whistle on Genevieve's blood and returns later for a nightcap on
Elizabeth. Genevieve, now a vampire, pops in for a bite on Elvira, but
Waldemar chases her away with the Mayenza cross. With Genevieve and
Elizabeth out of the way, Elvira confesses her love for Waldemar
(forgetting Marcel, her policeman boyfriend back in Paris), and the two
vow to fight Wandessa together, although Waldemar must first take ""certain
precautions"" to ensure Elvira's safety because tonight is a full moon.

village, safely locked in a lodge there.Elvira goes to the village. The full moon rises. Waldemar turns into
a werewolf and kills a camper. The next morning, Elvira finds Waldemar

by someone who loves him will release him from the curse. But first things
first. First, they have to destroy Wandessa. While Waldemar is out hunting
for her hiding place, Genevieve sates her thirst on Elvira. Waldemar
doesn't find Wandessa, but he does run into Genevieve and destroys her,
which releases Elvira and heals the bite marks on her neck. Because it's
another full moon tonight, Elvira places Waldemar in shackles, but he
escapes just in time to save Elvira from being assaulted by Pierre [José Marco], the
handyman.The next morning, while Elvira is in bed with Waldemar, her Parisien
lover Marcel [Andres Resino] drives into town. He starts asking around about Elvira's
whereabouts and hears strange stories about Waldemar Daninsky, black
magic, vampires, and young girls dying. Marcel finally gets a lead from
Pierre's old girlfriend and decides to pay Waldemar a visit. When Marcel
shows up at Waldemar's house, Elvira greets him with a less than exuberant
kiss, and Marcel realizes that something is going on between Elvira and
Waldemar. Marcel threatens to launch a fullscale investigation into the
rumors surrounding Waldemar, so Waldemar talks Elvira into leaving with
Marcel.Tonight is Walpurgisnacht, the night when Satan rules the earth and
Wandessa will have all her powers. Thinking Elvira safe, Waldemar steps up
his search for Wandessa. However, Wandessa is holding Marcel and Elvira in
her lair while she prepares to make Elvira a blood sacrifice to her Lord
and Master, Satan. Just as Wandessa is about to plunge the knife into
Elvira, however, Waldemar wanders in and rescues Elvira. But the full moon
is on the rise, and Waldemar transforms into a werewolf. As Elvira and
Marcel watch, vampire and werewolf battle it out. The werewolf ultimately
reduces the vampire to a bony shroud crawling with waxworms. Elvira
suddenly grabs the Mayenza cross and, with all the love in her heart,
plunges it into the werewolf's heart. The werewolf turns back
into Waldemar, and Elvira and Marcel leave the tomb with their arms around
each other. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

But the truth is revealed at the end. While walking in the park with her dog, Tina Brandt is flirted with by the Gianni Prada, a playboy in a fancy sport car.

Her mother Sofia sees Tina sneaking in, her dress torn apart, and Tina tells her mother that Gianni tried to rape her. The next morning, Gianni tells a different story to his friend. Later, the doorman tells another version of the story. Last but not the least, the possible truth is disclosed.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil John (Brett Halsey) is a young playboy who is driving his silver sports car though Rome when he catches sight of Tina (Daniela Giordano) on the street, so he begins to follow her. She acts disinterested, but he refuses to give up. After finally catching up to her in a nearby park, John asks her out on the date, and she finally agrees.Later that afternoon, John arrives at Tina's apartment to pick her up. He is greeted by her severe, old-fashioned mother (Valeria Sabel) and is warned not to keep Tina out too late. Though John seems disappointed in her assertion that ""Tina's a good girl"", he takes her out to a swinging nightclub where they have a great time dancing.At 2:00 a.m., Tina arrives back at her apartment and her mother, who waited up for her, is furious for staying out so late. Her anger escalates when she sees that Tina's dress, 'a Paris original', has been badly torn. Tina tells her mother that John attempted to rape her and then recalls the night's events: after leaving the nightclub, John took her back to his large, spacious apartment, where he kept her prisoner and tried to force himself on her. Tina is adamant that she rejected his advances, even going as far as to scratch his forehead in retaliation. She then explains that she managed to escape after locking the sex-mad swinger in his large, ultra-mod bathroom, and then made her escape. Having finished telling the story, Tina's mother wants to phone the police, but Tina stops her by saying: ""they'll never believe me.""Meanwhile at the nightclub, John arrives at the nearly deserted place for a nightcap where he is noticed by a few friends of his who note some deep scratches on his forehead. Having seen him with Tina earlier, the friends ask him jokes if he ""did it"" with the girl. John is offended by the suggestion and offers his version of the events. In John's version of the story, it was Tina who came onto HIM in the park, and it was her idea that they go out. John says that he could sense danger from the start after arriving at Tina's apartment and meeting her mother, both of whom vied for his affection. After this farcical incident, he and Tina went to the nightclub as planed. John took her back to his apartment where they engaged in a veritable string of sexual encounters. He finishes the story by explaining that the scratches on his forehead were the result of over-zealous lovemaking on Tina's part, and that she used up so much of his energy that he had to stop for a drink after taking her home.The following morning, the sleazy doorman (Dick Randall) at John's apartment building has his own version of the events of the previous night to share with his friend the milkman (Rainer Basedow). The doorman explains that John is really a homosexual who lures pretty girls to his apartment for the benefit of his lesbian friend Esmeralda (Pascale Petit). Thus, when John retuned from the nightclub with Tina, he phoned Esmeralda, and his gay lover, George (Michael Hinz), and asked them to come over. Once they arrived, John went off with George leaving Tina with Esmeralda, who drugged the girl's drink and tried to take advantage of her. When the doorman, spying on them from the building rooftop, left to tend to the front door of the building, he returned when Tina was waking up. She tried to escape, John attempted to restrain her and ended up having his forehead scratched. The milkman is skeptical to the doorman's claims, but the doorman responds that he saw the whole thing with his own eyes.At this point, a German-speaking psychologist (Calisto Calisti) interrupts the movie to offer the viewers the ""true sequence of events"" which he gathered from police reports and various other sources. The real explanation he claims is much more innocent: John and Tina were both struck by love at first sight when they first met in the park on that day. After a pleasant first date at the nightclub, they did return to John's apartment for a make-out session. By mutual consent, they decided to wait a while before consummating their romance. But John's efforts to take her home are thwarted when the front gate to his apartment building refuses to open. With the doorman nowhere to be found (he is actually on the building rooftop spying on another couple in the same manner he described), John tried to give Tina a boost over the gate, and she tore her dress by accident on the pike top of the iron gate, and accidentally scratched his forehead when she fell onto him. Knowing full well that nobody will believe such a crazy explanation, they both decided to make up their own stories to tell to whoever might be interested.Which of these four stories is the true one? You decide."

Apart from the sexual liaisons, he's at constant odds with the network. When Greg begins to recover and wants to take back his reign, he gets considerable resistance from Robin. So Greg considers harsher methods to oust Robin from his former position and regain control of the network.—alfiehitchie The rise of Robin Stone at New York based network International Broadcasting Company (IBC) is presented. As the anchor of the local affiliate's news broadcast, he first comes to the attention of IBC owner Greg Austin via his wife, Judith Austin, a fan charmed by Robin's unmistakable charisma i.e. good looks and knowing how to use it, Greg who brings him in to the corporate news division. That charisma from the outside is an inward narcissism and need for control in always believing he knows best, especially for himself, which often places him at odds with IBC President Danton Miller. A further source of contention between the two stems from their differing views of the network: while Robin believes it should be about class, namely putting himself front and center, Dan sees it more as catering to the classless masses. Arguably Robin's only true friend, as long as it suits both their needs, is high end fashion photographer Jerry Nelson, who is able to supply many of Robin's sexual conquests in the form of models while not being a threat himself in his homosexual orientation. What may be the biggest threat to Robin's professional rise is the fact of women clamoring to be with him while he quickly tires of them in his need for that control in being the predator, which often manifests itself in violence if things don't go his way. The obsession of two of those women - Amanda, Jerry's most famous up-and-coming model, and Judith herself - may be the most problematic as neither will allow herself to be ignored by Robin.—Huggo"

They herd them into the cattle wagon, taking money and other objects from them as they pass. Dr. Miller takes out all his money and gives it to them while holding onto the suitcase. One of the assailants tries to take the suitcase from him, but Dr. Miller strikes them with it and draws his gun. Two of the assailants gang on him and the first one wrenches the suitcase from him as the other strikes him from behind, knocking him out, and he is left dangling from the train. The suitcase is emptied and then left behind. The first assailant places the flower they were carrying in their lapel on a wanted poster of Frenchie King and leaves the train with their companions.The five robbers run until they reach the spot where a middle-aged black man is holding their horses. They throw the loot from the train into a wagon, which the man drives, and mount their horses. They gallop away from the crime scene as the initial credits roll. At the end of the scene, the robbers take off their masks and hats, revealing that they are all women.Dr. Miller lies bloodied on the tracks. An Asian man finds him and takes money from the doctors pockets, then carries him away.In Bougival Junction, a French immigrant town, Christmas is being celebrated. The villagers going about their daily life are rudely interrupted by five horsemen, a woman named Maria Sarrazin (Claudia Cardinale) and her four brothers, riding into the village and firing off their guns in glee as they wish everyone a merry Christmas. Many of the villagers cry out the Sarrazins! in terror and duck for cover.In the town marshals office, Marshal Morgan Jefford (Michael J. Pollard) wakes up from a nap and fumbles with his holster as he bemoans his stationing in an immigrant town. He orders Maria and her brothers to drop their guns, but Maria smiles at him and wishes him a merry Christmas and Morgan, smitten by her, ignores their conduct. He asks her where shes going, and Maria says shes going to the train station to pick up presents. Morgan decides to follow, but has trouble getting his horse to listen to him and the villagers laugh at him.At the train station, Maria effortlessly commands her brothers as she joins the crowd waiting for the train. Everyone is startled when the train doesnt stop, but Maria is quick to get on her horse and give chase to the train. She cuts over a hill and manages to get on the train, then runs on the wagons until she gets to the engine, and stops the train.Marias brother Mathieu walks through one of the passenger wagons and claims that Dr. Millers suitcase is his. He tears away the owners name with a knife.Morgan listens to the passengers complaints and their hyperbolic description of Frenchie King and swears that hell hang the outlaw, who he assumes is a man. He then goes to flirt with Maria and asks if he can visit sometime, to which she answers that he should learn French first. Morgan wonders if she doesnt need a man to help her out at the ranch and Maria laughs at that as she rides home with her brothers.That night at the Sarrazins house, the family dines and sings Christmas carols while theyre attended to by their Native American servant, Spitting Bull (Valéry Inkijinoff). Its obvious that Maria is the leader of the family as the brothers cower under her commands and scoldings. When the clock strikes midnight, the brothers scurry to open their presents, all from their aunt Amelie. Jean gives her the suitcase that Mathieu found in the train earlier. Maria goes up to her bedroom, leaving her brothers to celebrate. She opens her other gift, a red corset. Then she inspects the suitcase and finds the map of Little P. ranch in a hidden compartment. She is shocked to discover that the ranch has oil.Out in the prairie, Louise (Brigitte Bardot), whos the leader of the robbers, distributes the trains loot over her gang consisting of her half-sisters, while their manservant Marquis (Leroy Haynes) cooks them dinner. When Louise goes to light a cigarette, Marquis tells her that shes smoking more than her father, the original Frenchie King. Louise drily asks if thats what killed him, making Marquis cry. Louise recalls that Christmas day was the day her father was hanged, eight years before. She claims shes been long over it. She and her sisters muse on what a great man their father was. Louise discovers that the paper shes using to light her cigarette is the deed to the Little P. ranch. She decides that the gang is to throw away their guns and take possession of the ranch. To this end, she will take on the identity of Dr. Miller.Somewhere else, the Asian man reanimates Dr. Miller with acupuncture.The next day, the Sarrazin brothers are doing chores around the house while Maria goes out to town. She is accosted by two drunken men but makes quick work of them. She enters a brothel where a woman is singing. The woman interrupts herself when she sees Maria and runs to hug her; shes Marias aunt Amelie (Micheline Presle).Maria tells aunt Amelie about the Little P. ranch and how its filled with oil, hoping that she might borrow money from her. Aunt Amelie disbelieves her story. Maria decides that shell ask the bank for a loan, but aunt Amelie, distrustful of banks, stops her and lends her five dollars. Maria asks what shes supposed to do with so little money, but aunt Amelie simply sends her on her way with her co-worker Forsythe. Forsythe helps Maria play the rigged casino roulette and she wins enough money to buy the Little P. ranch.Meanwhile, Louise and her sisters arrive at Bougival Junction and cause sensation among the inhabitants. Morgan finds himself in a conundrum as Angeline Letellier wants him to kick them out of town, while the men try to convince him to protect them. As Louise makes her way to Little P. ranch, she barely misses Maria and her brothers going to town.Maria tries to buy the Little P. ranch, but Morgan informs her that its already been sold to Dr. Miller. Maria is outraged that the property has been sold to who she thinks is an American and angrily rides there.At Little P. ranch, Louises sisters are disappointed at the derelict state of the place and Louise resolves that theyll spend the night at Fort Sages hotel and then leave. Then, Maria and her brothers storm the property while firing their guns and order the occupants of the house out, to which Louise and her sisters, gunless, comply. Maria questions their identity and intentions and Louise fully takes on the guise of a doctor. Maria claims that Little P. ranch has nothing of value and that shell help Louise out by buying it off her at triple the price. She leaves, saying she expects an answer by the next day. Louises sisters are charmed by Marias offer, but Louises pride has been wounded by Marias haughty attitude, so she decides that theyll stay after all. Louise suspects that Maria is hiding something and orders her sisters to investigate the brothers while she takes on Maria herself.The next day, Louise shops around the town and asks the villagers about Maria. After hearing that she breeds horses, she goes to visit her at her ranch, ostensibly with the intention of buying a horse. Maria mocks Louise, thinking shes a city girl not used to life in the Wild West, and tries to sell her a bad-tempered horse. Louise shows her expertise in riding untamed horses, impressing Marias brothers and leaving Maria offput.Meanwhile, Morgan receives a telegram informing him that Frenchie King is in the area, disguised as a woman.That night at Letelliers bar, Morgan studies French to impress Maria while Louises sisters flirt and play poker with Marias brothers. Morgan notes Louises absence and suspects that she might be Frenchie King. He goes to the Little P. ranch and sees Louise digging a well. Marquis comes to urge Louise to go find her sisters as they are late in arriving home. Morgan then tries to spy on her taking a bath to confirm her gender, but is unsuccessful.Back at the bar, the sisters cheat at poker by speaking in code but are found out by the brothers. The sisters start a bar brawl in response and overpower the brothers. Maria then runs in firing off her pistol to stop the ruckus. She chastises her brothers and forces the sisters to return the money they unfairly won, but then Louise walks in. She mocks Maria, saying its easy to give orders with a gun in the hand. Maria gives her a gun and challenges her, then shoots the ground around her to make her dance. Louise decides she has had enough and demonstrates her skill with guns by cleanly shooting the brothers hats off their heads and Marias gun off her hand, leaving her stunned. Louise then gives Maria her gun back, having proven her point. Maria tells Louise to leave the town immediately and it seems like the two are about to have a shoot-out in the bar, but Morgan walks in and clumsily stops them.The next day, out in the prairie, Dr. Miller practices his shooting and complains to the Asian man that he wont heal his legs. The Asian man says that he wont do anything if hes not paid.At the Sarrazins ranch, the brothers discuss the merits of marrying Louises sisters, namely that theyd be marrying into the oil fortune. Maria comes in and says shes expecting a suitor to visit her, and sends the brothers up to their rooms, but they sneak out of the house through the window. The suitor turns out to be Morgan; Maria is looking to convince him to kick Louise and her sisters out of Little P. ranch by seducing him. Morgan tells her its impossible, that the ranch is now sold. Maria gets angry, tells him to find a way and forces him out of the house. Morgan departs, saying hell never understand women.Maria sees that her brothers arent home and goes looking for them. They are down by the river, spying on Louise and her sisters taking a bath after tearing down Marias fence. Maria arrives, chastises them and sends them home, then takes Louises dress and throws it in the river to spite her. After she leaves, Louise remarks that Maria is starting to irritate her.The next day, theres a festival going on in Bougival Junction. Louise tells her sisters to get to their positions in preparation to execute a plan. Louise distracts Maria and makes her sing a song in front of the entire town. Maria is hoisted by a crowd and hits her head in a doorframe. She faints. Using her authority as a doctor, Louise sends her home with instructions for Spitting Bull to keep her asleep.Meanwhile, the Pekingese dog limps on the train tracks.The sisters then go around town to find the brothers. Upon finding them, the sisters knock them out and carry them off to the Little P. ranch. During this, Louise flirts with Morgan and gets him drunk to distract him. Morgan confesses that he suspected Louise was Frenchie King, which Louise laughs off. Once Louise sees that her sisters have completed their part of the plan, she discards Morgan and leaves for Little P. ranch. Morgan finds the Pekingese dog and takes it in.On the way to Little P. ranch, Louise orders Caroline to make the brothers squeal about the ranchs secret.At the Sarrazins ranch, Maria wakes up in a fit. Spitting Bull prepares a concoction, apparently prescribed by Louise, which puts her into a restful sleep.At the Little P. ranch, Louise waits for her sisters to present results. She becomes impatient, picks up a rifle and goes up to their rooms. She discovers that her sisters prefer romancing the brothers to doing their part and angrily herds the brothers downstairs. She tortures the brothers by stripping them naked and training her rifle on them, demanding to know what Maria is looking for. When she starts shooting at their feet, they admit that the ranch has oil, but dont know exactly where it is.Maria wakes up, fully rested, and asks Spitting Bull where her brothers are. He answers cryptically and hands her her clothes. Maria looks for her brothers all over Bougival Junction, deserted from everyone passing out drunk during the festival. When Morgan fails to be of any help, she takes one of his rifles and rides out to Little P. ranch.Back at the Little P. ranch, the sisters and the brothers continue to flirt with each other. Marquis warns Louise that Maria is approaching. Louise orders her sisters to herd the brothers into the well she has been digging. The sisters then say theyll back Louise up while she confronts Maria, but Louise refuses, saying this is only between the two of them.Maria arrives at the ranch and demands Louise to show herself. Louise confidently steps out. Maria asks where her brothers are. Louise replies by asking where the oil is. Louise then approaches Maria and shows that shes not carrying any weapons. Maria throws away her guns in response, then steps forward and punches Louise in the face. The two women start fighting.Marquis and Spitting Bull watch from the nearby shed and bet on wholl be the winner. In the well, the brothers wonder whats going on and Luc, who appears to be claustrophobic, starts panicking. Caroline wants to break the two women up but Virginie argues that Louise told them not to meddle.In the town, Dr. Miller goes into Morgans office with several men and lets him know that hes the real owner of the Little P. ranch. Miller forces the drunken marshal to come along with him.Louise and Marias fight continues; they are obviously becoming tired. The brothers unsuccessfully try to climb out of the well, so Luc starts digging the ground with a metal bar. The sisters eventually all agree that the fight has to stop, but halt when they see Morgan, Dr. Miller and his men arrive.Dr. Miller orders Morgan to arrest the people whove taken his property, but Morgan hesitates. When two of Millers men advance, Morgan stops them, saying hes the law. Morgan watches Louise and Maria fight for a bit more before intervening, but he gets caught up between blows and knocked out.Luc keeps digging at the well in a frenzy, and then stabs the ground with the bar in frustration. From that place, oil starts gushing out. Louise and Maria stop fighting upon seeing the geyser and faint from fatigue. Marquis and Spitting Bull take advantage of the chaos to take their mistresses away without Dr. Miller and his men noticing. However, the sisters and the brothers are caught. Morgan wakes up to take the prisoners away while Dr. Miller rejoices. After everyone but the doctor has left, the well suddenly explodes, presumably killing Dr. Miller.Marquis and Spitting Bull carry Louise and Maria away in a wagon. The two women wake up and each ascertains that the other is okay before complimenting her skills. They remark that they mightve been friends if theyd met before.Sometime later, the group is resting by the river. Louise is relaxed and eating but Maria paces nervously because their siblings are under arrest. Maria berates Louise, who she now knows is Frenchie King, for being so careless and tells her that Morgan has sworn to hang her, but Louise is unimpressed. Maria starts to guess that she actually has a plan, but Louise frustrates her again. Maria decides she has had enough and that shell go to rescue her brothers herself. Louise relents and goes with her, but not before giving her a white outfit that mirrors her own black one as Frenchie King.Back in town, Morgan marries Louises sisters and Marias brothers to each other before getting them to prison by train. Louise and Maria get on board the moving train. Virginie signals their arrival to Marc, distracts Morgan by throwing her knitting yarn on the floor and he bends to pick it up. Maria points her gun at him and the siblings draw their own weapons to force the sheriff and the passengers into the cattle wagon. The new family of bandits then makes their escape, with each newlywed couple jumping off one by one, trailed by Louise and Maria who jokingly give each other precedence before jumping off. Louise and Maria land behind a bush and laugh together.Morgan sits in his office, put off by his failure as sheriff. He contemplates a wanted poster of Frenchie King, which now includes a new bandit known as The Man in White (Maria, of course) and a raised bounty, and remarks to the Pekingese dog that there is no place in the West for the real men as he throws away his holster and badge.Far away in the prairie, Louise and Maria lead their siblings, and Marquis and Spitting Bull in their wagon. They put on their masks, Louise and Maria gesture forward and they start galloping into the distance.THE END"

Pirkle, this film warns what will happen to America if the citizens do not give up their depraved ways and turn to God and Jesus for salvation.

Chris Bradley is a young man who returns to his home city of Pittsburgh after several years of drifting and working odd jobs around the country since his discharge from the U.S. Army. Not wanting to move back in with his father and return to the family busies of manufacturing baby food, Chris meets and shacks up with Lynn, an older woman who works as a model in local TV commercials and becomes his 'sugar mama,' supporting him financially and emotionally. This begins to put a strain on the affair, especially when Lynn finds out that she's pregnant and does not feel that Chris would make a responsible father or husband.—matt-282 In New York City, after completing an Army tour in Vietnam, Chris Bradley (Raymond Laine) loses interest in his job as recording session backup guitarist and drives to his home town of Pittsburgh, where he looks up his father at the restaurant in which he frequently dines.Roger Bradley (Roger McGovern), the owner of a baby food manufacturing company, is pleased to see his son, but gently warns that he should get some direction in his life. Together, they visit a go-go club, where Chris is amused to see that his father is attracted to the dancer. When Roger says he can ""still cut the mustard,"" Chris introduces him to Samantha (Louise Sahene), a dancer who is a friend of his ex-girl friend, Terri Terrific (Johanna Lawrence). Later, now drunk, the three of them visit Terri, who has accepted Chris's unpredictable appearances in her life. After inviting themselves in, they smoke marijuana and Sam seduces Roger. Although Chris and Terri share conversation and some laughs, they do not resume their sexual relationship.Meanwhile, Lynn Harris (Judith Ridley, billed as Judith Streiner), an actress in a beer commercial, attracts Michael (Richard Ricci), the commercial's producer. As they film a party scene in which happy couples drink Bold Gold beer, Lynn expresses her doubts about the ethics of making products seem better than they are. Michael responds that the commercials provide jobs for everyone in the room and that people watching the commercial can vicariously have a brief experience of living passionately. After the filming, Lynn goes to Michael's apartment, but when he tries to make love to her, she stops him. In his desire for her, Michael offers to arrange anything for Lynn, but she admits that she is a little afraid of him.The next morning, Terri introduces her young son, Chrissie, to Chris and Roger, explaining that they are his father and grandfather. While waiting for his train, Roger questions Chris about his son, but Chris admits that he is not certain he is really the father and refuses Roger's offer of a job. As Chris returns to his car after seeing Roger off, Lynn, who is late for a TV commercial audition, knocks him down in her rush to catch the train. Chris offers her a ride and, pretending to be her manager, gets her the job without an audition. He then invites her out and during a long day together, they talk about numerous subjects.At her apartment, Lynn tells Chris that she is comfortable with ""making love"" to him, but not ""going to bed"" with him. As a compromise, Chris agrees to sleep on her couch. Having no other place to stay, Chris continues living with Lynn, although the future of their relationship remains unclear. Every morning, Chris awakens to the sound of a radio talk show hosted by Lynn's father. When Lynn tries coaxing Chris into deciding his future, he evades her with flippant jokes. Lynn tells her divorced mother (Eleanor Schirra) that, tiring of the shallowness of doing commercials, she thinks that she wants to be a wife and mother. Bitterly, her mother replies that she was a perfect wife and hostess, and suggests that Lynn get ahead by making her own money.Two months later, while Chris stalls filling out a college application, Lynn says truthfully that she is pregnant, but seeing his reaction, apologizes and retracts her statement. When Lynn orders Chris to leave the apartment for the day because her mother is visiting, he visits Terri. Although Chris enjoys playing the father to Chrissie, Terri tells him it is too late to get involved with her son, and that although she wishes he were Chris's, she is not certain.By listing Lynn's father as a reference, Chris gets an interview for an advertising job for which he is unqualified. Chris' fraudulent use of her father's name and his naïveté that he can get a job without proper training angers Lynn. However, Chris easily bluffs two gullible businessmen into hiring him and later tells Lynn he talked ""horseshit."" Surprised and pleased that he got the job, she apologizes and he admits that she caused him to stretch himself. He then confides that he has a child. Lynn acts stunned and, soon after, meets with Michael to ask for help in ending her pregnancy. Still stinging from Lynn's rejection, Michael snubs her at first, but then admits he is jealous of the baby's father. Although he agrees to procure an abortion for her, he says that when he offered to arrange anything, he had hoped to create, not destroy.At work, Chris is given the task of creating a television commercial to promote the US Army to young men. While listening to his colleague list ridiculous reasons why a man would want to join the Army, Chris looks out the window to an odd street display of an elaborate, function less machine with gears and pulleys. Abruptly, Chris resigns and walks outside past the machine through a crowd of spectators who are being interviewed about the machine by reporters.Later, while talking to Lynn about his day, Chris expresses amusement that people tried to give meaning to the machine, which ""some silly ass"" had displayed for no purpose. More concerned that Chris quit his job, Lynn asks what it is he wants and, after several flippant answers, Chris says he wishes he could talk to her.Later that evening, as Chris, who is unaware of Lynn's pregnancy, waits for her at the apartment, Lynn walks down a dark stairway to a garage where a man (George Kosana) awaits. After she presents him with cash, the man drives her to a vacant building to have an abortion. When Lynn still has not returned by 10:30 pm, Chris leaves a note on her typewriter, asking where she is, and departs.Meanwhile, Lynn is lying on a bed when she changes her mind about the abortion and runs away, chased by two men (in the film's most harrowing scene).Chris proceeds to Terri's apartment, but learns from the landlord that she has moved. Later, Chris' parents discover him sleeping in a tree outside their house. After Chris confides his story about Lynn's and Terri's disappearances, Roger says he should have allowed him to help and expresses impatience that he is providing money for Chris to live a directionless life. Solemnly, Chris says he does not want to work at his father's factory or at any of the other jobs he could have. Understanding, Roger suggests that the situation is a lot like going to Howard Johnson's for an ice cream, where you can get exotic flavors, but somehow end up with vanilla. Chris jokingly asks about the man who prefers butter pecan, to which Roger says that the man is always disappointed when he cannot get it, and adds meaningfully, ""There's always vanilla.""Sometime later, as a commercial plays on a television in a suburban home, a narrator claims that life is available to the man who acts and thinks ""bold."" The commercial continues as Lynn and a man ride off on horses to a gathering of happy friends who drink Bold Gold beer. When the commercial ends, Lynn's husband, who is setting up a bassinet, jokes that the very pregnant Lynn used to be thinner. Soon after, a large, but very light box arrives special delivery. Following the instructions Chris has written on the package, Lynn and her husband go out to their front yard to open it and watch, as two helium-filled balloons float out and up into the bright blue sky."

Punishment Park,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067633/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"""Punishment Park"" is a pseudo-documentary purporting to be a film crews's news coverage of the team of soldiers escorting a group of hippies, draft dodgers, and anti-establishment types across the desert in a type of capture the flag game. The soldiers vow not to interfere with the rebels' progress and merely shepherd them along to their destination. At that point, having obtained their goal, they will be released. The film crew's coverage is meant to insure that the military's intentions are honorable. As the representatives of the 60's counter-culture get nearer to passing this arbitrary test, the soldiers become increasingly hostile, attempting to force the hippies out of their pacifist behavior. A lot of this film appears improvised and in several scenes real tempers seem to flare as some of the ""acting"" got overaggressive. This is a interesting exercise in situational ethics. The cinéma vérité style, hand-held camera, and ambiguous demands of the director - would the actors be able to maintain their roles given the hazing they were taking - pushed some to the brink. The cast's emotions are clearly on the surface. Unfortunately this film has gone completely underground and is next to impossible to find. It would offer a captivating document of the distrust that existed between soldiers willfully serving in the military and those persons who opposed the war peacefully.—Dick Rockwell <dr1orok@atlas.moa.net>"

The Devil's Nightmare,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067592/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of tourists traveling on a bus take a detour to stay overnight in a castle owned by a family cursed with a history of Satanism and death. Undoubtedly, evil comes in many forms. With this in mind, the unholy stain of a silent, irrevocable curse weighs on the eerily vacant castle of the former World War II German general, Baron von Rhoneberg. For decades, a dark pact has been keeping the baron alive; however, now that a group of seven unsuspecting tourists has ended up in the ancient, memory-laden mansion of evil, unseen forces set in motion a bloody ballet of temptation, human weaknesses, and sin. Now, a mysterious, beautiful enchantress takes over, taking great pleasure in toying with the doomed visitors' unspoken desires. But Satan has all the time in the world. Is there an escape from the Devil's longest night?—Nick Riganas In 1945, in Berlin, the wife of Baron von Rhoneberg dies in the delivery and he stabs his newborn daughter to death. In the present days (1971), the tourist guide and driver of a bus Ducha finds a road closed and is forced to take a detour. He seeks a place to spend the night and a man on the road tells that Baron von Rhoneberg is a great host and they may stay in his castle. They are well received by his butler Hans and they go to their rooms. The grump Mason; the seminarian Alvin Sorel; Nancy and her unfaithful husband Howard; and Corinne and her friend Regine meet to have dinner with the Baron and they learn that his family has a curse and the first-born daughter of each generation turns into a succubus. Further, this day is the anniversary of the curse, but the guests believe it is a legend. Out of the blue, the beautiful and sexy Lisa Müller arrives in the castle and joins the group to have dinner. Soon a succubus appears to steal the soul of her victims for the devil.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the 12th century, Sigfried von Rhoneberg signed a pact with the Devil. Along with Rhoneberg's soul, Satan demanded that the eldest daughter of each generation serve him as a succubus. For this reason, the current Baron von Rhoneberg [Jean Servais] killed his firstborn daughter in hopes of stopping the curse. Unknown by the baron, however, his dead brother Rudolph also fathered a daughter with the maid.A tourbus of six [each representing a Deadly Sin]-- seminarian Albin Corvelle [Lorenzo Terson?], rich Mr [?] and Mrs [Colette Emmanuelle] Foster, cynical old Mr Mason [Lucien Raimbourg?], and two pretty girls, Regine [Shirley Corrigan] and Corinne [Ivana Novak] -- plus the ever-hungry tourguide Matt Ducard [Christian Maillet?] are forced to take refuge at the Rhoneberg castle after the road is blocked and a storm threatens.

Gluttony Matt Ducard chokes on a glass of wine, greedy Mrs Foster falls into a quicksand of gold, Mr Foster (envy?) is guillotined, promiscuous Corinne is impaled in an iron maiden, a snake gets slothful Regine, and Lisa pushes cynical Mr Mason from a tower window to be impaled below on a wrought iron fence. Only the seminarian, Albin Sorelle, seems immune to Lisa's seductive charms. When all six tourists are dead, Satan [Daniel Emilfork] calls on Albin. In his prideful belief that he can outwit anyone in a game of chess, Albin makes a deal with Satan--he offers his soul if Satan will return the dead tourists to life. Satan agrees. The next morning, everyone wakes up as though nothing happened. Even Albin remembers it only as a dream.Unfortunately, the baron is wounded that morning in a fencing accident with Hans the butler [Jacques Monseau]. Albin chooses to remain at the castle while the tourists go on. As Albin and Lisa watch the tourbus heading back to the main road, the bus suddenly swerves to miss a funeral wagon (driven by Satan) and goes over a cliff, killing everyone aboard. Albin enfolds the luscious Lisa in his arms, and Satan smiles. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Including hilarious classic skits such as the ""Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook"", ""Defence Against Fresh Fruit"", ""The Dead Parrot"", ""The Lumberjack Song"", ""The Dirty Fork"", and of course, ""The Funniest Joke in the World"", this wacky anthology is, indeed, the beginner's guide to the spectacular, surreal, and mad world of the Monty Python. Now, brace yourselves up for something completely different.—Nick Riganas ""How Not to Be Seen"": A parody of a government film which first displays the importance of not being seen, then devolves into various things being blown up (anyone who is seen is shot down), much to the amusement of the narrator (John Cleese). The narrator eventually composes himself, says ""And now for something completely different,"" and finds himself being blown up.
""Animation - Main Titles:"" Animated by Terry Gilliam.""Man with a Tape Recorder up His Nose"": Immediately following the main title sequence, a screen appears announcing ""The End"". An emcee (Terry Jones) steps onto the stage, explains that the cinema overestimated the film length and announces an interval. In the meantime, two short films are shown - one starring a man (Michael Palin) with a tape recorder up his nose (which plays La Marseillaise) and another starring a man with a tape recorder up his brother's (Graham Chapman) nose (with a brief ""stereo"" segment at the end of the second film, in which both tape recorders are played slightly out of sync).""Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook"": A Hungarian gentleman (Cleese) enters a tobacconist's shop and reads from his phrasebook the declaration: ""I will not buy this record, it is scratched"" (believing it to be a request for cigarettes). Through similar non-sequitur, he and the proprietor (Jones) manage to arrange the purchase of a packet of cigarettes, until the Hungarian's phrasebook-guided English devolves into sexual innuendo (""Do you want to come back to my place, bouncy-bouncy?""). The incident takes a dramatic turn as the tobacconist uses the phrase book to translate the cost into Hungarian - ""costs 6 and 6"" (""Yandelavasa Grldenwi Stravenka"") - and is rewarded with a right cross. The Hungarian gentleman is swiftly arrested for assault, but is released and the author (Palin) of the fraudulent phrasebook is arrested instead. At the author's trial, the prosecutor (Eric Idle) claims that in the book the Hungarian phrase meaning ""Can you direct me to the station?"" is translated by the English phrase, ""Please fondle my buttocks,"" which leads to the film's first exclusive link, in which another Hungarian (Jones) uses the aforementioned inappropriate English phrase to a local gentleman (Chapman), who then gives him proper directions to the station.""Animation - Land of Hands"": An animation depicting cut-out hands as plants and animals.
""Animation - A Shaver's Suicide"": An older man puts shaving cream all over his own head and cuts it clean off.
""Marriage Guidance Counsellor"": Arthur and Deidre Pewtey (Palin and Carol Cleveland) attend an appointment with a marriage guidance counselor (Idle), who ignores Arthur's rather tedious explanation of their situation and openly flirts with Deidre, eventually telling Arthur to leave the room so that he can make love to the man's wife. Initially depressed by this turn of events, Mr. Pewtey is berated by a heavenly voice (Cleese), who tells Arthur to ""pull his finger out"" and thus bolsters his self-confidence... but his attempt to take command of the situation fails miserably (he is told to go away), ultimately leading to a 16-ton weight being dropped on top of him.""Animation - The Carnivorous Pram"": A man pushes a baby carriage that devours several old ladies, until an intended victim is saved by the intervention of an irate viewer (the hand of Gilliam and the voice of Connie Booth) - who reaches into the screen, turns the carriage around, and sets it to attack its owner instead. The old lady is carted away by truck, and replaced by a statue: Michelangelo's David.
""Animation - David's Leaf"": An animated arm tries to remove the fig leaf protecting the aforementioned statue's modesty, and after a brief struggle, succeeds, revealing - not the expected male genitals, but the head of an old woman who demands smut like this not be shown on screen.
""Nudge Nudge"": Sitting in a bar, a man (Idle) asks another man (Jones) about his wife, with a relentless stream of unsubtle sexual innuendos. It turns out that he simply wants to know, ""What's it like?""""Self-Defence Against Fresh Fruit"": In a self-defense course, a Sergeant Major (Cleese) teaches his students (Chapman, Jones, Palin, and Idle) how to defend themselves from an attacker armed with fresh fruit. This sketch begins with a nun (Gilliam, dubbed by Booth) saying ""Well, I think it's overrated"" in response to the previous sketch - another link that is exclusive to this film.
""The Colonel's Warning"": An uptight Colonel (Chapman) warns the film not to get silly again after the above sketch, and orders the director to cut to a new scene.
""Hell's Grannies"": A documentary report about disaffected urban behavior, which includes ""Hell's Grannies"" (antisocial old ladies), ""Baby Snatchers"" (men dressed as babies, who seize random people off the street) and vicious gangs of ""Keep Left"" signs, at which point the Colonel stops the sketch for becoming ""too silly"".
""Camp Square-Bashing"": An army platoon performs precision drilling (also called ""square-bashing"") in a highly effeminate manner, which the Colonel again finds silly (""and a bit suspect, I think"") and replaces with a cartoon.""Animation - The Prince and the Black Spot"": An animation depicts a prince getting a spot on his face, foolishly ignoring it and dying of cancer. The spot then goes out to seek its fortune and marries another spot.
""Kilimanjaro Expedition"": Arthur Wilson (Idle) goes to Sir George Head (Cleese) to join an expedition to Mt. Kilimanjaro, but the interview rapidly descends into chaos due to Head's unusual case of double vision and another member of the expedition (Chapman) trashing the office. The scene ends when Head is startled to see the next scene coming, as it presumably looks to him like a young woman with four breasts.
""Girls in Bikinis"": Sexy young women are seen posing in bikinis to the sound of lecherous male slavering, which ends abruptly when the camera pans to Cleese reclining on a desk in a pink bikini and bow tie saying the phrase, ""And now for something completely different.""""Wanna Come Back to My Place?"": A man (Palin) tells a police inspector (Cleese) of a theft, and after an awkward silence, decides to invite said policeman to come back to his place, presumably for sex. After a moment, the policeman agrees and follows the man off.
""The Flasher"": A man (Jones) in a grubby raincoat appears to be flashing his naked body to women on the streets. He then does the same to the camera, revealing he is fully clothed, and hanging round his neck is a sign saying ""Boo!""
""Animation - American Defense/Ads"": A middle-aged secretary is consumed by hordes of yellow creatures resembling Chinese soldiers during the Cultural Revolution. The segment turns into a series of propagandist advertisements for American Defense, Crelm Toothpaste and Shrill Petrol. This segment abruptly ends when the advertiser for Shrill Petrol (voiced by Palin) is shot off-screen while overstating the effectiveness of his product.
""Animation - You'll Never Take Me Alive, Copper!"": The murderer of the Shrill Petrol advertiser hides himself in a trashcan, but is subdued when the police drop a 16-ton weight upon him, which leads to the 20th Century Frog and MGM-spoofing logos that introduce the next item. (NOTE: This animation was for ""20th Century Vole"" in the original TV version.)""Animation - Conrad Poohs and His Dancing Teeth"": An animated photograph of Gilliam, in which his teeth dance to the music of Josef Wagner's ""Under the Double Eagle"".
""Musical Mice"": Ken Ewing (Jones) has ""musical"" mice, reputedly trained to squeak at specific pitches. He announces they will play ""Three Blinded White Mice"", but he simply starts hitting them with huge mallets while humming the tune himself. His audience is enraged and chases him out of the nightclub.
""It's the Arts"": The audience chases Ewing into a television studio, interrupting a talk show (presented by Idle) in which an interviewer (Cleese), attempting to create a rapport, calls his subject - film director Sir Edward Ross (Chapman) - increasingly inappropriate nicknames: ""Ted"", ""Eddie Baby"", ""pussycat"", ""angel drawers"", and ""Frank""... claiming ""President Nixon had a hedgehog named Frank."" When he finally starts using less questionable names for his guest and the guest is finally convinced to discuss his latest film, he quickly tells him to shut up... at which point Ken Ewing reappears in the studio, still being chased by the angry mob, and escapes through an exit onto the streets.""Seduced Milkmen"": A milkman (Palin) gets seduced at the door of a house by a lovely woman (Cleveland), and follows her inside, only to get locked in a room with other milkmen, ""some of whom are very old.""
""The Funniest Joke in the World"": Ernest Scribbler (Palin), who is shown writing the revelation to the previous sketch and discarding it, has a sudden inspiration and writes a lethal joke - anyone hearing or reading it will literally ""die laughing"". It is acquired by the British army who translate it into German, creating a devastating weapon that wins the Second World War. (NOTE: This sketch is considerably shorter than in its original TV version.)
""Animation - Old Lady Waiting for the Bus"": In another link exclusive to this film, an animated man (based on a portrait of Henry VII of England, voiced by Cleese) attempts to apologize for the poor taste of the previous item, but is distracted by an animated woman flashing her nude body to him, and departs (on his fingers) to chase after her. An old woman then arrives on the scene and attempts to catch a bus, but it drives past. A second bus comes along, but it, too, drives past. When a third bus comes, the woman trips it with her foot and flips it over so she can board it.""Animation - The Killer Cars"": In an overzealous attempt to curb overpopulation, cars turn vicious and begin eating people. Eventually, a giant mutant cat is created to deal with this menace. This plan works perfectly - the city is saved - until the cat starts eating buildings. Another exclusive bit to this film alludes to a cataclysmic battle against the giant mutant cat occurs off-screen, narrated by an old man (Idle) who describes it as ""a scene of such spectacular proportions that it could never in your life be seen in a low budget film like this... if you notice, my mouth isn't moving, either.""
""Animation - Dancing Venus"": The mutant cat from the previous animation falls into a sausage grinder, with a number of other animals. The resulting ""product"" leads into the hair of Botticelli's Venus, who stands on her shell... until an arm comes out of the water and twists her nipple like a radio knob. Upbeat music plays, and Venus dances wildly until her exertions cause the shell to tip over, leading to (by way of Venus falling into a fish tank)...
""The Dead Parrot"": Eric Praline (Cleese) attempts to get a refund for his deceased parrot, but the shopkeeper (Palin) refuses to acknowledge the parrot's passing on. In another sketch that proves to be much shorter than its original TV counterpart, a twist ending has the shopkeeper revealing that he never wanted to be a pet shop owner, he always wanted to be... ""A LUMBERJACK!""""The Lumberjack Song"": The shop owner (Palin) sings about his desire to be a lumberjack, as well as his tendencies toward transvestism, the latter a revelation that both surprises and dismays his best girl (Booth) and the background singers (nine Canadian Mounties - five of whom are Chapman, Cleese, Idle, Jones and Gilliam), who ultimately storm off in disgust and pelt him with rotten fruit. As the owner leaves in defeat, in another link exclusive to this film, he passes by a group of old ladies roasting Cleese on a spit, who once again proclaims, ""And now for something completely different.""
""The Dirty Fork"": The employees of a restaurant (Jones, Palin, Idle, and Cleese) react with ever-increasing melodrama to a dirty fork given to a dining couple (Cleveland and Chapman), resulting in the horrible death of the head waiter (Idle) as well as an insane attack by the chef (Cleese). After a brief chaos, a punchline is then shown, in which Chapman turns to the camera and says ""Lucky that I didn't tell them about the dirty knife!""
""Animation - Musical Interlude"": A picture of Rodin's The Kiss appears, with the addition of several small holes along the woman's leg. The woman straightens her leg out, and the man plays her like an ocarina.""Animation - How to Build Certain Interesting Things"" (exclusive to this film): Garbage is dropped on a stage and banged repeatedly with a hammer. It takes on the shape of a wheeled arm holding a gun, which rolls into the next scene.
""Bank Robber"": A bank robber (Cleese) mistakes a lingerie shop for a bank, and attempts to rob it. After the shop owner (Idle) stymies his hopes of stealing large quantities of money, the robber is somewhat put out by his error, and makes do with a pair of panties.
""River Link"" (exclusive to this film): Cleese walks through a river to reach his desk and state (for the last time in the film), ""And now for something completely different.""
""People Falling Out of High Buildings"": An office worker (Idle) sees people falling past the window, but his co-worker (Cleese) is uninterested, until they realize there is a board meeting occurring up stairs and wager whether Parkinson will be next. A man played by Chapman then writes a letter of complaint, but just as he writes ""I have worked in tall buildings all my life, and have never once--"", an unknown force propels him screaming out of a tall building.
""Animation - The Metamorphosis"": A grimy-looking caterpillar in a trench-coat with human-like features goes to sleep and wakes up as an effeminate male butterfly.""Animation - The Three People"" (exclusive to this film): Three people walk in snow and then, one at a time, sing the title of the next sketch in harmony (sung by Jones, Palin, and Cleese).
""Vocational Guidance Counselor"": Herbert Anchovy (Palin) no longer wants to be a chartered accountant, and harbors dreams of being... ""A LION TAMER!"" The counselor (Cleese) suggests that Anchovy should instead work his way up to lion taming, via banking, an idea which Herbert initially rejects, until he is informed that the animal he thinks is a lion is in fact an anteater, and mere stock footage of a lion scares the life out of him. He desperately cries out that he just wants to see his name in lights, and his wish is granted by a magic fairy (Idle in drag with a mustache).
""Blackmail"": Herbert is initially mystified by his sudden role of hosting the television show ""Blackmail"", in which he threatens various citizens with revealing sensitive information dealing with their sex lives unless they pay him increasingly large sums of money. He gets into the idea very quickly, performing his new, albeit questionable, duty with enthusiasm and panache. (NOTE: Terry Jones makes his debut here as the nude organist, after Terry Gilliam had previously performed the role on the TV show.)""The Battle of Pearl Harbor"": The silly-hating Colonel appears again (having called in to the previous sketch due to being one of its target victims), and introduces a group of women who are members of the Batley's Townswomen's Guild (the Pythons in drag) - led by one Rita Fairbanks (Idle) - who re-enact the attack on Pearl Harbor... or, rather, beat each other with their handbags while rolling in mud.
""Romantic Interlude"": Brian and Elspet (Jones and Cleveland) begin ravishing each other on a bed, and several suggestive images are shown (an industrial chimney collapse shown in reverse, a train entering a tunnel, a torpedo being fired, etc.), but the images are actually only films being played by Brian, on a projector propped on the bed. Elspet testily asks whether he is actually going to do something or just show films all night. Brian replies with ""Just one more, dear"", and proceeds to show the next and final sketch.
""Upper Class Twit of the Year"": Five mentally deficient members of the landed gentry go through a challenging obstacle course, with such events as: walking along a straight line; jumping over a wall made of two rows of matchboxes; and slamming a car door loudly. The winner will be the first competitor to shoot himself in the head. (In the process, one twit is so inept that while attempting to back up a car, he somehow manages to run himself over.)
""Animation - End Titles:"" The end credits, rendered in Terry Gilliam's typically absurd style. The various ""characters"" seen in the credits are taken from various other animations that were seen in the series."

Hands of the Ripper,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067176/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As a young child Jack the Ripper's daughter witnesses him kill her mother. As a young woman she carries on the murderous reign of her father. A psychiatrist tries to cure her with tragic consequences. The infant daughter of Jack the Ripper is witness to the brutal murder of her mother by her father. Fifteen years later she is a troubled young woman who is seemingly possessed by the spirit of her father. While in a trance she continues his murderous killing spree but has no recollection of the events afterwards. A sympathetic psychiatrist takes her in and is convinced he can cure her condition. Soon, however, he regrets his decision.—Kevin Steinhauer <K.Steinhauer@BoM.GOV.AU> East London in Victorian England. A group of men chase Jack the Ripper back to his house. His wife realises her husband is the serial killer so he stabs her, witnessed by his infant daughter Anna from her cot. Her father hugs her as she stares at the flickering lights from the fire.At a séance the now grown-up Anna [Angharad Rees] assists her foster mother, the medium Mrs Golding [Dora Bryan], by pretending to be the voice of a spirit communicating with the dead child of a couple, Mr & Mrs Wilson [Barry Lowe & Elizabeth MacLennan]. However, she becomes upset midway through and stops speaking so the medium is forced to finish prematurely. As the guests prepare to leave, one of them, the sceptical Dr. Pritchard [Eric Porter], notices Anna's foot underneath a curtain and stands on it, revealing the hidden Anna. As they leave, Pritchard confides his disgust of charlatans like Mrs Golding to his son Michael [Keith Bell].One of the other guests, a politician named Dysart [Derek Godfrey] does not leave but pays Mrs Golding for the services of Anna. From the street Pritchard sees their shadows through the curtains. When Dysart gives Anna a jeweled broach, the flickering reflections of light send her into a trance. Dysart becomes angry and attacks her.

Dysart flees as Pritchard enters to investigate and finds Mrs Golding impaled to a door.At the police station the police inspector [Norman Bird] interviews those people who were at the séance. He is puzzled because it would have taken a very strong person to impale Mrs Golding. He establishes that Mr & Mrs Wilson left first, followed by Pritchard and Michael, but no-one saw Dysart leave. Although Pritchard knows the truth, he saves Dysart's embarrassment by stating it could have been possible for Dysart to leave shortly afterwards without anyone seeing him and that he does not believe Dysart was the man he saw leaving after the murder.At a railway station, Michael meets his blind fiancée Laura [Jane Merrow] and they return to the Pritchard's house.Pritchard visits Anna in the police cells but she does not have any memory of the murder.

One day, while on the beach boardwalk, Noah is approached by straight-laced Fred (Philip Proctor), who is entranced by her beauty, flightiness and inconsistency. Noah brings Fred home to her apartment, where she reveals to him her ""magic box,"" in which she years earlier put a wish. She explains to him that she has never opened the box, and asks him to hold it for her without ever looking inside. Despite calling her crazy, Fred agrees to her demand, charmed and fascinated.Some time later, Noah and her many hippie friends hold a Ouija board ceremony on her apartment rooftop. As the board spells out ""Hello Susan,"" Noah remembers the magician, who calls her Susan and reassures her that his friendship will help quell her loneliness. As soon as Fred joins the group, the messages cease to appear, after which he annoys the others by attempting to explain the practical, mechanical reality behind the Ouija board phenomenon. After dreamily remembering the magician's tricks, Noah instructs Fred to meet her the next day at the Natural History Museum to see the space capsule exhibit, which features a simulated trip to the moon.

Furious, Fred storms out and goes to his father's office, where he cries and considers the nature of love.At the apartment, Mitch tells Noah he may have killed his ex-girl friend, and they discuss the necessity of acting on impulses. Soon after, Mitch announces he is leaving town forever, as the magician in Noah's head tells her she cannot expect anything to remain the same.Fred soon returns to Noah and asks if she made love with Mitch. She replies that she did because he hurts her, something Fred refuses to do.

After her prostitute mother and her john are beaten to death while they are asleep in bed, teen-aged Ellie Masters is sent to an isolated orphanage run by Mrs. Deere and her handyman. Taking an avid interest in her welfare is detective Calvin Carruthers. Taking almost no interest at all, is social worker Harold Mullins who is completely under Mrs. Deere's thumb. Lots of unpleasant surprises are in store for Ellie, not the least of which is the fact that Mrs. Deere and her handyman are both brutal sadists, who run the orphanage like a concentration camp and the strong possibility that her mother's hammer-wielding killer is now stalking her.—phillindholm The film opens as an unseen assailant enters a dark house, removes a hammer from a kitchen drawer, and walks though the house to the bedroom of a sleeping man and woman. The killer uses the claw of the hammer to beat the woman to death, and the man is bludgeoned as well, his face mutilated. Then the murderer sets the room on fire. The man in the bed tries to crawl to safety, flames burning his face.Ellie Masters (Melody Patterson) wakes up screaming in bed, the opening incident being the subject of her nightmare. The murdered woman was her mother, Edna, who was a small town prostitute. The man in bed with her was her latest john, and his body has apparently not been recovered. A social worker named Mullins (Milton Selzer) has Ellie temporarily housed in a hospital, but Ellie wants to leave and go in search of her estranged father, whom she has never met. Mullins refuses, since Ellie is still a minor and technically a ward of the state, and Mullins says if she leaves, he will have to report it to the sheriff. Ellie does pack a suitcase and makes a run for it, but a mysterious man follows her in a car. He reveals himself to be Calvin Carruthers (Vic Tayback), a former theater performer and now a detective working for the county Sheriff's department. He tells Ellie he knows who she is, and that he will look out for her, and he takes her back to the hospital. Later, Calvin meets Mullins for a drink in a bar and asks about his intentions regarding Ellie. Mullins says he's placing Ellie in the Deere Youth Home, an isolated orphanage run by a recently widowed woman named Mrs. Deere (Gloria Grahame). Mullins accuses Calvin of having a prurient interest in Ellie, and Calvin admits that he'd like to make Ellie his wife because he considers her good ""breeding stock"". Mullins tells Calvin that Ellie could never be interested in him because he's too old for her, but Calvin cuts him off by revealing that he knows Mullins has an unorthodox ""business arrangement"" with Mrs. Deere where he sends certain orphans to her home. Mullins leaves in a huff.At the Deere home, a young man named Ernest attempts to escape but is interrupted by Tom Krege (Len Lesser), a sleazy looking handyman who slaps him around. When Ernest hits him back and makes a run for it, Krege grabs a huge cleaver and pursues him, eventually cutting off the boy's hand. Ernest manages to hide in a bush, and Krege assumes he escaped. Krege collects Ernest's suitcase and repacks it, placing the severed hand inside too. Back at the home, Mrs. Deere accosts Krege for allowing the boy to escape, accusing him of being drunk. She orders him to ""get the infirmary ready"" because Mullins is bringing Ellie that day. The 'infirmary' is the way Mrs. Deere explains the absence of three children who have run away from the orphanage; they were each hunted down and murdered by either Mrs. Deere or Krege, and their bodies are kept in a large walk-in freezer in the basement. The infirmary is a place to keep their bodies so Mrs. Deere can claim they are ""sick"" and have Mullins peek in on them and hopefully believe they are alive. When Krege is transporting one body, he tells Mrs. Deere that her business arrangement with him is inadequate, especially when she tells him she gets $150 a month for each child in welfare payments.Later that day, Mullins arrives with Ellie, and right away Mrs. Deere stealthily reveals that her late husband, who died only a year before, was a customer of Ellie's mother. When Mullins tries to perform a head count of the children at the orphanage, Mrs. Deere distracts him with sexual favors. Meanwhile, Ellie attempts to get to know the other children in the home. First she meets Bunch (Terri Messina), who says she is 16. Ellie sees a hunky older boy working across the yard, and Bunch tells Ellie his name is Walter (Ronald Taft), also claiming he is her boyfriend. Ellie flirts with him immediately and reveals Bunch's lie when she asks Walter directly if he and Bunch are a couple, and Walter denies it, obviously attracted to Ellie.Ellie soon discovers that Mrs. Deere runs the home like a concentration camp, rationing each child's meals and forcing them to perform hours of labor in order to ""pay their way"". She bluntly tells Ellie that her time there will be strictly managed and that the children are constantly working, except for Sundays. Mrs. Deere reveals that her husband strayed after she ""wasn't beautiful"" anymore, and she hates people who are young and beautiful, and her cruel attitude toward the children seems to be spurred by this. At dinner, Ellie overhears the other children talking about the boy who ran away, as well as several others. When Ellie tells them she saw three children in the ""infirmary"", all the kids deny that this is possible, saying they're all accounted for--except for the runaways, whom they were told never returned. A boy named Pete (Dennis Christopher) tries to steal a dinner roll by stuffing it in his shirt, but Mrs. Deere comes in and catches him, hitting him and telling him he won't eat the next day because of this. Later, Ellie discovers a girl imprisoned in the attic named Jennifer (Maggie Corey), one of the runaways who was recovered. Jennifer is weak and delirious, moaning that she is thirsty and wants water. Ellie goes to get her a glass, but is caught by Krege, who makes a vague but ominous threat about her getting involved.Carruthers visits Ellie at the home and frightens Mrs. Deere by telling her he would like to search the entire house to look for the runaway Ernest, but he allows Mrs. Deere and Krege to talk him out of the idea. Ellie has a private conversation with him where she tells him about the other kids who have run away, but Carruthers tells her she has to stay because her mother's murderer may still be after her, and being hidden away in an orphanage is a great place to hide. Mrs. Deere goes into the attic with a glass of water and torments Jennifer, drinking the water right in front of her and abandoning her in the dark.Ellie and Bunch get into a conflict over Walter, who repeatedly dismisses Bunch as ""too young"" while spending time courting Ellie. Ellie tells Walter about her suspicions regarding Mrs. Deere and her sociopathic behavior, pointing out several truths to him, but he stubbornly refuses to believe anything is the matter. Krege lures Ellie into the basement by telling her that he knows a way she can escape, but when she agrees to meet him there, he tries to rape her instead. Meanwhile, Walter sees them and goes straight to Mrs. Deere and tells her. Mrs. Deere interrupts and ""saves"" Ellie, promising her she'll be punished, but she also confronts Krege and tries to fire him. Krege, however, blackmails her into splitting her ill-gotten welfare gains 50/50, which Mrs. Deere is forced to do when Krege promises to go to the police otherwise. Mrs. Deere ""confides"" in her dead husband, whose body she is keeping in the walk-in freezer, and she acts as if everything she does at the orphanage is under his direction. When she sends Ellie to clean up the shed, she tells Ellie that she thinks one day medical science will advance to the point where people who have died will be ""restored"", although Ellie doesn't realize yet that she's keeping dead bodies in the freezer. When Ellie is alone, Walter comes in and admits that he was the one who ratted Ellie out to Mrs. Deere, and for some reason Ellie confides in Walter that she is planning on running away. She even finds Ernest's abandoned suitcase (which still contains his severed hand), and she keeps it in anticipation of making an escape (without looking inside first, though).Meanwhile, a bizarre figure begins to lurk around the orphanage, a lumbering bald man in a plaid shirt and with a face that appears to be deformed or burned. As Ellie sleeps, she awakens to see the man hovering over her bed, brandishing a hammer. When she screams, Mrs. Deere and the others come running but the man is gone. Mrs. Deere tells Ellie she just had a nightmare, but Ellie insists it was real. The next day, Bunch arranges for Ellie to catch her seducing Walter in the shed, and Ellie angrily storms off, telling Walter she's leaving the orphanage. Walter goes to Mrs. Deere and tells her that Ellie intends to escape, and Mrs. Deere confronts Ellie, who tells her she'd rather leave the home than stay and be murdered by the hammer-wielding madman. In turn, Mrs. Deere locks Ellie in her room and plots with Krege to kill her by locking her in the freezer. Their plan is foiled by Pete, who accidentally sees Krege kidnapping Ellie and putting her in the basement freezer. Once inside, Ellie discovers the bodies of the runaway children hanging from meathooks, and she faints. Pete tells Bunch about what he saw, and convinces her to investigate with him, but Bunch doesn't hear anything in the locked freezer and leaves.Suddenly Mullins shows up and demands to search the home, having learned about supposed runaway children from Calvin Carruthers. Mrs. Deere and Krege lure him down to the basement, where Krege strikes him in the back with a cleaver and kills him. They open the freezer to put him inside and are suddenly attacked by the grotesque stranger, who fights Krege with his hammer. Ellie revives and escapes, although Mrs. Deere sees her at the last minute and tries to stop her. Ellie runs outside, where the other kids are working, and tells them what happened to her. Walter becomes furious with her, screaming at her about how she is overreacting, but Pete confirms what she says. Ellie runs off, encouraging everyone else to do the same. Pete wants to join her, but all of the other kids just stand there and stare. Walter points out that they have no place to go.In the basement, the disfigured man strikes a death blow to Krege's head and runs off after Ellie, leaving Mrs. Deere alone. It seems as if Mrs. Deere's problems are over, now that Krege has been mortally wounded and Ellie has the madman chasing after her. Mrs. Deere drags Krege by his legs into the freezer, where she tells him she intends to leave him, to ""save"" him. He begs her not to leave him in there to die, but she tells him ""Why Tom, all your friends are here!"" But before she can leave, Jennifer appears in the doorway of the freezer, staring at Mrs. Deere, who screams in horror as Jennifer slams the door, locking her inside the freezer.Outside, Ellie is running through the woods with the madman close behind. She attempts to hide in a bush and discovers Ernest's decomposing body. Her screams summon the madman, who runs up to her brandishing the hammer. Ellie suddenly screams at him that she didn't mean to hurt him, she only meant to hurt her mother, revealing that Ellie herself was the one who murdered Edna. Knowing that she herself was the killer, Ellie thinks the disfigured man is Edna's john who was in bed with her that night, badly burned and out for revenge. But the man removes the grotesque face to reveal Calvin underneath. He reveals that he caught on to the truth about Ellie when he discovered the real john's body within crawling distance of the burned house. He just wanted to force Ellie to confess to him that she was the killer all along. Ellie is confused when he says he doesn't want to arrest her, he wants to marry her. ""If you were my wife, I couldn't turn you in, it wouldn't be loyal."" Ellie balks at first, due to their drastic age difference, but she relents when Calvin threatens to arrest her if she doesn't comply. Defeated, Ellie smiles at Calvin and says ""Well, my other always told me that older men make the best husbands."" In a final twist, Calvin tells her, ""I bet your mother never told you that I was the first man who ever made love to her."" Ellie collapses in shock and hysterics, realizing that her own father has deliberately sought her out, not with the intention to 'rescue' her but to marry her and have children with her."

On the Buses,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067528/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the bus company finds itself short-staffed, Inspector Blake comes up with the brilliant idea of employing female drivers. The company is delighted, but the bus crews are horrified and try to get rid of the women. Stan gets a little annoyed when his mum and sister keep buying expensive items on hire-purchase, but the money he earns for overtime working as a bus driver means that he can afford it... just. His job is secure, as bus drivers are hard to come by, and his overtime prospects are good, until the bus company decide to revoke a long-standing rule and employ female bus drivers. Aghast at the thought of no overtime and, therefore, fewer wages, he joins forces with his long-time work colleague Jack to sabotage the new female employees.—Rhino <rhino@blueyonder.co.uk> This is the first in the trilogy of movies based on the British sitcom from the '60's and '70's. In this one Stan, needing the overtime pay because of the number of hire purchase-items at his home tries, with the help of Jack, to oust the new female drivers who have been brought in because of staffing problems. Stan Butler is a public transit bus driver with the Town and District Bus Co. in suburban London. He is paired with his best friend Jack Harper as his conductor, they partners in crime in the pursuit of the opposite sex which is usually foremost on their minds. They also treat their bus like their own personal service, which is much to the exasperation of their bumbling inspector, Mr. Blake, more commonly referred to as Blakey. Stan still lives at ""home"" with his Mum, his plain Jane sister Olive who has no discernible skill at anything whatsoever, and Olive's lazy and stingy husband Arthur. With all Stan's overtime due to a labor shortage at the company, the Butlers have been on a spending spree of late for major items for the household. That spending spree comes to an abrupt end when Blakey implements a new directive to fill those job vacancies which kiboshes Stan's overtime: hire female drivers, driving which has up to this point been the sole domain of the male gender. What is worse for Stan and Jack is that most of the new female hires proverbially possess excess testosterone. Olive ends up playing an important role in especially Stan's need to maintain that overtime. So Stan and Jack embark on a mission to put the new female hires in a bad light so that they will ultimately be let go.—Huggo"

They are shocked to find that, wherever he has been, certain unsolved murders have taken place.

Believing they have killed her, the group return home, unaware that their friend is now a Vampire.—Rhino <rhino@blueyonder.co.uk> Richard Fountain [Patrick Mower], Oxford University's authority on Greek mythology,
is in Greece researching Minoan rites when word comes back that Fountain
has become chummy with people involved in drugs, orgiastic rituals, and
possibly a rash of murders. Since Richard is the son of an English foreign
secretary and the almost-fiancé of Penelope Goodrich [Madeline Hind], daughter of
Lancaster College's provost, Walter Goodrich [Peter Cushing], Investigator Tony Seymour [Alex Davion]
has been summoned to find Richard and bring him back to England. Tony
leaves immediately for Greece, accompanied by Richard's almost-fiance, his
student Bob Kirby [Johnny Sekka], and Major Derek Longboy [Patrick McNee] of the British Attache. About
the only thing that is known about Richard's status is that he left
England a virgin and, much to Penelope's dismay, he's taken up with a
woman named Chriseis Konstantanini [Imogen Hassal].Tony sends a telegram to Richard's villa in Mykonos, advising him of
their arrival on Thursday, but Richard apparently does not wish to see
them, as he immediately vacates the premises, sending his ""saviors"" on a
wild goose chase to find him. All they have to go on is a note found in
Richard's room, in which he mentions the city of Hydra. They contact
Colonel Stavros [David Lodge] of Greek Intelligence for help. Stavros places a
helicopter at their disposal, and they fly to Hydra, then take a land
rover to the Monastery of the Blood of Christ. There, the abbot admits to
having recently treated Richard for an ancient sickness having ""to do with
the blood."" Unfortunately, Richard is no longer at the monastery. Those
who brought him have carried him off again in the direction of a nearby
fort.While they are interviewing the abbot, Penelope begins to feel ill.
They write it off as too much wine and sun but decide to leave her behind
at the monastery while they follow the mule trail up the mountain to the
fort. When they arrive, they find that they have stumbled on the
beginnings of a ritual. Chriseis and her followers escape, taking the
mules. Richard is there, too, but he is in some sort of trance. Without
the mules, the search party is forced to remain the night, intending for
Derek to return to the monastery early the next morning and get Penelope
off the island while Tony and Bob attempt to carry Richard down the
mountain and back to the monastery.During the night, Richard comes out of the trance. He admits to still
being a virgin but explains that Chriseis' influence over him is very
strong. Even now, they must watch out for her, he says, as Chriseis will
be back. The next morning, Richard is still too weak to travel, so the
plan changes such that Derek will have to bring in the helicopter in order
to transport Richard. Richard refuses to allow Derek to leave. He requests
that they first carry him outside. There, he shouts a prayer to the gods,
asking for protection for Derek and the others. As a sign, Richard sees an
eagle swooping. Based on the number of the swoops, Richard predicts that
one of their party will die before they can get back to Hydra.Derek makes it down the mountain okay and sees Penelope off at the
dock. Unfortunately, on the way down he was seen by Chriseis who, seeing
Derek leaving, is making her way back to the fort. Derek is not far behind
and trying to catch up with her. Chriseis starts a rockslide, which knocks
Derek over a cliff. Hanging on for dear life, Derek screams loudly. Tony
and Bob rush to his aid, leaving Richard alone in the fort. Chriseis takes
this moment to slip in and drink Richard's blood. When Tony and Bob sense
her presence, Bob goes back to help Richard, while Tony tries
unsuccessfully to pull Derek back over the cliff. Bob and Chriseis
struggle, but Chriseis falls down a flight of stairs and appears to be
dead. Bob attempts to put a cane through her heart, but Tony stops him
before it turns from an accident into a murder.Richard, Bob, and Tony return to England, where Richard takes up his
studies again at Oxford and marries Penelope. But the pressures placed on
him by Provost Goodrich cause Richard to remain impotent and to revive
memories of Chriseis. Bob senses that Richard is backsliding and sends for
Tony's help. Tony arrives on the day of Richard's address at Lancaster
College's quincentenary dinner. After the opening prayers and while the
quests dine on the traditional boar's head and peacock with feathers,
Richard begins to deliver his welcome-back speech. He winds up causing a
riot when he accuses the academic world of ""leeching on"" and ""possessing""
the minds, souls, and bodies of the academics as well as their students.
He points to all the ""smooth deceivers"" dressed in their scarlet gowns,
and fingers Goodrich as the worst of all.While the academics compose themselves, Richard leads Penelope to his
office where he is finally able to experience sexual freedom by ripping
off her bodice and drinking blood from her neck. Tony and Bob break
Richard away from Penelope's neck. Richard attempts to flee over the
rooftops but goes skittering off, impaling himself on the wrought iron
fence below. Provost Goodrich tearfully pronounces their deaths as due to
""suicide"", but Bob and Tony complete the act by driving stakes through
Richard and Penelope's hearts. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

He also intends to take a new wife, while feeding his bevy of female vampires. No grave can suppress pure evil, and after the blood-stained events ofCount Yorga, Vampire (1970), the malevolent overlord of the damned returns from beyond, revived by a mysterious, mystical force. This time, innocence attracts the eternal bloodsucker, who, after having acquired the old Gateway Mansion, picks up where he left off, terrorising the nearby orphanage along with his always-thirsty harem of fanged mistresses. Then, the suave Bulgarian vampire has a chance encounter with lovely Cynthia, and just like that, an intense feeling of unprecedented affection emerges. Is Cynthia the one? Can the abominable Count Yorga share eternity with the beautiful, blonde-haired girl?—Nick Riganas NOTE: Sequel to ""Count Yorga"" (1970).Count Yorga [Robert Quarry] has purchased the old Gateway Mansion and moved in with his harem of vampiresses. His property is near that of the Westwood Orphanage, and the vampires have already bitten Tommy [Philip Frame], one of the children, and turned him into a good little renfield.Everyone at the orphanage is uneasy. The Santa Ana winds are coming, the bridge is out, and tonight is the annual fundraiser. The guests are few. There is Cynthia Nelson [Mariette Hartley] and her family -- father Bill [Walter Brooke], mother Liza [Helen Baron], and two sisters, Jennifer [Yvonne Wilder], who is deaf, and Ellen [Karen Ericson]. Also, there is Ellen's fiance Jason Baldwin [David Lampson], his father Dr David Baldwin [Roger Perry], who is Cynthia's beau, and only about a half dozen others, so it is a noticeable event when Count Yorga drops in. It is also a big event for Yorga because, when he meets Cynthia, he finds himself falling in love.When the Santa Anas hit, the Nelson family plus Tommy hole themselves up in their living room, except for Jennifer who is sleeping upstairs. As they attempt to make small talk, the patio door suddenly breaks, and a half dozen vampiresses enter and start biting. They carry Cynthia to Yorga. Yorga hypnotizes her and makes her believe that she was in a car accident near his house and that he has been nursing her back to health. The next morning, when Jennifer wakes up, she finds the carnage. Only Tommy is still alive, but he's not talking. Jennifer and Tommy go to the orphanage to tell Reverend Thomas [Tom toner], who immediately contacts Dr Baldwin, Jason, Lt Ben Madden [Rudy de Luca], and Sgt O'Connor [Craig Nelson]. When they all return to the house, however, there is no mess, no broken patio doors, and not a body to be found. Instead, they find a note from Cynthia saying that the family had to leave on urgent business and would return in several days. Although Jennifer insists that what she is saying is the truth, Tommy claims to have seen the Nelsons leave and did not see any destruction. With nothing to go on, the investigation is halted. Only the fact that Mitzi Carthay [Jesse Wells] was found after the fundraiser with two marks on her neck keeps Dr Baldwin's mind open to the possibility of vampirism.Cynthia is beginning to feel better and wants to call her parents but can find no phone. She starts having flashbacks in which she sees parts of the massacre and remembers the bodies of her family lying on the floor. When she tries to get away, she discovers that all the doors are locked and concludes that she is being held captive. When she asks Yorga why he is holding her, he kisses her. Dr Baldwin is becoming more and more convinced that there might be a vampire about, and he suspects it is Yorga. He goes to speak with the Professor Rightstat [George Macready], expert on folklore and cults, but he is of no help. When Mitzi's boyfriend Joe [Michael Pataki] is murdered and the same marks found on his neck, Baldwin asks Lt Madden for a blood sample so that he can have it checked for human saliva, but Madden refuses. When a photo taken of Yorga at the fundraising festival comes out blank, Baldwin can wait no more. He puts together a team of vampire hunters, composed of himself, Lt Madden, Sgt O'Connor, and the Reverend. Their plan is to for the Rev to keep Yorga occupied while the others search the mansion. However, the vampire hunters get knocked off one by one. First to go is the Reverend. While walking in the garden with Yorga and talking about making a donation to the orphanage, Yorga leads the Rev into a patch of quicksand. Next to go is Sgt O'Connor when he gets trapped in a room with the vampiresses. Third is Lt Madden when Tommy stabs him. Only Baldwin and Cynthia are left. Baldwin leads her around from room to room, hallway to hallway, outrunning the vampiresses at every turn until they become trapped. Cynthia goes with Yorga, while the vampiresses advance on Baldwin.Cut to Yorga and Cynthia. Just as Yorga is about to bite into Cynthia's neck, Baldwin grabs a hatchet off the wall. He chases Yorga up to the roof. They tussle around a bit. Just as Baldwin is about to go over the railing, Cynthia regains her memory and sinks the hatchet into Yorga's heart. Baldwin gives Yorga the final push that sends him plummeting to the ground below. Baldwin then turns to a relieved Cynthia who finds that Baldwin has been turned into a vampire. Only Tommy is left, playing ball on the front lawn. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

He calls a strike for almost any minor incident - or because he wants time off to attend a local football match. Sid Plummer (Sid James) is the site foreman bridging the gap between workers and management, shrewdly keeping the place going amid the unrest.Prissy product designer Charles Coote (Charles Hawtrey) has included a bidet in his latest range of designs, but W.C. objects to the manufacture of such ""distasteful"" items. W.C. won't change his stance even after his son, Lewis (Lew) Boggs (Richard O'Callaghan), secures a large overseas order for the bidets.

The Seven Minutes,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067736/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Seven Minutes is a steamy book written in 1969. To help with an upcoming election, a bookstore clerk is indicted for selling obscene material and most of the film centers about the trial. The defense attorneys need to find the mystery of the original publication of the book.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In Oakwood, California, police raid the Argus Bookstore, which has been selling The Seven Minutes, a new, second edition of a book banned during the 1930s . Under orders from District Attorney Elmo Duncan (Philip Carey), the bookstore's day manager, Ben Fremont (Robert Maloney), is arrested on an obscenity charge. Phil Sanford (Tom Selleck), who has recently taken over from his father the company that publishes the book, hires lawyer Mike Barrett (Wayne Maunder) to handle Ben's case.During negotiations with Elmo, Mike points out that the book, which is not hardcore pornography, has received artistic commendations. Although he has no personal objection to the book, Elmo is feeling political pressure from wealthy Olivia St. Clair and her Strength Through Decency League. He and Mike compromise by allowing Ben to plead guilty in exchange for a token fine and suspended sentence, which will result in the book being banned in Oakwood, but available in the rest of the county.Afterward, Elmo explains to Luther Yerkes (Jay C. Flippen), the millionaire supporting his plans to run for senator, that he needs a bigger issue than convicting a bookseller to win votes. Meanwhile, George Perkins (Billy Durkin) violently injures and rapes Sheri Moore in the presence of the emotionally unstable teenager Jerry Griffith (John Sarno).When Jerry is arrested for the crime after his wallet is found at the crime scene, the police chief calls Elmo, whose political party is heavily supported by Jerry's wealthy father Frank, and mentions that The Seven Minutes was found in Jerry's car. Luther immediately recognizes that The Seven Minutes is the ""key issue"" Elmo needs to further his political career. Despite Jerry's insistence that he did not hurt Sheri, the older men, with Frank's approval, scheme for him to plead guilty, essentially putting the book on trial for inciting a young man to commit a sex crime. Only one person believes in Jerry's innocence, his cousin Maggie Russell (Marianne McAndrew), who lives at the Griffith house.After Elmo reneges on their agreement, Mike and his partner, Clay Rutherford, meet with Phil to discuss a new defense built on proving that the author, the late J. J. Jadway, intended to write serious artistic fiction and ask Christian Leroux, the publisher of the first edition, to testify to its artistic integrity.When Oakwood librarian Rachel Hoit, who opposes the League's censorship attempts, tells Mike that Perkins is a friend of Jerry, Perkins denies it and feigns disapproval of rape. Meanwhile, Cardinal McManus offers Elmo the assistance of Father Sarsatti, the priest in charge of the Vatican's classified information about the book.At a Strength Through Decency League rally, Elmo gives a fiery speech about decadence and refers to Constance Cumberland, a famous retired actress who is seated on the dais with him, as a person who represents a time of higher morals. Mike is attending the rally with his fiancee, Faye Osborn, the daughter of a prominent television executive who is a major donor to Elmo's political party. When he spots Maggie leaving the premises, Mike tries to talk to her, but she rebuffs him.After psychiatrist Dr. Trimble, who was hired by Luther, reports that Jerry's behavior indicates conflicting emotions about the rape, Luther has television newscaster Merle Reid film an interview with Jerry. After goading Jerry into losing his composure, Reid pointedly warns his viewers about ""killer books."" Trimble, who had opposed the interview, then resigns over Reid's tactics.Reid's national broadcast inflames the public and incites Sheri's father to accost Mike. While trailing Jerry, Mike sees him argue with Perkins at a nightclub and then follows him to a parking garage, where he prevents Jerry from committing suicide. Later, at the hospital, the grateful Maggie agrees to talk to Mike, and after telling him about a housekeeper who worked for the family, confides that she considers The Seven Minutes a ""beautiful book."" Despite her growing attraction to Mike, she cuts off further communication to avoid a conflict of interests.The next morning, Mike meets with the housekeeper, who agrees to testify about the troubled atmosphere in the Griffith household. However, Faye, who resents Mike's involvement in the case, sabotages his progress by reporting it to her father and then breaks up with Mike. Soon after, Clay reports that the housekeeper refuses to testify and that Leroux has been paid to testify against the book. In addition, potential evidence, in the form of letters outlining Jadway's literary vision, mysteriously disappears when it is bought by an impostor posing as Mike.After an intruder breaks into the law office and knocks out Mike, the lawyer discovers that his phones have been monitored. For the trial of California vs. Fremont, Luther hires several witnesses to denounce The Seven Minutes , among them, an eccentric publisher, Paul Van Fleet, who reveals an incriminating, secondhand anecdote about Jadway told by literary scholar Dr. Hiram Eberhart. Farther Sarsatti reports that the Catholic Church considers the book immoral, and Leroux claims that other countries have banned the book. After a statistician provides testimony about the ""average woman,"" smug Mrs. White, supposedly representing the average housewife, claims the book is ""sickeningly obscene.""That evening after the court recesses, Clay realizes that details in the Eberhart anecdote occurred after Jadway's reported death. Suspecting that Jadway is alive, Mike flies to New York to interview Eberhart, who refers him to Jadway's friend, poet O'Flanagan. Although evasive with Mike, O'Flanagan mentions Cassie McGraw, Jadway's alleged girl friend. Believing that she can find Cassie, Maggie makes a deal to look for her if Mike will agree not to cross-examine Jerry. In court, under Elmo's questioning, Jerry admits that The Seven Minutes sexually aroused him, but when Mike declines a cross-examination, the surprised judge declares a recess.After discovering Maggie's involvement with Mike, Frank throws her out of his house, but she sneaks back in to retrieve a postcard from a friend reporting Cassie's whereabouts. Mike flies to the Chicago sanitarium mentioned in the postcard, but finds that Cassie is too senile to help him. However, he obtains a lead from a nurse, who tells him that Cassie receives flowers from an Oakwood florist every year on her birthday. Maggie, who knows the florist, learns that the flowers are from Constance. Maggie then visits Constance, who tells her that Cassie was her former secretary and complains about the way Frank, a longtime acquaintance, has treated Jerry over the years.Back in the courtroom, Mike calls Constance to the stand, where she eventually reveals that she wrote The Seven Minutes under a pseudonym to protect her film career. Explaining how the book's seven chapters reflect the seven minutes it takes for a woman to have an orgasm, Constance says she wrote the book to describe the woman's point of view during sexual intercourse in order to help the love of her life, an impotent man. With the book, she had hoped to liberate people like Jerry from fear, guilt and shame. Constance states that she has recently talked to Jerry, who confided to her that Sheri wanted to make love with him, but, being impotent, he was unable to complete the act. After eliciting Constance's testimony, Mike wins the case.Following the trial, Constance tells reporters that O'Flanagan wrote a fake obituary for ""Jadway"" and Cassie arranged a memorial service for her. In the parking garage, Elmo congratulates Mike, but then haughtily claims that the book is a dangerous influence and that he intends to prosecute Jerry as an accomplice to the rape. Equally inflamed, Mike calls Elmo a hypocritical opportunist, who connives for the benefit of himself.Later, in the car, Maggie says that she and Constance talked to Jerry, whose revelation that Perkins was the rapist convinced her to testify. At Maggie's suggestion, Mike proceeds swiftly to his apartment, where they intend to have an intimate victory celebration."

Henry makes Bettina the Lady in waiting & transfers her to the palace to have sex with her. But Bettina spends all of her time with the pregnant Marie & Henry still doesn't get any. Henry is torn between the lust Bettina and the 50,000 gold coins & hence keeps oscillating between a confession & a retraction from Lodgerley.Henry finally gives in to his lust, gets the confession & marries Bettina.

A backwoods Bible-quoting Foghorn Leghorn-ish con man who believes in free love and moon-shining runs into trouble with the locals when a series of gruesome religious murders are committed: a new bride is raped off-screen, a woman is stoned and two others are crucified.—MG Roscoe Boone is a backwater, Bible-quoting, con artist/preacher who runs a moonshine distillery in a rural Deep South town and whom controls his illegal business with a posse of redneck thugs who manufacture and traffic his moonshine whiskey and participate in his drinking sermons. But while Boone's business has support from half of the townspeople, the other half are against him especially when his preaching of drinking, free love and open marriage had led to the recent gang-rape of a young bride on her wedding day. Things get more complicated with the arrival of two Federal agents from the state capital whom threaten to shut down Boone's whiskey still for a variety of felony charges. But in another turn of events, one of Boone's most loyal followers goes on a killing spree after apparently taking Preacher Boone's bible quotes a bit too far, starting with the stoning of the young bride, and then the crucification of two other young women.—matt-282 In the backwoods of the rural South, Rev. Roscoe Boone believes that the scripture ""I shall drink the spirit of the Lord"" should be taken literally and consequently, dispenses moonshine along with his sermons at his church, the Congregation of the Heavenly Spirits. The church also advocates the tenet of free love, and so, at the marriage ceremony of congregants Mary Ellen and Zeke, the reverend invites the congregations male members to have sex with Mary Ellen as the strains of 'Here Comes the Bride' plays in the background.Later, at a business meeting between the reverend and his girlfriend Elsie along with Grady, Sam and Turnip, his associates in the ""White Lightnin'"", moonshine still, the group divides the profits and plots to put their competition, the local liquor store, out of business. Soon after, the reverend enters the store and after denouncing it as a place of sin, proceeds to smash several liquor bottles onto the floor.That night at the Congregation of Heavenly Spirits, as the parishioners drink, sing and dance, government agents Markel and Clark arrive to confiscate the whiskey for the bootleggers' failure to pay federal taxes. Claiming that he is dispensing cough syrup, not spirits, the reverend disarms the agents, then pours a healthy dose of moonshine down the throat of the humorless Markel. After Markel passes out, the reverend aims one of the agents pistols at Clark and forces him to have sex with Janet, one of the parishioners, while Bubba photographs the proceedings. Afterward, the reverend threatens to use the photos to blackmail Clark, a happily married man, unless he swears that the moonshine was cough medicine. Later, on her way home from church, Mary Ellen is stoned to death by an unseen assailant.The next day after Turnip, a notoriously bad driver, drives off on his moonshine run, word comes of Mary Ellen's death. As Turnip speeds along, he is chased by a police car, and while trying to outrun it, crashes his car, causing his cargo of moonshine to explode, incinerating Turnip in the ensuing conflagration.Later, the Rev. Boone presides over Mary Ellen's funeral service, intoning the Biblical admonition let he who is without sin cast the first stone. At Turnip's funeral, the reverend proclaims his late business associate a burnt sacrifice of the Lord. At the next congregation, the reverend summons Turnip's son Carter to the church to invite him to take his father's place. When Carter's prim and proper fiancee Lynn objects, however, Carter turns down the reverend's offer. After Carter and Lynn leave, two young women whose car has broken down enter the church to ask for help. However, when one of the women threatens to expose the still, the reverend encourages Bubba and Beau, another member of his flock, to ravish them.The next morning, as the congregation steps out of the church, they find the women's dead bodies, each nailed to a cross embedded in the church yard. Meanwhile, Carter, who is trying to save money to attend college in Chicago, decides to quit his low-paying construction job and accept the reverend's offer.To put the moonshiners out of business, Agent Clark arranges for a local distiller to produce ""White Lightnin',"" which the liquor store then sells at a lower cost than the reverend's $3-a-jug brand. Outraged at being undercut, the reverend appears at the liquor store accompanied by his lawyer, Samuel B. Grimes, who serves the owners with a cease and desist order based on the trumped-up charge that Sam was poisoned by a bottle of ""White Lightnin',"" he bought at the store. To strengthen his case, the reverend then instructs Bubba to feign that he was also poisoned by the liquor. Worried about government surveillance, Carter has second thoughts and decides to quit his job.As he turns in the keys to his car, Clark and the sheriff arrive to arrest Sam and Bubba as frauds. Learning that the reverend is next on their list, Carter hurries to warn Boone and talks him into shutting down the still if Clark will agree to drop the charges. When Clark and the police arrive, Carter convinces him to free Rev. Boone, Sam and Bubba in exchange for closing the still and destroying the incriminating negatives of Clark having sex with Janet; Clark agrees to the deal. When the Sheriff complains that they drove out to Boone's residence for nothing and without making an arrest, Clark intimidates Rev. Boone into giving one jug of ""cough syrup"" to the sheriff as a means to please him.After the law officers drive away, Boone tells Carter that he doesn't know whether to thank him or curse at him for getting all of them out of trouble, but that since it is done, Boone will fulfill his promise to close the still and allow Carter and Lynn to leave town to begin a new life for themselves. Just then Grady, blaming Carter for ruining his livelihood, announces that he is going to kill him. Aiming his shotgun at Carter, Grady admits to killing Mary Ellen and the two other women. As the reverend tries to wrestle the shotgun from Grady, the weapon fires, discharging a round of ammunition directly into Grady's face, killing him instantly. The congregation of Carter, Lynn, Elsie, Bubba and Sam then encircles Grady's bloody body as Rev. Boone looks up to the skies and prays for his soul reciting the 23rd Psalm.The End."

He uses his skill to pursue them in hopes of finding them for his own financial gain. The children must rely on their wits and the kindness of strangers to stay ahead of him or their lives will be in mortal jeopardy.—Anonymous Following the passing of their mother, thirteen year old Finn Dove and seven year old Derval Dove become the ward of their cruel stepfather, Tobias Cromwell, who only wants what menial labor the children can provide for his home, rather than their loving maternal grandmother, Mary Magdalene St. Bridget O'Flaherty, the English court ruling largely due to the fact of the children already living with ""Uncle Toby"" in Liverpool, while Granny O'Flaherty lives in rural County Galway, Ireland. Dreaming of living with Granny, the children decide to run away to Galway County to be with her. The start of their journey is before they are able to discover that they are heirs to an estate, that substantial amount of money which will otherwise go to their maternal Uncle John Cyril Dove - an actor with the stage name Hawk Dove due to the hawk tattooed on his right inner wrist - if the children cannot be found. Learning that he will control the money until the children reach an age of majority, Uncle Toby enlists the assistance of a detective to get the children back, he in turn offering a small fraction of the inheritance as a reward. As mean as Uncle Toby is, Uncle Hawk is even worse as he is willing to kill the children to get the inheritance if he can find them. What is working in Uncle Hawk's favor is that he, as an actor, is a master of disguise, the only thing that may give him away under any of those disguises being the tattoo. Through it all, Granny hopes and prays the children make it to her loving home. The children get into one misadventure after another as they try to make their way Granny, while trying to evade the police, Uncle Toby and his detective, and Uncle Hawk. The children have to learn who to trust and not to trust, especially as they, without much money, have to learn how to survive on the road. Even if they can make it to Galway County, their story may not have a happy ending as they are still legally a ward of Uncle Toby in the eyes of the law, and as Finn states they may never be rid of potentially murderous Uncle Hawk, even if they are attending his funeral.—Huggo"

It's the not too distant past in the working class Eastern Townships of Quebec. In the approach to Christmas, much of the focus of the town is on the general store, owned and operated by Antoine and Cecile, the former who also acts as the town's undertaker. The focus on the store is due to the Christmas shopping by the townsfolk and their want to see the nativity display in the store's window. Fernand, who works as a clerk in the store, has a secret focus of his own. Also working in the store is teenager Carmen, whose wages go to her abusive father. Because her father does not want her beyond her money earning ability, Carmen lives at the store with Cecile and Antoine. But quietly behind the scenes is the ever seeing Benoit, Cecile and Antoine's nephew who also works at the store and who in his pubescent state is in lust with Carmen. The one person who they probably will not see this Christmas season is Jos Poulin. Like all the other men in town, Jos worked in the asbestos mine, which he hated. As such, he has since left his loving wife Elise and his five children behind to go work in a logging camp. But real life still happens in the Poulin family during his absence, a specific situation which Antoine and Benoit must deal with and which threatens to expose the insecurities in the primarily publicly stoic Antoine.—Huggo"

"1,000 Convicts and a Woman",1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066731/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The daughter of a British prison governor returns from an American finishing school and chases after the inmates of her dad's prison. Angela Thorne (Alexandra Hay) is a 17-year-old school girl who arrives at an English airport from America. Paul Floret (Sandor Elès), her father's driver collects her there. In the car, Angela is flirty and begins to undress in the back seat causing Floret to stop short. She has shed her school girl outfit for a short mini skirt. They arrive at H.M. Prison Greybourne where her father (Neil Hallett) is the prison governor. He also resides on the grounds. Angela asks Paul what was his crime. Paul, who is quiet, replies he killed a woman by talking her to death.
Angela is dropped at her warden father's office at the prison. She is greeted by old friend Ralph Daly (Robert Brown) who she used to call ""Uncle Ralph."" She convinces him to seek out her father who is giving a tour to governing magistrates on a prison inspection. The prison now operates with minimum security where prisoners roam with some freedom and have jobs around the facility. Angela turns heads wherever she goes. Her widowed father is surprised to see her in the prison block, and offer a stern greeting in front of the magistrates and send her to the house. Angela has not been home since she was 13. She and her father have a distant relationship.
Eyes of many men, both convicts and guards, follow Angela as she walks to her house. Mrs. Jackson (Stella Tanner), her father's housekeeper, greets Angela at the house. She questions Angela about her altered school uniform. Meanwhile, Warden Thorne and Daly discuss the surprise of finding his daughter while working. Thorne continues his duties rather than return to the house. Mrs. Jackson explains to Angela that there is no television in the house because her father simply wouldn't take the time to watch it. Bored, Angela starts drinking her father's alcohol but when he arrives, she claims she has poured him a drink. With six new prisoners entering the next day, Warden Thorne will have no time for Angela. Since Angela s clothes do not fit and are out of fashion, Thorne offers his driver to take Angela shopping the next day.
Angela dresses sexy and flirts with Paul who is just two months away from leaving the prison and wants to keep his nose clean. On the ride back from shopping, Angela steals the car keys and stops the car. Angela heads into the woods being flirtatious but finally gives up with seducing straightlaced Paul. She throws the keys down a hillside, finds a place to sit down and smokes pot.
That night, prisoner Carl Maxwell (Harry Baird) sees Angela topless in her bedroom window. Unable to sleep, Angela goes for a walk and is stopped by Forbus (Fredric Abbott) on night patrol. She notices he has been drinking, and threatens to tell her father and subsequently seduces him. The next morning, Angela flirts with Paul in the auto shop. She wants Paul to drive her to the stables to ride her horse Shamrock. After the ride, Angela explains to Paul she gets like a fever, that needs relief. Then she begs Paul to make love to her. He rejects her, telling her she is sick.
When they return, Warden Thorne can sense the anger between Paul and Angela. Angela immediately invents a story that satisfies her father's curiosity. Angela finds Carl, a black man who works in the motor pool as a mechanic, by a tree and flirts with him. Then Angela sneaks into prisoners' dormitory. She notices Gribney (David Bauer), a prisoner who picked up her handkerchief she had dropped to draw attention to herself. She teases him by undoing her pants but then quickly refastens them and runs off. He chases her through the woods. When they get to the shops and recreation area, Gribney lunges for her and hits his head. Then Gribney tackles Angela and starts to rape her. Angela screams. Guards, prisoners and Warden Thorne race to her rescue. Gribney accuses Angela of wanting it. Carl defends Angela and knocks him out cold.
Later, Mrs. Jackson scolds Angela and advises her not to return to the prison grounds saying she is mixed up. Angela provides Mrs. Jackson her comprehensive psychological profile as a bisexual nymphomaniac and exhibitionist as proof she knows exactly who she is. At the prison, Angela tries to blend in with the visitors who are seeing inmates that day. She learns that Linda (Tracy Reed) is there to visit Floret. Then, she bothers Carl at the motor pool. She antagonizes Paul while riding her bike. She gets physical pleasure from riding her bicycle.
That evening, Gribney waits to be shipped to a more secure prison. Angela gets lost on her bike ride. It is after dark and cold. Seeking refuge, Angela wanders upon a campsite where two teen boys are camping. They stoke the fire and offer Angela a sleeping bag. The boys cannot sleep because they are excited sleeping with a girl. Gribney lights a newspaper on fire and throws it at the guard to start an escape attempt. Angela spends the night with the boys, while Paul has an erotic dream where he is in bed with both Angela and Linda.
Angela leaves the campsite early the next morning. She is found riding on the road by Paul Floret and some prison guards who tell Angela that her father is worried and has half the police force looking for her. They deliver Angela to her father who is relieved to see her and informs her that Gribney has escaped. At home, when Angela enters her bedroom, Gribney who has snuck in through the window, holds a scissors at Angela's throat. To remove the threat, Angela invites Gribney onto her bed. The night security patrol sees Gribney in the window. Four guards enter the house but Gribney escapes out the window. Angela sobs as her father enters. The security detail finds Gribney on the rooftop of the cell block. In his panic to avoid capture, Gribney falls to his death.
When Angela visits the crime scene, Forbus wants to know when Angela will see him again. She rejects his offer. Angela's father gets Angela a plane ticket and money to return to the states. She goes to visit Carl in the motor pool. They share a joint and start to make out until Forbus interrupts them. Forbus summons Angela's father to the garage. Forbus accuses Carl Maxwell of trying assault the warden's daughter, a story that Angela supports. However, Floret interrupts calling them both liars. Warden Thorne orders both Carl and Paul locked up. They react by taking Angela hostage and ordering the governor to allow the car through the prison gate without stopping. The car speeds recklessly through the prison grounds and out the gate. Forbus and Thorne follow in the prison van.
The escapees pull off the road and abandon the car. The van in pursuit stops. Forbus is left to scout through the woods while Thorne continues to cruise the roadways. Forbus discovers the car almost immediately. Angela, Carl and Paul are hiding nearby. Angela, given the opportunity to scream, does not. The three start to run, but Forbus sees them. The chase is now on foot. Carl, Angela and Paul roar out of a thicket having stolen a motorcycle from a couple who was using the privacy of the thicket to be intimate. Warden Thorne gives up the local search. The police are informed. Later, Thorne get a call the escapees were spotted and they had abandoned the motor cycle.
Through the night, Angela, Carl and Paul make their way to Hambourg where Paul's friend has a boat to cross the channel. They get to Peter's yacht who allows them on board. They discuss their destination but must wait until the evening tide to depart. Carl and Paul send Peter away. Paul decides to return to Greybourne not wanting to spend his life running. Angela and Carl remain on board and have sex. Carl brings Warden Thorne to the boat and he discovers the truth about his daughter. She explains in tears that it is easy to be wanted in bed and better than being not wanted at all."

Fairplay,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445963/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Teddy, a young greenhorn, arrives in Fairplay looking for his uncle F.O. McGill. He is surprised to find that far from owning a spa as he imagined, McGill runs a saloon frequented by outlaws. A western adventure set in Texas. Teddy, a young greenhorn, arrives in Fairplay looking for his uncle. He is surprised to find that far from owning a spa as he imagined, his uncle, McGill, runs a saloon frequented by outlaws. McGill is also engaged in a feud with the Purvis family which involves Teddy in an adventure that changes his life. Plenty of action in this very different western in which the only Indian, Running Eagle, is a half-breed: half Indian, half Hungarian, who insists on playing the violin. The story begins at the western town of Justin, at the tabernacle, where the preacher (Richard Webb) and Sister Lucindia (Helena Humann) are leading the congregation in singing hymns. The preacher then launches into a fire and brimstone sermon that causes some members to get all riled up and others to have trouble staying awake.Meanwhile, there are two cowboys approaching the church on horseback, taking turns drinking from a bottle of whiskey as they go. One of the cowboys is Gimp Murphy (Hugh Feagin). They dismount and approach the church, where two men are about to enter the front door. The two men are the ushers, tasked with passing the collection plates. Gimp and his partner disable and tie up the ushers and take their places, entering the church and awaiting the preacher's cue to start passing the plates.Ma Purvis (Sadie French) is so taken with the preacher's sermon, that she tells her husband Jova Purvis (Robert Middleton) to not only make a contribution from his little coin purse, but to add the ""mine money."" Jova reluctantly takes an envelope from his jacket pocket and drops it into the collection plate. As Gimp and his partner slip out the door with the money, the preacher sees them and calls the alarm. The congregation rushes out after them. The preacher grabs a rifle and shoots at the cowboys as they ride away on their horses. He hits Gimp's partner, mortally wounding him, but the man manages to stay on his horse. Someone calls out that the cowboys are headed for Fairplay.A dude from the east arrives at the Justin train station. His name is Teddy (Phillip Alford), and he's on his way to Fairplay to see his great uncle, F.O. McGill (Paul Ford). He tries to speak with a number of people nearby to inquire about getting a ride over to Fairplay, a distance of about 20 miles. No one is interested in talking to him, probably because he's an obvious tenderfoot, dressed in knickers and wearing glasses.The telegrapher (Frank Burkett) advises Teddy to speak with Skinner Bindleshaft (Paul Glaser) who's sitting atop a buckboard nearby. He guarantees Skinner will give Teddy a ride if he pays him. Teddy tells Bindleshaft that he has $5 and asks for a ride to Fairplay. Bindleshaft tells him it will cost $10 for him and $8 for his luggage. Teddy complains and tries to negotiate, but Bindleshaft holds firm, so Teddy agrees.F.O. McGill runs a ""health spa"" in Fairplay. It's a health spa in name only. It's actually a very run down building with a sign out front that says ""Fair Haven Hotel"" and it's doubtful that it does much, if any, legitimate business at all. The only people inside the building are sitting in the bar and include F.O., Utah Brazos (Terry Wilson), Dela Running Eagle (Norris Domingue), Raul (Paul Barloya), and Jefferson Washington (Bill McGhee). The four men are all supposed gun slingers hired by F.O. to help him rid the community of the Purvis family, enemies of F.O.Utah has his handgun rigged with a hair trigger, but it's always going off at inopportune times and just misses accidentally wounding or killing those nearby. Raul is a slightly built Mexican who drinks too much, Jefferson is thickset black man, and Running Eagle is a half Paiute Indian and half Hungarian who has a prized violin that he likes to play (but not very well).
F.O. remembers that this was the day his nephew, Teddy, was to arrive in Justin and he had intended to send one of the men over to pick him up at the train station. He starts ordering the men to take the wagon and go get Teddy, but they all have excuses as to why they can't or won't do it. F.O. finally has to hope that Teddy can find his own way to Fairplay.Two miles outside of Fairplay, Bindlestaff stops the wagon (he's got F.O.'s wagon) and tells Teddy to get out. Teddy thought he'd paid for a ride all the way to Fairplay, but Bindlestaff said it was just to the junction, and he'd have to pay another $3 for him to go on into Fairplay. Teddy refuses and gets out of the wagon and unloads his luggage.At the Fair Haven Hotel, another employee of F.O.'s is Captain Bob (Ethan Allen), an older man dressed like a sailor who sits in a makeshift eagle's nest on top of the hotel, keeping a lookout for any activity in the surrounding area. He has a telescope and a speaker tube at his disposal. The other end of the speaker tube is inside the bar and Bob communicates with F.O. using the device. As F.O. puts it, ""I have four 3rd rate gunslingers and one crazy sailor that I have to play ship with.""Gimp and his partner come across Teddy sitting at the crossroads. Teddy asks them for a ride to Fairplay. Gimp agrees to give him a ride for six bits and tells him he can ride behind his partner, who is draped across his horse. Teddy hides his luggage in some nearby shrubs and gets on the horse. They continue on and arrive at the hotel, where Gimp lifts his dead partner from his horse and F.O. directs him to take the body to the back room.Gimp attempts to sell his stolen goods to F.O., including the collection plates and some gold watches. F.O. tries to explain to Teddy that Gimp often brings in exotic items as part of their import-export business.F.O. sits Teddy down and tries to explain to him how rough the west is and how men have to be tough to survive.F.O. tries to get one of his men to go get his wagon back from Bindleshaft and then go fetch Teddy's luggage back at the junction, but they again all give reasons why they can't or won't. Finally, Running Eagle agrees to do it.Teddy asks Running Eagle to go kill and bring back a variety of animals, small to large, so he can mount them. He's a taxidermist and was sent out west by his father to expand their collection. Running Eagle agrees, once he learns that he'll be paid for the work, but he's not too excited about going onto the Purvis Ranch to do the collecting. Teddy had seen some distant hills he thought would be a good place for hunting and had told Running Eagle that.Jed Bartrum (Bill Thurman) is a would-be partner with Bindleshaft (Bindleshaft runs the Fairplay Mercantile). Jed's a rough-hewn sort, handy with his hands, and Bindleshaft has a plan that could make them both rich enough that they could move to Paris, France to live. That really appeals to Jed. Bindleshaft then explains that he wants Jed to build a non-working replica of a Gatling gun that he will then attempt to sell to F.O. and Jova Purvis, knowing each of them would not be able to resist such a weapon that had the potential to put up a wall of lead to mow down their enemies.F.O. tells Teddy a story about a boy named Johnny McGill (Mark Clyce), who was like a son to him. Seems Johnny was sparking Pearlie Purvis (Barbara Hancock), which Jova Purvis did not take kindly too. Johnny came riding back to Fairplay slumped over his horse and as he approached the hotel and F.O. he slid from the horse, uttered something about blueberry pie, and died. F.O. figures that Jova poisoned the boy by putting something in some blueberry pie.Teddy is over at the general store later, looking over the western clothes, when Pearlie comes into the store where she finds a dress and holds it in front of her as she dances around. Teddy watches and is immediately smitten with the girl. When she sees him, she likewise is attracted and wants him to come call for her at her house. Teddy starts to tell her who he is, then thinks better of it and he tells her that Bindleshaft is his uncle.Billy Joe Purvis (Charlie Dell) had come to town with Pearlie and Bindleshaft conned him into agreeing to accepting a case of marmalade jelly at a cost of $48 to take home. Billy Joe is not to swift and excitedly agrees. As he's out loading the marmalade into a wagon, Utah approaches and after insulting Billy Joe, calls him out to face him in a gunfight. Billy Joe doesn't understand the insult, so Bindleshaft has to take some time to explain it to him, then the fight is on. Both Billy Joe and Utah draw and fire, neither one of them coming anywhere close to their targets. Once they run out of ammo, they just go on their separate ways.Sheriff Oakes (Desmond Dhooge), comes looking for McGill and tells him he's looking for Gint Murphy, a suspect in the church robbery. They talk as they stand over the open coffin with the dead cowboy inside. Teddy comes into the room and F.O. tells the sheriff that it's Teddy's Uncle Buck who's dead in the coffin. After the sheriff leaves, Gint pushes up from underneath the dead cowboy and gets out of the coffin where he'd been hiding.When Jova sees the case of marmalade that Billy Joe brings home, and learns that Bindleshaft is charging them $48 for it, he becomes livid and orders his sons to join him as they head for Fairplay to confront Bindleshaft about it.Captain Bob sounds the alarm when he spots Bindleshaft and his sons approaching. He tells F.O. that they have what appears to be a box of dynamite with them. That gets everyone excited as they scramble to take up positions for an ambush. A big shootout ensues, but no one can hit anyone else, although F.O. and his men to a pretty good job at shooting up the marmalade box. A truce is finally called as Jova explains that he's there to see Bindleshaft, not engage in a battle with F.O. and his men.Bindleshaft is in his store, his face all spotted red and his head wrapped in a blanket, pretending to be sick. Jova demands that Bindleshaft take back the marmalade and take the charge off his account. Bindleshaft is able to make it appear as though Billy Joe willingly accepted the jelly, but even so, because the box and contents had been damaged in the shootout, there could be no refund.Teddy sees an opportunity for a new and very unusual addition to his taxidermy collection, so he takes the dead cowboy and prepares to figure out how to preserve him. Pearlie sees Teddy struggling with the body, first to put it in an outhouse (but Utah has to go and thinks it's just some passed out drunk who falls out when he opens the door), then on a table inside a building. She offers to help Teddy work on the body, but she falls asleep and wakes up just as Teddy is finishing making a mummy out of the body. Pearlie is upset that there will be trouble when her father realizes she'd been away all night.

Hooke and have the man install the firing pin. He'd have it back in two days.Bindleshaft next takes the gun over to F.O. and sells it to him for $5,000, this time explaining that he would have to go to Ft.

The Frenchman becomes their slave, and maritally lives with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). *Contains Spoilers* Later, he uses powder in the cannons that the Portuguese left behind to defeat the Tupiniquins in a battle. In order to celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat him.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 16th century Brazil rival French and Portuguese settlers are utilizing the indigenous people as allies in their struggle to establish control.

He tries to convince his captors by speaking in French (reciting the poem by Étienne Jodelle found in André Thévet's Singularities of France Antarctique) but the Tupinambás don't believe that the Frenchman was a prisoner of the Portuguese they have killed, and the Chief thinks he is Portuguese because ""No Frenchman would shoot at the Tupinambá.""

He also instructs him to collect wood, and pepper for him on his return.The relationship between the Frenchman and his Tupinambá ""wife"" remains enigmatic.

The Tupinambás then eat the Frenchman as celebration.In the last seconds of his life, the Frenchman refuses to play along with the ceremonial script that the Tupinambás expect him to follow and instead angrily (and loudly) tells the Tupinambás that his death will not revitalize them (as his death and the subsequent cannibal feast is intended to do) but rather will doom them all to extermination.The movie ends with a postscript that reveals the rival Tupiniquim were later exterminated by their supposed allies, the Portuguese."

The Salamander,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067701/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Pierre and Paul, journalist and writer respectively, team up to write a screenplay based on the real story of a young woman accused by her uncle of trying to kill him. They decide to meet her. Two men, arty though somewhat staid, are drawn to the spirited and quixotic Rosemonde, a young working-class woman whom they meet because they're writing a teleplay about a minor but curious event in which either her uncle was wounded while cleaning his rifle or she shot him. Pierre is a free-lance journalist hired to write the script; he's short of time so he asks a Bohemian novelist friend, Paul, to help. Pierre wants facts and tracks down Rosemonde for interviews that lead to other explorations; Paul only wants to imagine her and needs little more than her name to do so. But he does meet her, and she entangles him, too. Did she cause the shooting? Is she venomous or innocent?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Pierre is a journalist working on a series of articles relating Brazilian economics to those in Switzerland. His friend, Paul, is a novelist who works as a house painter to make ends meet. When the financially strapped Pierre pursues a paying assignment from Swiss television to write a script about a shooting incident several years back, he enlists Paul's help to complete everything in the needed one-month time frame. The incident offers some intrigue: a man is shot while cleaning his army rifle. He says his delinquent niece, Rosemonde, shot him, while she claims he accidentally shot himself. The truth is never determined and Rosemonde is not charged.
Pierre pursues the assignment like a journalist, reviewing the shooting scene and interviewing the uncle, the niece's former employers and friends, and eventually Rosemonde herself. Paul recreates the incident, applying his imagination alone to construct the details of the plot and the players while continuing at home with his poet wife and young daughter. They plan to work independently and pool their material to create the final script. Uncannily, Paul intuits a lot of the details of events and persons correctly without knowing the facts, while we observe Pierre running the facts down. He develops a relationship with Rosemonde, who enters his life and his bed. Paul meets Rosemonde at Pierre's and also falls under her spell. He concocts a tale in which he appears to tell his wife he has been unfaithful and she responds by quoting a passage from Handke that speaks to a future where people will be free to live and love as they like without hurting each other.
Meeting the actual Rosemonde destroys Paul's ability to work on her story, while Pierre has only his notes to fall back on. The deadline passes, they cannot deliver the script, and they have already spent the fee, defraying old debts and helping Rosemonde. Officialdom imposes as an inspector arrives to evaluate the contents of Pierre's apartment since the rent has not been paid for months. Pierre faces poverty and eviction and decides to relocate to Paris while Paul returns to house painting, but their friendship continues strong. We watch Rosemonde defy her petit bourgeois bosses, first leaving her sausage factory job and subsequently getting herself fired from a shoe shop after she is implicated in a burglary there. She walks away smiling into the Christmas shopping crowds. At least for these few minutes, she is free."

Blood Thirst,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066847/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A sex-crimes specialist from New York travels to the Philippines to help his friend, a Manila homicide detective, solve a series of murders. Adam Rourke [Robert Winston], a wise-cracking sex-crime specialist from New York, who
talks to himself and carries an old, lifesize dummy named Harvey in his
suitcase, is called to Manila by old friend and chief inspector of
homicide, Captain Miguel Ramos [Vic Diaz]. Girls have been turning up dead, found
hanging upside down from trees with their wrists cut and their bodies
drained of blood. The only lead is that the latest victim (Maria Cortez)
was working at the Barrio Club. Adam suggests that a good way to approach
the investigation would be for him to go undercover, posing as an American
writer. Miguel agrees, but only on the condition that he and Adam have no
contact with each other while Adam is undercover. Miguel's London-educated
sister Sylvia [Katherine Henryk], however, takes an instant dislike to Adam's cavalier
attitude, particularly his poohpoohing the ""unsophisticated"" rumors that the
killings might have something to do with voodoo or vampirism.The next night, Adam visits the Barrio, asking to see the club's
owner, Mr Calderon [Vic Silayan]. He doesn't get very far with his cover about wanting
to write a story about Maria's murder. Calderon agrees only to think about
it. While discussing his article with Calderon, Adam's attention is drawn
to the bellydancer Serena Brioso [Yvonne Nielson]. Later that night, as Adam prepares to sleep, he is attacked
by a man with a machete. Hehehe. The man didn't know it, but the machete
just killed Harvey the dummy. Adam was standing in the shadows with his
loaded gun and killed the killer. A bit later, Adam goes for a walk and is
confronted by a one-legged beggar named Herrera [Eddie Infante] who turns out to be
Miguel's contact (and also the guy who took care of the machete-wielder's
body). Herrera will be watching Adam and will never be too far away, he
says. On his way back into the hotel, Adam sees Sylvia drive up. She tells
him to get into her car and drives him several miles outside of the city,
where she kisses him, then slaps his face and drives off, leaving Adam to
walk back to his hotel. [This is payback for Adam stealing a kiss the
night before.] On his walk back, Adam notices Theresa, a girl from the
Barrio Club, being dropped off.The next morning, Theresa turns up dead. [Clue: Both Teresa and Maria
were attacked by the same person, whose face looks like an advanced case
of neurofibromatosis.] That evening, Adam returns to the Barrio Club to
get an answer from Calderon regarding the article he wants to write. While
they chat, Serena does her bellydance again. In the middle of the dance,
however, she stumbles, feels her face, and runs out. [Clue: Serena is
using the blood of the murdered girls to sustain her beauty.] Adam
attempts to follow Serena but the club's bouncers toss him out.The next time Adam goes to the Barrio Club, Serena takes him aside
and asks him to meet her at the club the following evening when Calderon
is planning to be away on business. Calderon is charming, Serena warns,
but he can be strange and violent. While walking back to his hotel, Adam
meets up with Herrera who informs him that another waitress (Elena Munoz)
from the Barrio Club has disappeared. Adam informs Herrera about his
planned meeting with Serena and tells him to relay the message to Miguel
that he should be ready to move when he gets a telephone call. When Adam
returns to his hotel room, he is immediately aware that he's not alone. In
the dark, he tackles the intruder. It turns out to be Sylvia bringing news
from Miguel, who has been checking on Calderon's background. It seems that
Calderon and Serena fled to Manila from Peru where Calderon was involved
in the murder of a wealthy plantation owner. Calderon and Serena have been
together for about three years. Now aware that she's in love with Adam,
Sylvia boldly solicits a kiss.The next evening, Adam meets Serena as planned. She tells him that
Calderon is a maniac and is planning to kill both her and Adam. She asks
Adam to meet her later that night, one hour after the club closes. In the
meantime, she orders him a drink, which is served to him by none other
than their newest waitress -- Sylvia. I wanted to help, Sylvia explains to
Adam. Adam berates her for getting involved, not knowing that Serena is
listening to their conversation. Sylvia calls Adam's attention to the
armbands that Serena always wears. I saw them once in a London museum,
Sylvia says. They're Aztec or Incan and very expensive.Cut to Elena Munoz. She is currently tied to a table down in a cellar
somewhere, and neurofibroma man is wielding a knife. He slits Elena's arms
and collects the blood in a big cauldron. The cauldron then rotates in a
circle, stopping at a chair where Serena is seated. Her face has turned
haggard. She opens a locket, takes out a pinch of magical herbs, and
tosses it in the blood. Immediately, a lot of fog covers her. When it
clears, her face is young again.An hour after the Barrio Club closes, Adam shows up as planned.
Serena picks him up and drives him to her house. Adam pours himself a
drink, but the liquor is drugged and he passes out, but not before Serena
spins a tale of how Calderon killed his wife, killed Maria and Theresa,
and threatened to kill her, too, should she ever leave him. When Adam
comes to, Serena haughtily explains that she is a Golden Goddess, chosen by
her people to be immortal, existing on the blood of young women. As she
raises a knife to kill Adam, Elena Munoz's father steps out from behind
the tree. Serena runs, and Munoz cuts Adam free. Unfortunately, as Adam
and Munoz make their getaway, Serena runs down Munoz and kills him. Adam
is forced to make his way back to the club on foot, but not before he
stops at a roadside stand and telephones Miguel.Meanwhile, Sylvia was snooping around the club. She made her way down
into the cellar where she was seen and caught by neurofibroma man. As he
now prepares to slit her arms and collect her blood, Adam and Miguel break
open the door. They shoot neurofibroma man, but he keeps coming. He tries

It was Dev Saab all the way.
Released three months after JMN, the movie Gambler completes 50 years of its release this week. It did a reasonably good business but it was nowhere compared to JMN.
Dev Saab carried this movie entirely on his shoulders. His charm, energy , and style made the movie a success. Credit should also be given to Neeraj's pen and Sachinda's tunes which are hummed even today.
The weak point of the movie is its story. While JMN was first of its kind based on a new formula and very stylish characters, Gambler was based on a twenty-year-old formula of a rich and influential man dumping a sidha- sadha woman after making her pregnant. The doomed from birth child is left to fend for himself or brought by villains. In this case, Jeevan turns the hero( Dev Anand) into a gambler who plays in his club to dupe the unsuspecting players. The hero's love for an idealistic woman ( Zahida) is the motivation for him to leave Jeevan, and he makes a place for himself in the society by backing the right horses and ponies.
Zahida is very beautiful and she has inherited the family charm in abundance. If Nargis was ten out of ten, her niece Zahida could be rated as seven or eight. But in the acting department, if Nargis was ten out of ten, Zahida could score only about three. In Gambler, her performance can be downgraded to two. She plays a social worker( the khadi exhibition type), detests the hero right from the beginning, tolerates him for a while in romantic songs, and dumps the hero at the slightest pretext as if she was determined by the destiny to do that. Her aunt Nargis had given a wonderful performance in a similar situation in Awara where the heroine was an adopted daughter of a judge, and a lawyer herself, in love with a criminal. We see nothing of that kind from Zahida in Gambler.
The movie has another heroine, Zaheera, who looked very beautiful. All I can say for Zaheera is that she could have become another Saira Bano if she had got the right mentors and worked on her Hindi.
Rashid Khan plays a compulsive gambler who always loses. Because of his poverty, his son Sachin is forced to work for the villain and ends up stabbing a policeman.The way Sachin is killed is totally unrealistic. He is in a juvenile home , where we also see an adult criminal who carries a pistol waiting for an opportunity to kill Sachin.For the reasons best known to them, the writer and director eliminate almost entire khandaan of Rashid Khan who commits suicide, wife dies of tuberculosis, and the son is killed by a criminal in a juvenile home. The only one left is his daughter Zaheera who gives moral support to the hero during his rough times.We also see Shatrughan Sinha as the rival gambler whose role in the movie grew in its importance to keep up with his growing popularity. Iftekhar is there too., but there isn't much for him to do except that he knows about the hero's murky past. For a change, Manorama got a positive role as Zahida's never failing, good hearted aunt.
We can see this movie again and again because Dev Saab is not only at his charming best, he has also given a superb performance through out the film. There are excellent songs, particularly the romantic ones. Many viewers were of the view that if there was Hema Malini with Dev Saab in the songs like Churi Nahi Mera Dil Hai, and Apne Hothon Ki Banshi, the movie could have become the top grosser of the year.

A director with a very distinctive style, Jovan Jovanovic has filmed in 1971 one of the most significant works in the history of contemporary Serbian film. ""Young and Healthy Like a Rose"" is a strong visionary achievement that still looks topical today as back in the times when it was filmed and banned by the then communist censorship. A story about a young delinquent, who evolves from typical outsider to mafia boss of Belgrade seemed shocking back then; today, it is the cruel reality of our times. With incredible foresight of things to come, Jovanovic's leading character says: ""I am your future"". More poetical than Hollywood movies, much more realistic than ""Trainspotting"". An exciting story about crime, drugs and the deadly grip of the secret police in Serbia.

They wander outside among the couples who are kissing and smoking marijuana, but Mindy continues to rebuff Bill's physical advances. She returns to the dance, where young teacher Jack Thompson (Steven Stewart), an amateur photographer who is shooting the dance for the school paper, takes her picture. Horrified because she has not combed her hair, Mindy asks for the photo's negative so she can destroy it, and Jack agrees to give it to her later. Soon after, Jack's wife Gretchen (Jennifer Ritt), the school gym teacher, complains about the music and stalks out in anger when Jack does not want to leave early. Later, a pair of students fall into the pool while fighting, inspiring the rest of the students to jump into the water gleefully. At home, Gretchen refuses to drink with Jack, then rebuffs him sexually.The next morning, while Mindy's best friend Sandy (Marley Holiday) surreptitiously plans a surprise birthday party for her for that evening, Mindy visits Jack to retrieve the photograph. Spotting naked snapshots of Gretchen, Mindy encourages Jack to practice photography professionally and suggests herself as a model.

Meanwhile, as Bill and his best friend Les (Bruno Kirby), who is Sandy's boyfriend, work on their dragster cars, Les reveals that Mindy has told Sandy that she has a crush on Jack. Mindy has grown disillusioned with middle-class trappings, and at a sleepover with Sandy, complains that having money and a good job are pointless, citing Sandy's alcoholic father as an example.

The Year of the Yahoo!,1971,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069521/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A country-western singer is recruited to run for the U.S. Senate, and soon clashes with his unscrupulous campaign manager on the tactics to run his political campaign. Hank Jackson is a clean-cut Country & Western singer whom is recruited to run for the post of Republican senator of Texas with the assistance of three Washington D.C. 'technical advisers'; cynical movie producer Sid Angelo, image consultant Chet Stoner, and political advisor Ed Varnett whom are under the employment of the shady Governor Baxter whom wants his latest political rival, Senator Birdwell, out of the way. During the cleverly scripted campaign of TV commercials and political speeches, Hank lets the thoughts of fame and popularity go to his head. But it puts a strain on his relationship with his liberal girlfriend Tammy Parker whom is currently leading a strike that Hank opposes. Seeing Tammy as a threat to Hank's campaign, the ruthless Sid Angelo plots to shut her up by unethical and illegal means.—matt-282 When Senator Fred Burwell (Robert Swain), a Democrat who has served his nameless Southwestern state in the U.S. Senate for the last 18 years, seeks re-election on a liberal platform opposing the president, the corrupt ""old-boy"" political network, headed by Republican Governor Baxter (Jeffrey Allen) and his crony, Art Farnsworth (Tom Lytel), springs into action. Farnsworth arranges for the president's office in Washington DC to help defeat Burwell, and the President tells him over the phone that he will personally send ""technical advisers"" from Washington to the state to help out. Soon after, a three-man delegation led by Chet Stoner (Robert Jolly), who is known as an ""official cabinet member,"" arrives at Baxter's office. Stoner is accompanied by Sid Angelo (Ray Sager), a slick, cynical television producer, and advertising executive Ed Varnett (Terrel Cass). The three supercilious city men regard the governor and Farnsworth as ""hicks,"" and so overrule the governor's choice for the candidate. Instead, they insist on promoting country singer Hank Jackson (Claude King), a man who sings the promise of ""God and Country"", which is just the thing for the voters the three regard as ""yahoos.""After Hank, who feels he has a patriotic duty to his country, accepts the nomination, Sid decides that he should announce his candidacy on Hank's weekly television show. The dictatorial Sid stages every detail of Hanks announcement, from his completely scripted speech to the way the audience greets the news. When Sid condescends to Hank's audience and treats them like fools, Hanks fiancee, Tammy Parker (Ronna Riddle), who likes Burwell's policies, objects. Varnett then outlines an ad strategy for the campaign, dismissing a discussion of issues to concentrate on marketing Hank as a candidate ""wrapped in the flag.""When Tammy and Baxter question their strategy, Sid derides Hank as just a ""grinning country cowboy singer"" and arrogantly dismisses their concerns. Although Hank writes all his own songs, Sid and the others provide him with a pre-written campaign ditty disparaging welfare cheats and preaching intolerance toward all minorities. Sid titles Hank's campaign with the single-word slogan ""Hope"". A very unlikable type, Sid continues to throw staged and rigged TV appearances for Hank as well as seducing Carol (Leslie Slater) a script girl and secretary for one night, only to discard her the morning after.As Burwell pleads for reason and understanding, his ratings begin to fall. A rent strike crystallizes the difference between the two candidates, with Burwell supporting the right of the strikers to withhold their rent in the face of intolerable living conditions, while Hank advocates throwing the bums out if they don't pay.Becoming more and more disillusioned with Hank's decision to jettison his own liberal beliefs for those of his craven campaign managers, Tammy refuses to appear on his weekly show and finally walks out on him. Later, when Hank complains to his handlers that he is sick of ""playing up to rednecks,"" Sid cruelly brays that Hank will do whatever he tells him to do.When Hank actually begins to beat Burwell in the polls, Sid decides to hold a purportedly spontaneous question and answer session on television, which unknown to the viewing audience, will be totally scripted. When one of the panelists ignores his cue card and asks Hank a candid question about the substandard housing conditions of the rental apartments, Hank is flummoxed.Tammy decides to join the strikers on the picket line and one night, after leaving the picketers, is brutally raped in an alley by two men opposing the strikers. Tammy is taken to the hospital, and before Hank goes to visit her, Sid pulls him aside and, blaming the strikers for the rape, urges Sid to capitalize on the issue. However, when Tammy tells Hank that his own supporters raped her and were hired at Sid's behest, Hank, disgusted by Sid's machiavellianism, fires him and decides to finish the campaign his own way.But as Sid predicts exactly, Hank running the campaign all by himself is a failure. Although Hank begins to speak his mind and gets back together with Tammy, he finds that he is unable to answer complex questions and his supporters, perplexed by his sudden turnabout, lose interest in his campaign. Most of Hank's supporters see him as a honest, but boring candidate.Election Day comes and goes. Hank loses the election and Burwell is re-elected senator. The next morning, despite being badly beaten, Hank and Tammy celebrate now that Hank's ordeal is over. Meanwhile, as the cynical and unscrupulous campaign committee packs to return to Washington, Sid informs Chet and Varnett that he has been hired for a new job... that of defeating the president in the elections the following year. Evil and cynical to the end, Sid claims that the Hank Jackson campaign is just another episode of his career and doesn't care about any one by explaining ""a job's a job"".In the final scene, the nameless and unseen President phones Baxter to offer condolences for the loss of the campaign. With Art Farnsworth looking on, Baxter (who never really supported Hank in the first place) comments that the people have taken their stand in which commercialization is the key to win campaigns. When the President offers to provide Baxter with technical advisers of his own for Baxter's re-election campaign the following year alongside the President's own re-election campaign, the governor chuckles in contempt and tells the President that he will think about it."

The stage is the Republic of Vietnam, and the scenes portray a time during the Vietnam War as experienced by the Southern Vietnamese people, themselves. Phi, a soldier, longing to take Lien off to their private, imaginary space (the Purple Horizon), understands what his duty and commitment as a soldier is. Lien is a singer whose style is reminiscent of the ""Torch"" singers of the early 1930s. She desperately longs to escape the world with Phi to their purple horizon. Without Phi, she is not just alone but lost to the point of feeling genuinely dead. Phi understands this, but he is first, a soldier. There are some stark realities that both must deal with, but they deal with their realities in very different ways. Phi, the soldier, has many conflicts; but also, feelings and love for Lien, his family, and friends. Lien, without Phi, doesn't live, but merely exists."

At that moment, the rebel leader Mohamed Abdel Krim, who speaks a few European languages, notices the incident.

When the authorities prove to be no help, he cuts a violent swath across the countryside in search of his missing missus. After escaping enemy imprisonment, hardened Vietnam War veteran Ross Archer returns home blinded in one eye from an injury suffered during frontline combat. Arriving at his houseboat, Ross, sporting an eye patch, is surprised to find go-go dancer Ellie living there instead of his wife Angela. Ellie explains that Angela, who worked with her at Maxie Marks's night club, offered to let Ellie live on the boat after having moved out months earlier. Later, Ross learns from club owner and comedian Maxie that Angela quit to look for better work after Ross was reported missing in action. Discovering Angela's current address from pinup photographer Carmen, Ross lets himself into her extravagant suite at the Ambassador Hotel and finds articles about millionaire Gregory Mann. When an affluently dressed Angela returns carrying wig boxes, she shows Ross no affection and will not explain her current circumstances to him, despite a violent outburst from Ross. Returning to the houseboat, Ross is forced to fight off an intruder, who escapes. When Ellie returns to the houseboat that evening, she coyly admits that she read his letters to Angela and is intrigued by him, prompting Ross to kiss her. The next morning, police lieutenant Craig informs Ross that Angela jumped to her death at the hotel, leaving only a suicide note, which Ross confirms is in her handwriting. Suspicious about the death, Ross insists on an autopsy and tells Craig about the prowler and the articles on Mann. Although reluctant to spend time on a suicide, Craig agrees to accompany Ross to the Mann estate, where they are greeted by the vacuous, etiquette-obsessed Mrs. Mann and the gentlemanly, wheelchair-bound Mann, who claims to know nothing about Angela. Locating the shop where Angela purchased her wigs, Ross learns that she bought a brunette wig and made a call from the shop to plan a rendezvous at room 25 in the La Paloma hotel. When Ross arrives at the address, he finds Dr. Barry, an abortionist, who admits under pressure that an anonymous woman sought his services, but died during the late-term abortion. When the spineless man attempts to return the $600 fee to Ross to assuage his anger, Ross attacks him, sending the man fleeing into the street where he is killed by a passing car. Later, Craig reveals that the autopsy report showed Angela was dead before she was thrown from the roof. Although Craig assumes that she died from the abortion, Ross is still uncertain and goes to the club to confront Maxie, whom he has learned was having an affair with Angela. While at the club, Ross receives a call from Carmen, but before he can get to her studio, knife-wielding Christopher, Mann's hired thug, kills Carmen for information about a ""Judith Hagen."" Minutes later, Ross discovers Carmen's body and the very much alive Angela, disguised in a brunette wig. His wife explains that a woman resembling her, the South American Judith, was blackmailing Mann with information that is now in a safe-deposit box, for which Angela has the key. Carmen had taken Judith for the abortion, but when she died, paid Angela $25,000 of the blackmail money to pose as Judith and make the suicide look as if Angela had died. After stating that Carmen's murderer was looking for the key, Angela reminisces fondly with Ross about their reckless youth and early marriage, and they consider reuniting. The next day, while Angela, posing as Judith, enters the bank to retrieve the contents of the safe-deposit box, Ross spots the suspicious-looking Christopher waiting outside. After they discover that the package contains proof that Mann was actually war criminal Wilhelm Hauser, a major in the Third Reich, Ross insists that Angela return to her apartment to protect her from Christopher, while he takes the package, thus luring the thug to follow him rather than Angela. After a high speed chase, Ross drives off the road, stops his car and engages Christopher in a fistfight. Christopher prevails, grabs the package and attempts to run over him, but Ross shoots him, causing the car and the evidence to explode in flames. Ross then goes to Mann's house, where he insinuates that he now is in possession of the proof about Mann's war crimes. Mann divulges that after serving in the Third Reich military, he fled to Paraguay where he had a daughter, Judith, whom he abandoned. He had ignored her recent attempts to contact him, willing to do anything rather than face trial for his war crimes. Mann offers Ross $100,000 to keep quiet and orders his wife to get the money from the safe. Appalled to learn of her husband's real identity, Mrs. Mann gets the money, but adds an extra pill to his regular medications, causing instant heart failure. After Mrs. Mann unabashedly admits to her deed, Ross watches Mann's excruciating death. Leaving with the money, Ross hopes to reunite with Angela at the Ambassador, and goes to the hotel, but discovers that she has fallen to her death from the apartment window. He then goes to the club, where a drunken Maxie, who is rehearsing a comedy routine, admits to pushing Angela out the window in a rage after finding that she was still alive. Ross chases Maxie onto the beach, where he almost drowns him, but stops after recalling drowning a Viet Cong girl during the war. At Ross's boat later, Craig informs him that Mrs. Mann, soon to inherit millions, deliriously repeated the amount ""$100,000"" to police as she was taken away to a mental facility. Craig then hints that Ross is ""due for some,"" and leaves him in peace. When Ellie asks about his plans, Ross tells her, ""fishing,"" and leaves alone for the deep sea."
