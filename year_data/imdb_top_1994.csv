Having a great plot, funny and captivating characters and the most celebrated soundtrack in a kid's film, only compared to the likes of Frozen.

Acquiring the advice from his old counselors (Zazu and Rafiki), the help from his new friends, Timone and Pumbaa, and the unexpected warning of a familiar face, whilst discovering the paths of love through his childhood girlfriend Nala, Simba will unshackle the Savanna from the reign of terror of Scar and returning the natural order to the Circle of Life.—Anonymous The Lion King takes place in the Pride Lands of Africa, where a lion rules over the other animals as king. As dawn breaks, all the animals of the Pride Lands are summoned to Pride Rock, the home of the pride of lions. Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), a mandrill, walks through the herd and climbs the face of Pride Rock to greet his friend, King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). Mufasa leads Rafiki to his mate Sarabi (Madge Sinclair) who is holding their newborn cub. Rafiki anoints the cub with fruit juices before presenting him to the gathered animals. The animals cheer and then bow to the new future king.Meanwhile, Scar (Jeremy Irons), the younger brother of Mufasa, is sulking by himself behind Pride Rock. He is envious of his brother's position as king and is disgruntled at the fact that he will never be king now that Mufasa has an heir. Mufasa and his majordomo, a hornbill named Zazu (Rowan Atkinson), confront Scar on why he wasn't present at the ceremony that morning. Scar shrugs it off, claiming he had forgotten, and scoffs his new responsibility to show respect to the future king before wandering off.As monsoon storms drench the Pride Lands, Rafiki is seen in his tree home, a large baobab, adding details to his newest piece of wall art. He chuckles lightly as he finishes, reciting the new cub's name, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas).Now a budding youth, Simba rises early one morning and pesters his father to get up and show him the lands he's destined to rule over. Mufasa illustrates from the top of Pride Rock that everything the light touches is their kingdom, except for a place on the horizon that is covered in shadow. Mufasa tells Simba he's forbidden from ever going there. Out in the plains, Mufasa tells Simba that there is a balance to all life which eventually comes full circle; the Circle of Life. When Zazu appears with a morning report, Mufasa takes the opportunity to give Simba a pouncing lesson which goes successfully, much to Zazu's dismay. As Simba gets ready to try again, Zazu suddenly exclaims that a group of hyenas has been seen in the Pride Lands. Mufasa rushes off to deal with it while Zazu takes Simba home.Simba returns to Pride Rock where his Uncle Scar is lurking about. Simba brags about his fate to be king to which Scar reacts without the slightest bit of enthusiasm. Casually, and goading Simba's excitement, Scar asks if Mufasa showed him the shadow place on their morning walk. When Simba replies no, Scar adds that it is a dangerous place where only the bravest lions venture. Simba perks up, saying he's brave, and begs his uncle to tell him what's there. Scar feigns an accidental slip of the tongue by revealing that it's an elephant graveyard but praises Simba's cleverness. He asks that Simba never explore the place, but as Simba reassures him and leaves, Scar smiles to himself knowing full well that Simba's curiosity will get the better of him.Simba meets up with his friend Nala (Niketa Calame-Harris) who is being bathed by her mother, SarafinaZoe Leader. He tells her about a cool place he has found, lying to Sarabi that its around the water hole. Sarabi gives them permission to go as long as Zazu accompanies them. Along the way, Simba and Nala devise a plan together to get rid of Zazu, which works. They then run off, Nala showing off her skills as an expert pinner, before finding themselves in the elephant graveyard. Suddenly, Zazu reappears and demands that they leave. Simba shows off his bravery by laughing in front of a large skull. Laughter echoes from within and three hyenas emerge, surrounding the cubs. Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), Banzai (Cheech Marin), and Ed (Jim Cummings) deliberate what's to be done with the cubs, more specifically, how to eat them. The cubs and Zazu escape for a moment, but Zazu is pulled back and stuffed into a boiler which shoots him into the air. The hyenas eventually corner the cubs in an alcove and Simba tries to roar. The hyenas laugh and tell him to try again. A real roar is let out as Mufasa appears and attacks the hyenas before they run off. Zazu reappears by Mufasa's side and Simba tries to say something but Mufasa furiously reprimands him for being deliberately disobedient and leads them towards home.Back in the Pride Lands, Mufasa tells Zazu to take Nala home while he teaches Simba a lesson. Fearful and meek, Simba walks up to his father, noticing that his father's paw print is much bigger than his own. He apologizes for disobeying but says he only wanted to be brave like Mufasa. Mufasa tells Simba he's only brave when he has to be. As they reconcile, Mufasa tells Simba that all the stars in the night sky are the spirits of kings past and that they will always be there to guide him, as will he.Back in the graveyard, the hyenas lick their wounds and quarrel with each other. Their fights are broken up by Scar who is greeted as a friend. Irritated that the hyenas couldn't dispose of the cubs, he proposes a plan that would eliminate both Simba and Mufasa from the throne.The next day, Scar escorts Simba through a gorge and puts him near a rock shaded by a sapling, telling him that Mufasa is planning a surprise for him. Scar instructs Simba to stay put while he fetches Mufasa and suggests that he practice his roar while he's away. Just above the gorge, the three hyenas lie in wait in front of a massive herd of wildebeest. Scar appears above them, signaling them. As Simba waits, scowling over his little roar, a chameleon climbs down from the tree. Simba practices roaring at it, finally letting off one loud enough to scare the chameleon and echo off all sides of the gorge. But the ground starts shaking and Simba looks up to see the herd of wildebeest charging down the gorge straight for him. He runs away, the wildebeest gaining, while Scar warns Mufasa nearby that there is a stampede in the gorge and Simba is down there. Simba manages to grab hold of a broken tree, elevating himself above the wildebeests' horns while Mufasa climbs down and runs alongside the animals. He manages to grab Simba in his mouth and carries him to safety, but is pulled back by the charging animals. After a tense moment, Simba watches his father leap onto the side of the gorge, digging his claws into the dirt and struggling up the hillside. As Mufasa nears the top, he sees Scar standing over him. He pleads for help, but Scar digs his claws into his paws and mocks him before pushing him off. Simba watches helplessly as Mufasa falls onto the stampeding herd.As the dust settles, Simba runs down to look for his father. He discovers him beneath a broken tree, dead. As he mourns his loss, Scar appears and blames Simba for what happened. Simba, thinking he had started the stampede that killed his father, follows his uncles advice when Scar tells him to run away and never return. Simba runs off as Scar instructs his hyenas to kill him. The three hyenas chase Simba to the edge of an incline where he tumbles into a sea of brambles. Small enough to avoid the sharp spikes, Simba runs through them as the hyenas barely manage to stop near the base. Unlucky Banzai is shoved into the brambles and emerges howling, stuck with thorns. The hyenas watch as Simba runs into the distant desert and decide that he will most likely die, shouting to him that if he ever comes back they will kill him.Scar returns to Pride Rock to announce that both Simba and Mufasa have perished in the stampede and assumes the role as king. The lionesses look on in fear as a horde of hyenas arrives to live alongside Scar at Pride Rock. Rafiki watches sullenly from a distance and smears the image he had once created of Simba.In the desert, Simba has collapsed under the heat and a group of vultures descends on him. Suddenly, a meerkat and a warthog charge into them, bucking and kicking them away as part of their favorite game; bowling for buzzards. The warthog, Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), then discovers Simba and brings him to the attention of his meerkat companion, Timon (Nathan Lane). Timon is initially afraid of the young lion but Pumbaa asserts that he's still little and will grow up to be on their side instead of eating them. Timon scoffs at the idea, before suggesting the very same thing as his own. Pumbaa picks Simba up and carries him into the shade where he's revived. Simba thanks them for their help before walking away. Timon and Pumbaa take pity on him and tell him that, whatever happened to him, he has to put his past behind him, citing their motto Hakuna Matata; no worries. They then invite Simba to stay with them as a fellow outcast in their jungle paradise and teach him to eat bugs rather than meat. Simba begins to cheer up and eventually grows into a healthy, carefree adult (Matthew Broderick).Meanwhile, the Pride Lands have been reduced to a wasteland under Scars rule. Zazu is confined to a bone cage singing while Scar lazily lies about chewing on bones. Zazu mutters under his breath that he never had to do this under Mufasa. Scar reels on the name, citing that the law is to never mention Mufasas name. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed appear, complaining that food and water have become scarce and that the lionesses refuse to hunt. Scar suggests they eat Zazu as Banzai lets slip Mufasas name before he corrects himself under Scars glare. Scar then dismisses them.Back in the jungle, Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa lie down together after a meal of bugs to look up at the night sky. Pumbaa asks what the sparkling lights in the sky are to which Timon replies that they're fireflies that got stuck in the big, bluish-black thing. Pumbaa says he'd always thought they were burning balls of gas billions of miles away, a theory which Timon debunks due to Pumbaa's flatulent nature. They ask Simba what he thinks. Answering only to their begging, he says he was once told that the lights are great kings of the past watching over them. Timon starts cracking up over the thought of royal dead guys watching them, but Simba wanders off, saddened over the memory of his father. He sighs and collapses onto a bunch of wild flowers, spreading their petals and leaves to the wind. The wind carries them back to the Pride Lands where Rafiki, sitting atop his tree, grabs them. He takes them back into the tree where he sniffs them and contemplates the apparent familiar smell. Suddenly it strikes him; Simba must be alive. Crazed with happiness, he quickly smears a mane around the head of his Simba drawing, stating that it is time.Timon and Pumbaa are walking through the jungle together when Pumbaa becomes distracted by a large rhino beetle. Hungry, he follows it to the edge of the jungle and sneaks up on it as its perched on a log facing some grassland. His eye then catches something in the tall grass as the beetle flies away. Pumbaa screams as a lioness emerges from the grasses and gives chase. Hearing Pumbaa, Timon comes running and finds him stuck in the roots of a tree. He tries to free Pumbaa as the lioness draws closer. She leaps forward but Simba jumps in and begins to fight with her while Timon cheers him on. He tries to knock her down but she flips him over and pins him to the ground. Simba recognizes this move and his old friend, Nala (Moira Kelly). When he reveals himself, Nala is shocked and happy to see him again. Simba introduces her to Pumbaa and Timon, who is less than happy about the reunion since Nala had tried to eat Pumbaa. Nala tells Simba that everyone in the Pride Lands thought he was dead after Scar told them about the stampede. Nervous, Simba asks what else Scar told them, but Nala says that it doesn't matter now that he's alive and the rightful king. Simba excuses Timon and Pumbaa to speak to Nala alone. As they walk through the jungle together the romantic settings encourage their feelings for each other, though Simba is hesitant to talk to Nala about his past. She tries to get Simba to go back to the Pride Lands with her, telling him that everything has fallen into disarray since Scar took the throne. He refuses, explaining that he shouldn't worry about things that happened in the past, which angers Nala. She tells Simba that returning to the throne is his responsibility but he storms off and walks out of the jungle to an open field. He tries to justify his decision before yelling at the night sky that Mufasa wasn't there for him and feeling solemn that it was his fault.He then hears singing coming from a tree behind him and sees Rafiki in the branches. Irritated, he walks away. Rafiki follows him and asks him a series of rhetorical questions and chanting seemingly nonsensical words. Convinced that the baboon is crazy and confused, Simba turns to walk away when Rafiki reveals that he knows Simba is Mufasas son. Rafiki then runs off and Simba follows. He finds Rafiki mediating on a rock and asks if he knew his father. Rafiki says ""I know your father"", to which Simba responds that he died. Rafiki laughs, saying that Mufasa is alive, and leads Simba through a thicket of trees and vines. They stop at a reflecting pool and Rafiki instructs Simba to look into it. Seeing only his reflection at first, Simba looks harder and sees an image of Mufasa. Rafiki says that Mufasa lives within him as a large storm cloud appears overhead and a specter of Mufasa speaks out to Simba, saying that he has forgotten who he is and that he must take his rightful place as the true king of Pride Rock. Simba begs his father to stay but the apparition disappears, echoing that Simba must remember who he is. As Simba contemplates the message and the change in the winds, Rafiki wallops him over the head with his staff. Outraged and in pain, Simba asks what he did that for. Rafiki says that it doesn't matter because its in the past, but though the past may still hurt, one can either run from it or learn from it. He swings his staff again and Simba ducks before grabbing the staff and throwing it away. Then Rafiki watches and cheers as Simba runs off, announcing that he's going back.Timon and Pumbaa are sleeping together as Nala approaches them and nudges them awake, frightening them at first. She asks if they've seen Simba but Rafiki appears overhead and declares that the king has returned. Confused by this statement and Rafikis mysterious arrival and departure, Timon and Pumbaa listen as Nala tries to explain that Simba has decided to go back to the Pride Lands to take his place as king.Crossing the desert, Simba finally arrives in the Pride Lands to find it dark and barren. He eyes Pride Rock with a look of vengeance when Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa appear beside him. They all agree to help Simba reclaim the throne, though Timon is less than impressed by the landscape they're fighting for. They sneak over to Pride Rock and discover that its crawling with hyenas. Simba offers Timon and Pumbaa as live bait and they do put on a colorful performance for the hungry hyenas while he and Nala move closer. Simba instructs Nala to rally the lionesses while he looks for Scar. He finds him at the base of Pride Rock, calling loudly for Sarabi. Hyenas nip at her heels as she approaches and Simba looks on mournfully. Scar questions her as to why the lionesses refuse to hunt. Sarabi explains that the herds have moved on and their only chance for survival is to leave Pride Rock. Scar refuses and, when Sarabi compares him to Mufasa, he cruelly hits her. Having seen enough, Simba appears on a ledge and runs down to comfort his mother. Scar backs away, fearful that its Mufasa that has returned, but when he realizes who it really is, he shoots a hateful glare at Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Simba confronts Scar, demanding that he step down from the throne or fight, but sly Scar asks why things must end in violence and says he would feel terrible if he were responsible for the death of a family member. Though Simba says he's put the past behind him, Scar questions whether the lionesses have done the same. When Nala questions this, Scar prompts Simba to tell them all who was responsible for Mufasas death. Sadly, Simba confesses that he was, though it was an accident. Scar uses this and accuses Simba of being a murderer, backing him up to the end of Pride Rock to the point where Simba slips over the edge, dangling by his paws. Lightning strikes and ignites a fire beneath him as Scar looks over him, remarking that this was just the way Mufasa looked before he died. Then Scar grabs Simbas paws and whispers in his ear that he was the one to kill Mufasa.Enraged, Simba leaps over the edge and pins Scar, choking him to confess the truth to the lionesses. Fighting immediately breaks out between the hyenas and the lions. Timon and Pumbaa join the fray with their signature bowling moves and Rafiki impresses with some acrobatic martial arts. When Timon is cornered by Shenzi and Banzai in the lions den with Zazu, Pumbaa comes to the rescue, his fury provoked when Banzai accidentally calls him a pig.Scar manages to slip away from the fighting but is followed by Simba. They meet at the top of Pride Rock surrounded by flames where Scar begs for his life, saying that he's family and that the hyenas are the real enemy. Having heard this, the hyenas back away growling. Simba relents, saying that he's not like Scar and tells him to run away and never return. Scar meekly walks past him but sends a pile of embers into Simbas face, blinding him for a moment. Scar then attacks Simba and a fierce fight ensues. Scar manages to knock Simba down and leaps at him but, using the technique Nala had mastered in her pinning, Simba flips Scar with his hind legs over the edge of Pride Rock. Scar tumbles down the rock face and lands at the base. He groggily stands up and notices the hyenas approaching him from between the flames. He greets them as his friends but they respond that he said they were the enemy. Scar looks at them in horror as they lick their lips and surround him before attacking.Rain begins to fall and Simba returns to the lionesses where he greets his mother and Nala. Rafiki rattles his staff and points it towards the tip of Pride Rock. He bows to Simba, who gives him a hug, and says it is time. As everyone watches, and as the rain washes away dust and bones, Simba ascends Pride Rock, gazing one last time at the heavens before letting out a mighty roar and sealing his position as king. The lionesses join in, hailing their new king. Some time later, the animals of the Pride Lands gather once again at Pride Rock, cheering at Simba and Nala as they overlook the kingdom. Rafiki comes between them and holds up their newborn cub for all to see."
Forrest Gump,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The history of the United States from the 1950s to the '70s unfolds from the perspective of an Alabama man with an IQ of 75, who yearns to be reunited with his childhood sweetheart. Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.—aliw135 The movie Forrest Gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. Gump faces many tribulations throughout his life, but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. From wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average IQ and even being shot, Gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. While several less than ideal things occur during Gump's life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. This skill allows Gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in Greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers' lives and become famous for his ability. While Gump eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie, it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend Jenny Curran. The movie is centered on Forrest Gump and the incidences that occur during his life, but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of Jenny and how important she is to him. Although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship, as the movie progresses they grow apart. This upsets Gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life, and it seems the two always end up back in each other's lives, often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the Reflection Pond in D.C. Even though Gump is the main character of the film, it similarly tells the story of Curran and the hardships she faces.—Kathryn Logue Slow-witted Forrest Gump has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother, he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny.—Jwelch5742 Forrest Gump, an innocent and kind-hearted Alabama boy, has been dealing with other people's unkindness nearly all his life. Having grown up with beautiful Jenny, his only friend, Forrest yearns to learn all about the ways of the world and embarks on a mission to find his true purpose in life. Thrust into downright extraordinary situations, Forrest finds himself present at some of the most pivotal events in the second half of the 20th century, rubbing shoulders with influential and historical figures, includingJohn F. Kennedy,Richard Nixon, a nice young man from England namedJohn Lennon, and even a handsome but still unknownElvis Presley. Throughout his existence, Forrest has been encountering life's randomness; however, in this earth, no one is insignificant. With his presence alone, one builds his own place in this world, unknowingly changing the flow of things, while fate floats like a feather in the wind. But, in this life-altering journey, is Forrest meant to find his destiny, and be with Jenny?—Nick Riganas The film begins with a feather falling to the feet of Forrest Gump who is sitting at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia. Forrest picks up the feather and puts it in the book Curious George, then tells the story of his life to a woman seated next to him. The listeners at the bus stop change regularly throughout his narration, each showing a different attitude ranging from disbelief and indifference to rapt veneration.On his first day of school, he meets a girl named Jenny, whose life is followed in parallel to Forrest's at times. Having discarded his leg braces, his ability to run at lightning speed gets him into college on a football scholarship. After his college graduation, he enlists in the army and is sent to Vietnam, where he makes fast friends with a black man named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him when the war is over. Later while on patrol, Forrest's platoon is attacked. Though Forrest rescues many of the men, Bubba is killed in action. Forrest is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism.While Forrest is in recovery for a bullet shot to his ""butt-tox"", he discovers his uncanny ability for ping-pong, eventually gaining popularity and rising to celebrity status, later playing ping-pong competitively against Chinese teams. At an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. Forrest reunites with Jenny, who has been living a hippie counterculture lifestyle.Returning home, Forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles, earning himself $25,000, which he uses to buy a shrimping boat, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. His commanding officer from Vietnam, Lieutenant Dan, joins him. Though initially Forrest has little success, after finding his boat the only surviving boat in the area after Hurricane Carmen, he begins to pull in huge amounts of shrimp and uses it to buy an entire fleet of shrimp boats. Lt. Dan invests the money in Apple Computer and Forrest is financially secure for the rest of his life. He returns home to see his mother's last days.One day, Jenny returns to visit Forrest and he proposes marriage to her. She declines, though feels obliged to prove her love to him by sleeping with him. She leaves early the next morning. On a whim, Forrest elects to go for a run. Seemingly capriciously, he decides to keep running across the country several times, over some three and a half years, becoming famous.In present-day, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny who, having seen him run on television, asks him to visit her. Once he is reunited with Jenny, Forrest discovers she has a young son, of whom Forrest is the father. Jenny tells Forrest she is suffering from a virus (probably HIV, though this is never definitively stated). Together the three move back to Greenbow, Alabama. Jenny and Forrest finally marry. The wedding is attended by Lt. Dan, who now has prosthetic legs and a fiancee. Jenny dies soon afterward.The film ends with father and son waiting for the school bus on little Forrest's first day of school. Opening the book his son is taking to school, the white feather from the beginning of the movie is seen to fall from within the pages. As the bus pulls away, the white feather is caught on a breeze and drifts skyward."

But in this time-sensitive, white-knuckle double mission, there is no room for error. Can Harry's true lies save the day?—Nick Riganas Location: Lake Chapeau, SwitzerlandLate on a wintery night, security guards are screening cars for their official invitations for a black-tie event at a château. Other security guards armed with submachine guns and guard dogs patrol the grounds, and spotlights shine around. Underwater in a canal that passes through the yard, professional spy Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger), wearing scuba diving gear, cuts through the gate with a torch. He breaks through the ice on the other side of the gate with a large knife and removes his headgear, then sets a leather bag on the ice and gets out.Harry hides behind the boathouse and removes a walkie-talkie from the bag and says, ""Honey, I'm home"" to his partners Albert ""Gib"" Gibson (Tom Arnold) and Faisil (Grant Heslov), parked in a surveillance van across the lake. Harry removes his scuba gear, revealing a tuxedo, and puts on his gun. He then puts on a radio earpiece, then his coat, and then places a radio-controlled explosive device on a barrel of benzene and puts on some cologne from a small bottle.Following advice from Gib, Harry sneaks into the mansion through the service door. After passing through the kitchen, a cook confronts him in French. Harry responds in French, acting all important and criticizing the feast displayed on the table. He grabs a glass of wine and walks into the ballroom. The orchestra plays ""the Blue Danube"" as Harry greets a sheik in Arabic. Gib asks Harry if he has seen Jamel Khaled yet, and Harry responds that he does. Another woman, Juno Skinner, (Tia Carrere) greets Khaled (Marshall Manesh), then watches Harry as he checks her out. Harry bumps into and greets a colonel, who doesn't know him. Harry ditches his drink and goes through the main foyer and to the second floor. He goes into the library then to the second-floor balcony. He climbs up the wall to the third floor, quietly breaks into the room there, hooks up a modem to a computer and transmits files to his partners in the van. Faisil begins decrypting the files.Harry comes out of a second story room and asks the security man in Arabic where the bathroom is, who informs him that it's downstairs. Back in the foyer, Harry pretends to examine some large sculptures on a desk, then sees some more security guards rushing upstairs. Juno walks up to Harry, and he remarks that the sculpture is magnificent. She tells Harry that she doesn't recognize him as one of Khaled's friends and has never met him before. Harry introduces himself as ""Harry Renquist"" and Juno introduces herself. Gib quickly does a background check revealing that Juno is an arts and antiquities dealer, specializing in Ancient Persian antiques. Harry remarks that the sculpture is Persian, and she says that it's sixth century B.C. He claims that he adores the period.Things go awry when a security guard discovers the break in the ice and alerts others on the radio of a breach. Security guards scramble outside, and Gib informs Harry. Harry sees the three security guards come downstairs, so he takes Juno to dance the tango, ""Por Una Cabeza"", which now plays in the ballroom. Gib informs Harry that he doesn't have time to tango. While dancing, Harry constantly looks around at security. Juno clearly enjoys the way Harry dances with her. Gib tells Harry to get out of there.Faisil finally decrypts the files and starts copying them. After the dance, Harry and Juno leave the ballroom, and she's impressed. Harry tells her that he has to leave because he has a plane to catch, and she gives him a business card from her dress top, telling him that her offices are in Rome. Gib makes a snide remark because Juno is smitten with Harry.Outside, Harry informs Gib that he's going to simply walk right out the front gate. A security guard confronts Harry and asks him in English for his invitation. Harry pulls out a small metal case, saying that it's his invitation, then remotely sets off an explosive charge at the boat house. Harry knocks out the security guard, then changes his plans and runs across the yard. Security sets two dogs on him, and he bumps their heads together. Several armed men on snowmobiles and skis chase after Harry, but he shoots them as he runs downhill to the backup rendezvous point. When Harry finally reaches the van, he shoots down two more armed men approaching on skis, and then gets in the van and they drive away.The team flies back to Washington, DC. Gib drives Harry home. Before Harry gets out, he ditches his Renquist ID, and Gib supplies him his real billfold and some items to support a supposed trip to Geneva, including a passport, ticket stub, a hotel bill, two postcards, house keys, and a souvenir Swiss village snow globe for Harry's daughter Dana. Harry tells Gib to pick him up tomorrow at eight o'clock. Gib finally gives Harry his wedding ring, and then drives away. Harry carries the snow globe, a suitcase, and luggage up the steps to his house, and then picks up a newspaper before he opens the front door. He quietly enters his bedroom then climbs into bed. His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) groggily asks him how his flight was, and then they sleep.The next day, Harry gives the snow globe to his daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) and tells her that she's late for school, and not to forget to feed her dog Gizmo. After Harry leaves, she tells Gizmo that the snow globe is lame and throws it away.While Harry and Helen get ready for work, they talk about his trip, which he had previously told her was a salesman convention. He continues the pretense, saying that his team was the hit of the show. Helen tells him that the plumber called, and it will cost $600. He says its OK and asks what she told the plumber. She jokes that she slept with the plumber and he will deduct $100. Harry tells her that it's good thinking and kisses her goodbye.Gib strolls in through the unlocked front door, and after looking around, sets a pack of cigarettes on the fireplace mantle. The pack is actually a CCD video camera, which he aims at his own jacket on a chair. Dana's boyfriend rides up on his motorcycle. Gib gives a pair of sunglasses to Harry, which is actually the remote receiving unit for the video camera. In the glasses, Harry sees Dana swiping money from his jacket, but she runs outside quickly before Harry can talk to her, and she rides off with her boyfriend to school.On the way to work, Gib, married three times, tells Harry discouraging assumptions about Dana. He suggests that she's probably having sex with her boyfriend. Harry says that Dana wouldn't do that. Gib continues, saying that she could be stealing the money for an abortion or drugs. As they walk through an X-Ray tunnel at work, Gib, says that he moved back in with his ex-wife to have a better chance of getting the house during the settlement. They pass through two security checkpoints, including a palm, retina, and voice scanner. They finally take an elevator to their agency, the Omega Sector, ""The last line of defense"".The head of Omega Sector, the eyepatch-wearing Spencer Trilby (Charlton Heston), rebukes Harry, calling the mission in Switzerland a total disaster. Harry tries to defend himself, and Gib and Faisil pitch in. Faisil produces evidence of $100 million Jamel Khaled transferred from a bank known as a terrorist front. He also says that 4 MIRV warheads (nuclear weapons) were smuggled out of Kazakhstan. Harry says that they think Khaled's group bought the nukes and will try to bring them to the United States. The mostly unimpressed Spencer tells them to produce hard evidence before terrorists try to detonate a nuke outside the White House.While Helen is at work, she talks to her coworker Allison (Katsy Chappell) about Harry's supposedly boring life as a sales representative. Helen says that when she can't sleep she asks him about his supposed job and it puts her quickly to sleep.Gib and Faisil show Harry proof of a $2 million disbursement from Khaled to Juno Skinner. Although Khaled gets his antiquities from her, the transaction is suspicious because the money came from another ledger; this is too much money for sex, even for someone as attractive as her. Harry tells them to do a complete work-up on her. The team decides to send Harry to her local offices in Washington D.C.At Juno's offices, Harry resumes the Harry Renquist alias, now claiming to be the representative for a corporate art consulting company in San Francisco. Juno immediately recognizes Harry and is surprised to see him so soon. He pretends that he's buying something for some clients. As they walk through a large bay containing recent arrived antiques from the Middle East, he tells her that he learned she can read ancient Sanskrit without sounding out the words. He also claims that other art dealers and archaeologists don't like her very much. She replies that it's because she uses her diplomatic contacts to export items from countries that would rather not sell. The entire time, Harry is observed from across the room by Juno's employer Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik). Juno tells Harry that most of their items come from ancient Persia, which is buried deep under sand in Iran, Iraq, and Syria -- making them hard to obtain. As a result, she has had to become an expert in international diplomacy.Back at Harry's suite at the Marquis Hotel, where they set up a fake office, Gib tells Harry that Juno could be moving money, guns, or other dangerous items. Faisil tells Harry that as soon as he left Juno's office, the team received several calls to the phones, checking out Harry's alias name. Harry tells them to step up surveillance of Juno and put on two more guys.Aziz comes into Juno's office and slaps her, calling her a derogatory name in Arabic. He switches to English, calling her a stupid undisciplined bitch. She tolerates this insult, since Aziz is paying her a lot of money to smuggle his nuclear warheads into the United States. He tells her that surveillance teams are watching them and probably tapped the phones. He criticizes her for ""flirting like a whore"" with Harry, and slaps her again. He tells her to find out where Harry is.Helen calls Harry at his office at ""Tektel Systems"", the front organization for the Omega Sector. The telephone operator transfers the call to his hotel suite. Helen tells Harry that she and Dana are preparing him a birthday party and hope he will be home by 8:00 at night. Harry assures her that he will be home in time.Gib drives Harry home in an SUV and informs him that someone is tailing them. Harry calls Faisil, who is in the van, and tells him to meet him at the Georgetown Park mall in three minutes. When Gib parks, Harry gets out and crosses the street, using his cigarette camera to watch the two henchmen who got out and are now following him. Aziz stays behind in the tailing car. Gib calls Helen and tells her that Harry will be late because he forgot something at the office. Sitting in front of Harry's birthday cake, Dana tells Helen, ""See.""Harry walks into the mall, then goes straight for a men's room, setting up his camera on the sink, then pretends to use a urinal. An old man is sitting in one of the toilet stalls. The first henchman enters the bathroom and combs his hair. Outside, a bus pulls up between Gib and the trailing car. When the bus leaves, Aziz is gone, and Gib informs Harry. The second henchman enters the bathroom and draws a suppressed pistol, but Harry sees him and dodges the thug's shot. Harry knocks the pistol out of the thug's hand, but the first henchman draws his machine pistol. Harry draws his pistol and shoots him, causing his weapon to fire wildly all around the bathroom before he falls dead. The second henchman knocks Harry's pistol down. Harry kicks the henchman's pistol away before the thug can grab it. After a fierce fight, Harry rips a hand dryer off the wall and strikes it across the henchman's face, then pushes him into a urinal, knocking him out. Harry handcuffs him.At that point, Aziz enters, submachine gun in hand. He opens fire on Harry, but Harry turns the henchman he just overpowered into a human shield who absorbs the bullets, then ducks for cover in the other side of the bathroom. Aziz sprays the stalls on that side and walks across the bathroom, kicking open each stall as he searches for Harry. Harry jumps out of the last stall before Aziz reaches it and retrieves his weapon. As Aziz runs out of the bathroom he fires at Harry. While Harry chases after Aziz, Aziz reloads and runs into the mall.Aziz jumps through a glass window of one of the mall shops, and he shoots at Gib, who has finally caught up. Despite Gib only having the slim cover of a lamppost, none of Aziz's bullets hit him. Harry jumps through the window and chases after Aziz down the street. Aziz flees by yanking a rider off a passing motorcycle, while Harry commandeers a mounted policeman's horse to give chase. Gib and Faisil catch up in the SUV and van and block Aziz's path, but he rides into a Marriott hotel with Harry close behind. They reach the parking garage and Gib and Faisil catch up again. Aziz rides into one of the glass elevators and takes a woman hostage. Harry takes another glass elevator and follows Aziz to the top floor balcony. Aziz rides through the glass barrier and jumps off the balcony, down into a swimming pool on the roof of an adjacent building across the street. Harry tries to follow him, but the horse balks and Harry flies off and dangles by the reins, losing his gun in the process. He gets the horse to back up and then scolds the horse as if it were a cop.When Gib drops Harry off, Helen is asleep at the table. The cake is still there, and balloons are all around. When Harry comes in, waking Helen, he apologizes to her. She's upset but accepts his apology.Harry accesses the database at work and identifies Aziz. The team informs Spencer that Aziz is a fanatical major terrorist, wanted for a large number of car bombings, and also responsible for bombing a café a year ago and a passenger plane prior to that. He is nicknamed the ""Sand Spider"", and has formed his own splinter faction called the ""Crimson Jihad"". Harry assures Spencer that they will get Aziz.Harry stops by Helen's job to check if she's available for lunch, to try to smooth over their relationship. Just as Harry is about to reach her cubicle, Helen's coworker Allison tells her that her mystery man is on the phone. Helen takes the call from ""Simon"" while Harry stands back at another cubicle and listens. Helen agrees to meet Simon right now and rushes out, with Allison giving her approval of presumed sex from the ""stud"". Harry leaves the building in a daze and walks into traffic. Gib pulls Harry out of the street, thinking that he is sick. Harry tells Gib that Helen is having an affair. Gib is relieved and happy, telling Harry that the same thing happened with his second wife. He tells Harry that Helen still loves Harry but just wants to bang the guy for a while. Harry gets upset, but Gib tells him that it's because Harry is never home. Gib gets Harry back in the SUV and tells him to concentrate on work, catching terrorists and beating them up to feel better.At home, Harry angrily eats dinner with his family. He tells Helen that he went to her office to have lunch with her, but she makes up an excuse about taking documents to the district courthouse. Her words drone away at the end. He pretends to accept her excuse, with a veiled furious smirk.At work, Gib tells Harry that Spencer has given them permission to wiretap all of Juno's shipping agents and clients. Faisil has also made a list of possible contacts of Crimson Jihad in the United States. Harry stops walking and stares into space. Harry tells Gib to put wiretaps on his home phone and Helen's phone at her work, but Gib objects; Harry pushes Gib and insists. Later, Harry reads the transcript of Helen's latest phone conversation with Simon. She has agreed to meet him for lunch tomorrow ""at the same place"", and he finished the conversation with ""I need you."" Harry angrily wads up the paper.At home after work, Harry asks Helen to go with him to lunch tomorrow. She lies, saying that she's going shopping with Allison. Harry secretly takes Helen's purse and tosses it through the bathroom window to Gib waiting outside in the pouring rain. Harry walks Dana's dog to the surveillance van and retrieves the purse from Gib, who has sewn various monitoring devices into the lining of the purse.The next day, Harry and Gib tail Helen in the SUV as she drives to her appointment with Simon in Chinatown. They listen to her conversation with him inside a Chinese restaurant. Simon (Bill Paxton) tells her that he may have to leave suddenly. He tells her that she's the only one he can trust, and says that he just got back from covert operations, which was worse than his mission in Cairo. Gib and Harry begin to think Simon is a spook (a spy) who is using Helen to get to Harry, but then they determine he is a fraud when Simon shows Helen a newspaper article about Harry's shootout with Aziz and tries to take credit for it.Simon is actually a used car salesman. After meeting with Helen, he drives back to his dealership in a 1959 Corvette convertible, which is for sale for $17,599. Harry goes into the lot, pretending to be interested in the Corvette. As they go for a test drive in the Corvette, Simon is sure that Harry is interested in picking up women. He tells Harry that he still has to have an ""angle"". When they stop to eat, Simon tells Harry that he targets bored housewives, and creates a fantasy of adventure and danger for them. Harry says that he couldn't lie like that. Harry asks about their husbands, and Simon replies, ""If they took care of business, I'd be out of business."" On the way back to the dealership, Harry asks Simon whom he's working on right now. Simon describes Helen, an ""uptight conservative"" legal secretary, married to a boring jerk, who has an incredible body and breasts that ""make you want to stand up and beg for buttermilk. Ass like a 10-year-old boy."" Harry envisions hitting Simon in the face but doesn't. Harry asks if she's good in bed, but they reach the lot before he can answer. Harry guns the engine, spinning the car into the lot, and parking perfectly. Simon asks Harry if he wants to buy the car, so Harry tells Simon to hold it for him for a day.At night, Gib shows Harry the day's transcript of Helen's wiretaps. Harry suddenly pulls the SUV over and they get out. He demands to see the missing page then punches and breaks the SUV window. Gib reluctantly gives it to him. As Harry reads the paper, the camera shows Simon talking on the phone with Helen. They agree to meet on K Street under the Key Bridge at 8:00. When they hang up, Simon shoots BBs at a silhouette target with an air pistol. The GPS in Helen's purse shows that it's still at the house, and it's almost 8:00, so Harry and Gib race to get to the bridge in time. Harry calls other agents off priority surveillance to intercept Helen and Simon, and Gib objects the misuse of Omega Sector resources. Harry replies that if Gib tells on him, Harry will tell on Gib. He informs Gib that he knows Gib blew a 6-week operation because he was busy getting oral sex, so Gib agrees to participate. Simon picks up Helen with the Corvette, and then as he drives, he tells her to put her head down until they get out of the city. An Omega Sector agent reports that Helen has her head in his lap. As Simon goes over the bridge, a helicopter follows them and confirms it. Gib suggests that Helen could be sleepy.Simon parks the car at a run down trailer park and tells her that his trailer is a safe house. He tells her that his other places are ""too hot"" right now. Inside his trailer, Simon asks Helen to pose as his wife for an ""operation"" in Paris because others are looking for a man traveling alone. Meanwhile outside, the Omega Sector agents get dressed in night gear. Simon tells Helen that she's the only one he can trust because there's a double agent in his outfit. Helen agrees to go, and Simon compliments her on how brave she is. He sits on the couch next to her and tells her that they have to appear that they are intimate with each other. He takes off her glasses and starts kissing her, causing her great discomfort. Helen finally kicks him away and tells him that she can't do it. Suddenly the lights go out and the Omega Sector agents cut open the end of the trailer, shining the helicopter's spotlight inside. Simon trips and falls on Helen. Harry, wearing a balaclava, sees Simon on his wife, and enraged, drags him outside and handcuffs him. After a struggle, Helen is handcuffed as well. The two then have hoods thrown over their heads and are loaded into the back of a van.At an interrogation room with a two-way mirror, Harry and Gib use a voice distorter to mask their voices while they question Helen. Harry asks Helen about her ties with ""the international terrorist Carlos the Jackal"", but she claims innocence, saying that she just met Simon ""or whoever you say he is"" two weeks ago and barely knows him. Harry asks Helen how she met Simon.In a flashback, Simon approaches Helen in the Chinese restaurant and leave his briefcase with her, telling her it's for national security, before he leaves quickly. She takes the briefcase to work and picks the locks, finding a passport, maps of other countries, and the air pistol we saw earlier; then she frantically closes it.Back in the interrogation room, Harry asks Helen why she continued seeing Simon, so she says that he needed her help. Gib asks her inappropriate questions about cheating on Harry, but she says that she didn't. When Harry asks Helen about her husband, she says that Harry is a sales representative for a computer company, and is a good man. Harry asks her why she went to Carlos's hideout, and she says that he wanted her to go to Paris with him on a mission and pose as his wife. She says that she agreed because she needed to feel alive, and to do something outrageous; it felt good to be needed and trusted and special. Harry asks her if she slept with Simon, and she says no and starts crying.Harry asks her again and she gets extremely upset, slamming the stool against the mirror and cracking it. The last question Harry asks her is if she still loves him. She says yes, that she always did and always will love him. Harry tells Gib that he's giving Helen an assignment because she wants adventure. He gives her a choice to work for them and they will drop the charges against her; otherwise she will go to a federal prison. Helen agrees (of course). Harry says that a man code named ""Boris"" will contact her with the assignment; Helen's code name is ""Doris"". They drop her off at her car and she's still extremely upset.Harry and Gib take Simon, who is wearing only his underwear, to the top of a dam, holding him by the floodgates. Harry accuses him of being the terrorist Carlos, but he says that his name is Simon. Harry and Gib take off their ski masks. Simon recognizes Harry and tries again to sell the Corvette to him. Gib tells Carlos that his terrorist career is well documented, but Simon insists that he only sells used cars. Simon also insists that he's not a terrorist or a spy, but is a coward. Harry points his gun at Simon's face, and Simon fearfully tells them again that he's not a spy, that he lies to sleep around with women, but does not score much. He then pisses himself out of fear, proving that he's not a spy. Harry and Gib drive away and leave Simon at the dam, lost and bewildered.The next day Harry asks Helen about last night. Helen trembles then lies to Harry that she had a flat tire, and the tow truck driver took a long time to arrive. The phone rings and Helen answers it. It's Gib on the phone, using a voice distorter and calling her ""Doris"". He tells her to go to the Hotel Marquis in exactly one hour, and pick up an envelope marked ""Doris"" at the front desk. He tells her to wear something sexy. Harry's coworker Jean-Claude (Jean-Claude Parachini) records an audiotape of instructions. Gib criticizes Harry for using Omega Sector funds for the suite.Helen arrives at the hotel wearing a frilly evening gown and picks up the envelope, which contains a phone number and an electronic bug. She calls the phone number and Gib (voice distorted) tells her to go to the suite and pose as a prostitute named Michelle. He tells her that a suspected arms dealer is waiting for her in the room. Gib tells her that the man only likes to watch; she should tell him that his regular girl Carla is sick. Gib tells her that if the man likes her he will give her instructions. He finally tells her to plant the bug near the telephone by the plant before she leaves, otherwise the deal is off.Gib hangs up and Helen walks to the suite, passing a mirror. She rips off the sleeves from her dress, and then rips the bottom and top of her dress off, exposing cleavage. She adds more lipstick and mascara, and then wets her hair using water from a vase. Satisfied that she looks like a prostitute, she puts the bug in her bra and enters the suite. When she opens the door, she quickly puts her wedding ring on the other hand. Harry sits in the shadows at the far side of the bedroom. He greets her using the tape recording from Jean-Claude, and continues to speak through the tape player. He tells her to have some champagne, and then tells her to come to the bedroom. She informs him that her name is Michelle, and Carla thought he might like her. Harry tells her that he will do the talking.Harry orders her by tape recorder to remove her dress, making her turn around and do it ""doucement"" and very slowly, and then orders her to dance sexily for him. As she dances in her bra and panties, she becomes more uninhibited, dancing almost like a professional stripper. The song ""Alone in the Dark"" by John Hiatt plays while she dances. Harry is surprised so much that he drops the tape player but picks it back up. Harry tells her to lie on the bed and close her eyes. He puts the tape player down and approaches her, holding a long stem red rose. He sits on the bed and puts the rose to her nose, then runs it down her face and between her breasts. Finally he kisses her. She moans and grabs the phone and hits him in the head with it. When he falls to the floor, she puts on her dress, and then kicks him in the ribs calling him a pig and a bastard. Finally she sticks the bug on the lamp stand and starts to run out.Harry calls out to her and makes her stop, then starts to explain. Suddenly, several armed gunmen burst through the doors, shouting orders in Arabic and English. Harry tells Helen not to do anything. Still stuck in spy mode, Helen tells the men that she's the one they want. Harry tells her to be quiet and cooperate with the men, then tells the men to let the hooker (Helen) go. As the men take Harry and Helen out, Helen tells Harry to let her handle it.The men take Harry and Helen to a private jet. Juno gets out of a limousine and greets Harry. Helen tells Juno that she is Helen Tasker, and Harry is her husband, but he insists that she's a hooker that he met in a bar. On the jet Helen continues, saying that they have a daughter, and shows Juno a locket with Harry and Helen's pictures. The flight attendant then tranquilizes Helen and Harry. Right before he succumbs to the tranquilizer, Juno remarks that Helen really had no idea of Harry's secret life.Harry and Helen arrive at Aziz's terrorist camp in a helicopter. In a warehouse, Juno shows Harry and Helen four giant statues from ancient Persia. She calls the statues ""the four horsemen"", and says that they are priceless.The terrorists rip open one of the statues and remove a large case containing a Soviet nuclear warhead. With a cameraman is filming the event, Aziz asks Harry if he knows what the weapon is, and Harry jokes about it. Aziz holds a knife to Helen's neck, telling her that they brought Harry and Helen there so Harry can tell the world about the weapon, and that the world will know that the Crimson Jihad is a nuclear power. Helen wonders how Harry can do that, as she only has been left thinking he's a computer salesman. Harry reluctantly describes the weapon, a Soviet MIRV-6, and then tells Aziz in Arabic to release Helen and he will cooperate. Aziz orders his men to remove the warheads from the other statues. Harry admits to Helen that he's a spy, so she punches him, knocking him off his feet and calls him a bastard, a lying son of a bitch, and a pig. Juno is amused. Harry continues describing the weapon in front of the camera.The chauffeur rifles through Helen's purse. Harry says that he can verify that they are able to detonate all four warheads. Aziz then rants in front of the camera, saying, ""You have killed our women and our children, bombed our cities from afar like cowards, and you dare to call us terrorists? Now, the oppressed have been given a mighty sword with which to strike back at their enemies."" The camera displays a low battery warning as Aziz continues his diatribe by warning, ""Unless you, America, pulls all military forces out of the Persian Gulf area immediately and forever, the Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major U.S. city each week until our demands are met. First, we will detonate one weapon on this uninhabited island as a demonstration of our power..."" The cameraman lowers the camera and informs Aziz that the battery died. Aziz angrily calls him a moron and orders him to find another one. The chauffeur finds a transmitter sewn into the lining of Helen's purse, but she says that it's not hers. Meanwhile, Gib and other Omega Sector men leave Miami in a jet, then Gib calls for two DEA helicopters. Faisil locates the purse on an island in the Florida Keys, past Marathon, before Aziz crushes the transmitter under his boot and the signal dies.The men take Harry and Helen to a small building where Samir (Charles Cragin), Aziz's interrogator, is preparing his instruments. He injects Harry with a vial of truth serum, then says that he will return after it takes effect. Harry asks Juno why she's helping these raving psychotics. She replies that they are paying her a lot of money; she doesn't care about their cause or Harry's. Harry calls her damaged goods. Juno asks if Harry if he told Helen about herself and Harry. He says there is no ""us"", and calls her a psychopathic bitch. Juno kisses him and leaves. Harry assures Helen that there was nothing between him and Juno.As the truth serum takes effect, Harry's sight and hearing become distorted, and he becomes groggy. Helen asks Harry what they gave him, and he tells her that it's likely sodium amytol or some other serum. She asks him if they are going to die, and he says yes, then describes possible ways the terrorists could kill them. She asks him how long he has been a spy, and he answers: 17 years. When she asks if he ever killed anyone, he replies, ""Yeah, but they were all bad."" Aziz finds a photo of Dana in Helen's wallet and decides she might be useful to his plans.Samir returns and prepares to torture Harry. Before he begins, he asks Harry if he has anything he'd like to admit to. Harry says that he will kill him very soon. Samir asks how, and then Harry provides a step-by-step description of how he will do it, amusing Samir, until Harry reveals that he's picked his handcuffs. Then, Harry kills Samir in the very way he just described: he grabs Samir, collars him as a human shield, then grabs a sharp instrument off the table and throws it, lodging in the eye of the henchman guarding the door, and lastly, breaks Samir's neck. A henchman comes to the door to investigate, and Harry stabs him with a butcher's hook and takes his pistol. He frees Helen and they leave the building. They hide behind a truck and observe Aziz and the terrorists in a pep rally, reciting slogans and shooting their weapons. Other terrorists find Samir and the guard and shoot at Harry and Helen as they run away. Harry comes out from hiding behind some crates and grabs an AKM assault rifle, striking and killing the men with it in close combat. He kills the last two men with their own knives. He shoots more men with another AKM. When one man grabs Helen, Harry shoots him with the pistol, shocking her. He grabs the guy's MAC-10.Aziz stops the rally and starts lecturing his men in Arabic. As Harry and Helen watch, Aziz arms the first warhead and sets it for 1 hour 30 minutes. Harry translates for Helen: ""It is done. In 90 minutes a pillar of holy fire will light up the skies to show to the world that we speak the truth..."" The terrorists cover the warhead with an American flag and seal the crate with concrete. ""...We are set on our course. No force can stop us now. We're cool, we're bad-asses, blah blah blah blah."" Harry stops translating for Helen. Helen asks why they are using trucks if they are on an island, and Harry tells her that they must be in the Florida Keys, and can use the Overseas Highway to get to the mainland.Harry tells Helen that they are the only ones who can stop the men. He gives her the MAC-10. As the men begin loading the warheads on the trucks, Harry sneaks up on two of the men and kills them quietly. He grabs an AKM then throws a grenade by some barrels of gasoline, exploding flaming gasoline on several terrorists. Harry shoots out the lights then shoots more men. He draws the pistol but another terrorist knocks it away and grabs him from behind, then calls the others. Harry tells Helen to shoot them, but when she tries the recoil knocks the MAC-10 out of her hands and it tumbles down the stairs. It continues firing as it tumbles, shooting several terrorists, including the one that was holding Harry, and then it runs out bullets and lands on a step. More men arrive and shoot at Harry, so Helen hides while Harry shoots a MAC-10 at them. Some of the men load the last warhead on a helicopter then it flies away. Harry grabs two more MAC-10s from dead guys and shoots at the men. He then finds a fueling truck and uses the nozzle as a flamethrower, igniting the gasoline with bullets. Aziz grabs a LAW rocket launcher and shoots at the truck, forcing Harry to dive into the water and swim to safety. The men cheer, thinking that Harry is dead, and Helen sits back forlorn.Juno and Aziz take Helen as a hostage. Harry finally comes up for air in time to see the terrorists take Helen away in a limousine. Aziz looks at the destruction, and then gets in the helicopter, sitting on the warhead. The trucks drive on the highway with the helicopter flying overhead. Gib and other Omega Sector agents arrive on the island in helicopters and pick up Harry; Harry briefs them in the air.Gib makes calls to evacuate people a safe distance from the island. Harry informs the White House and Gib calls for two Marine Corps Harrier jets. Meanwhile, Juno pours champagne while holding her Beretta pistol on Helen. The Harrier jets arrive and destroy the lead truck with machine gun fire. Men in the third truck attempt to shoot a Harrier with a Stinger missile, but aim it backwards. The missile's blast kills one of their men when he flies through the windshield and is run over. The Harrier jet avoids the missile. The jets shoot out the bridge with Maverick missiles, taking the second truck with it. The third truck stops at the edge of the bridge, balancing precariously over the drop. A pelican briefly lands on the dash, and the truck falls over the edge and explodes. While shouting instructions to the chauffeur, Juno gets distracted and Helen fights with her for the Beretta. One bullet hits the chauffeur in the head, killing him. As the car races out of control, the two women continue to fight for the gun. Helen knocks the gun away through the open sunroof. Finally Helen knocks Juno in the head with the champagne bottle. Harry stands on the helicopter skid and reaches for Helen, who is standing through the sunroof, and grabs her arm. Juno recovers just in time to see Harry pull Helen to safety, then sees the destroyed bridge ahead as the limousine plunges off the bridge into the water.The jets and the helicopters land on the highway at the end of the bridge. Gib uses a bullhorn and tells everyone to not look at the flash. Harry has a tender moment with Helen and puts the wedding ring on her correct finger. As the warhead detonates, sending up the classic mushroom cloud, Harry and Helen kiss. Gib calls Harry over and informs him that Aziz's helicopter landed on a high-rise building in Miami; they rendezvoused there with a dozen other faction members; they are on the 20th floor; SWAT is there and the cops have cordoned off the area. He finally tells Harry that they are holding Dana hostage. Gib tries to calm Harry down, but Harry runs to one of the jets and commandeers it. Gib explains to the pilots that on order from the President they have to give total cooperation. Gib reminds Harry that he hasn't flown a Harrier jet in 10 years. Harry tells him that if he breaks it, they can take it out of his pay. After a rough liftoff, Harry finally flies off toward Miami.Aziz watches the TV news reports and sees himself on the tape that was released to the media. Dana sits on a stool close by. Upon request by the Crimson Jihad, a video crew comes upstairs. Aziz arms the warhead then walks away to speak to his men, but leaves the key in the warhead arming box. The cameraman is Faisil.While Harry flies toward Miami in the jet, Faisil films Aziz as he lectures the United States. Aziz looks at the warhead arming box and sees that the key is missing. Dana, holding the key, runs up the stairs to the roof. Aziz and some of his men chase after her. Faisil pulls out a pistol from a hidden compartment in the camera and shoots the other Crimson Jihad men there. Dana climbs up a crane and Aziz shoots at her with his AKMS but misses; he follows her up the crane. Harry reaches Miami and radios Faisil, who reports that the 21st floor is secure; about 12 faction members are on the 20th floor; no hostages are there; Dana is on the roof. Aziz follows Dana onto the boom of the crane. Aziz orders her to give her the key, but she swears that she will drop it. She calls him a wacko and puts the chain around her neck then screams for help. The Harrier jet comes up to the building and Harry shoots all the faction members on the 20th floor. Aziz shouts at his men to get into the helicopter and fly away. Dana slips and almost falls. Harry comes up with the Harrier and attempts to rescue Dana. Aziz shoots at the jet, causing Harry to swerve into the boom. Aziz's AKMS falls onto the jet, the strap catching on it. The men in the helicopter shoot the jet, shattering the cockpit glass, but when Harry shoots back they fly behind a building. Aziz grabs Dana's arm and she falls onto the nose of the jet. Aziz jumps down after her, landing on the wing. As Harry tries to reach Dana, Aziz pulls out a knife and climbs toward them. Harry and Aziz fight over the knife and the jet backs up into a building, missing a janitor there and throwing Aziz back and causing him to drop the knife. Harry flies the jet out of the building. As the terrorist helicopter flies nearby, Aziz recovers his AKMS. He orders Harry to take the jet down or he will kill Dana. Harry checks that Dana has a secure hold on the jet then banks it to the left, throwing Aziz off. Aziz's backpack catches on a Sidewinder missile, and he hangs by the straps. Harry sees the terrorists in the helicopter on the other side of the building, then tells Aziz, ""You're fired"".

The Santa Clause,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111070/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a man inadvertently makes Santa fall off his roof on Christmas Eve, he finds himself magically recruited to take his place. Scott Calvin is disgusted to learn that his ex-wife, Laura, and her husband, Neil, have tried and failed to break it easy to their 6-year-old son, Charlie, that Santa Claus isn't real. On Christmas Eve, Scott reads ""The Night Before Christmas"" and then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When Santa is startled by Scott's calling out and falls off, he disappears, leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does so and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group, who claim they're elves, that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of Scott's new job, though he's convinced it was a dream. Then his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, and he has a sudden love of junk food. Now he's accepted it, there's just one problem: how to keep it a secret from his disbelieving family. Scott Calvin is attending a large office party at his toy company, where he is winning an award for his salesmanship ability. As he drives home, he leaves a message for his ex-wife, Laura, apologizing for being late when she is dropping off their son Charlie, who is to spend Christmas night with him. When he arrives, he finds that Laura's new husband, Neil Miller, has explained to Charlie that there is no Santa Claus, and Laura and Scott get into an argument about it, much to Charlie's dismay.Scott's attempt to cook a nice Christmas dinner end up with him squirting a fire extinguisher at the turkey in the oven, so they go out to eat. The only place open is Denny's, where they find a full house of Japanese salesmen. The waitress leads them to the room of Men Who Burned the Turkey and tells them that they are out of eggnog, out of chocolate milk, and out of apple pie.They return home and Scott reads ""The Night Before Christmas"" to Charlie and answers a barrage of questions from him about Santa's magical abilities, explaining at the end that he does believe in Santa. Charlie goes to sleep, but is awakened by a bump on the roof. He wakes up Scott, who goes outside and sees a man in a Santa suit on the roof. He yells and the man slips and falls off the roof. Looking for identification, he finds a card instructing the finder to put on the Santa suit if anything should happen to him. They then notice a sleigh and reindeer on the roof, and the man's body disappears, leaving only the suit behind.Charlie climbs to the roof to pet the reindeer, forcing Scott to follow him. They climb into the sleigh and accidentally start the reindeer moving, eventually landing on another roof. Scott, still in his underwear, is convinced to put on the Santa suit, whereupon he is dragged out of the sleigh and down the chimney by the sack of toys. Once inside, he leaves some presents but is chased back up the chimney by a large dog. They rush off, only to end up at the next roof. This time, Scott is caught by a young girl sleeping on the couch. She tells him he is supposed to drink the milk, and he tells her sarcastically that he is lactose-intolerant.Scott eventually gets into the spirit and they spend the remainder of the night giving out presents. The reindeer then take them to the North Pole and disappear, while an elf opens a garage door for them. They are lowered into a gigantic toy workshop, where an elf named Bernard greets him as Santa. He gives Charlie a snow globe that shows Santa flying in his sleigh and sends him to get food. Bernard explains that when Scott put on the Santa suit, he fell subject to the Santa Clause. By placing the card from the suit under a magnifying glass, Scott is able to read that putting on the suit obligated him under that clause to accept the job of Santa. Bernard tells Scott that he has eleven months to get his affairs in order and that he will be shipped the List. Scott asks what would happen if he didn't believe; Bernard explains that that would result in millions of disappointed children.Scott and Charlie are then escorted by Judy the elf to Santa's bedroom. She brings Scott monogrammed pajamas (""SC"") and explains to him that children don't need to see Santa's workshop to know that it's real, and Scott and Charlie fall asleep, waking in their own bedrooms. Scott is still wearing his monogrammed pajamas. Laura arrives to pick up Charlie, who tells her the events of the evening. Laura is annoyed with Scott for encouraging Charlie to believe in Santa.Later that year, Charlie's class does a Parent's Day. He introduces Scott and explains that his job is being Santa Claus. Scott tries to explain his actual job as a toy salesman but Charlie insists that he is Santa Claus. They end up in the school counselor's office, who insists that Scott explain to Charlie that he is not Santa.Scott tries to comply, but Charlie refuses to accept it. Laura finds Charlie in his room playing Santa; Neil challenges many of Charlie's beliefs, but Charlie refutes them all; Neil tells Scott that Charlie is conflicted and they wonder if it's best to stop letting Scott see Charlie. Eventually, at Scott's request, Charlie agrees to stop discussing Santa with others.Scott wakes up one morning, much heavier and with a heavy beard. He rushes to an office meeting, wearing the only thing that will fit him, a sweatsuit. At the meeting, after a lunch where Scott orders hot fudge, extra dressing, cookies and other things, they demo an ad campaign showing Santa riding a tank. Scott objects strenuously, and suggests developing a more nurturing toy. Scott's boss orders him to get help.Scott gets heavier and heavier, with a fast-growing beard, although the doctor tells him he is as healthy as a horse. Later, watching Charlie play soccer, a little girl begins giving him her Christmas list. Laura and Neil catch Scott with children lining up to see him, intensifying their concern.The List arrives, via Federal Express, with a note from Bernard instructing Scott to check it twice. Neil and Laura take Charlie to a counsellor with the intention of revoking Scott's visitation rights. They reminisce about their own Christmas disappointments. Laura wanted a Mystery Date board game, while Neil, at just three, wanted an Oscar Meyer Weenie Whistle. Neither believed in Santa Claus ever again.Scott's visitation rights are cancelled. He goes to visit Neil and Laura anyway, and Charlie tells him that the important thing is that the kids get their presents. Charlie shows him the snow globe again, and when Scott asks for a moment alone with Charlie, Bernard appears. When Laura returns, Charlie, Scott, and Bernard have all disappeared.The police are called in, and begin arresting Santas all around the city. Meanwhile, the elves demonstrate some new, James Bond-ish technology to Scott, who is mostly worried about falling off roofs. Santa begins his rounds, including returning to the little girl who has made sure to provide soy milk for the lactose-intolerant Santa. When he returns to Neil and Laura's house, the police arrest him. Charlie is left on the roof.When the elves lose contact with Santa, they deploy the Effective Liberation Fight Squad (ELFS), a team of commandos. They pick up Charlie, then confront the desk sergeant. ""We're your worst nightmare,"" they tell him. ""Elves - with attitude."" They rip open Scott's cell door with tinsel, and return to Laura and Neil's house. Scott tells Charlie he has to stay with Laura and Neil. Neil and Laura begin to believe in Scott as Santa, and Laura burns her custody papers. As they say goodbye, Bernard appears to find out the delay. He tells Charlie that he can call back Scott by shaking the snow globe. The police return to the house just as Santa and his sleigh fly from the roof. As Scott leaves, he drops presents - a Weenie Whistle for Neil and a Mystery Date game for Laura.Ten minutes later, Charlie calls Scott back with the snow globe and they take a final quick ride around the neighborhood."

The Los Angeles Police department dispatch their Special Weapons And Tactics (S.W.A.T.) team, including hotshot Officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his partner, Officer Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels). They join their team and their boss Lieutenant Herb ""Mac"" McMahon (Joe Morton) briefs them all on the situation: bombs have already severed the main cables and the only thing keeping the elevator from dropping to the basement is the emergency brakes but the bomber has wired them with explosives and has given a one-hour ultimatum: pay him $3.7 million, or he will blow the brakes.Both Jack and Harry use building access panels to examine the bomb. Harry, the SWAT team's bomb expert, says the work doesn't look familiar but the bomber is definitely a professional. While they wait, Harry quizzes Jack: Jack is at an airport when a woman is taken hostage. The kidnapper is almost to a plane, what does Jack do? Jack suggests shooting the hostage with a non-lethal wound so the kidnapper can't take them with him. Harry scoffs, telling Jack he's crazy for the idea of shooting a civilian. Musing further about taking the hostage ""out of the equation"" Jack suddenly comes up with the idea to use a window cleaner's crane on the roof as a way to hopefully help get the passengers off the rigged car.

Payne is about to shoot Jack but has run out of ammo.He quickly shows that he has wired himself with explosives and holds Harry hostage before Jack can get a clean shot at him.

As he goes out to his car, a bus that had pulled away explodes and bursts into flames. A payphone nearby rings, and Jack is surprised to hear Payne's voice on the line. Payne explains that he had spent 2 years planning the 'elevator job,' and chastises Jack for ruining his 'life's work.' The bomber then goes on to explain that he has planted another bomb on an LA city bus, which will be armed the moment the bus passes 50 mph and then will detonate if the bus drops below that speed. Payne also explains that if any passengers are removed from the bus, he will detonate it himself, and demands a ransom of $3.7 million (the same amount he'd demanded during the elevator kidnapping) by 11 am. Furthermore, he knows that the bus' radio is out of order, so alerting the transit authority is useless. Payne gives the bus number, 2525, and Jack takes off to catch up to it.Jack manages to catch up to the bus en route, but when he frantically tries to get the bus driver to open the doors, the driver ignores him, thinking it's a prank. Jack then commandeers a Jaguar and again catches up to the bus. After a mad struggle, Jack manages to relay to the driver that there is a bomb on the bus, and manages to board, jumping from the moving car into the bus' door. Harry is also alerted by Jack through the Jaguar owner's cellular phone.Jack attempts to calm the bus passengers, but an altercation with one man wielding a gun, fearing that Jack has come to arrest him, forces a struggle and the bus driver is shot and wounded. A young woman named Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel, planning to hit the brakes. Jack sharply orders her not to stop the bus and informs the passengers about the bomb. At the suggestion of the injured driver, Jack opens an access panel in the bus floor, and finds a decoy and then the real bomb, which is alarmingly large. Relaying the info to Harry, Harry is perplexed at Jack's observation that the timer for the bomb is attached to a cheap gold watch. Harry's suspicions turn to the prospect that their mad bomber may be a former officer, and he has his staff start looking over information about officers who have worked with bombs or on bomb squads.Back on the bus, a traffic jam on the freeway forces Annie to divert the bus onto city streets instead. There, with an LAPD helicopter following the bus with Lieutenant McMahon on board trying to arrange a survivable route, the occupants of the bus have a terrifying ordeal as Annie and Jack must deal with every conceivable obstacle that threatens to fatally slow the bus as it is forced to careen through the streets. These include being forced to take a one-way lane against opposing traffic and a collision with a baby carriage that is sent flying but is mercifully only carrying empty cans.Eventually, a police escort arrives to guide the bus to the unfinished and empty 105 freeway. The first entrance, a soft right turn, is blocked by a group of school kids crossing at the worst possible time and Annie & Jack are forced to make a hard right turn that nearly spills the bus on its side. Once on the freeway, McMahon and a number of officers board a flatbed truck that pulls up next to the bus. McMahon wants to get the people off, but Jack explains that the news helicopters in the air are televising the event, and that Payne will detonate the bus if anyone gets off.Jack soon receives a call from Payne in regards to what is being seen on television. Jack manages to get Payne to agree to let the wounded bus driver off, though Payne tells Jack that 'the wildcat behind the wheel' is not to slow down. The driver is taken off successfully, however a passenger named Helen (Beth Grant) gets edgy and attempts to get off the bus. As she stands over the entrance-way stairs, Payne sets off the smaller charge and destroys the platform. Helen falls under the bus and is crushed under the wheels. During a few moments of relative calm, Annie tearfully confesses that she was profoundly relieved that the blast was not of the main bomb and she herself survived. Jack reassures Annie that is a perfectly normal human response to an extreme situation and she has nothing to regret while reminding her that the real person to blame is the bomber who put everyone in this situation in the first place.McMahon is then informed that the 105 freeway is unfinished, and a stretch of roadway ahead contains a 50 foot gap. Jack is informed of this but still refuses to take any passengers off. Desperately, Jack then instructs Annie to increase the speed, figuring there may be an incline that will allow them to jump the bus over the gap. Miraculously, his plan works, and the bus makes it to the other side intact.Once over, Jack finds an off-ramp that leads to Los Angeles International Airport. Annie takes it, and enters through an airport exit, running over a pair of spike strips that blow a few of the tires. Jack's plan is to keep the news helicopter cameras from following them. Because the airport is restricted airspace, they can't fly over it. The long runways that are not in use will also allow the bus to circle and keep it out of civilian traffic and buy time until they can find Payne or deactivate the bomb.Lieutenant McMahon soon shows up at the airport with some more cops and Jack convinces Payne to let him disembark to negotiate the ransom, which Payne agrees too. Jack reassures the passengers that he will be back shortly to help them. Jack gets off the bus onto a vehicle with Lieutenant McMahon who feels they should be able to unload the passengers safely, but Jack is still convinced that Payne will know, leaving only one option; disarm the bomb.To the passengers' alarm, Jack has arranged to put himself onto a small-wheeled dolly attached by a cable to a small truck and sent under the still-moving bus, hoping to dismantle the bomb under guidance from Harry and the Bomb Squad. However, Payne had fitted the bomb with a collapsible circuit and Jack is unable to disarm it. Harry is still thinking of alternative ways to disarm the bomb when his associates come back with Payne's identity. Payne turns out to be a former member of the Atlanta Police Department's bomb squad who was forced into early retirement when a bomb he was disarming exploded, burning his hand and costing him a thumb. Harry and his associates rush off to apprehend Howard.Jack soon comes close to death when the cable towing the dolly he's on gives way, and he is almost run over by the bus. Jack clings to the undercarriage of the bus but accidentally punctures the fuel tank with a screwdriver. The passengers on the bus help Jack up through an access panel in the bus' floor, and he survives. With leaking fuel a new problem, Jack calls for a fueling vehicle to pace the bus and refuel them.Meanwhile, Harry and some other members of the LAPD SWAT team that weren't at the airport have staked out and entered Payne's home. They soon find he is not there and that has bobby trapped the house with explosives which they triggered upon entry. The house explodes killing everyone inside, including Harry.After the bomb goes off, Payne calls Jack and gloats over Harry's death, saying it was his old watch that helped Harry identify him. Payne then gives Jack instructions to deliver the $3.7 million ransom to a garbage can at Pershing Square downtown, mentioning that everyone on the bus will die if he doesn't get his money, referring to Annie as a ""wildcat"" again. Jack has a meltdown over Harry's death and is unsure what to do next, accepting that Payne might actually win he suddenly notices the sweatshirt Annie had been wearing, which contains the logo for the University of Arizona Wildcats. Jack realizes that Payne has been monitoring the bus through the security camera above the bus driver's seat. Though the camera can record video, it cannot record audio.Jack radios over to McMahon regarding his plan. McMahon gets all the news vans nearby to stop taping and commandeers one to find the signal going into the bus camera. With everyone sitting still on the bus, the news team records them, gathering enough footage to run a video loop to fool Payne. However, Annie notes that the fuel is almost on empty, and McMahon is forced to have the tape loop with only a minute of footage having been recorded.An airport bus is brought alongside bus 2525, and the passengers are unloaded. However, the tires that had been punctured once the bus went through the airport's exits continue to lose their treads, and Annie and Jack are unable to get off. Jack affixes the steering wheel with some rope, the gas pedal with a steel pipe, and the two escape from under the bus using the access panel. The bus drives a ways off, before heading straight for an empty cargo plane. As the speed drops below 50, the bus runs into the plane and explodes.After the passengers are treated by paramedics, the police receive a call from Payne wanting to know about the money. McMahon is about to tell Payne off, but Jack realizes that Payne does not know the bus exploded, giving them the advantage to capture the madman.The money is placed in bags and dropped into the garbage container Payne had specified, with a couple of paint bombs among the cash. A number of officers (including SWAT units) patrol Pershing Square, with Payne watching from an overhead building's window. Payne thinks he's won, until he notices the bus camera, and realizes that the tape is on a loop. Payne quickly puts on his old police uniform, and blending in with the other officers, walks over to Annie, and escorts her away from the scene, saying that he'd been sent by Jack.Jack and a number of officers are watching the garbage can, but no one has appeared. Jack suddenly demands they turn on the homing beacon with the money... and all of them are surprised to see that the money is in motion. Jack rushes out to the garbage can, and finds that there is a hole below it in the pavement, leading down to a level under the street.Jack drops through the hole below street level and is confronted with Annie strapped with explosives, and Payne standing nearby, holding a detonator. Payne chastises Jack a bit before making his way to the Los Angeles subway system, with Jack jumping aboard as it pulls away, crawling across the top. Payne handcuffs Annie to a pole, and shoots and kills the train driver. Payne then explains his plan to Annie: he intends to get off the train with the money, but leave her to explode, leading the police to think they both died on the subway.Payne's overzealous nature gets the better of him, as he hears Jack climbing on top of the train car. Playfully claiming he may be able to bribe Jack into letting him go, Payne reaches into the sack of money, only to set off the hidden dye pack bomb, ruining the money and covering him in purple dye. Enraged, Payne then climbs up the side of the train car on the outside and goes hand-to-hand with Jack. As they fight, Jack notices a low-overhanging light approaching and holds Payne's head up while seizing the detonator to Annie's bomb from Payne. The light decapitates Payne, and his body falls off the car.Jack then enters the car and manages to get the explosives off Annie. However, he does not have the key to unlock her handcuffs, and when Payne shot the train driver some stray bullets hit the control panel rendering the brakes inoperable. A rail-map shows Jack that there's a sharp curve ahead. He speeds up the train with the intention of derailing it. The plan works and Annie is freed from the bar. The train barrels out of an incomplete stretch of track right in front of the Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It lands on its side and comes to a halt. None of the workers on the subway tunnel are hurt. Annie and Jack are both alive and as they kiss, a number of tourists and others whom the train has stopped traffic for, come over to look at the strange spectacle."

Timid bank clerk, Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey). Unfortunately, he's too gentle, and is unable to handle confrontations. After one of the worst days, he finds a mask which depicts Loki, the Norse god of mischief. When he puts it on, he becomes his inner, self: a cartoon wild man. After Ipkiss's alter ego indirectly kills the friend of small time crime boss, Dorian Tyrel (Peter Greene),he wants the green-faced goon destroyed.—Ian Pugh <skypilot@ezaccess.net> Bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) comes in to possession of a mysterious mask which transforms him into his inner personality. Soon, the bumbling clerk becomes an unconventional super hero in search of justice - and a good time too.—Rob Hartill Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a young shy man who works in a bank. One day, he discovers a mask by the sea, which (according to an archaeologist) pictures the Norse god of tricks and deception, Loki. When Stanley puts on the mask, he transforms into an uncontrolled reflection of himself, that does crazy things and amazes the people. This new super-hero, the ""Mask"", falls in love with a singer, Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) while he decides to eliminate every gangster in the city.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey), a clerk in an Edge City bank, is a shy, luckless romantic who is regularly bullied by nearly everyone around him, including his boss (Eamonn Roche), his landlady Mrs Peenman (Nancy Fish), and car mechanics. His only friends are his Fox Terrier Milo and his co-worker Charlie (Richard Jeni). Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) runs the exclusive Coco Bongo nightclub while plotting to overthrow his boss Niko (Orestes Matacena). Tyrell sends his singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) into Stanley's bank with a hidden camera, in preparation to rob the bank. Stanley is smitten with Tina, and she seems to reciprocate. Later that night after being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, he is stranded with a broken-down loaner car at the city's filthy harbor, where he finds a mysterious wooden mask next to a pile of garbage which at first he mistakes to be a drowning man. He takes the object home and jokingly puts it on. The mask wraps around his head, transforming him into a wackily-suited, green-headed, figure, ""The Mask"", a trickster with reality-bending powers, physical imperviousness and without personal inhibitions who exacts comical revenge on some of Stanley's tormentors and scares a street gang that attempts to mug him.The next morning, Stanley encounters world-weary Edge City detective Lieutenant Kellaway (Peter Riegert) and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt (Amy Yasbeck), both of whom are investigating the Mask's activities of the previous night. Despite these threats, the temptation to again use the mask is overwhelming and he puts it back on that evening. Needing money to attend Tina's performance at the Coco Bongo, the Mask noisily interrupts Tyrell's bank robbery and steals the targeted money while Tyrell's henchman Freeze (Reg E. Cathey) is shot by police responding to the disturbance.The Mask buys entry into the Coco Bongo, where he ""rocks the joint"" by dancing exuberantly with Tina in front of the cheering crowd after Tyrell is called away by Sweet Eddy (Denis Forest). After Freeze dies in Tyrell's arms, Tyrell violently asks who was responsible and Eddy points to the Mask dancing with Tina. At the end of the dance the Mask gives Tina a kiss that literally blows her shoes off, he is then confronted by Tyrell, who pulls out a gun and shoots off a part of the Mask's tie, which transforms back into Stanley's distinctive pajamas. The Mask escapes, while Tyrell is temporarily arrested for the bank robbery by Lt. Kellaway (who also finds the pajama scrap) who is also informed by a policeman that they found Freeze's dead body.Kellaway confronts Stanley at his apartment, just after a weary Stanley discovers all the bank money stuffed in his closet. Stanley later consults an expert on masks named Arthur Neumann (Ben Stein) who tells him that the object is likely a depiction of Loki, the Norse god of darkness and mischief. Despite this, and with both Tyrell and Lt. Kellaway hunting for him, a more confident Stanley stands up to his boss and arranges for Tina to meet the Mask at the local Landfill Park. The meeting goes badly when the Mask's advances scare Tina away and Lt. Kellaway arrives and attempts to arrest him. The Mask toys with the enraged officer before zooming out of the park and tricking a large group of Edge City police officers into joining him in a mass-performance production of the song Cuban Pete. Stanley manages to get the mask off and Peggy helps him escape, but then betrays him to Tyrell for a $50,000 mob bounty. Tyrell tries on the mask and becomes a demonic monster demanding to know from Stanley where the money he took is. Stanley is then shown in one of the mob cars as Tyrell's henchmen search Stanley's apartment and reclaim the money. Stanley is later literally dumped in Kellaway's lap with a green rubber mask and is thrown into jail.Tina sympathetically visits Stanley in his cell, where he urges her to flee the city. She attempts to do so, but is pursued by Orlando (Nils Allen Stewart) and cornered by Tyrell. Upon being told by Orlando of her attempt to leave the city, Tina is forcefully taken to his raid of a charity ball at the Coco Bongo which is hosted by Niko and attended by the city's elite including the city's mayor Mitchell Tilton (Ivory Ocean). Upon arrival, the Masked Tyrell kills Niko in a gunfight and prepares to destroy both the club and Tina. Meanwhile, Milo helps Stanley break out of his cell, and they go to the club to stop Tyrell, eventually dragging Lt. Kellaway along with him.Upon arrival, Stanley tells Lt. Kellaway to call for backup as he sneaks into the Coco Bongo with a gun of his own. After brief initial success with the assistance of Charlie, Stanley is spotted by Orlando and captured before Stanley can do anything. Tina tricks Tyrell into taking off the mask, which is recovered by Milo, turning the dog into a cartoonish pit-bull who defeats Tyrell's men, while Stanley fights Dorian himself. Stanley then recovers the mask and wears it one last time, using its abilities to save Tina by swallowing Tyrell's bomb, and then flushing Tyrell down the drain of the club's ornamental fountain. The police arrive and arrest Tyrell's remaining henchmen. Mayor Mitchell Tilton witnesses most of this (and deducing that Tyrell was the Mask from the start) and orders Lt. Kellaway to release Stanley. After Stanley, Tina, Charlie, and Milo leave, Mayor Mitchell Tilton tells Lt. Kellaway that he would like to have a word with him.As the sun rises, Stanley, Tina, Milo and Charlie take the mask back down to the harbor, where Tina and Stanley throw it back into the water and share their first kiss. Charlie attempts to retrieve the mask for himself, only to find Milo swimming away with it."
Pulp Fiction,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster and his wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption. Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) are two hit men who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his fight. The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising of a series of funny, bizarre and uncalled-for incidents.—Soumitra Faced with life's cruel irony, the unpredictable stories of a well-dressed pair of low-level hitmen; a gangster's statuesque moll, and a double-crossing prizefighter become inextricably intertwined, as the small-time crooks, Honey Bunny and Pumpkin, summon up the courage to hold up their favourite L.A. diner. Entrusted with retrieving a glow-emitting leather suitcase which belongs to their boss--the powerful crime kingpin, Marsellus--instead, the dark-suited gunmen, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, end up with a bloody mess. Fortunately--with men like Mr Wolf always around to handle a crisis--there's time to cool off in a long twist contest, while at the same time, the proud champion boxer, Butch, makes the decision of a lifetime. Soon, things will come full circle, as, once more, Jules and Vincent find themselves in the perfect dead-end situation, exactly where it all began: an all-too-familiar cafeteria. Is truth stranger than fiction?—Nick Riganas Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) are two thieves who, while dining at a coffee shop, decide that the best thing to do is to rob it. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L.

Wallace is currently dealing with Butch Collidge (Bruce Willis), a boxer who failed to throw a fight after taking Wallace's money and is now planning to flee the city, but can't leave his father's watch behind. Vincent faces some problems of his own when Wallace asks him to show his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) a good time while he's away. Some of these people redeem themselves and some don't, and all meet an end appropriate to their choices.—rmlohner Late one morning in the Hawthorne Grill, a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, a young couple, Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth), discuss the pros and cons of robbing banks versus liquor stores. Then they add restaurants to the equation, realizing they can make more by taking customers' wallets than they get out of the till. The two kiss, declare they love each other and stand up in their booth, announcing that they're robbing the diner.Earlier in the day, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) arrive at a San Fernando Valley apartment building. They are hit men in the employ of Marsellus Wallace and have come to retrieve a valuable belonging of Wallace's from a group of would-be crooks led by a young and naive guy named Brett (Frank Whaley). They take back the valuable item -- kept in a briefcase, it glows warmly and transfixes whoever looks at it. Jules recites what he claims is a Bible verse, Ezekiel 25:17, before he and Vincent execute Brett.Story #1: Vincent Vega And Marsellus Wallace's WifeAt his strip club, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) pays boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw his next fight. Jules and Vincent arrive; though it's only a few hours after their visit to the Valley, the two hit men are sporting gym clothes in place of the suits they wore earlier in the day. While Jules heads to the men's room, Vincent goes to the bar and encounters Butch. The men take an instant disliking to each other. Vincent insults Butch but before Butch can retaliate, Marsellus calls Vincent over and embraces him. Marsellus is leaving town that evening and Vincent is to take Marsellus' wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), out for dinner to keep her entertained. Rumors abound that Marsellus gravely wounded another associate, Antoine, who he believed had been improperly friendly with Mia, so Vincent is nervous. Before picking Mia up, he visits his drug dealer, Lance (Eric Stoltz), and buys some high-quality heroin. Properly sedated, he escorts the cocaine-addicted, chain-smoking Mia to Jack Rabbit Slim's, a West Hollywood 1950s-themed restaurant. After some small talk about European travel, Mia's failed acting career, foot massage, and the rumors about Antoine (which Mia dispels), Mia enters herself and Vincent in a dance contest. They dance The Twist and win a trophy. After dinner, they return to the Wallace's home. Vincent goes to the bathroom to talk himself out of making a pass at Mia. Meanwhile, she discovers the baggie of heroin in his coat pocket and, assuming it's cocaine, snorts some. She immediately passes out and begins to foam at the mouth. Panicked, Vincent takes the dying Mia to Lance's where they argue about what to do with her. Following Lance's advice, Vincent is able to revive her with a shot of adrenaline administered straight to the heart. Vincent takes Mia home. They agree not to tell Marsellus what happened since both of them would get in trouble for it.Story #2: The Gold WatchThe following night, before his fight, Butch dreams of an incident from his childhood: Back at his Tennessee home in 1973, Captain Koons (Christopher Walken) visited Butch to bring him a gold watch. The watch had belonged to Butch's great-grandfather, who took it to World War I with him. Butch's grandfather had taken it to World War II, and Butch's father to Vietnam. Butch's father died as a POW, but gave the watch to Koons to return to Butch. Koons says that he and Butch's father had to hide the watch in their rectums to keep it away from their captors. Butch reaches up with his hand and takes the watch from Koons.Butch wakes from the dream. Instead of throwing the match (offscreen), he fights so viciously that he kills his opponent. He took Marsellus' money and bet it on himself; his winnings will amount to a small fortune. Butch makes small talk with Esmarelda (Angela Jones), the driver of the cab he is in, who reveals that she knows he's the boxer who killed his opponent; she seems fascinated with the topic of death. Esmarelda drives Butch to the seedy motel where he and his French girlfriend, Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros), are staying, having abandoned their apartment. In the morning they will travel to Butch's hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, claim their winnings, and leave the country. While packing the next morning, however, Fabienne reveals that she forgot the gold watch, the belonging Butch cherishes above all others. After a savage outburst in which he wrecks the motel room's television, Butch takes Fabienne's car to get the watch, parking a few blocks away and walking through a vacant lot to his apartment building as a precaution. He enters without incident and finds his wristwatch in the bedroom. He realizes he's not alone in the apartment when he notices a sub-machine gun in the kitchen. Catching Vincent off guard as he emerges from the bathroom, Butch kills him with the gun he found. He leaves his apartment after wiping the gun down with a tissue to remove his fingerprints.Leaving the apartment with his watch, Butch encounters Marsellus crossing the street. He tries to run Marsellus over with his car but only wounds him and is hit by another car himself. Both are injured and Marsellus chases Butch into a pawn shop. There, the owner, Maynard (Duane Whitaker), overpowers them. Marsellus and Butch wake up in the basement of the pawn shop, bound and gagged. Maynard has called his cousin Zed (Peter Greene), who works as a security guard. Maynard and Zed are apparently a pair of redneck serial killers who kill passersby who happen into their store. While the Gimp (Stephen Hibbert), a huge man-child dressed head to toe in black leather fetish gear, watches Butch, Maynard and Zed take Marsellus into the next room and begin to rape him. Butch manages to break the ropes and chair holding him and knocks out the Gimp. Ready to leave the pawn shop and Marsellus to his fate, Butch has an attack of conscience and procures a samurai sword and rescues Marsellus; in the process, Maynard is killed and Zed emasculated by a shotgun blast fired by Marsellus. Marsellus stays behind to oversee the torture-execution of Zed (""I'ma get medieval on your ass,"" he tells him), but promises that as long as Butch never mentions what happened and never returns to Los Angeles, Marsellus will forget that Butch betrayed him in the boxing ring. Butch agrees. In the final scene, Butch and Fabienne leave town on Grace, Zed's chopper-style motorcycle.Story #3: The Bonnie SituationThree days earlier, flashing back in time to just after Vincent and Jules finish killing Brett for stealing Marsellus' prized possession, a gang member (Alexis Arquette) they had not known about bursts out of the bathroom where he had apparently been when Jules and Vincent entered and empties a large pistol point blank at them. However, all of the bullets miss Vincent and Jules, hitting the wall behind them, so they return fire and kill the gang member. Jules is certain what occurred was divine intervention, but Vincent dismisses the idea. They leave with Marvin (Phil LaMarr), Marsellus' inside man in the gang. In the car, Jules continues his insistence that what happened in the apartment was a miracle and that he's retiring from Marsellus' gang. Vincent leans over the front seat, asking Marvin if he believes in miracles, but accidentally shoots him in the head and kills him. The inside of the car is now covered in blood and brain matter. Jules, furious at Vincent's klutziness, drives to the house of his only friend in the Valley, a former colleague named Jimmie (Quentin Tarantino). Jimmie lets them hide the car in his garage but angrily tells them that they have to get rid of the body within an hour -- before his wife Bonnie comes home from her night shift at a hospital. Jules calls Marsellus at his home to explain their predicament. Marsellus then calls Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel), a suave and professional ""cleaner"" who solves problems. Wolf arrives at Jimmie's house and tells Vincent and Jules how to clean up the car and themselves -- they have to strip out of their business suits, be sprayed down with a garden hose and wear Jimmie's spare T-shirts and shorts (which explains their attire at the strip club) -- then helps them dispose of the car and body at a junkyard belonging to a discreet friend named Monster Joe, whose daughter is Mr. Wolf's girlfriend.With the whole situation resolved, Jules and Vincent decide to have breakfast at the Hawthorne Grill, where they continue their discussion about miracles. Jules reveals his plan to leave his criminal life and travel the globe as a mendicant, helping those suffering under tyranny. Vincent, upset that his friend and partner is leaving the life, mocks him, then goes to the bathroom. Just then Honey Bunny and Pumpkin (from the prologue) begin their robbery of the diner. They furiously collect the cash from the register and the patrons' wallets. Jules gives Pumpkin his wallet, but when Pumpkin tries to take Marsellus' briefcase, Jules pulls his gun and disarms Pumpkin. While Vincent holds Honey Bunny at bay, Jules explains to Pumpkin how, even earlier that morning, he would have killed Pumpkin and Honey Bunny without a second thought. He recites his ersatz version of Ezekiel 25:17 again: ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.""Jules explains that while he previously thought it was cool to make such a cold-blooded passage the last thing his victims heard, he now realizes that the ""tyranny of evil men"" part of the passage refers to him, and he intends to become a better person. He and Vincent allow Honey Bunny and Pumpkin to leave with all the money but not the briefcase. They leave the diner themselves and head to Marsellus' strip club."

Against the backdrop of a gloomy San Francisco, the nearly two-century-old vampire, Louis de Pointe du Lac, recounts the unbelievable story of his eternal transformation and a life worse than death to the sceptic reporter, Daniel Molloy. Spanning two hundred years of cruel betrayals, extreme solitude, and unquenched thirst, Louis' grimly fascinating tale pivots around his perpetually regrettable decision to embrace the dictatorship of blood, and, above all, his maker: the seductive blonde aristocrat of death, Lestat de Lioncourt. Is Louis' mystical epic of bloodshed genuine? Is this, indeed, an interview with a vampire?—Nick Riganas It hasn't even been a year since a plantation owner named Louis lost his wife in childbirth. Both his wife and the infant died, and now he has lost his will to live. A vampire named Lestat takes a liking to Louis and offers him the chance to become a creature of the night: a vampire. Louis accepts, and Lestat drains Louis' mortal blood and then replaces it with his own, turning Louis into a vampire.

Louis' skin is translucent and he oozes charm.Louis begins his story in 1791 where he is a young plantation owner living on his estate in Louisiana. Having lost the will to live due to the deaths of his wife and infant child in childbirth, he squanders his wealth and gambles in shady bars, welcoming death. While wandering the waterfront, drunk and in company of a harlot, he is attacked by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise). The woman is killed and Louis is fed on, but allowed to live. Lestat has sensed Louis' dissent for life and returns to him to offer him a new one, giving him ""the choice I never had"". Louis meets Lestat in a cemetery where the vampire drains him to the point of death before offering him his own blood. Doing so transforms Louis into a newborn vampire and he is amazed at the change.However, he quickly comes to regret his decision and finds feasting on humans immoral whereas Lestat revels in the pleasure of killing. As such, Louis begins to suffer and survives by feasting on rats and other small animals. Lestat lives with Louis at his plantation and the slaves begin to grow anxious by his presence. At a party, Lestat convinces Louis to seduce a wealthy but older heiress (Lyla Hay Owen) in order to drink her blood. While Lestat feasts on her powdered servant, (Lee E. Scharfstein), Louis attempts to feed but goes for the woman's irate poodles instead. Hearing the commotion and the woman's terrified cries, Lestat rushes over and snaps her neck and berates Louis.In the interview, Molloy asks about vampire stereotypes; coffins, crucifixes, garlic, and stakes through the heart. Louis admits that most are nonsense, except coffins. Secure and comfortable, they are one of the only sensible things a vampire can rest in with no fear of the light.During an evening at home, Louis has a rare moment alone with his servant, Yvette (Thandiwe Newton), who confides that she and the other slaves are concerned about their master and how he never eats or comes out during the day anymore. She comforts Louis but he takes her wrist and feeds from her. She screams and Louis suddenly has to stifle her. The other slaves, having grown suspicious of him over time, approach the mansion with torches to see Louis carrying Yvette's body out. Louis grabs one of the torches, tells the slaves their master is damned and that they should leave, and sets the mansion on fire. Lestat arrives and scolds Louis who seems bent on punishing himself for his sins. Lestat takes them to a mausoleum where they can sleep safely during the day.Eventually they find a new dwelling in New Orleans but Louis remains despondent, refusing to feed on humans even when Lestat has them offered on a silver platter. In one instance Lestat brings home two prostitutes (Indra OvéandHelen McCrory) and toys with them before killing them, trying to entice Louis to give in to his nature; to end his suffering. Lestat's philosophy is one of pleasure out of necessity; they must feed, so why not have fun? He tries to persuade Louis to end his suffering, to no avail. Louis wanders the streets one night and stumbles on a sector infested with the plague. He discovers a little girl (Kirsten Dunst) weeping at the decomposing body of her mother. She runs to Louis for comfort but he is suddenly overcome with hunger and feeds from her. Lestat appears, laughing and celebrating Louis' break from abstinence by dancing with the girl's dead mother. Louis flees but laments that he finally felt what peace could be; by allowing himself to be a vampire.He returns to the home he shares with Lestat to find that he's brought the little girl back with him, alive. Appealing to Louis' compassion, and to convince him to stay with him, Lestat turns the girl, making her a vampire, and names her Claudia. Louis resents Lestat for this, but comes to love Claudia as his own daughter. He and Lestat dote on her and shower her with luxurious clothes and dolls and Claudia grows into a talented killer, using her child-like charms to lure her victims. Lestat is proud of his apt pupil but, though time passes, Claudia remains a little girl immortal. When she finally realizes she can never grow old and look as other women do, she becomes furious. She demands that Louis tell her how she came to be and, after hearing the story, blames Lestat for her condition. She tells Louis that it's time for them to leave Lestat and devises a plan since Lestat would never let them go. On the basis of a truce, she fools Lestat into drinking 'dead blood' from two boys she overdosed with laudanum. Having fed from the dead, Lestat is incapacitated and Claudia slits his throat. She and Louis take Lestat into the bayou and dump his body in alligator infested waters.They return home to pack, intent on leaving for Europe to start a new life, but Lestat returns, decrepit but alive, having fed on alligators and other animals in the swamp. He attacks Claudia for having been ""a very naughty little girl"" but Louis sets him and their home on fire. Louis and Claudia flee and make it to their ship in time to see the whole neighborhood aflame. They travel through the Mediterranean and across Europe seeking other vampires but never finding any. Eventually, they settle in Paris and, one night, Louis encounters a vampire named Santiago (Stephen Rea) who taunts him before meeting Armand (Antonio Banderas), a seductive vampire who theorizes that, after 400 years, he must be the oldest vampire in the world. Armand invites Louis and Claudia to live with him at his coven, the Thèâtre de Vampires where vampires pretending to be humans pretending to be vampires stage horror shows for humans, though they actually feast on unsuspecting patrons. Claudia is disgusted by their cheap theatrics but Louis is drawn to Armand by his charm and wisdom.Santiago is able to read Louis' mind and suspects that he and Claudia murdered their companion, Lestat, of whom they knew - a taboo among vampires. Claudia is a taboo herself in that no vampire should create an undead child. With this knowledge, Armand tries to get Louis to leave Claudia to live with him. Louis is tempted, yearning to learn what he could not from Lestat. Sensing that he is leaving, Claudia demands that Louis leave her a companion and brings a woman named Madeleine (Domiziana Giordano) to their home. Madeleine has agreed to change for Claudia so that she can 'adopt' her. Louis reluctantly concedes. However, as soon as Madeleine completes her transformation, the Parisian vampires invade the home and abduct the three of them. They encase Louis in a metal coffin and trap Claudia and Madeleine in a well, open to the sky above. At dawn, Madeleine and Claudia are burned to death by the sun before Louis, freed by Armand, can get to them. Enraged and grieving over his loss of Claudia, Louis sets the coven on fire, killing most of the vampires. He escapes with Armand who, again, offers him a place by his side. Louis refuses.Decades pass and Louis wanders the world dejected and alone before eventually returning to the United States and returns to New Orleans. One evening he finds himself visiting his old plantation and mansion, neglected and in ruin. There he discovers Lestat living alone, a shadow of his former self who cringes at car headlights and hasn't adapted to the new world. Louis pities Lestat and leaves him.This concludes the interview with Molloy but, to Louis' disdain, Daniel only sees the potential power in being a vampire and requests that Louis turn him. Louis retorts that his life is nothing but suffering and, angered, leaves the apartment in a flurry. Daniel leaves the apartment, frightened by Louis' rage and drives off, playing a cassette from the interview. Moments later, Lestat appears like a bat out of hell and bites Molloy. Having gained some strength, he puts Molloy in the passenger seat and drives the car himself across the Golden Gate Bridge. He turns off the cassette tape, moaning over Louis' constant complaining and offers Molloy a choice; the choice he never had."
Maverick,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110478/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Bret Maverick, needing money for a poker tournament, faces various comic mishaps and challenges, including a charming woman thief. Maverick is recreated from the character James Garner created in the 1950s TV program. Maverick is a gambler who would rather con someone than fight them. He needs an additional three thousand dollars in order to enter a Winner Take All poker game that begins in a few days. He tries to win some, tries to collect a few debts, and recover a little loot for the reward, all with a light hearted air. He joins forces with a woman gambler with a marvelous, though fake, southern accent as the two both try and enter the game.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Bret Maverick is a superb professional poker gambler, as handy with the handgun as he handles the cards, but also a master at avoiding violence by deception. Like all great poker layers, he's on his way to a winner take all championship on Commodore Duvall's riverboat, but first must complete the steep entry sum, collecting debts and gambling. He has most confusing encounters with other gamblers, mainly fake 'Southern belle' Annabelle Bransford and Marshal Zane Cooper, tricksters in his league, and various other stooges and accomplices, such as the bandit Angel and his gang, the Indian Joseph who preys on tourists and one of them, a Russian Archduke. Things are rarely what they seem, as layers of shameless deception are unfolded.—KGF Vissers Gambler Bret Maverick is on his way to a poker tournament wherein half million dollars is at stake. At he needs is $25,000 and he has so far 22. So he goes around trying to collect from people who owe him but it appears they all try to get out of paying him. And he plays poker hoping to come up with the money. Along the way he crosses paths with a man named Angel whom he out plays which makes him dislike Maverick and a woman named Annabelle who is a con woman. So as he continues to go to the tournament and tries to get the rest of the money he needs. Angel's asked by someone to keep Maverick from getting to the tournament and he tries. But Maverick is just too lucky.—rcs0411@yahoo.com A cowboy does everything that he can to enter a poker tournament that is played on a cruise ship. Once he enters, his opponents do everything that they can to get rid of him. The cowboy competes the best that he can to win the massive money prize.—RECB3 The story, set in the American Old West, is a first-person account by a wisecracking gambler 'Bret Maverick' (Mel Gibson), of his misadventures on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. Besides wanting to win the poker championship for the money, he also wants to prove, once and for all, that he is 'the best'. However, complications keep getting in the way.Maverick rides into the fictional town of Crystal River intending to collect money owed to him, as he is $3000 short of the poker tournament entry fee of $25,000. His efforts to make up this $3000 provide some plot motivation, as well as diversions caused by, and in the company of, three people he encounters at Crystal River-an antagonist named Angel (Alfred Molina), a young con-artist calling herself Mrs Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), and legendary lawman Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner, who played Bret Maverick in the original TV series). The first two are also rival poker players.Maverick, Bransford and Cooper share a stagecoach (the driver of which dies at the reins at full gallop), agree to help a wagon train of migrant evangelist settlers who have been waylaid by ruffians (for a fee which Maverick in the end is too big-hearted to accept) and are headed-off by a troop of Indians led by ""Joseph"" (Graham Greene). Unknown to his companions, Joseph and Maverick are good friends, and Maverick allows himself to be ""captured."" Joseph is another one of his unreliable debtors, and in and around his tribal grounds they collaborate on a scheme to swindle a Russian Grand Duke.During this time, Angel has received a mysterious telegram ordering him to not allow Maverick to reach the poker game, and has also learned that Maverick had conned him in Crystal River. These scenes are some of the very few which do not involve Maverick directly. Angel catches up with Maverick after he has left Joseph's tribe, beats him up and attempts to hang him. Despite being tied to both a tree and to his horse, Maverick escapes and reaches the poker game-on a paddle steamer-safely. Bransford and Angel have also reached the game, and Cooper who is engaged to ensure the security of the game.After preliminary rounds, the four finalists are Maverick, Bransford, Angel, and the Commodore of the boat (James Coburn). Maverick almost fails to reach the final table by the 5:00am deadline, having had his stateroom door chained (by an unknown person) after a short tryst with Bransford. The game proceeds, with Bransford the first eliminated, and shortly thereafter a ""fixed"" hand is dealt to the three remaining players. The Commodore is given four 8s and Angel is given a low straight flush, whilst Maverick has the 10, Jack, Queen and King of Spades. The Commodore and Angel each bet ""all in"" (inferring that Maverick is the chip leader at this stage). Maverick observes the dealer bottom-dealing to the others, protests the conduct of the hand, and eventually accepts one card dealt by Angel and calls the bets without checking the card. It is, melodramatically, the Ace of Spades (Note that a 9 of Spades would also have won the hand for Maverick). An enraged Angel draws his gun but he, and his stooges in the audience, are gunned down in rapid succession by Cooper and Maverick (drawing one of Cooper's guns).Three plot twists follow Maverick's win: Firstly, Cooper steals the $500,000 prize money instead of presenting it to Maverick. Secondly, it is revealed that the Commodore and Cooper were secretly in cahoots on the theft and that Angel had actually been working for the Commodore. Thirdly, Maverick ambushes the two around a campfire and steals back the money. He leaves them with a single gun to settle their affairs. Cooper beats up the Commodore and angrily vows to wreak bloody vengeance on Maverick, even if it means hunting him to the ends of the earth.Later, Maverick is relaxing in a bath-house when Cooper finds him, and drops the facade to reveal (to the audience) that he is in fact Maverick's father. It is also revealed that the real conspiracy was between the two of them. Suddenly, however, Bransford enters the bath-house and robs Cooper and Maverick (whose relationship she had easily surmised). However, she only gets away with half of the money she had expected, as Maverick had hidden the rest in his boots. Maverick smiles and comments that it will be a lot of fun getting the rest of the money back from her."

But because the Senator's body is missing, they can't prosecute him. Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) thinks the lawyer told Mark where the body is which is why he wants to speak to him.

Mark is found at the scene, and both the FBI and the Mafia quickly realize that Mark probably knows more than he says. Mark decides he needs a lawyer, and goes looking for one. He finds Reggie Love, who also becomes convinced that Mark knows more than he says, but Mark isn't talking...—Liz Jordan <c9310494@alinga.newcastle.edu.au> Mark Sway (Brad Renfro), his mother (Mary-Louise Parker), and his younger brother (David Speck) live in a small trailer in Memphis, Tennessee. Mark, a young, street-smart kid, distracts his mother and steals two cigarettes from her purse while she rushes to get ready for her blue-collar job. After she leaves, Mark and Ricky play in the woods and Mark teaches Ricky to smoke. When they hear a car coming, they panic. They throw the cigarettes down and hide behind some bushes.A big man gets out of the car, runs a hose from the tailpipe into the window, and gets back in the car. Mark figures out he's trying to kill himself, tells his terrified brother to stay put. Mark pulls the hose from the tailpipe. When the man realizes that something is wrong, he gets out and replaces the hose in the tailpipe. Mark tries to remove it again but the drunk man catches him, hits him and throws him in his car.The man tells Mark that since he's so nosy, they should die together. The man says he is Jerome Clifford, Attorney at Law. But he says that since they're both pretty tight to just call him ""Romy."" As he's talking, Mark notices a gun lying between them. Mark asks Jerome why hes trying to kill himself. He responds that if he doesn't kill himself, his client Barry 'The Blade' Muldano will because Jerome knows where the body of Boyd Boyett, a man The Blade killed, is buried. He tells Mark where it is, but we can't hear what he says. He says the body is still there and no one will ever find it. Mark suddenly picks up the gun and points it at Jerome. Jerome encourages Mark to pull the trigger, but Jerome can't do it. Jerome takes the gun away and says ""let's see if it works."" He shoots the gun near Mark's head and Mark escapes from the car. He takes Ricky and runs as Jerome chases after them, yelling, ""If The Blade finds out what you know, he's going to kill you anyway."" He stops, puts the gun in his mouth, and pulls the trigger. Ricky sees the entire act and is severely traumatized. Mark takes Ricky home and returns to the scene.Mark watches from hiding while the police remove Jerome's body away but they discover him. Sergeant Hardy (Will Patton) brings Mark home where his mother is trying to get Ricky to respond, but Ricky won't talk. She asks Mark what happened. Mark says he and Ricky discovered Jerome dead with the gun in his mouth and that Ricky hasn't talked since. Sergeant Hardy returns and takes Mark to the hospital, asking him questions on the way. He asks Mark if he is telling the truth, and then asks him if the name Jerome Clifford means anything to him. Mark says no. The officer says that he found two cigarettes near the scene, the same brand his mother smokes. Mark tells the officer that he was walking through the woods when he found Romy dead. Hardy asks who Romy is. He says the only name he used was Jerome Clifford.We then see a Reverend Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) watching the story on the news. Roy also happens to be the D.A. in the case for Senator Boyd Boyett's murder and is running for governor. Without Boyd Boyett's body and Jerome dead, Mr. Foltrigg has no case. Back at the hospital, Sergeant Hardy gives Mark a Sprite. He says he thinks Mark is lying and that Mark was in Jerome's car. He even teases him for being so poor and tries to scare him by saying if he doesn't tell the truth, Ricky could end up in a dumpy institution with snakes and bugs. A nurse interrupts and takes Mark to Ricky's room. The doctor says Ricky has post traumatic stress disorder and is in a coma. As he continues to talk, Mark sees Sergeant Hardy putting Mark's Sprite can in a plastic bag. Mark runs after him, but the officer is already in the elevator, smirking. Mark wanders into a waiting room, where he finds a flier for a law firm on the ground.Back with Roy Foltrigg, his people are telling him Mark's story and they don't believe it because they found Mark's fingerprints all over the car. Roy deduces that Jerome must have told Mark where the body is and that's why he's lying. He demands to speak with Mark right away. Mark goes to the law firm in his flier and finds lawyer Regina ""Reggie"" Love (Susan Sarandon). Hes reluctant to have her represent him before he has to talk with the FBI and Mr. Foltrigg because shes a woman, but shes interested in his case because she has a grudge against Roy. He says he doesn't know why hes being harassed just because he saw some sweaty, fat guy commit suicide. Reggie asks why he lied to the police and told them he just found Jerome. He says he didn't lie and Reggie tells him that dead men don't sweat. He admits that he did see Jerome alive before he killed himself, but doesn't tell her he talked to him. Reggie agrees to take his case and Mark pays her a dollar.Meanwhile in New Orleans, The Blade is getting scolded by his boss, Uncle Johnny for telling Jerome too much and says the kids might know too much now as well. So he tells The Blade to move the body just in case. Not able to trust Barry, Uncle Johnny sends another hit man, Rocky, to ""take care of"" the kids. Back with Mark, Roy and his people are interrogating Mark. He asks if he needs a lawyer before talking to him and they tell him no. He gives them the run around until Roy flat out asks him about the body, and to that Mark demands to go the bathroom. Eventually, Reggie returns, accusing them of unlawful interrogation, which they deny, but Reggie plays a tape of their conversation, catching them all in a lie. Roy insists that he has proof Mark is lying and was in the car with Jerome, but Reggie accuses him of hypocrisy.When Reggie leaves, she begins speaking with Mark's mother, who begins telling Reggie about her dreams and how all she ever wanted was a white house and walk-in closet. Later, Reggie is trying to get the truth out of Mark. But Mark insists he was not in Jerome's car. Reggie eventually leaves Mark in the waiting room, where a man hired by Rocky to get close to Mark gives him candy and begins to talk with him, prying for information. Mark notices something isn't right and leaves. Late that night, Mark goes to get something to eat, but is held at knife point by Rocky in the elevator. Rocky threatens Mark not to talk to the FBI or he'll be killed. The next day, Mark goes to Reggie and refuses to talk to the FBI. Before Reggie can say much she's notified that Roy and the FBI are on their way. Mark hides while Reggie talks to them. They have proof that Mark's story is not true. This flusters Reggie but she manages to stay calm by pointing out that they illegally obtained evidence and she'll expose Mr. Foltrigg if they go near Mark again. His illegal actions wouldn't look good for a man running for governor of Louisiana. Mr. Foltrigg reveals that Reggie was once in rehab; this shocks Mark. Reggie manages to get rid of them and, infuriated, confronts Mark about his lies. Mark accuses her of being the liar, fires her, and storms out. She follows him and he jumps in her car upon seeing the media circus outside of the hospital.Reggie goes to her house, but Mark demands to be taken back the hospital. Reggie refuses to take him anywhere until he tells her the truth. He declines and tries, in vain, to hitchhike. A car drives up, but Mark sees that it's the man he didn't feel right about in the waiting room. Afraid, he runs to Reggie's house. He's angry at first, but Reggie gets him to talk to her. Mark reveals that his father used to get drunk and beat him and his mother, which is why he was so mad when he found out about Reggie's past. Reggie begins talking about her children and ex-husband until Mark feels comfortable enough to tell her the whole truth, including Rocky's threat. Reggie, alarmed, begins to call to get Mark someplace safe. Outside, Rocky and two other hit men talk about going in, killing Reggie and kidnapping Mark. One of them has an idea and they burn Mark's trailer as a warning instead. Mark's mother hears the news at the hospital and, having lost her job as well, is devastated. She yells at Reggie and tells her Mark already has a mother and kicks her out of the room. After Reggie leaves the police come to take Mark into custody until he talks to the FBI. In custody, Mark asks for a phone to call his mother, and prank orders pizzas to the police department. Meanwhile Reggie is trying to get Mark out. She talks to a friend of hers about getting Mark to talk only if he and his family can get into the Witness Protection Program afterwards. She's frustrated when they cant guarantee it to her, but gets Mark out to talk anyway. Mark says whatever he does he could get killed anyway and she can't let them ask any questions. She cant promise him anything but says he can't lie if they do get him on the stand.In court, Roy and the FBI browbeat Mark to talk but Reggie diverts them any way she can. Eventually they get Mark on the stand and struggle to get information, but he eventually pleads the Fifth and decides he'd rather go back to jail until everything is sorted out than risk his family's life. Meanwhile The Blade is meeting with Uncle Johnny and they decide Mark has gotten too close to talking and he must be killed. Back at the jail, Mark is found on the ground, barely conscious, soaked in sweat, and heart beating extremely rapidly. They rush him to the hospital where he escapes from his gurney, only to find that Rocky has followed him there. A chase between Mark and Rocky ensues, but Mark manages to get away. He calls Reggie's home and tells her he faked a post traumatic stress attack in order to escape from jail. Reggie says she's coming to pick him up.Reggie manages to sneak Mark in her car and Mark says he's thinking about Witness Protection now. But Jerome was drunk so the body may not be where he said. Reggie says they have to know where the body is before Mark gets any protection. Mark convinces Reggie they have to go to New Orleans and make sure the body is where Romy said it was, under Romy's own boat in Romy's boat house. Reggie is very reluctant, but agrees. Meanwhile, The Blade is asking Uncle Johnny once again for permission to move the body now that Mark has escaped. Uncle Johnny agrees but says this is The Blade's last chance. Reggie calls her brother from a hotel in New Orleans to tell him what shes up to, unaware that Mr. Foltrigg is tracking her call. They go after her.Later, Reggie and Mark find Romy's boat house which is located next to some rather paranoid and security-ridden neighbors. Mark manages to crawl through a high window into the boat house, leaving Reggie behind at the bottom. Little do they know that The Blade and Rocky have arrived at the same place. The hit men make their way into the boat house, while Mark hurriedly hides in Romy's covered boat. To get the body, the men raise the boat up. Reggie, scared for Mark climbs quietly to the open window to see if he's okay. Mark looks down from under the cover while the men uncover the body. Reggie gets Mark's attention and begs him to sneak back out through the window. After a while, he sees the body and finally tries to climb up to the window where Reggie pulls him through. They make a noise, which The Blade hears, and when he looks up he sees Reggie and Mark looking trying to escape. They run and The Blade goes after them. He eventually catches Reggie and his gun goes flying in the struggle. Reggie tells Mark to run, but Mark picks up the gun and tells The Blade to let Reggie go. He holds The Blade at gunpoint, seriously considering shooting him, but Reggie convinces Mark to hand the gun over to her. The Blade teases Reggie saying she doesn't have the guts and should have let Mark shoot. Reggie scoffs and instead shoots a security box on the neighbor's house, setting off alarms. The neighbors come out making a fuss, and Mark and Reggie get away while the neighbors shoot at The Blade and the other hit men. The hit men shoot back at the neighbors, who retreat. And the hit men leave before the police can arrive. Mark goes back to the boat house to find the garbage bag that's supposed to contain Boyd Boyett's body. He opens it to see if he's in there, and is assaulted with the sight of maggots, an awful smell, and the body.The next day, Reggie meets with Roy in a New Orleans diner. Roy is anxious to find out the whereabouts of the body, but Reggie will only tell him if he meets the conditions she wants of Mark and his family's Witness Protection Program first. She tells him she wants Mark's mother to have some starting-out money to have a nice little house, white, with a walk-in closet.Back with the hit men, Uncle Johnny makes it clear that the Blade is to be killed for screwing up his last chance so royally. Finally, back with the Sways, Ricky is airlifted to another hospital in a different location while Mark decides he wants them to be relocated to Phoenix. His mother agrees. She signs the papers and they start to get on the plane, until Mark sees Reggie again. He asks if she can come with them, but she says when entering Witness Protection he has to sever all ties with anyone back home. Mark will never see Reggie again. He gives her a hug and tells her he loves her, and she tells him the same. But before Mark gets on the plane, he turns to Reggie, smiles and says, ""I'll call you."" Reggie can do nothing but laugh.Immediately after the Sways take off, the FBI surround Reggie and she exasperatedly tells them where the body is. Roy, smiling, reminds Reggie that she should have included immunity from her illegal actions, but Reggie produces the tape of HIS illegal actions. They both silently agree to keep quiet. After Roy leaves, Reggie sees Mark's plane disappearing as he and his family leave Louisiana forever, safely."
Disclosure,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109635/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A computer specialist is sued for sexual harassment by a former lover turned boss who initiated the act forcefully, which threatens both his career and his personal life. Tom Sanders is a manager at a computer company in Seattle. Happily married with children, Tom had big hopes for a promotion by his boss, but it goes to Meredith Johnson, Tom's seductive ex-girlfriend, instead. Somehow Tom takes it with a grain of salt, until a personal meeting turns into a seduction when Meredith decides to relive her sexual fantasy and pick up from where they left off. Tom refuses, making Meredith frustrated. Tom's only choice; to sue for sexual harassment. But everyone believes it was the other way around and his boss wants to transfer him to another division, forcing him to lose everything. Tom discovers not only is the system rigged against him, but Meredith's going to destroy his career, and bolster her own by blaming him for a serious error of judgment on her part.—Christopher Howell (Ckh87520@aol.com) Seattle technology company DigiCom is about to merge with a publishing company, and company founder and president Bob Garvin (Donald Sutherland) plans to retire. Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas), head of manufacturing, expects to be promoted to run DigiCom after the merger. However, he learns that the post instead has gone to operations executive Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore), a former girlfriend. Garvin introduces Meredith to her new subordinates. Co-workers like Mark Lewyn (Dennis Miller) comment to Tom on how attractive Meredith is. Others like chief financial officer Stephanie Kaplan (Rosemary Forsyth) seem to be aware that Tom and Meredith had a relationship in the past.Late that evening, Meredith calls Tom into her office, ostensibly to discuss problems with DigiCom's new advanced CD-ROM drive, being manufactured in Malaysia. Instead, Meredith aggressively tries to resume her romantic relationship with him. Tom resists (with difficulty) as he is now a married family man. Although he repeatedly turns her down, Meredith ignores Tom, forcing herself on him. Tom initially is tempted, but after catching a glimpse of himself in a mirror, he regains control and pushes Meredith to the ground. As he leaves, Meredith screams a threat to make him pay for spurning her.The next day, Tom discovers that Meredith has alleged sexual harassment against him to DigiCom. Colleagues refuse to believe his protestations of innocence and the company pressures him to accept reassignment to the company's Austin office. Tom does not want to do this, as he would lose his stock options, ruining his career and family. However, since no one believes his story and Meredith is now his boss, he appears to have no choice.Just as all seems hopeless, Tom receives an e-mail from someone identified only as ""A Friend"". It directs him to Seattle attorney Catherine Alvarez (Roma Maffia), who specializes in sexual harassment cases. Tom counter-sues, alleging that Meredith is the one who harassed him. Evidence is produced that supports Tom's story and refutes Meredith's testimony before a court mediator.
The company backs down and reinstates him with a large pay raise. Tom is celebrating his apparent victory, but then receives another e-mail from ""A Friend"" warning him that all is not what it seems.It turns out that Meredith and Garvin's assistant, Philip Blackburn (Dylan Baker), had weakened the quality control specifications at the Malaysian plant to cut costs. The changes resulted in severe defects in the drive, and Meredith and Phil are planning to make Tom the scapegoat. At a conference the next day announcing the merger, they will make Tom look incompetent, thereby giving them a valid reason to fire him.Tom is unable to access the company computer to seek confirmation because Meredith has locked him out of the system. He spends a tense and frantic night before getting the information through a Virtual Reality demonstration machine left in the hotel room of executives from the merging company, with help from a colleague who owes him a favor. Armed with the incriminating memos, he manages to again turn the tables on Meredith, exposing her involvement and getting her fired instead. As she is escorted out, she shrilly proclaims that Tom is actually to blame and that the evidence is a last-ditch effort of revenge for trying to fire him.Tom thinks this puts him back in the running to helm DigiCom, but Garvin instead names Stephanie Kaplan as his successor. Faced with the inevitable, Tom heartily approves. It occurs to him that her son Spencer, a research assistant to professor Arthur Friend, currently away in Nepal, could very well be the ""friend"" responsible for helping him via e-mail. Spencer gives him a knowing look.
In the end, Tom is left in the same position he was in at the beginning of the film, but only after a very narrow escape. He is left musing over the fact that two women (his attorney and his new boss) were responsible for saving him."

In the late twenty-third century, the gala maiden voyage of the newly-christened U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-B boasts such luminaries as Pavel Chekov, Montgomery Scott, and the legendary Captain James T. Kirk as guests. But her maiden voyage turns into a disaster as the unprepared starship is forced to rescue two transport ships from a mysterious energy ribbon. The Enterprise manages to save a handful of the ships' passengers and barely succeeds out intact, but at the cost of Captain Kirk's life. Seventy-eight years later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D crew find themselves at odds with renegade scientist Dr. Tolian Soran, who is destroying entire star systems. Only one man can help Picard stop Soran's scheme, and he has been dead for seventy-eight years.—Gregory A. Sheets <m-sheets2@onu.edu> In the late twenty-third century, retired Starfleet officers James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott, and Pavel Chekov are guests of honor aboard the newly-christened U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-B. However, her maiden voyage takes an unexpected turn when the starship encounters two vessels trapped inside the Nexus, a mysterious energy ribbon. During a perilous rescue attempt, Kirk sacrifices himself in a heroic attempt to save the lives of the ships' passengers. Seventy-eight years later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D crew encounter Dr. Tolian Soran, a renegade scientist with a deadly plan to harness the power of the Nexus at the cost of millions of innocent lives. Picard's only hope for the future now rests within the Nexus, and a legendary Captain from the past.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> In the year 2293, retired Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Montgomery Scott, and Pavel Chekov attend the maiden voyage of the Federation star ship USS Enterprise-B, under the command of the unseasoned Capt. John Harriman (Alan Ruck). During the voyage, Enterprise is pressed into a rescue mission to save two El-Aurian ships from a strange energy ribbon. Enterprise is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but the star ship becomes trapped in the ribbon. Kirk goes to deflector control to alter the deflector dish, allowing Enterprise to escape, but the trailing end of the ribbon rakes across Enterprise's hull, exposing the section Kirk is in to space; he is presumed dead.
Although, one thing amongst the survivors, they are not happy to be aboard the enterprise and want to go back to the Gravimetric field. The Enterprise staff relegate that information to stress and trauma of losing comrades.In 2371, the crew of the USS Enterprise-D celebrate the promotion of Worf (Michael Dorn) to Lieutenant Commander. Worf's grandfather Colonel Worf had defended James T Krik and Dr McCoy at their trial on Klingon when they were falsely accused of murdering Chancellor Gorkon.Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives a message that his brother and nephew were killed in a fire, meaning the storied Picard family line will end with him. Enterprise receives a distress call from an observatory in orbit of the star Amargosa, where they rescue the El-Aurian Dr. Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell). The android Data (Brent Spiner) and engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) discover a compound called Trilithium in a hidden room of the observatory. Soran appears, knocks La Forge unconscious, and launches a Trilithium solar probe at Amargosa. The probe causes the star to implode, sending a shock wave toward the observatory.Soran and La Forge are transported away by a Klingon Bird of Prey belonging to the treacherous Duras sisters Lursa (Barbara March) and B'Etor (Gwynyth Walsh), who had stolen the Trilithium for Soran in exchange for the designs for a Trilithium weapon. Data is rescued just before the station is destroyed by the shock wave.
The other officers include Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Chief Medical Officer Commander Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), counselor Commander Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), Ensign Demora Sulu (Jacqueline Kim) (Daughter of Hikaru Sulu).Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Enterprise's bartender, tells Captain Jean-Luc Picard more about Soran; they were among the El-Aurians rescued by the Enterprise-B in 2293. Guinan explains that Soran is obsessed with reentering the ""Nexus"", an extra-dimensional realm where time has no meaning, and anyone can experience whatever they desire. Picard and Data determine that Soran, unable to fly a ship into the ribbon due to the uncertainty that the ship will survive long enough to ensure his success, is instead altering the path of the ribbon by destroying stars, and that he will attempt to re-enter the Nexus on Veridian III by destroying its sun-and, by altering the course of the ribbon to pass through an uninhabited planet (upon which Soran will be, as the ribbon passes through it). However, the shock wave from the collapsed star will completely destroy a nearby populated planet in the same system, with a population of 237 million.Upon entering the Veridian system, Enterprise makes contact with the Duras Bird of Prey. Picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for La Forge but insists that he be transported to Soran's location first. La Forge is returned to Enterprise, but he inadvertently reveals Enterprise's shield frequency, allowing the Duras sisters to inflict crippling damage on Enterprise. Enterprise destroys the Bird of Prey (Data fires an ionic pulse at the Klingon vessel, which resets its cloaking device and as the ship cloaks, it loses it shields allowing Enterprise to attack), but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. Commander William Riker orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship which separates from the star drive. The shock wave from the star drive's destruction sends the saucer crashing to the surface of Veridian III.Picard fails to talk Soran out of his plan and is too late to stop him from launching his missile. The collapse of the Veridian star alters the course of the Nexus ribbon as predicted, and it sweeps Picard and Soran away while the shock wave from the star obliterates everything in the system. In the Nexus, Picard finds himself surrounded by the family he never had, including a wife and children, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an ""echo"" of Guinan. After being told that he may leave whenever he chooses and go wherever and whenever he wishes, Guinan sends him to meet Kirk, also safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is at first reluctant to leave, Picard convinces Kirk to return to Picard's present and stop Soran by assuring him that it will fulfill his desire to make a difference.Leaving the Nexus, the two arrive on Veridian III minutes before Soran launches the missile. Kirk distracts Soran long enough for Picard to lock the missile in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill Soran. Kirk is fatally injured by a fall during the encounter; as he dies, Picard assures him that he made a difference. Picard buries Kirk before a shuttle arrives to transport him to the wreckage of the Enterprise saucer. Three Federation star ships enter orbit to retrieve Enterprise's survivors."

In fact, he's the only one there is! He's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Ace is on the case to find the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot and quarterback Dan Marino. He goes eyeball to eyeball with a man-eating shark, stakes out the Miami Dolphins and woos and wows the ladies. Whether he's undercover, under fire or underwater, he always gets his man . . . or beast!—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> The movie begins with our hero Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) rescuing a dog from an angry man, all but destroying his car in the process. The dog's owner, an attractive young woman, seduces Ace to avoid paying the detective's fee- a feat that Ace hardly resists.Late in the night at Miami Stadium, a group of individuals break in and steal the Miami Dolphins' mascot- a trained dolphin named Snowflake. Next morning, the Dolphin's Head of Operations Roger Podacter (Troy Evans) and his Chief Publicist named Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) are instructed to find the missing Snowflake before the upcoming Super Bowl (out of fear that the theft will affect the superstitious football players). A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this ""pet detective"" in to try investigating.Meanwhile, Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of $25,000 with no success. After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters (Antoni Corone and Margo Peace) away.Later that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice), Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have. Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn't a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups, who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin's ownership of Snowflake, may be responsible. At this point, Emilio's superior, attractive female Lt. Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) comes along and throws Ace out.Ace visits his hacker buddy Woodstock (Raynor Scheine) to try and find information relating to the purchase of equipment that would be necessary for handling a dolphin. Woodstock notices several purchases by a man named Ron Camp (Udo Kier), a billionaire who apparently enjoys gathering rare fish. Furthermore, Woodstock notes that Camp donated land to the Miami Dolphins for the building of a new stadium.Ace decides to investigate Ron Camp further and gets into a party thrown by Camp that evening with Melissa. As Camp attempts to seduce Melissa, Ventura investigates Camp's home and finds a large aquarium tank that he assumes holds the missing Snowflake. However, the tank actually holds a large shark and Ace barely escapes with his life.As Melissa and Ace leave the party, her very annoyed and him wet as a hen and with rags instead of pants, the detective notices an unusual ring on Camp's hand, manhandling the billionaire in order to get a closer look. When they return to the stadium, Ace informs Melissa of the stone he found in Snowflake's tank-and Camp's ring had the same kind of stones, but since no stones were missing, Camp was not the one responsible for Snowflake's abduction. The ring in question is a 1984 AFC Championship Ring, won by the Miami Dolphins. Ace decides to personally investigate all the ring-owners to find one with a missing stone, but before long his photographic list of suspects has run out with no results.Melissa attempts to console Ace about his failure to find the damaged ring. Ace is in no mood for her and they trade insults. As Ace goes inside to apologize, Melissa receives a devastating phone call- Roger Podacter is dead.The police investigate Podacter's apartment, learning that Roger's body was found after crashing through a sunroof twenty stories below his apartment balcony. Lt. Einhorn is in charge of the investigation and she is prepared to pronounce Podacter's death a suicide. Ace, however, disagrees, insisting that Roger was murdered. After interviewing Podacter's neighbor (Florence Mistrot), who had heard a scream in the apartment and the manager (who opened the balcony door to check the place), Ace's theory is proven- Roger's balcony door is made of soundproof glass and thus Roger's neighbor couldn't have heard a scream with the door closed- meaning that somebody else closed the door upon leaving the apartment after throwing Roger Podacter over the balcony.Despite proving his theory to the police, Ace is still upset about not finding the correct ring. Melissa takes Ace to the stadium office to investigate paperwork regarding the sale of the rings. There, Ace spots an unfamiliar player face that was not in his previous checklist. Melissa tells Ace that the player is a mid-season replacement kicker named Ray Finkle. Furthermore, Finkle is the player who allegedly kept the Dolphins from winning the 1984 Super Bowl- by missing the final field goal in an event known as ""The Kick Heard Round The World"", a reference to Scott Norwood's missed field goal kick in the closing moments of Super Bowl XXV. The result was Finkle's contract with the Dolphins being canceled and he never played football again.Ace drives to Finkle's childhood home and finds it covered in graffiti and damage from the still-bitter townsfolk. Finkle's father (Bill Zuckert) is outwardly hostile, pointing a gun at Ace until Mrs. Finkle (Alice Drummond), senile yet doting over her absent son. Ventura learns that Ray Finkle was institutionalized in a private hospital several years ago, but escaped soon after. A tour of Finkle's room shows a testament to his hatred of Dan Marino (Dan Marino himself), the player who held the ball for Finkle's Kick and who Ray blames for the whole thing insisting that Marino held the ball ""laces in"" instead of out, per regulations.Realizing that Marino is likely in danger, Ace telephones Melissa and requests extra security for the star player. Marino is filming a commercial for Isotoner gloves when he is tackled by two men in Miami Dolphins uniforms-apparently as part of the commercial. But when the ""Dolphins"" keep carrying Dan after the director yells CUT, everyone realizes what has happened. Ace attempts to stop the abductors but they evade capture.Einhorn finds Ace in her office after a press interview, infuriating her- until Ace mentions the name Ray Finkle. Ace shares his theory with the lieutenant- Finkle has come back to take his revenge right at Super Bowl time, when it will be most harmful to the Dolphins. Snowflake was the first target of revenge because the dolphin had been given Finkle's old number and taught to kick a field goal as part of the halftime show. Ace also theorizes that Podacter was murdered because he recognized Finkle from his previous tenure with the Dolphins. Lt. Einhorn actually applauds Ace's work, making physical advancements towards the pet detective- which Ace rebuffs.Desperate to find out more about Ray Finkle, Ace goes to the mental hospital where the ex-player was held in an attempt to search through any remaining belongings. Melissa poses as an anguished sister looking to commit her deranged, football-obsessed brother to give Ace a chance to explore the hospital. She talks to the doctor (David Margulies) while Ave looks into every room in the hospital. A check of the storage room reveals further examples of Finkle's hatred of Dan Marino along with an unusual news article- the failure of search parties to locate a missing hiker named Lois Einhorn.Emilio checks out Lt. Einhorn's desk at police headquarters, finding a love letter to the lieutenant from Roger Podacter dated several days before Rogers' death. Ace struggles to find the possible link between Finkle and Einhorn but cannot see any viable connection. When Ace's pet dog lies on a picture of Finkle (covering the player's short black hair with long red threads) Ventura finally realizes the truth- Einhorn used to be Finkle! Ace is overjoyed at finding the answer, but is apparently repulsed by the knowledge that the lieutenant who attempted to seduce him is a transgender woman.On the morning of the Super Bowl, Ace tails Einhorn to a remote boathouse where Dan Marino and Snowflake are being kept. Ace manages to defeat Einhorn's two henchmen but is caught by her and held at gunpoint before he can free Marino. She radios the police for assistance, claiming Ace is the one behind the abductions.Einhorn is distracted by a news report on the Super Bowl, repeating the '84 ""Kick Heard Round The World"" clip. In her rage, Ace is able to overpower her and Snowflake takes the lieutenant's gun away. As the police arrive, she orders them to shoot Ace- until Melissa arrives holding Emilio at gunpoint to distract the other police officers enough to let Ace finish the case.Ace explains the full details of Einhorn's new identity and plan, ripping off the woman's clothes in an effort to prove his point. However, Ace's efforts are at first unsuccessful in showing that Finkle is a transgender female. However, Dan Marino spots her genitalia tucked between her legs. Ace realizes that this is why Roger Podacter died- he learned of the sex Einhorn was assigned at birth.Enraged and humiliated by her public exposure, Einhorn attempts to stab the pet detective but Ace knocks her into the water with Snowflake. She staggers back out (her red hair now washed back to black thanks to the water) and Ace notices a ring on her finger. Ventura leans over and cheers in triumph- it is indeed the AFC Championship ring, missing a stone.Dan Marino and Snowflake are both returned to the Miami stadium in time for the Super Bowl halftime show. At the same time, Ace spots the rare bird he had been chasing at the beginning of the movie- only to have it chased away by the opposing teams' mascot (Mark Margolis). Ace and the costumed man get into a fight just as the stadium announcer brings the camera onto Ace Ventura to thank the pet detective for his actions in saving the Dolphins."

The method of traveling to the ends of the universe, instantly, a quantum leap, from one space to another, as simply walking from one room into another, this is the purpose of the Stargate. Now, in the present day, and for eons past, the Stargate has been hidden, forgotten, and buried, as time has progressed and histories have come and gone throughout the ages; the Stargate has once more been unearthed.

And so in the conflict between Man and the deadly demigod Ra begins, the Stargate is where it began, and with the Stargate it shall end.—Cinema_Fan PlotThe film begins in 1928, where Professor Langford discovers a massive stone ring in the sands of Giza, Egypt. In the present day, Langford's daughter Catherine offers Egyptologist Daniel Jackson, a down-on-his-luck linguistics professor, the chance to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs that may prove his controversial theory regarding the Pyramid of Khufu. Jackson accepts and travels to a US Air Force installation inside Creek Mountain, Colorado. Jackson translates the hieroglyphs on the outside ring of the stone, which read: ""A million years into the sky is Ra. Sealed and buried for all time, his Stargate."" Formerly retired Special Forces Colonel Jack O'Neil arrives to take command of the project and declares it classified.Jackson deduces that the symbols are star constellations that are coordinates for a location within space. The sequence is entered into the Stargate, creating a wormhole to Abydos, a planet in another galaxy. After O'Neil leads a team through the Stargate, they find themselves inside a pyramid in the middle of vast sand dunes. Jackson reveals they cannot dial home because the Stargate coordinates to go back to Earth are missing. Some team members stay at the pyramid while Jackson, O'Neil, and others go out and discover a mining village inhabited by humans who assume them to be gods sent by Ra.Jackson realizes that the people speak a dialect of Ancient Egyptian and begins communicating with them. The team develops friendships with the people; O'Neil with Skaara, and Jackson begins a budding romance with Sha'uri, a daughter of the leader. Jackson learns from hieroglyphs in the catacombs how the Egyptian god Ra was actually an alien life form (a Goa'uld) who enslaved humans with his advanced technology. While these humans eventually rebelled and buried the Stargate, some had been taken to Abydos through the Stargate and used to mine the quartzite-like mineral on which all of Ra's technology is based. Fearing another rebellion on Abydos, Ra outlawed reading and writing. At this point, the team from Earth discovers the cartouche needed to get back home, but the seventh symbol is eroded away.O'Neil orders the team to return to the pyramid. A short time later, a huge spacecraft lands on top of the pyramid. Ra's general, Anubis, flanked by warriors in avian-themed masks, hunt the soldiers throughout the pyramid's labyrinthine tunnels, dispatching them with blinding speed. O'Neil and Jackson are escorted to the throne room, where they meet Ra. Ra's guards unmask and are revealed to be human. Ra reveals his intention to send the atomic bomb brought by O'Neil, which was to be used to destroy the Stargate to prevent invasion by any threat, back to Earth; it is now enhanced with his quartzite-like material to produce cataclysmic results. O'Neil attempts to disarm the guards and kill Ra but relents when Ra uses his children courtiers as human shields. Jackson is killed during the altercation. O'Neil is thrown into a dungeon with the captured team members, while Jackson is regenerated in a sarcophagus-like device. Ra states that he will kill Jackson and everyone who has seen him unless Jackson kills the rest of the team to show the villagers that Ra is their one true god.However, once Ra has the local people gathered before the pyramid craft, several young villagers signal to Jackson that they have recovered the team's weapons. Jackson then shoots at Ra while the kids create a distraction. O'Neil, Jackson, and the rest of the team flee Ra's ship and take shelter in a cave with the boys. The next morning, when Skaara draws a picture of the people's victory against Ra, Jackson realizes that part of this drawing depicts the seventh symbol needed to reactivate the Stargate: three moons over a pyramid.Jackson convinces the locals that their ""gods"" are mere mortals and, with their help, O'Neil, Jackson, and the remaining members of the team make it back to the Stargate hoping to deactivate the bomb. When the locals begin an open rebellion against Ra's troops, Ra decides to retreat and prepares his ship for takeoff. Sha'uri is killed in the battle, but Jackson resurrects her in Ra's sarcophagus and manages to escape when O'Neil defeats Anubis and activates the ship's ring transporter. Unable to deactivate the bomb, O'Neil and Jackson transport the bomb to Ra's ship in orbit via the rings where it explodes, killing Ra. The team is able to return to Earth through the Stargate, though Jackson decides to remain on the planet.
[edit]
Director's cutThe Director's cut had several scenes which were cut from the theatrical film version. The first such scene took place immediately after the excavation of the Stargate in 1928 and showed petrified Horus guards near the cover stones; the producers had tried to introduce the idea that beings had attempted to come through the Stargate after its burial, but they cut the scene for time concerns.[2]"

Meanwhile, the beautiful daughter of his shrewd boss begins to fall for him - without realizing that the man she's begun to love is gradually turning into the creature by which he was bitten.—Mark Neuenschwander, <retro_critic@swiftboard.com> Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) has a pretty but estranged daughter, Laura (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is attracted to his subordinate, Will Randall (Jack Nicholson), who has recently been separated from his spouse, Charlotte (Kate Nelligan). Will is special, in a way, because he has been bitten by a seemingly dead wolf, and finds himself energized, his senses heightened, and has acquired a thirst for blood. He consults Dr. Vijay Alezais (Om Puri), who gives him an amulet that will prevent him from changing into a werewolf in return for a bite. Will refuses, but accepts the amulet as a gift. Will and Laura continue to meet, while Will's rival, Stewart Swinton (James Spader), who is also attracted to Laura, will force a confrontation between them, complicated by the involvement of the Police who suspect Will of killing his wife.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) While driving through Vermont, middle-aged Chief Editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) hits a wolf with his car. He stops the car to drag the animal out of the road, but the wolf is alive and bites his hand. He goes to the doctor, takes a rabies vaccine, and the doctor releases him.

Little by little, as the unknown but baneful infection spreads, Will comes to realise that his once-weary body, inexplicably, has become the host of a new set of powers and abilities, as his acute sensory perception marks the beginning of an indescribable and almost beastly transformation. Now, in the cut-throat publishing industry, no one is a match for the fresh and lupine Will; not even his much younger back-stabbing protégé, Stewart, or the publishing firm's new billionaire owner, Raymond Alden. Under those circumstances, could the legend be true? Is Will, indeed, turning into the cryptic creature known as the werewolf?—Nick Riganas Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) is bitten by a wolf while driving home in Vermont.

A woman named May Munro contacts and wants him to kill the three men who killed her family years ago, who work for the Leon crime family. Ray does it and after killing the first one, the Leons need to find the one who did it and it turns out Ned is now working for them and they task him with finding the bomber. The Leons get him to work with the police and he looks for the bomber. In the meantime Ray, while working on getting the others, can't help but follow May wherever she goes.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Ray Quick is an ex-CIA bomb expert now living as an high-tech outsider somewhere in Miami, Florida. May Munro has heard of his skills and tries over and over to convince Ray to bomb the guys who once killed her parents. Ray begins to overshadow May. He is interested in May's case, but still is of the opinion to never use his skills again. The situation changes dramatically when a former CIA comrade of Ray appears on the scene.—Oliver Heidelbach Ray Quick is a former CIA explosives expert turned bomber-for-hire living in Miami, Florida. Ray's latest client is a beautiful woman named May Munro, May hires Ray to assassinate Miami mobsters who murdered her parents when she was a child.

She hires Ray Quick, a retired explosives expert to kill her parent's killers. When Ned Trent, embittered ex-partner of Quick's is assigned to protect one of Quick's potential victims, a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues.—James Hastie <jdh1000@cus.cam.ac.uk> 1984. Ray Quick (Sylvester Stallone) and Ned Trent (James Woods) are explosives experts for the CIA, on an assignment to blow up a bridge while a certain vehicle is passing over it. Quick rigs everything on the bridge, after which Trent sets off the timer. As the target vehicle approaches, Quick sees a child inside, and pleads with Trent to stop the timer. Trent refuses. Quick runs back to the bridge and tries to disable the bomb there, but is too late. In the violent confrontation between Quick and Trent that follows, Quick vows that Trent's career in the CIA will be over because of this.Fast-forward to the ""present day,"" which is 1994. Trent is indeed out of the CIA and now works as head of security for a mobster named Joe Leon (Rod Steiger), but still seeks revenge on Quick. Quick has also left the CIA and now works as a free-lance bomber-for-hire. He lives secretively in an abandoned waterfront warehouse he has converted into an armed bunker, and refuses to meet personally with his clients or even let them contact him. His only communication with clients is when he contacts them, usually by taking public transit to another part of the city and using a pay phone.On one such bus ride, Quick gets out of his seat and offers it to a pregnant woman, only to have a young hoodlum take the seat instead. Quick calmly beats the crap out of the hoodlum and all his friends, throwing one of them out a window (not open), and then re-offers the seat to the woman. This scene has no bearing on the plot, but helps us get to know Quick.Quick has been hired by a young woman named May Munro (Sharon Stone) to kill the three men who killed her parents years ago, who happen to be Joe Leon's son Tomas (Eric Roberts) and two henchmen. Eventually we learn that May has been hired by Trent to lure Quick out into the open where Trent can get his revenge. As Trent describes the arrangement, ""You get your three corpses, I get Quick.""May not only wants her corpses but wants to watch Tomas Leon die, and therefore spends time at parties at the Leon compound. Tomas takes a liking to her and makes a pass, which May pretends to respond to favorably. But afterwards she is so disgusted at having been that close to him that, when she gets home, she throws the dress she was wearing while with him in the trash, and mopes around the house the rest of the evening in nothing but her panties. This also does not advance the plot in any way, but helps us get to know May.After Quick dispatches the two henchmen in separate incidents (the second involving a bomb with an LED screen that displays ""Bye Bye"" before it explodes), Joe Leon convinces his friend the chief of police that the police need Trent's explosives expertise to help solve the case. The chief arranges for Trent to work with the bomb squad. In order to impress and intimidate his new colleagues, Trent takes some parts lying on a table at the bomb squad headquarters, puts together a bomb, and activiates it, daring the cops to deactivate it before it explodes. When they are unable to, he does.When Quick takes out Tomas, May arranges to be in the same room, and introduces herself (her real identity) to him right before the explosion. She is not injured but fakes her own death by going to the hospital and dropping her wallet into the purse of a dying junkie. Stallone goes to the funeral of the woman identified as May Munro, and finds the living May there, who is lurking in the background expecting him to show. They leave, after which Trent arrives somewhat less unobtrusively, confronting the priest at gunpoint and demanding that the coffin be opened.Quick and May go to a hotel, where their interactions in the bedroom and the shower go beyond discussion of business. But May leaves in the morning while Quick is still asleep and is captured by Trent, who forces her to reveal Quick's location. But when Trent and his men arrive at the hotel room, Quick is gone, and explosives he has rigged detach that portion of the hotel (with some of Trent's men in it) from the building as a whole, falling into the water below.With Trent prepared to kill her if she doesn't cooperate, May arranges to meet with Quick at a waterfront restaurant, but is able to word things in such a way that Quick recognizes that it's a trap. Quick and May escape out the back in a boat, but in an impressive bit of detective work, Trent and the cops determine the location of Quick's residence, and arrive the next morning with what looks like the entire police force. But Quick has the whole place rigged, and after several huge displays of pyrotechnics, Quick and May escape yet again. This time Trent does not.Along the way May has learned that it was Joe Leon himself who ordered the hit on her parents. So in the end, we find Joe opening a small package, in which he finds a locket, which he opens to reveal a picture of May's parents. Boom. Watching from nearby, May gets into a car with Quick and they drive away."
Four Weddings and a Funeral,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109831/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Over the course of five social occasions, a committed bachelor must consider the notion that he may have discovered love. In Britain, slightly bumbling and always tardy Charles (Hugh Grant) and his closest group of friends seem always to be attending weddings, but are never the bride nor groom, and as such, each, with the exception of gay couple Gareth (Simon Callow) and Matthew (John Hannah), is looking for love. At the wedding of their friends, Angus (Timothy Walker) and Laura (Sara Crowe), where Charles is acting as best man, Charles meets an American woman named Carrie (Andie MacDowell). For him, it's love at first sight. She too is attracted to him. Although they spend a memorable evening together, that's all it ends up being. Over three more successive weddings - some of the brides and grooms who are very near and dear to Charles' heart - and one unfortunate funeral, Charles runs into Carrie, but something always seems to prevent the two of them from getting together. He also runs into a plethora of old girlfriends, one of whom he may believe is really the one he was meant to end up with, especially if Carrie seems to remain unobtainable. Will Charles settle for who in his heart is second best, or will fate finally bring Charles and Carrie together?—Huggo Charming but insecure Charles keeps entering bad relationships and attending other, usually rich and posh people's weddings, repeatedly as best man, yet keeps oversleeping and messing things up, even forgetting the rings, luckily perfectly-organized gay couple Mathew and Gareth -untul the latter's fatal cardiac crisis during a grand wedding- help out, while other can go wrong even worse, like trainee-priest Gerald's unforgettable verbal slip-ups. Still Charles feels lucky when he thus meets American journalist Caroline 'Carrie', who is in for non-committal sex, but out of the country or engaged to another before Charles can make up his mind to properly move on her. Charles's deaf kid brother David gives him the courage to stand up for true love when it seems lost.—KGF Vissers In the beginning of the film, we see that Charles (Hugh Grant), a confirmed British bachelor and serial monogamist, lives with his tone-deaf sister Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) in London. The pair are habitually late to weddings (as we gather from remarks made by others at the wedding they attend late right now, which is the first wedding in the film). At the wedding, Charles meets Carrie, an American (Andie McDowell) and ends up spending the night with her. Also at the wedding, David (David Bower), the deaf younger brother of Charles and Scarlett, is targeted as an object of affection by a guest. We see that Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and Tom (James Fleet) are brother and sister and very wealthy and Gareth (Simon Callow) and Matthew (John Hannah) are a gay couple. We also briefly meet Bernard and Lydia who are at the wedding. Bernard (David Haig) likes Lydia (Sophie Thompson), but she dismisses him, saying that she is not as desperate as that. As the friends leave the wedding, we see Bernard and Lydia kissing passionately.Charles ends up spending the night with Carrie and is surprised to see that she is leaving in the morning and returning back to America. The next thing we know, Charles and Scarlett are late again to wedding number 2 in the film, that of Bernard and Lydia. Father Gerald (Rowan Atkinson) officiates the service, his first, and seems to be unable to say the names of the bride and groom right and some other cues for added humor (Rowan needs no introduction of course).Charles is elated to see Carrie at the wedding, until she introduces him to her fiance, a boorish, Scottish politician who is much older than she. To top things off, Charles is stuck at a table with four of his ex girlfriends. The girl who liked David introduces herself to him in faulty sign language and he is enchanted with her. Despite the fact she is engaged, Carrie sleeps with Charles again that evening after her fiance has gone off to Scotland. We now see that the two really care for one another.The interim is when Charles receives an invitation to Carrie's wedding to Hamish Banks (Corin Redgrave) in Scotland. He goes to a very expensive store to choose a gift and meets Carrie. They spend a few hours shopping for her wedding dress and having a drink in a pub where Carrie reveals that she has had 33 lovers. After they part, Charles rushes off to tell Carrie that he loves her, but stops short. Instead, he refers to the ""words of David Cassidy"" which is the song ""I Think I Love You."" Carrie is affected, but kisses him on the cheek and moves on.The next wedding is the third in the film and is that of Carrie and Hamish in Scotland. It is here where Scarlett meets a tall Texan named Chester (Randall Paul) who fancies her. Gareth tells everyone to find spouses for themselves. We find out that Fiona has been in love with Charles since she has known him and she reveals this to the stunned Charles and a table mate. Tragedy strikes when Gareth dies suddenly, presumably of a heart attack, at the wedding.Now is time for the funeral - that of Gareth. Matthew gives the eulogy, which is the poem ""Funeral Blues"" by WH Auden. Carrie attends the funeral and sees Charles. Charles and Tom end up talking and Tom says that he is not waiting for the lightening bolt to hit, he just wants to meet someone and settle down.We then see an invitation for the fourth wedding, Charles and xxxx. The audience does not know that he will be marrying Henrietta, his slightly wacky ex-girlfriend who was at weddings 2 and 3. The friends get to the wedding where Tom meets his distant relative while seating the guests and feels ""the thunderbolt."" Carrie appears at the wedding and tells Charles that she is separated from Hamish and that their timing has been very bad. Charles does not know what to do - he loves Carrie but is now committed to marrying Henrietta (Anna Chancellor).David, who now is very steady with the young lady who learned sign language is at the wedding along with Scarlet and Chester. When Charles stays in the back of the church and asks Tom to delay the wedding, David wants to know what is going on. He tells Charles that he has three choices - he can go on with the wedding or tell everyone that the wedding is off. He says he can't think of number three.Charles stands with Henrietta to get married and when the priest asks for objections, David comes up with the third idea. He objects to the wedding. He asks Charles to translate for him and says that the groom loves someone else. When the priest asks if he does love someone else, Charles answers ""I do"" and gets punched in the eye by the bride. Chaos erupts at the church.The next scene is in the home of Charles and Scarlett with all the friends present. Carrie comes to the door and Charles, in the rain and outside, finally starts to let some of his feelings out. He asks her if she will agree ""not to marry him"" for the rest of their lives. Carrie answers ""I do.""The song ""Going To The Chapel"" is then played as we see Henrietta marry a member of the guard, Scarlett marry Chester, David marry his girlfriend, Tom marry the distant relative, Matthew with a new partner (Duncan Kenworthy), Fiona marrying Prince Charles, and Charles and Carrie with their son, presumably not married."

A host of celebrities at the Academy Awards ceremony are humiliated by Frank as he blunders his way trying to foil Rocco.—Rob Hartill Frank Drebin (Nielsen) has retired from police work and lives a basically happy life with his wife Jane (Presley).

Additionally, Jane tries to push him into siring a child, but Frank does not have the courage to go through this yet.It comes as a blessing to him when his old friends Ed Hocken (Kennedy) and Nordberg (Simpson) come by and ask for his help in an investigation. The Police Squad has caught wind that a well-known bomber named Rocco Dillon (Ward), who is currently incarcerated, has been hired by a terrorist (Papshmir, known from the first movie) to conduct a major terrorist act against the United States. An important contact, Tanya Peters (Smith), Rocco's girlfriend, proves to be a dead end, so Drebin is asked to join Dillon undercover in prison, befriend him, and then leak details of the plan to his colleagues.

A poetic guitarist Eric Draven is brought back to life by a crow a year after he and his fiancée are murdered. The crow guides him through the land of the living, and leads him to his killers: knife thrower Tin-tin, drugetic Funboy, car buff T-Bird, and the unsophisticated Skank. One by one, Eric gives these thugs a taste of their own medicine. However their leader Top-Dollar, a world-class crime lord who will dispatch his enemies with a Japanese sword and joke about it later, will soon learn the legend of the crow and the secret to the vigilante's invincibility.—Don Hoffman Detroit, October 30. Somewhere in the city's dark underbelly the night before Halloween, up-and-coming rock star Eric Draven and his lovely fiancée Shelly Webster fall prey to local crime lord Top Dollar and his vicious henchmen. But no one is safe from harm on Devil's Night. The universe, however, hates injustice. And as Eric's restless soul crosses over, a merciful crow intervenes to right a wrong. With the baleful raven as the only link between the physical and the unseen world, unfathomable forces grant pale Eric Draven permission to take his rightful revenge on those who robbed him of his everything. Now, the vipers must pay in blood. But can death's redemption reunite the ill-fated lovers?—Nick Riganas ""People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right.""October 30, Devil's Night, in Detroit. Sergeant Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is at the scene of a crime where Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) has been beaten and raped and her fiancé, local musician and guitarist Eric Draven (Brandon Lee), has been murdered, having been stabbed, shot, and thrown out of their apartment window to the streets below. The couple had been planning their wedding for the next day; Halloween. A cop comments darkly, ""Who gets married on Halloween?"" Albrecht responds, ""Nobody.""As he prepares to leave for the hospital with Shelly, Albrecht meets a young girl with a skateboard named Sarah (Rochelle Davis) who says she is a friend of Eric and Shelly and that they took care of her. Albrecht tells her that Shelly probably won't survive.One year later, a crow flies over the dark and rainy landscape of Detroit and lands on the headstone of Eric Draven. It taps at the stone with its beak, awakening Eric from the grave. He climbs out of the ground, trembling and wracked with convulsions. With some confusion, he stands and walks with the crow to his abandoned apartment, finding it in shambles. Memories of the night of his death come back to him as the gang responsible runs through the city, setting fire to it. The faces of the attackers stick in his mind and overcome with grief, he grabs the frame of a broken tympanum window, the glass cutting deep into his palms. To his astonishment, the blood from the wounds flows back into his skin and the wounds heal themselves. Bent on vengeance, he changes his clothes and paints his face white in parody of a porcelain harlequin mask he had given Shelly as a gift. He then draws black liner around his eyes and down his cheeks like tears and paints his lips black with Glasgow lines reaching out from the corners. Guided by the crow and sharing the crow's high perspective on the city, Eric sets out to avenge his and Shelly's murders.The first person he locates is Tin Tin (Laurence Mason), a thug obsessed with knives. Eric engages in hand-to-hand combat. He wins the fight by catching a knife and pinning Tin Tin to the wall with it. Eric confronts him about the murders the previous year and Tin Tin laughs in his face, mocking Shelly. Eric finishes him off by stabbing him in each vital organ (""in alphabetical order"") with his own knives and takes his trench coat, leaving a crow-shaped bloodstain on the wall of the alley. Using Tin Tin's memories, he goes to the pawn shop where Tin Tin sold Shelly's engagement ring. Eric forces the owner, Gideon (Jon Polito), to show him where the ring is located and finds it mixed in a box with dozens of other rings. He lets Gideon live so that he can deliver a message of death to the rest of the gang before he douses the counters in gasoline, loads a shotgun with other rings of destroyed lives, and fires, igniting the shop in a massive explosion. Gideon escapes alive but badly burned.Eric locates the next thug on his list, Funboy (Michael Massee), getting high in an apartment with Sarah's drug-addicted mother, Darla (Anna Thomson). Funboy shoots Eric in his hand and Eric mocks him by pretending to scream in pain before showing the hole in his palm heal before his eyes. Frightened, Funboy is easily disarmed by Eric and is shot in the thigh before being injected with an overdose of morphine. Eric then confronts Darla but merely says that morphine is bad for her, forcing the drug out of her arm seemingly by magic, and tells her that she should return to her daughter who is surviving alone on the streets.Albrecht, meanwhile, has been following the deaths of the thugs around town. He doesn't share the rest of the department's view on the killings, thinking of them as more of a blessing than a curse. He even goes so far as to rescue Eric as he flees from choppers after his latest killing, though Eric is quick to disappear afterwards. Upon meeting again later on, Eric explains what he's doing and offers his best reason as to why he's come back. Albrecht tells him what he knows of Shelly's death and reveals that he stayed with her as she suffered through thirty hours of agony before dying. Eric touches Albrecht and receives from him all the pain felt by Shelly during that time.Gideon goes to Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), the leader of all gangs in Detroit, and warns him about Eric. Top Dollar responds by stabbing Gideon through the throat with a sword, sinking it to the hilt, as his lover/half sister/soothsayer, Myca (Bai Ling), looks on with glee. Around the same time, two of Top Dollar's thugs, T-Bird (David Patrick Kelly) and Skank (Angel David) stop by with the news about Tin-Tin's murder. Top Dollar shows only virtually no concern for Tin-Tin's demise and snorts cocaine from a large pile.T-Bird and Skank stop at a convenience store for supplies. Eric sneaks into the T-Bird's classic Ford Thunderbird and kidnaps him while Skank is in the store. Eric forces T-Bird to drive at high speed through the streets. Skank runs into the street, gets hit by a car & steals it to follow the pair; he watches as Eric ties T-Bird to the driver's seat of a car with explosives strapped to him & lets the car drive off the pier where it explodes midair and sinks into the harbor. When the police arrive, they discover a fiery symbol in the shape of a crow at the scene.Meanwhile, Darla tries to reconcile with Sarah by making her breakfast; though Sarah is skeptical at first of her mother's sudden change of heart, she accepts the effort and hugs her. Albrecht's ""superior"" chews him out just because he can & tells him he's suspended for misconduct.Sarah goes to Eric's apartment and speaks out to the shadows, feeling that he must be nearby. She tells him that she misses him and Shelly but, when no one responds, goes to leave and says that she figured he wouldn't care anymore. Eric speaks to her, appearing in the window, and tells her that, although they cannot be friends anymore, he still cares about her.Skank retreats to the gang hideout, rambling wildly about Eric; Sarah & Albrecht bond over their mutual experiences w/ Eric & discuss how he came back.At the gang hideout, Top Dollar, hardly concerned for T-Bird's fate, is discussing plans for criminal activity on Devil's Night with his other criminal associates. Eric crashes the meeting looking for Skank, and proceeds to mock everyone in the room. Dollar orders him killed and his associates all open fire, forcing Eric off the large conference table. He rises after a few moments and a massive gunfight ensues. Top Dollar escapes with Myca and his lieutenant, Grange (Tony Todd). Eric easily kills everyone in the room by gun, fists & swords, saving Skank for last, throwing him out the window. The police arrive to find Eric the last man standing; he escapes w/ Albrecht's help.Top Dollar, Grange, and Myca discuss Eric and his unique abilities. Myca reveals that Eric is invulnerable to harm, but only if his link to the real world, the crow, remains untouched. Realizing that if they kill the crow they can kill Eric and the three of them hatch a plan.Having killed the last of the four who had murdered him and Shelly, Eric returns to the cemetery and visits Shelly's grave. Sarah meets him there to say goodbye and he gives her Shelly's engagement ring as a necklace. Sarah leaves the cemetery only to be abducted by Grange and taken to a local church where Top Dollar and Myca are hiding out. Through the crow, Eric sees that Sarah is in danger and goes to rescue her. The crow flies inside ahead of him but is sniped by Grange. Eric, not realizing what wounding the crow has done for his own invulnerability, accosts Top Dollar, saying he'll let him leave if he gives Sarah to Eric. Top Dollar shoots Eric, now no longer invincible and beats him; Sarah is taken to the upper levels of the church. Albrecht, having gone to the church to pay his respects, realizes what's happening & comes in shooting. He finds Eric on the floor and helps him towards the spiral staircase in the back. The wounded crow is picked up by Myca, who hopes to harness its mystical powers. Albrecht manages to shoot and kill Grange, but is wounded himself. He stays below as Eric ascends the stairs. Myca meets him halfway up, holding the crow at knifepoint, but the crow lunges up and pecks her eyes out, causing her to fall from the stairs to her death.Eric makes it to the roof where Top Dollar is holding Sarah. He pushes her off the roof though she manages to hold onto some scaffolding as Top Dollar and Eric fight. Distracted for a moment by Sarah's cries for help, Eric is stabbed through the back by Top Dollar who admits to having everything to do with Eric and Shelly's deaths, claiming that nothing goes on in their town without his say-so. He tell Eric that he's enjoyed their sparring & that he'll miss him, but before he can kill him, Eric grabs him and bestows his gratitude for Top Dollar's crimes: all of the thirty hours of pain Shelly had to endure at once. In agonizing pain, Top Dollar falls off the roof and is impaled on a gargoyle.Eric rescues Sarah and brings her to Albrecht who is soon taken to an ambulance. Eric then disappears from sight and crawls to Shelly's grave before passing out. Her spirit comes to him, sans face paint, and they are finally reunited.Later, Sarah visits Eric's grave, which has closed up once again. The crow stands on his headstone, holding Shelly's ring that Sarah lost during her abduction. The crow drops it in Sarah's hand. As it flies off into the night, Sarah narrates that, though buildings burn and people die, real love is forever.The film closes with the words ""For Brandon and Eliza"", a dedication to both Brandon Lee, who was accidentally killed during filming in 1993, and Eliza Hutton, who was Brandon's partner, until his death in 1993."
Natural Born Killers,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110632/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two victims of traumatized childhoods become lovers and psychopathic serial murderers irresponsibly glorified by the mass media. Mickey Knox and Mallory Wilson aren't your typical lovers - after killing her abusive father, they go on a road trip where, every time they stop somewhere, they kill pretty well everyone around them. They do however leave one person alive at every shootout to tell the story and they soon become a media sensation thanks to sensationalized reporting. Told in a highly visual style.—garykmcd The misadventures of Mickey and Mallory: outcasts, lovers, and serial killers. They travel across Route 666 conducting psychadelic mass-slaughters not for money, not for revenge, just for kicks. Glorified by the media, the pair become legendary folk heroes; their story told by the single person they leave alive at the scene of each of their slaughters.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Delivery boy Mickey Knox falls in love with customer Mallory Wilson. He soon helps her kill her abusive father and enabling mother, beginning their macabre journey down Route 666. Their M.O.: every few miles, they attack everyone within their site, invariably leaving only one person alive to tell the tale. The two are made famous by unscrupulous reporter Wayne Gale, as they run across the countryside, pursued by the equally sadistic Jack Scagnetti. Just before the trial, a ratings-whoring interview by the same reporter who made them famous leads to pandemonium, not just within the prison itself, but nationwide. A satire of the media, public opinion, and the modern attitude toward violence.—T. Brendan Leahy IntroductionMickey Knox and his wife Mallory go to a roadside café in the New Mexico desert. They appear to be normal customers, with Mickey eating key lime pie and Mallory dancing to rock 'n' roll on the jukebox. A group of rednecks arrive and one begins dancing and flirting with Mallory. She encourages him for a moment, then attacks him without provocation by smashing his beer bottle as he drinks from it. A fistfight ensues, with Mallory beating the man. When the redneck's friend intervenes, Mickey cuts off one of the cowboy's fingers and stabs him with a large Bowie-style knife. Mickey and Mallory then begin killing the diner's patrons, culminating in a morbid game of ""Eeny, meeny, miny, moe"" to decide who lives and who dies among the last 2 customers. After executing their final victim, Mabel the waitress, the couple make sure the only survivor, a cook, remembers their names and promises to tell the authorities who committed the massacre before they embrace and declare their undying love for each other.Part IMickey and Mallory are in a desert at night. Mallory is reminiscing about when they first met. A flashback shows Mickey as a butcher's deliveryman who came to the house where Mallory lived with her abusive father (Rodney Dangerfield), her neglectful mother (Edie McClurg), and her younger brother Kevin. The flashback is portrayed as a 1950s-type sitcom with a canned laughter track, the ""audience"" laughing hardest when Mallory is subjected to lewd comments and hints of molestation by her father.Mickey instantly falls in love with Mallory. They leave together, Mickey stealing Mallory's father's car. Mickey is arrested and imprisoned for grand theft auto, but he subsequently escapes a horse work farm during a tornado and returns to Mallory's house. The two kill her father by beating him with a jack handle and drowning him in a fish tank, then burn her mother alive in bed. They spare her ten-year-old brother, Mallory telling him that he is free. They leave to rapturous applause from the ""audience.""Mickey and Mallory get ""married"" on the side of a bridge, exchanging snake wedding bands, cutting their palms and mixing their blood which drips down into the river below. They drive to a motel for the night. After watching television, they begin to have sex until Mickey is distracted by a female hostage. Furious with Mickey's notion that they have a threesome, Mallory drives to a nearby gas station where she flirts with the mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but Mallory is angered by his over-aggressive oral sex and shoots him to death. Back at the motel, Mickey rapes the hostage.Part IIThe pair continue their killing-spree (which bears similarities to Bonnie and Clyde and the Starkweather-Fugate murders), ultimately claiming 48 victims along Route 666 in New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. Pursuing them are two characters who see the murderers as a chance to achieve fame for themselves.The first is a policeman, Detective Jack Scagnetti, who seems particularly fascinated by Mallory. Scagnetti is already a well-known personality, a published author, whose book ""Scagnetti on Scagnetti"" is a best-seller within law enforcement. Scagnetti has a lifelong obsession with mass murderers after witnessing his mother being shot and killed by Charles Whitman in Austin, Texas when he was eight. Despite his heroic facade, he is actually sociopathic, strangling a prostitute to death in a hotel room after he tries to get too rough with her & she scratches his face.The second follower of the killers is journalist Wayne Gale, an Australian who hosts a show called American Maniacs, which profiles mass murderers. Various clips of Mickey and Mallory are shown, with Gale acting outraged on-screen as he details the pair's crimes, although off-air he clearly regards them as a fantastic way of increasing his show's ratings. It is Gale who is primarily responsible for elevating Mickey and Mallory to hero status, with his show featuring interviews with people around the world expressing their admiration for the killers.Mickey and Mallory become lost in the desert and encounter Warren Red Cloud, a Navajo Indian, and his pre-adolescent grandson. After the two fall asleep, the Navajo, hoping to expel the demon he perceives in Mickey, begins chanting beside the fire, invoking nightmares in Mickey about his abusive parents. Mickey wakes up in a rage and fatally shoots the Navajo before he realizes what he is doing. It is the first time Mallory and Mickey feel guilty for a murder. While fleeing from the scene through the desert, they stray into a field of rattlesnakes and are both bitten.They drive to a drugstore to find snake antivenin, but the pharmacist sets off the silent alarm before Mickey kills him. Police cars pull up. Mallory is captured immediately and is subsequently beaten by the sadistic and brutish police. A gunfight breaks out between Mickey and the others. When Scagnetti arrives, he tells Mickey that unless he surrenders he'll cut off Mallory's breasts, slashing her a few times with his knife. Mickey gives up his gun, but he attacks Scagnetti with a knife. The police use tazers on him, and the scene ends with Mickey and Mallory being beaten by a group of vengeful policemen while Scagnetti excitedly looks on.Part IIIThe story picks up one year later. The homicidal couple have been imprisoned -- a trial is only hinted at in footage provided by Gale. The two have killed several people in prison, including inmates and guards. Mallory herself has murdered her psychiatrist. Both are due to be moved to a mental hospital after being declared insane. Scagnetti arrives at the prison and encounters Dwight McClusky, the sleazy and abusive warden of the prison. The two devise a plan to murder the two criminals: McClusky will arrange for Scagnetti to be the driver for the Knox's transfer. Alone with the pair, Scagnetti will kill them, claiming they tried to escape.Wayne Gale has persuaded Mickey to agree to a live interview, to air immediately after the Super Bowl. Mallory is held in solitary confinement elsewhere in the prison, awaiting her transport to the mental hospital. In preparation for his TV appearance, Mickey shaves his head.During the interview, Mickey gives a speech about how murder provides enlightenment and declares himself a ""natural born killer."" His words inspire the other inmates (who are watching the interview on TV in the recreation room) and incite them to riot.When word of the riot reaches McClusky, he orders the interview terminated over Gale's violent protests. Mickey is left alone with Gale, the TV crew and several guards. Using a lengthy joke as a diversion, Mickey overpowers a guard and grabs his shotgun and kills most of the guards and some of Gale's crew. Mickey takes the survivors hostage, leading them through the prison riot, intending to reunite with Mallory. Gale follows, excitedly giving a live television report as people are beaten and killed around him. Inmates torture and murder prisoners and guards alike.During the interview and outbreak of the riot, Scagnetti is in Mallory's cell, attempting to seduce her. Mallory plays along for a short time, then attacks Scagnetti violently, smashing his face against the wall and breaking his nose. The guards and Scagnetti subdue her.Still live on national television, Mickey bursts into Mallory's cell and engages in a brief Mexican standoff with Scagnetti, eventually feigning a concession. Mallory then approaches Scagnetti from behind and slashes his throat with a shank. Mickey then reveals that the shotgun was unloaded, much to Scagnetti's horror. Mallory picks up Scagnetti's loaded gun and kills him.They continue to escape through the riot-torn prison, with two guards as hostages. The remainder of Gale's TV crew are killed. Gale himself snaps and begins to shoot at the guards, claiming to be ""alive for the first time in [his] life"" while calling his wife and telling her he's been cheating on her with another woman.After being rescued by a mysterious prisoner named Owen Traft, the trio of Mickey, Mallory and Gale run into Warden McClusky and a heavily armed posse of guards. Cavanaugh, the guard they'd taken hostage, is shot to death by McClusky's men. In retaliation, Mallory shoots Gale thru his hand & they retreat, taking cover in a blood-splattered shower room. Gale calls his wife and tells her he is leaving her. He calls his mistress to tell her he will see her later, however, she hangs up on him.McClusky threatens to storm the shower room. Mickey in turn, duct-tapes shotguns to the necks of Gale & a guard, Homolka, threatening to kill both on live TV. The prisoners walk out the front door. McClusky and his guards are massacred by hordes of inmates who burst into the area. They tear McClusky apart, cutting his head off and displaying it on a spike (a shot removed from the theatrical showing and seen in the director's cut only).After the escape, Owen is never seen or mentioned again. Mickey and Mallory steal a van and kill the last guard. Escaping to a rural location, they give a final interview to Wayne Gale before, much to his surprise and horror, they tell him he must also die. Gale futilely attempts to change their minds, finally appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one witness to tell the tale. Mickey inform hims they are leaving his camera as the witness. Gale accepts his fate and extends his arms as if crucified as they shoot him numerous times while his unattended camera continues to roll.The couple are shown several years later in an RV, with Mickey driving and Mallory (who is pregnant) watching their two children play."
Angels in the Outfield,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109127/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a boy prays for a chance to have a family if the California Angels win the pennant, angels are assigned to make that possible. Roger, who has lost his mother, is living separated from his father. As he and his friend J.P. are fans of the California Angels baseball team, he has got only two dreams: living together with a real family and seeing the Angels winning the Pennant.—Volker Boehm Roger Bowman lives in a foster home with his best friend, J.P., but when his dad comes to visit him, a little bit of hope grows back into his heart about him going back to live with his dad. But his hopes suddenly die down when his dad says that they can be a family again when his favorite baseball team, the California Angels, win the pennant, but they are in last place in their division. So Roger prays to Heaven and ask if the angels up there can help them win the pennant so Roger can have the family that he always wanted, and because of his prayer, he just might.—nick_z13 The California Angels are currently the worst team in their division. It seems that they have a little trouble with their teamwork. Manager George Knox would like nothing better than to dump all of them, which the owner, Hank, says is impossible. Roger is a boy whose mother died and is currently living in a foster home with his best friend, J.P.. His father feels that it would probably be in Roger's best interest if he becomes a ward of the state. But Roger would rather get back together with him, and when he asks him if that is possible, his reply is ""when the Angels win the pennant"". Roger then prays and asks if they could help them. When he goes to a game, he sees some angels come down from the sky and help the players make some astounding catches and hits. When he tells George about it, he decides to keep him at every game, and it seems that his faith is put to the test because it seems that the Angels are going to help if he uses his worst players, but it seems to be working.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Young foster child Roger Bomman and his friend, J.P., love to sneak into baseball games of the struggling California Angels. Still in limited contact with his widowed father, Roger asks when they will be a family again. His father replies sarcastically, ""I'd say when the Angels win the pennant."" Taking his father's words literally, he prays for God to help the Angels win. In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays which Roger and J.P. attend, he sees a group of angels led by Al helping the team. Although he can see them quite clearly, everyone else can only explain the seemingly impossible acts as freak occurrences. Roger's unique ability to see which players are receiving help from angels leads their skeptical manager George Knox to keep him around as a good luck charm and consultant. Due to the much-needed help, the Angels start to win games and make a surprising second-half surge to the top of their division.Roger's father permanently gives up custody of him, believing it's in Roger's best interest. As Roger laments his loss, an equally distraught J.P. accidentally reveals to antagonistic sportscaster Ranch Wilder that Roger has the ability to see angels, and that George has been winning through the advice Roger gave him. Hoping to destroy George's career in baseball due to a long-time mutual hatred between them, Wilder informs the press of this, and their owner Hank Murphy threatens to relieve George of his management responsibilities. Roger comes clean to his caretaker Maggie Nelson about his special ability, and at a press conference, they and the entire team defend George in front of the press. Moved by their faith, Murphy allows him to remain as the Angels' manager.During the final game of the season against the rival Chicago White Sox, none of the angels show up to help the team. Later on, Al appears to Roger and explains that championships must be decided without the angels' intervention. He also says that he is there to check on pitcher Mel Clark, who only has 6 months to live due to his years of smoking and will become an angel himself. Mel struggles in the ninth inning but perseveres after encouragement from George, his team, and the fans in attendance. The Angels ultimately win the game on their own and clinch the division title and the pennant, while Wilder is fired for his denigration of the team. George adopts Roger and J.P., as he wants to try to be a father. J.P. sees Al and says, ""I knew it could happen."" Al flies off and says, ""We're always watching""."

But when his wife is killed, Max must go back in time to fight a corrupt politician, who is intent on changing the past to control the future. In 1863, Confederate soldiers are carrying a gold bullion as a payday for the army. Suddenly, they are cornered and shot by a highwayman using anachronistic automatic pistols and futuristic tech equipment, leaving them stranded and dead. The mysterious highwayman steals the trunk containing the gold and then suddenly vaporizes into a gelatin like mist.In 1994, 131 years later in Washington DC, the U.S. government creates the Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) to combat the misuse of newly developed time travel technology. They have discovered that the same gold bullion was used in recent arms purchases. The TEC is to detect ""time ripples"" among the time-lines and to stop them from happening before they reach the present, since people cannot travel forward in time to the future, they always travel back to either change history or steal riches. (Note: the mysterious highwayman who killed the Confederate soldiers in 1863 to steal their gold is never seen again or identified). Senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver) volunteers to fund and oversee the commission.Meanwhile, police officer Max Walker (Jean Claude Van Damme) is offered a job as a TEC agent. He meets his wife Melissa (Mia Sara) at a local shopping mall where he stops a purse snatcher. He notices three odd-looking punk men following them despite never seeing them before. Walker and Melissa go home to their large fancy house and later make love.Later that same evening, Max is attacked in his home by the same intruders he saw earlier at the mall and Melissa is killed in an explosion, destroying his house.Ten years later in the year 2004, Walker is now a veteran TEC Agent. He is sent back to October 1929, in the midst of the Wall Street crash to arrest his former partner Atwood (Jason Schombing) for taking advantage of the U.S. stock-market crash. After subduing Atwood's bodyguards, Walker interrogates Atwood who reveals that he is working for Senator McComb, who needs money for his presidential campaign. Terrified by McComb's threat by sending hit-men back in time to murder his ancestors, thereby wiping out his existence, Atwood tries to kill himself by jumping out a window. Walker catches him as he falls and takes him back to 2004, but Atwood refuses to testify against McComb and the TEC agency sends him back to 1929, right where he left off, this time falling to his death.Senator McComb arrives at the TEC agency to oversee the work and to congratulate Walker for his recent successful mission. Walker implies to McComb that he knows all about his dirty dealings behind the scenes in Washington and about his means to acquire money for his campaign. McComb leaves the facility and orders his aide to have Walker killed. The next morning, two assassins break into Walker's small apartment and attempt to kill him, but Walker, a trained martial arts expert, kills both assassins after a violent and protracted fight.While still trying to investigate McComb to expose him of corruption, Walker is partnered with agent Sarah Fielding (Gloria Reuben), and sent back to 1994 to investigate a pending ripple, where they find a young Senator McComb arguing with his business partner Jack Parker about their company's new computer chip. Parker offers to buy McComb's share of the company, but suddenly, the older McComb arrives from 2004 to warn his younger self that the chip will make huge profits. A fight starts when Walker is double-crossed by Fielding, who reveals she works for McComb. McComb kills Parker, wounds Fielding, attempts to kill Walker, and manages to escape back to 2004.When Walker returns to 2004, he finds that things have become worse. McComb now owns the computer company, with no record of Parker. He is almost guaranteed the Presidency with his finances and approval rating. The TEC is being shut down due to budget cuts. There is also no record of Fielding. Realizing that he has to fix things, Walker hijacks the original prototype time machine (which McComb had been using for their illegal trips) with the help of Commander Matuzak (Bruce McGill), who sacrifices himself when McComb's men try to stop Walker from escaping.Finding himself once more in 1994, Walker finds Fielding in the hospital, where she agrees to testify against McComb. Whilst trying to find Fielding's DNA from a blood sample in the lab, Walker finds a sample of Melissa's blood and it indicates she is pregnant. Walker realizes her death occurred later that night, and he decides to stop it. After going back to Fielding's room, he discovers that she has been murdered and he is framed as the prime suspect.He goes to the mall where he and Melissa met that night. Eventually, Max Walker finds her and manages to convince her he is from the future. He also sees the three thugs who attacked him and realizes that they are McComb's men whom were sent back to kill him before he joined the TEC.That evening, McComb's thugs break into Walker's home, like before, only this time the older Walker is waiting for them. Without his younger self realizing it, the older Walker helps to fight off the bad guys. Together, they and Melissa win, though the younger Walker is wounded. The 2004 McComb then takes Melissa hostage. When the older Walker finds McComb is holding Melissa, the corrupt senator then sets a time bomb. He then shoots Melissa, just before the young McComb appears, having been tricked into coming to the house by a fake message from Walker. Walker grabs the young McComb and pushes him into the older one, causing them to become a writhing, screaming mass which melts into nothingness (since according to the time theory, no two persons can exist by physically touching each other).Walker carries the wounded Melissa out of the house just before the bomb explodes, destroying the house just like before. He lays the unconscious Melissa beside his younger self and leaves the scene before the local police and fire department arrives. Walker returns to 2004, and the time-line has been corrected. The TEC still exists, Fielding and Matuzak are alive, and McComb does not exist, having ""vanished"" ten years earlier. As Walker returns home, he is happily shocked to find himself living in the same house which was rebuilt. Melissa is alive and their nine-year-old son is waiting to greet him. As Walker walks into the house for dinner Melissa has something to announce to Walker... implying that she is pregnant again."

City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109439/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"One year after their first adventure, Mitch Robbins and his friends discover a treasure map that belonged to their late trail guide Curly and they set out to discover its secrets. City Slickers II begins after the death of Curly. It is Mitch Robbins' 40th birthday and the day is going quite well, until he returns home (after a working at the radio station) and finds his brother Glen, the black sheep of the family, on his sofa. Mitch is about to have a nice birthday-night with his wife when he discovers a treasure map of Curly's by chance. Together with Phil (from the first film) and unfortunately also having to put up with Glen, he tries to find the hidden gold of Curly's father in the desert of Arizona instead of attending a meeting in Las Vegas. The adventurous journey reveals many surprises until everything seems to be over when the map gets lost.—Volker Boehm Unable to shake off the feeling that he might have made a terrible mistake, neurotic urbanite Mitch Robbins is about to have a rendezvous with fate after an unexpected discovery. Now, one short year after the life-changing events ofCity Slickers (1991), Mitch summons up the courage to sneak off from a Las Vegas business convention, and armed with late Curly's genuine treasure map, embarks on an exciting mission to unearth the hidden gold along with Phil and Glen, his layabout younger brother. Of course, this is easier said than done. Will the three prospectors from the big city strike it lucky?—Nick Riganas The movie opens with Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal), back in Colorado, riding a white stallion to visit deceased trail boss Curly's grave. Mitch thanks Curly for the time they spent together and says that he truly changed his life. Just then, Curly (Jack Palance) rises from his grave and drags down Mitch who screams until he awakens in his New Rochelle home, realizing it was just a nightmare. He soon forgets the bad dream when the phone rings and it is Mitch's yearly call from his mother who retells the story of his birth and wishes him a happy 40th birthday. Unlike his 39th birthday, Mitch's outlook on life has changed drastically in the last year as he welcomes his 40th one with open arms. His wife, Barbara (Patricia Wettig), informs Mitch that after his birthday dinner, she made arrangements for them to have the whole house for themselves and advises her husband to save up all the energy he can because he will need it.Ever since he returned from his cattle drive adventures the previous year, Mitch has made quite a few changes to his life which now makes him much happier. He moved his family out of the city, kept Norman the calf who is now all grown up and has made a lot of progress at work which lead him to get promoted to station manager.Going into work, he meets his best friend Phil Berquist (Daniel Stern), who Mitch has recently employed at the station. Unlike Mitch, Phil's life has not gotten better over the last year. He got washed up in his ugly divorce with his ex-wife Arlene and now suffers from loneliness to the point where he considers trying to get back with Arlene, which Mitch equates to a criminal willingly checking himself back into Alcatraz prison. To help him out of his funk, Mitch invites Phil over for his birthday dinner with his family.On the train ride back home, Mitch swears he sees Curly on the train but it turns out to be a stranger that just looks like him. The nightmare and the vision lead Mitch to wonder aloud if Curly was truly dead when they buried him but Phil believes that Mitch is just seeing things, since they checked Curly and confirmed he was dead before burying him.When they arrive home, Mitch is shocked to find his younger brother Glen (Jon Lovitz) has arrived unexpectedly. Mitch has a strained relationship with his brother because he is mostly immature, irresponsible, keeps borrowing money from everyone without ever returning it, moves from one relative to another without an invitation until he gets thrown out, and has an irritating fixation on the Godfather trilogy. Seeing how Barbara is already irritated by Glen's presence and wanting to be alone with his wife, Mitch arranges for Glen to leave with Phil after dinner.Finally alone with Barbara, Mitch, looking to role play for his wife puts on Curly's hat and feels something poking him. He then finds a piece of paper, with a missing corner, hidden inside the hat that looks like a treasure map supposed to lead to one million dollars worth of gold bullion and dated from 1908. Interrupted by his wife, Mitch hides the map but then sees Curly staring at him from outside his window and screams.The next day, back at work, Mitch tells Phil that he saw Curly again but when he went outside he had disappeared. Phil questions Mitch as to why Curly would travel all the way to New Rochelle and Mitch reveals the map he found in Curly's hat. Interrupted by Glen, Phil takes the map and heads to the library to do some research. Meanwhile, Glen inquires as to why Phil has a job at the station but not him since he asked Mitch for a job a few months ago. Mitch reveals he doesn't trust Glen since he pulled some strings in the past to get him a job and Glen never bothered to show up. Glen is deeply hurt and leaves but Mitch convinces him to come with him and Phil to a Las Vegas business convention they are attending over the upcoming weekend where Glen might make business connections of his own.Mitch then joins Phil at the library where they analyze the map and surmise that it belonged to Lincoln Washburn who robbed a Western Pacific train carrying gold back in 1908. Quick calculations tell them that one million dollars worth of gold back in 1908 would now be worth about 20 million dollars (in 1994). They also find that the trail starts not far away from Las Vegas where they happen to be going in just a few days. Mitch is reluctant to pursue the treasure or even believe it exists until they find a picture of Lincoln Washburn and realize he was obviously Curly's father. Having already invited Glen for the weekend, Mitch decides to let him in on the treasure and offers him to join them. He also lies to his wife about missing out the convention and potentially jeopardizing his career.The three of them rent horses and supplies from store owners to whom Mitch tries to lie about their motives but quickly finds out Phil has already told them everything. Following the awkward encounter, the three of them head out to find the treasure.After being lost for a moment, they find the very first indicator that the map is real when they find a rock formation that looks like a hand pointing the way just like the map says. However, their excitement is short lived when Glen accidentally sets fire to the map and Mitch almost falls off a cliff to retrieve it. Fortunately, Glen only burned a small hole and they are able to continue their journey. Mitch decides to draw a copy of the map in case of another accident and give it to Phil which causes an argument because Glen whines about his brother not trusting him again. Mitch then gives the copy to Glen.The next day, Phil stops for a bathroom break. As he's squatting, he feels a painful sting on his butt. When he turns around, he finds a rattlesnake and believes he was just bitten. Thinking he is about to die, having heard a horror story from the store owners earlier, he pleads with his friends to suck out the poison. After a short argument, Mitch prepares himself mentally and is about to do it when he finds a cactus spine embedded in Phil's butt cheek. Phil gets emotional when he realizes what his best friend was willing to do to save him. The journey resumes and soon they find more road indicators featured on the map letting them know they're on the right path.As they're having a lunch break, they are interrupted by the store owners who show up with guns to steal the map. They surrender the copy of the map and the store owner ties them up. Just as they're poised to kill them however, a familiar face appears and fights them off. Mitch assumes his thoughts that Curly was not dead are correct, but their savior is actually Duke (Jack Palance), Curly's identical twin brother. Duke reveals he was indeed on the train and outside Mitch's house that night. He explains that long ago, their father had plans to find the gold with his sons once he was no longer being monitored, but he died before it could happen and without ever telling his sons about the map. On her death bed, a year ago, their mother gave Curly the map, and he contacted Duke to come find him so that they could seek the gold together, but he then died shortly after. Duke learned from Curly's friend Cookie that Mitch had taken Curly's belongings, and so sought him out to get the map and claim his family's treasure. Duke then asks for the map but Glen tells him the store owners took it from them. Fortunately, Mitch reveals they took a copy of the map that will only lead them to the closest highway, which causes another row with Glen, and gives the real map to Duke. Duke takes the map and sends them away, intending to find the treasure on his own much to their disappointment. In a moment of courage, Mitch chastises Duke for his attitude, reasoning that Curly would not approve. Mitch explains that Curly was a friend and how Curly explained his philosophy about life ('One thing, just one thing'). Surprised that Curly told Mitch about his ""one thing"" philosophy, Duke realizes Mitch was someone Curly must've liked. Out of respect for Curly's memory, Duke agrees to let Mitch, Phil and Glen join him, provided that Duke gets half and the three of them have to split the other half amongst themselves.On the road, Duke reveals that, while Curly was in love with the land and cattle driving, he was in love with the sea and spent most of his life in the Navy and then working on all kinds of ships and boats, having traveled the world several times . As they're riding, Mitch sees a wild white stallion just like the one he rode in his dream. Feeling he should ride with it, Mitch chases it for a while until he's able to touch it, feeling elated from the experience. Unfortunately, the scared stallion soon returns with a whole mob of wild horses and Mitch and his friends get caught up in a stampede which destroys most of their supplies and equipment. Mitch is able to save Glen's life which draws them closer. However, Duke reveals that the stampede caused him to loose the map. It also destroyed Mitch's cell phone which guarantees Barbara is about to find out Mitch did not go to the business convention. Things seem grim until Glen tells the others that due to his photographic memory, he's able to recall the last part of the map. With no other choice but trusting Glen or heading back to Las Vegas, Mitch decides to give Glen a chance and the group resume their journey.That night, they get caught up in a cold storm. Out of matches and supplies, the men are desperate to keep warm and not freeze to death when Phil suggests they cuddle together to share their body warmth. Mitch invites Duke to join them but he adamantly refuses. Duke then asks Mitch if Curly ever spoke about him to which Mitch has to admit he never did. Duke then asks if Curly died happy which Mitch confirms he died doing what he loved best. Duke then reveals he had not seen Curly for a very long time but is still sad to have lost his brother. He then reveals that he lost his boat two years ago and have been working at a seafood restaurant impersonating a happy pirate which he absolutely hates. The reason he is so passionate about finding the gold is because it would allow him to retire at sea, his one last dream.The next morning, having survived the cold, Duke pulls a prank on Mitch by pretending to have died just like Curly. He then shows Mitch that Glen was right about the last part of the map as he can see the ""buffalo's back"" and the ""frozen people"" Glen was recalling from the map. They find a cave and, after a little fright and more shenanigans, they find a chest filled with gold bullion. As they're celebrating their discovery, they find themselves set upon by bandits. A fight ensues and Glen gets shot while trying to save Mitch. However, Duke soon realizes the bullets were blanks with paint pellets. Just then, another familiar face shows up: Clay Stone (Noble Willingham), who was in charge of the cattle drive ranch where Curly worked and where Mitch and his friends went the year before.Clay reveals that the gold is just lead covered in gold paint and the bandits are actually his sons acting their part. He explains that he invested in one of Curly's idea to take tourists out on a western treasure hunt adventure. The tourists were given printed copies of a similar map Curly had in his hat. Stone also reveals that Curly used to come to the same cave often but never found anything, hence why he allowed Stone to copy the map. Duke inquires as to why Curly would tell him they would get rich to which Clay Stone explains that the endeavor promised to be quite lucrative and Curly wanted to give Duke a piece of the action. The four men are quite brokenhearted that their whole journey turned out to be fake and they were dumb enough to believe it, especially Duke.With nothing left to find, Duke thanks Mitch for being Curly's last friend and parts ways with the three men, having decided to keep looking for the gold. Before he leaves, he reveals he never understood Curly's ""one thing"" philosophy, which Mitch explains. Mitch, Phil and Glen then reflect on their adventure and realize they are quite proud of what they've accomplished even though the treasure was not real. They did it on their own, without luxuries, and they all found true values in themselves as they all tried to save each other's life at one point or another. Mitch tells Glen he is proud of him for the first time in his life which draws the brothers even closer.Mitch returns to Las Vegas, preparing for a night of trying to reconcile with his wife after having explained everything to her. However, he is surprised when Duke shows up in his hotel room. Duke reveals he finally found his ""one thing"" in life and it is honesty. He reveals he was planning to cheat Mitch, Phil and Glen out of the gold all along but found himself unable to. He then reveals a secret he had purportedly kept from the other three: the map that Curly had, which was also used as a tourist attraction, had a corner missing. Duke then provides the missing corner, revealing that his mom had given the map to Curly but had taken out the last part and sent it to Duke to make sure the brothers would have to reunite if they ever wanted to seek the treasure. The missing piece reveals that, in 1909, Lincoln Washburn had relocated the treasure further away into the mountains where Curly's map stopped. Mitch thinks that Duke is just messing with him, until Duke produces a solid gold bar...the real thing. He then adds: ""It's got friends!"" Mitch and Duke starts singing ""come and get me"" as the two celebrate having found the real treasure."
Beverly Hills Cop III,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109254/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Axel Foley, while investigating a car theft ring, comes across something much bigger than that: the same men who killed his boss are running a counterfeit money ring out of a theme park in Los Angeles. After a botched attempt to make a bust in a Detroit chop shop, the effectively unorthodox police officer, Axel Foley, once more, finds himself in sunny Beverly Hills, hot on the trail of an elusive gang of cold-blooded killers. There--with the aid of old friends, Serge, the recently promoted Billy Rosewood, and his partner Jon Flint--Axel searches out the criminals' hideout which is nestled right under everyone's face: in Southern California's bustling theme park, WonderWorld. Now, all that's left to do is to convince the people and the police that the park's impeccable chief of security, Ellis DeWald, is a ruthless villain, and that the immaculate amusement park is, in reality, a graceful and impenetrable facade for a sinister operation. How hard can it be?—Nick Riganas One night in Detroit, Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) plans to arrest a gang of car thieves who run a local chop shop. Unbeknownst to his boss, Inspector G. Douglas Todd (Gil Hill), Axel has canceled the SWAT, intending to raid the shop using only his team. Meanwhile, a group of men arrive at the chop shop to pick up a cube van that the car thieves had hijacked. The leader of the group confirms that the vehicle still contains its cargo, which consists of crates labelled as property of the U.S. government, then has his men execute the car thieves.As the murderers are about to leave, Axel, unaware of what has happened inside, proceeds with his plan to enter the shop and quickly finds his team outgunned. Todd, arriving moments later, is fatally shot by the group's leader. As the perpetrators escapes in the cube van, an angry Foley gives chase in one of the partially disassembled cars from the shop, but is prevented from continuing the chase by Secret Service Agent Steve Fulbright (Stephen McHattie). Fulbright informs Axel that the killer must remain on the loose because the federal government is pursuing a larger scheme in which he is involved.After Todd's funeral, Axel learns that several clues left behind by the killers point to Wonder World, a theme park in Beverly Hills, California owned by ""Uncle"" Dave Thorton (Alan Young). Axel arrives in Beverly Hills and reunites with his friend Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), who has been promoted to ""Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command"" (DDO-JSIOC), and meets Billy's new partner, Jon Flint (Héctor Elizondo). It is revealed that John Taggart is now retired and is living in Phoenix, Arizona. Axel asks Flint to call his friend Ellis DeWald (Timothy Carhart), the head of Wonder World's park security, to let him know that he's coming to the park for his investigation.Axel meets and befriends Janice Perkins (Theresa Randle) whilst touring the park's behind-the-scenes facilities. Later, he is spotted by security, shot at and attacked hand-to-hand. Foley retreats to the surface where he cuts in line to enter the Spider Ferris wheel ride. The guards accidentally jam the ride, placing two little kids' lives in danger. Axel rescues them and is subsequently taken to park manager Orrin Sanderson (John Saxon). When DeWald is called in to contest the claim that Axel was attacked by the security men without prior challenge, Axel immediately recognizes DeWald as Todd's killer, but Rosewood and Flint refuse to believe that claim because DeWald is keeping an impeccable public reputation.However, Axel is later visited by Uncle Dave and Janice, who inform him that the Wonder World park's designer and Dave's close friend, Roger Fry, has mysteriously disappeared while inspecting the grounds two weeks ago, leaving only a letter with a cryptic message. He tries to heckle DeWald into revealing his criminal involvements, despite continued admonishments by Agent Fulbright, but DeWald proves too smooth to be caught in a mistake. When Axel later digs deeper into a closed-off section of the park, he finds out that DeWald and Sanderson run a counterfeiting ring that uses Wonder World as a front, and DeWald was at the chop shop in Detroit to get his hands on blank printing paper used for American currency. Axel later meets with Uncle Dave to ask him about further details to find a piece of viable evidence, and thereby discovers that Fry's warning letter is actually written on a sheet of the stolen mint paper. Before he can make use of that evidence, however, Uncle Dave is shot by DeWald, and Axel is framed for his shooting.After getting away from DeWald and bringing Uncle Dave to the next hospital, Axel sets out to prove his innocence by storming the park, calling Rosewood and Flint to assist him. The resulting shootout kills DeWald's henchmen, and after a hand-to-hand fight Axel shoots and kills DeWald. Agent Fulbright appears to explain that he was wrong, but Axel realizes his actual involvement with the counterfeiter and shoots him during a brief struggle. Uncle Dave makes a full recovery, and he thanks Axel for his assistance by creating a new character for Wonder World in his honor, Axel Fox."

He is often at odds with Carl Roebuck (Bruce Willis), a local contractor, suing him at every opportunity for unpaid wages and disability. Sully's one-legged lawyer Wirf Wirfley (Gene Saks) is inept, and his lawsuits are repeatedly dismissed. As a way to irritate him, Sully flirts with Carl's wife Toby (Melanie Griffith) openly at every opportunity (which she enjoys). He is a regular at the Iron Horse Saloon, where he often has drinks and plays cards with Wirf, Carl, Rub, and the town sheriff.A running joke is the repeated theft of Carl's snowblower. Sully steals it to get back at Carl for his latest failed lawsuit. Carl steals it back, placing it in the yard at his construction business guarded by his doberman pinscher guard dog. Sully, after drugging the dog, steals it a second time. Carl takes it back a final time, and leaves the dog, who is now skittish due to his drugging, at Sully's childhood home for him to find.Sully is a tenant in the home of the elderly Miss Beryl Peoples (Jessica Tandy), whose banker son Clive Peoples Jr. (Josef Sommer) strongly urges her to kick him out and sell the house. Family complications of his own develop for Sully with a visit from Peter (Dylan Walsh), his estranged son who is an unemployed college professor at odds with his wife. While Peter and Sully try to reconstruct their relationship, Sully begins a new one with his young grandson Will (Alexander Goodwin). Peter's sudden everyday presence does not sit well with Rub, but Sully tells him that although Peter is his son, Rub is still his best friend.Meanwhile, Clive is on the verge of a lucrative deal to build an amusement park in North Bath. However, the deal unexpectedly falls through when the promoter turns out to be a con man, and Clive quietly skips town in shame since he used his bank's resources to help finance the amusement park.After being jailed for punching a police officer named Raymer (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who has been persecuting him, Sully's luck seems to be all bad. But his son, Peter, bails him out of jail and both him and Sully's grandson start to warm up to him.Sully later attends the funeral of an elderly resident named Ms. Hattie (Alice Drummond), an Alzheimer's stricken elderly woman whom he frequently sees wondering the streets of the town in a daze and whom Sully always helps walk her back to her house where her children are caring for her her.Soon, Sully's fortune takes a turn for the better when his horse racing trifecta ticket wins a some of a few thousand dollars. Even the lovely Toby expresses a willingness to leave Carl, mostly due to his constant womanizing, and run away with Sully to Hawaii. Sully realizes he can't leave his grandson and thanks Toby for considering him, just before she leaves for the airport.In the final scene, Sully is pretty much back where he began, boarding at Miss Beryl's. But now he is a little richer, both financially and in his soul, he's a new dog owner, and he has become the picture of contentment."

Forrest Taft (Steven Seagal) is an environmental Agent who works for the Aegis Oil Company in Alaska. Aegis Oil's corrupt C.E.O., Michael Jennings (Sir Michael Caine), is the kind of person who doesn't care whether or not oil spills into the ocean or onto the land, just as long as it's making money for him. He even makes commercials that make him look like he cares about the environment. Jennings is almost finished with building his new state-of-the art oil rig: AEGIS-1. The problem is that if he doesn't finish building the rig in thirteen days, the land rights will be returned to the Eskimos and the Alaskan Government. When Jennings finds out that Taft's best friend Hugh Palmer (Richard Hamilton) has a computer disk that contains information about defective equipment on AEGIS-1, he sends out his goons to murder Palmer. When Taft tries to interfere, Jennings tries to kill Taft. But an Eskimo woman named Masu (Joan Chen), who introduces Taft to her father Silook (Chief Irvin Brink), the Chief of her tribe, rescues Taft. With Masu's help, Taft begins a trek through the Alaskan wilderness, heading straight for AEGIS-1 and to destroy it before it destroys all of the forest.—drayj65 <drayj65@hotmail.com> In the beautiful wilderness of Alaska, a fire is raging at an Aegis Oil Rig owned by corrupt oil baron Michael Jennings (Michael Caine) CEO of Aegis Oil Co. Foreman Hugh Palmer (Richard Hamilton) barks at his men to fight the fire. A helicopter flies up and tall, buckskin wearing legend, Forrest Taft (Steven Seagal) who puts out the fire with a set of explosions which deprive the fire of the oxygen it is using. As Jennings and Taft fly off in a company helicopter, Jennings complains about what a pain in the rear the environmentalists will be now that a fire has broken out on his oil rig, and blames Hugh for the issue. Taft reassures him that, ""I kind of blew up all the evidence,"" to which Jennings agrees and grins.That night at a bar, Hugh Palmer comes to Taft and asks him to do him a favor in going into the company's archives to check the safety reports of the oil rig to help prove Hugh's innocence. Taft, starting to believe there is something fishy going on with Jennings' work, agrees hesitantly. He then overhears a busty jerk oil worker say racist remarks to a native American in the bar before assaulting him. Taft intercedes and a fight breaks out between him and the racist and the racist's buddies. He brutally beats them all down and then beats the racist into a bloody pulp, smashing his nose before convincing him to change his ways, essentially beating some sense into him.The next day, Jennings puts on an environmental commercial being very uncomfortable about it and barking at anyone and everyone in his way. He then discusses business with his secretary Liles (Shari Shattuck) and vicious right-hand man MacGruder (John C. McGinley). It is revealed that in 13 days, the Aegis oil company will lose their contract to the ground that Jennings desperately wants to pump oil from, ""Meaning millions of dollars a week."" The rights will then revert back to the Eskimos if Aegis does not reach the rights in time. At the rig, Aegis 1, Taft checks the computers and sends Hugh the information he has been asking for. MacGruder observes this and Jennings sends him to find the information Hugh has been gathering. MacGruder and a fellow man go to Hugh's home where Hugh is downloading the data sent to him of the rigs' bad conditions. When Hugh refuses to give the records and pipe tally books up, they torture him by smashing each and every one of his fingers with a whale bone before castrating him with a pipe cutter. Hugh is tortured and killed, refusing to give up his information.Taft begins to question Jennings' means and asks him ""How much money is enough"" bringing to his attention that he knows of the rig's bad compositions and unsafe procedures that will cause much damage to the environment while making Jennings richer. Jennings does not respond and asks Taft to do one last job before answering his question. Taft is brought to an abandoned oil refinery in Alaska where he finds the dismembered corpse of Hugh shortly before the building explodes, revealing that Jennings had set it up to kill Taft. The explosion sends Taft flying into the air where he is injured from the explosion.Later, a tribe of Eskimos find him and bring him back to their village where they nurse him back to health and call him a ""Bear"" that will rescue Mother Earth from the evil oil barons. He is skeptical at first and even tries to escape only to be stopped by their dogs. He is confronted by them of his actions and explains that people are coming after him and that he is putting them in danger. He becomes acquainted with the Chief Silook (Chief Irvin Brink) and his beautiful daughter Masu (Joan Chen) who bring him to a river where he undergoes a spiritual journey via dream vision. He first sees a female orgy, and then kills a bear (Bart the Bear) and then is forced to choose between a beautiful naked woman and a fully clothed old woman, for which he chooses the latter (the old one). The woman tells him of how mother Nature is being hurt by the oil rigs and shows him water that is transforming into oil. He awakens from the dream, now determined to take down Aegis.MacGruder and his force storm the tribal camp, believing Taft is there but cannot find him. In a brief scuffle, MacGruder shoots and mortally wounds Silook before fleeing. Silook dies peacefully of his wounds after telling Taft that Taft is the warrior that will save them all.

They are attacked by MacGruder's men which Taft swiftly dispatches. He is hunted through the forest by a team of mercenaries led by Stone (R. Lee Ermey) who they outrun. Taft and Masu reach a friend's home where Taft supplies himself with his friend's arsenal of weaponry.Masu tries to convince him not to fight back with violence but he rebuffs her (negating everything he learned in his ""spiritual journey"") Taft realizes that the oil rigs pump toxins back into the earth, hurting nature even more. He then concludes that they must go and blow up Aegis 1 in order to prevent another ecological disaster (Sure, it would.) That night Taft, with Masu following behind for no reasons, breaks into Aegis rig and kills many oil workers. He sets the preventers to implode to ""prevent an oil spill"" and sets up C-4. MacGruder attempts to escape with Liles on a helicopter but Taft stops him and disables the chopper. MacGruder tries to plea bargain but Taft flings him into the rotor headfirst, decapitating him. Liles attempts to drive off but smashes into a oil pipe and explodes.Taft blows apart Stone with a shotgun and then confronts Jennings who is trying to keep the rig running. He berates Jennings before tying him upside down over the oil tank. Jennings taunts him to shoot him but Taft instead shoots the cord binding him, dropping Jennings down into the oil, leaving him to drown. Taft and Masu escape as the rig explodes.The film ends with Taft giving a speech about how evil oil companies are and how in pain the world is by how humans prioritize money over the environment, despite having no proof to back up his claims. He is then blessed by a medicine man who says, ""The earth is our grandmother.""In a mid-credits scene, Taft and Masu canoe out to a middle of a lake. Masu smiles at Taft, who looks up and sees the proud spirit of Silook flying overhead in the form of a raven."

Nell,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110638/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a remote woodland cabin, a small-town doctor discovers Nell - a beautiful young hermit-woman with many secrets. Nell is a girl who's been brought up in an isolated world. The only people she knew were her mother and twin sister, Mae. They lived together in a cottage in the forest. Nobody has ever met Nell. After her mother's death, she's discovered by Jerome, the local doctor. He's fascinated by her, since she speaks a mangled language, developed by her and Mae growing up, ""twin speak"" if you will. But Paula, a psychology student, wants her observed in a laboratory. The judge decides they get three months to observe her in the forest, after which he'll decide about her future.—Tony Kessen <rhkessen@cs.vu.nl> Nell is raised in the remote backwoods of North Carolina with her mother and twin sister, Mae, never having met anyone else. When her mother dies, she must confront the outside world. Due to her isolation she never learned proper English, only a mangled form. Nice country doctor Jerome Lovell wants to help her adjust in her own protected surroundings, while psychology student Paula Olsen and her heartless boss, Alexander Paley, want to study her in their laboratory. But how long can her world remain isolated?—Reid Gagle Nell is a young woman whose upbringing has been in the sheltered, isolated woods with her mother whose speech is impaired (supposedly by srokes?) and her twin sister who has passed away, it is thought, some 12 or more years ago. As a result, Nell's own speech is a rather mangled mixture of ""twin speech"" and learning from her mother's own impaired manner of speaking. When her mother dies & is found by a teenage boy who it appears is delivering food, Nell is discovered by the local doctor. Dr. Jerome Lovell is intrigued by Nell & begins a journey of discovering how she has come to be this ""feral"" or wild child. He surmises from a newspaper clipping found in the cabin that Nell's mother was raped; from Nell's fear of going out in day time that she's been taught to stay out of sight & from her description of ""e'al do'ers"" (evildoers) that the reason for this is to avoid being raped as her mother was.
Nell looks in the mirror and ""spee's"" (speaks) to her deceased twin sister, Mae (Mary?) and dreams of running through the forest & playing with her when they were young. Memories of Mae seem to be a great comfort to Nell.
The female psychologist that Dr. Lovell had come out to observe Nell wants to study her in a laboratory setting, and her boss, a noted psychiatrist, pushes for this to happen, but Dr. Lovell objects & at court, a judge decides to give 3 months for observation of Nell in her own surroundings to see if she is competent to give ""informed consent"" to be studied.
As Dr. Lovell, who moves into a tent a short distance from Nell's forest cabin, begins to interact with Nell...she subsequently comes to trust him and refers to him as her ""gah-anj"" (later Lovell determines this to mean ""guardian angel"") and calls him ""Jay"" in her way of saying Jerry.
The psychologist, Paula Olsen, has also come out to observe, living in a lab-funded houseboat. She has sneaked in and put a video camera in Nell's cabin so she can watch her without the personal interaction. (it's unclear if this the sole intent or if it is just ""easier"" to do this way)
Eventually, outsiders inadvertently learn of Nell & a journalist makes his way to Nell's cabin & frightens her with his flash photography, which Nell has never seen of course. Jerry runs him off but a story comes out in the newspaper & soon a helicopter arrives, frightening Nell to the point of collapse. In an effort to shield her from gratuitous exposure to ruthless media, Paula, who now sees Nell as a real person who is sweet & needs no state intervention and Jerry decide the only place she can be safe from the press is at the hospital where Paula's boss wants to make a lab rat out of her.
The arrival at the scary hospital along with the traumatic fleeing from media helicopter shocks Nell into a catatonic state which both doctors know will send her directly to an institution when her 3-month evaluation comes up. Jerry impulsively breaks out of the hospital with Nell & holes up in a hotel where she continues to refuse to speak or interact with him. At one point, Nell is alone on the balcony outside the hotel room door looking down into the neglected pool and daydreams of Mae. This scene seems to imply that Nell is suicidal, but that is never made clear.
Finally at the competency hearing, Jerry becomes frustrated at how Nell is being ""railroaded"", knowing how she really is, and Nell suddenly ""comes alive"" and seems to come to Jerry's defense by basically explaining herself, asking Jerry to ""spee' fo' Nell"". The things she says and emotions she expresses are very beautiful & the movie ends with Jerry & Paula driving with their young daughter to a gathering of some sort at Nell's cabin, where there are quite a few other people including the sheriff and his wife, who are fond of Nell throughout the film as well. Nell has a scene with the young daughter, teaching her the chant she and Mae used to say and telling her ""You 'member dat""...
I love this movie, even if it is a bit far-fetched. The scenery is breathtaking and the emotions are beautiful & ultimately, the ""moral""... leave well enough alone... is appealing to me."

Based on the 1930s pulp fiction and radio drama series, this movie pits the hero against his arch enemy, Shiwan Khan (John Lone), who plans to take over the world by holding a city ransom using an atomic bomb. Using his powers of invisibility and ""The power to cloud men's minds"", The Shadow (Alec Baldwin) comes blazing to the city's rescue with explosive results.—Michael Ross <M.I.Ross-iy1i9893@lmu.ac.uk> In Tibet, following the First World War, an American named Lamont Cranston (Alec Baldwin), has become a warlord and opium kingpin under the alias of Ying-Ko (Mandarin Chinese for ""Dark Eagle""). One night, he is abducted by servants of The Tulku (Barry Dennen), a holy man who exhibits otherworldly powers and knows Cranston's true identity. He offers Cranston a chance to redeem himself and become a force for good. Cranston arrogantly refuses but is silenced by the Phurba, a mystical sentient flying dagger. Ultimately Cranston remains under the tutelage of the Tulku for seven years. In addition to undergoing rigorous physical training, he learns mind control abilities such as hypnotism, mind reading, telekinesis and to bend people's perception so that he cannot be seen - except for his shadow.After completing his training, Cranston returns to New York City where he portrays himself as a lazy, laid back, millionaire playboy, while secretly operating as The Shadow, a vigilante who terrorizes the city's criminals. He then recruits the people he saves to act as his agents, providing him with useful information and specialist knowledge. His most trusted agent is Moe, a taxi driver who, after being saved by The Shadow, has dedicated himself to assist him in any way he can, most notably acting as Cranston's chauffeur and driving him anywhere and anytime he calls. He alone, knows the true identity of The Shadow. Cranston also regularly has dinner with his uncle, Police Captain Wainwright Barth (Jonathan Winters), who provides him with information and insights about police affairs, unable to imagine that his lazy nephew could ever be The Shadow.But Cranston's secret identity is endangered upon meeting Margo Lane (Penelope Ann Miller), a socialite who also have strong telepathic abilities, although she has no control over them. For some reason, Lamont is unable to shield his mind from her as she's able to read him with ease. Something that scares him more than he is ready to admit.Meanwhile, Shiwan Khan (John Lone), arrives in New-York concealed in Genghis Khan's sarcophagus. Upon his arrival, he uses hypnosis to make a security guard shoot himself and make a taxi driver crash his cab straight into a fuel truck.
Khan easily finds Cranston's secret lair and reveals that he was a disciple of the Tulku as well. Khan is the last descendant of Genghis Khan, and he plans to fulfill his family's legacy of world domination. He reveals to Cranston that he is a huge fan of his Ying-Ko persona and offers him an alliance, but Cranston refuses. Khan leaves for now, offering Cranston time to think about his proposition. Cranston then acquires a rare coin from Khan and soon learns that it is made of a metal called ""bronzium"" (an impure form of uranium) that theoretically could generate an atomic explosion. He then learns that Margo's father, Reinhardt Lane (Ian McKellen), a scientist who just happens to be working on building an atomic device for the Department of War, has begun acting very strange and can now speak Chinese all of a sudden. Cranston realizes that Khan may be targeting Reinhardt and his invention to build an atomic bomb and makes his way to the federal building while changing into The Shadow. Unfortunately, he fails to stop Khan's henchmen from taking possession of the device and Reinhardt in the process.Shiwan Khan then hypnotizes Margo and commands her to kill the Shadow. She goes to Cranston's home and shoots him, not realizing she was shooting at a mirror. Cranston breaks Khan's hold on her but she remembers exactly why she came over. She accurately deduces that since she was ordered to kill the Shadow and she instinctively went to Cranston's home, that he is The Shadow. Cranston asks her to leave before leaving the house himself. Cranston follows one of Khan's man and finds him having a meal in a restaurant. He confronts Khan about the murder attempt and confirms he will not be an ally in Khan's plans. Khan then reveals he's in possession of the Phurba and used it to kill the Tulku. Both man pulls out a gun and tries to shoot the other but their bullets hits each other in mid air.

What could possibly go wrong?—grantss Last season, the Cleveland Indians won the division title, but they were defeated in the American League championship series (ALCS) by the Chicago White Sox. The success of last season has changed the attitudes of the Indians. Pitching sensation Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn is now a yuppie who feels like he's lost his edge on his fastball. Homerun hitter Pedro Cerrano underwent a spiritual conversion, from aggressive voodoo to placid Buddhism, and his batting has declined. Roger Dorn retired and has replaced Rachel Phelps as the owner of the team. Catcher Jake Taylor has also retired to become one of the coaches who work for manager Lou Brown. Willie Mays Hayes is still as fast as ever, but he has added some power to his hitting. The Indians get off to another slow start, then Roger makes a big move by signing arrogant power hitting catcher Jack Parkman, who is a bully. Also, minor league catcher Rube Baker is called up to the Indians, even though Rube has a throwing problem. The signing of Jack Parkman has put Roger in a financially tough spot, so Roger later trades Jack to the Chicago White Sox, the team that stopped the Indians from going to the World Series last season. In return, the Indians have received left fielder Isuro Tanaka, who is a gifted fielder. Roger then sells the team back to Rachel Phelps, because Roger needs the money. Rachel sees this as an opportunity to get revenge on the Indians for what happened last season, so she tries to find ways to make them have a losing season this time. When Lou suffers a heart attack, he convinces Jake to take over as the Indians' substitute manager. Jake leads the Indians to their second consecutive division title, and another shot at the ALCS and their opponents are again the Chicago White Sox.

Eventually, Andrew achieves his ends on his own terms.—Reid Gagle Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and her secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realizes there is something deep inside your body that people can't touch or get to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red, and Andy epitomizes why it is crucial to have dreams. His spirit and determination lead us into a world full of imagination, one filled with courage and desire. Will Andy ever realize his dreams?—Andy Haque In 1947, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker in Maine, is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, a golf pro. Since the state of Maine has no death penalty, he is given two consecutive life sentences and sent to the notoriously harsh Shawshank Prison. Andy keeps claiming his innocence, but his cold and calculating demeanor leads everyone to believe he did it.Meanwhile, Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), known as Red is being interviewed for parole after having spent 20 years at Shawshank for murder. Despite his best efforts and behavior, Red's parole is rejected which doesn't phase him all that much. Red is then introduced as the local smuggler who can get inmates anything they want within reason. An alarm goes off alerting all prisoners of new arrivals. Red and his friends bet on whichever new fish will have a nervous break down during his first night in prison. Red places a huge bet on Andy.During the first night, an overweight newly arrived inmate, nicknamed ''fat ass', breaks down and cries hysterically allowing Heywood (William Sadler) to win the bet. However, the celebration is short lived when the chief guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), savagely beats up the fat man for not keeping quiet when he is asked to. Meanwhile, Andy remains steadfast and composed. The next morning, the inmates learn that ''fat ass'' died in the infirmary because the prison doctor had been out for the night. Andy inquires about the man's name only to get put down by Heywood.About a month later, Andy approaches Red having heard of his talents for finding things. He asks Red to find him a rock hammer, an instrument he claims is necessary for his hobby of rock collecting and sculpting. Red asks a few questions about his intentions which Andy laughs off. Red agrees to place the order and also warns Andy about ''the sisters'', a group of prisoners who sexually assaults other prisoners, most importantly their leader, Boggs (Mark Rolston) who has a crush on Andy. Though other prisoners consider Andy ""a really cold fish,"" Red sees something in Andy, and likes him from the start. Red thinks Andy intends to use the hammer to engineer an escape in the future but when he finally sees the tool's actual size, he understands why Andy laughed and laughs too, putting aside the thought that Andy could ever use it to dig his way out of prison.During the first two years of his incarceration, Andy spends most of his time working in the prison laundry or fighting off Boggs and the Sisters. Though he persistently resists and fights them every time, Andy is beaten and raped on a regular basis but keeps quiet about it.When a work detail for tarring the roof of one of the prison's buildings is announced, Red pulls some strings to get Andy and a few of their mutual friends assigned to the job, giving everyone a break from the usual. During the job Andy overhears Hadley complaining about having to pay taxes for an upcoming inheritance. Drawing from his expertise as a banker, Andy lets Hadley know how he can shelter his money from the IRS by turning it into a one-time gift for his wife. He then offers to assist Hadley in filling out the paperwork in exchange for some cold beers for his fellow inmates while on the tarring job. Hadley first threatens to throw Andy off the roof, but eventually agrees and do provide the working inmates with cold beers before the job is finished. Red remarks that Andy may have engineered the privilege to build favor with the prison guards as much as with his fellow inmates, but he also thinks Andy did it simply to ""feel normal again.""While watching a movie, Andy approaches Red with another unusual demand and asks for the actress Rita Hayworth. Red is surprised by the demand but agrees to place the order. As he exits the theater, Andy once more encounters the Sisters. Although he is able to talk his way out of being raped, he is brutally beaten within an inch of his life, putting him in the infirmary for a month. Boggs spends a week in solitary for the beating. When he comes out, he finds Hadley and his men waiting in his cell. They beat him so badly that he's left unable to walk or eat solid food for the rest of his life and is transferred to a prison hospital upstate. The Sisters move on and never bother Andy again. When Andy gets out of the infirmary, he finds a bunch of rocks for him to sculpt and a giant poster of Rita Hayworth in his cell; presents from Red and his friends.Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) hears about how Andy helped Hadley and uses a surprise cell inspection to size Andy up. He finds Andy reading his copy of the Holy Bible and they talk about their favorite verses while the guards are turning the cell upside down looking for illegal possessions. Satisfied with their encounter, the warden leaves and almost forget to give Andy his Bible back. He then encourages Andy to keep reading the Bible saying that ''Salvation lays within''.Andy is later advised that he will now work in the prison library with aging inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). The reason for his transfer is made obvious when a prison guard shows up asking Andy for financial advising. Andy sets-up a makeshift desk and starts working, providing financial advising to most prison guards and helping them with their income tax returns. Andy also sees an opportunity to expand the prison library; he starts by asking the Maine state senate for funds. He writes letters every week. His financial support practice is so appreciated that even guards from other prisons, when they visit for inter-prison baseball matches, seek Andy's financial expertise. Even the warden himself has Andy preparing his tax returns.Not long afterwards, Brooks snaps and threatens to kill Heywood in order to avoid being paroled. Andy is able to talk him down. When his friends discuss Brooks 'behavior, Red sympathizes with Brooks having obviously become ""institutionalized,"" after spending 50 years at Shawshank. He has become essentially conditioned to be a prisoner for the rest of his life and is unable to adapt to the outside world. Red remarks: ""These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them."" Brooks is paroled and goes to live in a halfway house. He is also given a job at a supermarket which he hates. Finding it impossible to adjust to life outside the prison, he eventually commits suicide, leaving the message ""Brooks was here"" carved on a wooden beam .After six years of writing letters, Andy receives $200 from the state for the library, along with a collection of old books and phonograph records. Though the state Senate thinks this will be enough to get Andy to halt his letter-writing campaign, he is undaunted and redoubles his efforts.When the donations of old books and records arrive at the warden's office, Andy finds a copy of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro among the records. He locks the guard assigned to the warden's office in the bathroom and plays the record over the prison's PA system. The entire prison is soon captivated by the music. Red remarks that the voices of these women made everyone feel free, if only for a brief moment. Outside the office, Norton appears furious at the act of defiance, and orders Andy to turn off the record player. Andy responds by turning up the volume. The warden orders Hadley to break into the office and Andy is sent immediately to solitary confinement for two weeks. When he gets out, he tells his friends that the stretch was the ""easiest time"" he ever did in the hole because he spent it with Mozart's Figaro stuck in his head for comfort. When the other prisoners tell him how unlikely that is, he talks about the power that hope can have in prison and that hope can sustain them. Red strongly disagrees with Andy, claiming that hope is a dangerous thing in a place like Shawshank and tells Andy he should get used to living without it. Andy implies that this is exactly what Brooks did and Red leaves the table angry.Not long after, Red has a new parole hearing and realizes he's been in prison for 30 years now. He uses the exact same words he used ten years earlier only with no enthusiasm at all. His parole is rejected again. Andy gives him an harmonica to commemorate his 30 years which Red replies by offering Andy a giant poster of Marilyn Monroe to commemorate his 10 years.About four years after the Mozart incident, the state senate finally comes to the conclusion that they won't get rid of Andy with just another check. So they allow him a budget of $500 a year to build his library. Andy uses it wisely and makes deals with book clubs and charities to create the best prison library in the state and names it after Brooks. With the enlarged library and more materials, Andy begins to mentor inmates who want to receive their high school diplomas so they can get a decent job once they're out.Meanwhile, Warden Norton profits from Andy's knowledge and devises a scheme whereby he puts prison inmates to work on public projects which he wins by outbidding other contractors (prisoners are cheap labor). Occasionally, he allows other contractors to score projects as long as the bribe is good enough. Andy launders the money by setting up several accounts in several banks, along with several investments, using the fake identity of Randall Stephens, a man who only exist on papers, created by Andy himself through his knowledge of the system and mail ordered forms. Randall Stephens officially has a birth certificate, social security number and driving license. Should anyone ever investigate about the scheme; they will chase a man who only exists on paper. Andy shares the details with Red, noting that he had to ""go to prison to learn how to be a crook.""In 1965, a young prisoner named Tommy (Gil Bellows) comes to Shawshank to serve time for breaking and entering. Tommy is easy going, charismatic, and popular among the other inmates and is befriended by both Andy and Red. When Tommy explains that he's been going in and out of prison ever since he was 13 years old, Andy suggests that Tommy should consider another line of work besides theft because he seems to be not so good at it. The suggestion really gets to Tommy and he asks Andy to help him work on earning his high school equivalency diploma. Though Tommy is a good student, he is still frustrated when he takes the exam itself, crumpling it up and tossing it in the trash. Andy retrieves it and sends it in anyway. Tommy asks Red about Andy's case which Red explains. Upon hearing the story, Tommy is visibly upset. He then tells Andy and Red the story of a former cellmate of his from another prison who boasted about killing a man who was a pro golfer at the country club he worked at, along with his lover. The woman's husband, a banker, had gone to prison for those murders.With this new information, Andy, full of hope, meets with the warden, expecting Norton to help him get a new trial with Tommy as a witness. The reaction from Norton is completely contrary to what Andy hoped for. When Andy says emphatically that he would never reveal the money laundering schemes he set up for Norton over the years, the warden becomes furious and orders him to solitary for a month. The inmates discuss the sentence mentioning it is the longest time in solitary that they've ever heard of. They also realize that Andy may truly be innocent after all and has spent almost 20 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit.Tommy receives a letter from the board of education announcing that he has passed the exam and now owns a high school diploma. A guard pass the news to Andy in his solitary cell which makes him smile a little.Later on, Tommy is escorted outside at night to have a private meeting with the warden. Warden Norton asks him if the story he told Andy is true and if he would be willing to testify on Andy's behalf. Tommy enthusiastically agrees. The warden smiles at him before nodding to Hadley to shoot him dead.When the warden visits Andy in solitary, he tells him that Tommy tried to escape and that Hadley had no choice but to shoot him. Andy doesn't buy that story and tells Norton that ''everything'' stops and that he's not going to work for him anymore. The warden threatens Andy to shut down the library, burn all the books, and move Andy to a much different cell in a much different part of the prison with the most hardened criminals should he stop working for him. He then leaves and orders Andy to another month in solitary to think about things.When Andy finally comes out of solitary, he and Red have a conversation where Andy talks about his wife and how much he loved her and feels responsible for her death even though he didn't pulled the trigger. He then talks about his projects should he ever get out of prison. He talks about Zihuatanejo, a beach town on the Pacific coast of Mexico where he'd like to live for the rest of his life and manage a hotel there. He then asks Red if he'd join him to which Red says no and that he believes he is too far gone like Brooks. He then criticizes Andy for allowing hope to mess with his mind like that and that it will only destroy him. Andy agrees and is about to leave when he asks Red if he knows the Buxton, Maine area. He then tells Red about a very specific hay field where there is a large oak tree at the end of a stone wall. He then asks Red to promise him that, should he ever get paroled, he will seek that oak tree and retrieve something that was hidden among the stones but refuses to say what it is. Red promises but is worried about his friend's state of mind. His worries are heightened further when he learns that Andy has asked Haywood for a six-foot rope. Red believes Andy may have finally reached his breaking point and is about to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Norton asks Andy to shine his shoes for him and put his suit in for dry-cleaning before retiring for the night. Andy returns to his cell and the guards turn the lights off for the night. Red remarks that it was the longest night of his life.The following morning, Andy has not answered the morning call and is not standing in front of his cell like every morning. The guard yells at Andy for putting him late and walks to his cell expecting to find a seriously sick or dead Andy. At the same time, Norton becomes alarmed when he finds Andy's shoes in his shoe box instead of his own. The alarm then goes off announcing a missing inmate. Norton rushes to Andy's empty cell and demands an explanation. Hadley brings in Red, but Red insists he knows nothing of Andy's plans. Becoming increasingly hostile and paranoid, Norton starts throwing Andy's sculpted rocks around the cell. When he throws one at Andy's poster of Raquel Welch (in the spot previously occupied by Marilyn Monroe, and before that by Rita Hayworth), the rock punches through and into the wall. Norton tears the poster from the wall revealing a tunnel just wide enough for a man to crawl into.It is revealed in a series of flashback sequences narrated by Red that many years ago, not long after receiving his rock hammer, Andy innocently tried to carve his name on his cell wall when a chunk of it came off. Andy, being a fan of geology, realized that the material the wall was made off of could make it possible for him to dig a hole in case he ever needed to escape. Andy first ordered the giant poster of Rita Hayworth to hide the hole. He then spent years digging at night with his rock hammer and hiding the dirt from his job into his pockets which he would then empty in the courtyard during his morning walks. When Tommy was killed, Andy decided it was time to go.During the previous night's thunderstorm, Andy wore Norton's clothes underneath his own to his cell, catching a lucky break when no one notices Norton's shiny black shoes on his feet, including Red. He packed many of his belongings, some papers and Norton's clothes into a plastic bag which he tied to himself with the rope he'd asked for, and escaped through his hole. The tunnel he'd excavated led him to a space between two walls of the prison where he found a sewer main line. Using a rock, he hit the sewer line in time several times with the lightning strikes and eventually broke it open. After crawling through 500 yards of the raw sewage contained in the pipe, Andy emerged in a brook outside the walls. A search team later found his prison clothes, a bar of soap and a very worn out rock hammer.While the warden and Red are discovering Andy's genius escape, Andy walks into the Maine National Bank in Portland, where he had put Norton's money. Using his assumed identity as Randall Stephens, and with all the necessary documentation, he closes the account and walks out with a cashier's check. Before he leaves, he asks them to drop a package in the mail. He continues his visitations to nearly a dozen other local banks, ending up with some $370,000. The package contains Warden Norton's accounting books, which are delivered straight to the Portland Daily Bugle newspaper along with Andy's written confessions and testimony.Not long after, the Maine state police storm Shawshank Prison along with several reporters to cover the developing story. Hadley is arrested for the murder of Tommy and is taken away by the state police. According to Red, he heard unfounded rumors through the grapevine that Hadley allegedly started ""crying like a little girl"" in the back seat of the police squad car while he was being taken away. Seeing Hadley being taken away in a police squad car and the local district attorney entering the prison with several policemen holding a warrant for Norton's arrest, Warden Norton finally opens his safe in his office, which he hadn't touched since Andy escaped, and instead of his books, he finds the Bible he had given Andy with a note to the warden saying that he was right, ""salvation did lay within"". Norton then opens it to the book of Exodus and finds that the pages had all been cut out in the shape of Andy's rock hammer. Norton walks back to his desk as the police pound on his door, takes out a small revolver and commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. Red remarks that he wondered if the warden thought, right before pulling the trigger, how ""Andy could ever have gotten the best of him.""Shortly after, Red receives a postcard from Fort Hancock, Texas, with nothing written on it. Red takes it as a sign that Andy made it into Mexico to freedom. Red and his buddies kill time talking about Andy's exploits (with a few embellishments), but Red falls into a sort of depression from missing his friend.At Red's next parole hearing in 1967, he talks to the parole board about how ""rehabilitated"" is just a made-up word invented to justify their job. He then explains how much he regrets his actions of the past, not because he's in jail but because he knows how wrong it was. He then closes by saying that he has to live with that for the rest of his life and ask the board to stop wasting his time and leave him alone. His parole is finally granted. He goes to live and work at the same places that Brooks did, even seeing Brooks 'message carved into the wooden beam. He frequently walks by a pawn shop which has several guns in the window. At times he contemplates trying to get back into prison feeling that he has no life outside of prison where he has spent most of his adult life, but he remembers the promise he made to Andy. He then reveals that he was not looking at the guns but at the compasses behind the guns and he bought one.Red follows Andy's instructions, hitchhiking to Buxton and finding the stone wall Andy described. Just as Andy said, there is a large black stone. Underneath is a small box containing a large sum of cash and instructions to come find him in Zihuatanejo although he doesn't name the city just in case. He also says he needs somebody ""who can get things"" for a ""project"" of his. Red suddenly understands all the power of hope and feels exhilarated by the feelings inside of him.After carving a new message in the wooden beam which reads: ""Brooks was here, so was Red"", Red violates parole and leaves the halfway house, unconcerned since no one is likely to do an extensive manhunt for ""an old crook like [him]."" Red takes a bus to Fort Hancock, where he crosses into Mexico. The two friends are finally reunited on a beach of the Pacific coast, just like Andy had been hoping for."

I.Q.,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110099/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mechanic romances the mathematician niece of physicist Albert Einstein, with help from him and his friends. Ed Walters, an auto mechanic, falls for the intelligent and beautiful Catherine Boyd. It is love at first sight. There is however a problem: she's engaged to stuffy professor James Moreland. Fortunately, her uncle likes Ed, and he and his friends scheme to make her fall for Ed. The comedy in this movie stems from the fact that her uncle is none other than Albert Einstein, who's portrayed as a fun loving humble genius, as are his mischievous friends, Nathan, Kurt, and Boris.—Rob Hartill During the film opening, we see a man, presumably Einstein (Walter Mathau) playing a violin, as another man walks past a poster advertising Boyd's comet. We then see Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) with her fiance James Moreland (Stephen Fry). She's working on some math referring to the comet. He comments that she's babbling when she tries to tell him a story. The scene cuts back and forth with a group of elderly men arguing about whether time exists. Meg and James are in his convertible when it develops engine trouble. We see Einstein discussing with his friends (the elderly men), whether there are 'accidents' and he says, ""I do not believe God plays dice with the universe.""Catherine and James pull into a garage, where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is arguing with his boss, Bob (Tony Shalhoub), about the car they hear coming into the shop, what make and model it is and what the trouble with it is, based on what they can hear. Bob sends out Ed to check because he sees the couple and assumes they're ""college people"" meaning they come from Princeton College. As soon as Ed sees Catherine, he falls for her.James, obnoxiously asks if someone there can work on a British engine, and Ed says, ""May I look under the bonnet?"" James, reassured by the use of the word 'bonnet' consents. Ed looks at it, looks at Catherie and pronounces, ""You have no spark."" There's clearly a double meaning here, referring to her relationship with James. James insists, ""But what's wrong with it?"" and Ed adds, ""My guess is that you have a short stroke and premature ignition."" He turns to Meg Ryan and says, ""Does it ever feel that way?"" She replies, ""I'm sure I don't know what you mean"" but it's clear that she gets the double entendre. Ed says he'll go check with his boss about fixing it, and goes in to tell his boss that he's in love, that time and space stopped, that he could see himself kissing Catherine in the future. Ed tells Catherine that fixing the car will take days, and she uses his phone to call a cab, giving the cab company and Ed her address for the invoice. In the process, she leaves behind a pocket watch. There's a brief moment where you see a hand move the watch under some magazines, but whose hand? And is it an accident? Or deliberate? The theme of accident versus deliberate intervention occurs repeatedly in the film.Ed goes to return the pocket watch and discovers that the address is the home of Albert Einstein, who is Catherine's uncle. Ed helps Einstein and his friends retrieve a badminton racket and in the process befriends them. It's clear to them that Ed likes Catherine. Einstein sees that his niece is unhappy with her fiance and wonders how to help Ed date her. She will only date a very intelligent man, and Ed is an auto mechanic. Ed says, ""That's easy, lend me your brain for a couple of days."" Einstein gets an idea.Einstein and his three friends hatch a plot to make Catherine think that Ed has developed cold fusion as a way to power a rocket to reach the stars so she'll desire him. They help Ed appear hyper-intelligent, helping him present a paper on cold fusion at a symposium and then helping him pass an IQ test administered by Catherine's fiance. Catherine, as a mathematician, is trying to figure out ""Ed's"" theory on cold fusion, but she struggles with it. Ed wants to tell Catherine he's a fake, but he can't quite seem to. Einstein and his buddies interfere with Catherine's relationship with James, and encourage Ed. James is presented as a sadistic, sexually cold man who puts Catherine down subtly.Of course, there's always a happily-ever-after ending, even though it takes President Eisenhower's appearance in the film, a convertible, a motorcycle, waltz music, engineered automotive troubles and a comet, to make it all come about."

Quiz Show,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110932/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young lawyer, Richard Goodwin, investigates a potentially fixed game show. Charles Van Doren, a big time show winner, is under Goodwin's investigation. An idealistic young lawyer working for a Congressional subcommittee in the late 1950s discovers that TV quiz shows are being fixed. His investigation focuses on two contestants on the show ""Twenty-One"": Herbert Stempel, a brash working-class Jew from Queens, and Charles Van Doren, the patrician scion of one of America's leading literary families. Based on a true story.—Tim Horrigan <horrigan@hanover-crrel.army.mil> In 1958 when television quiz shows ruled the airwaves, Charles Van Doren was the wildly popular champion of a successful TV show called ""Twenty-One."" A national celebrity who appeared on the covers of both ""Time"" and ""Life"" magazines, Van Doren was an American folk hero. Week after week audiences tuned in to watch as Van Doren, a popular English instructor at Columbia University and the product of one of America's most renowned literary families, seemed to draw from his vast knowledge the correct answers to obscure questions. His charming presence seduced 50 million people into believing him. But the truth is, viewers were fooled and saw only what the network and program's producers wanted them to see. Then someone pulled the plug. When disgruntled contestant Herbie Stempel charged that the quiz game was a fraud, Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin uncovered the facts that exposed the deception, and sent shock waves reverberating across America.—alfiehitchie In 1958, the questions and answers to be used for the latest broadcast of NBC's popular quiz show Twenty-One are transported from a secure bank vault to the studio. The evening's main attraction is Queens resident Herb Stempel (John Turturro), the reigning champion, who correctly answers question after question. However, both the network and the program's corporate sponsor, the supplementary tonic Geritol, find that Stempel's approval ratings are beginning to level out, meaning that the show would benefit from new talent.Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) are surprised when Columbia University instructor Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), son of a prominent literary family, visits their office to audition. Realizing that they have found an ideal challenger for Stempel, they offer to ask the same questions during the show which Van Doren correctly answered during his audition. He refuses, but when he comes within reach of a game-winning 21 points on the show, he is asked one of the questions from his audition. After a moment of moral indecision, he gives the correct answer. Stempel deliberately misses an easy question and loses, having been promised a future in television if he does so.In the weeks that follow, Van Doren's winning streak makes him a national celebrity, but he buckles under the pressure and allows Enright and Freedman to start giving him the answers. Meanwhile, Stempel, having lost his prize money to an unscrupulous bookie, begins threatening legal action against NBC after weeks go by without his return to television. He visits New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan, who convenes a grand jury to look into his allegations.Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow), a young Congressional lawyer, learns that the grand jury findings have been sealed and travels to New York City to investigate rumors of rigged quiz shows. Visiting a number of contestants, including Stempel and Van Doren, he begins to suspect that Twenty-One is a fixed operation. However, Stempel's volatile personality damages his credibility, and nobody else seems willing to confirm that the show is fixed. Fearing Goodwin will give up the investigation, Stempel confesses that he was fed the correct answers during his run on the show, and insists that Van Doren must have been involved as well. Another former contestant gives Goodwin a set of answers that he mailed to himself two days before his quiz show appearance, which Goodwin takes to be corroborating evidence.Van Doren deliberately loses, but NBC offers him a lucrative contract to appear as a special correspondent on the morning Today show. The House Committee for Legislative Oversight convenes a hearing, at which Goodwin presents his evidence of the quiz show's corruption. Stempel testifies at the hearing but fails to convince the committee, and both NBC network head Robert Kintner (Allan Rich) and Geritol executive Martin Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese) deny any knowledge of Twenty-One being rigged. Subpoenaed by Goodwin, Van Doren testifies before the committee and admits his role in the deception. After the hearing adjourns, he learns from reporters that he has been fired from Today and that Columbia's board of trustees is going to ask for his resignation.Goodwin believes that he is on the verge of a victory against Geritol and NBC, but realizes that Enright and Freedman will not jeopardize their own futures in television by turning against their bosses. He silently watches the producers' testimony, vindicating the sponsors and the network from any wrongdoing, and taking full responsibility for rigging the show."

A week before he's supposed to leave, he encounters a young man who attempts suicide--a pretty straightforward case, except that the young man claims to be Don Juan, the fabled Spanish nobleman and world-renowned seducer/lover of women. Despite original hostility from his co-workers, Jack manages to persuade his associates to put the youth in his care for 10 days after which the youth will undergo an evaluation to be either released from psychiatric care or sent to a mental institution.

Color of Night,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109456/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A color-blind psychoanalyst is stalked by an unknown killer after taking over his murdered friend's therapy group, all of whom have a connection to a mysterious young woman that he begins having intense sexual encounters with. Psychologist gives up his practice when he unintentionally pushes a patient to commit suicide. In an effort to come to terms with this tragedy he visits an old colleague who is subsequently murdered. The quest to catch the killer centers around a group of psychologically disturbed patients, however equally as important is an affair which develops between himself and the mysterious Rose.—Anonymous Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) is psychoanalyst to the rich and unhinged in New York City. One day, Michelle (Kathleen Wilhoite), one of his most disturbed patients, arrives to her therapy session in a particularly fragile state of mind. Bill seems to make light of her problems, and when he flippantly tells her to ""look in the mirror,"" and starts making a phone call in the middle of their session, she reacts by jumping out of the window of his office and falling to her death.The sight of Michelle's blood pooling, dark red around her bright green dress, causes Capa to suffer from stress-induced color blindness. He loses the ability to see the color red. The title of the film refers to the fact that, instead of red, he sees only shades of gray. His friend and mentor, Dr. Larry Ashland (Jeff Corey), urges Bill to forgive himself for his patient's death. Bill tells Larry that he's going to take some time off to visit an old college buddy in California and see if that helps give him a fresh start.Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Bill's friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore (Scott Bakula) invites him to join his Monday evening group therapy session. A bit reluctantly, Bill accepts, and meets the members of the group.Clark (Brad Dourif) suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things. Sondra (Lesley Ann Warren) is a nymphomaniac and a kleptomaniac with a habit of marrying wealthy older men who die. Buck (Lance Henriksen) is a salty ex-cop who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder after surviving the brutal murder of his wife and daughter. Casey (Kevin J. O'Connor) is a sado-masochist whose wealthy, abusive father subsidizes his artistic lifestyle on condition that he remain in therapy. Richie Dexter is a sixteen-year-old boy with a stutter and a gender identity problem, who has had run-ins with the law for drugs. The patients tease each other playfully, exhibiting an easy rapport, and yet the tension generated by some of their interactions hints at a dark side in each of them.After the session, Bob drives Bill to his luxurious Malibu home in his Mercedes convertible. The house is heavily protected by all sorts of electronic devices, because Bob has had some anonymous death threats, which he believes come from someone in the Monday group Bill just met. Bob quizzes Bill about his impressions of his patients-- he had hoped Bill could use his ""tuning fork,"" a special intuitive sense he has for diagnosing mental illness, to determine which of them might be capable of murder. Bill wonders what Buck might be hiding and singles out Richie as a ""genuine nut-case,"" but didn't detect a murderous vibe emanating from anyone.A couple of days later, Moore is stabbed to death in his office by a masked figure in black. Police Detective Lieutenant Hector Martinez (Rubén Blades) suspects one of the patients of the Monday group to be the killer and he asks Capa to inform the group of Moore's death. Capa doesn't want to get involved but agrees to break the news because he can do it with more sensitivity and tact than Martinez would use.The next day, as Bill is driving Moore's car, he gets rear-ended by a pretty young girl in a jeep. She introduces herself as Rose (Jane March). As Rose has no driver's insurance, Bill gives her his phone number and address so they can settle the matter later.Next Monday evening, Bill tells the group about Bob's death. They're shocked and devastated, and ask Bill if he'd be willing to take over the Monday evening sessions because they feel comfortable with him, especially after he shares his own recent, tragic experience.Martinez debriefs Capa about the last Monday night session. Since no one confessed to Bob's murder, Martinez orders Capa to shut the group down. Capa refuses, as he's just made both a personal and professional commitment to lead the group. Martinez rages at Capa but can't persuade him to abandon the group. He then reveals that he wired Bob's office and listened in on the last session. Capa returns to Bob's place to find that someone has broken in and left a hose running inside of the house, flooding the grounds.A couple of days later, Rose comes to Moore's house and, feeling a budding attraction, Capa takes her to a restaurant. After dinner, on the sidewalk near the restaurant, they kiss, but Rose leaves abruptly in a taxi, without even giving her phone number to Capa.Dale Dexter (Andrew Lowery), Richie's older brother and legal guardian, asks Bill for permission to take Richie out of therapy. Bill reminds Dale that, psychological issues aside, Richie was sentenced by the court to mandatory treatment-- Bill says that he will need to study Richie's file and deal with legal red tape before he can make that kind of decision.One morning while he is out jogging, Bill finds a live rattlesnake in his mailbox. Fortunately for him, he gets rid of it without being bitten. Martinez comes by and demands more answers, insinuating that Bill is now a suspect. Rose shows up shortly afterwards and since it's their second date, they immediately have sex, first in the swimming-pool, and then in Moore's fancy bedroom (and a few more places in the director's cut).Bill inquires within the social welfare system about Richie, and discovers that, when Richie was twelve, he was treated by a psychiatrist named Dr. Niedelmeyer.Meanwhile, we see Sondra return home after a shopping spree with her girlfriend Bonnie. Bonnie, who speaks with an english accent and flirts aggressively with Sondra, turns out to be Rose, Capa's lover, in a red wig and heavy make-up. Bonnie / Rose pitches a fit when Sondra tells her that Capa's on his way, then kisses Sondra on the mouth and rushes past Capa to make a quick exit. Sondra reveals to Capa that Richie was molested as a child but becomes incensed when he asks her if Richie might be violent. She screams that Clark is the one Capa should investigate. After Capa leaves, Sondra has sex with her personal trainer, a beautiful young male.Bill goes to Dale's workshop. Dale is a successful sculptor and furniture designer. The workshop itself is an old, disused iron factory that boasts a tower several storeys high. Bill tells Dale that he thinks it is a bit premature to take Richie out of therapy, which clearly doesn't sit well with Dale.Bill pays a visit to Edith Niedelmeyer (Shirley Knight), Dr. Niedelmeyer's widow, but, when he mentions Richie, she slams her door in his face.Another Monday rolls around. Bill asks the group about their current intimate relationships. Sondra tells the group about Bonnie, whom she wishes ""was a guy,"" Casey mentions his beautiful new model, Buck describes the sweet and innocent young woman he has met. Richie says that he only has his brother. Clark, baited by Sondra, has a meltdown in group during which he admits that he, too, has a new ""somebody"" in his life.Bill checks on Clark who tells him more about this perfect new girlfriend of his. Bill guesses that Clark has been seeing Sondra, and Clark goes on to say that Sondra was so jealous of his girlfriend that she attacked Clark with a butcher knife and then came back the next day and hacked his girlfriend's dress to ribbons. Clark states that Sondra is dangerous. After leaving Clark, Bill is driving around Los Angeles when a mysterious red Camaro with tinted windows gives chase. After his car gets hit several times by the red car, he finally manages to lose it at a railroad crossing.Bill visits Martinez at his birthday party. Martinez informs Bill that Sondra stabbed her father with a knife and fork, Casey set his father's house on fire, Clark beat his wife so badly she wound up in intensive care and Richie has a history of drug abuse. Martinez claims that he couldn't find anything on Buck, so Bill swings by Buck's place after the party and discovers that his wife and small daughter died in a car-jacking, which Buck believes might've been ""payback for something.""When Bill gets back to Bob's house, he's frightened to see that someone's broken in again. He creeps around cautiously until he encounters Rose in the kitchen. She explains that she stole one of the house keys last time she was there. Bill yells at Rose that she doesn't seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation, but feels bad when she breaks down in tears. They eat and then have sex again.The next morning, Bill learns from Detective Anderson (Eriq La Salle), one of Martinez's deputies, that Buck discovered that his wife was cheating on him with Martinez two days before she died; that as veteran narcotics agents, both men had a lot of enemies on the street, and that anyone could have ordered a hit on Buck's wife, including Martinez or Buck himself.Bill has an appointment to meet Casey at his loft, but just before Bill arrives, Casey is strangled and bled to death. Bill breaks into Casey's loft when no one answers the bell. He finds the corpse and also some paintings burning in the fireplace. A face on one of the half-burnt paintings looks a bit like Bonnie. Bill belatedly notices that the puddle of grey paint soaking his jeans is actually Casey's blood.Meanwhile, Rose (in her Bonnie persona) is out for the evening with Sondra. At Sondra's house, they dance to some music and then spy Sondra's neighbors having sex. This excites the two women and they undress and make out with each other. But Rose / Bonnie stops before it goes any further, sobbing to Sondra that she's ""jinxed."" Sondra comforts Rose / Bonnie and tells her that she finds her beautiful without the red wig, which she removes.On another Monday afternoon, Rose appears at Bob's place. She and Bill start looking at Bob's photo albums. Rose abruptly decides that she doesn't want to see any more photos and lures Bill outside to sunbathe in the garden. Later, thinking Bill's in the shower, Rose hurries to remove some pictures from the photo album, but Bill sees her. She runs out of the house and drives away in her car. Bill drives after her, but loses her.Later that evening, it's time for the Monday group session. Clark, performing his usual counting ritual, notices that one book, which was missing a week before, is now back in place. Bill guesses that kleptomaniac Sondra stole it, and asks her to show him the book. Actually it is Moore's diary hidden inside an art book cover. In the diary, Bill finds a photo Bob snapped of Rose naked. Everyone in the group recognizes the woman in the photo as being his or her own girlfriend. Richie looks at the picture and leaves the room. Martinez arrives and berates everyone in the group for being idiots.Bill gives Detective Anderson the license number of Rose's car and asks him to find the owner of the car. Detective Anderson gives the name of the owner of Rose's car to his boss, Lieutenant Martinez. As Bill walks near a parking structure, the red car with the tinted windows pushes another car from the top of the structure, and the falling car misses Bill by a few inches.Bill consults once more with his friend Larry, who questions the wisdom of pursuing a serious relationship with a woman who at best suffers from a multiple personality disorder and could also quite possibly have killed his good friend (and her former lover) Bob Moore, as well as Casey. Bill maintains that he wants to continue to see young Rose.Bill knocks on Mrs. Niedelmeyer's door again and this time when she slams it in his face, he busts it down, demanding answers. Mrs. Niedelmeyer reluctantly tells Bill that Richie Dexter killed himself four years ago, because her husband, Richie's psychiatrist, molested him.Bill rushes to Dale's workshop, where he finds Richie sitting in a chair, bloodied and agitated. He takes off Richie's wig and glasses, and (as everyone expected) is it Rose. She explains that after Richie's suicide, her brother Dale forced her to dress and act like Richie, and if she resisted, he would beat and molest her. After ""Richie"" developed a bad drug problem that got him busted, s/he had to go to the therapy group. She started to feel she wanted to be a girl again, but she didn't dare, at first, to be Rose, so she was Bonnie. She started to be Rose again when she fell in love with Bill.When Bill tries to get Rose to leave with him, he discovers that her hands have been nailed to the arm-rests of the chair by Dale. He pries the nails up and frees Rose, but Dale comes back and starts shooting at them with his nail-gun. He nails Bill's arm to the wall and is about to kill him when Lt. Martinez appears and points his gun at him. Dale is faster than Martinez and while Martinez is bragging about his detective skills, he nails both of Martinez's hands to the wall. Bill and Rose run away, but Dale, using a forklift, dumps a cabinet on Bill, who pushes Rose out of the way. Rose escapes, but Dale catches Bill and ties him inside a metal cage.Bill touches a nerve in Dale when he uses his ""tuning fork"" to figure out that Dale's obsession with turning Rose into Richie must stem from his guilt over having allowed Niedelmeyer to treat Richie, knowing that Niedelmeyer was a sexual predator due to the fact that Niedelmeyer had previously molested Dale himself.Dale explains to the captive Bill that he killed Moore because Moore was beginning to understand who Richie really was. And he killed Casey because Casey, with his painter's eyes, would eventually perceive that ""Bonnie"" and ""Richie"" were the same person. Dale announces his plan to cut Bill into little pieces, but Rose aims the nail-gun at him and kills him with a nail to the head.Stricken with grief after killing her brother, Rose aims the nail gun at her own head and pulls the trigger-- fortunately, it's out of nails. She runs up the tower in the pouring rain, Bill clambering up after her. When she reaches the platform at the top, she wants to throw herself from it, but Bill catches her and puts her back on the platform, where they start kissing passionately. There is a red beacon flashing in the background and suddenly, Bill can see the real red color of the beacon: he has been cured of his color-blindness by love!In the final shot, Bill and Rose continue to kiss on the platform in the pouring rain while Martinez's voice manages to reach them loud and clear despite the fact that they're five storeys up in a torrential rainstorm-- he pleads for them to come back downstairs and ""Get me out of heeeeeeerrrrre!!!"""

Léon: The Professional,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"12-year-old Mathilda is reluctantly taken in by Léon, a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. An unusual relationship forms as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin's trade. After her father, step-mother, step-sister and little brother are killed by her father's employers, the 12-year-old daughter of an abject drug dealer manages to take refuge in the apartment of a professional hitman who at her request teaches her the methods of his job so she can take her revenge on the corrupt DEA agent who ruined her life by killing her beloved brother.—J. S. Golden Leon (played by Jean Reno) lives in New York and is a professional hit man. One of his neighbors, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), is a 12-year old girl with family problems, one of which is that her father is a petty criminal. One day, a drug kingpin, Stansfield (Gary Oldman), kills her entire family due to something her father did. Mathilda turns to Leon for help...and revenge.—grantss Reclusive, taciturn, and lethally efficient, the plant-loving New Yorker and professional hitman, or ""cleaner"", Léon, sees his world turn upside down, when the entire family of his tough twelve-year-old neighbour, Mathilda, is wiped out by a corrupt DEA agent. Having no one else to turn to, the streetwise teenager worms her way into Léon's otherwise quiet life, going as far as to make a preposterous deal with her new surrogate father: in exchange for Léon's extensive knowledge in the cruel art of killing, Mathilda will do the housework. Now, a fervent desire to avenge her little brother is the only thing that keeps Mathilda going. However, has she what it takes to taste the ambrosial juice of retribution?—Nick Riganas Léon (Reno) lives a lonely life in New York, working as a professional hitman for the mob. Near-silent and utterly ruthless, Léon doesn't seem to possess an ounce of humanity. But when his 12-year-old neighbour, Mathilda (Portman), arrives home to find her entire family massacred by a drug dealer (Oldman), Léon takes her in and, as per her request, teaches her the tools of his trade so that she can exact her revenge on her family's killer. Léon (Jean Reno) is a hitman (or ""cleaner"" as he would rather be known) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. Most of his work comes from a mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello), who operates from the ""Supreme Macaroni Company"" retail store. Léon spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his ""best friend"", and (in one scene) watching old Gene Kelly musicals.Léon is highly motivated and efficient. He kills plenty of bodyguards (Ed Ventresca) so that a fat guy called Fatman (Frank Senger) receives a phonecall threatening him. A dumb blonde (Ouin-Ouin) walks away non-noncommittally and says she will call him later, not wanting to get involved in the matter.On a particular day on his way home, he sees Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. A cadre of DEA agents storm the building, led by a ragged and drug-addicted Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Stansfield shoots Mathilda's entire family with a shotgun; the whore-looking mother (Ellen Greene), the aerobic-obsessed elder sister (Elizabeth Regen) and the friendly little brother (Carl J. Matusovich)- missing Mathilda only because she is out shopping when they arrive. An elderly lady (Jessie Keosian) comes back inquiring what the rackas is about, and Stansfield shoots the glass behind her, but considers her harmless so he lets her be, just barking at her ""go back inside"".When Mathilda returns with the groceries she was sent to buy and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway past the open door of her family's apartment, and receives sanctuary from a reluctant Léon. One of the agents () looks at Mathilda, quizzingly, as she has to insistently ring the bell on and on before Léon lets her in. Stansfield realises that there's a little girl missing because of a family photograph he's found. When the news reaches the door guard, he approaches Léon's apartment, wondering whether the girl who was accepted there was the missing girl. Léon prepares himself to shoot him, watching through a hidden peephole, but at that moment, Mathilda turns on the TV with some  Transformers  cartoons, which convinces the guard that he saw another girl who had nothing to do with the situation.León offers some consolation to Mathilda, making her smile when he argues than pigs smell well and are better than many people, and make-pretends that the puppet pig he's using is talking to her. Mathilda, who soon discovers that Léon is a hitman, begs him to become her caretaker, and to teach her his skills as a ""cleaner"": she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family that she actually loved. In return, she offers herself as a maid and teacher, remedying Léon's illiteracy. Mathilda says that he could have let her to die outside that door, but as he opened it, now he's responsible for her well-being. At first, Léon refuses point blank: being a ""cleaner"" is not a job for girls, and then he alleges that she's not made for that. To answer to that, Mathilda shoots some pigeons with one of the guns Léon is cleaning. Léon hesitantly accepts her offer and the two begin working together, slowly building an emotional attachment, with Léon becoming a friend and father figure.They leave Léon's apartment, and Léon begins to settle some rules. Mathilda carries León's plant, accepting everything, and convinces the hotel clerk (George Martin) that she's preparing for an audition, and that she won't practice after 10. When the hotel clerk asks Léon to fill up the registration form, Mathilda jumps right in and says ""You know how much I love registering. Can I do it, daddy?"" Léon breaths, and apprecciates that Mathilda is resourceful. The hotel clerk congratulates Léon because he's got a good daughter, but he's got a 17-year-old who can't do anything. León leaves his plant at reception. He checks everything in the room, the exits, the windows, while Mathilda fills up the form. As they work together, Mathilda admits to Léon several times that she is falling in love with him, in spite of him making her drink a glass of milk every day.Tony has been keeping Léon's money, instead of it being put into a bank. As Léon was illiterate, he didn't want to have to deal with it. Léon asks if he could give it to somebody; Tony tells him that he's like a bank, only that there's no paperwork involved, but that he's got all the accountancy in his mind, and that is security enough. Tony wants Léon to renew work, as training won't earn him any money. Léon prevents Mathilda from flirting with a guy (Michael Mundra), a cute teenage boy a little older than herself - she replies that they were only sharing a cigarette - to which Léon answers that he wants her to quit smoking. Léon adds that she should stay away from him, as he looks like a weirdo. Léon walks to work. Mathilda tells the hotel clerk that she's fed up of practicing her instrument and that Léon is not her father, but her lover. Mathilda walks back to her old flat. She slips past a police guard and picks up a teddy bear and a stack of bills hidden under a loose floor plank. She has to hide, because the FBI is questioning Stansfield, who is being a jackass about the people he killed in the line of duty. He shouts to the FBI guy that kids should be at school, and also shouts his office number.Mathilda follows Stansfield by taxi to the police station. Mathilda is watching cartoon  Transformers  again when Léon arrives with blood dripping down an arm and a pink dress for her. The hotel clerk arrives with two men, and throws Leon and Mathilda out. In another hotel, Léon takes a shower and stitches a wound in the chest, where he's been hurt. Mathilda wants to pay Léon to kill her brother's killers, but Léon doesn't want to. He tells her that life changes after the first time you kill somebody. She wants to play Russian roulette with him. She threatens him with killing herself - and at the last second he pushes the pistol away. Mathilda and Léon go talk with Tony.As Mathilda increases her confidence and experience, she locates Stansfield, follows him to his office in the DEA building. She attempts to kill him, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. Léon finds a note she left him declaring her intentions and rushes to the federal building. He rescues her, killing two of Stansfield's men in the process.Stansfield is enraged that the ""Italian hitman"" has gone rogue and is killing his men. He confronts Tony and threatens him, eventually beating him into surrendering Léon's whereabouts. Later, as Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team, sent by Stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate Léon's apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and takes one of their members hostage, rapidly bartering him for Mathilda's freedom. As they slink back into the apartment, Léon creates a quick escape for Matilda as he reassures her and tells her that he loves her moments before they come for him.In the chaos that follows, Léon sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded ESU officer, almost unnoticed except for Stansfield. Stansfield follows Léon into the hotel lobby and shoots him from behind. Looming over the dying Léon, Stansfield jeers him haughtily. However just before he gives out, Léon places an object in Stansfield's hands, which he explains is ""from Mathilda"". Opening his hands, Stansfield recognizes it as grenade pin. He rips open Léon's vest to discover several grenades on his chest. Stansfield lets out a brief ""Oh, shit"" before a massive explosion destroys the hotel lobby.Mathilda heads to Tony's place as she was instructed to do by Léon. Tony will not give Mathilda more than a few dollars of the fortune Léon had amassed, which was being held by Tony. His reasoning is that she is not old enough to receive the large amount of money and that school should be her priority until she's older. When Mathilda asks Tony to give her a 'job', and insists that she can 'clean' as Léon had, Tony sternly informs her that he 'ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid!' Having nowhere else to go, she is then seen going to Roosevelt Island using the Roosevelt Island Tramway. The next day, she returns to school in NJ. Seemingly readmitted to the school, Mathilda walks into a field in front of it with Léon's houseplant in hand, she digs a hole and plants the houseplant in the grounds of the school, as she had told Léon he should, ""to give it roots."""

With her fame as Nancy Thompson inWes Craven'sA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)andA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987)resurfacing, lead actressHeather Langenkampcatches the attention of a sinister telephone stalker. But ten years after the release of the original nightmare, escalating violence coincides with the mysterious emergence of an all-too-familiar tormentor haunting the dreams of Heather's son, Dylan. As a result, ancient evil invades the physical realm, poisoning reality. As Heather and her long-time movie partnerRobert Englundjoin forces to stop the advent of sheer terror, pure darkness rises with a shocking master plan. If evil never dies, can two mere mortals thwart Freddy Krueger's grand scheme and defeat Hell's razor-clawed champion?—Nick Riganas Just as the first Nightmare film opened with the creation of Freddy's infamous glove, New Nightmare opens with the creation of an updated, more sinister and sleeker looking glove. As the maker of the claws appears to chop off his own hand in preparation for attaching the claws to his own wrist, the other people on the set wince, and the director, Wes Craven, encourages the effects specialists to pump more blood. Soon he yells, ""Cut! Print that Gretchen!"" Heather Langenkamp, her husband, Chase, and their son, Dylan, are wandering around the set of the new Nightmare on Elm Street movie.Presently the claw, which was only a prop a minute ago, comes to life and starts maiming and killing the special effects crew. Dylan is now gone, and as the claw advances to attack Chase, Heather screams waking up in her own bed in her own house with Chase, during an earthquake in Los Angeles. After the earthquake dies down Chase has a couple of scratches, which are the very same as he had received in the dream. This causes Heather to wonder if they were sustained in the earthquake or during the dream. Heather reveals she has been receiving harassing phone calls from ""someone who sounds an awful lot like Freddy"", but they've stopped for the last couple weeks until now.Heather is a guest on a morning talk show the very same day, where they discuss the 10th anniversary of the ""Nightmare"" films. Also, as part of the talk show line-up, Robert Englund as himself tears through a screen dressed up as Freddy Krueger to surprise Heather, Heather is slightly disturbed by this. Producer Bob Shaye asks Heather to visit his office at New Line Cinema, and explains that Wes Craven is working on a script for the new and final ""Nightmare"" film. Heather is asked to reprise her role as main character ""Nancy"", but decides against it with her own recent nightmares, disturbing phone calls, and disgruntlement over her son's change in behavior. Bob explains that her husband Chase Porter is also working on the film and he is creating a scary new glove for Freddy, much to Heather's dismay.When she gets home, her son has an episode during which he warns her in a voice not of his own, ""Never sleep again!"" Worried, Heather asks Chase to come home, however Chase falls asleep at the wheel on the way and dies supposedly in a car crash. When Heather goes to identify the body, it seems to her that there may have been more than meets the eye to the ""crash"", as was made apparent by the claw-like marks on his chest. Dylan, now also grief stricken, continues acting even more strangely.She enlists Wes Craven's help for making sense of what's been happening. Craven explains that he does not know much more than she does. He dreams a scene or two each night and wakes up and writes them down. Craven goes on to tell her that in the script he's been writing, pure evil can be temporarily defeated if its essence is effectively captured in a work of art that is able to allow evil to express itself. Craven explains that the evil has taken the form of Freddy Krueger because it is a familiar one. ""Freddy"" sees her as the gatekeeper who holds Freddy at bay, since Heather's character Nancy defeated Freddy in the first movie who in turn eliminated Nancy in the third, but still couldn't be released. To Freddy it is Heather that gave the character of Nancy her fortitude. Freddy is attacking her at her weakest points, trying to break her down before confronting her, prompting her to leave just as confused as when she arrived.After a short sleep in Dylan's room, Heather wakes to discover Dylan is gone, she goes downstairs and finds Dylan in another episode. Heather finally takes Dylan to the hospital, there a doctor asks if Dylan said anything during his trance, Heather says ""No"" but the doctor later gets it out of her that Dylan has been doing Freddy-like actions and singing Freddy's theme. Later, Julie (Dylan's babysitter) shows up at the hospital and tells Heather she had a nightmare about him. Soon, two nurses want to sedate Dylan, but Julie had been instructed by Heather to not let Dylan fall asleep while she goes home to get Rex. Julie ends up punching a nurse and threatening another with a needle (cameo appearance by Wes Craven's daughter), and locks the door. Meanwhile, Heather tried to leave but had been stopped by security guards to be questioned by the doctor, the doctor suspects Heather is insane, and tries to get her to agree to foster care. Next, Dylan drifts to sleep, Freddy appears in the locked hospital room and brutally slays Julie.(ironically in the same fashion as Tina Gray in the first film) The nurses unlock the doors, and discover the murder in progress. They run, but Heather is concerned where Dylan went, the doctor realizes Heather is right. Heather soon remembers home, (previously she comforted Dylan by telling him their home is right across the freeway from the hospital). She discovers a giant Freddy dangling Dylan from above traffic. She arrives home and finds Dylan, but Freddy begins to manipulate the world around her, causing her to become Nancy and her house to become the house on Elm Street. By forcing Heather to accept the role he wants her to play, Freddy rises out from Dylan's bed and is fully in the real world. Heather runs inside and into Dylan's room only to find him gone, and the toy dinosaur Dylan believed was protecting him totally eviscerated by Freddy.Heather takes sleeping pills to join in on a lucid dream, final showdown with Freddy to save an already captured Dylan. It occurs in a hot, steamy and water-logged dreamscape ruin, apparently Freddy's home turf. Dylan finds Heather, only for them both to be attacked by Freddy, Heather is knocked out, Dylan is left in a state of defenselessness.Freddy lures Dylan into a trap and tries to attack him vigorously, Heather discovers the battle and fights off Freddy, but Freddy makes his tongue extend and wrap around her face. Dylan gets out of the trap to save Heather by taking a large kitchen knife that she brought in with her, stabbing Freddy's tongue and making it go back to its previous size. The two succeed in killing Freddy, by locking him in a lit furnace where upon catching on fire, (in a Hansel and Gretel-like ending) his true visage is shown amidst a fiery blast, all the while Dylan & Heather flee said inferno, escaping back to reality, where they find the script of the film Craven has been working on, waiting for them. Dylan asks his mother to read some of it to him, which she does: ""We open on an old wooden bench. There's fire and tools, and a man's grimy hands building what's soon revealed as a gleaming set of claws. And the claws are moving now as if awakening from a long and unwanted sleep...."""

Dorey's boyfriend and neighbor, Bryan Bedford, does his best to convince Susan to believe. While being babysat by Kris one night, she shares her Christmas wish with him. She would like a dad, a house (used every year for the Cole's catalog photoshoot) and a baby brother. He asks her if she got all those things, she would then begin to believe in Santa. She agrees that she would.Kris is credited with bringing in many more sales to Cole's than previous years until one night, when he is arrested and sectioned for supposedly assaulting a man on the street. Later, the truth emerges, that the man he assaulted was Tony, who set him up to be arrested, with the help of staff from Shopper's Express.With the help of Bryan, Dorey pushes Kris' case to court, and drums up support from him from the public. It soon becomes clear that to get him acquitted and freed, Bryan must prove that not only does Santa exist, but that Kris is the real one. It is a seemingly impossible task until he comes up with a plan that requires some help from Susan. The next day in court the proceeding is interrupted by her giving Judge Henry Harper a Christmas card with a $1 bill inside. He notices a red circle on a specific part of it, which says ""In God We Trust"". He realizes that it was issued like all money by the government which represents the people, and if they can believe in God enough to have this message printed on legal tender on faith alone without any physical proof then by that same logic he can say that Santa exists in the form of Kris Kringle.Following the court case, Dorey and Bryan are manipulated by Kris into realizing their true feelings for each other, and married in a very small ceremony after the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass. On Christmas morning, Susan wakes to the news of the marriage and is elated to see that she has part one of her Christmas wish, a dad. Together, Susan, Dorey, and Bryan drive out to the catalog house and upon arrival, they find that Kris has arranged for them to purchase it. Susan, now having got two out of three of her wishes, excitedly runs into the house to look at her bedroom. Dorey and Bryan ask her what part three of her Christmas wish was, and she triumphantly announces that it was a baby brother. They both look at each other, shocked, before glancing down at Dorey's stomach. The film ends with the belief that Susan has now gained all three of her Christmas wishes."

Andre,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109120/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The true story of how a seal named Andre befriended a little girl named Toni and her family in 1962. Toni Whitney and her family adopt a baby seal named Andre. When he grows up and starts getting into mischief, he antagonizes some of the fisherman in town. One of them, Billy Baker, is upset with the Whitneys because Toni's father, Harry, was appointed Harbor Master instead of him, partially because of Andre. But when Andre's humorous antics attracts media attention, further squeezing out Billy, and running down his business, he gets even more upset.—Brian W Martz <B.Martz@Genie.com> In 1962 in Rockport, Maine, a seal drowns in a fishing net cast by financially struggling fisherman Billy Baker (Keith Szarabajka), much to his fury. He and the other local fishermen discuss shooting the seals as a way to improve their flagging fishing season. Toni Whitney (Tina Majorino), a seven-year-old girl, and her family subsequently adopt the seal's orphaned newborn pup, naming it Andre. The vet doesn't hold out much hope, but Toni incites him to survive, with the promise that she will be his best friend forever, and that she will always take care of him. After several failed attempts to get him to take a bottle, Toni's father, Harry (Keith Carradine), the harbor master, constructs an ""artificial mother"" for him out of wet-suit material, a bucket, and two feeding bottles, which he finally accepts, ensuring his survival.As Andre grows up, Toni forms an inseparable bond with him, even taking him to school for show and tell, with the help of Harry and the permission of her teacher. He becomes attached to the Whitneys, and especially to Toni. He lives in the harbor, learns tricks, and attracts a huge local following of fans. The irony of his success as an entertainer further angers Billy, who becomes increasingly jealous of Andre's and the Whitneys' success and esteem within the village. Relations between Harry and Billy deteriorate rapidly. Meanwhile, Billy's son, Mark (Joshua Jackson), and Toni's sister, Paula (Aidan Pendleton), become romantically involved, increasing tension between Paula and Harry over Andre. Mark and Billy have a strained relationship as it is. Under pressure from his family and the locals, Harry reluctantly makes the decision to release Andre into the wild once he is weaned, but reconsiders and does not go through with it when he encounters the body of a seal covered in bullet holes at the place where he had planned to release him.In his first winter, Andre escapes the confines of the barn, and the water home that Harry built for him when the harbor froze over. He cuts himself badly, leaving a trail of blood which the Whitneys discover upon realizing that he is missing, and remains gone for the winter. However, he returns in spring, physically weak but unchanged in character, and recovers quickly from his ordeal.As Andre gets older, he continues to be scapegoat for the local fishermen, and for Paula, as he takes up more and more of Harry's time and affections. He misses her performance (which he told her he would not miss for the world) in the local Miss Liberty beauty pageant, because he has to protect Andre from a drunken Billy, who is trying to kill him with a pitchfork. Harry's relations with his son, Steve (Shane Meier), fade into the background as he comes down harshly on him for minor transgressions, and fails to keep up with what is going on in his life. When Paula and Mark are discovered smoking in the shed when Andre exits it in a fit of coughing, Harry permanently bans Mark's presence on the Whitneys' grounds, and his and Paula's relationship. Paula decides she is leaving home, raging that Harry doesn't care about her, and that she hates him, to the anger and deep concern of her mother, Thalice (Chelsea Field). Mark tells her he knows a way to make Andre go away so that he'll never come back.Harry's job also suffers. He fails to call meetings, never checks moorings, and his relations with the fishermen become ever more strained. He also attracts the ongoing attention of the federal government, who send their inspector, Jack Adams, to inform him that he is violating the law by keeping a wild animal in captivity, as a pet. He insists that Andre is there by his own choice, but that it's too dangerous in the wild during winter. Jack pays two visits to the Whitneys' home, increasingly emphatic that Harry faces court and even jail if he does not give Andre up. However, Andre is teaching him about the intelligence and abilities of seals, and despite the risks, he is determined that nothing will put an end to this learning curve. At one point Andre saves his life when he is underwater checking a mooring, which turns out to be entangled in an active explosive.Eventually, Thalice manages to impress upon Harry the high cost of continuing his relations with Andre in the setup that they have, and he agrees to call Jack, so that he can relocate Andre to the aquarium in Boston, where he will be safe, cared for, and have plenty of company. However, before he can tell Toni, the telephone rings, and she goes down to the harbor. There she discovers that Paula and Mark have taken Andre, commandeered a boat, and are heading out to sea as dark clouds gather. Steve is charged with keeping an eye on Toni while their parents investigate, but he is engrossed in a TV program, and does not notice her slip out and launch the dinghy onto an increasingly choppy sea.On their boat, Mark attempts to shoot Andre, reasoning that he is a problem for the fishermen, but Paula finally realizes that she cares about Andre and doesn't want him to be harmed. She tries to stop Mark from shooting him, but the gun fires. Andre jumps overboard, but Paula, not seeing this, assumes his body has fallen in. Very upset and angry at Mark, she demands to be taken home. Harry and Thalice, having been informed by Toni that Paula and Mark had taken Andre, meet them on the shore. Steve, in a panic, arrives and tells Thalice that Toni has disappeared, as has the dinghy. She calls the coast guard, as the rain starts to fall, and visibility begins to deteriorate.Out at sea, Toni is struggling to maintain control of the dinghy in the face of the storm and a strong outward tide-rush. The dinghy is being tossed on huge waves, in opaque rain, and is heading towards some jagged rocks. She loses both oars, and, panicking, calls out for help. Andre, who turns out to be unharmed, swims to her rescue, pulling her away from the rocks by the dinghy's mooring rope. He then alerts Billy and Harry in their boat, leading them to Toni's location. Before she can be rescued, a large wave capsizes the dinghy. Mark, who came with Billy and Harry, jumps overboard, swims out to her, and Billy throws them both a lifebelt, pulling them to safety. Billy tells Mark that he is proud of him, while Harry comforts Toni in the back of the boat, and Andre swims away, exultant at her safety.Once back on shore, Toni is distraught to find Jack levering a caged Andre onto a transport vehicle. Harry explains to her that Andre is going to live in the aquarium in Boston, where he will be safe and cared for in ways they can't. Annie Potts, an aquarium worker, tells Toni they will take good care of him, that they will love having him there, and that she will get to visit him whenever she wants. She reluctantly accepts the notion, and tells Andre that she loves him and will visit him all the time.As summer comes around, Billy and Mark's relationship improves. Harry repairs relations with his family, and having been offered a research job in marine mammal protection, steps down as harbor master, nominating Billy to take his place. Toni comes to the realization that Andre would be happier in the wild, being a wild animal, and he is subsequently released. The Whitneys do not expect to see him again, and Toni wonders if he is making new friends with the wild seals. Multiple alleged sightings of Andre are reported, until a friend of the Whitneys spots him nearby, and informs them that he is on his way. The entire town of Rockport flocks to the harbor to watch him returning home to his family. The film ends with an adult Toni narrating that his life became legend after he made his first trip home, that he spent every winter at the aquarium, and every spring he was released to swim home to Rockport. She narrates that by the time he was twenty-four years old he could hardly see, but still made his final trip home, and that in all her past and future, she'll never have a better friend than him."

Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and is just about to appear in the social pages of the newspaper. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as his parents; especially the three enterprising kidnappers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnapping him, they have a harder time keeping hold of him, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than them.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Posing as experienced baby photographers, the incompetent Mafioso, Eddie, and his equally maladroit henchmen, Norby and Veeko, manage to snatch adorable nine-month-old Baby Bink right under the noses of his mother, Laraine, and nanny, Gilbertine. However, keeping the seemingly helpless hostage imprisoned is easier said than done, as he proves to be more resourceful, and a lot more intelligent than his desperate captors. Now a frenzied hunt for him begins against the backdrop of Chicago's bustling and dangerous streets. How will his exciting day out in the city finish?—Nick Riganas Bennington Austin ""Bink"" Cotwell Jr. (Adam and Jacob Worton), a mischievous baby who lives in a huge mansion in a suburb of Chicago with his parents Laraine (Lara Flynn Boyle) and Bennington Sr. (Matthew Glave), is just about to appear in the social pages of the newspaper. Three klutzy would-be kidnappers: Edgar ""Eddie"" Mauser (Joe Mantegna), Norbert ""Norby"" LeBlaw (Joe Pantoliano), and Victor ""Veeko"" Riley (Brian Haley) disguise themselves as the photographers from the paper and kidnap him. After the kidnapping they have difficulty controlling him. While trying to get Bink to fall asleep, Norby does so reading Bink's book titled ""Baby's Day Out"", leaving him unattended. Looking through it, Bink notices a bird on the page and then one by the open window. He follows it out and successfully gets away from his kidnappers, with Eddie falling off the building and into a garbage bin while chasing after him through the rooftop.The FBI arrives at the mansion, headed by Dale Grissom (Fred Thompson), where they try to piece together clues along with Bink's parents and his loving nanny Gilbertine (Cynthia Nixon). Meanwhile, he, now outside on the ground and crawling about, finds another part of his book: The blue bus, which he then boards. The kidnappers realize he is missing and start chasing the bus in their van but their efforts are in vain. Meanwhile on the bus Bink crawls into the bag of an obese lady who gets off at her stop shortly afterwards. By the time the trio catches it, and realize Bink is not on board, they then realize that he crawled into the lady's bag and follow her. An altercation ensues after they insult her, and while they attempt their escape, Bink crawls up to a revolving door at the entrance to a department store (also featured in his book) and is forced inwards by its momentum.Crawling through the department store, Bink is stopped by a worker (Dawn Maxey) who works for Mother Goose Corner, a nearby day care center, who believes he escaped from there. While unattended there, he crawls into the bottom of a stroller and is wheeled out by an unsuspecting mother, leaving the store, he crawls out from the stroller and eventually ends up in traffic. The kidnappers attempt to follow him but get their feet run over by a passing truck and jump into a giant ditch as he makes his way to the city zoo. They find him in the primate house with a gorilla, and lose hope of gaining their ransom money. The gorilla shows a maternal side and does not injure him. The kidnappers try to retrieve Baby Bink but she notices them and bashes Veeko's hand, throws Norby into the air using a mop-stick as a catapult, and hurls Eddie against the bars of the cage opposite her own.The kidnappers eventually corner and catch Bink in the zoo's park, but are confronted by two friendly police officers, who have noticed that their van's engine is still running. During the conversation, Eddie hides Bink under his coat in his lap, but he reaches Eddie's cigarette lighter, sets his crotch on fire, and sneaks off as soon as the officers are gone. Veeko extinguishes the fire by repeatedly stomping on Eddie's groin, seriously hurting him. They follow Bink to a construction yard, but are still unable to catch him, with Norby falling into a vat of wet cement, Veeko getting thrown off the building and into the back of a garbage truck, and Eddie getting stranded on a crane after being drenched in glue. The sun sets as Bink leaves the construction yard. The kidnappers manage to escape (offscreen), but decide to give up and go home.Bink's parents are notified of various sightings of him in the city and Gilbertine deduces that he has been following the happenings of his favorite book, (or ""Boo-Boo"", as Bink calls it) and will most likely head for the Old Soldiers' Home next. Sure enough, they find him there, but on the way home, he begins to call out ""Boo-Boo"" toward the kidnappers' flat. The FBI moves in on there and arrests the three villains demanding that they return his book first.
Back home, Bink is put to bed by his family. As his parents discuss having his picture taken by a normal photographer in the morning, he wakes up and gets ready to read another book, this one entitled Baby's Trip to China."

He explains that after his mentor Ramirez was killed by the Kurgan, and his wife died through old age, he searched the world, ""looking for answers."" His journeys brought him to Japan where he became tutored in his immortal powers in the cave of Nakano the sorcerer. It is there that he and Nakano forge a katana which Conner now uses. The two battle in a training montage, and Conner gains the upper hand despite Nakano's illusions. Nakano invites him to destroy him so that Conner may receive his power, but Conner refuses since his friendship with Nakano is too great. Nakano warns Conner of the evil immortal named Kane, who is on his way with his two lackeys to the mountain of Neri where Conner and Nakano currently reside. On his way to the mountain, he passes through a Japanese village and asks for directions, but upon receiving none, Kane and his men brutally massacre every man, woman, and child within the village before setting it ablaze and continuing their journey. Kane and his men arrive at Nakano's cave and attack him. Conner tries to intervene but is impaled by Kane and defeated. Nakano distracts Kane with his illusions while Conner escapes, but Kane quickly gains the upper hand and decapitates Nakano. Before dying, Nakano tells Kane that Conner will eventually destroy him. Nakano's quickening, while powering Kane, cause a great explosion within the cave that causes to to seal up when the boulders break loose and cover up the entrances while Conner barely escapes the ensuing avalanche.In present day 1994, an excavation is taking place at Mount Neri. Beautiful blonde archaeologist, Dr. Alexandra Johnson, arrives and shows fascinations in the excavation knowing that they have discovered a cave that belonged to the ancient sorcerer Nakano. That night, a security guard investigates a noise coming from a tunnel and is killed by Kane who emerges with his lackeys. He sends the first lackey to find the Highlander Conner and kill him. As the first lackey leaves, Kane immediately decapitates the second lackey and receives his quickening. Meanwhile, Conner is enjoying a vacation in Marrakesh with his adopted plot device son, when he realizes a sensation of the quickening. Realizing that his son is in mortal danger (immortal danger I guess now), Conner leaves his son in the care of his friend before returning to his home in New York City. On his way to his home, he is attacked and shot by several muggers and left for dead in the snow. He is quickly brought to the hospital but comes alive and inadvertently attacks the paramedics, leading to him being brought to the mental institution.Conner awakens tied to a bed alongside a crazy mental patient who believes that he is Napoleon Bonaparte and has a newspaper hat to go with him. Conner uses this patient's delusions to convince him to set him free and start a commotion which arrests the attention of the security guards. Conner then makes his way to the laundry room and is attacked by Kane's first lackey. In a swift but fierce battle, Conner decapitates the lackey with his own sword and receives his quickening. He escapes the mental institution and the lackey's body is discovered by the police as well as Detective John Stenn, who is obsessed with bringing down Conner who he believes is the perpetrator of the act.At the dig site in Japan, Alex finds the dead body of Kane's first lackey in the tunnels and recognizes his armor as authentic 1500 Japanese armor, quickly taking a sample. She does further research and deduces that the sample is ""definitely not a fake."" Meanwhile, Kane arrives in New York, and begins catching up on lost time by stealing a person's sunglasses, visiting a grungy bar, and then a brothel where he has rough sex with a saucy prostitute until he inadvertently kills her. Upon returning home, Conner is held up by Stenn, who warns him that he will bring him down, calling him by his alias, Russel Nash. ""I'll nail ya Nash!"" he says, to which Conner is disgusted by.Conner looks through his apartment where he turns on the news to a News interview of Alex, to which he realizes that she is bewitchingly similar in physical appearance to an old love he once had in the 1700's named Rebecca. In an admittedly clever scene, Stenn visits the autopsy room where the coroner is unable to determine the second lackey's identity due to him being previously immortal and having no life in the present day for centuries. Finding nothing against Conner, Stenn leaves in an angry huff. Meanwhile, Alex deduces that an iron she found in the excavation belongs to Conner MacLeod, and upon further research, finds out the ""Russel Nash"" is a possible ""link to Nakano."" Upon receiving his address, she decides to head to New York where he lives to ask him some questions. Unbeknownst to her, Kane has arrived and has overheard. He appears and playfully harasses her before transforming into a hawk and flying off to find Conner as well as soon as the faxed address to Conner's home is revealed.Alex arrives in New York and tails Conner to a Buddhist shrine where he has been practicing Martial Arts. Stenn follows close behind. While there, Conner has a flashback of his love with Rebecca in France, and how they made passionate love in the barn before the French Revolution broke out. Conner was rounded up during the madness and was sent to prison to be executed by the guillotine, but in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" fashion, another immortal swaps places with him. Later, Conner returns to Rebecca's home only to discover that she had married another man upon belief that Conner had been killed. With his heart broken, Conner left. After the flashback has subsided, Conner then runs into Alex and discovers that she has been following him, immediately suspecting that she is trying to discover his link to MacLeod. Just then they are attacked by Kane. Conner and Kane begin a sword duel to which Conner is defeated and his swords is cleaved in half by Kane. However, before Kane can go in for the kill, he realizes that they have been fighting on holy ground. Kane transforms into a hawk and flies off.Conner, gathering himself up and finding that his sword is broken, orders Alex to leave him alone and leaves in a huff. Stenn runs into Alex, hoping to arrest Conner. He then brings her to a bar and tells her of Conner's last wife Brenda who was killed in a car crash which Conner survived. (Which makes little to no sense considering that Conner was made mortal after defeating the Kurgan, but, oh well) Conner journeys back to Scotland in hopes of reforging his sword. To his delight, he finds his ancient tools and anvil, and tries futilely to fix his weapon. Finally lost hope, he ponders his life while Alex researches and finds that Nakano's magic metal bar of refined steel. She journeys to Scotland and gives him the medal which he graciously accepts and through a training montage set to Lorene McKennit's ""Bonny Portmore."" Having reforged his sword, Conner and Alex celebrate by going back to his apartment where he gets naked and takes off Alex's lingerie, sucking her nipple, fingering her, thrusting into her and having sex with her until she mounts him and climaxes vigorously.The next day while at a pub, Conner receives a call from his friend telling him that he sent MacLeod's now-forgotten by both Conner and every viewer of the film to the airport. Conner races to the airport and tries to reclaim his son, but Kane beats him there, and making himself look like Conner, takes Conner's son and kidnaps him. Stenn arrives at the airport and arrests Conner but cannot get any evidence against him, and with Conner being unresponsive, has to let him go. ""I'll nail ya Nash!"" he reminds Conner, to which Conner laughs and says, ""I've heard that before.""Conner, knowing he may die in the ensuing battle, gives Alex the ring he gave to Rebecca centuries ago, to which she emotionally accepts. Conner tracks down Kane at an abandoned cathedral where Kane reveals that Conner will only receive his characterless son after Conner has defeated him. He then tries to break down Conner via a speech of how the prize was never Conner's to begin with. But Conner is unswayed. Kane then flees to an abandoned nuclear power plant where Kane tries to distract Conner by posing as a terribly dubbed Alex. However, Conner is not fooled and stabs Kane to which Kane just uses the word and attacks Conner. In a badly edited battle with Motley Crew's instrumental cover of ""Dr. Feelgood"" blaring in the background, Conner reclaims his sword and cuts Kane in halves, only for Kane to put himself back together and keep fighting. Conner manages to cuts Kane's back legs, distracting Kane into regenerating himself. Kane turns and tells Conner, ""I'll see you in hell!"" To which the Highlander smiles and says curtly, ""I'll be the judge of that."" Kane attacks him once more but Conner decapitates Kane three times so that Kane cannot regenerate himself. As Kane's head rolls across the ground, Conner states defiantly, ""There can be only one!""Then, Kane's quickening floods the factory and imbues its flaming power into Conner MacLeod, who is swept into the air and filled with the definite final quickening. He collapses to the ground and is greeted by his now restored son. Conner returns to the grave of his first wife, Heather, and leaves a candle there by his planted sword in remembrance. Conner then happily states that all immortals are definitely done in for, and that his conflict is ""finally over."" As he drives off into the peaceful countryside with his son and Alex, the screen focuses upon his planted sword. Ambiguously, lightning strikes his sword in a reference of the quickening, implying that his conflict is NOT over and that there are indeed more immortals to be reckoned with."

Co-written with siblings Joie and Cinqué Lee, Spike Lee's CROOKLYN is a semi-autobiographical portrait illuminating the life of the lively Carmichael family and their vibrant Bedford-Stuyvesant community. Schoolteacher and loving Carmichael matriarch Carolyn (Alfre Woodard) runs a no-nonsense household, working hard to keep the lights on and raise her nine-year-old daughter Troy (Zelda Harris) alongside her 4 rowdy brothers with little help from her sensitive, struggling jazz-musician husband Woody (Delroy Lindo). Troy proves adept at holding her own while navigating adolescence amid the fertile chaos of one dynamic Brooklyn summer in 1973.

The argument ends as Vic Powell (Isaiah Washington), a Vietnam war vet, comes home and greets everyone. Vic is renting the upstairs apartment from the Carmichaels. Troy and her friends are sitting on a stoop at the same time having on and off arguments before deciding to jump-rope.

This causes his brothers to make fun of him and rub it in his face telling him how good their cake is. Joseph's cake is eaten by the family dog Mutley, so Nate's piece of cake is split in half by Woody to share between Nate and Joseph. Carolyn, tired of standing at the table waiting for Nate to eat, tells him one last time to finish his black-eyed-peas.

Wendell is taking the trash out and decides to take some of it in Tony Eyes' area.Carolyn comes out to see what is wrong, and Tony Eyes tells her that Wendell and her kids are always throwing trash into his area. Carolyn responds by telling him that he and his home are nasty. The arguments continue as the neighborhood kids jump in.

Go sniff on your own block.""In the middle of the night, Troy is sleeping, but she is restless as she dreams she's hearing her mother's voice shouting. She goes downstairs to tell her mother to please stop fighting only to find that it is her father who is making a lot of noise trying to kill a rat in the kitchen. Woody tells her that her mother is gone and that it's ok to cry. Troy runs to the bathroom and throws up as Woody comes into the bathroom to console her. Troy tells him that she wants to stay with him and not move away with her Aunt Maxine and Uncle Brown. Troy asks Woody if Carolyn was in a lot of pain, and he tells her that she was. Troy states, ""Then it's good that she died so she wouldn't suffer anymore.There are scenes of the neighborhood continuing to play much like the beginning of the movie. Troy is sitting in Carolyn's chair with Joseph sitting on her while she combs his hair the way Carolyn did. Then, Carolyn is sitting the stoop seemingly narrating a letter she wrote to Troy telling her she can't believe that she's 10 now, that she misses her very much, and how she's proud of the way she's growing up. The memory is interrupted when the neighborhood kids come to the window and asks Troy if Joseph can come out and play. Troy tells him not to go far because dinner is almost ready. The last scene is of the neighborhood being watched by Troy as she's looking out the window much like Carolyn used to do."
Bullets Over Broadway,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109348/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In New York in 1928, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced. 1920s Broadway. Playwright David Shayne considers himself an artist, and surrounds himself with like minded people, most struggling financially as they create art for themselves, not the masses. David, however, believes the failure of his first two plays was because he gave up creative control to other people who didn't understand the material. As such, he wants to direct his just completed third play, ""God of Our Fathers"", insider scuttlebutt being that it may very well make David the toast of Broadway. With David having no directing history, David's regular producer, Julian Marx, can't find any investors,... until a single investor who will finance the entire production comes onto the scene. He is Nick Valenti, a big time mobster, with the catch being that his dimwitted girlfriend, non-actress Olive Neal, get the lead role. A hesitant David and Julian, who are able to talk Nick into them giving Olive one of the two female supporting roles instead, go along with the scheme hoping that the three other actors hired will be able to make up for any deficiencies posed by Olive. What makes Olive's situation worse for David is that Nick has placed a bodyguard named Cheech - a typical thug who kills if need be - on Olive, he a constant presence at the theater during rehearsals. David is unaware or mindfully ignorant of issues concerning the other actors. Helen Sinclair, who has the lead, is a diva of an actress, who hasn't had a hit in years. Regardless, she is slyly manipulating David to make the role more glamorous befitting her real life persona than the frigid character he has written. Gossip is that Warner Purcell, the only male among the cast, has a roller coaster of a weight problem. Currently on a low, Warner tends to eat and eat and eat when when he gets stressed. And Eden Brent, a happy-go-lucky actress, has a constant companion in her pet chihuahua, Mr. Woofulls, whose presence is a constant thorn in Helen's side. With one problem after another during rehearsals, one event seems to have the potential to turn the production around on a permanent upswing,... that is if David goes along with it, he resisting if only because it would mean that his artistic vision was wrong. Regardless, there is still the potential for something to go violently wrong with Nick solely looking out for Olive's interest, and Cheech a constant presence, he seeing and hearing everything that is happening.—Huggo New York, 1928. David Shayne is a playwright and his last two movies have bombed. He has a new play and wants to direct it himself. However, he is unable to find a financier for his play until Nick Valenti comes along.

Things are about to get very complicated.—grantss Set in 1920's New York City, this movie tells the story of idealistic young playwright David Shayne. Producer Julian Marx finally finds funding for the project from gangster Nick Valenti. The catch is that Nick's girl friend Olive Neal gets the part of a psychiatrist, and Olive is a bimbo who could never pass for a psychiatrist as well as being a dreadful actress. Agreeing to this first compromise is the first step to Broadway's complete seduction of David, who neglects longtime girl friend Ellen. Meanwhile David puts up with Warner Purcell, the leading man who is a compulsive eater, Helen Sinclair, the grand dame who wants her part jazzed up, and Cheech, Olive's interfering hitman / bodyguard. Eventually, the playwright must decide whether art or life is more important.—Reid Gagle David Shayne, a neurotic playwright, has just found a way to have his play produced. Mob boss Nick Valenti has faith that the play will bring in big bucks.

When the cast is introduced to Cheech's rewrite (thinking it's David's) David starts getting amazing compliments.

However, when her drag queen friend Mitzi receives a last-minute invitation to perform in the backwater town of Alice Springs, she gives herself a break and embarks on a long road trip into the vast Australian outback along with flamboyant cross-dresser Felicia. As the outrageous trio hits the road in their bright-lavender 1976 Hino RC320 bus, the performers attract lots of attention, receive help from total strangers, and crush gender stereotypes. The question is, are these fabulous companions ready to experience the thrill of a real, live Les Girls show?—Nick Riganas It's 1994 in Sydney, Australia, and Tick Belrose is having a rough night. On stage as his drag persona Mitzi Del Bra, his sad ballad doesn't really hit with the audience.Someone actually throws a beer can at his head, triggering his friend Adam, in character as Felicia Jollygoodfellow, to deliver some sick burns to the offending audience member. While recovering backstage, Tick gets a call from a mysterious woman that triggers a flashback - he's in a hospital, wearing a chandelier - and she asks him a favor.After the show, Tick calls his friend Bernadette, who has some shocking news of her own - her partner Trumpet has just died during a slip-and-fall/asphyxiation accident while peroxiding his hair at home. After the funeral, Tick proposes an idea he thinks will be good for both of them: getting the hell out of town. His mystery caller asked him to do a month of shows at a resort in Alice Springs, in the middle of the outback. Bernadette eventually gets on board only to discover that Adam, her very favorite person in the whole world, will be coming along. But in spite of being insufferable, Adam has a silver lining: wealthy parents. Adam tells them that some time in the wild might cure him of his, you know, personality, and they buy him an old tour bus. Meet Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Once they're on the road, our trio gets along for approximately 12 seconds, and then we begin to see that there might be a slight problem with this whole Bernadette and Adam thing. We also learn that the mystery woman is actually Tick's wife.They reach a town called Broken Hill a few days into their drive, and disembark fully kitted out to check into their hotel and then head to the bar (of course). The patrons of the local watering hole range from confused to hostile, especially one woman who is clearly just mad that they're prettier than her. But a stone-cold Bernadette threatens to light that woman's tampon on fire and then beats her in a drinking contest, which seems to settle things for everyone. In the morning, they find that not everyone came around, because someone has painted hateful graffiti on Priscilla.Wanting to shave off a few days, they make the very bad decision to take a shortcut via an unpaved road, which makes for a great opera number from a very silver Adam but apparently also makes for a gas tank and fuel line full of dust.Stranded in the desert, Bernadette goes off in search of help while Adam paints the bus lavender and Tick works on show choreography. After getting ditched by an everything-phobic ranch couple, they are found by an aboriginal man who takes them to a campfire party where they perform for their hosts accompanied by the didgeridoo and even give their rescuer, Alan, a drag makeover that he has a blast with. So apparently not everyone is an asshole, just colonizers.Back at the bus, they make a sex doll kite that brings Bernadette a lot of joy, to help flag down the tow truck guy that Alan hooked them up with.Tow truck guy is Bob, and as it turns out, he's a fan. He somewhat optimistically thinks that his town would just loooooooooove to see a drag show, but really they just want to see his wife shoot ping pong balls out of her nether regions. Cynthia is... complicated.In the aftermath of her performance, Cynthia takes off to live her truth and Bob decides that the best thing for everyone really is if he just comes along on the bus.Bob gets them back on the road, but unfortunately that road takes them to the mining town of Coober Pedy. They need a new gas tank, but they also need to stay in their rooms because even optimistic Bob knows they shouldn't push their luck with these blokes. Adam, of course, will not stand for that. High on a mystery pill and dressed to the nines, he crashes a kegger to antagonistically flirt with people who want to kill him. He takes a rough beating, but Bob and Bernadette find and save him before it gets worse.They keep limping along toward Alice Springs, bonding with Bob, and enjoying the period of time where Adam can't speak because of his injured jaw. They make it there to a warm welcome from the staff and Tick's wife Marion - and Bernadette straight-up passes out when Marion introduces Tick's 8-year-old son Benji.Tick is excited to spend time with Benji, but he's very scared that his son will judge him. After their show, though, he sees that Benji already knows, or knows enough, and enjoys watching him perform.As they settle in, Adam and Tick are shocked that Benji is just... cool with it all. He doesn't judge them, he sees the joy in what they do, he understands that people are gay, he wants to play Lego.After a day trip to fulfill Adam's childhood dream - hiking King Canyon in full drag - and finishing up their show run, they prepare to head out only to discover that Bob and Bernadette are going to stay and try to have a life together. Benji is coming to Sydney to spend some time with his dad and uncle Adam, and on the way they practice singing Mama Mia, leading us into our final sequence with them performing the famous ABBA show back on their home stage. All is finally well (and glittery) with the world. Emily Winsauer - Adventurelings: The Adventure Movie Podcast"

Immortal Beloved,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110116/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The life and death of the legendary Ludwig van Beethoven. Besides all the work he is known for, the composer once wrote a famous love letter to a nameless beloved, and the movie tries to find out who this beloved was--not easy, as Beethoven has had many women in his life.—Smoothhoney1265 Ludwig van Beethoven dies and his assistant/friend Schindler proceeds to deal with his affairs (last will and testament). There is a question as to who really is his ""immortal beloved,"" and so he tries to find out who this might be.—Keven Fedirko <keven.fedirko@corp.softimage.com> Warning: This movie is extraordinarily susceptible to being spoiled.
It is very similar to Citizen Kane in this regard. Please consider
not reading past the 15th paragraph (there will be a warning) until
you have seen the movie.Immortal Beloved is a biographical account of Ludwig van Beethoven's
(Gary Oldman) life and loves, in the form of a fictionalized treatment
of an enigmatic letter to his ""immortal beloved"" that was found after
his death. (The letter, the mystery about the addressee's identity,
and a great many other aspects of Beethoven's life, are treated
reasonably authentically in the movie. But the identity of the
""immortal beloved"" indicated in the movie should be regarded as
fictional.)The movie is structured like Citizen Kane---a mystery is revealed upon
Beethoven's death, and the movie is a long series of flashbacks
through Beethoven's life as his secretary and confidant Anton
Schindler (Jeroen Krabbé) scours the countryside attempting to solve
the matter. The mystery is the discovery of an unofficial will
found among Beethoven's papers upon his death, bequeathing all
his property to an unnamed ""immortal beloved"", along with a passionate
love letter to her. Schindler vows to find out who she was, and thus
carry out Beethoven's last wish, keenly aware of how society had
failed Beethoven throughout his life. He is opposed in this by
Beethoven's surviving brother Johann (Gerard Horan) and Johann's wife
Therese (Alexandra Pigg), who feel that the estate should be theirs,
based on an earlier official will, and as compensation for the abuse
they endured from Ludwig.Schindler (Anton Schindler really was Beethoven's secretary and
assistant, and apparently really was as sycophantic in real life as
his depiction in the movie) sets out for the hotel in Karlsbad where
the letter was sent. During this journey, a voice-over recites part
of the letter, while the slow 2nd movement of Beethoven's 5th
(""Emperor"") piano concerto plays. The letter explains his ardent love
for this woman, while explaining that he has been delayed, by a
serious coach breakdown, from seeing her.The proprietress, Frau Streicher (Miriam Margolyes), tells him that
Beethoven had indeed come there many years before to stay with a woman
who had checked in earlier. This woman did not give her name, and
covered herself in a veil at all times. A letter from Beethoven
arrived, and she took it to the room, along with a meal, after opening
it to find out what room it should go to---""Immortal beloved"" was not
an adequate address. The woman apparently did not like the letter,
because she checked out shortly thereafter. Then Beethoven arrived,
saw that the woman had left, and went on a rampage, destroying
furniture and breaking a window. An extensive search of the hotel's
past registry books yields the page on which the woman signed in, but
the name is illegible. Frau Streicher lets Schindler tear out the page
and take it with him.Schindler then goes to see various women who were known to have been
personally involved with Beethoven, beginning with Giulietta
Guicciardi (Valeria Golino). She tells Schindler of her fascination
with Beethoven, her desire to marry him, and his rather eccentric and
boorish behavior. Because Beethoven was rumored to be extremely shy
about performing on the piano (the real reason was his approaching
deafness) she arranges to have a very new and expensive piano brought
to the house, and she tells Beethoven that everyone will be away and
he can try it out. He does so, playing the Moonlight Sonata while his
head is pressed against the top of the piano so that he can hear it as
well as possible. Giulietta, along with her father
(Luigi Diberti), have been hiding an an adjacent room. She is so
moved by his playing that she comes out of hiding, walks up to
Beethoven without his seeing her, and touches him. Beethoven recoils
in horror, shouting ""It is terrible to rob me in this way of my most
treasured feelings"". It soon becomes clear to Giulietta and her
father that Beethoven is deaf. Shortly afterwards, Giulietta married
Count Gallenburg, another composer.Schindler returns to Vienna and runs into Ludwig's brother Johann, who
reminds him that Ludwig cared only for himself, and wanted to control
other people to keep them serving him. As a case in point, when the
third brother Caspar (Christopher Fulford) (who had died earlier) was
to marry Johanna Reiss (Johanna ter Steege), Ludwig expressed his
strong disdain for the union, making extremely crude statements: ""By
all means, copulate with her. But marriage? Every farmhand in the
region has enjoyed her for free. Why should you pay more?"" Just
after the marriage, Ludwig sends the police to their apartment,
confronting them in bed and commanding the police to ""Arrest that
whore"". Caspar shows the marriage license, and also explains that
Johanna is pregnant. Ludwig becomes bitterly estranged from Caspar
and Johanna for years after that. Johann explains to Schindler that
Ludwig was just as strongly opposed to his own marriage to Therese,
and just as abusive to them.Schindler's travels then take him to Hungary for a meeting with
Countess Anna Marie Erdody (Isabella Rossellini), who fills in a lot more
of the history. She had been present during the disastrous premiere
of the Emperor Concerto, in which Beethoven's deafness made him unable
to keep the orchestra together, and hence the world first truly
learned of his malady. Anna took him in at her palace, and they lived
together for a few years. She said that those were probably the
happiest years of both of their lives, that she loved him, but that
Beethoven did not seem to truly love her. These years included the
horrifying siege of Vienna by Napoleon's troops, during which one of
Anna's three children was killed.Schindler himself takes up the flashback narrative at this point,
continuing his conversation with Countess Erdody. He describes how
he, as a budding violinist, first met Beethoven at a rehearsal of the
""Kreutzer"" sonata. And how Beethoven explained his ideas of the
meaning of music, and that this particular piece is about a person
trying to reach his lover by coach, but the coach broke down in
bad weather, causing great despair. Schindler did not realize at the
time that this was what would be described in the ""immortal beloved""
letter.During this period, Beethoven became convinced that his brother Caspar
had taken some of his manuscripts, and went to confront him. They
hadn't spoken in 8 years, and things started off well, until Ludwig
started forcibly going through Caspar's papers, and also referring to
Johanna as ""this foul slut you call a wife."" A violent fight ensues,
to the horror of Schindler, Johanna, and their 8-year-old son Karl
(Matthew North). When Ludwig leaves, Caspar is profusely coughing
up blood, and in fact dies a few months later. At the interment,
Ludwig remarks to Shindler that Johanna seems to be seeing another man
already. ""My brother's bed is not yet cold and he is climbing in.""Ludwig then takes legal action against Johanna, to take custody of
Karl, on the grounds that she is of low moral character. Just before
the police take Karl away, Johanna tells Karl not to believe anything
that Ludwig says about her; it is all lies.Karl stays with Ludwig, who plans to make Karl into a great pianist.
Ludwig relates to Karl that his own father had tried, unssuccessfully,
to do the same with him, to make him the new Mozart. After Ludwig had
failed at this, the flashback shows his father administering a brutal
thrashing, and strongly suggesting that Ludwig's hearing loss had been
caused by this.A further legal battle ensues because Ludwig suspects that Johanna is
bribing people to allow her to visit Karl in secret. There is a highly
public trial, and Beethoven even bribes Metternich (Barry Humphries),
by promising to write an oratorio for him, a promise that he never
kept. Metternich intercedes on Beethoven's behalf, and he wins the case.Beethoven's squalid living style and generally disagreeable character
are depicted at length. Karl, a young adult at this point
(Marco Hofschneider), had been scheduled by Ludwig to give a public
piano recital, and he tells Schindler that he is ""at the end of his
tether."" He knows that he is a very mediocre pianist, but Ludwig, due
to his deafness, can not, or will not, accept that. He also relates
Ludwig's increasingly bizarre behavior, including incessantly singing
some tune, claiming that is the motif of a grand symphony. Karl sings
it (badly)---it's the main choral theme (Ode to Joy) of the 9th symphony.Schindler and Karl both go to Ludwig to talk him out of his plan.
Beethoven verbally abuses Schindler, telling him to get out.Karl, truly at the end of his tether at this point, takes a dueling
pistol and attempts to kill himself. He is a very bad shot, and
injures himself but does not die. He is taken to his mother's
upholstery shop. Beethoven and Schindler both go there. Karl writes to
Beethoven (everyone was communicating with him by writing in notebooks
or on small slates) ""Never show your face to me again"". Ludwig's
desolation is complete. He is universally despised for what he had
driven Karl to. He is shown being physically abused on the street by
young hooligans, who beat him senseless. The scene ends with him
lying unconscious in the street.WARNING: SPOILER COMING UP.The biographical flashbacks end. Schindler explains to Countess
Erdody his reason for the visit; he needs to know who was the
""immortal beloved"" in the letter. The Countess says ""The letter was
not written to me."" ""Then who?"" ""It was she who came between us. He
could not forget her."" ""Who is she?"" ""The answer was always in front
of you."" She tells him, off camera, who she was. He gets into his
coach, not knowing what to do. She says ""Go to her"".Schindler is then seen entering Johanna Reiss's upholstery shop. He
asks to speak to her in private. She is quite cold to him, but he
implores her. They go upstairs. He asks to see a sample of her
handwriting. She continues to be hostile, but he persuades her. He
then brings out the page from the hotel register and sees that the
handwriting matches. She demands to know what that page is. ""A page
from a hotel registry in Karlsbad, signed by you. Did you ever meet
Ludwig in Karlsbad?"" ""You can hardly be unaware of the manner in which
I suffered at his hands. I find the question as insulting as it is
impudent. What are you implying?"" Her hostility eventually subsides,
and she explains that she had made peace with him, in her own mind,
because of the Ode to Joy (9th Symphony.) ""I could not hate the man
who could write such music.""The final three flashbacks follow. The first is the premiere
performance of the 9th Symphony. Beethoven walks up on stage at some
point (another conductor was at the podium), and stares blankly at the
musicians, being unable to hear the performance. He becomes lost in a
personal reverie. He is hearing the Ode to Joy in is mind
during this. He recalls an incident as a child when he ran away from
his violently abusive father. He runs through the woods while the 9th
Symphony plays. (This scene solves the problem of depicting
Beethoven's deafness while treating the audience to his music. He
can't hear the concert, but the Symphony is played as he runs through
the woods in his fantasy.) He finally reaches a small pond, and, just
at the big crescendo of the Ode to Joy, lies down in the water and is
shown in a cosmic oneness with the heavens.At the end of the cosmic scene, we are brought back to the concert
hall. The Symphony has ended, though Beethoven doesn't realize it.
The sound track has been turned off to depict his deafness. The
audience is silently applauding, but Beethoven doesn't see them. Then
the conductor turns Beethoven around, so he can see the audience, who
leap to their feet with loud and thunderous applause.In the second of the final flashbacks, Johanna visits Beethoven on his
deathbed, and he writes out a document transferring guardianship of
Karl back to her. They hold hands briefly in apparent awareness of
their lost love.Finally, Johanna tells Schindler ""Yes, I once loved him. But he
turned his back on me. I never heard a word from him. I was a fool.
I never meant anything to him."" ""But, the letter."" ""What letter?""
After a long pause, Schindler realizes that she never saw the
letter. He gives it to her.Schindler leaves, and we see her sobbing in the window as she reads
Beethoven's letter to his immortal beloved. The slow movement of the
Emperor Concerto is played one last time, with one last narration of
the letter. The final flashback shows what had happened.My angel, my all, my other self ... If we could be united, we would
feel this pain no longer ... Soon, we shall live together, and what a
life it will be.All the time that Caspar was courting her, she was actually sleeping
with Ludwig. He comes to visit Johanna at her upholstery shop. She
is afraid that Caspar will catch them. He says that he can no longer
skulk around like a guilty schoolboy. They agree to meet at a hotel
in Karlsbad. She tells him that she is carrying his child. (That
would be Karl!)She arrives at the hotel, but, because of a terrible storm, Beethoven
is delayed. It is at this point that he writes the letter, and sends
it on ahead of him.The journey was dreadful ... The coach had to go and break down on
such a terrible road for no reason ... and now I am held up
completely.The letter arrives, and Frau Streicher places it on a food tray, but
nearly hidden under a plate of pastry.I have to see you ... However much you love me, I love you more.Johanna takes the lid off a tureen of not-very-appetizing stew, and
becomes nauseous. (She is presumably experiencing morning sickness.)
Because of that, the terrible storm, and the belief that Beethoven has
stood her up, she despairs of the situation and checks out. She never
sees the letter.I must go to sleep now. Be calm, love. Today, yesterday.
What longing with tears for you.Beethoven arrives, sees that she has left, and goes on a destructive
rampage. He then picks up the letter from the floor, not knowing that
it had been nearly hidden. Since it had been opened, he assumes that
she had read it and spurned him.While still in my bed, my thoughts turn to you, my immortal beloved
... I can live only completely with you, or not at all ... You're my
life, my everything ... Go on loving me. Ever yours, ever mine,
forever.In the final scene, Johanna visits Beethoven's grave, and the music turns
from the pathos of the 2nd movement to the triumph of the 3rd."

As the two search for one another, they learn what it takes to make a vow of love that can last for eternity.—Max Vaughn In Medieval Europe, a king named William rules a large and mighty kingdom. But he is sad until his daughter is born. He names her Odette. At the ceremony for his daughter, everyone was invited to the christening, including the queen of another kingdom, Queen Uberta, and her young son, Prince Derek. William and Uberta agree to unite their kingdoms through their children with the plan that they would spend every summer together with the hope of them falling in love and marrying. Unknown to both, is a big threat to their kingdoms. Sir Rothbart, an evil court warlock, looks on and is unconcerned about the birth of the new princess. He plans to overtake William's kingdom by means of the Forbidden Arts. But before he can have the chance to strike, William's guards attack and Rothbart's powers are plunged into darkness. Despite the calls for Rothbart's death, the king decides to banish him. Before he leaves, an enraged Rothbart swears he will return one day with his powers and take everything the king loves.Many fear that William is too kind. But over time, the threat is forgotten. The hopes turn instead to the following summer when Prince Derek and Princess Odette would meet. King William brings Odette to Queen Uberta's castle where she spends the summer with Derek. The two children, knowing they are meant to one day wed, instantly harbor a dislike for each other. Each summer, they resent their time together with Derek and his chap Bromley opting to prank Odette. When they both finally grow up to be young adults and meet again, Derek is struck by the discovery that Odette has grown from an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan. Odette also realizes she is now charmed by the prince, and they are smitten with each other. Following a kiss at the ball that night, Derek announces for them to arrange the marriage with cheers from his mother, but Odette asks him to wait. When Derek tells her she is all he ever wanted because she is beautiful, she asks him ""what else?"" and wants to know if beauty is all that matters to him. Confused, Derek asks her, ""What else is there?"" Saddened by his response, Odette rejects the marriage and departs with her disappointed father. Derek watches Odette, William, and their carriage leave, and Uberta exclaims about all the wasted years of planning. That night, her head butler, Lord Rogers, advises Derek that he must think of something other than Odette's beauty while Bromley is playing a little game of chess.On the road back to their kingdom, they're ambushed by Rothbart, who has gotten his powers back. Turning himself into the Great Animal, he attacks the king's fleet and kidnaps Odette. The wounded captain makes his way to Derek's castle, informing the prince, his friend, and the head butler of the attack. Upon learning from William's captain of the attack by the Great Animal, Derek races off to find the overturned carriage and mortally wounded king. With his last breaths, William tells Derek that Odette is gone after a great animal attacked them -- that it's ""not what it seems."" Once William dies, Derek cries out for the loss of Odette, not knowing if she's alive or dead.Following William's own assassination, Odette is shown to be a swan at the lake by the abandoned castle that is revealed to be Rothbart's new hideaway. He informs her that when the moonlight touches the lake each night, she will turn back into a princess. He also reveals that he still wishes to rule over William's kingdom, but he wants to do it legally as her husband, so he doesn't have to fight to keep the kingdom. Odette refuses him and tries to escape, but the court warlock further reveals that no matter where she is, she will turn back into a swan once the moon leaves the lake, leaving her to sob.After searching everywhere with no sign of Odette, Derek's kingdom believes she has perished, but Derek is determined to believe that the ""Great Animal"" has her and won't give her up without a fight. The next day, he practices daily to make sure he is ready for the battle. Lord Rogers helps Derek and Bromley practice by pulling together the musicians and has them dress up as forest animals, telling them that the servants have a day off. Derek and Bromley are armed with arrows that have harmless, painted balls of cloth instead of tips on them. They use the fake animals for target practice, keeping score of whose color is painted the most on each animal. Derek wins with a hidden spot on the elusive ""white rabbit"". Rogers then challenges Derek and Bromley to a quick round of ""Catch and Fire"" to prove that Bromley is as courageous as he claims. Dressed in a suit of armor with an apple tied on top of his helmet, Bromley shoots a single arrow at Derek who stands at a distance away with his back turned. Timing it perfectly, Derek whips around, snatches the arrow from the air and perfectly shots the apple in half, demonstrating his perfect ability as an archer. As Rogers tells Bromley about what it's like to have courage, Derek vows to find Odette no matter where she is.Back at Swan Lake, Odette has made friends with a French frog named Jean-Bob and a tortoise named Speed. Jean-Bob believes he is a prince and that a kiss from a princess will turn him back into his human, prince form. He thinks he needs to cross an alligator-filled moat to retrieve flowers for Odette, and the brave feat will make her want to kiss him. He fails to do so after almost getting eaten, and Odette tells him he deserves a kiss for trying. He agrees, but she explains that because of her spell, she can only kiss the man she loves. The man must then declare a vow of everlasting love to the world and her spell will be broken. She believes Derek is out there working on finding his way to her. Suddenly, an injured Irish puffin bird flies through the trees and collapses. Odette pulls the arrow from his wing and the bird wakes up, believing Odette to be the one who harmed him until he realizes she saved him. He feels indebted to her, introducing himself as Lieutenant Puffin. Odette explains there isn't much he can do because she is under a spell. Just then, Rothbart appears, asking for her hand in marriage again. Odette turns him down, exclaiming that he asks her the same question every night and she gives him the same answer -- ""I'll die first."" The moon sets, however, and Odette turns back into a swan.Back at the kingdom, Uberta is planning a ball for the following night where princesses from across the mainlands will meet the eligible prince, hoping one of them will sway Derek away from his quest to find Odette, despite Rogers doubting that Derek won't stop unless he finds Odette. Meanwhile, Derek continues to research through books at the library, looking for answers to King William's warning about the Great Animal not being what it seems. He finds a book that helps him deduce that the Great Animal is very likely to be a shapeshifter. He recruits Bromley to join him on a hunt in the woods after promising his mother he would be back in time for her ball, while she orders her first footman, Sir Chamberlain, to help make make the arrangements for the ball and required four royal escorts to escort the Ladies and Lords.Back at Swan Lake, Odette tells Puffin about her spell, and she and Puffin decide to retrieve the map from Rothbart's castle in order to find Derek and bring him back to the lake. After some trouble getting the map from Rothbart's hag sidekick, Bridget, Odette and Puffin are able to set out to Derek's castle. Along the way, they happen upon Derek and Bromley venturing through the woods. When Derek spots the swan, he believes it may be the Great Animal and attempts to shoot her with an arrow. Puffin pushes her away in time and they fly towards Swan Lake with Derek in pursuit. Odette is able to land on the lake and she transforms back into herself as Derek watches. Surprised but relieved to see her, he runs out to greet her in a loving reunion. Odette tells him about Rothbart and her spell, and Derek invites her to the ball the following night so he can declare his vow of everlasting love to the crowd and break her spell. At this moment, Rothbart starts calling out for Odette, who forces Derek to depart before he discovers them. Unknown to Odette, Rothbart heard their entire exchange and tells her she won't make it to the ball because there will be ""no moon"" that night, to her dismay and sorrow.Fearful that despite her not being there, Derek will still make his vow, Rothbart turns Bridget into Odette and sends her to the ball, plotting that Derek will make his vow to the wrong woman and the real Odette will die as a result. On the night of the ball, he imprisons Odette (who is now in her swan form) in the castle dungeon, along with Bromley, whom he found lost in the woods. Bridget (as Odette) arrives at the ball late and Derek immediately dances with her, happy to see Odette, but unaware it's not her.At Swan Lake, Puffin, Speed and Jean-Bob successfully free Odette from the dungeon, and Odette flies off towards Derek's castle. Through the window, she is shocked to see her doppelganger and desperately tries to break inside, but it's too late. Derek makes his vow to the wrong Odette, and the real one immediately feels the consequences. Rothbart breaks into the castle, crashing Uberta's party. He confronts Derek and reveals that he made his vow to the wrong woman, which is revealed to be Bridget. Derek spots Odette through the window as she weakly flies away. Realizing his mistake, he pursues Odette back to Swan Lake where he finds her transformed as a human again on the ground. Held by Derek, Odette tells him she is weak but knows the vow he made was meant for her. She confesses her love to him before losing consciousness. A furious Derek confronts Rothbart, demanding he shouldn't let her die. Rothbart challenges him to defeat him first, transforming and revealing himself into the Great Animal once more and the perilous battle ensues when Rothbart overpowers Derek and threw him on the ground, nearly killing him. Fortunately, Odette's animal friends are able to retrieve his bow from the lake and get it to him just in time. Bromley, who escaped from his earlier imprisonment in the dungeon, shoots a single arrow to Derek, who catches it in the air and fires it into the Great Animal's chest, sending him crashing to the lake in flash of magic lights. Once Rothbart is killed, Derek returns to Odette's side. Heartbroken, he declares his love to Odette, who wakes up. Happily, they embrace.Derek and Odette get married and unite their kingdoms with the young couple having restored Rothbart's castle and taken residence there. Bridget also redeems herself and falls in love with Sir Chamberlain. At the celebratory ball that night, Odette finally kisses Jean-Bob, and he believes he has turned into a prince when he sees a prince in the fountain water's reflection (when it's actually a real prince hovering over him). Derek pulls his bride onto a bridge overlooking Swan Lake. Odette asks him if he will love her until the day she dies, and Derek responds that he'll love her for much longer. They kiss."

In the Mouth of Madness,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113409/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An insurance investigator begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational. With the disappearance of hack horror writer Sutter Cane, all Hell is breaking loose...literally! Author Cane, it seems, has a knack for description that really brings his evil creepy-crawlies to life. Insurance investigator John Trent is sent to investigate Cane's mysterious vanishing act and ends up in the sleepy little East Coast town of Hobb's End. The fact that this town exists as a figment of Cane's twisted imagination is only the beginning of Trent's problems.—Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> The efficient and skeptical freelance insurance investigator John Trent is hired by the publisher Jackson Harglow to find where the famous writer Sutter Cane might be. After writing a series of best-sellers in the horror genre, affecting the reason and causing disorientation, memory loss, and paranoia in readers, Sutter has simply vanished near the release of his new novel, ""Horror in Hobb's End."" There is mass hysteria of his anxious fans waiting for the new release, and John believes that his disappearance is a marketing strategy. John follows his instincts and travels with Cane's editor, Linda Styles, to New Hampshire, seeking for the apparently fictional town of Hobb's End. While driving along in the night, Linda reaches Hobb's End, and John discloses that Sutter Cane has unleashed a powerful evil force in the black church of the mysterious town, and his twisted imagination is changing the reality and perception of those who read his novels.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Private investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) investigates a claim made by Arcane Publishing director Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston) of the alleged disappearance of popular horror novelist Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), who vanished days before his latest book was released. Harglow requests Trent recover the unfinished final story of Cane's popular series and assigns editor Linda Styles (Julie Carmen) to accompany him. After reading a few of the novels for research, Trent experiences vivid nightmares of monsters and deformed people murdering each other with axes. Linda explains the stories are known to cause disorientation, memory loss, and paranoia in ""less stable readers."" Trent notices a series of red lines on the book covers that, when aligned properly, form the outline of New Hampshire and mark a location alluded to be Hobb's End, the fictional setting for many of Cane's works.As they set out to find the town, Linda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late-night drive; a boy riding a bicycle whose visage changes as she somehow passes him three times; the yellow road lines vanish followed by the road itself disappearing; and the car seemingly driving over thunderhead storm clouds. They enter a rustic covered bridge in darkness and inexplicably arrive in daylight hours in Hobb's End on the other side.Trent and Linda search the small town and begin encountering fictional people and landmarks described in Cane's novels. They are checked into a hotel by Mrs. Pickman (Frances Bay), later revealed to have been torturing and eventually killing her husband. At The Black Church, described in Cane's books as the fount of evil that is polluting the entire town, Trent and Linda watch as a group of townspeople arrive wielding shotguns and torches, demanding Cane return a missing child. Johnny, the son of one of men of the group, suddenly appears in the doorway to the Church, supplanted by Cane himself. The townspeople are then set upon by attack dogs and driven off.Believing the events to be staged, Trent prepares to go back to Arcane, but is prevented when Linda steals the car keys. She heads to the Black Church to confront Cane, and is exposed to his final novel, In The Mouth Of Madness which drives her insane. Trent is approached at a bar by Johnny's father warning him to leave before the evil infects him as it has the inhabitants of Hobb's End. Trent later returns to the bar and witnesses the man commit suicide with a shotgun as he proclaims to merely be ""a character written to do it.""Outside the bar, a mob of mutated, monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon him with shotguns and torches. He flees to the hotel and discovers Mrs. Pickman and Linda have also been altered into mutated versions of their former selves. Trent then attempts to drive away from Hobb's End but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town, subsequently crashing while swerving to avoid hitting Linda. He awakens in a Catholic confessional where Cane explains the popularity of his stories will soon free an ancient race of monstrous beings that will reclaim the Earth. Cane brings Trent to his writing studio and tells him he is an invented character in one of the stories, and has no choice but to return the In The Mouth Of Madness manuscript to Arcane and begin the destruction of humanity.After giving Trent the manuscript, Cane tears open his face like a piece of paper, ripping a hole that leads into darkness. Trent flees through a long tunnel as the group of monsters chase him and suddenly finds himself laying on a country road, apparently back in reality. As he returns to New York, he repeatedly receives and burns new copies of the manuscript.Back at Arcane Publishing, Trent meets with Harglow who informs him Linda never existed; he was sent alone to find Cane. Furthermore, he had delivered the manuscript months ago and the book has been on sale for weeks with a movie adaptation set to release soon. Trent suffers a psychotic break and is arrested after he murders several people with an axe. Dr. Wrenn (David Warner) visits him in the psychiatric hospital and, after listening to Trent recount his story, dismisses him as insane and leaves. Trent wakes the following day to find his cell door torn from its hinges and the residents of the hospital slaughtered. He departs, hearing over an ambulance radio that the world has been overrun with mutant creatures and outbreaks of suicide and psychotic mass murders. Trent goes to see the In the Mouth of Madness metafilm, laughing hysterically as he watches his own experiences. As it ""catches up"" to his current situation, his laughter becomes insanity-laced sobs of despair, finally realizing that he is just a work of fiction."

Fresh's friends notice the two and embarrassed, Fresh leaves the group and talks to her at a distance through a fence in the school yard so they won't tease him.After school, Fresh goes to a forested, abandoned area to put his new earnings in a secret hiding place, where we see that he has amassed a substantial savings. From there, he goes to his grandmother's house where all of his aunt and cousins reside. Fresh greets everyone but no one pays him any attention.

After winning, Fresh plays his father but he loses. Sam criticizes Fresh's strategy and Fresh leaves to visit Chuckie, who proposes to enter their dog, Roscoe, in a dogfight to earn money. Fresh refuses so Chuckie urges Fresh to get him a job with Esteban. Fresh rebuffs his suggestion, saying that Chuckie is too immature to be a drug dealer, and agrees to enter their pet into the fight. Fresh leaves him to visit Esteban, who is annoyed that Fresh is selling crack for other drug dealers. He warns Fresh that when it comes to crack dealing, Fresh will either die addicted to his own product or be killed by rival dealers or unstable drug addicts. Then Esteban begins asking about Nichole, making it known that he would like to have sex with her. Fresh is shocked and struggles to hide his emotions. Esteban presses him for information about Nichole and Fresh dodges the questions by claiming that Nichole is watched carefully by his aunt.He leaves Esteban to go to the corner store where Nichole works. He bumps into James, Nichole's drug dealing boyfriend, who insults his appearance before allowing him to see Nichole. Fresh warns Nichole that Esteban is interested in her and asks her why she stays with James. She tells him that she doesn't love James; only the drugs he can supply her with. Fresh insists that he and their family loves her but Nichole dismisses him.Fresh goes to watch a neighborhood basketball game, where Jake begins to show jealously towards a small kid, Curtis, and pushes him to the ground during the game.

Esteban agrees and tells Fresh that he plans to groom Fresh to his protege and wants Fresh to stop selling for other dealers.Meanwhile, Corky has the police hot on his trail since Jake's shooting attracted attention. It is a this point that Fresh devises an elaborate strategy that will ultimately remove himself and his sister from the projects. Fresh goes to another source, Hector, under the pretense of being the runner for Corky. Hector refuses to hand over the drugs to Fresh, fearing that the police will come after him. Fresh threatens him and offers him a substantial sum of cash, which we understand to be the entirety of Fresh's personal savings. Hector takes the money and tells Fresh where to pick up the drugs. Fresh says that the police have wire-tapped Corky's phone numbers and tells Hector not to call Corky.At school, Chuckie can't resist bragging about his new job for Esteban. After school, he and Fresh buy science textbooks to hide bags of heroin in before going on the subway, where Chuckie mouths off to a police officer.

When leaving the building, three men step out from behind the corner approaching them. Chuckie tries to shoot at the men but trips. The gun falls under a car and Chuckie tries to grab it but an assailant shoots the tire and it flattens under Chuckie's hand, crushing it. Fresh runs back over to help him, but Chuckie is stuck. Fresh runs away and the assailants shoot Chuckie. Fresh is questioned by the police at the police station. They question him, but since they have no evidence to detain him, they let him go.

Perez, gives him his card.Back at home, Fresh's aunt remonstrates sadly with him for getting involved in gunfire and tells him that she cannot risk the lives of her eleven other children for him. She informs him that he will be sent to a group home for a month. At school, Fresh's friends blame him for Chuckie's death and truly alone, Fresh shoots Chuckie's dog, Roscoe. When Fresh goes outside, Jake forces him in the car with the three assailants, revealing that Jake had ordered the attack. They bring Fresh to a room where Corky is waiting. Jake brags that he told Corky that Fresh was selling for other rival dealers but Fresh lies to the other henchmen that Fresh was being forced to sell for Jake. The henchmen turn on Jake and Jake's friend Red tries to convince them that Fresh is lying. However, Fresh insists that Jake and Red were planning to oust Corky and he was only saying that he was selling for Esteban as protection. Fresh tells them to call Hector, who will reveal the truth.Corky calls Hector, where Hector confirms that he met with Fresh. The conversation is short, with Hector expressing concern over Corky' phone being wire-tapped, as Hector was told was the case, by Fresh. An enraged Corky hangs up, assuming that Jake is behind it all. Corky believes the version of events stated by Fresh and whips Red and Jake to death with chains. Corky turns to Fresh and asks who else is involved. Fresh names James.Fresh then goes to Esteban's warehouse and tells him that Corky's crew had jumped him and says that Corky is planning to sell heroin as well. He tells Esteban that Corky's distributor is James and the two are planning to meet that night. He also adds that Nichole is seeing James secretly because James is plotting with Corky to take Esteban out. Corky and his men arrive at James' place and storm in while Esteban, Fresh, and two other men wait in Esteban's car, watching them. Esteban signals his henchmen to follow him and tells Fresh and Herbie to stay put.Inside, Esteban's crew kills James, Corky, and Corky's men. Afterwards, they drive to Esteban's place and Esteban sees Nichole is there. He tells his henchmen to take Fresh home but Fresh makes them stop the car, claiming that he will spend the night at a friend's house. He runs into a convenience store and makes a phone call on a pay phone.He then shows up at Esteban's apartment, claiming that he couldn't go home. Esteban lets him stay because he wants to confront Fresh for telling Nichole that he found her father in Staten Island and for urging her to leave for a rehabilitation center. Angry, Esteban demands to know what else Fresh is hiding from him. The three argue and Esteban tries to force Nichole to stay with him.The police arrive and as Esteban goes to answer the door, Fresh hides something under the bed. The police officer turns out to be Sgt. Perez, who reveals that he is responding to a call about a domestic dispute. Esteban denies any argument and suggests they have the wrong apartment. Fresh comes forward and tells Perez that his sister is scared to speak up and how Esteban is a drug dealer who killed James and is now threatening his sister. Esteban swears that he is clean but Fresh tells Sgt. Perez to check under the bed. The policeman looks under the bed and find Esteban's gun (which he removed from the car after the shooting earlier) and the drugs Fresh planted. The police take Esteban away and Sgt. Perez promises to protect Fresh and his sister from any retaliation. Fresh expresses that he no longer wants to live in any ""projects"".Next, Fresh walks to the park to play chess with his father, who is angry that Fresh is late. He tells Fresh that he will not give him anymore chess tips as he won't always be there to hold his hand. After his ranting, he looks at Fresh, who is staring back at him, crying. His father, bashfully looks away, hesitant to make his first chess move. Fresh continues to stare at his father, expressionless, as tears run down his cheeks."

He orders the cashier to take the policemen's guns and put them in his back pockets. He orders the three people to lie face down on the ground while he leaves the shop, taking the woman with him. A gun slips out of Jack's pocket and goes off, blasting a hole in a drink machine. Jack orders the woman to take him to her red BMW, orders her into the car, gets in the car himself and drives off.

The shutter on the back opens. Dead bodies spill out onto the road. A body falls on the police car's windscreen. The police officer yells to the other to get that dead body off. It scares them and it stinks. Jack says they're going to be travelling for a while so he thinks they should get better acquainted. He says there are no rules on how to kidnap people. There's no rule saying you can't be cordial and nice. The woman says her name is Natalie Voss.Jack says he didn't intend to kidnap anyone, he didn't plan anything. Dalton Voss has entered the police station. The police look at the footage from the camera in the shop. They get a good look at the man's face.

The gun just went off. He didn't mean to shoot him. Natalie says: ""Well what were you gonna do, squirt water at him?""Jack says he hates violence.

That's all your daughter's worth to you? You're a billionaire, that's pathetic.""Dalton offers a hundred thousand dollars. ""What the hell do you want? An airplane?""Jack does not want Dalton's money or his planes. Natalie says that her stepmother is not her mother. Dalton does not want Natalie to bring this up. ""Don't you smart mouth me young lady. I've tried to give you everything you want.""Jack says ""Your daughter is going through a crisis right now and does not need to be berated like this.

Jack ends the phone call. He says that Dalton is a dickhead. More police cars and two police motorcycles have joined the chase. Jack says that everybody wants something from Dalton, including Natalie. She wants respect, to be treated like a human being, like a woman, not like some little baby girl which is obviously how Dalton still sees her. Natalie says that her stepmother married Dalton for his money, but Dalton is too stupid to notice. The stepmother tries to control everything and everybody. Jack asks about Natalie's real mother. Natalie's real mother would rather be her best friend than her mother. Ari Josephson, Jack's attorney wants to talk to Jack. He says Jack will listen to him. The car phone rings.

Ari says ""Why don't you just let the girl out? Nobody's gonna hurt you if you just give yourself up. Come back, we'll talk, we'll figure something else out. Maybe we can get the public behind you. Public outcry against the justice is a very powerful tool.""Jack says the public would recognize him as the red nose robber who has kidnapped the richest girl in the country. Ari says ""Mexico isn't the answer. You're innocent, we'll get a retrial. You'll eventually get out, so just stop the damn car and give yourself up before it's too late.""Jack just wants to say thanks for everything. Ari believed in him. Ari still believes in Jack. He's still working hard. They can beat this thing together. Ari can get Jack out. Jack says he's already out. He ends the phone call.The car phone rings. A reporter on channel nine hardcore news live asks Jack a question which is on the minds of all the viewers. What does Jack intend to do when the car runs out of gas? Jack responds ""That's the question that's on the minds of all your viewers? Whether I run out of gas or not? You let your viewers know that I hope Miss Voss's fear and my desperation are entertainment enough for them. After all that's what this is all about right? What makes for good television? The story. As it breaks. Live. Coming to you from the bad guy himself? I mean we wouldn't want your viewers to change the fucking channel, would we?"" He rips the car phone off the car so he can't receive any more incoming calls.People are setting up a hopefully impenetrable barrier on the border into Mexico, with police cars and plows. Jack says a guy dressed as a clown robbed a bank. The same jerk had knocked off several banks in a clown outfit. The media and all their originality picked up on this and labeled him the red nose robber. The police arrested Jack. The only job Jack could get was playing a clown at children's birthday parties. One of the neighbors saw the story on the news and called the police. The police got a search warrant. They crashed down the door and found Jack's costume. It was all over. Two men in a green monster truck quickly swerve the truck across the road in an attempt to crash the BMW. The swerving truck crashes onto its side. Some police cars swerve and crash as a result. Jack comes to traffic at a standstill. A lorry crashes into the green truck and pushes it further along the road. The lorry's trailer turns onto its side. Jack drives backwards up the road and then drives forwards on the wrong side of the road to get past the traffic. The two men flee from the green truck and the truck explodes.A reporter asks Ari if Jack is innocent, why was he found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by a jury? Ari says ""The actual thief cut his hand on the teller's paper spinner. A sample of that dried blood was taken and tested and compared with a sample of my client's blood. Jack's blood is type B positive. The red nose robber's blood is type A. But because the evidence was collected improperly from a crime scene, it was deemed inadmissible in court.""Jack is twenty-eight years old. He has a lot of good years ahead of him. He's not going to waste them away in a prison. The system has rules, presidents and procedures and legal loopholes, all this crap that's more important than a human being. Jack was sentenced yesterday. This is why he ran. This is why he stole the car. And this is why he freaked out when he saw the police and kidnapped Natalie. The police officer recording the event has to change microphones. He has to fix the mic. He gets over the seat and obstructs the driver's vision, causing the police car to swerve. The three police officers get him back into the back seat. A news reporting van drives alongside the BMW. The reporter shouts if Natalie can give them a thumbs up if she's okay. Jack holds his middle finger up at the window. The driver swerves the van to avoid crashing into a blue car on the road. The cameraman drops the camera which smashes to pieces on the road. A TV host apologizes to the viewers for that obscene gesture they just saw. Jack reveals the gun was a candy bar. He kidnapped Natalie with a candy bar.Dalton wants to be taken to the barricade on the Mexican border. A reporter is talking with the drivers of the green monster truck. She asks what possessed them to take such radical and desperate measures to stop the BMW themselves. One of the men replies: ""We're just doing our duty as Americans.""The other man says: ""It's not the first time we had to take matters into our own hands. Mark my words, they'll be pullin' over soon.""The men said they really scared them, and they'll be happy to tell anyone about it. The men are put inside a police car. Natalie is falling in love with Jack. They're all cuddling and kissing. The sky has got dark. Lots of police cars are in pursuit. Natalie says she is Jack's insurance policy. ""As long as I'm your hostage, they can't get to you. You can demand a ransom from my father, we'll take the money, we'll escape to Mexico.""Jack says ""Maybe Mexico ain't such a hot idea. We'll have to wait in line at the border while they check the trunk for legal fruit.""Natalie says she is Jack's hostage. There's no way the police can think they're in this together. Jack notices there are no more cars on the road. They see and approach the barricade. ""Do something!"" cries Natalie.""Like what?"" says Jack. Jack drives backwards up the road. He speeds through the gap of two police cars. He swerves the car round and drives forwards. Police cars swerve to the left and the right. A police car crashes into another police car. Jack swerves the car round again and drives forwards. Another police car crashes. There's an explosion. The police car is thrown through the air and flips over on the road. Jack crashes through a wooden ""El Jibarito"" advertising board and takes the car off road. The police cars chase after. Jack leads the line of pursuing vehicles in a circle. Jack parks the car. He tells Natalie ""It's over. I can't let you ruin your life because of me. I think it's time for you to go home now. Now I'm a car thief and a kidnapper, cop shooter, police evader. I can't do this to you. I can't make you part of this anymore. Besides I can't hold you hostage anymore. You ate the gun.""Natalie says Jack has the real gun. Jack puts the policeman's gun in Natalie's bag. Natalie says Jack is innocent. Jack thanks Natalie for believing in him. Natalie gets out the car. There are flashback scenes of what has happened in the movie. Jack gets out of the car and throws a cigarette to the ground. He holds out his finger from behind his back and the police shoot at him. Jack wakes up. This part of the movie was a dream. He gets out of the car for real this time with his hands in the air. He turns around and puts his hands on his head. The police surround Jack and put handcuffs on him. Dalton Voss arrives in a helicopter. He smacks Jack across his face despite his apology. Natalie tells her father that Jack is innocent.""Later,"" Dalton says. Natalie fires the gun up in the air to get everyone's attention. She holds the gun to a police officer's head. She threatens to blow his brains out over live TV. She shoots at the helicopter which explodes to show she means business. In this movie, people do as they are told when someone's life is at risk. Jack's handcuffs are removed. Everyone steps away from Jack. Natalie orders the cameraman out of the news reporting helicopter. Ari is laughing at what he's seeing on the TV. Jack and Natalie get inside the helicopter. Natalie orders the pilot at gunpoint to fly off. Jack and Natalie are enjoying themselves on a beach in Mexico.There is a scene shown after the credits. A person dressed as a clown is driving a car. He says ""You smell that? Nothing else in the world smells like that son. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one day we had a hell bomb. And when I walked out, we didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. But that smell, that gasoline smell, the whole hill, it smelt like victory."""

As an adult, his inhibitions about this desire have resulted in an equally unsuccessful love life. After he's stood up by his bride on their wedding day, he seeks to break this pattern by visiting ""the island"" owned by his friend Martin.Elliot says if he's chosen for the island, he can make the trip after completing a one-month work assignment in South America. When he arrives back in Los Angeles on a pre-dawn flight, he phones Martin from the airport and is told he's been chosen. At baggage claim he witnesses a diamond smuggling operation involving a female (faux) flight attendant and a male (faux) baggage handler. He also snaps photos of both of them.During the operation, an airport security officer talks to the attendant and Elliot. After the attendant leaves, Elliot casually tells the officer he may have witnessed a smuggling of some sort. He gives his business card in case the airport police want prints of his photos later.The smugglers deliver the diamonds to a strip club, meeting their buyer's henchman in a back hallway.

At the police station, flight attendant Susan from Elliot's flight identifies a woman in a mug shot as the faux flight attendant. Before her encounter with Elliot, the faux attendant had attacked Susan in an airport restroom after Susan recognized her as a (disguised) male passenger on the plane. The airport security officer also identifies the woman.The buyer admits he bought the diamonds from Omar, an international jewel smuggler wanted by Interpol for murder as well as smuggling. The female smuggler is his partner Nina Blackstone, a hired henchwoman with violent tendencies. Over a 30-year career, Omar had scrupulously avoided being photographed -- until now. Fred suggests that Nina likely told Omar about Elliot's photo of him. If they can get to Elliot first, they can set a trap and nail Omar when he tries to recover the photo. Sheila and their superior, Lieutenant Malone, agree to Fred's proposal.Malone has learned that Elliot's ship is bound for Eden, a BDSM island resort off the coast of Mexico owned by Dr. Martin Halifax. He arranges for Sheila and Fred to travel there undercover, and for Fred to meet with Halifax before their departure.Elliot has the film roll containing Omar's photo in his camera bag aboard the ship. As the ship nears Eden, senior trainer Richard welcomes the travelers and explains the rules. They have been carefully selected to be submissives, or ""citizens"" in Eden parlance. During their one-week stay, their luggage will be stored for safekeeping and they must obey every command they're given. Reba, a repeat citizen, is clearly hot for Richard.Omar and Nina have also learned Elliot's destination. They call in a favor from Nina's contact Priscilla, a dominatrix who gets several client referrals from Halifax. Omar threatens Priscilla at gunpoint to get him and Nina on the next guest list to Eden.At Eden the new citizens are introduced to the guests/dominants in a lavish ceremony presided over by Mistress Lisa, the Headmistress of Eden. An initially hesitant Elliot suddenly throws off his inhibitions and makes a great first impression on the guests, but not on Mistress Lisa. To teach him humility, she assigns him to perform chores on work detail.Citizens travel to Eden by boat, and guests by chartered plane. Sheila and Fred arrive on the latest flight, she as guest Lucy Smith and he as a newly hired maintenance worker. Omar and Nina are also on the flight as Mr. Tillington and Ms. Randi. Each guest is assigned a personal citizen as they disembark. Sheila is paired with Tommy, and Omar with Kitty.Later that first day, Sheila looks for Omar while Omar looks for Elliot. Fred concludes that Ms. Randi is Nina and watches her in hopes she'll lead them to Omar. By day's end they've all come up empty because Elliot, being on work detail, is out of the guests' sights and away from the regular citizens.Mistress Lisa and her personal citizen Diana review the profiles of the new citizens. Lisa decides to work with Elliot herself, and gets him to acknowledge his spanking desire. They spend some more time together, and to her surprise she is attracted to him.The next day is Sports Day on the island, for which the citizens on work detail are released from duty to participate too. To find Elliot, Sheila requests him and he's brought to her room. When she just wants to talk, he gets antsy because he wants to enter the rollerblade race which is about to start. The winner will receive a private meeting with Mistress Lisa. Elliot admits he's spent some time with Lisa and is attracted to her, but hasn't told her because she keeps him at a distance. Sheila then says she's heard he's a photographer and asks if he can take some photos for her. He answers he can't because his camera's in storage and he doesn't know where it is. Nor has another guest requested him so far.Elliot finally has to leave to make the race. Mistress Lisa arrives right after it starts, and watches him skate to victory. Omar tries to trap him by asking him to do a private performance with Kitty. Lisa witnesses the request and intervenes, politely lying to Omar that Eden doesn't allow voyeurism. Richard, who's also present, disapprovingly realizes that Lisa has fallen for Elliot and decides to assign him to a harsher guest.Sheila requests Elliot a second time, but is told she'll have to wait because he's currently assigned to Ms. Randi/Nina. Sheila goes to Nina's room and extracts him from Nina's deadly clutches. Omar had been hiding in the room, and he tells Nina to stay put while he follows Sheila. Her voice sounds familiar to him.Sheila starts to tell Elliot the truth, but is interrupted again when Diana appears and returns him to work detail on Mistress Lisa's orders. Sheila then asks Tommy how she can find out where Elliot is. After she clarifies she just needs to talk to Elliot, Tommy happily goes off to fetch him.Deciding that falling for Elliot was a big mistake, Mistress Lisa has his luggage brought from storage to her room. As she goes through his things, the film canister containing Omar's photo slips out of his camera bag unnoticed. When Elliot arrives thinking he's meeting with Lisa after the rollerblade race, she instead apologizes for crossing the line from professional into personal. She hands him a refund check and orders him to leave Eden, saying Diana will ensure he gets home. Elliot refuses to give up on their attraction, and convinces Lisa to continue exploring it. Diana had told Elliot that Lisa loves the Deep South, and he suggests a spontaneous weekend trip to New Orleans.Tommy, who delivered Elliot's luggage to Mistress Lisa, tells Sheila about it and that it means Elliot's leaving Eden. He then starts going all-out to pleasure Sheila, who stops him and orders him to stay in her room while she goes to see Lisa.While giving Omar a massage, Kitty makes a chance remark which jogs his memory and he remembers Sheila from the strip club. He and Nina go to Sheila's room and learn from Tommy that Sheila went to see Mistress Lisa. Nina leaves to eliminate Sheila, while Omar goes after Elliot.Citizen Reba tells Richard that she saw Elliot and Lisa leave Eden, and heard them talk about New Orleans. Omar overhears that conversation and calls a contact in The Big Easy.In the office, Sheila tells Diana she's a cop and that Lisa could be in danger. While Diana goes to fetch Fred, Sheila starts searching for Omar in the guest records. Nina appears and attacks Sheila. Fred arrives and he and Sheila subdue Nina, who refuses to admit knowing Omar. They turn Nina over to the San Diego police, track Elliot and Lisa to New Orleans and head there themselves.Elliot and Lisa are out and about enjoying the city, blissfully unaware they're being followed by Omar's contact and then Omar himself. They visit a historic mansion and slip away from the tour group to have fun in an off-limits upstairs bedroom. Omar finds them there and pulls a gun, and Elliot recognizes him from the Los Angeles airport. When Omar demands Elliot's camera and film, Elliot seemingly complies and then suddenly tackles him.Sheila and Fred also track Elliot and Lisa to the mansion, and arrive to see Omar hurl Lisa through a door onto the bedroom balcony. Fred races into the mansion while Sheila clambers up the wisteria trellis. At the top she shoots and wounds Omar, but he's still able to attack her and disable her gun hand. As she clings desperately to the trellis with her other hand, Fred charges through the bedroom door and shoots Omar. The second shot sends Omar tumbling over the balcony rail to the lawn below.At the police station, Lisa sits in the waiting area while Elliot gives a statement to the New Orleans police. She sees a man imploring his battered sister to get away from her violent partner, and a wife who endures her husband's abuse because all their assets are in his name only. A deeply shaken Lisa tells Elliot she wants to wait at the hotel while he gives a second statement to Sheila and Fred. She leaves a farewell note in their room and returns to Eden. Elliot later tells Sheila that Lisa left.Sheila travels to Eden to pick up Omar's photo, which never left the island. She then urges Lisa not to give up on Elliot. Lisa is used to always being in control which ensures never becoming a victim, and says the women at the New Orleans police station became victims because they gave up control. Sheila replies that there are healthy relationships as well as bad ones, and while some men are creeps, Elliot is not. If they don't nurture the good ones, there won't be any.Lisa returns to her room and finds a surprise visitor: Elliot, who asks her to marry him. He assures her that their relationship will be whatever the two of them decide they want it to be. She accepts his proposal.Sheila checks in for the plane leaving Eden, and a man in a business suit sitting nearby sets aside his newspaper and greets her by her own name. It's Tommy. A surprised Sheila fumbles that he looks good in clothes, and she didn't recognize him without his thong and chains. Tommy is a corporate CEO who visits Eden a couple of times a year for fun and relaxation. One of his factories is in Los Angeles, and he asks Sheila if they can have dinner sometime. After a moment's hesitation, she answers yes.Tommy kisses Sheila goodbye, then has to run to catch the boat leaving Eden. As Sheila goes to board the plane, she whoops in excitement at her new relationship and says in voiceover: ""No matter what your sexual preference, love is the ultimate fantasy."""

She clearly expects results, offering bonuses and insulting the callers reminding one of them ""ask for the sale four times, every time. Got it?"" When one of the salesmen makes a sale she offers him either $100.00 or $1000.00 worth of rare commemorative coins. When he chooses the $100.00 she says ""Wise man.""Meanwhile, Bridget's husband, Clay Gregory (Bill Pullman), is meeting some drug dealers under a bridge with a case full of ""pharmaceutical cocaine."" He hands them is case, and tries to take the case of money from one of the money only to have a gun pulled on him. He lets go and starts sobbing ""one stupid mistake."" assuming he's either getting busted or robbed. It turns out it's neither, they just don't want to give up the case, and they dump the money out, leaving it on the ground for him.Bridget gets to her and Clay's apartment, finding a message from Clay that his meeting was moved back. She's excited when he comes home, asking if he got the money. Clay starts pulling the bills out of his shirt and Bridget remarks on his appearance, ""Do you walk the streets like that? You're an idiot!"" Clay responds by slapping her and then quickly apologizes, telling her he's on edge from dealing with ""scary people."" and offering to let her hit him anywhere, hard. He remarks ""this is what we worked for"" and reminds her that she's a ""criminal mastermind"" He also mentions that he'll pay off the loan shark tomorrow, to which Bridget says ""maybe he'll forget."" Clay goes off to the shower, yelling into the living room for Bridget's opinion on dinner plans. ""Whatever you want"" she says, as she writes a note, (backwards) takes the money and leaves. Clay realizes she's gone and finds the note which he reads in the mirror, says ""How are we supposed to celebrate?""
He calls out to her in the street ""You better run!""Bridget takes a cab to her own car, takes off her ring and drives out of the city, for Chicago, stopping in Beston when she gets low on gas. Before leaving she stops into a Beston bar, where Mike Swale (Peter Berg) is chatting with his friends about a recent trip he made to Buffalo, which didn't work out, landing him back in Beston. When a girl hits on Mike, he hushes his friends from ooohing about it saying ""These women are anchors. You get too close to one, Beston's got you for life."" This is clearly a regular thing for Mike as his friends react saying ""Here we go again."" One of Mike's friends says ""Tell me about the wife."" pointing out Mike's wedding band. Mike complains that he can't get it off. Mike starts complaining about being stuck in Beston again, and his friend asks when he'll leave. Mike answers ""How long's it take to grow a new set of balls?"" Mike then notices Bridget enter the bar. The bartender intentionally snubs her, asking if anyone in the bar needs a drink while she's asking for one. Mike tells his friend, ""This might be my new set of balls."" Mike orders her a drink which the bartender is happy to get now. Trying to make small talk, Mike says ""You're not from around here?"" and Bridget answers ""Fuck off."" before grabbing a table for herself. Mike approaches her table and is told to go away.
Mike: Well, I haven't finished charming you yet.
Bridget: You haven't started.
Mike: Give me a chance.
Bridget: Go find yourself a nice little cow girl, make nice little cow babies and leave me alone.
Mike: [leaning in] I'm hung like a horse. Think about it.
Bridget: Let's see
Mike: Excuse me?
Bridget: Mr Ed. Let's see.
Mike: Look, I tried to be nice. I can see that's something you're not...
Bridget: Now I'm trying. I can be very nice when I try. Sit down. Mike is shocked when she check's out his horse claim as soon as he sits down. saying ""I never buy anything sight unseen"" She then quizzes him about his past. Mike claims he's had twelve lovers, no prostitutes, and emphasizes that he's never slept with a man. She then asks about his place. Mike says he also has a name prompting Bridget to say ""No names. Meet me outside.""Mike wakes up looking for her, and finds Bridget talking on his phone and checking out his fridge. She calls her lawyer, Frank (J.T. Walsh) and explains her situation. Frank tells her her husband is entitled to half of anything bought with the cash, so to keep it in cash until a divorce can be finalized which he estimates could take two years. he also advises her to stay put as Clay will know to look for her in Chicago. She runs out without saying good bye to Mike, and he runs outside yelling after her. Bridget picks up a newspaper and finds a job opening in the classifieds for a Lead Generation Manager at Interstate Insurance Company. The employer is impressed with her resume, and she tells him a story about her husband beating her, which is forcing her to hide and use an assumed name. She choose the name Wendy Kroy. She runs into Mike in the hallway, who works at the same company. She tells him to act as if the sex never happened.Bridget rents a place and calls Frank again from her office. Frank tells her that Clay called talking about ""a loan shark and his thumb."" He adds ""Anyone check you for a heartbeat lately?"" He tells her that if she won't send Clay some cash to tell him to quit calling. She says she'll call Clay and Frank tells her to be careful as he might trace it. She responds ""He's not that clever."" She gives Clay a call and we see that Clay's thumb is bandaged. The operator asks if he'll take the call and Clay asks ""Is this Bridget in Chicago or Bridget in Dallas?"" Bridget tells the operator to disconnect. After work she goes to the bar again, where Mike immediately sees her. She takes him outside to have sex in a not very hidden spot behind the bar. Mike takes the opportunity to ask ""Where do I fit in?"" and isn't pleased when she says ""You're my designated fuck.""They meet for sex regularly and Mike keeps pushing for information which she doesn't give. He continues to complain about being ""kept at arm's length."" She continually makes light of his need for more than sex. Bridget calls Clay from the office again and asks him to get the number from a pay phone down the block and she'll call back. We see that Clay has a guy, Harlan (Bill Nunn) there to trace the call. Clay runs around the apartment to sound winded and when she calls back he gives her a number he already has. Clay runs in place again holding a cordless phone given to him by Harlan, while jumping rope in the apartment. When Bridget remarks it sounds quiet, he opens a window. He asks for the money back and Bridget says ""It's mine, you hit me."" Clay tells her the $100,000.00 he borrowed from the loan shark is now $150,000.00. She offers to pay off the loan shark and his private detective and leave him ten grand. The phone rings in the apartment tipping her off and she hangs up. The trace turns up the area code, giving them the city she's in. Frank advises her to stay put since she has an alias and it's not likely they'll find her.Bridget and Mike show up to work at the same time and Bridget explains that ""a woman loses 50% of her authority when people find out who she's sleeping with."" Mike protests, but when they get in the building she slaps Mike and acts as if he's groping her.Harlan and Clay discuss finding Bridget and Harlan explains he doesn't have enough information to do anything. Their talking is interrupted by a ""customer"" buying prescription drugs from Clay. Harlan tells Clay that she likely has an alias. Clay sees a ""New York"" poster in the mirror, and recalling Bridget's backard writing skill, tells Harlan that she's using ""Wendy Kroy"" because all she's thinking about is getting back to New York.Bridget approaches Mike at the bar five days after the office incident. Mike is still complaining about wanting more. Mike tells Bridget about his job as a claims adjuster, which she finds boring until he mentioned he talked with a woman whose husband died, and the woman remarked that she should have killed him years ago. Mike also explains that he knew the husband was cheating from his credit report, as he had credit cards for women other than his wife. Bridget convinces Mike that they should make a list of women with cheating husbands, who have big insurance policies. She then calls one of the numbers and sells the woman her husband's murder, before telling the woman it was a joke. She then tells Mike that she's using the activity to be more than sex partners when he doesn't want to play along. Mike does a call of his own and she lets him come back to her place for the first time. In bed, Bridget asks Mike to tell her about his wife. He asks ""How'd you know?"" and she says ""I didn't."" She prompts him to talk about her wife but he isn't forthcoming saying ""It was a mistake."" Mike implies that Bridget coming to town was significant and when pressed about it he says ""You've been out there. You came here, and you chose me. So I was right, I'm bigger than this town."" Bridget: So what's wrong?
Mike: You can't stop reminding me that you're bigger than me.Bridget gets to work the next day and hears in a hush hush tone from the receptionist that ""There was a black man here to see you."" She asks what he wanted and the receptionist says ""Wouldn't say. He was black though."" Bridget can't get ahold of Frank and later that night at Mike's place, she reveals that she's on the run. She tells him she ""made a sale."" referring to murdering cheating husbands. Mike isn't at all interested and turns her down going off to play hockey without her. She gets into her car to leave and Harlan gets into the car with her holding a gun on her. Bridget offers to share with him instead of Clay and banters with him about leaving her money. She teases him asking ""Is it true what they say about size?"" when she doesn't let up he unzips his pants. She speeds up while he does this and slams the car into a telephone pole counting on the drivers side airbag to protect her, although Harlan gets thrown through the windshield and killed. At the hospital she tells the police that Harlan had planned to rape her. Mike shows up at the hospital and asks how hockey was, playing up his guilt. She pushes him about the murder for hire again. He won't agree and she tells him she'll do it herself rather than stay there forever.Bridget calls Clay and he remarks that he heard about Clay. He tells her that he's hired a local PI to watch her, parked outside her house. He tells her that now that he knows where she is he's willing to hire a sociopath to take her out. Bridget offers to buy a week, paying the loan shark while she settles things. Clay asks ""What made you do this?""
Bridget: I don't know. You slapped me.
Clay: That's just an excuse
Bridget: You're probably right, but I get to slap you back.
Clay agrees to her proposition as long as the local PI keeps tailing her.Back at the office, she tries to make travel arrangements without giving her name. Mike listens outside the door and seems concerned that she's going away. She tells him she's just going to New York for the weekend. At her place, Bridget bakes cookies for the PI, dropping one and putting a board with nails under his tire when she picks it up. A cab pulls up and she asks to go to Buffalo. She visits city hall and gets the name of Mike's wife, Trish Swale. She then visits Mike's wife and heads home.Back at the bar, one of Mike's friends tells him that Bridget asked what Mike's secret was, and propositioned him. Mike hits his friend who then says that he came onto her and she shot him down. Mike is distraught and drunk, calls Bridget from a payphone while drinking from a paper bag, leaving her a confessional message about loving her and having a hard time trusting himself after Buffalo. Bridget listens to the message and scribbles a note with Mike's name in a heart. Mike drives over later to erase the message and finds the scribbling while Bridget watches from under the bed. She leaves a ticket for Mike to find coming in, that makes it appear that she went to Miami. Mike assumes she killed the guy she'd talked about. Mike pulls out the note, to prove that she loves him, but Bridget kicks him out. She can't help but laugh afterwards.Mike approaches her at the office, asking for details about the guy she killed, telling her that he's trying to accept what she's done. She tells him she's leaving without him and he asks what he can do to convince her to take him. She tells him that he needs to do what she did and that would make them equals. She presents him with information on a guy named Cahill. Mike refuses again. and as he leaves Bridget smiles and writes a letter claiming to be from his wife Trish, telling him she got a job at Interstate Insurance. We see Mike opening and reading the letter.Mike shows up at Bridget's place, exclaiming that he'll do it as long as they never come back to Beston. Bridget calls the police and claims the PI watching her exposed himself to local kids. While the police hassle the PI, Bridget and Mike take off. On the ride to New York, Bridget grills him about the details of the murder, which involve restraining and gagging Cahill and acting as if he's robbing the place and stabbing him to death. He asks why he has to shut the lights off afterwards and she tells him it's psychology, to tell himself he's finished an unpleasant chore.We see Mike find Cahill on the mailbox tag. He enters the apartment and we see that he's in Clay's apartment. Clay doesn't seem intimidated, and offers some wisecracks. He critiques Mike's methods telling him if he's gagged he can't tell him where everything is. Mike can't bring himself to stab Clay and he exclaims to himself ""I can't do it Wendy! I just cant!"" This prompts an outburst from the gagged Clay, which catches his interest. He lets Clay explain. He gives Mike the details and he tells Mike to find something else in the apartment that says Cahill. Clay explains that she is planning to finger him for the murder, and figures that the cops are already on the way. assuming he's to signal her somehow, which they realize is the reason that Mike is to shut the lights off. Bridget watches the window from the street and when the lights go off she heads up. Mike kicks a wedding picture across the floor to her and confronts her about her plan. Clay is still bound as Bridget has the handcuff keys. She sprays mace down his throat, killing him and tells Mike that now they have a future. She then suggests they ""roleplay"" although Mike is stunned at what just happened. She tells him ""You killed my husband and raped me!"" Mike pushes her away and holds the gun on her, telling her she's going to jail. He picks up the phone and Bridget tells him that Trish wasn't coming to Beston. We see in flashback that Trish is actually a man. Bridget taunts him about it, and he slaps her and dares him to rape her. Mike is over the edge now and gives in, not realizing that Bridget has dialed 911 while laying over the desk. Bridget makes sure to yell, ""You killed my husband!"" while he says ""You want to be raped! I'll rape you!"" the 911 operator of course hears everything.Mike is in prison talking to his lawyer, who tells him that the man Bridget claimed to kill is still alive and that the case against him is airtight and there's nothing he can do without one piece of evidence. He mentions that he's likely facing the death penalty. He tells the lawyer, ""There might be one thing."" We then see Bridget in a limo handling the tag that reads ""Cahill"" She burns it with her lighter as the limo drives her away."

Ed Wood,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109707/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ambitious but troubled movie directorEdward D. Wood Jr.tries his best to fulfill his dreams despite his lack of talent. Because of his eccentric habits and bafflingly strange films, directorEdward D. Wood Jr.is a Hollywood outcast. Nevertheless, with the help of the formerly famousBela Lugosiand a devoted cast and crew of show-business misfits who believe in Ed's off-kilter vision, the filmmaker is able to bring his oversize dreams to cinematic life. Despite a lack of critical or commercial success, Ed and his friends manage to create an oddly endearing series of extremely low-budget films.—Jwelch5742 The film opens with a thunderstorm. Lightning flashes illuminate a spooky old house, accompanied by the eerie wailing of a Theremin. The camera moves inside the house to reveal a coffin which opens and from the coffin Criswell sits up. (This is nearly identical to opening scene to Night of the Ghouls). Criswell offers an opening commentary which practically repeats the opening commentary from ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""

My friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer. Can your heart stand the shocking facts aboutEdward D. Wood Jr.?—Qrrbirbel The film opens with a thunderstorm. Lightning flashes illuminate a spooky old house, accompanied by the eerie wailing of a Theremin. The camera moves inside the house to reveal a coffin which opens and from the coffin Criswell sits up. (This is nearly identical to opening scene to Night of the Ghouls). Criswell offers an opening commentary which practically repeats the opening commentary from Plan 9 from Outer Space. Credits follow with most of the cast names displayed on tombstones (again similar to Plan 9). The camera moves from the Hollywood sign and down into Hollywood itself.It is a rainy night outside a dilapidated theater in Hollywood. It is the early 1950s. The eccentric and goof-ball theater director Edward D. Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp) is pacing outside, waiting for the press who have not shown to review his play The Casual Company, a World War II-esq military drama. The show finally goes on to an almost empty house. Later that night Ed, his close friend John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge (Bill Murray) and the three principal actors in the play, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), Paul Marco (Max Casella) and Conrad ""Connie"" Brooks (Brent Hinkley) read Victor Crowley's scathing review of the play. Everything about it is negative, but the only positive comment being about the realistic costumes. Ed tries to encourage the team that they're doing good work on account of that one positive comment, but later that night Ed, who is living with Dolores, expresses his doubts about his achieving success in the film industry. He worries that he's nearly thirty and Orson Welles, whom Ed idolizes, was 26-years old when he made ""Citizen Kane"". Dolores reassures him and then makes a comment to herself about never being able to find her clothes. Ed turns over in bed with a worried look on his face.A few days later, Ed is working in the props department at a film studio as his second job and he is asked to take a potted palm over to the executive offices. Ed makes a bit of a side trip to see some new stock footage the studio received, and comments that he could probably make a complete movie using just the stock footage. Later, in the office he overhears two office girls discussing an article in Variety about a bio-pic being considered about sex-change personality, Christine Jorgensen.Ed phones George Weiss (Mike Starr), head of Screen Classics, a small studio which specializes in soft-core sexploitation films, which was making the bio-pic. Ed assures him that he is the most qualified man in Hollywood to direct the sex-change film. Dolores, who was standing there when Ed said that, asks Ed why he's the most qualified for such a picture, but Ed scoffs it was just something to spark Weiss' interest in hiring Ed. Later Ed is talking to Weiss in his office who tells him that the Christine Jorgensen story is off. Christine heard about it fromVariety, and was asking for too much. Weiss was still planing a sex-change film though, but is now going to be something else. The film is to be called I Changed My Sex. He has no script yet or director. Ed tells him that he can direct and write the movie, and mentions the positive comment Crowley made about his play. Unconvinced, Weiss asks him why he is the most qualified man in Hollywood to do this movie. Reluctantly, Ed tells Weiss what he's never told anyone in his life: he's a transvestite. When Weiss asks, Ed assures him that he's still straight, and just does it for personal comfort, going even as far as to paratroop wearing women's undergarments when he fought in the Second World War. Weiss asks how this qualifies him for the movie. Ed believes that this can add an extra note of realism to the movie. Weiss tells Ed that he does not need someone who has a burning desire to tell his story; what he needs is someone who is experienced enough to shoot a film in only a few days while still making it profitable. Discouraged, Ed leaves.On his way home, Ed meets his long-time idol, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). He is leaving a funeral home complaining about the discomfort of the coffins. The two start talking, and Lugosi reveals that he soon intends on dying, fed up with his life. The two begin a close friendship as Ed drives Bela home to his small house. Ed learns that Bela has not worked in four years. Later at work, Ed is discussing Bela with a fellow film executive who calls Bela a ""washed-out junkie"". He suggests that if Ed thinks he is so great he should hire Bela himself.On Halloween night 1953, and Ed and Bela are watching White Zombie at Bela's home on the TV. The show breaks for a commercial, introduced by horror-show hostess Vampira (Lisa Marie) whom Bela refers to as ""a honey"". A short while later, Vampira makes a comment about the film starring Bela Lugosi ""and a bunch of other people I've never heard of"". This seems to depress Bela who goes into the back to take his ""medicine"". The medicine seems to work almost immediately and Bela is soon cheerfully scaring trick-or-treating children as Dracula, except for one little boy who Ed scares away by pulling out his fake teeth he got from WWII, amazing Lugosi.Using the promise of getting Bela to star in the movie for a low price, Ed convinces George Weiss to let him write and direct the movie. He finishes the script two days later and gives it to Dolores to read. He also uses the script to tell her about his own cross-dressing. He shows himself to her dressed in one of her angora jumpers. Dolores outbursts with rage and disgust that Ed has not only kept this secret from her for so long, but he now intends to fictionally exploit this embarrassing moment of their lives on film. However, he manages to persuade her to join the role of Barbara in the movie.Ed turns in his script to Weiss, and they have a heated argument over the script: the story is not what Weiss originally wanted to be made; what Weiss originally wanted is only briefly covered in the first five pages of the script while the rest of the story is a fictionalized version of Ed's situation. Even the title is conflicting, as the poster for the original title is still intact. Ed tells him to change the poster, as he believs that the changes he made are for the better. Giving up on the argument, George allows Ed to shoot the movie however he wants, as long as it meets the required reel length.They begin filming the movie, now re-titled 'Glen or Glenda', with Ed himself performing the title roles. When they get to filming Bela's scenes, there is a minor catastrophe when As Connie asks for Lugosi's autograph, he mentions The Invisible Ray alongside Boris Karloff. Bela gets highly upset about this, as Karloff was a major of rival of Lugosi's. However, Ed is able to calm Lugosi by convincing him of his success with Dracula, and Lugosi cooperates easier with the film. There is also trouble on the set as Dolores, who is playing the female lead Barbara, is having a very hard time accepting Ed's cross-dressing. However, the film is successfuly completed.Ed takes a film copy of Glen or Glenda to Mr. Feldman at Warners, seeking to get financial backing to continue making movies. He mentions several other projects he has planned, such as The Ghoul Goes West and Dr. Acula. Feldman seems uninterested those projects, but shows interest in another project Ed pitches, Bride of the Atom. Later Feldman and two subordinates view Glen Or Glenda, and are reduced to fits of helpless laughter by the horrible looking movie with bad sound, lighting, and acting.Days later, Ed finds that Glen or Glenda is not playing anywhere local. He phones the furious George Weiss who tells him that he could not sell it anywhere in the major markets, as the movie was so bad, the markets didn't want to bother presenting it, calling it a ""piece of shit."" Ed tells him not to insult his movie. Weiss wishes it was Ed's movie instead of his, wishing ""he had not blown every dime he had ever made into making this stink-bomb"". He angrily promises that if he ever sees Ed again, he will kill him.A few evenings later Ed, Dolores and Bunny are at a wrestling match. Bunny talks about his plans to go to Mexico and take the first steps leading to sex-reassignment, much to Dolores' discomfort. They later see in action Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (George 'The Animal' Steele), who Ed believes would make a fantastic actor, and would be perfect for Lobo, the monstrous henchman in Bride of the Atom. He convinces Tor to take the part.Some months later, Ed gets a call from Bela. When he arrives at Bela's home he finds Bela collapsed on the floor. He also finds a needle syringe which Bela tells him contains Morphine and Demerol. Bella breaks down and tells Ed that he is totally broke, and doesn't know what he's going to do to pay for his ""medication"". Ed reassures him that he won't let Bela down.The next day, Ed calls Feldman, who tells him that Glen or Glenda was the worst movie he ever saw, and hangs up on him. Discouraged, Ed talks to Dolores, who suggests that Ed may not be studio material, and should finance himself. Ed starts to try to line up backers by meeting them at the local Brown Derby Restaurant. One person he approaches is a producer of a comedy/variety TV series, who arranges to use Bela in a sketch.The sketch turns out to be a total fiasco, as Bela cannot follow the ad-libs of the comic. Backstage Ed and Bela meet ""psychic"" Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) who predicts that Bela's next project will be a huge success. Criswell even recognises Ed's name as the writer/director of ""Glen or Glenda"". Quickly Criswell becomes a member of Ed's growing entourage and tells Ed that showmanship is the secret to success.Over the next several months in 1955, Ed continues seeking financing for his next movie, helped by Dolores, Criswell and Tor, but without any success. One evening at a local nightclub, Ed encounters a young, attractive woman who introduces herself as Loretta King (Juliet Landau) who appears to be quite wealthy (she pays a three dollar bar tab with a $50 note). Still seeking financing, Ed soon convinces her to invest in Bride of the Atom. Loretta agrees to finance Ed's movie, but her only catch is that in exchange to be credited as one of the executive producers, she would also like to act in the movie. In fact she wants to take the lead role, which Ed had already promised to Dolores. Ed reluctantly agrees with Loretta so that he can make the movie. Dolores, however, is furious about this, especially when she finds she has been relegated to one of the minor roles.With Loretta's contribution in hand Ed begins filming, despite Loretta being a mediocre actress. Unfortunately, filming is soon shut down a few days later when the $300 advance that Loretta gave runs out. It turns out that the $300 was all the money that Loretta had. So Ed goes back out on the financing trail. While talking to some potential investors at the Brown Derby, he meets Vampira at the restaurant with her entourage of her agent, manager, publicist, producer, etc. He tries to interest her in helping to get some backers, but her reluctance ends up losing backers.Ed ends up talking to meat packer Donald McCoy, a redneck hick who is willing to advance Ed the rest of the money he needs, but McCoy's condition is that he wants the movie to end with a big explosion, and that the lead male role to go to his son Tony. After making the suggested changes, filming resumes, but not without problems. At one point there is a very tense encounter between Dolores and Loretta in the dressing room over Dolores still angry and jealous at Loretta for taking the lead role which Ed promised her first.That night, Ed, Paul, Connie, Criswell, and Tor break into the prop warehouse at Republic Studios to ""borrow"" a rubber octopus to be used in the climactic scene between Dr. Vornoff (Bela), and his octopus. The following night, while on location in the Hollywood Hills to film that scene, they realise that they forgot to borrow the octopus motor, so when they are filming the scene Ed tells Bela to just ""Shake his legs around so it looks like he's killing you"". At first Bela seems to be unable to do the scene, but after injecting himself with a dose of his ""medicine"" he is alright again.On the final day of shooting, Ed requests Bela to say one more line he wrote up. Amazed and swayed away by what Ed wrote, he agrees to it. It is his character's famous closing speech in the movie.At the wrap party the next night, held in McCoy's butcher shop, Ed, once more in drag, does a strip act. This is the last straw, and Dolores explodes, pronouncing all of Ed's work terrible, and that everybody is wasting their lives for nothing. She storms out, and Ed catches up with her. She ends her relationship with Ed on the spot.In April 1955, Ed gets another phone call from Bela, whom he finds suicidal and wants Ed to join him. Ed talks Bela out of it, and Bela decides to commit himself into a hospital for his drug addiction. Bela uses his rehabilitation to get some publicity and to get his name back in the press.In the hospital while waiting to visit Bela, Ed meets Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette), a very sweet young woman who is visiting her father at the hospital. Ed becomes strangely attracted to her. He tells her that he is a writer, producer, actor, and director in motion pictures. The two go out on a date to a midway carnival. They take a ride through the spook house, which breaks down halfway through the ride. While stranded, Ed confesses to Kathy about his cross-dressing. After Ed assures her that he's still straight when she asks, she accepts it without further question.The next morning, Ed gets some bad news from the sanitarium. Bela's insurance has long since lapsed and as a result Bela will not be able to stay any longer. Ed offers to pay all he has to help Bela, but the small amount of money he has will barely help. Ed convinces Bela that he is cured, and takes him home. Bela wonders when Ed's next picture will be coming. To help Bela, Ed invests the last of his cash in some film and a camera rental. He and Bela film several scenes of generic stock footage outside Bela's house that Ed could use almost anywhere for his next movie.Some months later in early 1956, Ed invites Vampira to join the party going to the premiere of his movie, now re-titled Bride of the Monster. Ed, Kathy, Vampira, Criswell, Bela, and Tor go in Ed's car to the theater. The audience is extremely rowdy over the horrible-looking movie and after only a few minutes into the picture Ed begins to fear for the safety of his guests, especially Kathy, Bela, and Vampira. They leave in time to catch a gang stripping down Ed's car. The crowd soon leaves the theater also roaring in anger at being cheated out of their money to watch a bad movie. They hail a taxi; in fact Kathy almost has to jump in front of it to get it to stop. As they drive away, Bela sarcasticaly remarks, ""now THAT was a premiere!""The next day, Ed and Bela are walking along a sidewalk in Los Angeles and talking. Bela tells Ed that he has found a very special woman in Kathy. They talk about the premiere and Ed wishes that Bela could have seen the whole movie. Bela says he doesn't really need to, he remembers it all, and proves it by quoting his closing speech to an appreciative impromptu audience on the street.One night another few months later, Ed is reading a story to Kathy when they are interrupted by phone call where someone on the other line tells him that Bela has passed away. Ed, Kathy, Tor, Criswell, Vampira, Connie, and Paul are all among the mourners at Bela's funeral. It is also seen that Bela was buried in his Dracula cape.Another year or so later, Ed is visited by his landlord, J. Edward Reynolds (Clive Rosengren). Reynolds reveals that Ed skipped his final rent check. Ed believes that his stockholder probably transfered the wrong account and writes him a check. Reynolds notices that Ed is in the picture business, and mentions that he and his Baptist church are interested in making inspirational films about the twelve apostles. At the present time though they only have the money for one. Seeing opportunity, Ed tells Reynolds that if he took that money and put it into a commercially proven genre, he would make enough to make the twelve movies. As it happens, Ed has a script he wrote available, entitled Grave Robbers from Outer Space. Reynolds is unsure, as most big movies have big stars. Ed reveals that it does: Bela Lugosi. Reynolds thought Lugosi passed on. Ed has the last film Bela did, and he just needs to hire a double to complete Bela's scenes, convincing him that if the movie succeeds, he'll have enough to not just make all twelve films, but possibly even more. Reynolds agrees, and final preparations begin for the movie.When Ed learns that Vampira has been laid off, he, along with Kathy at a diner, convince her to take a part in the film. She is reluctant, but Kathy tells her that she should be grateful that Ed is the only one offering her a job. She agrees, but she will only do it mute. At the diner, Ed meets Dr. Tom Mason, Kathy's chiropractor. When he walks over to correct her aching neck, Ed senses a resemblance to Lugosi with his face covered and Ed hires him to be Bela's double.Reynolds will only support the movie if Ed and his companions are baptized into his church. So that Sunday, Ed, Kathy, Vampira, Tor, Criswell, Bunny, Mason, Paul, and Connie are received into the local Baptist church. Tor is too large to fit into the regular baptismal font, so the mass baptism is held in a nearby swimming pool.In 1958, filming begins but with many problems. Reynolds and his associate Reverend Lemons (G.D. Spradlin) have issues with the script's content about graverobbing, finding the concept blasphemous, and the title Grave Robbers from Outer Space which Reynolds requests it being changed to Plan 9 From Outer Space. They question Ed for having Tor delivering several lines of dialogue, who is nearly unintelligible due to his thick Swedish accent. Bunny, who is playing the alien leader, is insisting on antenna or glitter for his costume. Reynolds questions Ed's directing skills after Paul and Connie, (playing policemen) fall (knocked down by the passage of the 'flying saucer') and knock over one of the cardboard tombstones in the graveyard set, as well as using daylight stock shots setting up for night scenes. The final straw is when Gregory Walcott, their choir conductor at their baptist church, suddenly arrives on set and the baptists reveal to Ed that they've casted him as the lead hero. Ed outbursts that since he's the director, he does the casting. He storms off in the dressing room. To relax, Ed puts on his women's clothing only to be chastised even more by Reynolds and Lemons.Having enough, Ed storms out of the studio and goes to a nearby bar (still in drag). In the bar Ed meets his idol, Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio). The two begin talking and Orson reminisces about his problems with the film business, with losing financial backings for their film projects and their producers always interfering with their work, whether it be recutting their orignal cuts or casting actors that they have personal connections with, not caring if they're right for the roles. Ed asks if the film business is worth it in spite of the trouble. Reminding Ed that Kane was the one film where he had complete control, he tells Ed that ultimately the business is worthwhile, and inspires Ed by telling him that it's worth fighting for his artistic visions.Revived, Ed returns to the studio and tells Reynolds that Ed is going to finish the movie as he wants it to be, as it is not right for Reynolds to interfere with his artistic vision. Lemons objects; they're the ones funding the movie, so it should be their way. Ed immediately rebuttles that they'll make their profits back, but only if they stay out of Ed's way and let him finish the film his way.Ed continues filming the movie against his producers, but decides to agree with the title change after personally deciding it sounded better. Scene after scene are filmed with Ed growing more and more proud of the whole production.On opening night in 1959, he and Kathy drive to the theater in Ed's (repaired) convertible. As they arrive, it begins to rain and thunder, much like the storm in the opening scenes. The top gets stuck open, and finally Ed leaves it so that they can make the premire. He introduces it simply ""For Bela"". As the film runs, Ed is again in the wings silently repeating the dialogue. He says to himself: ""This is it. This is the one I'll be remembered for"".As ""Plan 9"" closes he proposes to Kathy, and the two drive off in his soaked car to marry in Las Vegas. The camera moves back from the area to focus on the Hollywood sign again.The movie ends with short biographical comments about the major characters and their lives after Plan 9 from Outer Space...Edward D. Wood Jr. kept on struggling in Hollywood, but mainstream success eluded him. He descended into obscurity, as well as alcoholism while continuing to direct grade-B monster and soft core sex films. He died from a heart attack in 1978 at age 54. Two years after his death, he was voted ""Worst Director of All Time"" bringing him worldwide attention and a new generation of fans.Kathy O'Hara Wood remained married to Ed for nearly 20 years and was loyal to him through all ups and downs. After his death, she never remarried.The late Bela Lugosi never rose from the grave but after appearing in 103 films during his 40 year career, he is more famous then ever.

He died in 1971.Vampira retired from show business shortly after Plan 9's release to sell handcrafted jewelry. In the 1980s, she unsuccessfully sued horror hostess Elvira for stealing her act and appearance.Paul Marco and Conrad Brooks are still personalities in the Hollywood scene and continue to act in numerous low-budget 'B' movies. Paul is currently the founder and president of the Paul Marco fan club. Conrad was recently named the ""John Gielgud of Bad Movies"" by the New York Times.Dr. Tom Mason, the late chiropractor who doubled for the late Bela on Plan 9, appeared in one more Ed Wood film Night of the Ghouls. This time, Ed let him show his face.Criswell continued making highly inaccurate and bizarre psychic predictions and was often a guest on The Tonight Show featuring Johnny Carson. He died in 1982."

This psychological thriller is true to its subjects as well as being complex, dynamic, and overly dramatic. How something so long ago, seemingly trivial, years later with more significant trauma, turns repressed emotions into a dysfunctional life and distorted thinking. This is all merged into a psychological menagerie that unfolds piece by piece to perfection.—benignjamin The intertwined stories of a cast of characters at an exotic men's club called Exotica in Toronto are presented. The club itself is owned by Zoe, who inherited the business from her mother. Zoe hired Eric to be the club's main DJ and announcer, the two who entered into another mixed business/personal arrangement. Christina is one of the club's dancers/strippers, her on-stage persona being the naughty Catholic schoolgirl. She got the job at the club through Eric, the two who used to date. Francis, one of the club's regulars, always has Christina dance at his table for him, those dances which Eric continually tells the club's patrons over the loudspeaker are only $5 a dance. Francis and Christina's relationship seems to be more than just a business one, something that Eric notices. While Francis is at the club once every couple of nights, he has made an arrangement with his teenaged niece Tracey - the daughter of his wheelchair-bound brother, Harold - who he drives to/from his house for her to practice her music on his grand piano. Their arrangement is an unofficial business one which bothers Tracey. When an incident happens at the club which involves Francis, he asks Thomas, a gay pet shop owner he met through work, to do him a favor in helping him resolve the incident at the club to his satisfaction. What happens with this collective of people, as their underlying stories and connections are revealed, is set against the backdrop of a missing person's case with a tragic ending.—Huggo Francis spends his evenings at Exotica, an up-market strip club.

They are watched by Eric (Elias Koteas) the club DJ who has a past history with Christina, and who also functions as bouncer when clients violate rules by touching the performers. An accountant by trade, Francis arrives at the pet shop of Thomas the next day to examine his accounting books, unaware that the smuggler has a rare exotic egg at his house that he is incubating. Later that night while attending an opera performance Thomas picks up a man who happens to be the customs officer who had watched him at the airport. Later when the customs officer steals the egg from Thomas, we learn that Francis is part of a larger investigation to see where Thomas has untaxed coming in to his business. The relationship of Eric and Christina is a love affair that has gone sour mainly because Eric made a deal with club owner Zoe (Arsine Khanjian) to allow her to have his child.

Three Colors: Red,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111495/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A model discovers a retired judge is keen on invading people's privacy. Valentine is a young model living in Geneva. Because of a dog she ran over, she meets a retired judge who spies his neighbours' phone calls, not for money but to feed his cynicism. The film is the story of relationships between some human beings, Valentine and the judge, but also other people who may not be aware of the relationship they have with Valentine or/and the old judge. Redemption, forgiveness and compassion...—Yepok A young model's (Jacob) life is changed forever after a chance encounter with her neighbour (Trintignant), a retired judge whose hobby is to listen in on his neighbours' phone calls. The last and most acclaimed of Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, the film was nominated for three 1994 Academy Awards (Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography). The film begins with clips that track a telephone call between London and Geneva, where a French university student and part-time model, Valentine Dusot (Irène Jacob), is talking to her emotionally infantile but possessive boyfriend. During her work as a model, she poses for a chewing-gum campaign, during the photo shoot the photographer asks her to look very sad. While walking back home Auguste, a neighbor of Valentine's, drops a set of books and he notices that a particular chapter of the Criminial Code was open at random and he concentrates on that passage.While driving back to her apartment, Valentine accidentally runs over a dog. She tracks down the owner, a reclusive retired judge, Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis Trintignant). He seems unconcerned by the accident or the injuries sustained by Rita, his dog. Valentine takes Rita to a veterinarian, where she learns that Rita is pregnant. Valentine takes the dog home.The next day, she talks to her boyfriend over the phone and relates how she came to acquire the dog. He becomes angry since they initially met when she ran over his dog accidentally some years before, and wants her to take the dog back.While walking Rita, the dog runs off again and Valentine figures that it went home to Kern, where she finally finds the dog. He says that Rita is now hers since he wishes for nothing in life. Earlier that day she had received a lot of money in the mail and she figures out that it was Kern who sent her the money to pay for the veterinarian's bill, but he got the amount wrong. Kern goes inside to get some change but does not come back out. Valentine wanders into his house and finds him listening to his neighbors' private telephone conversations. Valentine is appalled and threatens to denounce Kern to his neighbors. Kern challenges her to do this and points out one neighbor's residence. At first, she goes to do so, but does not tell them anything, seeing that their daughter is also listening in on the conversation. She goes back to Kern and asks him to stop eavesdroping but he replies that he has been doing it all his life, but now he knows where to find the truth.Kern points out an attractive man to Valentine in his window. He suspects him to run the entire heroin market in Geneva but cannot hear his calls because he uses a Japanese phone. Valentine insults him and Kern concludes that she has a strong feeling against drugs, and after a bit of conversation Kern figures out that Valentine's feelings towards drugs stem from a piece of news in her paper and a photo of a young man, her brother, who discovered that he is not his father's son and has been using drugs for a year. Kern tells her that it shall make no difference that she denounces him for his spying, the people's lives he listens to shall eventually turn into hell. She leaves saying that she feels nothing but pity for him.While visiting Kern, Valentine also hears a conversation between Karin and Auguste, where they discuss if they should go bowling. Valentine covers her ears, but from the very little she heard she concludes that they love each other. Kern disagrees. That evening Valentine is alone at home and hopes that her boyfriend shall call but it is the photographer who calls, saying that her poster was set up that evening and asks her bowling to celebrate.Meanwhile, Auguste takes his exam and passes it and becomes a judge. Karin asks him if he was asked any questions regarding the article that was open when he dropped his books. Auguste says 'yes'. Karin gives him a fountain pen as a gift and he wonders what the first judgment he signs with it will be.That evening, Kern writes a series of letters to his neighbors and denounces himself, and the community files a class action suit against him. At the law courts, he sees Karin meeting another man. Earlier, Auguste had missed a call from Karin and tried to call her back but never hears from her again.Valentine reads in her paper a piece of news about a retired judge that spied on his neighbors and she goes to Kern telling him that she said nothing to anybody. He confesses that it was him just to see what she would do. He asks her in and shows her that Rita has had seven puppies. They discuss that on their last conversation she spoke about pity but he later realized that it was actually disgust. He wonders about the reasons why people obey laws and it turns out that often it is more on selfish grounds and from fear than about obeying the law or being decent. It is his birthday and they have a couple of drinks. During their conversation he reminisces about a sailor he acquitted a long time ago, only later realizing he had made a mistake, and that the man was guilty. However the man later married and had children and later grandchildren and lives peacefully and happy. Valentine says that he did what he had to do, but Kern wonders how many other people that he acquitted or condemned might have seen a different life had he decided otherwise; he sympathizes with them and with his neighbors who have been throwing stones at his windows, saying that in their circumstances and being them he might have done the same, but in his role as judge he never stepped out of his shoes and never really understood other people. He also suggests that being in a position of deciding what is truth and what is not is a lack of modesty and vanity on behalf of humankind. When the conversation turns to Kerns' past romantic life he avoids the question by telling her about a dream he had about her. Valentine tells Kern about her intended trip to England to visit her boyfriend. Kern suggests that she take the ferry.Meanwhile, Auguste is unable to reach his girlfriend Karin since graduation. One evening he goes to her place and sees her legs wrapped around another man. Distraught, he leaves. By chance Auguste sees Karin and her new boyfriend in a restaurant, he gets her attention but when she rushes outside to try to explain he hides from her. Kern calls Karin's personalized weather service and inquires about the weather in the English Channel, which she expects to be perfect as she is about to take a trip there (with her new boyfriend who owns a boat).The day before Valentine leaves, she invites Kern to a fashion show where she is modeling. After the show, they speak about the dream he had about her, where she was 50 years old and happy with an unidentified man. The conversation then turns to him and the reasons why he disliked Karin. Kern reveals that before becoming a judge, he was in love with a woman very much like Karin, who betrayed him for another man. While preparing for his exam he once went to the same theater where the fashion show took place and he accidentally dropped one of his books. When he picked it up, Kern studied the chapter where the book accidentally opened, which turned out to be the crucial question at his examination. When he broke up with his girlfriend he followed her across the English Channel but never saw her again, because she died in an accident. Later, he was assigned to judge a case where the defendant was the same man who took his girlfriend from him. Regardless of this connection, Kern did not recuse himself from the case, since the connection was only known to him and condemned the man, the judgment was legal but he subsequently resigned his post.Valentine takes her ferry to England, and Auguste is also on the ferry, although the two never quite meet each other. Suddenly a storm rises and sinks both the ferry and the boat with Karin and her boyfriend.In the final scene, Judge Kern views a newsreel report about the sinking, and learns that of the 1,435 passengers and crew, only seven survivors were rescued. By coincidence the survivors are the main characters from the first two films of the trilogy; Julie and Olivier from 'Blue'; Karol and Dominique from 'White'; and Valentine and Auguste, who finally meet for the first time, as well as an English bartender named Stephen Killian. As with the other movies, the film's final sequence shows a character crying - in this case, the judge - over the events that has transpired... but the final image replicates the iconic chewing-gum poster of Valentine."

It's the early 1960s. Nuclear engineer Hank Marshall is a major in the US Army, he who works on top secret nuclear testing projects. Trouble follows him from posting to posting largely because of his mentally unstable wife, Carly Marshall, who is bipolar. During her manic phases, her already overt sexuality, which she models after such sex symbols asMarilyn MonroeandBrigitte Bardot, is ratcheted up a notch, that partying behavior which is mixed with less frequent phases of physically destructive behavior. Regardless, Hank and Carly love each other, Hank who would admit to himself that he enjoys the fact that other men find Carly attractive, which is partly why he allows her to act the way she does in public. In turn, they mutually love their now two teenaged daughters, Alex and Becky. Reassigned from their two year posting in Hawaii largely due to the ruckus Carly has caused there, they are next sent to Alabama, the base under the command of Vince Johnson, his wife, Vera Johnson, who heads the wives' welcoming committee. At an age of starting to test her own sexuality, Alex starts to date the Johnsons' son, Glenn. Due to no fault of his own, Hank faces some problems in the latest project on which he is working, code named Blue Sky.

The move to Alabama sends her into the arms of base commander Vince Johnson.—Jwelch5742 It's the early 1960s. Hank Marshall is a tough, square-jawed, strait-laced Army engineer and nuclear science expert, assigned to help conduct weapons-testing in America. Hank has become a thorn in the side of the US Army, though, for a couple of very different reasons. He is an outspoken opponent of atmospheric testing, though his superiors hold contrary views and want to squelch his concerns - and his reports. The other problem is his wife, Carly Marshall, who is voluptuous, fun-loving and emotionally vulnerable. Her antics are wreaking havoc in his personal life and stirring up intrigue at each Army base. While he's conducting A-bomb tests in Nevada, she succumbs to the advances of his superior officer. However, her infidelity is not the only dilemma that the Marshalls have to face. When a deadly military cover-up puts Hank in jeopardy, it's up to Carly to muster the courage and strength to save the man she loves.—Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> In 1962, Major Hank Marshall and his wife, Carly, are having marital problems because of the pressures of his job and her mental illness. Hank is a nuclear engineer who favors underground nuclear testing, an initiative code-named ""Blue Sky"", as opposed to above-ground, open-air detonations. Carly is a free spirit who appears to be mentally unbalanced and who is slowly being suffocated by domestic torpor and encroaching age. Her behavior embarrasses him, especially given the restrictions that prevail within a military base. Their move from Hawaii to an isolated base in Alabama alarms their oldest daughter, Alex, and sends Carly into a violent tantrum.The following day, Hank has his first meeting with base commander Colonel Vince Johnson, who rebuffs his underground testing initiative despite strong scientific support.

Hank is sent to the Nevada Test Site to supervise the first underground test under Lieutenant Colonel Robert Jennings.During the first test, Hank notices two cowboys in the test area and attempts to have Robert abort the test, but Robert refuses, explicitly telling Hank that he is not concerned with the cowboys' health or their lives, and sends Hank back to Alabama. While Hank is away, Alex and Glen discover Vince sent Hank away just so he could have an affair with Carly.Hank learns of the affair at the dance recital and reacts violently, after which he is given two options: have his wife and commanding officer court-martialed with him, or spend time in a psychiatric hospital receiving therapy over how the news has affected him. In debating the decision it quickly comes to light that a court martial would require bringing the incident with the cowboys out in public. Hank is eventually committed to the hospital.The hospital keeps him so heavily sedated he is unable to leave. Carly, suspecting there is a reason for this, digs through Hank's papers and finds the report about the two cowboys. She drives across the country with her daughters and finds the cowboys with visible radiation sickness.

While still enamored of his high-school sweetheart Caitlin, he now has a serious relationship with long-suffering Veronica, who wants him to quit his job and begin college. His best friend Randal, who runs the next-door video store, is even less dedicated to his job than Dante. The movie covers one eventful day at the job.—Reid Gagle Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is a clerk at the Quick Stop, a local convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey. On Dante's day off, his boss calls him in to cover a few hours for another employee who is sick. Arriving at the store, he finds that padlocks for the security shutters are jammed closed with chewing gum, so he hangs a sheet over them with a message in shoe polish: I ASSURE YOU; WE'RE OPEN! Dante is flustered at having to open the store at 6 AM when he'd just closed it the night before. He's also upset that he hasn't gotten enough sleep before having to play a street hockey game that afternoon.Dante's day is spent in the purgatory of serving a succession of clueless and oblivious customers while bemoaning the fact that ""I'm not even supposed to be here today!"" His earliest customer is a man who tries to convince cigarette-buying customers that they should buy chewing gum, Chewlies brand, instead of smoking. To emphasize his point, the man shows a customer what he claims is a diseased lung that he carries in a bag. Before long, a crowd has gathered at the checkout and turns hostile at the first customer's taunts and rantings, blaming Dante for the ills of smoking because he sells cigarettes. When they start pelting him with cigarettes, Dante's girlfriend, Veronica, appears and sprays them all with a fire extinguisher, bringing them under control. She confronts the man who recommended the chewing gum, finding out he's a representative of the Chewlies brand trying to drum up sales. She orders him out along with the mob, chiding them for having nothing better to do with their lives.Dante and Veronica talk for a bit behind the counter about their past relationships. After a few minutes, Veronica gets up to leave and sees an old flame of hers, a guy nicknamed ""Snowball"". She admits to Dante that she'd performed oral sex on him and the conversation quickly escalates into an argument. She tells him that she performed fellatio on 36 other guys before she dated Dante. Dante jealously considers her past acts to be more severe than his own, which include having had sex with 11 other women before Veronica. Veronica storms out, furious with Dante's insensitivity.Interspersed with the demands of his job, Dante passes time in wide-ranging conversations with his slacker friend, Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson). Randal ostensibly works at the RST Video Store right next door, although he spends almost the entire day at the Quick Stop and is not averse to treating customers with contempt. The two converse about many things to pass time, such as whether the independent contractors working on the second Death Star when it was destroyed at the end of Return of the Jedi might have been innocent victims of the Rebels' efforts to defeat the Empire. Another customer offers support for Randall's theory when he tells the duo that he passed up a contracting job on a mobster's house and the contractor that took the job was killed when the house was bombed.Veronica stops in again, bringing Dante lasagna for lunch. The two reconcile about their respective sexual pasts -- in an earlier conversation with Randal, Dante realizes that his sexual history is no better than Veronica's. She and Dante also talk about Dante's current disposition -- he's in a rut with no motivation to change -- Dante had attended college for a short period and dropped out. Veronica had transferred to a nearby university to be closer to Dante. Further contributing to Dante's misery is an announcement shown him by Randal in the local newspaper that his famously unfaithful ex-girlfriend, Caitlin, is engaged to be married. For the previous several weeks Dante had been secretly talking to Caitlin on the phone, rekindling their relationship. Dante also talks to Randal about how Caitlin had frequently been unfaithful to Dante, once even mistaking him for another man at a party they'd both gone to separately. Randal suggests that Dante stay with Veronica since she really loves him and that Caitlin isn't worth going back to because of her infidelity.Learning that he's stuck working the store all day because his relief skipped out to go to Vermont on vacation and the owner of the store and building is nowhere to be found, Dante convinces his friends to play hockey on the store roof. The game is short; 12 minutes into the 1st period, an irate customer climbs the ladder to the roof, demanding that Dante open the store. When the guy criticizes Dante's playing, Dante angrily invites him to play in their game. The guy wastes no time knocking Dante over in the face off and shoots their only ball off the roof and into a storm drain.Reopening the store, Dante finds out one another of his ex-girlfriends has died and her memorial service is today. Randal talks him into closing the store again and going to the wake. The visit is disastrous, and the two are seen leaving the funeral home in a hurry and driving away, although the audience doesn't see what transpires during the memorial service. However, a conversation moments later between the two reveals that Randal knocked over the casket. Randal seems indifferent to the chaos he caused, callously saying that the dead friend didn't feel a thing.While talking to a couple of former high-school classmates, Dante finds out that the man he's talking to, Rick Derris, was one of Caitlin's flings while she was still dating Dante. Another man enters the store and asks Dante if he's been working there all day. After a few moments, he hands Dante a court summons; Dante had allegedly sold cigarettes to an underage girl, whose mother had called the authorities. However, Dante had not been at the counter at the time, Randal had and had sold the girl the cigarettes. Dante now faces incontestable charges and a $500 fine. While he chases after the official and Derris in protest, Caitlin (Lisa Spoonhauer) suddenly appears, a surprise visit.Dante takes her to the video store for a private conversation. After she assures Dante that the engagement announcement was a premature and arranged by her overbearing and domineering mother, the two trade banter and Dante becomes torn between her and Veronica. He finally decides to take Caitlin on a date and slips home to change. He returns to discover that Caitlin has had sex with a dead man in the bathroom, having mistaken the man for Dante (the man had earlier entered the bathroom with a pornographic magazine and had suffered a fatal heart attack while masturbating). An ambulance takes Caitlin away in shock, along with the corpse.Meanwhile, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), a pair of stoners who've spent all day hanging out (and dealing marijuana) outside the Quick Stop, enter the store to shoplift. Dante turns down Jay's offer to party with them. Knowing Dante's predicament, Silent Bob pauses before following Jay outside and offers the following wisdom: ""You know, there's a million fine-looking women in the world, dude. But they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of 'em just cheat on you.""Dante then realizes that he loves Veronica. When she returns to the Quick Stop, though, Randal complicates things by revealing that Dante was in love with Caitlin and is planning to date his ex again. Veronica angrily breaks up with Dante and reveals to him that Randal told her of his plans to be with Caitlin. Dante finally loses his temper and fights with Randal, making a mess of the store. Afterward, while they sit in the mess they created, Dante continues to bemoan his station in life and being stuck in a dead end job, having a girlfriend who had sex with a dead man, and that Veronica had an active sex life before she and Dante began dating. Finally losing his own temper, Randall yells back at Dante and counters everything by telling Dante that he's sick of hearing him whine about how rotten his life is and that Dante needs to think about making serious changes in his life if he wants it to improve.The film ends with the two reconciling and cleaning up the store for the night. At Dante's request, Randal ""rangles"" out, popping back in briefly to toss Dante's sign at him stating, ""You're closed!"""

Heavenly Creatures,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110005/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two teenage girls share a unique bond; their parents, concerned that the friendship is too intense, separate them, and the girls take revenge. Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme met in school during the 1950s. Instant best friends, they proceeded to spend every minute possible together, often writing about a fantasy land of their own invention. More and more estranged from their respective families, the two girls realise that they are extremely different from most other people, and agree to take any steps necessary to ensure that they are not separated. The two families are increasingly concerned about the girls' friendship in a strictly moralistic era.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> In June of 1954, two teenage girls, both drenched in blood, run screaming through a scenic park. They burst into a tea shop and hysterically inform the startled owner that ""Mummy"" has been ""terribly hurt.""In 1952, fourteen-year-old Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a student at a strict all-girls high school in Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand. She resides with her working-class parents, Herbert and Honora (Simon O'Connor and Sarah Peirse), whose home doubles as a boarding house. Introverted Pauline sleeps in a small furnished hut in the yard.Pauline's life changes dramatically when she befriends wealthy British transfer student Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), the daughter of a respected physicist. Pauline's quiet nature is countered by Juliet's charisma and outspokenness, and the girls quickly become inseparable. Juliet is unafraid of authority, impressing Pauline by fearlessly correcting their French teacher during class and by ignoring their art teacher's instructions altogether. They are the only two girls in their class forbidden from taking part in gym activities, due to histories of bone disease on Pauline's part, and lung disease on Juliet's. They spend these class periods bonding over their passions for music, art, film, and literature. They create a fantasy kingdom called Borovina, about which they write stories, create models of the characters, and eventually interact with each other as the invented king and queen, Charles (Pauline) and Deborah (Juliet). They also elaborate on Juliet's theory of the afterlife, ""the Fourth World,"" where they believe their favorite film stars and musicians will be saints. The girls hope to one day become famous actresses in America, and to have their stories about Borovina published.Pauline begins to spend extensive time at the Hulme house with Juliet and her parents, Henry and Hilda (Clive Merrison and Diana Kent), and Juliet's younger brother Jonathan (Ben Skjellerup), even joining them on vacations. During this time, Pauline sees the dysfunction that exists within the Hulme family. Juliet has deep abandonment issues, stemming from her childhood when her parents left her in the Bahamas for five years to recover from a bout of illness. When Dr. and Mrs. Hulme mention they are planning a trip to London without their children, Juliet is very upset and becomes even more invested in her relationship with Pauline, continuing to construct an alternate reality of bliss and hopefulness that becomes increasingly real to both girls.Shortly before her parents' departure, Juliet contracts tuberculosis and is sent to a clinic for four months. At the beginning of her stay, her parents, somewhat reluctantly, tell her that it's not too late to cancel their trip to London if she would prefer them to stay, but they quickly change the subject and bid Juliet a hasty goodbye. Juliet is miserable at being abandoned by her parents again, especially during another bout of illness, and remains angry until she is visited by Pauline and Honora. The girls are overjoyed to see each other again, although Honora appears slightly concerned about the intensity and closeness of the friendship. After the visit, Pauline and Juliet continue to communicate via frequent letters, detailing the lives of Charles and Deborah alongside their own.With Juliet still recovering, Pauline begins to seek new experiences to fill the emotional void. She allows the persistent affections of John (Jed Brophy), an awkward young man boarding at the Rieper's house who claims to be in love with Pauline and comes to her room at night. Though Pauline is annoyed by his presence and is not attracted to him, she allows him to climb into bed with her. They are caught together by Pauline's father, who evicts John and is deeply upset by his daughter's behavior. Her mother is furious as well, calling her a ""tart"" who brings shame on their family, and forces Pauline to move back into the main house where she can be kept out of trouble. Pauline routinely sneaks out to see John, whom she calls ""Nicholas"" after one of her and Juliet's characters from Borovina, and consents to sex with him simply out of resentment for her parents.When Juliet is well enough to return home, their relationship only grows in intensity. Juliet's father Henry is disturbed with the obsessive behaviors of the girls, and meets with Pauline's parents to reveal his concerns. Though he admits that he has seen no explicitly inappropriate behavior, he recommends that Pauline see a friend of his, Dr. Bennett (Gilbert Goldie), who has a background in child psychology. Honora agrees.After interviewing a sullen Pauline, Dr. Bennett tells Honora that Pauline is likely going through a homosexual phase, but that it will likely wear off with maturity. With homosexuality being considered a mental illness at the time (not to mention the social implications from the largely Catholic community), the parents of the girls agree that the friendship must taper off.Meanwhile, Hilda Hulme's affair with her marriage counseling patient, Bill Perry (Peter Elliott), is discovered by Henry and they agree to divorce. Henry resigns from his position as rector of the University of Canterbury and plans to move back to England. After receiving the news of her parents' separation, Juliet is told that she will be sent to live with a relative in South Africa. The Hulmes insist that the move is for the good of Juliet's health, as the warm climate will be easier on her lungs, but Juliet is heartbroken at the thought of leaving Pauline. Both sets of parents agree to let the girls spend three weeks together before the move. Pauline makes a desperate plea to her mother, begging to be allowed to go to South Africa with Juliet, but Honora refuses to consider it. Pauline begins to despise her mother for her role in breaking up the relationship, which had endured and blossomed for the past two years, and her thoughts turn violent as her time with Juliet begins to run out.After viewing an Orson Welles film at the local cinema, Juliet and Pauline return home to Juliet's house where they finally consummate their feelings towards each other and make love for the first time. With their romantic bond cemented, Juliet and Pauline entertain a rather flimsy plan to run away together to America, but following the scheme's collapse, they decide to kill Pauline's mother to remove what they believe to be the chief obstacle to their fantasy life.On June 22, 1954, they arrange an outing with Honora to Victoria Park, where the three of them stop for tea before going for a walk in the woods. After a bit of hiking, Juliet distracts Honora by discreetly dropping a pink gemstone onto the path and directing Honora's attention to it. While Honora is bent over examining the stone, Pauline extracts a brick in a stocking from her purse. She and Juliet take turns bludgeoning Honora until she is dead, and then run screaming, covered in blood, back to the tea shop where they tell the shopkeeper that Honora has been ""terribly hurt"" in an accidental fall.The final scenes are a montage black and white fantasy segment of Juliet's parents taking her away on a ship while Pauline watches from the docks as she and her one true love, Juliet, are separated forever as a result of their murderous actions.The film closes with an on-screen text saying that the girls' story of Honora's ""accidental"" death quickly dissolves, and both are arrested after police find Pauline's diary which explicitly outlined their murder plan. Pauline is charged under her mother's maiden name, Parker, after it was discovered that her parents were not legally wed. Being too young for the death penalty, Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker were convicted of murder, served five years in prison, and were released in late 1959 under the condition that they never resume contact. Juliet returned to England with her mother, while Pauline remained in New Zealand until 1965 when she left for an unknown destination. They never saw each other again."

The Hudsucker Proxy,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110074/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A naive business graduate is installed as president of a manufacturing company as part of a stock scam. When Waring Hudsucker, head of hugely successful Hudsucker Industries, commits suicide, his board of directors, led by Sidney Mussberger, comes up with a brilliant plan to make a lot of money: appoint a moron to run the company. When the stock falls low enough, Sidney and friends can buy it up for pennies on the dollar, take over the company, and restore its fortunes. They choose idealistic Norville Barnes, who just started in the mail room. Norville is whacky enough to drive any company to ruin, but soon, tough reporter Amy Archer smells a rat and begins an undercover investigation of Hudsucker Industries.—Reid Gagle It's December 1st, 1958 and everything at Hudsucker Industries is going great. Profits and the stock price have never been so high, so it is shocking when President Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) runs down the table at the Board of Directors meeting and throws himself out the 45th floor window of the Hudsucker building. Despite this tragedy, vice-president Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) quickly focuses the board on the problem that Waring's death has left them: With no designated heir his 51 percent share of stock will be sold to the public one month from that day. The board would like to buy the stock and retain control of the company, but at the current price, they cannot afford it.Mussburger comes up with a plan to depress the stock price by temporarly putting an obviously incompetent person in the President's seat. But who can he find that is stupid enough to qualify?Fortunately, for him, Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) has just arrived in town with a brand new degree from the Muncie, Indiana, School of Business. Barnes has an idea for a new product, which he shows to everybody he meets. Unfortunately it appears to only be a circle drawn on a piece of paper as Barnes has a problem explaining exactly what he has in mind.Barnes is working in the Hudsucker mailroom the morning of Waring's death and as the new boy is given the unenviable task of taking a high-priority ""Blue letter"" (they are always bad news) up to Mussburger's office. Before delivering the letter Barnes first tries to show Mussburger his idea for his new product and in the process sets an important contract on fire and nearly causes Mussburger to fall out the window. In all this, however, Mussburger realizes he had found the perfect dupe to take the president's job.With a shave and a new wardrobe Barnes is quickly installed in the president's office, separated from Mussburger's own by the works of the massive company clock. It is at this point we meet the kindly clock keeper (Bill Cobbs) and the company repairman. They seem to represent good and evil forces in the film.Newspaper editor (John Mahoney) is suspicious of this move to put a novice at the helm of such a big company and dispatches prize-winning reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to find out what is going on. Approaching Barnes as a poor, unemployed girl from Muncie, Archer gets him to hire her as his secretary. At first she thinks him an imbecile, and writes her story like this causing the stock price to plummet just as Mussburger wants. She soon changes her mind, however, seeing him as a bright and good-hearted fellow who is just totally naive about company politics. They soon start to fall in love.Now that he is the president, Barnes decides to have the company produce his new product. Mussburger goes along with this as he expects it to be a bust further dropping the stock price. As it turns out Barnes's idea, when actually manufactured, is the hula-hoop which soon becomes a big success and pushes Hudsucker stock prices to new heights.Mussburger sets out to totally discredit Barnes by having elevator operator Buzz (Jim True-Frost) claim Barnes stole the hula-hoop idea from him. He also discovers that Archer is actually the reporter that wrote the story bad-mouthing Barnes and accuses him of bad judgment in hiring her. The apparent betrayal by Archer sends Barnes into an emotional tailspin and Mussbuger has psychiatrist Dr. Hugo Bronfenbrenner (David Byrd) declare him mentally incompetent.Archer finds Barnes at a beatnik bar on New Years Eve and tries to apologize to him, but he leaves intending to throw himself out the window of his office. He first puts on the apron he wore in the mailroom and then climbs out on the ledge. He finds he can't do it, but slips and falls anyway. Suddenly halfway to the ground he stops as the clock keeper has wedged a broom handle into the mechanism of the company clock apparently stopping time.While Barnes hangs in space, Waring Hudsucker visits him in the form of an angel. Waring reminds Barnes of the blue letter he never delivered which is still in his apron pocket. Barnes reads the letter which reveals that Waring, despite his apparent success, was never happy because he drove away the woman he really loved. The letter also goes on to state that the 51 percent of the shares owned by Waring will go to whoever the board selects as the next company president (who, at the time, Waring was sure would be Mussburger), so that person will be free to operate without the pressure from the stockholders. Barnes realizes this will save him, if only he can avoid falling the rest of the way to his death.Up in the clock room a fight starts between the good clock keeper and the evil repairman. The broom is knocked out of the mechanism and Barnes starts falling again. A punch from the clock keeper, however, sends the repairman's false teeth flying into the mechanism to stop the clock again with Barnes only two feet above the ground. When it starts again he is uninjured by the short fall and races to the bar to tell Archer that he loves her.Barnes is again in charge of the company and Mussburger, finding out that he could have had everything he wanted - the presidency and the stock - if he only hadn't been greedy, goes off the deep end and is sent off to a sanitarium. With Archer as his girl at the next board meeting Barnes introduces his next big idea for Hudsucker Industries, the Frisbee. The board applauds and the film ends."

Fugui and Jiazhen endure tumultuous events in China as their personal fortunes move from wealthy landownership to peasantry. Addicted to gambling, Fugui loses everything. In the years that follow he is pressed into both the nationalist and communist armies, while Jiazhen is forced into menial work. They raise a family and survive, managing ""to live"" from the 40's to the 70's in this epic, but personal, story of life through an amazing period.—docraven The story begins some time in the 1940s. Xu Fugui (Ge You) is a local rich man's son and compulsive gambler, who loses his family property to a man named Long'er. His behaviour also causes his long-suffering wife Jiazhen (Gong Li) to leave him, along with their daughter, Fengxia and their unborn son, Youqing.After he loses his entire family fortune, Fugui eventually reunites with his wife and children, but is forced to start a shadow puppet troupe with a partner named Chunsheng to support his family. The Chinese Civil War is occurring at the time, and both Fugui and Chunsheng are forcibly enlisted into the Kuomintang during a performance. After a heavy battle, Fugui and Chunsheng are captured by the forces of the Communist Party of China, where they quickly become entertainers for the troops. Eventually Fugui is able to return home and finds out that Fengxia has become dumb and lost most of her hearing due to a fever.After the CCP's victory, Fugui attends a local public trial where the new communist authority convicts Long'er of sabotaging the revolution. Long'er recognises Fugui, and tries to break free from the executioners, but he is brought back and shot. It turns out that Long'er did not want to donate any of his wealth to the ""people's government"", and when they tried to pressure him to do so, they only enraged him further so that he decided to burn all of his property instead of giving it away. No one helped to extinguish the fire due to Long'er's bad reputation, and he was designated a reactionary.The story moves forward a decade into the future, to the time of the Great Leap Forward. The local town chief enlists Fugui and Jiazhen to donate all scrap iron in their possession to the national drive to produce steel and make weaponry for invading Taiwan. As an entertainer, Fugui performs for the entire town, which has been devoted entirely to producing steel. Later, the district head, who turns out to be Chunsheng, inadvertently crushes and kills Youqing. At the gravesite of the boy, his mother leaves for him a lunchbox of 20 stale dumplings, which were intended as his lunch for school that day, plus 20 newly made dumplings. Chunsheng arrives at the grave, but his attempts to apologize and compensate the family are rebuffed.The story moves forward again another decade, to the Cultural Revolution. The village chief advises Fugui's family to burn their shadow puppet drama props, which have been deemed as counter-revolutionary as they are traditional cultural elements. Fengxia is now grown up. Her family arranges for her to meet Wan Erxi, a local leader of the Red Guards. They fall in love and marry.It is then revealed that Chunsheng, the district chief, has been branded a reactionary. He arrives late at night to inform Fugui and Jiazhen that his wife has committed suicide and he plans to do so also. Chunsheng wanted to give all of his money to Fugui's family as a form of his final apology and wished that they accept the money before his death. Jiazhen, who up to that point refused to talk to Chunsheng, tells him to keep living, because ""you still owe us a life!""During Fengxia's childbirth, her parents and husband accompany her to the county hospital, where they find out that nurses are in charge as all doctors have been sent to do hard labor for being ""reactionary academic authorities"". The nurses tell the family that both the child and mother will be fine, but the family is skeptical, and manages to retrieve a doctor from confinement to oversee the birth. As the doctor has not eaten for several days, Fugui purchases seven steamed buns (mantou) for him and the family decides to name the son Mantou, after the buns. However, Fengxia begins to hemorrhage, and the nurses panic, admitting that they do not know what to do. The family and nurses seek the advice of the doctor, but find that he has overeaten and is semiconscious. The family is helpless, and Fengxia dies from hypovolemia. The point is made that the doctor ate 7 buns, but that by drinking too much water at the same time, each bun expanded to the size of 7 buns: therefore Fengxia's death is a result of the doctor's having the equivalent of 49 buns in his belly. (1949 was the year that the Chinese Communist Party cemented its hold on modern China.)The movie ends several years later, with the family now consisting of Fugui, Jiazhen, their son-in-law Erxi, and grandson Mantou. The family visits the graves of Youqing and Fengxia, where Jiazhen, as per tradition, leaves dumplings for her son. Erxi buys a box full of young chicks for his son, which they decide to keep in the chest formerly used for the shadow puppet props. When Mantou inquires how long it will take for the chicks to grow up, Fugui's response is a more tempered version of something he said earlier in the film, which shows that he no longer possesses the blind faith in communism he once had. However, in spite of all of his personal hardships, he expresses optimism for his grandson's future, and the film ends with his statement, ""and life will get better and better"" as the whole family sits down to eat."

The Leprechaun describes the girl he has chosen to O'Day, but when O'Day sees that the girl is in fact his daughter, he intervenes with ""God bless you, my child"" therefore denying the Leprechaun his bride, as the creature can marry any girl who sneezes three times, provided no-one says ""God bless you."" The Leprechaun captures, tortures and tells O'Day that he will marry his descendant in a thousand years time on St Patrick's Day, before he kills O'Day, whose corpse is then discovered by his daughter.In present day Los Angeles, the Leprechaun has found a petulant sixteen-year-old girl named Bridget Callum, a descendant of the O'Day bloodline, who is fighting with her boyfriend, Cody Ingalls.

The Leprechaun steals some whiskey and a gold tooth from a homeless man and a gold ring off the finger of Tim Street, a talent agent, who believes that the little man is some kind of performer.

The Leprechaun appears and Morty challenges him to a drinking contest in honor of his wedding. While the Leprechaun downs whiskey, Morty is actually drinking soda and water. The Leprechaun eventually becomes extremely drunk, so much to the point he can barely speak properly or use his magic. He distracts Morty and Cody by turning on a jukebox with his powers, leading him to bash Morty in the head with a bottle to get away.He goes to a coffee shop, where he sobers up, and takes the time to murder a waiter (Michael McDonald) who was making jokes about his size and speech. Meanwhile, Cody and Morty break into the go-kart racetrack that Ian worked at since the office contains a huge safe on wheels made of wrought iron, the only thing that can harm the Leprechaun. Cody traps the Leprechaun inside, but Morty takes advantage of the opportunity to claim three wishes and locks Cody in a store room. His first is for the Leprechaun's pot of gold, which the creature causes to appear in Morty's stomach, grotesquely stretching it. Morty wishes for the Leprechaun out of the safe so that he can help him, and, for his third wish, asks for the pot of gold out of him. The Leprechaun cuts Morty's stomach open and pulls out the pot, killing Morty. Morty begs for help as he dies, but the Leprechaun laughingly says ""love to, friend, but you're all out of wishes.""Just then, as Cody breaks out of the store room, a security guard, who has responded to a silent alarm that Morty tripped, enters. The Leprechaun disappears, setting Cody up to take the fall for the brutal murder. Before he can arrest Cody, however, the officer is lured onto the track by the Leprechaun's impersonation of Bridget and is run over twice and killed by the little green man in his own custom go-kart. He attempts to kill Cody for his gold coin, but Cody realizes that as long as he holds it, the Leprechaun cannot harm him, leading him to run to the Leprechaun's lair to attempt rescuing Bridget.In the Leprechaun's tree lair, Cody runs into the skeletal corpse of William O'Day. After a hard and victorious battle, he finds Bridget, who breaks free from her shackles, and they both flee, but get hopelessly lost and separated. Cody then runs back into Bridget, who kisses him and says that it's okay to give her the coin. Cody does so, but finds out that Bridget is actually the Leprechaun, who laughs and says 'you lose' in his normal voice. Before he can claim victory, though, Cody proceeds to impale the Leprechaun with a wrought iron bar, revealing that the coin he handed over was the chocolate coin he received earlier, causing the little man to explode.Bridget and Cody head out of the Leprechaun's lair into the sunlight together. She asks how he knew that it wasn't really her. Cody replies, ""He kisses differently than you."" as they laugh and walk home."

Set in urban Auckland (New Zealand) this movie tells the story of the Heke family. Jake Heke is a violent man who beats his wife frequently when drunk, and yet obviously loves both her and his family. The movie follows a period of several weeks in the family's life showing Jake's frequent outburst of violence and the effect that this has on his family. The youngest son is in trouble with the police and may be put into a foster home while the elder son is about to join a street gang. Jake's daughter has her own serious problems which are a key element in the plot.—Chris Maslin <maslinc@cad.canterbury.ac.nz> A family descended from Maori warriors is bedevilled by a violent father (Morrison) and the societal problems of being treated as outcasts. This 1994 drama opened the eyes of audiences world-wide to the reality of life for a small section of New Zealand, broke domestic box office records, and was followed by the 1999 sequel What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?. This film is about a Maori family living in Auckland, New Zealand. The parents, Beth and Jake Heke, moved to the city when their tribal elders disapproved of their relationship. Beth (Rena Owen) was descended from the tribal leadership, and seems to have been next in line for leadership when she ran away. Unfortunately Jake (Temuera Morrison) was descended from people who were considered slaves (captives of inter-tribal wars). Rather than be separated they ran away, moved to the city, and got married. They have five children.The film opens with Jake coming home with gifts for his wife and family. He then reveals that he has just been laid off and his wife, Beth, is less than pleased. The viewer almost feels sympathy for Jake at this point. He seems like a man who wants his family to be happy. The truth turns out to be different.Jake has a horrible temper, especially when he drinks. He gets angry easily, and after consuming alcohol he becomes extremely violent. Often after a night of drinking at the bar, Jake takes the party home where dozens of intoxicated people flood their home and drink into the early morning. They sing and carry on, even though the children are upstairs trying to sleep. Beth joins in with the drinking and it becomes quickly apparent that they both have a problem. Beth and Jake are very hospitable to their friends, feeding them and allowing them to spend the night. It affects their home life, especially since Jake is unemployed and has 5 children to feed. The children often do not have any food to eat the next day. Jake also savagely beats Beth when he is drunk, which seems to be often. While the physical violence seems to be mostly directed at Beth, it has obviously affected the children as well.The eldest son Nig (Julian Arahanga), is angry and rebellious. He soon joins a gang who sport traditional Maori facial tattoos and think of themselves as warriors. However they seem to have forgotten the honor of traditional Maori warriors, and are really just a gang of violent thugs. It is telling that Nig would rather be with them than his own family.The next oldest son, Mark nicknamed Boogie (Taungaroa Emile), is constantly arrested for breaking the law and has to go to court for his most recent incident. Beth misses her son's court date because of how badly her husband Jake beat her up the night before. The court determines that Boogie's parents are not capable of supervising him, and they send him to a boys group home. While Boogie initially resists being in the boys home, the program director is a strong man who inspires Boogie to look for his own inner strength and teaches him the old ways of the tribe, including their traditional chants and martial art: Mau rakau.The oldest daughter, 13 year old Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), has taken on a maternal role in the family. After her parents drunken parties she gets up and cleans up all the empty bottles and gets her two younger siblings ready for school. She even accompanies her brother Boogie to his court date. Her best friend Toot (Shannon Williams) is homeless and lives across town in a car. She goes to him for comfort and escape from her family's violent home. She loves him (platonically) and visits him often to read him stories she has written in her journal.Back at home, nothing has changed and the nightly loud drunken parties still continue. One night, one of Jake's best friends, Bully (Cliff Curtis) sneaks into Grace's room and rapes her. He threatens her not to tell anyone. Traumatized about what happened and not knowing who she can turn to, she closes up inside, even pushes away Toot. When her father disciplines her for not being respectful to Bully, she hangs herself in the backyard.Beth knows that the violence in the family caused Grace to kill herself but she does not know about the rape. Devastated, she takes Grace back to her tribe to be buried traditionally. The funeral brings all of the kids back together in unity and in Grace's memory. After the funeral, Beth reads Grace's journal and finds out that Jake's friend raped Grace. Outraged, she goes to the bar to confront Jake and the Bully. Jake doesn't believe Beth until she shows him the journal. Jake becomes enraged and beats Bully to death.The movie ends with Beth leaving Jake for good, but unfortunately that will not bring Grace back. Beth closes the movie with the words ""Our people once were warriors. But unlike you, Jake, they were people with mana (power), pride; people with spirit. If my spirit can survive living with you for eighteen years, then I can survive anything."""

Five bittersweet vignettes that span the entire human history about five different men, all called Hector and played by the same actor (Robin Williams), who find themselves at a critical juncture in their lives. In prehistoric times, Hector lives in peace with his wife and their little son and daughter in a cave on a quite uninhabited island somewhere in the north. His world is shattered when a group of foreign pagan raiders led by a young chieftain and a somewhat pacifistic priest arrive there. In Ancient Rome, Hector is a loyal well-treated slave of Lucinnius, a somewhat naive big trader with political connections. When his latest shipment fails to arrive and the local corrupt governor Cyprion refuses to lend him money for his further endeavors due to bad omen that a professional soothsayer saw while reading the future from a chicken liver, he is ruined. To make things worse, just as Hector plans to ask his master for freedom and elope with his master's female African slave Thalia, Lucinnius informs him that they've been chosen to be scapegoats and must kill themselves under the governor's orders. In medieval times, Hector is a Scotsman who's traveling with a somewhat zealotic but friendly and well-intentioned priest on a mission of mercy to help the fallen crusaders, mortally wounded in the bloody skirmishes, make it to the other side in peace. Beatrice, a nice beautiful flirtatious Italian widow, is traveling part of the way with them as well. Hector is tired of death and carnage and wants to go home but when he and Beatrice connect despite not speaking each-others languages, he falls for her. The priest warns him that he can't handle her needs but Hector doesn't take his friendly warning seriously and eventually leaves with her. However, he soon realizes that the priest was referring to responsibilities of a complicated family life. During the Renaissance, a group of Portuguese nobleman and their servants and soldiers gets shipwrecked somewhere on the coast of Africa.

Then Hector borrows the flower delivery car from his nice girlfriend Anna to get the kids but forgets to deliver the flowers which Anna's client ordered for a celebration. His kids don't make things much easier for him either. He decides to treat them like adults for a change and they have a redeeming serious talk about their uneasy relationship.

Three Colors: White,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111507/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After his wife divorces him, a Polish immigrant plots to get even with her. In the second entry in Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, Polish immigrant Karol Karol (Zamachowski) finds himself out of a marriage, a job and a country when his French wife, Dominique (Delpy), divorces him after six months due to his impotence. Forced to leave France after losing the business they jointly owned, Karol enlists fellow Polish expatriate Mikolah (Gajos) to smuggle him back to their homeland. Karol (Polish) marries Dominique (French) and moves to Paris. The marriage breaks down and Dominique divorces Karol, forcing him into the life of a metro beggar and eventually back to Poland. However, he never forgets Dominique and while building a new life for himself in Warsaw he begins to plot.—Anonymous The destructive dynamics of a relationship based upon great inequality. Karol is a Polish hairdresser working in France. He has a beautiful wife, Dominique, whom he loves to obsession, and who is in the process of divorcing him for his inability to ""consummate the marriage"". Karol loses all of his earthly possessions and is literally driven out of France by his estranged wife. He then fights to resolve his deep passion for Dominique with his own helplessness.—Tilo Reber <treber@page.mmc.com> After opening with a brief, seemingly irrelevant scene of a suitcase on an airport carousel, the story quickly focuses on a Paris divorce court where Polish immigrant Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is pleading with the judge (the same legal proceedings that Juliette Binoche's character Julie briefly stumbled upon in the previous film 'Blue'). Despite his difficulty in understanding French, Karol is made to understand that his French wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) does not love him. The grounds for divorce are humiliating: Karol was unable to consummate the marriage. Along with his wife, he loses his means of support (a beauty salon they jointly owned), his legal residency in France, and the rest of his cash in a series of mishaps, and is soon a beggar living on the streets. He only retains a 2-franc coin that he got as change from the phone while trying to speak with his now ex-wife.In a Paris Métro station, performing songs for spare change, Karol meets and is befriended by another Pole, Mikoaj (Janusz Gajos). While Karol has lost his wife and his property, Mikoaj is married and successful, he offers Karol a job consisting of killing someone who wants to be dead but does not have enough courage to do it himself. Through a hazardous scheme, Mikoaj helps him return to Poland hidden in the suitcase shown at the beginning of the film, which is later stolen by employees at the airport. The airport thieves, eager to find something valuable inside their stolen trunk, are angry when they open it and they find Karol inside. The thieves beat up Karol and leave him behind in a nearby garbage dump.Despite his mishap, Karol returns to working as a hairdresser with his brother (Jerzy Stuhr) whom he now moves in with. After a while, Karol, no longer content to working at his brother's salon, quits his job and sets up to make himself a pot of cash in newly capitalist Poland. Karol takes another job as as a bodyguard in a seemingly innocent cash exchange office. Mikoaj meets Karol in a Warsaw Metro tunnel for the execution of the ""suicide"", it turns out to be that Mikoaj is the intended victim and asks Karol to kill him. Karol shoots a blank into Mikoaj's chest and asks him if he really wants to go through with it as the next bullet is real. Mikoaj refuses and is able to feel alive again. Using his position as a deceptively foolish bodyguard, Karol spies on his bosses and discovers their scheme to purchase different pieces of land that they knew were going to be targeted by big companies for development and resell for large profits. Karol beats them to it, and then tells his ex-bosses that if they kill him all his estate shall go to the Catholic Church, and they are therefore forced to purchase all the land from him. With the money he gained from this scheme and with the payment from Mikoaj, the two go into business (of a vaguely defined but possibly illegal nature) together.Karol becomes ruthlessly ambitious, focusing his energies on money-making schemes while learning to speak French and brooding over his wife's abandonment. He uses his new financial influence in a world where, as several characters observe, ""you can buy anything"" to execute a complex scheme to first win back Dominique, and then destroy her life.Karol takes his revenge against his ex-wife by faking his own death after which she shows up for his funeral. Karol then sneaks into her hotel room and has sex with her to prove his potency again. Then afterwords, Dominique is arrested and imprisoned for his 'murder'. The final image of the film shows Karol secretly visiting his wife in prison and staring at Dominique through the window of her prison cell. Karol then suddenly feels ashamed at himself for this revenge plot against his wife and openly cries... realizing that he must finally let go of her in order to move on with his own life."

When he is fired by Cale for killing a few corporate officers, he unleashes the ultimate killing machine called the 'Warbeast' against Cale and those who would help her.—Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com> In 2003, the controversial megacorporation Chaank Armaments is the world's leading manufacturer of cutting-edge weapons and military hardware.

Public outcry ensues following the incident, the majority of complaints directed at the company's new chief executive Hayden Cale.Chairman of the Board Scott Ridley, fearful of the potential termination of Chaank's contracts due to the bad publicity, tries to cover up the incident and numerous issues with Project: Hard Man itself. Cale demands immediate and full public disclosure, having purposely leaked a number of top-secret documents to the press in defiance of Ridley's attempts to suppress knowledge about his shadier activities. She also demands for Jack Dante, a deranged weapon designer and lead developer of Project: Hard Man, to be fired. Despite Carpenter's acknowledgement of the project's numerous fatal flaws, the board simply ignores Cale's requests, no one seeming to care about her interests except for Dante himself. Cale is warned by a junior executive about Dante's unstable behavior and the fate of Nicholson, her late predecessor. Cale goes to confront him, demanding to know about Dante's secret project in Vault 10, for which he never submits progress reports on. Far from cooperative, he instead threatens Cale. Dante blackmails her with detailed knowledge of Cale's living situation, place of residence, and personal information. Cale asks Ridley for help, but he refuses while telling her that Nicholson took a similar interest in Dante's work. However, he was killed in a mysterious accident believed to have been an animal mauling. During their confrontation, Cale manages to lift Ridley's access card so she can investigate on her own. Dante learns that Cale has the card and confronts Ridley, subsequently killing him with a mysterious weapon.Meanwhile, a trio of eco-warriors (Raimi, Weyland, and Yutani) infiltrate the Chaank headquarters in order to destroy its digitally-stored assets and send the company into bankruptcy. Carpenter calls Cale after finding Ridley's mutilated corpse which had an implanted life-sign transmitter. She investigates Ridley's death and discovers that whatever killed him came from Vault 10. Taking matters into her own hands, she terminates Dante's employment and seals the vault. Dante is about to shoot her when the eco-warriors show up and take everyone hostage. They demand access to the building's secure area in order to destroy the company's digital bonds, but Cale refuses to cooperate. Raimi goes to their alternate plan to cut through the bulkhead leading to the containment area. Dante, sensing his chance, ""helps"" them by suggesting they cut through one of the vaults surrounding the containment instead, suggesting they start at Vault 10.Once the vault is open, Dante jumps in and activates his invention called the Frontline Morale Destroyer (aka ""Warbeast""), which promptly kills Weyland. Raimi flees, meeting up with Yutani as well as the subdued Cale and Carpenter. Dante broadcasts his demands over the monitor system, demanding that his employment be reinstated and Cale to ""interface with him on a regular basis"".Raimi and Yutani cancel their operation in an attempt to escape from the building, along with Carpenter and Cale. Carpenter is killed by the Warbeast inside of a lift. Later on, Raimi, Yutani, and Cale manage to reach the top floor of the building, which holds classified items, whose existence even Cale is unaware of. Among the classified items are the primary components of Project: Hard Man, including advanced weaponry and armour. Raimi suits up and downloads the Hard Man data into his brain. Fighting off the Warbeast, he manages to slow it down enough to allow an escape via an outdoor service elevator.

Chungking Express,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two melancholy Hong Kong policemen fall in love: one with a mysterious female underworld figure, the other with a beautiful and ethereal waitress at a late-night restaurant he frequents. Wong Kar-Wai's movie about two love-struck cops is filmed in impressionistic splashes of motion and color. The first half deals with Cop 223, who has broken up with his girlfriend of five years. He purchases a tin of pineapples with an expiration date of May 1 each day for a month. By the end of that time, he feels that he will either be rejoined with his love or that it too will have expired forever. The second half shows Cop 663 dealing with his breakup with his flight attendant girlfriend. He talks to his apartment furnishings until he meets a new girl at a local lunch counter.—Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> Two individual stories of lovelorn Hong Kong police officers are told against the backdrop of the bustling but often lonely concrete jungle that is the city, the two stories loosely tied by the same western fast food stall in the Chungking Mansions they routinely frequent. In the first story, He Qiwu, badge number 223, is a plainclothes officer. On April 1, 1994, May, his girlfriend of five years, breaks up with him. He goes through a daily ritual to deal with the news, he hoping the break up is a joke seeing as to the day she tells him. That ritual will end on May 1 - his twenty-fifth birthday - which if she does not return to him by then, he will come to the conclusion that it is not a joke and try to move on without her. The day of his birthday is altered not by May's return, but by his encounter with an Asian woman wearing a trench coat and a blond wig, to who he is instantly attracted, not knowing that she has had a difficult day in her ""job"" as a drug smuggler. In the second story, Officer 663, a beat cop, has routinely ordered a chef salad at the stall for his girlfriend, a flight attendant he met on a flight she was working. After they embarked on a relationship, he thought she would be the one. However, she breaking up with him coincides with a young woman, the owner's cousin, starting her temporary employment at the stall, she who has a penchant for listening toThe Mamas and the Papas' ""California Dreamin'"" very loudly. As she and the others working at the stall quietly follow 663 dealing with the break-up, 663 may be too distraught to notice that she might like to take the flight attendant's place in his life, she who is able to insinuate herself in his life in ways he may not fully comprehend. She takes the tact that she does as being in the same position he is with the flight attendant.—Huggo Having broken up with his girlfriend, to ease the pain, the lonely, lovelorn police officer, He Qiwu, consumes thirty cans of pineapple in remembrance of her birthday and bygone, once-happy times. In contrast, a mysterious woman hiding behind a pair of dark sunglasses, wearing a blonde wig and an anorak, yearns for closure. Then, by a twist of fate, the two perfect strangers will cross paths, eager to share their loneliness for a while. Elsewhere in the bustling city, gloomy, recently dumped Officer 663 has a chance encounter with quirky Faye, a new girl working at a local lunch counter, obsessed withThe Mamas and the Papas' song, California Dreamin'. Now, urban alienation, love, loss, unbreakable life patterns, and faded memories define the existence of four city dwellers. Can their parallel courses intersect?—Nick Riganas Two stories, two lovelorn cops, two objects of desire: one a big-time heroin dealer in deep trouble with her boss after the cargo disappears, the other a seriously flaky take-out waitress who inadvertently gets hold of the keys to her admirer's apartment, all shot in a breathless kaleidoscope of color and hand-held camera work to create a mesmerizing portrait of Hong Kong in the 1990s.—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> The movie comprises two different stories, told one after the other, each about a romance involving a policeman. Aside for a brief moment when the first story ends and the second begins, the two stories do not interconnect. However, the three main characters from the second story each momentarily appear during the first.First storyThe first story concerns Taiwan-born cop He Qiwu, also known as Cop 223 (played by Kaneshiro). Qiwu's girlfriend May broke up with him on April 1 (April Fool's Day). His birthday is May 1 and he chooses to wait for May for a month before moving on. Every day he buys a tin of pineapple with an expiration date of May 1. By the end of this time, he feels that he will either be rejoined with his love or that it will have expired forever. Meanwhile, a woman in a blonde wig (played by Brigitte Lin) tries to survive in the drug underworld after a smuggling operation goes sour. On May 1, Qiwu, looking for romance, approaches the woman in the blonde wig at a bar (the Bottoms Up Club). However, she is exhausted and falls asleep in a hotel room, leaving him to watch movies alone. She leaves in the morning and shoots the drug baron (played by Thom Baker) who had set her up. Qiwu goes jogging and receives a message from her on his pager wishing him a happy birthday. He then visits his usual snack food store where he collides with a new staff member, Faye. At this point, a new story begins.Second storyIn the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 (played by Tony Leung) is similarly dealing with a breakup, this time from a flight attendant (Valerie Chow). He meets Faye, the new girl at the snack bar (played by Faye Wong). She falls for him in secret, and frequently breaks into his apartment during the day to redecorate and ""improve"" his living situation. Gradually, her ploys help Cop 663 to cheer up, and he eventually realises that Faye likes him and arranges a date at the restaurant 'California'. However, Faye stands him up after a last-minute decision to see the world before settling down; she leaves him a fake boarding pass with a date a year from now. In the last scene, Faye arrives back in Hong Kong, now a flight attendant; she finds that Cop 663 has bought the snack bar and is converting it into a restaurant. Their future however always remains ambivalent."

receives a ""psychic fax"" from Nadja, telling him that she is injured and

As the chairman/fall guy, they pick a former political prisoner who turns out to be more than meets the eye. Two Italian racketeers come to Albania just after the fall of the communists to set up a fictive firm and pocket the grants. They need a stooge. They choose an old one in a jail : Spiro. But the youngest italian, Gino, once alone with Spiro, encounter a few problems. Far from his roots, loosing his identity in deep Albania, he begins to change...—Yepok This movie depicts a lesson of history before, during and after Mussolini, a transition between socialism and communism, poverty and early technology in the humanity's timeline. It's a beautiful compilation of both worlds, Italy and Albania, on social conditions, promise of a better future, business partnership, adaptation to a new world. Characters speak either Italian or Albanian or both. Spiro Tozaj, the Albanian name of a dual character, is a political prisoner - a true Italian World War II prisoner who admits he deserted to be with his family - lost track of time and events of the world. In his mind, he still has a boy, Giovanni, of 3-4 years old, and a wife, Rosa. In reality, about 50 years have elapsed. Originally from Sicily, he ended up in an Albanian prison and eventually, a home for elderly people. The racketeers are erroneously recruiting him thinking he's an honest Albanian with no relatives, the perfect candidate for business, giving hope to local Albanians for an honest business of a shoes company, Alba Calzature, a money laundering business. While Gino, the Paisa' (short for 'paisano', peasant, as Spiro calls him) starts an adventure on Albanian territory trying to bring the old man to Italy, he learns that his true name is Michele Tallaricoof, a Sicilian. Personal trouble comes upon both when they separate, the old man almost losing his life in an incident where children almost asphyxiated him with smoke. As he's trying to move on towards Italy, other incidents along the way make the characters grow, communicate and discover true introspection into what life really is. Roles shift onto making the old man become the wise one who finally speaks and gives words of wisdom to the young ones. Trouble comes Gino's way when the business falls apart and he ends up in a jail himself. His precious freedom is negotiated for the head of a corrupt Albanian, Dr Kruja - Mr Croce - and his eventual departure to America brings Gino new endeavors, hopes, dreams and introspection into his own solitude. God made both Catholics meet again on the ship to America where they realize they need each other the most.—I. Dunklin"

Bandit Queen,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109206/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of the bandit queen Phoolan Devi who was sent to prison in 1983 and got free in 1994. The movie tells the story of the bandit queen Phoolan Devi who was sent to prison in 1983 and got free in 1994. For five years she was prosecuted by the Indian police and turned into a legend (like a modern Robin Hood) by the Indian press. Although the press tended to make her the optimal hero with blue eyes, dark hair, being tall and beautiful she was in reality an average Indian which makes it hard for the movie to fulfill the expectations of the audience and tell the truth at the same time. Later in her life, she entered into politics and was assassinated in 2001.—Volker Boehm In Bhind in 1968, Phoolan is married to a twenty-something fellow called Puttilal (Aditya Shrivastava). Though child marriages are customary during that time, Phoolan's mother Moola (Savitri Raekwar) objects to the timing of the match. Phoolan's aging father Devideen (Ram Charan Nirmalker) conforming to his culture, regrettably disagrees, and Phoolan is sent off with Puttilal.Phoolan is exposed to some sexual and exploitative abuses, including the caste system. (Phoolan's family as well as Puttilal's family belong to the lower ranked Mallah sub caste; the higher ranked Thakur caste takes the lead in social and political situations.) Puttilal is physically and sexually abusive, and Phoolan eventually runs away and returns home. As Phoolan grows older, she faces incidents of (non-consensual) fondling and groping from the Thakur men (whose parents make up the Panchayat or village government). At the next town meeting, the Panchayat wield their patriarchal authority to banish Phoolan from the village, since she will not consent to the sexual advances of the higher caste males, who treat her like sub-human chattel.Accordingly, Phoolan (Seema Biswas) leaves with her cousin Kailash (Saurabh Shukla). En route to another village, she encounters a troop of Dakus (bandits) of the Babu Gujjar gang, led by Vikram Mallah Mastana (Nirmal Pandey). Phoolan stays with Kailash for a while, but is eventually compelled to leave. Angry and hopeless, Phoolan goes to the local cops (to try to have her ban lifted), but she is beaten, molested, and arrested by the cops, who sexually assault her while in custody. The Thakurs put up bail and have her released. But, unknown to her, the bail is a bribe (paid, through the cops, to Babu Gujjar's gang), and Babu Gujjar arrives to collect his prize.In May 1979, Phoolan is abducted by Babu Gujjar (Anirudh Agarwal). Gujjar is a ruthless, imposing mercenary. Although Gujjar's lieutenant Vikram is sympathetic towards Phoolan, Gujjar indiscriminately brutalizes and humiliates her, until one day Vikram catches him sexually assault her (yet again) and shoots him in the head. Vikram takes over the gang, and his empathy for Phoolan eventually grows into a mutually respectful mature adult relationship. Around this time, Phoolan revisits her former husband Puttilal, and with Vikram's help, abducts him and exacts her justice for his sexual assault and abuse, beating him up. She shares her closure with Vikram.All goes well until Thakur Shri Ram (Govind Namdeo) is released from prison. Thakur Shri Ram is the real gang leader (boss of the erstwhile Gujjar). Shri Ram returns to his gang and while Vikram receives him with respect, Shri Ram bristles at Vikram's egalitarian leadership style and covets Phoolan. In August 1980, Shri Ram arranges to have Vikram assassinated, and abducts Phoolan, bringing her to the village of Behmai. Phoolan is repeatedly sexually assaulted and beaten by Shri Ram and by the rest of the gang members, as punishment for her ""disrespect"" for his previous advances, and for her audacity at being an equal. The stunning and disturbing final humiliation and punishment is that she is stripped, paraded around Behmai, beaten and sent to fetch water from the well (in full view of the village).A severely traumatized Phoolan returns to her cousin Kailash. She recovers gradually, and seeks out Man Singh (Manoj Bajpai), an old friend of Vikram Mallah. Man Singh brings her to another large gang, led by Baba Mustakim (Rajesh Vivek). She relates her history to Baba and asks him for some men and weapons to form a gang. Baba Mustakim agrees, and Man Singh and Phoolan become the leaders for the new gang.Phoolan leads her new gang with courage, generosity, humility and shrewdness. Her stockpile and her legend grows. She becomes known as Phoolan Devi, the bandit queen. In February 1981, Baba Mustakim informs her of a large wedding in Behmai, with Thakur Shri Ram in attendance. As Phoolan departs, Baba Mustakim warns her to remain low key. Phoolan attacks the wedding party and her gang exacts revenge from the entire Thakur clan of Behmai. They round up the men and beat them up. Many of the men are finally shot. This act of vengeance brings her to the attention of the national law enforcement authorities (in New Delhi). The top police officials now begin a massive manhunt for Phoolan, and Thakur Shri Ram relishes the opportunity to come to their aid.The manhunt claims many lives in Phoolan's gang. They are ultimately forced to hide out in the rugged ravines of Chambal without any food or water. Phoolan evaluates her options and decides to surrender. Her terms are to have her remaining mates protected and provided for (the women and children in particular). The film ends with Phoolan's surrender in February 1983. The end credits indicate that all the charges against her were withdrawn (including the charges of murder at Behmai), and that she was released in 1994."

Dreaming of infiltrating into the globe's top-notch security systems for world domination, the rampant Russian Mafia boss, Konstantine Konali, has made a fortune promoting his best-selling computer game. In despair, Commandant Rakov calls in Commandant Eric Lassard to lend a hand in stopping the megalomaniac, and before long, the experienced team ofPolice Academy (1984)flies to cold Moscow, a few years after their success inPolice Academy 6: City Under Siege (1989).

Can Lassard's veterans pull off a surprise victory in their challenging mission to Moscow?—Nick Riganas The Russians need help in dealing with the Mafia and so they seek help with the veterans of the academy. They head off to Moscow, in order to find evidence against Konstantine Konali, who marketed a computer game that everyone in the world is playing. With a sequel to the game he wants to put back doors in all computer systems on which it gets installed, thus providing access to the police and other government systems.—Thomas Meyer <i03a@zfn.uni-bremen.de> Russian mafia boss Konstantine Konali (Ron Perlman) is laundering money under the guise of a legitimate business. A highly addictive video game (which has already generated $1.5 Bn in revenues) that allows him to bring down almost any security system controlled by a computer on which the game has been played, with a string of major robberies as the result.Desperate to apprehend Konali, Russian Commandant Alexandrei Nikolaivich Rakov (Christopher Lee) sends for help from America. On orders from Boris Yeltsin (Alexander Skorokhod), President of Russia, Rakov decides to bring in someone he met at a police convention, Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes).
Lt. Yuri Talinsky (Gregg Berger) is the head of the Organized crime unit in Moscow police.Lassard briefs his team about the mission in Russia, then they head to Moscow. Along with Lassard in Moscow are Sergeant Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), Sergeant Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Captain Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Cadet Kyle Connors (Charlie Schlatter) (who gets on the team by accessing a police data base file listing the personnel for the mission and removing a fellow cadet to add his own name. Connors has vertigo) (Connors tries to tell Lassard the truth, but Lassard brushes him aside and welcomes him on the team), and Captain Thaddeus Harris (G. W. Bailey).Rakov appoints Katrina Sergeeva (Claire Forlani) as their translator and Connors has the hots for her. At the airport, Lassard gets into a hearse, rather then escort organized by Yuri and is lost. Yuri is afraid of losing his job and has a Lassard lookalike bellboy (Vladimir Dolinsky) to take his place, teaches him a little English and asks him never to venture out of the hotel room.
Rakov briefs the team that Konali operates out of his restaurant, his home and his warehouse (the HQ of his video games business).As they plan to capture Konali, he has devised a new scheme: to create an even more addictive version of the game (which has a Trojan horse virus embedded in its programming), which can bring down any computer security system in the world (the virus will be able to bypass any security system worldwide , giving Konali access to banks, stock markets, intelligence everything), including the systems that protect the databases which belong to world powers.
Irina Petrovskaya (Allyn Ann McLerie) is a forensics expert who can tell everything about a person just from a strand of hair.
The team figures that Yuri is stalling them, so they take Katrina's help to investigate themselves. They visit the sites that Konali extorts. They visit his saunas (which is a front to fence stolen jewels). Harris bugs Konali's restaurant and learns that he is putting a contract on Lassard's entire team for interfering with his business.An assassination attempt is made at Gorky Park, but fails due to the crowd. Katrina takes Connor to the Zemskov circus. Katrina and Connor get close to each other. Then they visit the casino, where Konali hangs out at night.
Debbie seduces Konali at the casino and Connor manages to get close to Konali and gets hired as a goon in his entourage. Connor meets Adam Sharp (Richard Israel), who is Konali's programmer developing the Trojan horse. He learns that Konali keeps the computer key (the password) at his office at the restaurant. Tackleberry and Jones infiltrate the office, but pick up his physical keys (not understanding that Connor meant a computer password)Meanwhile Adam has finished developing the Trojan for Konali and Konali prepares to release it. Jones receives a message to be at the Ballet theatre as Konali is expected to buy some stolen weapons. Harris overhears the message and infiltrates the theatre as a ballet dancer, as he doesn't have a ticket to get through the front door. Lassard's men arrest Konali after he passes a check to a next seat audience, but it turns out to be some sort of a donation check for a kids organization.. Konali is released, as Connor realizes that they have been set up.
The next day Konali abducts Debbie as he is besotted with her. Connors notices this and the entire team gives chase. But Debbie is put into Konali's bedroom, where he tries to rape her. Just then he gets news that his program is in the police computers and Konali uses his password to get in (which Debbie sees). Konali leaves for his warehouse, before Lassard's men attack and rescue Debbie.
They find that Konali is about to ship millions of copies of his game (with the Trojan embedded in it). Lassard's men intercept Konali at the warehouse and present Yuri with the evidence, but Konali escapes again by giving the slip to Harris.Konali runs to his restaurant where Lassard is having dinner with his new Russian family. Konali recognizes Lassard and engages him a sword fight, where Lassard defeats Konali and arrests him."

A two character movie, involving a college professor, John, who is confronted by a female student, Carol, who is failing his course. The two spend a long time talking to each other, during which time John says a few things that can be taken the wrong way. After the night the two spent talking, John is slapped with a sexual harassment accusation by Carol. After more accusations from Carol, John's career as a teacher begins to fall apart.

Despite doing everything he tells her and the other students to do in class including reading the book he wrote, she just doesn't understand much of the terminology and thus cannot grasp the concepts. John, conversely, is preoccupied to think much about Carol, he imminently going to meet his wife to deal with some issues regarding the house they are in the process of buying - his and Carol's meeting continually interrupted by telephone calls about the house - and as he is in the final steps to being granted tenure. As their meeting progresses, its tone changes to being more personal in many respects, including John, in seeing Carol's distress about her imminent failing grade in light of being a bright student, suggesting dropping many of the traditional constructs of schooling including ""knowledge"" yardsticks in already giving her an A if they routinely have one-on-one meetings just to discuss the concepts, and as he tells anecdotes of his own personal life to illustrate what he is trying to convey to her. Two subsequent meetings between the two are then shown, both on his request. The first is after he learns that she has filed charges against him with the tenure committee of inappropriate behavior stemming not only from that encounter but it in conjunction with things he does and says in class, he hoping to clear the matter with her outside of the official channels of the tenure committee. And the second and final subsequent meeting is following the results of the tenure committee's investigation into the matter, during that meeting when John learns the full extent of Carol's accusations and what she and the group she now represents want from him.—Huggo"

From then on, and for the next 28 years, Konrad and Sophie will attempt to meet again, in spite of the Iron Curtain. Konrad, who has become a reputed Astrophysicist, tries to take advantage of scientific congresses outside Eastern Germany to arrange encounters with Sophie. But in a country where the political police, the Stasi, monitors the moves of all suspicious people (such as Konrad's sister Barbara and her husband Harald), preserving one's privacy, ideals and self-respect becomes an exhausting fight, even as the Eastern block begins its long process of disintegration.—Eduardo Casais <eduardo.casais@research.nokia.com> In August 1961 the world was already divided, but no one ever dreamt of the long border reaching its full height. Moscow had the copyright for the concept and execution, and German firms delivered the barbed wire. An unjust regime has committed a new injustice, the west protested, threatened, and lamented, but the wall grew. All the arteries between the two halves of the city were served. To the people on both sides, separated by a few hundred meters between East & West became the longest strip of land in the world. So began the strangest experiments in history. A people who once made enough to rule the world became two. Soon the only the wall supported the illusion: All that divide Germany was a Wall.The open sequence of the film follows a group of friends Konrad, Sophie, Max; Wolfgang, and Monika have all devised a way to cross the Berlin Wall without detection. The group maneuvers the sewer systems armed with the clothes on their back, a flashlight, and a map etched on the palm of their hand. The group must work under cover of darkness, all in mist of rotating patrols monitoring the wall. In act of urgency the group makes their way to the strategic sewer entrance to make the journey of smelly lower Germany. As Sophie, Max, Wolfgang, and Monika make their decent into the sewer Konrad is forced to seal the entrance because of approaching army patrols. Sophie would not go without Konard, but he assures her that he make the journey at a later date. Sophie and the rest of the group press on with their objectives of reaching the other side of the wall. On the surface Konrad is confronted by his parents who were out surveying the streets, fearing that he might have picked up from one of the circling patrols for trying escape over wall. Father and son embrace and is than rebuked for failure to tell his parents where he had gone, or what he was planning to do. In the fathers anger, he informs the authorities that his son as been found after searching for him through out most of night. Meanwhile Sophie and her cohorts navigate their way through waste infested sewers of Germany. Many are found covering their noises with scarfs with little resistance to the smell. After some considerable time the group finally makes it to her aunts house. Sophie and her and embrace, after not hearing from one another for days. Sophie reassures her and that despite traveling through the sewers of Germany they all made it out okay. When Sophie begins to inquire about Conrad Sophie informs her that he will be joining the group at a later date.We next see Konrad seated motionless while a police is going the details of his capture. His conclusion is that the maximum for boarder crossing has a maximum penalty of five years. Thus an interrogation ensues where the inspector begins to explain that you no matter how hard he tried he, and all his friends would be caught. He then begins to tell Konrad insight Sophie, Max, Wolfgang and Monika have all been captured and detained by the government. Next he inquires about whom in the group had the drawing for the sewer system? Throughout the entire interrogation Konrad has not said a single word. His only gesture in the entire scene comes when he told tie his one shoelace on his left shoe. The inspector proceeds to tell Konrad how he must feel at that exact moment in time, similar to a caged animal wanting to be set free. The interrogator than tells him the true nature of why boarders were erected, to prevented East and West Germany could stop from shooting one another. He than acknowledges his disappointed that he had to attempt to cross borders, like so many others, and it was a shame he nor his comrades could be convinced of a lager understanding of why the wall was ever erected in the first place.We now enter the apartment of Konrad and his parents. Konrad and his sister have grown anxious to know weather Sophie, Max. Wolfgang, and Monika were successful in their attempt to make it across boarders while avoiding all detection. Several hours have passed since Konrad saw Sophie, Max, Wolfgang, and Monika since the night of their escape. Konrad is found pleading his sister to contact the parents to ensure Sophie did make it across the boarder safely. Simone calmly assures Konrad that if the family had gotten a phone call, such an outcome would have confirmed the group might have been captured. This is the one scenario Konrad fears the most without a phone contact Konrad has no confirmation that Sophie is even alive and if might not see her ever again. Simone then lifts the head of her brother and makes him a promise that Sophie would contact him very soon, and the Wall not last long.In this next scene we are exposed to a fashion we Sophie has been made in charge of helping models dress for a small fashion show for a small group of designers and clients alike. The fashion is much sophisticated then your average shopper of the day. Sophie has made herself at home with her aunt who has giving her something to smile about. In the middle of the fashion show, the stepfather of Sophie has paid a visit the aunt on suspicion that Sophie might have made it across and is staying with her and hiding out. Since the wall was erected, any civilians trying to jump over the wall without proper documentation will be reprehend and sent back or are shot. Sophie aunt reassures her stepfather that she came over for her desire to work in the industry, and so that is way she gave the chance to come and work for her as an assistant. The Stepfather only reason for his coming is so he and Sophie might have a chance to talk. Once alone in Sophie makes it clear that she has no desire to go back with him. After her father committed suicide in prison Sophie was sent to live with him. Given the tension in the scene, in is made clear their relationship with one another is rocky at best. The stepfather only wants her to go back with him because it is unlawful for any German citizen to be any portion of East and West Berlin without proper documentation.	Following this there is a brief encounter between German investigators and the mother of Sophie. After an ongoing investigation into her sudden disappearance, authorities have come to inform her that Sophie has crossed boarder lines illegally, and by doing so, she has now declared herself as part of the enemy. Her mother remains committed to the understanding that all she wanted to do was visit her aunt and return home in just a few days time. The police affirm that because she chose to cross any part of the boarder without official authorization, she has now declared herself an enemy of Germany. Her mother is now being ordered to severe all contact between herself and Sophie. If she were to continue having correspondences with Sophie, she would also constitute herself as a member of the enemy.Sophie and her Aunt are each revisiting old photos of when Sophie was just a little girl. Both of them have made the same distinction that in every picture the two of them ever took together, they always could see the two of them always holding hands. Sophie then makes the point that when she was a child, and even to the present day, her aunt said Sophie would always be her Aunt special little girl. In this same setting Sophie make another for her to pin a letter to her expressing her love for her. The Aunt said, should would if she could. With all prestige and money she ever made. Sophie was the one her Aunt loved most. This scene is followed by a short sequence of Sophie swinging back and forth on a swing set hug from a tree as her aunt looks on through the living room of the house. Konrad standing still in contemplation about what he will be doing with life until he knows his beloved Sophie is back in his arms forever. Following this Konrad pivots around and finds himself staring at an arching bridge with a passing train.We next hear the shouting of orders of what to do if any civilian try and jump over the wall. The German Army has established border patrol units to monitor the wall around the clock. This is the first of its kind, and to the Germans is the most humane way to police and cut down on then number of people making attempts to hurdle the wall. Those who do not choose to follow these new regulations are considered a member of the enemy. The scene is a small band of patrol officers running through the drill of Stop, do not move or I will shoot! The solider is than to run an stab the escapee with his basinet in both the right and left lung. Konrad is one of the men required to take part in this drill. As the drill makes his way down the first line of boys, he comes to a boy, as it is his to simulate the drill. The boy can only muster the words, stop dont move. This only irritates the drill instructor and reminds him, he is a solder. The orders are, find capture and destroy. When the boy is told to carry on, he boy can only say stop, dont move1 The instructor then approaches him and says, Are you against Peace? Fall out! With a single act, a feeling is placed within the heart of Konard, the strongest example for change is silent disobedience.This is follow by a span of the wall. The wall is out fitted with guards stationed all along the wall acting as surveillance for the patrols down below. Next we see and hear a series of two pre-recorded forms of propaganda media transmitted on two moving trucks with megaphones one side of the wall is calling for the end of the wall and the oppression of the German people. On the flipside of all that there is opposition propaganda calling for the reform of East Germany, there is only one group of Germany that will survive such a war, and those are those members of the socialist party. Solders layer all of this radio propaganda up above the wall, and those on the ground monitoring checkpoints of those approaching the wall and than waving to family members across the wall. The soldier maintains a watchful eye one the slightest gesture could initiate a possible attempt to hurdle the wall. Patrol guards understand that if its see the actions of its laws taking affect, the chances of one, or large number of civilians hurdling the wall is greatly reduced by having such measures in place. Konrad knows in his mind and heart that he be given a chance to be re-united with his beloved Sophie one day very soon.We next enter the Konrad dinning room during a family meal. The subject has turned to the topic of why Konrad was put on the border to serve out his probation for him choosing not to participate in the drill exercise that was talked earlier. The family seems a bit on edge because of why Konrad was assigned to border patrol in the first place. The family discussion becomes heated as everyone professes their own opinion as to why the family has become so argumentative since every sibling in the Konrad household has been affected in by the presence of the wall, in one way or another.We come to a moment now where Konrad has been asked to work the night shift. In the silence of the night Konrad tries to make a run for it over the wall without detection. He know that is as good of an opportunity he might ever get. Through his binoculars he surveys the distance from the guard shack to the wall. He then turns and calls for his partner Ouve, who is sleeping on his watch. After a second of calling his name, Konrad quietly as possible begins his slow descent from the guard tower to the base of the tower. Check the observation window a final time he makes his way towards the wall. When the end is in sight Konrad recognizes a familiar command Stop, or I will shoot! as Konrad turns both he and his partner are a bit confused on what to make of the events that had just transpired. Ovue, is bound to know why Konrad was running from the guard shack. Konrad reported he something moved towards the wall to investigate. Ouve then responded that he would have report Konrad for regulation practices. Konrad was also quick to remind Ovue, that he should be reported for sleep on his watch. That is an offense also worthy of investigating.We now sift to Sophie and her comrades who are all gathered around the television listen to the lasts reports on those attempts that have tried and failed. The news report advised its listening audience to exercise caution when contemplating a boarder crossing. The Report also makes a strong emphasis against building tunnels for the simple fact that no matter how well constructed they may appear to be, it would only take a moment to have it all come cashing down. The final comment the report did make was, there would come a day, where there be no wall.Next is a scene of reuniting of Max, Sophie, and Wolfgang and Monika. Max has made it a job of providing worthy patrons safe passage across the border while avoiding detection. Word has reached Max about the relationship between her and responsibility of maintaining his position as a boarder patrol officer would a bit more for anyone to handle. Max inquires of Sophie, what if Konrad would not want to come back? Sophie just knew that he Konrad would just about anything to see Sophie in his arms again.
We next meet Konrad at the train station surveying the trains as they pull into the station. We then see a man in black leather scanning a photograph of Konrad and Sophie, at which point, the man strategically walks past Konrad as to not make anything suspicious. The two men exit the station together headed two the street. The conversation was brief instruction on the plan is to follow through. There is no turning back now. If Konrad sticks to the plan, Konrad would be reunited with his beloved Sophie in no time. Later that same afternoon as Konrad was exiting a railway car. Konrd becomes a first hand witness to a pubic abduction of women by two men and shoved into the back seat of an unmarked car that was following a second lead car. The cause of the cause for the kidnapping and the two unmarked vehicle is yet to be determined.We next meet up with Sophie who is working a fashion show when Wolfgang has come to inform her about the groups latest attempt to crossing proved to be a failure, as only the first five members of group made passage safely. When Sophie asked if Konrad had made it as one of the first five, his only response was, he was lucky that he never showed up. Sophie simply did not want to belief what she had been told. She had to put this all behind here, as she was in the middle of a fashion show. It was not until after the show that Sophie found a couch, for now, she was convinced that Konrad had really been captured. There is also fear within Sophie might never be able see ever again. The next scene is simply acts as a continuation of the pervious one. The only difference this time it is Konrad who is found out sobbing for witnessing the kidnapping of that girl and no being able to do anything to stop it for fear that his true identity is discovered and might be the one who is forced to slave around for amusement of everyone else.We now transition to the summer of 1968, where Konrad has been sent to work for the Astronomy institute in Potsdam under the tutelage of the ability to do research and build a resume of credits to his name without have to have fear of his true identity being discovered. During all his years in the observatory. Konrad also changed his first name to conceal his connection within any and all ties with the people of Germany. Over his tenor there, he had learned to establish a theory and build such a machine that could demonstrate the practical application of Herr Richter Dynamo theory and has been in asked to give a lecture at the IAU Conservatory in Prague. The lecture would to explain the appearance of sunspots. Before leaving for Prague Konrad meets up his Barbra and her friend to share his excitement about going to Prague for the first. His trip will not just be about business, it will also to surprise Sophie with a letter in a sealed envelope with the goal being to ask her to marry him.Once in Prague According to the letter that are to meet in front of the statue with three statues. After some time has passed Sophie asked a store clerk where the specific statues were located. As it turned out the statue of three was really a statue of four. It didnt long after that to find one another after that, because when they did, their embrace was a firm as it ever was. It simply became a joy to be together again at last.

Nightwatch,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110631/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A law student starts working as a night watchman at The Department of Forensic Medicine in Copenhagen. His mad friend gets him on a game of dare that escalates. As a serial-killer's victims start piling up at work, he becomes a suspect. In order to finance his law studies, Martin starts as a night watchman in a mortuary. When the victims of a serial killer of prostitutes are deposited there, scary things begin to happen. Therefore and because of a strange bet with his fellow student Jens, the police begins to think he is the murderer. Police detective Wormer wants to help him but Martin is more and more suspected.—Joern Richts <richts@informatik.rwth-aachen.de> A young law student, Martin (Waldau), takes a job as night-watchman at the local morgue. It seems a good idea as he needs the money, the quiet will be great for studying and the current watchman is retiring. Before he leaves, the watchman shows Martin his duties, one of which is checking on the morgue itself. This seems pretty creepy, especially when the old man won't tell him why he is leaving, but Martin is young and eager. That evening, after leaving his girlfriend, he returns with his radio. As everyone leaves the building silence descends -- the slightest noise makes him jump, the rattle of moths stuck in the lamp seems almost welcoming. Walking the corridors we can feel his apprehension at entering the morgue, being among the eternally silent corpses. Everything is fine, of course, but it's a strange job.Martin's friend Jens (Bodnia) doesn't seem to mind, but then he's a fairly unusual person. During a boring lecture they fall into a game of dare, where the stakes are that the loser marries his girlfriend. Later on, in a bar, their girlfriends are hassled by some fascist thugs, although they choose to look the other way and stay conscious. Martin then challenges Jens to argue with them, which he does -- deftly insulting them before running away. In return Martin is set up with a prostitute, Joyce (Rikke Loise Andersson), whom Jens knows. Before meeting her Martin works some more nights at the morgue, one of which is disrupted when the latest victim of the local serial killer is brought in. Through talking to the detective (Ulf Pilgaard) on the case of this psycho-killer Martin sees the victim, horribly mutilated through scalping. The circle of characters is completed when Martin meets Joyce, who was a friend of the murdered prostitute.As time passes in the morgue strange things happen, pushing Martin into doubting his own sanity. It seems that evidence is mounting up which proves that Martin is the serial-killer when corpses are found disturbed (shades of necrophilia). The tension builds higher and higher, to an almost painful level, as Martin walks through darkened hallways with the killer seemingly only one step behind. Everybody seems a possible suspect, both to Martin and to us. The final, extremely bloody, slaying only seems to seal his fate.The grim and macabre feel of this story seeps through the screen with shots of dim rooms, lit by flickering fluorescent lights, and low-key acting. Although there are some holes in the plot, and it is probably possible to work out the ending early on (if you wish to), this doesn't detract from the incredible level of suspense. It feels as though your whole rib cage will explode under the pressure as we see the serial killer carry out his deadly plan, with a high level of intelligence and cunning. The supporting performances are quite reasonable and add substance to the film, as a welcome contrast to the psychological cat-and-mouse game being played out. Although some of the scenes are extremely disturbing (think: 'Se7en,') they do add to the total impact.Overall, this is a film worth seeing but be prepared to stop breathing for minutes at a time."

Pom Poko,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110008/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A community of magical shape-shifting raccoon dogs struggle to prevent their forest home from being destroyed by urban development. As the human city development encroaches on the raccoon dog population's forest and meadow habitat, the raccoon dogs find themselves faced with the very real possibility of extinction. In response, the raccoon dogs engage in a desperate struggle to stop the construction and preserve their home.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> Tokyo needs space to expand and that means less and less room is available for nature. The Tanukis, a special kind of metamorphosing raccoon, suffer the consequences. There is nowhere to go and more and more territorial fights happen. The old Oroku understands something needs to happen. For once the Tanukis unite and decide on a five year plan. The goal: to sabotage the building projects and scare mankind away. But that isn't easy. To do so the Tanukis need to improve their metamorphic ability to transform into anything. Almost every Tanuki can do it, but it hardly isn't practiced anymore. While Oroku trains the Tanukis, Gonta, a fearsome warrior, isn't so happy. He is shocked by the amount of forest that is gone already and demands immediate action. He wants war.—Arnoud Tiele (imdb@tiele.nl) In the Tama Hills region near Tokyo, several groups of tanuki find their living arrangements under threat as humans begin tearing down the forested areas for residential developments.As food and living areas dwindle, some of the tanuki take sides and attempt to battle each other for dominance, before an elder named Oroku calls for a truce.The tanuki then gather at an old temple in the forest, and make it their main headquarters. A group of elders then devise a five-year plan, with several goals. One of them is to revive the lost art of transformation, another is to study the humans who are invading their habitat, and the third is to invite the ""transformation masters"" that are said to live on Shikoku and Sado islands, to help them better their skills and hopefully find a way to stop the current developments. However, none of the elder tanuki in the group volunteer for the third goal, so it is put on hold until the younger tanuki are of age to fulfill it.To learn more about the humans, the tanuki acquire a television set, and place it in the temple. However, the television soon ends up distracting them and causing some to become even more lazy than usual.Training is then conducted by Oroku and Tsurugame. Of the numerous young tanuki, one named Shokichi takes to his training quite well. While some tanuki excel at transformation, there are some who are unable to master the art, or unable to fully transform into a proper human.Once winter ends and a new spring begins, the tanuki work hard to fend off their urges to mate, as an increase in their population size will lead to problems. This also gives the female tanuki a chance to excel at transformation studies. It is also noted that both male and female genders can properly transform into their same gender in human form, but a male-to-female and vice-versa transformation yields improper results.Tsurugame also clues in the male tanuki that their testicular ""pouches"" can also be utilized in transformative skills.A number of Tanuki are also sent out into the nearby city disguised as humans, followed by instructors. The amount of energy to make these transformations can wear out a tanuki, and they must rely on energy drinks at times to keep up their strength. To fully pass the test, each of the trainees must obtain a job and earn at least 1,000 yen (aka $10 US) through physical labor.Things get intense when a tanuki named Gonta finds out his birthplace has been destroyed in the recent construction. Though the elders are against taking such drastic actions, Gonta, Shokichi, and a number of other tanuki fight back against the humans at the construction site. This eventually leads to the destruction of numerous vehicles, and the deaths of a number of human workers. The tanuki are at first overjoyed at the havoc they have caused, but then grow concerned when the television news claims that a need for more residential housing, will not slow the housing development plans.However, out of the recent events, the news media then airs a segment on how some superstitious humans feel that the recent accidents may be due to angered spirits who had religious shrines and shelters moved out of the area for the development. The tanuki use this, and take on the forms of religious idols and other spirits, frightening a number of humans who are in the area, and causing the news media to report on these strange happenings. Even with all the talk of these sightings however, construction still continues.Following these events, the elders hold a contest to decide which two tanuki will be sent off to find ""the transformation masters,"" as part of their third goal of their five-year plan. The final decisions send one tanuki named Tamasaburo to Shikoku island, and one named Bunta to Sado Island.One day, Shokichi and Oroku come across a tanuki from the Kanga Prefecture. He explains that a number of trucks are dumping dirt into their rivers, and he stowed away on one of the trucks to figure out where the dirt was coming from. The knowledge that the current construction is affecting animals in other parts of the country, gives Shokichi and the elders more incentive to try and halt what is happening in their area.Winter comes, and with it the construction is put on hold. However, the ruckus the tanuki caused is soon forgotten by the news media.When SprIng comes, unlike the previous year, a number of young tanuki are unable to stop themselves from giving into the urge to mate. This urge even affects Shokichi, who soon has four cubs with a female tanuki named Hanako.As the seasons move into Summer and Autumn, the Tama Hills tanuki face severe problems. The birth of so many cubs and a lack of good weather has led to a severe food shortage, causing some tanuki to take on human form and scavenge through the nearby city for leftovers. However, it is hardly enough to sustain their rising population. The need for food soon sends some tanuki out into the night to scavenge from the surrounding areas. Unfortunately, some end up getting hit by cars, or caught in animal traps.The current situation brings back Gonta's push to declare war on the humans, but his plan will not be considered by the elders.Hope comes when Tamasaburo returns from Shikoku Island with three ""transformation masters"": Gyobu, Hage, and Kincho. The three masters then work with the tanuki, planning to put on a massive spectacle that they feel will cause the humans to stop the development in the area for good.After intense training through the masters, ""Operation Spectre"" sends the Tanuki through the nearby New Tama development, enchanting some, and frightening others as all manner of spirits and strange things are seen! Some humans even attempt to videotape the events, but find that their cameras have recorded nothing! The event makes the local news, and the tanuki celebrate seeing the numerous humans, unable to comprehend what they have witnessed.Unfortunately, due to his exertions in channeling energy for the spectacle, master Gyobu perishes.The day after ""Operation Spectre,"" the tanuki's spirits dip heavily when the President of a new theme park called Wonderland, takes credit for what happened, claiming it was all a publicity stunt for their park. This causes the tanuki to become depressed and incensed that their hard work seems to have added up to nothing.Soon after, master Kincho encounters a fox named Ryutaro, who has deduced that what happened was the tanuki's doing. Ryutaro has been in contact with the Wonderland President, and knowing the man has no idea how the spectacle was achieved, wants to make a deal with the tanuki, via Kincho.Taking the master to a suite in Tokyo (filled with fox girls transformed into humans), Ryutaro proposes that the tanuki come to work at the new theme park, and promises Kincho that they will be well-paid and cared for. Kincho however, is concerned for the tanuki that are unable to transform, and Ryutaro states that they will need to be left to fend for themselves, claiming that when he and numerous foxes adapted to the human world, they were forced to do the same with their own un-transformative kin.Back at the temple, the aftermath of the operation has disillusioned the Tama Hills elders, who struggle with what to do next. Gonta once again wishes to fight against the humans, while Shokichi wants to do another ""Operation: Spectre,"" only bigger than the last one. Tsurugame is also gravely upset that all their hard work was not acknowledged, and wants to expose the group to the media to draw attention to their plight, but Oroku feels the humans will just think it's another ""prank.""Shortly after the meeting, Kincho returns to the group with Ryutaro's proposal, which causes further fracturing within the group's leadership, as noone want to go along with his plan to work at Wonderland. Unknown to the others, Tsurugame sends a letter to a local television news show, signing it ""from the Tama Hills tanuki.""It is also found out that master Hage has gone senile, and has begun to recruit the non-transforming tanuki into a new religion of his own.Shortly after the meeting, Tamasaburo has a talk with master Kincho, declaring he wants to be the master's successor. They then devise a plan to get back at Ryutaro and the Wonderland President.Using their powers, they conjure up a giant cat statue structure for Ryutaro, the Wonderland President, and one of his men to deliver a down-payment on their services. Once inside, the three are ejected, and the tanuki make off with the money, giving the President a story no one will believe (his money was taken by shape-changing tanuki), and funds that the tanuki can use in future endeavors.Things continue to escalate as Gonta and a number of other tanuki have taken to terrifying the local populace, soon leading to a stand-off between Gonta's forces and the local police. In the end, the attack fails. In a last desperate move Gonta and his army transform into a tsurube-otoshi and block traffic. They get run over by a truck and suffer heavy casualties.Around this same time, the news station that received Tsurugame's letter has come to the forest, hoping to speak with the tanuki. After some coaxing, Tsurugame and Oroku appear, with the elder finally able to verbally state aloud that they were responsible for the recent spectral activity in the housing development. Oroku also makes a plea for their habitat, before she, Tsurugame, and several other tanuki transform on-camera, and disappear into the night.Following these events, master Hage and his ""cult"" of non-transforming tanuki decide to leave. Transforming his pouch into a great ship, they set sail down the nearby river, with the faint knowledge that when the old tanuki expires, the ship will disappear, and they will all drown.It is soon afterwards that Bunta returns from his quest to Sado Island, but claims that the master he was searching for was killed long ago. Seeing how much the landscape has changed in the years since he was gone, the tanuki is angered and upset at what has become of his home.It is at this point that the Tama Hills tanuki finally accept defeat, realizing they cannot stop what is happening. They then decide to channel their powers into one last spectral illusion, and on a bright early morning, turn the local cityscape, into what the world as it once looked many centuries ago.Following their final transformative event, the tanuki abandon the temple, which is soon torn down. However, the reveal through the local news did garner attention to the animal's plight. Humans began trying to find ways that the animals could co-exist with humans, and additional parks were built into the local development...but by then, the damage had been done.Just as Ryutaro and the foxes had done, those tanuki that could transform began to live amongst the humans. While some were able to adapt, some chose to do like their non-transformative brethren, and just live their lives as ordinary tanuki, surviving from day-to-day. Some tanuki, such as Seizaemon, went into real estate and sold off parts of the land.One evening, Shokichi is returning to his wife and children, when he sees some tanuki sprint through a hole in a wall. Going through it, he finds a golf course, and a number of non-transformative tanuki having a party. He recognizes his friend Ponkichi, and the two have a happy reunion, dancing amidst the small bit of greenery as Tokyo's massive urban sprawl surrounds what was once heavily-forested lands."

The Tall Man, that imposing menace from Morningside Mortuary, is back and once again haunting the thoughts of the now-adult Mike and his friend, ex-ice cream vendor Reggie. The two continue their hunt for the mysterious figure and in his path of destruction encounter a variety of dangerous situations, friends, and enemies. They also must contend with the resurrected dead plus a growing number of the infamous and deadly silver spheres which aid the Tall Man as he sets his sights on indoctrinating Mike and finishing the fight begun so many years ago.—Warlock <asstgpa@crimjust.ccjscarolina.edu> A new Tall Man arrives from another dimension, while Reggie is thrown off the hearse that is carrying Liz and Mike. The hearse explodes and Liz dies, but Reggie saves Mike from The Tall Man using a grenade and threatening to blow-up and kill everybody. When Mike recovers from the coma in the hospital a couple of years later, he is attacked by a Demon Nurse, but Reggie arrives. Soon The Tall Man kidnaps Mike and Reggie heads to the desert town Holtsville to hunt down The Tall Man and rescue Mike, but he is captured by three looters. However, the boy Tim saves him and the reluctant Reggie teams up with Tim. Now they head to Boulton to save Mike and destroy The Tall Man.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Immediately after his apparent demise at the end of Phantasm II, a new Tall Man emerges from the white room dimensional fork. During this time, the hearse driving Liz and Mike carries on and explodes. Reggie, who was attacked by the Alchemy/Tall Man creature, rushes over and finds Liz dead and a dwarf devouring her face. After killing a few dwarfs with his four-barrel shotgun, the Tall Man appears, apprehending Reggie and an unconscious Mike but leaves when Reggie threatens to detonate a grenade. Stating that he wants Mike in one piece, the Tall Man leaves with Liz's head in hand claiming to return for Mike when he's well again.After apparently spending two years comatose in a hospital, Mike has a near-death experience in which his brother Jody appears and tells him he's not ready to cross over into the light. Mike walks on but the Tall Man stands in his way, causing him to wake up. Just as Reggie arrives, Mike is attacked by a demon nurse but fights her off. A sphere emerges from her head and crashes out through the window. Back at home, Jody appears again to warn Mike but the Tall Man arrives via dimensional fork, fights off Reggie and Jody (now forcibly transformed into a charred flying sphere), and draws Mike through the gate with him.The next morning, Reggie (with the Jody-sphere) travels to the small town of Holtsville, which turns out to be deserted. Reggie is captured by three looters who lock him in his 'Cuda's trunk and drive on to another house. There they are attacked and killed by a little boy named Tim, who also releases Reggie.After they have buried three looters in the yard, Tim tells Reggie how the Tall Man took his parents and destroyed the town. In the morning, Reggie and Tim find the three graves empty and their pink hearse missing. Setting out to find the Tall Man, Reggie wants to leave Tim with a woman looking after orphans but the boy hides in the trunk and comes along.Reggie enters the Holtsville mausoleum and is confronted by a sphere. Before he can destroy it, he is assaulted and subdued by two young Black women, Tanesha and Rocky. Reg tries to warn them but the sphere kills Tanesha, as well as damaging Rocky's nunchaku. Tim appears and shoots it out of the air with his pistol. The three join forces and drive on, looking for a town called Boulton, which contains a large mortuary. On their way, they come across a convoy of hearses driven by gravers and follow them.As they camp outside, the Jody-sphere floats over to Reggie. In a dream, Jody appears and leads Reggie to the Tall Man's lair, where Mike is imprisoned in a small cell. The two free him but the Tall Man reappears and pursues the trio. Jody is transformed back into a sphere and Reggie awakes. Jody appears again, opens another gate, and Mike emerges. The Tall Man tries to emerge as well but Reggie manages to shut the gate just as he was about to reach through, cutting off the Tall Man's hands. They manage to fight off the small creatures that the hands morph into and also later the pink hearse containing the three comically-zombified looters.They reach Boulton mortuary, where they come across a cryonics facility which reminds Mike that the Tall Man dislikes cold. While Reggie, Rocky, and Tim are separately attacked by the looters, Mike consults with the Jody-sphere, who explains that the Tall Man is amassing an army to conquer dimensions. He also shows him in a dream what the Tall Man does with the dwarf creatures he has created from the dead: he removes the sapient part of the brain to create the spheres, turning the body into a drone and the mind into a killer. The Tall Man senses their presence before they can leave and paralyzes Mike. Surrounded by hundreds of spheres, the Tall Man reaches for Mike, who wakes up and finds himself strapped to the table. The Tall Man grabs and subdues the Jody-sphere and welcomes Mike. Soon after, two of the looters, Rufus and Henry, wheel in Tim. Mike tries to give a message to the boy, saying ""There are thousands of them"", but is paralyzed beyond speech by the Tall Man.Rocky meanwhile manages to shake off her attacker and goes on to fight off Reggie's. Cut free by the Jody-sphere, Tim runs into the remaining looters who are killed by the Jody-sphere and Reggie's four-barrel shotgun. The trio crash into the embalming room, where the Tall Man has begun operating on Mike. Rocky impales the Tall Man with a spear dipped in liquid nitrogen, causing his flesh to begin melting. Rocky and Reggie lock him in the refrigerator room. A golden sphere breaks out of his head, crashes outside, and chases through the corridors. Surprised by the golden sphere, Reggie catches it with a plunger and is almost overpowered by it. With help from Rocky and Tim, he submerges the sphere in the nitrogen tank, neutralizing it.In the meantime, Mike climbs from the table and sees yellow blood issuing from his wound. He looks into a mirror and sees a golden sphere in his own head, concealed by his torn skin. Just after the Tall Man's sphere has been dumped into the nitrogen, Mike appears, showing silver eyeballs, complaining of the cold and walking outside. Reggie chases after him but Mike warns him to stay away. Jody leaves as well, telling Reggie that they'll be in touch.Reggie suggests searching the mortuary but Rocky leaves, having had enough of dealing with the undead.

The Stöned Age,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111293/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Joe and Hubbs are a pair of rockers who are on a quest for 'chicks.' This is the tale of their adventures over one night. Determined to avoid another night of driving aimlessly around Torrance in the Blue Torpedo, Joe and Hubbs set out on a quest for fine chicks. Their paths soon cross with Tack, from whom they learn about a pair of radical chicks hanging out near the Frankie Avalon place. Over Joe's objections, Hubbs worms Tack out of the deal, and the pair take a slow ride toward their destiny.—Greg Helton <ghelton@airmail.net> In the opening scene, ""Crump's brother"" is hitchhiking on a busy highway. After a few cars pass him by, Crump's brother recognizes and yells at a long-haired teen in an old Ford pickup who screeches to a stop to pick him up. Crump's brother is obviously a tough guy. He tells the driver about two girls he knows about in Torrance Beach that he's planning to spend the night with. Later that day at Petro Park, a hangout in Orange County, the driver of the pickup tells some other dudes (known as ""the guzzlers""), about the two girls. Tack, one of the guzzlers, walks away from the others, obviously on some sort of mission. We can only wonder what he's up to as the opening credits roll.During the title sequence we meet Joe (Michael Kopelow) and Hubbs (Bradford Tatum), two typical long-haired teens who are bombing around in their 1960s Volkswagen Type II Squareback, The ""Blue Torpedo"". They're looking to party, but there isn't much going on. As if to emphasize the point, Joe's 8-track copy of ""Hocus Pocus"" by Focus is eaten by the tape deck. He then puts on ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" by Blue Öyster Cult, but Hubbs calls it a ""pussy song"" and orders him to take it out. Joe counters by saying: ""If it's B.O.C. how can it be pussy?"", but Hubbs doesn't want to hear it, and grabs Joe in a headlock until he complies.They make a stop to chat up the homely ""Buffalo Chicks"" and get the lowdown on the evening's parties. Then, cruising once again, they pass Tack, (played by Clifton Collins Jr. in one of his first film roles), who's trying to flag them down. Joe, at the urging of Hubbs, spits a loogey on Tack as Tack yells out ""I got some chicks, man!"". Hubbs shouts: ""Tack's got some chicks?"" and screeches to a halt to find out more. After failing to get Tack to reveal what he knows about the chicks, they reluctantly let him into the car. That's when Tack reveals that he has a ""shitload of fine chicks"" staying near ""that Frankie Avalon place"" down in Torrance Beach. Since Torrance Beach is some distance away, they then argue about money and gas. Hubbs yells: ""Information without transportation equals dick! If it weren't for us you'd still be sitting in the road jerking off!"" He then punches Tack and gets him to give up his weekend beer money.After stopping for gas and cigarettes, Hubbs and Joe talk to Crump, the gas station attendant. Crump tells them about two ""radical chicks"" his brother has down in Torrance Beach near ""that Frankie Avalon place."" He then tells them that it's a closed party because there are only two chicks there. Hubbs, knowing now that Tack lied, tells Crump that a babe named Desiree Gibson, whom Crump's brother likes, is doing ""amateur night"" at Dirty Dougs', a strip club down the coast, hoping to divert both Crumps away from the chicks in Torrance Beach.Hubbs then gets back into the Blue Torpedo and tells Tack to get out and wash the windows. Tack argues, saying he bought the gas, but Hubbs is adamant: ""If I'm gonna haul your ass down there I'm gonna need clean windows."" Tack gives in, gets out, and heads off to get a squeegee. But Joe hops in the car and they zoom off, ditching Tack. Knowing he's been duped, Tack chases after them and grabs onto the open window, begging Joe and Hubbs not to worm him out of the deal. But Hubbs punches Tack in the face and sends him sprawling across the parking lot as the Blue Torpedo squeals around the corner and out of sight.Soon, Hubbs and Joe arrive at a house in Torrance Beach and spy a sexy silhouette in a second-floor window. When they knock on the door, they meet the very sexy Lanie (Renee Ammann). Lanie grills them on drugs (they have none) and won't let them in unless they come back with a bottle of 151. So Hubbs and Joe head off to Liquor World, manage to sneak a bottle of 151 past the crazy disco clerk (played in a star cameo by Taylor Negron), Officer Dean and his partner, two inept Barney Fife-ish cops, and head back to Lanie's place to party.Across town, Tack needs another ride, and calls up Norm ""Snot-rag"" Hankey. But Snot-rag wants to watch his favorite TV show, The Dukes of Hazzard(!). But Tack replies: ""You wanna watch the fuckin' 'Dukes of Hazzard instead of getting laid?? I'm comin' over, man!"" So Tack shows up at the Hankey household and soon convinces Mrs. Hankey to let her son go cruising with Tack. Tack drives, screeching out of the driveway in a hurry to catch up with Joe and Hubbs.Meanwhile, Joe and Hubbs have returned to Lanie's house only to be met by the owner's daughter, Jill (played by China Kantner, who has a cute, slightly husky voice she may have inherited from her mom). If they are disappointed by her average looks, she is equally unimpressed by them (""You guys must be looking for the homeless sponge-bath party. It's two doors down""). But the bottle of 151 gains them entrance to the house. After drinking and listening to some rock music with Lanie and Jill, Joe mentions that Lanie looks ""just like that chick from the Virgin Killer album""). They then discuss concerts, and Joe talks about being hit by a laser at a Blue Öyster Cult show and seeing a ""huge gnarly eyeball"" staring right at him. The girls look at Joe with concern, and Hubbs berates him later for being such a space case (""You're blowin' it, dude!"").The girls take a quick bathroom break, and Lanie tells Jill she thinks Hubbs looks like Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple, and tries to get Jill to go for Joe, an idea Jill immediately laughs off. Meanwhile, Joe and Hubbs are busy urinating in the ice cube tray and raiding her dad's kitchen for snacks. Soon, there's a knock on Jill's door; as Tack and Snot-rag arrive. After a brief struggle for dominance, Tack reveals that there's a party in Palos Verdes. When the girls look intrigued, Hubbs protests, saying: ""C'mon, you don't wanna party with a bunch of Palos Verdes rich kids, do you?."" But of course, they do.So next we see the group being driven in Hanky's Camaro by Tack, wildly. When they arrive in P.V., Muldoon, the rich-boy host (played by Jake Busey), lets the girls in to the party but slams the door on the guys. Disappointed, they skulk around back and find the Petro Park Guzzlers drinking from kegs in Muldoon's back yard with the Buffalo Chicks. Joe, frustrated that he lost his chance to party, looks for a way in, but gets flipped off by Muldoon.Then, Joe gets a break. From the patio, he witnesses Lanie slap Muldoon across the face. When she comes outside, she asks Joe: ""What does someone have to do to get some drugs in this city?"" That's when Joe reveals that he has some marjiuana back in the Torpedo. Lanie, excited at the prospect, is ready to book right then, but Joe, ever the nice guy, is wary about ditching his buddy Hubbs. However, when Lanie offers to show him her new bikini, it's an offer he can't refuse, and soon they're getting high in Jill's neighbor's pool. Meanwhile, Hubbs, pissed that he can't find Joe or Lanie, flees the scene angrily with Jill, just as the party is about to be broken up by Officer Dean and the LAPD.Soon Lanie realizes Joe's stash is nothing but ""skank weed"", and she's pissed. Worse, all of a sudden Hubbs arrives, grabs Joe in a headlock and warns him not to ditch him again. Joe is forced to watch Hubbs make out with Lanie, but he gets jealous and starts tossing furniture into the pool. When Hubbs and Lanie join in the infectious fun, the homeowner hears them and comes out of the house carrying a baseball bat. Luckily for Joe he swings wide, falling into the pool and allowing the three to make a break for it. They arrive home out of breath and laughing. Joe follows Lanie upstairs where he finally makes his move on her, but she effortlessly drops him to the floor, warning him to keep his hands off. Hubbs laughs at Joe, but later commends his actions.Meanwhile Tack and the Guzzlers, after a lecture by Officer Dean on teen drinking (and having their kegs confiscated), rally and decide to head to the chicks' house, after first stopping off at a liquor warehouse for supplies.Soon we see the carnage that follows Crumps brother's angry realization that he's been had at Dirty Doug's. He's off to find his chicks! Meanwhile, back in Torrance Beach, Hubbs has has scored with Lanie. At the same time Joe and Jill are arguing downstairs, and Jill stalks out and down to the beach. Joe catches up with her and they continue to talk, trying to make sense of their lives, which consist mostly of drinking, dating and getting stoned. Jill leaves Joe on the beach, where he sees the moon morph into a ""huge gnarly eyeball"".When they return to the house, they find Tack and the horny gang of Guzzlers chanting: ""alcohol!"" and marching with cases of Ox 45 (talls, of course) that they stole from a liquor warehouse. There's a confrontation at the front door, where Tack calls Jill a ""fuckin' fat-ass"" and the Guzzlers gang up on Joe when he tries to defend her honor. Grateful, Jill helps Joe back into the house after he subdues Tack, and they end up (maybe) getting high off of Joe's skank weed stash and listening to music while the Guzzlers camp out impatiently on the front porch and Hubbs makes hay with Lanie upstairs. After Jill heads off for a bathroom break, Joe gets nauseated from the Ox 45 and skank weed mix and ""horks"" under a chair cushion and passes out.When Joe comes to, he and Jill discuss Blue Öyster Cult and ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" being a pussy song. Just then, he's beckoned upstairs by Hubbs. Hubbs tells him that he lied to Lanie about Joe's bad luck, and Lanie has agreed to have sex with him! But when Joe enters the room, he finds Lanie sleeping (nude) on the bed. Watching her sleep, he thinks again about being hit by the laser at the Blue Öyster Cult show; daydreams about his life as a stoner; and envisions his eventual death as nothing but a stoner(all in an inspired tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey) that even Stanley Kubrick might have enjoyed! When Joe comes out of his reverie, he decides it's not right to take advantage of Lanie, so he heads back downstairs, only to find Hubbs making out with Jill on the couch. Joe, jealous once again, interrupts them. Hubbs says it was all Jill's doing (something she doesn't deny).Then the trio hears a commotion outside. Crump's brother has shown up, and he's pushing around the Petro Park Guzzlers and trying to get inside the house by angrily thrashing the door. Joe and Hubbs are able to hold him off for a while, but eventually they flee to the kitchen, resigned to getting beat up by Crump's brother. But just when it looks like he is about to get inside, the yelling stops. Outside, Jill's father Warren (played by David Groh) can be seen knocking out Crumps Brother, and everyone else!Hubbs and Joe are celebrating their good luck --too early as it turns out-- as Warren enters his home, demanding to know who they are. Hubbs flees, but Joe is caught! Warren tosses Joe down the stairs and calls the police. After hearing the typical grownup lecture about ""all that stinking heavy metal music"", Joe has finally had enough! He stands up for Jill, Lanie, and himself, then makes his escape just in time through a window that Hubbs breaks.As the duo sneaks away, they see Officer Dean and the LAPD arresting Tack, the Guzzlers, and Crumps Brother. As Joe and Hubbs make tracks, Jill stops Joe in the back yard and asks why he didn't ""go for"" her. He replies: ""I was working up to it!"" Not needing a second invitation, he kisses her and asks for her last name so he can look her up afterwards. But her name is unpronounceable, so we know they'll probably never meet again.Safely back in the Blue Torpedo, Hubbs calls Joe a pussy for not ""jumping on the grenade with Lanie when he had the chance."" But by now Joe is feeling envy and jealousy too, and hits Hubbs. Hubbs responds forcefully enough, but when Hubbs calls Jill a fat-ass, Joe has finally had enough. He grabs Hubbs in a headlock and tells him to take it back! Hubbs finally relents and Joe, relishing his new-found power, calmly shoves his favorite song, ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" back into the 8-track. Hubbs looks like he wants to say it's a pussy song again, but this time, he thinks better of it, and rides along in silence. Joe has won.As Joe drives away in the Blue Torpedo, he sees the ""huge gnarly eyeball"" following him in the rear view mirror. Then it flies away, as the strains of ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" swells the soundtrack into the closing credits (and a cameo of two Blue Oyster Cult members themselves!). We are then reassured (as if we had any doubts) that ""No Chicks Were Harmed In The Making Of This Film""."

Sloan has no choice but to enter into Po's tournament of champions, a savage battle where winner takes all - and to Sloan - that means everything!

He goes to Mexico to enter a championship martial art tournament held at Tong Po's fortress. The only way David can save his wife is to battle his way through the tournament, Po's henchmen and personal bodyguard (Thom Matthews - Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Return of the Living Dead 1 & 2) in a fight to the finish and finally put an end to Tong Po once and for all.—chris_stoddard_78 The camera pans along the outside of Sante Federal Penitentiary and into the cell of David Sloane (Sasha Mitchell). David is writing a letter to his wife, Vicky (Deborah Mansy), talking to her about how he was framed for a crime he didn't commit, at the hands of Tong Po. David begins talking about events that began when his brother Eric, a national kickboxing champion, went to Thailand to fight in bigger challenges. Flashbacks to scenes from the movieKickboxer (1989)show Eric arrogantly believing he can best any challenger until he fights Tong Po (then played byMichel Qissi), who cripples him with a brutal elbow to his spine as he is prone on the mat. David's letter then talks about his other brother, Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) training in Thailand to avenge Eric. Kurt defeated Tong Po and dishonored him. Tong Po ambushed both Kurt and Eric before they could leave Thailand and murdered them. Then, when he found out there was a third Sloan brother, he came to America to force David to fight him. (Scenes fromKickboxer 2: The Road Back (1991)highlight these flashbacks). After Tong Po burned down David's gym, killing a young boy, Sloane trained with the same elderly Thai who trained Kurt, and defeated Tong Po. David then met Vicky, and they married and opened a school, and life was good... until David was arrested and jailed. David's letter concludes by warning Vicky that he believes even this will not be enough to sate Tong Po's wrath-- David is sure that Vicky herself will be targeted. He is warning her to hide and run from Tong Po, so that she is safe.A car drives into a gated estate. Two men emerge, dragging along a captive woman wearing handcuffs. She is brought into the estate where one of her captors has her handcuffs removed. Immediately she lashes out against both men, killing one of them. Her attempted flight is halted as Tong Po enters the room. The captive woman is Vicky Sloan. She tries to fight Tong Po (now played byKamel Krifa), who easily wards off her attack and leaves her crumpled on the floor after a brutal knee to her stomach. Identifying himself to Vicky, Tong Po shoves her down onto a bed and brutally rapes her.Back at the penitentiary, David is told he has mail. He opens the letter and then sits on his chair back in his cell in disgust. The letter says simply, 'Don't worry-- I'm taking good care of her. Your old friend, Tong Po,' along with a photo of Vicky as Tong Po's captive.David fights another inmate in a yard fight, knocking him out. Officers break it up and put him in solitary. Later he is brought into a room to be spoken to by a visitor, who turns out to be a DEA agent named Casey (Nicholas Guest). David receives Casey coldly, and they briefly argue over the events leading up to David's imprisonment before David tells him that it's been two years that Vicky has been held captive by Tong Po... David believes she's probably dead. Casey is offering David a way out: Tong Po has been the most powerful drug lord in Mexico for five years now, operating out of a sprawling ranch-estate that is fortified as well as any fortress. The DEA can't get close enough to shut him down. But every year on the 'Day of the Dead,' Po invites top fighters from around the world to compete at his compound, and the winner is challenged to fight Tong Po himself, for a million dollars. The DEA plans to secrete David as a fighter in the tournament. Some of Tong Po's men are in the pentientiary and the DEA will use David having been in solitary to 'hide' him from them. The mission is dangerous because Tong Po might recognize David, even after so many years since their last encounter. David is cynical at being recruited and offered freedom only because the DEA needs him, but he's more than ready to settle the score with Tong Po once and for all, and free Vicky from captivity.As David walks out of the prison, a biker rides by, dropping a manila envelope. It contains a faked passport for David and instructions to go to a location where back-alley street fights are held. He needs to impress one of Tong Po's men in these fights to get invited to the tournament. David passes a woman doing Tai Chi exercises and has a memory of training Vicky in martial arts.David goes to where the fight is happening. Interrupting the fight, he takes on both participants and knocks them out. Brubaker (Nicholas Anthony) is impressed and gives David the invite to the tournament down in Calixico, Mexico, with a million dollar payday for the big winner. As David walks on, Brubaker makes the call to tell Tong Po's men about a new entrant named Jack Jones, and tells them, 'don't piss him off.'David gets a ride with a biker to a town five miles from the Mexican border. He goes into a rough redneck bar where some of the men are harrassing a short blonde woman named Megan Laurence (Michele Krasnoo). When she proves adept at fending them off, some of them get behind her and break bottles over her head to knock her out. David cleans house, knocking everyone into the middle of the next millennium. But Megan proves entirely ungrateful and cold to David for his assistance. She realizes that David is headed to Mexico for the tournament and gives him a word of advice: that when he meets her in battle, to assume they'd never met.David gets a ride down to Calixico and makes his way to Tong Po's compound. He is met there by the hostess, Darcy (Jill Pierce). She takes him to the area where fighters battle it out to qualify for the tournament. As he is 'registered' for the final qualifying matches, he sees Megan Laurence staring intently at him.David watches a qualifying fight that shows a tall man with a long ponytail and a short goatee named Thomas (Burton Richardson) as a fearsome, sadistic fighter. He is then selected for the next qualifying match, finding to his dismay that his opponent is Megan. David doesn't want to fight Megan, thinking she is in way too far over her head already. Megan rakes a vicious kick across his face that hardly fazes him except for briefly snapping his head to one side. Sighing, David easily dodges her next attack and puts her in a sleeper hold that knocks her out.David is given a guest room on the compound and promptly sneaks out, finding that he has an ally-- Lando Smith (Brad Thornton), the young brother of one of David's students, whose life was straightened out by David.David continues sneaking around, trying to get intel, while Lando tries to question Darcy, whose answers are elusive but show she's not without a heart. Lando finds out that Tong Po will probably make Megan Laurence into one of his sex captives-- and when these young women reach a certain age, their future is grim.The fighters that qualified for the tournament are regaled at an opening celebration. David stares coldly as Tong Po is introduced. Later, David and Lando are talking. Concerned at being recognized by Tong Po, David hopes to discreetly locate Vicky and sneak away with her. Finding the celebration not to his liking, David leaves to return to his room.Tong Po takes the microphone again to announce that he is allowing one of the disqualified fighters a second chance to prove worthy of the tournament. Guards usher Megan Laurence forth and Tong Po announces that any fighter who defeats her will receive a $25,000 bonus-- but if Megan wins that battle, she'll take the place of the fighter who lost to her. A number of fighters all rush at Megan, who fights them off. Lando comes to her defense, even challenging Tong Po himself and not backing down after all the guards aim their guns right at him point blank. Tong Po merely laughs Lando off and tells him to enjoy the rest of the celebration. Megan grudgingly thanks Lando, who leads her away to get her cleaned up. Darcy intently watches them walk away.Darcy later goes to Lando's room to seduce him, and she is stunned when he turns her away. She leaves angrily, suggesting that maybe he 'doesn't like girls' or else 'prefers underage tramps.'After having snuck through much of Tong Po's compound, David takes out some papers from the manila envelope he'd received outside the penitentiary, which include a blueprint of the compound. Later that evening, he again sneaks through the compound in dark clothes and a ski mask. He finds his way to where many women are held captive and forced to have sex with compound men, and with each other. He knocks out two guards and finds Vicky in a cell. But before he can rescue her, security alarms sound and he must elude converging security to make it back undetected to his room.The next morning everyone is gathered in the tournament area. Tong Po warns all the fighters that he knows that someone trespassed into private areas of the compound, and anyone caught doing so would face serious punishment. The competition begins, and a number of matches are shown.Guards bring Vicky breakfast. She tries to melee with them and it takes four of them to grapple and restrain her.More matches are shown. Thomas, Megan and Lando all win their matches. David manages to keep his back and profile to Tong Po throughout his match, and also defeats his opponent.After the first round is over, Lando and David talk. David says he knows where Vicky is being held, and needs to find a way in. Lando says he might know a way. He goes to hit on Darcy, who is still steaming mad over his rebuffing her the previous night. But deep down, she still lusts for Lando, and gives in to his advances. After they are done, Lando confides in Darcy that he's here to free a woman captive who's been in the compound two years. Darcy is afraid of being found out, but Lando plays on her compassion; despite her suggestions to the contrary, Lando knows that Darcy herself is a captive of Tong Po, and he'll probably dispose of her anyway for someone younger once she reaches a certain age. He offers to try and help rescue her as well if she trusts him.As Lando leaves Darcy's room, another man knocks on her door.David leaves Lando's room, thanking him for his help. There's a knock on Lando's door, and two men rush in and knock him out.Lando awakens tied to a chair in Tong Po's home in the compound. Tong Po confronts Lando, knowing he is a DEA agent. Tong Po tries to torture it out of him, rubbing salt into Lando's wounds, but Lando doesn't break. Finally Tong Po plays one last card-- he has Darcy brought in. She is bound and gagged, dirty and disheveled, and it looks like she's been sexually abused. Tong Po takes a small knife blade and makes several deep cuts in Darcy's flesh as she screams in agony through her gag. Lando finally admits to being DEA and Tong Po 'thanks' him by making one last deep stab into Darcy's breast.David goes to where women captives are held and finds the cells empty. He knows that Tong Po is on to him and the women have been moved in anticipation. He fights his way through several converging guards until he is ambushed and knocked out by Tong Po himself. Tong Po unmasks David and promptly recognizes him. Tong Po's torturing of Darcy broke Lando into revealing everything.Early the next morning. David, Lando and Darcy are tied to ceiling beams in a cell. Darcy is dead, hanging limply from the ropes binding her wrists. Lando tells David that he's a DEA agent and infiltrated the tournament as David's backup.The final tournament rounds are scheduled to begin. Tong Po tells the remaining fighters that unlike the previous rounds, these matches are to the death. Each fight ends only with the death of one opponent. Those who are too intimidated by these odds, must leave the compound immediately. But when a few of the contestants choose to take Tong Po up on the offer, he pulls a gun and kills them all.The final matches begin with competitors stepping up their game. Megan refuses to finish off her beaten opponent, and Tong Po laughs at her defiance. Bodies of slain opponents are dragged just to the outside edges of the fighting ring and left there. When only a few participants are left, Lando and David are brought in. Tong Po announces that five years ago, his wife Sian was killed in a fire resulting from a DEA raid. He holds David Sloan responsible for Sian's death. He announces that a half a million dollar bonus will go to whomever fights David. A gunman forces a handcuffed Vicky to her knees on a walkway overlooking the tournament area.Thomas grabs the opportunity to fight David, but David defeats Thomas and two other challengers. Getting frustrated, Tong Po orders Megan to fight David. Getting to her feet, Megan reveals what she now understands about the tournament: it's all a setup for wanton violence. Tong Po never intended to pay anyone or let any of the participants leave alive. She feels that Tong Po is afraid of fighting David himself. She, David, Lando, and the other fighters attack all the guards and take them out, except for Thomas, who fights on Tong Po's side. Lando knocks Thomas out as Tong Po enters the ring himself. He beats Lando savagely, and doesn't even look at Megan as she batters him about the chest and midsection with kicks. He only smiles when she lands several kicks to his face before knocking her off her feet.David and Tong Po lock eyes. David stalks him out into the area where the opening celebration was held. Tong Po holds Vicky in a chokehold. David coldly tells him that killing Vicky will not bring back Tong Po's honor, but only shame him forever. Seething with malice, Tong Po acknowledges the truth of David's words and releases Vicky. David wades into battle with Tong Po, becoming more vicious every minute until he is beating Tong Po nearly within an inch of his life. Tong Po's right hand man finally interrupts the battle by threatening Vicky with a gun. David steps away from Tong Po, who scuttles away like a scalded dog.David stalks toward the right-hand man, discreetly picking up a long knife. Hurling it from behind his back, he kills the right hand man.The remaining fighters make their way out of the compound, Megan helping Lando as they meet up with David and Vicky. The camera pans away from the compound into the skies as we fade to black."

Ernest Goes to School,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109739/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jim Varney's recurring dim-bulb character Ernest P. Worrell returns in this film as a school maintenance man seeking to obtain a high school diploma. Ernest P. Worrell (Jim Varney) works as a janitor at Chickasaw Falls High School, which is facing closure due to the school board's decision to merge other schools in the area. There is also a new rule: All employees are required to have a high school diploma, which Ernest lacks due to an incomplete high school transcript.Ernest has two choices as a result: Resign or go through the twelfth grade. Ernest reluctantly decides to redo school and enters the student body, attending regular classes and performing usual student activities, but all not with a little catastrophe or predicament or distraction.Soon the principal tells him he's failing and that he may as well forget about the experiment. As Ernest is off sulking about it, two science teachers show up in his locker to reveal their biggest experiment to him - a potential brain accelerator. They make Ernest their ""Human Guinea Pig"" and see what happens.The experiment is successful and Ernest becomes significantly smart. He is extremely proficient at virtually everything from mathematics to drama to music. The only downside is that his personality turns snobbish and superior, alienating him from his friends. He impresses his teachers and it seems he is well on the way to graduating with top marks.While Ernest is doing well, Ms. Flugal, who is Ernest's love interest in the film, makes him band conductor and puts him in charge of directing the marching band in preparation for the halftime show during the football game. Ernest diligently does so and instructs the whole band to watch him if anything wrong happens. This rule is very instrumental in the ending result.Eventually, two bullies find out about Ernest's secret by watching him descend into his locker to recharge his intelligence. They in turn destroy the accelerator right before the night of the football game. The whole procession is ultimately ruined when Ernest realizes he can't recharge and has to direct the band with his usual mind and intelligence. He spends the whole disastrous affair with his head inserted in a tuba which resulted after he descended toward the band from the podium in his clumsiness. He in turn disappoints the band, the audience who had to run from the resulting fire, the principal, and most of all, Ms. Flugal.Depressed, with the knowledge that he can't recharge his head any more, Ernest starts packing his things until he finds three of his friends mocking him. They force Ernest haplessly through days of study for the final exam, but Ernest proves hopeless, though his friends continue to help him. On the day of the big exam, Ernest is about to go in, but before he does, the scientists return and tell him excitedly that the brain accelerator has been repaired. Feeling for his friends who labored with him all that time, he declines to use the machine and takes the exam on his own.During the final quarter of the film, he football game finals take place. This final game is for the district championship. During the game, the board inspector, who personally wants the merger to happen, bribes the football coach into purposely losing the game against the rival team. As a school board member is in the audience, the forthcoming loss will likely convince the board the merger must happen. The coach accepts, resulting in the football team losing every play. Meanwhile, Ernest is still in charge in the marching band. Using his own ideas, he comes up with small routines during the halftime show. On the other hand, other members of the band are informed of the fix on the game and sneak off. With the help of the two science teachers, they infiltrate the locker room with sleeping gas, effectively replacing the football team to win the game themselves. During the game between the rival team and the replacements, the two scientists reveal to Ernest their new brain accelerator. He immediately charges up and becomes the coach for the team. With his new intelligent strategies, the tide turns and they start winning.However, in the last play of the game, Ernest forgets to recharge and loses his intelligence while in play. He ends up rolling down field on a drum after the ball that was thrown and flies into the end zone, catching it. The team wins just as the football players arrive from the locker room in bewilderment and the board trustee is informed of the inspector's actions and intentions and the coach's involvement.In the end, the school stays open (they won the football game) and both the coach and the inspector get fired.

He makes particularly good progress with a blind teenager whose sessions with Mesmer provide her with a means of escape from her father, who's been raping her. At one point the girl hits her head, and regains her sight; Mesmer takes the credit, and they seem about to embark on an affair. However, Mesmer's jealous wife and the medical authorities conspire to have him exiled from Vienna.

The Silences of the Palace,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111055/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As she grows up, Alia (the daughter of housemaid Khedija) learns the secrets of the peaceful palace where she and her mother live. Set in 1950s Tunisia, a 25-year-old woman, Alia, returns to her place of birth-a prince's palace in which her mother, Khedija, worked as a house servant and mistress of prince Sid' Ali. She had fled the palace ten years earlier, at which time she spent burying tortured memories of her childhood. In her visit to pay respects for the death of the prince, she wanders through the largely abandoned palace where she is confronted by these memories represented as detailed flashbacks of her childhood. She begins to piece together a narrative about her mother's sexuality and sexual exploitation in a space ordered by gender and class difference, and is re-awakened to her persistent questioning about her father's identity. As she negotiates her past, she also deals with her current relationship to her lover, Lotfi, who has asked her to have another abortion. Her development throughout the film contrasts her awakening to a past of sexual and social servitude which many of the female servants experienced in the palace against her own contested independence fraught with pain, conflict and uncertainty. Undereducated but wised up by time, Khedija (Amel Hedhili) is a typical strong woman who strives to live the life's burden.This beautiful housemaid (good at belly dancing and comes from some unclear lineage--something not uncommon among the poors who live in a culture in which people are commonly traded) has a daughter, Alia (Hend Sabri/Ghalia Lacroix).She realizes that her irressistable appeal to men, besides giving her some welfare and security insurance, one too many times tends to invite troubles--something she always wishes will never happen to Alia.With the setting of 1950's Tunisia (when the French's backed-up monarch almost comes to an end), the story take us to see the world from Alia's eyes: the childhood with all its joys and unprejudiced free spirit, adolescence with its sensitivities and curiousities, up to when she reaches adulthood--the time when life dares her to choose her own destiny."

Marry a rich young man with a wealthy estate to please his dying mother, and she'll be well taken care of. What she doesn't know is the family has plans to sacrifice her baby!—Humberto Amador NOTE: The aswang is a vampire from Filipino myth. It is a living person, usually a woman, who can take the form of a large bird and who waits on the roof of a victim's house until s/he falls asleep. Then, the aswang drops down its long tongue, pricks a hole in the victim's neck, and feeds on its blood. Once filled with blood, the aswang returns home to feed her own children. In this movie, the aswang is particularly fond of feeding on the unborn.Kat (Tina Ona Paukstelis) is unwed and pregnant but refuses to get an abortion. Instead, she opts for adoption and contracts with Peter (Norman Moses) and Janine Null to give them her baby after it is born, as Janine is unable to bear children and Peter needs an heir so that he can inherit the family estate, a large tract of apple orchards in Wisconsin.7 Months later: Very pregnant and posing as Peter's wife Janine, Kat accompanies
Peter to visit his family at the estate. Having lived in the Philippines,
the family is rather strange. There is Peter's mother Olive (Flora Coker), who is ailing
and is confined to a wheelchair. Peter's sister Claire (Jamie Jacobs Anderson), whom Peter
describes as ""touched"", lives as a recluse in a rundown cottage, and Peter
warns Kat to steer clear of her. And there is Cupid (Mildred Nierras), their Filipino maid
who seems to be the one who holds everyone and everything together. All in
all, though, Olive and Cupid seem genuinely glad to have ""Janine"" there,
and both are very anxious for the baby to arrive.At dinner that evening, Kat drinks too much of Cupid's ""homemade
apple cider"" and gets drunk. That night she has strange dreams about Peter
feeding on some white liquid and then putting his head between her legs as
though trying to listen to the baby. The next morning, while out walking
on the Hull property, Peter and Kat happen upon a trespasser, who
introduces himself as Dr Roger Harper (John Kishline) and who shows them a strange
""cocoon"" he has found. Harper has already found scores of them and can't
explain what kind of animal made them, only that the bodies inside have
been reduced to bones and it seems as though they've had their lives
sucked out of them.Peter is unhappy about Harper poking around on their land, but Kat
invites him to dinner anyway. After dinner, Peter shows him some artwork
from the Philippines, including a drawing of an aswang, a dark figure
sitting on a rooftop and sticking its long skinny tongue down into the
house. Upon returning home, Harper looks up a picture of an aswang,
under which the caption reads ""as*wong: a Filipino vampire who feeds on the
unborn. The fetus will likely die, although some survive to become Aswang
themselves."" Harper immediately fears for Kat/Janine's baby, but he
doesn't have time to warn her. He is himself attacked by an aswang.Meanwhile, Kat and Peter have gone to bed, and Cupid is helping Olive
into her nightclothes. While Kat sleeps, an aswang slides its long tongue
into her bedroom and snakes around under the bedsheets until it finds the
way between her legs. Kat wakes up, dislodges the tongue, and manages to
trap it in the door. Peter rushes outside to find Olive hanging from the
bedroom window by her aswang tongue. In order to release her, Peter has to
cut off her tongue.Sensing that she's in danger, Kat runs...straight to Claire's cottage
where she finds Harper enwrapped in a cocoon. Still alive, he tries to
warn her. Kat tries ripping him free from the cocoon but, before she is
successful, she hears a noise. It is the real Janine, and she's armed with
a chainsaw. Janine attacks Kat, but Kat manages to kill her with a blow to
the head from a garden hoe.Enter Peter, who injects Kat with a tranquilizer. Kat tries to run,
but Peter retrieves the chainsaw and goes after her while screaming, ""We
have a contract...This is America...We have laws!"" Kat gets away but
stumbles onto the grave of Janine Hull. It's now apparent that ""the real
Janine"" is actually Peter's sister Claire and that both she and
Olive are aswangs.Peter carries the bodies of Olive and Claire into the big house.
While walking along the highway, Kat is ""rescued"" by the local sheriff who
takes her straight back to the Nulls, oblivious to Kat's contention that
they are trying to kill her. After the sheriff leaves, Peter takes Kat to
Claire's cottage and chains her to a window. But the sheriff, doing his
duty, calls for some information about Janine Hull and comes up empty, so
he returns to the Hull house, where he is attacked and killed by a chicken
(Peter).Peter, Olive, and Cupid go to the cottage. Olive is dying and must
feed. While they prepare Kat, however, Olive dies, so Peter decides to
feed on Kat's baby himself. At that moment, however, Harper wakes up and
Peter has to kill him first, giving Kat a chance to chop off her own hand
with an ax and run away...straight back to the Hull house, Peter in
pursuit, garden hoe in hand.Meanwhile, Cupid has gotten religious. She falls down on her knees
and starts to pray. When Peter orders her to kill Kat, she raises the ax
to obey. Just at that moment, a tiny aswang tongue emerges from between
Kat's legs, and Cupid lets the ax fall.Five years later
Cupid and the 5-year old aswang girl are saying their prayers
together, blessing Grandma Olive, Aunt Claire, Daddy (Peter), and a number
of Janine-mommies. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

The Emigrant,1994,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110545/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ram leaves the nomadic life and embarks on a quest for knowledge in a pharaonic Egypt mired in political intrigue. Based on a biblical story. The biblical tale of Joseph is told from an Egyptian perspective in this interesting character study. In this film, Joseph is called Ram. Ram, tired of his family's backward superstitious life, and tired of being picked on by his brothers, wants to go to Egypt to study agriculture. His brothers travel with him across Sinai, but then suddenly sell him to Ozir, an Egyptian who works for a Theban military leader, Amihar. Amihar is impressed by Ram's drive and personal charm and so grants Ram some desolate land outside the capital. Ram soon finds himself a pawn in the political and sexual games between Amihar and his wife Simihit, a high priestess of the Cult of Amun.—Sandra Brennan In this film, young Ram is a thinker who has grown up in a primitive and superstitious society, hated by his brothers and suspected of sorcery. Dissatisfied with the nomadic lifestyle of his family, he dreams of traveling to Egypt to study agriculture. Forewarned by his weather knowledge, he saves the family's flocks from a destructive sandstorm, and manages to persuade his father to let him leave for Egypt. His older brothers travel with him, but at the shipping dock they tie him up, knock him out, and dump him into the hold of a boat traveling to Egypt. When he wakes up, he is discovered by the boat owner family, who intend to sell him as a slave. They let Ram know that this sale would be his opportunity to enter the service of a powerful family, since the man they wish to sell him to, Ozir, is assistant to Amihar, the military head of Thebes. Ram actively participates in the bargaining to get the best possible price for his purchase. His initial months as a slave are a disappointment, however, since he is assigned to assist in the mummification of bodies rather than learning about agriculture. Ram is not afraid to express his contempt for the Egyptian obsession with death and the preservation of one's mortal remains, and affirms his belief in one God and the immortality of the soul independent of one's body. Amihar is impressed by Ram's honesty, takes a personal liking to the young man, and gives Ram a chance to convert a barren stretch of land into a working farm. Through a combination of hard work, good mentoring, and a bit of luck, Ram is successful in this endeavor.Unfortunately, Ram becomes caught up in an intertwined mesh of sexual, political, and religious intrigues. Amihar is a eunuch, a former harem guard, and Ram catches the eye of Simihit, his wife. Ram's relationship with Simihit and Amihar is far more complex than in the Biblical version of the story. As in the Bible, when Simihit is caught after making advances towards Ram, she tries to cover her tracks by accusing Ram of attempted rape. Amihar does not necessarily believe her. He asks Ram what happened, but Ram steadfastly defends Simihit's honor, leaving Amihar no choice but to have him thrown into prison. Simihit is deeply affected by Ram's willingness to accept prison rather than reveal her attempted infidelity and relents of her accusation, confessing the truth. After Ram's release, he becomes involved in a power struggle between the wealthy followers of Amun, chief of the traditional Egyptian pantheon, versus the oppressed followers of Aten, god of the monotheistic Atenist heresy. Although Simihit is a priestess of Amun, she is a secret convert to the Cult of Aten. Throughout these troubles, Ram is fiercely loyal to both Simihit and Amihar, and his loyalty is rewarded by his release from slavery. Over the subsequent years, he rises in stature, takes an Egyptian wife, and becomes a trusted adviser to Pharaoh. Severe famine strikes, and Joseph's brothers turn up asking for food. Ram toys with his brothers before revealing his identity, and they become reconciled. The movie ends with Ram and his family traveling back to his homeland and becoming reunited with his father.-- from Wikipedia"

The complexities of life with colorful characters in the refugee transit camp and nearby kibbutz makes it hard to reconcile their real lives with their deeper dream of still finding the Newland.—Ron Weissman <rotawe@gti.net> We found this movie lacking any compassion. The characters in it seem to just be wondering around without any purpose - the plot is simply shallow and lacked focus. The two main characters the brother and sister who arrived from Poland are portrayed as very close to each other. However the brother, who is older, ditches his sister for a tempting offer to join the Kibbutz. He returns back to her when the sister puts things back in perspective about their past together. Really? I find it hard to believe that two sibling who are close and survived the Holocaust would so easily part after what they have been through. Sure, he did attempt once to bring his sister on board but when that failed she literally became none existant to him. The movie ends with the brother and sister seeking another new land after they are fed up with their mistreatment. I really liked the flying bear touch who takes them to a new destination (NOT) - Back to Europe perhaps? Most men in this movie are portrayed as irresponsible selfish cheaters. This movie is without doubt biased.—Eyal Bar-David"
