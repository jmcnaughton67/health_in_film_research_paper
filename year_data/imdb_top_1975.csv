Jaws,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a killer shark unleashes chaos on a beach community off Cape Cod, it's up to a local sheriff, a marine biologist, and an old seafarer to hunt the beast down. It's a hot summer on Amity Island, a small community whose main business is its beaches. When new Sheriff Martin Brody discovers the remains of a shark attack victim, his first inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers. This doesn't sit well with Mayor Larry Vaughn and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs down to his regret as that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. The dead boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience hunting sharks, Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee. Soon Quint, Brody and Matt Hooper from the Oceanographic Institute are at sea hunting the Great White shark. As Brody succinctly surmises after their first encounter with the creature, they're going to need a bigger boat.—garykmcd One short week before the annual 4th of July celebrations, Martin Brody, the new police chief of the small summer resort town of Amity Island, has reasons to believe that the mangled body of the missing young swimmer found washed up on shore is the work of a predatory shark. Worried about the unsuspecting tourists, Brody insists on closing down the beaches; however, greed, and Mayor Larry Vaughn, get in the way of security, only to spark a series of additional bloody attacks. Now, all eyes are on the deep blue ocean, while Brody, along with the marine biologist, Matt Hooper, and the expert shark killer, Quint, hunt for the undisputed ruler of the sea: a monstrous, slate-grey great white shark that patrols the waters, hungry for human flesh. But, can they outsmart the ultimate aquatic man-eater, and escape from its massive jaws?—Nick Riganas The peaceful community of Amity island is being terrorized. There is something in the sea that is attacking swimmers. They can no longer enjoy the sea and the sun as they used to, and the spreading fear is affecting the numbers of tourists that are normally attracted to this island. After many attempts the great white shark won't go away and sheriff Brody, with friends Hooper and Quint decide to go after the shark and kill it.—Sami Al-Taher <staher2000@yahoo.com> A Great White Shark decides to make the small beach resort town of Amity his private feeding grounds. This greatly frustrates the town police chief who wants to close the beaches to chase the shark away. He is thwarted in his efforts by the town's mayor who finally relents when nothing else seems to work and the chief, a scientist, and an old fisherman with revenge on his mind take to the sea to kill the beast.—<drewgrgich@netzone.com> During an evening beach party on a New England coast, attractive blonde Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie) catches the eye of partygoer Tom Cassidy (Jonathan Filley) and leads him away from the group to go skinny-dipping in the ocean. Tom, quite drunk, passes out on the sand before he can even undress, but Chrissie, undeterred, strips down and dives into the surf.As Chrissie swims further from the shoreline, she pauses to tread water. An unseen creature notices Chrissie's paddling legs from beneath the surface and begins to approach her. Chrissie is quickly attacked by the creature, which grabs hold of her leg and, after a violent struggle, drags her below the waves. Her screams for help go unheard, and eerie silence follows her submergence.The surrounding town of Amity is preparing for the upcoming Independence Day weekend, their most financially lucrative time of the year. The community depends on tourism as a major source of economic support and waits eagerly for each summer to arrive when herds of mainlanders come to savor Amity's shores. Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Amity's chief of police, receives a call at home regarding Chrissie Watkins' disappearance. Following the report made by Tom Cassidy that she was last seen off the coast, Brody goes to the beach with his deputy Jeff Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer) to search for clues. Hendricks soon stumbles upon the segmented remains of Chrissie, washed up on the shore and being feasted upon by crabs.Back at the police station, Brody receives a call from the coroner (Robert Nevin) , who determines that Chrissie Watkins was the victim of a shark attack. Fearing for the safety of Amity's many swimmers, Brody immediately prepares to close the beaches until further investigations can be made. His intentions are quickly noticed by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who, fearing for the income loss that would result from closing the beach at such a pivotal point in the summer, attempts to convince Brody that a shark attack is too hasty a conclusion, and pressures him and the coroner to change Chrissie's official cause of death to mutilation by boat propeller. Brody remains dedicated to the safety of Amity's citizens and tourists, regardless of the financial toll the town might endure. However, Vaughn forbids him to close the beaches just yet.Over the next few days, ferryloads of tourists arrive on Amity's docks. The beaches are crowded each day, and Brody is extremely concerned about more potential attacks. As Brody and his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary) sit in the sand, Brody scans the shoreline for any sign of trouble. A ways down the beach, young Alex Kintner (Jeffrey Voorhees) asks his mother for permission to go swimming. Though Mrs. Kintner (Lee Fierro) notes that her son's fingers are starting to ""prune"" from the time he has already spent in the water that day, she allows him ten more minutes. Alex and his yellow raft enter the ocean one last time before being set upon by what is unmistakably an enormous shark. Amid the ensuing panic of the other beachgoers, Mrs. Kintner, who had not seen the attack, calls out desperately for her son as the bloodied and shredded remains of his raft wash up in the surf.With dozens of witnesses to Alex Kintner's gruesome death, the presence of a shark in Amity waters is undeniable and Brody is finally permitted to close the beaches. Alex's grieving mother offers a $3000 reward to anyone who can catch the shark that killed her son, and a town meeting is held to discuss the official shark problem. Brody announces that the police department is expanding its efforts to keep the beaches safe, as well as bringing in a shark expert from the Oceanographic Institute to assist them. Most of the assembled townspeople are more concerned with finances than safety, and remain angry about the beaches being closed, although Mayor Vaughn assures them it will only be for 24 hours. The chatter is quelled by Sam Quint (Robert Shaw), an eccentric and roughened local fisherman who guarantees the capture and slaughter of the offending shark for the price of $10,000. Though his offer is not accepted at that point, Quint seems confident that the job will fall to him eventually.With Mrs. Kintner's reward made public, scores of amateur shark hunters crowd Amity's docks, coming from all over the Northeast. Two local men make a clumsy attempt to lure the shark with a pork roast, which results in one of them nearly becoming the shark's third victim. Arriving at the same time as the horde of overconfident fishermen is Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the shark expert from the Oceanographic Institute hired by the Amity police. After meeting with Brody, Hooper is allowed to view the remains of Chrissie Watkins, which are brought to him in an ominously small container. Hooper, visibly shaken after examining the mangled body parts, assures Brody that Chrissie did not die in a boating accident, but was attacked by a shark.The town breathes a sigh of relief when the corpse of a large tiger shark is displayed on the docks, having been caught by some of the contending fishermen. Brody is initially elated, believing the nightmare to be over, until Hooper examines the creature's mouth and determines that its bite radius does not match the wounds on Chrissie Watkins' remains, and therefore is likely not the shark they are seeking. Hooper, wanting to be certain, suggests that he examine the contents of the shark's stomach, as its slow digestive system would ensure that any recent meals would still be inside. Brody supports this plan, but Vaughn seems disturbed by the notion and disapproves.
The crowd falls silent as Mrs. Kintner arrives, clad in black and choking back tears, presumably returning from her son's funeral. She approaches Brody and slaps him across the face, furiously accusing him of keeping the beaches open despite having prior knowledge that there was a man-eating shark in the water. Brody, angry and ashamed, becomes all the more determined to prevent further attacks.While Brody attempts to unwind at home with his wife and children, Hooper stops by to discuss the shark situation, underlining his earlier suspicion that the captured tiger shark is not the animal responsible for the deaths of Alex Kintner and Chrissie Watkins. He believes that the culprit is not a tiger shark, but a Great White, and that unless it is stopped, it will likely remain in Amity's waters until its food source is depleted. Hooper and Brody decide to examine the shark's stomach contents themselves, regardless of Mayor Vaughn's opinions.The men visit the deserted docks at night and locate the dead tiger shark. Hooper slices its belly open, only to find some bisected fish, several tin cans, and a Louisiana license plate, leading him to theorize that the shark made it's way up the Atlantic coast from the Gulf of Mexico. Finding no human remains, Hooper and Brody confirm that this cannot be the shark they are after.Hooper convinces Brody to continue their investigation out on the water, though Brody is terrified of the ocean. Using sonar equipment, Hooper locates a large object a good distance away from the shoreline. Brody recognizes it as the boat of Ben Gardner (Craig Kingsbury), a local fisherman. Hooper decides to investigate the half-submerged craft, despite Brody's protests, and dons his scuba gear before entering the water. Hooper discovers a large hole in the hull of the boat, and finds an enormous tooth embedded in the side. While examining the tooth, he is suddenly horrified to see the corpse of Ben Gardner floating out of the hull, one of his eyes missing. Hooper drops the tooth and his flashlight and rushes to the surface.Brody and Hooper make yet another attempt to reason with the mayor, hoping their latest discoveries will make a difference. Vaughn, however, still stubbornly dismisses their arguments, insisting that even with the evidence of Ben Gardner's ravaged boat, there is no proof that a shark is responsible. Hooper explains that he pulled the tooth of a Great White Shark out of the hull of Gardner's boat, but Vaughn merely rebuffs him once again since Hooper cannot produce the tooth he dropped in the water. Though he allows Brody and Hooper to take precautions to keep the beaches safe, he refuses to close them.Independence Day weekend finally arrives, bringing plenty of tourists, but the beachgoers are made uneasy by the numerous police boats patrolling the water for the shark. Vaughn is concerned that no one is swimming, and asks a personal friend in attendance to enter the water, along with his wife and grandchildren, to put everyone's minds at ease. The man and his family reluctantly and warily obey, and others begin to relax and follow suit.Remaining on the beach, Brody is aiding with shark patrol. When his elder son Michael (Chris Rebello) wishes to take his new sailboat out into the water with his friends, Brody asks him to take it into the adjacent estuary just to be safe. Michael reluctantly agrees. In the meantime, a dorsal fin appears among the swimmers in the main water, and panic erupts. The crowd scrambles back onto the beach and the police boats close in, only to discover that the ""shark"" is merely a cardboard fin wielded by two young pranksters in snorkel gear.The beachgoers begin to relax, but a young woman overlooking the water sees the unmistakable form of a huge shark making its way into the estuary where Michael and his friends are sailing. The woman's cry is first dismissed as another prank, but when Ellen reminds her husband that their son is in the pond, Brody goes to investigate. Michael and his friends are approached by a man in a rowboat (Ted Grossman), who is instructing them on knotting techniques, when both vessels are suddenly capsized by the shark. The startled sailors surface, and Michael watches in paralyzed horror as the man fails to reach his rowboat before the shark rips him apart.Michael and his friends are brought safely to shore, though Michael is taken to the hospital to be treated for shock. Brody confronts Vaughn once again and puts his foot down, demanding that real action be taken to deal with the shark. Vaughn, for once, is vulnerable and shaken, realizing that his own children were on the beach that day as well. He finally relents and gives Brody full permission to close the beaches and do all that is necessary to stop the shark. Sam Quint is immediately hired.Though Quint, a vastly experienced shark hunter, desires to take on the mission alone, Brody insists that he and Hooper will go as well. There is instant tension between Quint and Hooper, with Quint seeing Hooper as a rich snob with no real shark-hunting experience, and Hooper seeing Quint as a reckless thrill-seeker with a bullish attitude. Though Hooper proves himself to be a capable sailor, the discomfort remains as the three men embark on their voyage in Quint's boat, the ""Orca.""Once out to sea, the men set about attracting the shark by ladling chum off the stern of the boat. Quint attaches a line of piano wire to a sturdy rod secured against a specially-designed fishing chair on the deck. After hours of waiting, the wire goes taut and eventually snaps as the immense creature swims under the boat before disappearing again. Brody, Hooper, and Quint realize the enormous strength of their adversary.As the voyage presses on with no further sign of the shark, Brody grumpily ladles more chum off the back of the boat when, without warning, the massive head of a Great White shark emerges briefly in their wake. Brody is stunned and alerts the others. Hooper notices the shark beginning to circle the boat, and Quint rushes out for a look. He estimates that the shark is 25 feet long, and weighs three tons. After barking orders to Brody and Hooper, Quint begins to fire harpoons tied to plastic barrels, intended to both slow the shark down and make its presence more visible. Though Quint hits the shark with three harpoons, the barrels have no effect and the shark easily pulls them underwater. Just in time, Hooper manages to attach a tracking device to the beast before it retreats again.That night, the men have dinner and drinks below deck, and Hooper surprisingly begins to bond with Quint as they compare scars from their experiences with various sea creatures. Brody notices that Quint has had a tattoo removed, and Quint admits that the former tattoo represented the US Navy cruiser Indianapolis, on which he had been a sailor in World War II. Quint goes on to illustrate the horrible day in July of 1945 when the Indianapolis was sunk by Japanese torpedoes, leaving over 1,100 men floundering in shark-infested waters. Quint witnessed 800 of his comrades being picked off by sharks, and is clearly affected by the chilling memory. The experience, combined with survivor's guilt, had ignited Quint's deep-seated hatred of sharks and the ruthless satisfaction he finds in hunting them. After the solemnity of Quint's story, the men sing a rowdy sea chantey to lighten the mood, but are interrupted by the returning shark violently crashing into the boat and causing a leak. Quint rushes on deck and fires a rifle at the three telltale barrels, but the shark escapes once again.The next day, the men attempt to repair the boat, with limited success. Seawater has contaminated the diesel fuel, and the black smoke billowing from the exhaust pipe confirms engine damage. When the shark returns, Quint instructs Hooper to grab the barrels with a hook and secure them to the stern. Hooper succeeds, and Quint attempts to drag the shark by powering the boat to full throttle, but the shark uses its incredible strength to pull the boat in the opposite direction, nearly capsizing it and causing further structural damage before Quint cuts the ropes attached to the boat. The shark breaks free from the barrels and submerges again. Quint demonstrates his mad obsession with shark hunting by destroying the radio on which Brody was attempting to call for help. The shark begins to chase the boat, and Quint steers back toward land at full speed, dismissing Hooper's protests that he is overtaxing the already damaged engine. When the engine inevitably fails, the boat is left to slowly sink. Quint, strangely calm, offers life jackets to the other men, though he takes none for himself.Running out of options, Hooper resorts to putting on his scuba gear and having Quint and Brody lower him into the water inside a shark-proof cage, his aim being to inject the shark with poison using a harpoon syringe. Quint points out that the needle is too small to pierce the shark's hide, but Hooper believes he can inject the beast in the mouth. The cage proves to be no match for the shark, who attacks Hooper with such ferocity that he drops the harpoon and is forced to hide in a reef while his cage is destroyed. Brody and Quint haul up the remains of the shark cage, and can only assume that Hooper is dead. They barely have time to react before the shark leaps from the water like a breaching whale and lands most of its body on the sinking stern of the boat, nearly breaking the vessel in two. Quint and Brody desperately cling to the cabin as the boat is upended, with the shark's gaping mouth at the bottom of the drop. Quint ultimately loses his grip and, despite Brody's efforts to pull him to safety, slides into the mouth of the shark and is gruesomely killed. The shark, with Quint's bloodied corpse in its mouth, slides back into the water.Horrified, and believing himself to be the only survivor of this seemingly doomed mission, Brody hastily enters the cabin of the rapidly sinking boat and finds one of Hooper's pressurized air tanks. The shark smashes through the side of the boat, its enormous mouth perilously close to Brody, who attempts to fend it off by bludgeoning it with the tank. The shark retreats, with the air tank now lodged in its jaws.With little more than the boat's mast remaining above water, Brody climbs to its summit with a rifle in his hand. Now possessing some of Quint's courage and madness, Brody begins to fire at the approaching shark, aiming at the air tank in its mouth. At last, Brody hits his mark. The tank explodes, taking the shark's head with it, and Brody laughs triumphantly as blood and shark flesh rain down around him into the sea.Moments after the shark's vibrant destruction, Hooper finally surfaces, and the exhausted Brody is relieved to see him alive. The men share a weak chuckle before assembling a makeshift raft and paddling back to Amity's shore."
The Rocky Horror Picture Show,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A newly-engaged couple have a breakdown in an isolated area and must seek shelter at the bizarre residence of Dr. Frank-n-Furter. On a wild and rain-swept late-November evening, somewhere at an empty stretch of road outside Ohio's merry Denton, blissfully-affianced, prudish, boringly-innocent young pair Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) find themselves stranded on their way to visit an ex-tutor. Instead, the couple will inadvertently unearth the cross-dressing Dr. Frank-N-Furter's (Tim Curry's) spooky lair of inexhaustible oddities, just in time to partake in the out-of-this-world mad scientist's proud unveiling of his latest, delightfully extravagant, most daring creation: the ultimate male and the perfect sex symbol: the flaxen-haired Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). But, little by little, as the effervescent transgressive force gobbles up whole the unsuspecting visitors of the night, Brad and Janet slowly begin to embrace the potent fascinations of seduction, while an idolized Rocky roams free in the mansion. Who can interrupt man's union with the absolute pleasure?—Nick Riganas On a dark and stormy November evening, newly engaged innocents Brad Majors and Janet Weiss are driving from their Denton hometown to visit their former high school science teacher and now friend, Dr. Everett Scott. Along the way, they face car trouble, and find an isolated mansion where they hope to be able to use the telephone to call for road service. Instead of getting in, getting help and leaving quickly to get on their way as is their hope, Brad and Janet get caught up in the goings-on at the mansion of its master, a transvestite scientist, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, who this evening generally favors panties and bustiers. Beyond the annual Transylvanian Convention ball taking place, they also become privy to Dr. Furter's private unveiling of her latest scientific project. If they could speak to Dr. Scott, they would further learn the bigger secret kept by Dr. Furter and her closest associates. If Brad and Janet are able to make it out of the diabolic lair that is Dr. Furter's mansion alive, they may be forever changed from their innocent selves by the experience.—Huggo While driving home on a rainy night, strait-laced lovebirds Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) end up by chance at the castle of one Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) and his bizarre entourage and find that he's having a party. This is no ordinary party, no ordinary night. This is the unveiling of the doctor's latest creation: Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), a man-made Adonis that will give absolute pleasure. Over the course of the night, Frank seduces both Brad and Janet, Janet and Rocky become Biblically involved, and Dr. Everett V. Scott (Jonathan Adams) arrives looking for his nephew Eddie (Meat Loaf) (whom Frank killed earlier in this movie). This is an exceedingly grand visual and musical camp satire of the golden days of the B-movie horror and science-fiction genres. Projected along with a musical soundtrack to give audience participation a new meaning in dimension, time, and space, this shall be a night that Brad and Janet will remember for a very long time in the sexually kinky, rock 'n roll, rock-opera world of a gender-bending scientist - and his time warped plans.—Cinema_Fan Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon), newly engaged, stumble onto the castle of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) during a rainstorm. Taking refuge in the castle, they're present for the doctor's unveiling of his newest creation, Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). Over the course of the night, Frank seduces both Brad and Janet, Janet and Rocky become involved Biblically, Dr. Everett V. Scott (Jonathan Adams) arrives looking for his son Eddie (Meat Loaf) (whom Frank killed earlier in this movie), and the guests discover that Frank is actually an alien (a transvestite from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy Transylvania) who's succeeded in creating the Sonic Transducer, ""an audio-vibratory physiomolecular transport device"" capable of ""breaking down solid matter and then projecting it through space and, who knows, perhaps even time itself.""—Leo Over the opening credits a large set of a woman's lips in red lipstick sing the opening song ('Science Fiction-Double Feature').Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) are two ""normal, ordinary, healthy kids"" in November 1974 from the small town of Denton, Ohio whom they first meet in Dr. Scott's college refresher course and fell in love. Now as the movie opens, they are attending the wedding of Ralph Hapschatt (Jeremy Newson) and Betty Monroe (Hilary Labow) in which Brad is Ralph's best man and Janet is the maid of honor. Inspired by the events around him, as soon as the other guests leave, Brad asks Janet to marry him in a song ('Damnit Janet') inside the church and she accepts. Joyous, the couple decide to go tell Dr. Scott the good news.Appearing all through the movie, a Criminologist (Charles Gray) comes on and explains that we are about to embark on a strange journey following the misadventures of Brad and Janet. He mentions that despite the storm clouds gathering, the two decided to go for a long drive in the country anyway even though their spare tire was badly in need of air. He claims that Brad and Janet will have ""a night to remember for a very long, time.""Back to Brad and Janet, as they drive on, the sun sets and, sure enough, it begins to rain very heavily. Janet is starting to feel ill at ease considering how far out they are and that a bunch of bikers keep passing them on the road and suggests that they should turn back before something bad happens. We hear a loud BANG! and the car skids to a stop.Brad realizes he messed up badly by not refilling the spare tire and suggests that the two of them go to an old castle they passed along the way to call for help. Janet isn't so sure this is a good idea, but Brad talks her into it anyway as there's not much they can do otherwise. As they walk through the rain, Janet tries to shield herself with a newspaper, telling herself through a song that no matter how bad things get, there's always a good side and that things will always get better. ('There's a Light... over at the Frankenstein Place')Soon the two arrive on the front doorstep of the castle. Brad knocks and just as the two were about to leave, the door is opened by Riffraff (Richard O'Brien), a tall, gaunt, balding butler in a stark black suit. He glares at them, further unnerving Janet, though Brad tries to be friendly, introducing himself and Janet and explaining that they need a phone as their car has broken down nearby.The foyer is outlandishly decorated with dark wooden furniture, stuffed dead animals and hunting trophies, and random relics and curiosities. Riffraff explains to Brad and Janet that they've arrived on a very special night as ""the master"" is having a party, where Brad and Janet meet the equally strainge house maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), which leads into the infamous song ""The Time Warp"".The Criminologist comes on and explains the steps to the 'Time Warp' dance.Brad and Janet are ushered into a great hall with a throne and a jukebox at it's far end where conventionists of every size and description wearing tuxedos and party hats are dancing and singing the ('Time Warp'). During the song we are introduced to the gold-sequin-wearing, tap dancing Columbia (Little Nell). All of this is too much for Janet and Brad who try to sneak out carefully. Janet begs Brad to leave as the place is creepy, but Brad simply says that they should stay to watch more ""folk dancing."" Janet refuses as she's ""cold, wet and just plain scared!"", though Brad tries to reassure her.Janet turns around to leave and sees Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) in full drag regalia, wrapped up in a black cloak. She screams and faints. Frank introduces himself though a song as a ('Sweet Transvestite') from Transsexual, Transylvania"". Brad asks him for help, explaining his plight, and Frank smirks and acknowledges that yeah, Brad needs help, and offers him a mechanic at first only to change his mind as ""Maybe the rain isn't REALLY to blame"" and instead decides to ""remove the cause but NOT the symptoms.""Frank then goes into an elevator and rises upstairs to the applause of the partying conventionists. Riffraff and Magenta strip Brad and Janet down to their underwear. Brad and Janet then are prodded into the elevator and taken upstairs to Frank's laboratory.Brad and Janet are led out into the center of an observing room where they are put on display by Dr. Frank N. Furter, now wearing a lab coat and long surgical gloves. The Transylvanian conventionists watch the events from an above balcony. Frank N. Furter then walks over to a box-like shape covered by a tarp and throws off the covering to reveal a tank. He shouts for Magenta and Riffraff to set the controls and start the machinery as the room darkens. Frank himself laughs maniacally as he turns knobs, dials, and wheels as fluids pour into the tank and a humanoid form appears slowly, skeleton first, much to Janet and Brad's terror.Carefully, Frank N. Furter leads out the humanoid figure wrapped entirely in bandages and cuts them away to reveal a full-grown man with blond hair, tanned skin, blue eyes and a muscular figure wearing only a skimpy golden bikini over his crotch. Riffraff spins some wheels he shouldn't have while cackling to himself, setting the blond man, known as Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), loose. Frank chases Rocky through the lab crying his name as a bouncy song about the creation ('I Can Make You a Man'), Rocky feeling a sense of dread plays. Eventually Frank catches Rocky and scolds him for misbehaving, but says he forgives him as he's beautiful ('Sword of Damocles').Then, the deep freeze malfunctions and Columbia squeals, ""Eddie!"" A burly, heavyset biker named Eddie (Meatloaf) rides out on a motorcycle, dressed in black leather, singing about his former glory ('Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?/Hot Patootie') The conventionists eat it up, enjoying the show, but Frank becomes wrathful that Eddie stole his thunder and takes out a pickax, chasing Eddie into the deep freeze where he is hacked to bits. This puts everyone, even the giddy conventionists into a shocked and somber mood. Frank, tires to pick things up by talking about how beautiful Rocky is in a song ('I Can Make You a Man, reprise'), leading away his new creation to a ""bedchamber"" in a wedding-style procession.The Criminologist comes on again and mentions that Brad and Janet are in trouble now as they are being led away to separate rooms for the night.While separated, Frank N. Furter comes into Janet's bedroom, dressed as Brad, and seduces Janet. Then he goes into Brad's room, dressed as Janet and tries to seduce Brad. Brad puts up a little bit of a fight, but is talked into it. Afterwards, Janet feels frightened and used and goes to look for Brad. Meanwhile, Rocky escapes from the bedchamber and is running loose, chased by dogs through the rain outside the castle by the gleeful Riffraff. While wandering the castle lost and afraid, Janet encounters Rocky hiding in his tank at the lab. Seeing that he's injured, she tears her petticoat to bandage his wounds, pausing as she realizes she's aroused.The Criminologist comes on and mentions the complexity of human emotions and the dangers of lust. He fades away to Magenta and Columbia who are secretly watching Rocky and Janet in the tank via a monitor in their room.Janet tries to seduce Rocky, explaining that she used to be a virgin, but now she finds she really likes sex and wants it NOW ('Toucha Toucha Touch Me'). Rocky is more than happy to oblige. Meanwhile, Columbia and Magenta watch in secret from the closed circuited TV, laughing and playing with one another, making fun of the events unfolding before them.As the two women enjoy one another, Frank N. Furter beats up Riffraff for letting Rocky loose, while Brad watches with horror. An alarm goes off and Riffraff looks on another TV monitor and mentions that someone is outside by the main gate as they all look and see a middle aged man in a wheelchair buzzing the intercom at the front gate. Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams) has arrived at the castle. Brad recognizes his old teacher and is happy to see him, but Frank N. Furter is angry that the two know one another, recognizing Dr. Scott as a federal agent investigating UFOs, suspecting Brad and Janet are actually spies. Brad denies this, explaining that Dr. Scott is his science teacher from Denton High, but Frank doesn't believe him.Meanwhile, Dr. Scott enters the castle and finds himself alone in the 'zen room' filled with various smoldering insence. Frank N. Furter takes Brad to the lab where he turns on a powerful magnet to drag Dr Scott's wheelchair up to them... with Dr. Scott still inside it. The clunk of Dr. Scott's wheelchair arriving wakes the sleeping Janet and Rocky who sit up in shock. Everyone in the room is frightened, confused and hurt to see one another here. Magenta appears up and announces that dinner is ready. Attempting to handle things with grace, Dr. Frank N. Furter dismisses everyone for dinner, informing them that formal attire is optional as he stomps off enraged.Everyone meets in a grand dining room for a dinner of roasted beef and vegetables in honor of Rocky's Birthday. Frank demands that everyone sing Rocky ""Happy Birthday."" Dr. Scott reveals in a song ('Eddie's Teddy') that he's not here to investigate Frank and his household, but to look for his nephew, Eddie, who went missing with a cryptic cry for help in a letter being the last contact he had from him. Sure, Eddie was a no good kid, but he's still family. In response to this, the tablecloth is pulled off the table to reveal Eddie's hacked-up body in a glass case... and the fact that they were being served roast Eddie for dinner. Brad and Dr. Scott are paralyzed with terror, and Janet runs to Rocky's arms. Frank is outraged, slapping Janet. Janet runs away with Frank chasing after her, encouraging her through a song ('Once in a While') to stop sleeping with everyone else as she's now his.Janet, followed by Frank N. Furter, Rocky, Brad, and Dr. Scott end up in the lab again. Frank pulls a switch to ""glue"" everyone's feet to the floor but his. Everyone tells Frank he's a ""Hot dog."" In response, he simply flips a switch and turns them all to stone. Columbia comes in and tells Frank he's gone too far this time as now people are really hurt. Frank N Furter simply responds by turning Columbia to stone, too. He then tells Riffraff and Magenta to prepare for the floor show.The Criminologist comes on and hints that in this place where nothing's as it seems, the Floor Show is going to be something very shocking.The next scene we see the statue versions of everyone on stage, now all wearing fishnets, makeup, a thong and the same bustier. One by one they are unfrozen, and they each sing and dance a song ('Floor Show') about how they've changed since they came here. Rocky and Columbia sing about their past times ('Rose Tint My World'). Frank N. Furter, Brad and Janet sing their own version ('Fanfare/Don't Dream It'). Dr. Scott is accidentally unfrozen and realizes that this place is a trap and everyone should run while they still are sane enough to escape. Frank N. Furter comes out like a prized showgirl and sings a solo, starting an orgy in a swimming pool that is uncovered as he sings. After the orgy, Frank N. Furter sings a song praising his wild and untamed household ('Wild and Untamed Thing').This song, however is interrupted by Riffraff and Magenta, now wearing strange uniforms and armed with laser ray guns. Riffraff informs Frank that it's all over as his mission was a failure due to Frank becoming too extreme. He declares that Frank is now his and Magenta's prisoner as he has been made commander, and that they're going back to their home planet of Transylvania in the Galaxy of Transexual immediately. Frank is happy for this, singing about how long he's been wanting to go back to the homeland he was exiled from ('I'm Going Home'). Riffraff stops him again and explains that only he and Magenta are going home; Frank N. Furter is to be killed as Riffraff replies: ""say hello to oblivion"".

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the Fall of 1963, a Korean War veteran and criminal pleads insanity and is admitted to a mental institution, where he rallies up the scared patients against the tyrannical nurse. McMurphy has a criminal past and has once again gotten himself into trouble and is sentenced by the court. To escape labor duties in prison, McMurphy pleads insanity and is sent to a ward for the mentally unstable. Once here, McMurphy both endures and stands witness to the abuse and degradation of the oppressive Nurse Ratched, who gains superiority and power through the flaws of the other inmates. McMurphy and the other inmates band together to make a rebellious stance against the atrocious Nurse.—Jacob Oberfrank 1963. With a few months left in his sentence, thirty-eight year old convict Randall Patrick McMurphy - ""Mac"" - serving time for several assaults and statutory rape, has just been transferred from a labor camp associated with Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution in Pendleton to a psychiatric hospital. Mac has been able to use acting ""crazy"" - having a belligerent and smart-alecky attitude and anti-authoritarian behavior - to his benefit in not having to do any work. He is at the hospital as the authorities at Pendleton want him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to prove he is not crazy, believing this is all an act to get out of work. He believes this stint will get him out of any more work while he serves out the remainder of his sentence. He is placed in a ward with a group of men who have differing degrees of lucidity and control of their mental faculties. He continues to behave in the same manner as always to get what he wants, using the other patients either as accessories or things for his own amusement. He adds to his list of goals to do anything to annoy the ward's tyrannical head nurse, Miss Mildred Ratched, whose seeming want is to break the spirit of any of the men in her care. In his battle with Nurse Ratched, Mac eventually tries to help the men get a voice of their own while in the hospital, and for some for their eventual return to the outside world.—Huggo R.P McMurphy, a convict serving time for statutory rape, pleads insanity to avoid labour duties in prison. Believing its all an act, the authorities send him to a mental institution where he will forego psychiatric evaluation. Whilst there, McMurphy attempts to liven up the patients and starts an uprising against the tyrannical head nurse - Mildred Ratched.—BecksyKane McMurphy thinks he can get out of doing work while in prison by pretending to be mad. His plan backfires when he is sent to a mental asylum. He tries to liven the place up a bit by playing card games and basketball with his fellow inmates, but the head nurse is after him at every turn.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick McMurphy (Nicholson), a criminal who has been sentenced to a fairly short prison term, decides to have himself declared insane so he'll be transferred to a mental institution, where he expects to serve the rest of his term free of prison labor and in (comparative) comfort and luxury.His ward in the mental institution is run by an unyielding tyrant, Nurse Ratched (Fletcher), who has cowed the patients (most of whom are ""voluntary"" or there by choice) into dejected institutionalized submission. McMurphy becomes ensnared in a number of power games with Nurse Ratched for the hearts and minds of the patients. All the time, however, the question is just how sane any of the players in the ward actually are and whether they really belong there.Throughout his stay at the hospital, McMurphy forms friendships with his fellow patients but the bonds are deepest with two in particular: Billy Bibbit (Dourif), a suicidal, stuttering manchild whom Ratched has humiliated and dominated into a quivering mess; and ""Chief"" Bromden (Sampson), a 6'5"" muscular Native American who has schizophrenia. Recognized by the patients in the ward as deaf, and unable to speak, they ignore him but also respect him for his enormous size. In the former, McMurphy sees a younger brother figure whom he wants to teach to have fun, while the latter is his only real confidant, as they both understand what it is like to be treated into submission.McMurphy initially insults Chief when he enters the ward, but attempts to use his size as an advantage (for example, in playing basketball, for which his height is favorable). When Mac sees how submissive the patients are under Ratched's tyrannical control, he resolves to antagonize her and undermine her authority as much as possible. At a counseling session, McMurphy proposes that the ward's work schedule be altered so that the patients can watch the World Series on television. When the 1st meeting comes to a halt under Ratched's authority, Mac takes wagers on whether he can lift the ward's marble water-treatment control panel and throw it through a window to escape and watch the Series at a bar. He naturally fails, but puts forth an extreme effort.The next discussion over changing the work detail quickly becomes a battle of wills when Ratched announces that a majority vote will be acceptable. However, Ratched, upon realizing that the vote may go McMurphy's way, deftly alters the rules, stating that votes must be taken from the Chronic and Vegetable patients . When the vote doesn't favor McMurphy, he begins to imagine the game is on TV and rallies most of the other patients behind him, causing a major ruckus.McMurphy leads the patients in a basketball game against the ward's orderlies. Chief Bromden proves to be an effective player, scoring several baskets. While the orderlies claim that the patients are cheating, McMurphy ignores their objections. While the patients later relax in the hospital pool, Mac finds out, from an orderly, that he won't be released at the end of his prison sentence, but will remain in the hospital for as long as the board and Ratched deem necessary.Another counseling session ensues and McMurphy, very upset at the orderly's revelation, finds out that he's been listed as a ""committed"" patient and will only be released when Ratched permits it, a highly unlikely scenario. Murphy also discovers that many of the patients in the ward are there voluntarily: they can leave any time they wish but due to Ratched's dominance, they are afraid to take the chance. McMurphy seems particularly upset that a young man like Billy remains on the ward voluntarily when he could be free and maybe enjoying his youth.The session quickly erupts in violence however, when the subject of Ratched's cigarette rationing is addressed by an upset patient named Charlie Cheswick. Nearly all the patients who play cards have lost money to McMurphy after he introduces them to Blackjack, prompting Ratched to ration their cigarettes. When Taber is burned by a lit cigarette and reacts loudly and violently and is dragged away, Ratched tries to restore order. Charlie suddenly becomes confrontational as well and a fight breaks out with the orderlies and Mac, Bromden (who'd pulled one of the orderlies off Mac) and Cheswick are sent to a detention area where electro-convulsive therapy is conducted on disruptive patients. Cheswick is sent first to undergo ECT, while McMurphy and Chief wait on the bench. In the few moments they have alone, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief verbally thanks him. A surprised McMurphy realizes that Chief can speak and hear him and has feigned his illness the whole time. McMurphy resolves to allow Chief in on his escape plan because of his hidden wisdom. Ending this scene, a more defiant McMurphy emerges from the detention area to an awaiting Nurse Ratched. Mac appears submissive, claiming he'll happily join the group again.Closer to Christmas McMurphy, fed up with Ratched's oppressive methods, sneaks into the nurse's station at night and calls his girlfriend, Candy, to bring booze and assist in his escape. She brings a girlfriend, and both enter the ward when McMurphy convinces the ward's night attendant, Mr. Turkle, to open one of the ward's secured windows. The patients drink heavily, while Billy flirts with McMurphy's girlfriend. The party becomes very loud, drawing the attention of Turkle's supervisor. Turkle hides them all in Ratched's office until he's able to convince the supervisor that only Candy is hiding in the office.The party goes on. Later in the evening, when McMurphy and the Chief plan to finally leave, Billy, upset at Mac's departure, hints to Mac that he wants a date with Candy. Billy and Candy are given a private room and Mac boosts Billy's confidence & allows him to have sex with her. McMurphy, however, while waiting (believing the encounter will be quick), falls asleep with the rest of the patients.Nurse Ratched and the orderlies arrive in the morning to discover the patients asleep and hung over and the ward and her office trashed. Though clearly upset and angry, she calmly commands the orderlies to lock the open window, escort Candy's friend out of the hospital and conduct a head count. When they discover that one patient, Billy, is missing, Ratched demands the others to reveal his whereabouts. Billy is discovered with Candy, who is immediately led out of the hospital.Ratched demands that Billy tell him who allowed him to have sex with Candy. Billy, his stutter noticeably gone, tells her that McMurphy did, and that the rest of the ward encouraged him. A passively angry Ratched then threatens to tell Billy's mother, citing her long-time friendship with her. Billy's stutter returns very quickly and, very upset, begs Ratched not to tell his mother. When she explains that he should have thought of the consequences, he breaks down into tears and is dragged away to Dr. Spivey's office, screaming. McMurphy, still in possession of Turkle's keys, unlocks one of the windows and is about to escape when Ratched's nurse assistant, Miss Pilbro, screams loudly.McMurphy and everyone else rush to Spivey's office. Having been left alone momentarily, he committed suicide, using a jagged piece of glass to slit his throat. After McMurphy sees what the ward has done to his friend and hears Ratched's orders for everyone to remain calm and return to their routine, he explodes into a violent rage, viciously strangling Nurse Ratched. She survives, but McMurphy is knocked unconscious by one of the orderlies and taken off the ward.For the next few weeks, rumors float around the ward of McMurphy's fate. Some believe he'd escaped, others seem to know he was lobotomized. Late one night, McMurphy is quietly returned to his bed by orderlies. The Chief sneaks over to Mac's bed and finds him unresponsive; he also sees two scars on Mac's forehead, indicating that he'd been lobotomized. Unwilling to leave McMurphy behind, the Chief suffocates his vegetable-like friend with a pillow. He lifts the heavy marble hydrotherapy fountain that Mac was unable to before and, hurling it through a barred window, escapes to Canada."

As day turns to night, the standoff continues until.—Huggo On one of the hottest days of August 1972, three amateur bank robbers plan to hold up a Brooklyn bank. A nice simple robbery: Walk in, take the money, and run. Unfortunately, the supposedly uncomplicated heist suddenly becomes a bizarre nightmare as everything that could go wrong does. Based upon a real-life story that happened in the early seventies in which the Chase Manhattan Bank in Flatbush, Brooklyn, was held siege by a bank robber determined to steal enough money for his transgender lover to undergo a sex change operation. On a hot summer afternoon, the First Savings Bank of Brooklyn is held up by Sonny Wortzik and Sal two down-and-out characters. Although the bank manager and female tellers agree not to interfere with the robbery, Sonny finds that there's actually nothing much to steal, as most of the cash has been picked up for the day. Sonny then gets an unexpected phone call from Police Captain Eugene Moretti, who tells him the place is surrounded by the city's entire police force. Having few options under the circumstances, Sonny nervously bargains with Moretti, demanding safe escort to the airport and a plane out of the country in return for the bank employees' safety. Written by alfiehitchieFirst-time crook Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and his friend Sal (John Cazale) rob a Brooklyn bank to fund Sonny's partner's sex change operation, only to discover that the bank has very little money. Unsure what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage. The police are alerted that there is a robbery in progress. Detective Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning) and numerous officers set up a siege around the bank. When Moretti calls the bank to tell the lead robber, Sonny, that the police have arrived, Sonny warns that he and his armed accomplice, Sal, have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries to come into the bank. Detective Moretti acts as hostage negotiator, while FBI Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) monitors his actions. Howard (John Marriott), the security guard, has an asthma attack, so Sonny releases him when Moretti asks for a hostage as a sign of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside the bank to see how aggressive the police forces are. After a moment, Sonny starts his now-famous ""ATTICA!"" chant, and the civilian crowd starts cheering for Sonny.After realizing they cannot make a simple getaway, Sonny demands transportation: a jet to take them out of the country. When a tactical team approaches the back door, he fires a shot to warn them off. Moretti tries to persuade Sonny that those police were a separate unit that he was not controlling. Later, Sonny incites the crowd by throwing money over the police barricades. Some overrun the barricade and a few are arrested. When Sonny's wife Leon Schermer (a trans woman) (Chris Sarandon) arrives, she reveals that Sonny is robbing the bank to pay for Leon's sex reassignment surgery and that Sonny also has a legal wife, Angie, and children. Leon refuses to speak with Sonny, even over the telephone.As night sets in, the lights in the bank all shut off. Sonny goes outside again and discovers that Agent Sheldon has taken command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when hostage Mulvaney (Sully Boyar) goes into a diabetic shock, Agent Sheldon lets a doctor through. While the doctor is inside the bank, Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone. The two have a lengthy conversation that reveals Leon had attempted suicide to ""get away from"" Sonny. She had been hospitalized at the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital until the police brought her to the scene. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal, to wherever they take the plane. Sonny tells police listening to the phone call that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery attempt.After the phone call, the doctor asks Sonny to let Mulvaney leave and Sonny agrees. Mulvaney refuses, instead insisting he remain with his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank again. They have brought his mother to the scene. She unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give himself up and Agent Sheldon signals that a limousine will arrive in ten minutes to take them to a waiting jet. Once back inside the bank, Sonny writes out his will, leaving money from his life insurance to Leon for her sex change and to his wife Angie.When the limousine arrives, Sonny checks it for any hidden weapons or booby traps. When he decides the car is satisfactory, he settles on Agent Murphy to drive Sal, the remaining hostages and him to Kennedy Airport. Sonny sits in the front next to Murphy while Sal sits behind them. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal won't accidentally shoot him. As they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, Agent Sheldon forces Sonny's weapon onto the dashboard, creating a distraction which allows Murphy to pull a pistol hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested and the hostages are all escorted to the terminal. The film ends with Sonny watching Sal's body being taken from the car on a stretcher."

Wicks is seriously injured, but steadies himself long enough to shoot Sam in the throat. Convinced he can trust no one, in desperation he kidnaps a woman on the street as she gets into her truck. Kathy (Faye Dunaway) is terrified, but drives Turner to her apartment. Terrified himself, he holds the gun on her as he tries to figure out what to do next.Gradually, Kathy begins to realize that Turner is in real trouble and doesn't want to hurt her, but she still doesn't believe his story. When 6pm rolls around, he turns on the evening news only to find that they are calling the incident in the alley an attempted robbery in which only Wicks was shot. There is no mention of Sam. Still unsure of Kathy's loyalty, he ties her up and sneaks over to Sam's apartment in her car. Sam's wife Mae (a former lover from college) has prepared dinner and drinks as if she and Sam were expecting him. When pressed, she reveals that the office (CIA) had called AFTER Sam met Joe in the alley to say he would be running late. Joe realizes that this is a trap and hustles Mae upstairs to the neighbors.Realizing the assassin is hard on his tail, he tries to get out of the building alive, and when he gets on the elevator, Joe finds himself next to a quiet man in a trenchcoat. This is Joubert (Max Von Sydow), a freelance assassin from Europe. (As we will learn, his hobbies include fine wine, classical music, and painting military miniatures from perhaps the Napoleonic Era.) Some inner sense tells Joe that this fellow is part of the problem, and Joe lags behind as Joubert walks out through the lobby. Convincing a group of loitering youth to walk out with him and screen him, he makes it back to Kathy's Bronco as the trenchcoated man waits nearby, holding a sniper rifle, seeking Joe in the crowd. Unable to get a clear shot, Joubert runs after the truck and uses his scope to get the vehicle's license plate number.Joe returns to Kathy's apartment just as her boyfriend is calling. Joe lets Kathy talk to the boyfriend, who is angry, at first, that she's not on her way their rendezvous. Kathy is on-the-edge but manages to hold up her end of the conversation. They hang up. Joe begins to feel guilty and tells her that he'll leave in the morning. They discuss her work (photography) and Joe pieces her life from his observations. Joe says he just wants to ""make it all stop"" for a few hours - the horror. They connect. They spent the night together.The next morning, Kathy is in the shower when THE Mailman (the guy who rang the bell at the building the day before) knocks at the door. Joe has been traced here via Joubert's writing down of the license plate the night before. The Mailman/hitman has a package for Kathy that must be signed for. Joe doesn't want to open the door but the Mailman has a well-rehearsed reply for every one of Joe's objections. (Joe yells through the window, ""She's not home!"" Mailman: ""That's OK, YOU can sign for it."" etc.) Joe opens the door but the Mailman's pen doesn't work (again, a rehearsed device to enable the Mailman to get inside and shut the door). As Joe goes looking for a pen he glances back at the Mailman's shoes. Suddenly, a stunned Joe realizes the Mailman is a hitman. He knows this because of the distinctive style of shoes he wears - one more thing Joe picked up in his voluminous reading. Thinking fast, he hurls hot coffee at the Mailman just as the nasty guy begins firing with a suppressor-equipped machine gun. The machine gun ends up on the floor. Joe's .45 is out of reach. A fight ensues - the Mailman is a martial arts expert with a nasty kick; Joe wields a fireplace poker and knows this man is a trained killer. Kathy emerges from her shower to find them fighting, provides a crucial bit of help to Joe, and retreats. The fight continues. Kathy's photo equipment plays a pivotal role. The fight concludes with Joe retrieving the .45 in the nick of time, firing two shots, and killing the Mailman/hitman. Kathy emerges to find her living room messed up and Joe sitting next to the dead mailman. She, needless to say, is terribly upset. Joe tries to console her. Joe searches the hit man and finds a couple of vital pieces of information including a hotel key (mentioned below). Joe and Kathy must now flee because the bad guys know where he is.Despite his fear, Joe has the beginnings of a plan, and Kathy agrees to help. They visit the NYC office of the CIA and Kathy pretends to apply for a job, then gets ""lost"" while she looks for Joe's section chief, Higgins. Once spotted, she helps Joe kidnap him while he eats lunch, and Higgins is hustled into the back of Kathy's Bronco. Interrogated by Turner, he confesses that he doesn't know what's going on any more that they do. ""This is obviously an inside operation"", he says, and it doesn't help that Wicks died, mysteriously, in the hospital. Joe confronts Higgins with the Mailman's ID and that he had a phone number that rang an office in CIA-Langley. Higgins begins to suspect that the lead assassin is Joubert, a former CIA assassin that now does contract work. Back at the office, Higgins does a search and finds information linking Joubert and the Mailman as partners in past CIA hits.Joe manages to put the pieces together by tracking down Joubert, the quiet man in the trenchcoat. Joe found a hotel key on the Mailman and finds Joubert in the same hotel. Tapping into the phone exchange in Joubert's hotel, he monitors the calls, and places an anonymous one himself to Joubert. ""Do you believe the Condor is an endangered species?"" he asks, and hangs up. Joubert quickly calls his controller, and Joe is able to track the call to a man named Atwood, a high-level supervisor in the CIA. From a telco trunk, he crosswires 50 phones to block a trace and calls to tell Higgins that he's found Joubert and asks who Atwood is. Higgins doesn't answer and Joe hangs up. One of Higgins supervisors is listening close by and tells him ""this"" needs to be ended, NOW. As he prepares to confront Atwood, Joe thanks Kathy for all her help, and they reluctantly part company.At Atwood's country home, the stereo suddenly comes on in the middle of the night, and when he investigates the noise in his study, Atwood finds Turner sitting quietly in a chair, holding a gun. Forced to confess, Atwood tells Joe that the hit on the section was due to that paper he'd sent to CIA headquarters. Joe demands to know why so many people had to die over some nothing book that suddenly became popular in the Middle East, Netherlands (Dutch), Mexico, Venezu......ohhhhh....OIL! Atwood is involved in a scheme to manipulate the world's oil markets and Turner's paper had hit too close to the truth. He and anyone else who might know about it had to be eliminated. Furious, Joe points the gun at Atwood.""Drop the gun,"" says a quiet voice; It's Joubert, standing quietly behind him. Realizing his defeat, Joe drops the pistol on the floor and waits for the inevitable, thinking that at least now he knows why all this has happened. Joubert, still holding his gun on Joe, takes a position next to Atwood, and like a cobra strike, turns and shoots Atwood in the right temple! As Joe stutters, Joubert places his gun in Atwood's hand and calmly begins to wipe down the room, asking what he had touched. Joe realizes that Joubert had a new contract to take out Atwood. Joubert confirms, ""Atwood had become an embarrassment,"" and that the contract that Atwood put on Condor has died with him.After leading him outside the house and handing back his pistol. ""Can I drop you somewhere?"", he asks in a friendly tone. Joe agrees to be taken back to New York. As they leave, Joubert advises that his life will never be the same again and there is no guarantee that ""someone"" won't decide that he's a liability in the future. He even describes how IT might happen, and offers that Europe is not a bad place to live. Impressed by how he handled the situation, Joubert suggests that he strongly consider a future as an assassin.With a new lease on life, Joe still has a few loose ends to tie up. Returning to New York, Joe waits for Higgins to walk past on the street, and they have a tense final confrontation. Higgins explains that the CIA does business this way because they need to. There is no other way. Turner disagrees, and as they stop in front of a distribution center of the New York Times, Turner tells Higgins that they've become too used to killing people as part of their job. He's told a reporter everything.""Ah, you fool,"" sighs Higgins. ""You've done more harm than you know."" As Turner walks away, Higgins calls after him. ""It didn't have to end this way Condor. You're about to become a very lonely man."" Joe seems not to care. He believes he's had his revenge on the CIA, and he fades away into the crowd as a Salvation Army Band plays Christmas music. But the haunting last words of Higgins linger in the air: ""How do you know they'll publish? How do you know???"""

Learning that Moxey must wake up at 6:00 a.m. to attend the school, Bobby says he would prefer to make less money and sleep late.Later that afternoon, Bobby delivers a car to Rose Miller (Dianne Hull), a waitress at a fast food restaurant. He asks for a ride home, but Rose refuses, saying that someone from the shop drove her to work in a dirty tow truck and she got a ketchup stain on her pants as a result.

The Other Side of the Mountain,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073496/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Young ski champion Jill Kinmont is left paralyzed after a tragic skiing accident. Her best friend suffers the same fate after contracting polio. Jill must slowly put her life back together again with the help of those close to her. Based on the true story of Jill Kinmont. In 1955, eighteen-year-old Jill is a truly talented, gifted skier and a shoo-in for the 1956 Winter Olympics. But Jill comes close to losing everything when she takes a near fatal fall off a mountain during the last race of the season. Paralyzed from the shoulders down, Jill now has to climb another kind of mountain-working her way up from total helplessness to leading a fulfilling life. With the help of family, friends, and an extraordinary man, Jill begins the quest up that mountain.—Anonymous A semi-fictional account ofJill Kinmontis presented, the account primarily on the transition out of her life as a skier. It's 1955, and she's part of the successful ski team of Bishop High School in Bishop, California under coach Dave McCoy. She and her best friend and teammate A.J. Nicholson dreamed of skiing in the Olympics together, dependent next year on they doing well in the regionals which factors into who is named to the national team. Much is made in the press of a relationship between Jill andBuddy Werner, arguably the most accomplished male skier on the regional circuit from the rival team from Boulder, that relationship despite Jill being more attracted to Dick Buek, a proverbial hot dogger who is already on the national team but who is engaged to someone else. Jill's Olympic dreams with A.J. are shattered when both their skiing lives are permanently sidelined, first A.J. due to health issues in a polio diagnosis, and second when Jill is involved in a horrific crash in the last race of the season. Her injuries lead not to a question of if she will ever walk again - which she won't - let alone ski but rather whether she will survive. Coming out the other end a quadriplegic, Jill has both to believe in herself in identifying as someone other than a skier, and to have others provide the supports she needs in seeing beyond her physical disability. One person arguably provides that support more than anyone else in truly believing in the strength within Jill if she only believes it herself.—Huggo"

The Hindenburg,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073113/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A chronicle of the Hindenburg disaster in which a zeppelin burst into flames. This film is a compendium of the facts and fiction of the events leading up to the disaster. For dramatic effect, Sabotage was chosen as the cause, rather than electricity lashing out at a couple of tons of hydrogen.—Charles Holland <charley@themovies.com.au> The Hindenburg is the pride of Nazi Germany, a dirigible with regular flights from Frankfurt to Lakehurst, New Jersey. When the Germans receive a warning that the Hindenburg will be destroyed by a bomb as it flies over New York City, they assign Luftwaffe Colonel Ritter to travel on the airship as its security officer. There are many passengers on board - a German countess, a circus clown, two card sharks and many others - and Ritter is kept busy keeping an eye on them as well as the crew. When they learn that the person who reported the threat is actually a self-styled psychic, there is some question as to whether they may be chasing shadows. Ritter soon learns otherwise.—garykmcd A fictional account of the events leading to the explosion of the German airship, the Hindenburg, while it was attempting to dock at Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 is presented. Such hydrogen-powered airships, built by Frankfurt-based Zeppelin, are flouted by the Nazis as a symbol of their global power, despite Zeppelin officials largely and openly not being Nazi supporters. Although the Germans have received crank reports of such before, they believe that a letter they receive from Kathie Rauch of Milwaukee stating that a time bomb will explode aboard the Hindenburg while flying over American soil to be genuine in its threat because of the specificity of her claims. As such, the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda, which corroborates that the letter's claims support their own intelligence, employs Luftwaffe Colonel Franz Ritter to act ""quietly"" as chief of security for the next Germany to US flight, when the explosion is to occur. The Nazis do not know that Ritter is not a supporter of their policies, he who would leave the German military if he could, but he does tell them that he believes such airships, even the Hindenburg, to be ""flying dinosaurs"". What the Nazis don't tell him but what he learns once on board is that the Gestapo have also enlisted an operative, Martin Vogel, for that flight, he who is undercover as the staff photographer. Ritter and Vogel are often at odds with each other on the approach to take on the process of identifying and dealing with a bomber. Although Mrs. Rauch is ultimately identified as a crackpot, Ritter does believe that there truly is a bomber on board, based on evidence he and Vogel collect of the disparate group of passengers and the crew, many of who seem to have the ability or motive to blow up the Hindenburg. What Ritter decides to do is based largely on his anti-Nazi feelings, but his actions may be compromised by Vogel's own strong Nazi leanings.—Huggo Nazi Germany's prized airship is threatened with sabotage, so Col. Franz Ritter is charged with its safety. As the massive zeppelin lifts off for a journey to the United States, Ritter investigates the passengers, looking for a potential bomber. Could it be anti-Nazi Countess Ursula von Reugen, suspicious gambler Emilio Pajetta, shifty advertising man Edward Douglas or even the pilot, Capt. Pruss?—Jwelch5742 May, 1937. Kathie Rauch from Milwaukee, Wisconsin sends a letter to the German Embassy in Washington, D.C. claiming the Hindenburg zeppelin will explode after flying over New York. In the meantime, Luftwaffe Colonel Franz Ritter (George C. Scott) boards with the intention of protecting the Hindenburg as various threats have been made to down the airship, which some see as a symbol of Nazi Germany.Ritter is assisted by a Nazi government official, SS/Gestapo Hauptsturmführer Martin Vogel (Roy Thinnes), who poses as official photographer. However, both operate independently in investigating the background of all passengers and crew on the voyage. Ritter has reason to suspect everyone, even his old friend and former mistress, Countess Ursula von Reugen (Anne Bancroft), who vehemently opposes the Nazi regime.Other prime suspects include card sharks Emilio Pajetta (Burgess Meredith) and Major Napier (Rene Auberjonois), Edward Douglas (Gig Young), a suspicious German-American ad executive, as well as several crew members and even the Hindenburg captains Pruss (Charles Durning) and Lehmann (Richard A. Dysart).As the Hindenburg makes its way to Lakehurst Air Field, events conspire against Ritter and Vogel. They soon suspect the rigger Karl Boerth (William Atherton), a former Hitler Youth leader who has become disillusioned with the Nazis. Ritter attempts to arrest him. Boerth resists. He requests help from Ritter, whose son was killed a year before. Boerth's girlfriend, Freda Halle, was killed while trying to escape arrest as the Hindenburg crossed the Atlantic. Boerth, upon hearing the news of Halle's death, plans to commit suicide by staying aboard the airship as the bomb goes off.Ritter eventually agrees with Boerth to set the bomb to detonate at 7:30 p.m., when the airship should have landed and passengers disembarked. While setting up the bomb (a small C-4 plastic explosive), Boerth drops a knife, which was later revealed to have been stolen from Rigger Ludwig Knorr. Vogel starts to work behind Ritter's back, arresting Boerth and confiscating the Countess's passport.As the airship approaches Lakehurst Naval Air Station at 7:00, Ritter now realizes the landing has been delayed and searches for Boerth to ask where the bomb is. Vogel is caught by Ritter torturing Boerth and gets into a fight with Ritter and is knocked unconscious. An injured Boerth tells Ritter the bomb is in the repair patch of gas cell 4. Ritter attempts to defuse the bomb, but is unable to do so in time and is spotted at the last few seconds by a now awakened Vogel. The bomb explodes, killing Ritter instantly and sending Vogel flying down the walkway. Vogel survives, being carried by ground crewmen, while Boerth dies of his burns.At this point the film changes to monochrome in order to match up with the actual newsreel footage of the disaster. Passengers and crew struggle to survive the fire. The disaster scene ends when the camera pans over wreckage, towards a strip of burning fabric that says ""Hindenburg"" on it. The following day, with the fire cleared, a list of passengers who died or survived is described briefly, while the wreckage is examined for the inquiry before being cleaned up.The film ends with a tribute to Herbert Morrison's radio commentary, with the memorable quotation, ""Oh the humanity,"" as the Hindenburg flies once again, only to disappear again in the clouds."

It's 1930. Claire (Liza Minnelli), an American living in Tijuana, Mexico, has just buried her husband Harry, who owned a dive bar there. Walker Ellis (Burt Reynolds), a loser with whom she has long had a thing on the side, agrees to wrap up her affairs in Tijuana for her so that she can move stateside before they be together after an appropriate grieving period. Wrapping up those affairs includes smuggling one last truckload of illegal Mexican immigrants across the border. In that job not going quite according to plan, Walker is forced to go into business rum running across the border with Kibby Womack (Gene Hackman), one of those he was trying to smuggle across the border, Kibby an American in trouble with Uncle Sam. Instead of via overland, Walker has hired Billy Mason (Robby Benson) to Captain the sailboat to transport the goods via water, Billy a young, quiet man unwise to the ways of the world, but wise when it comes to the sea. As Walker, Claire, Kibby, and Billy navigate the waters on this venture, they will find two inherent risks. The first is the U.S. Coast Guard, officious Captain Moseley (Geoffrey Lewis), who patrols these waters. Moseley and the Coast Guard can do nothing if they're in international waters unless there is a sign of illegal cargo or a sale of illegal merchandise. As such, Moseley can usually just ""starve"" rum runners who just sail up and down the coast unable to dock in a U.S. port. And second is other rum runners.

But where do these kids really call home? Tia and Tony are two orphaned youngsters with extraordinary powers. Lucas Deranian poses as their uncle in order to get the kids into the clutches of Deranian's megalomanical boss, evil millionaire Aristotle Bolt, who wants to exploit them. Jason, a cynical widower, helps Tia and Tony ""escape to witch mountain,"" while at the same time Tia and Tony help Jason escape the pain of the loss of his wife.—Adam Chotiner <achot@mindspring.com> Blessed with unusual psychokinetic powers, the young siblings, ten-year-old, Tia, and her twelve-year-old brother, Tony, find themselves in an orphanage, suffering from amnesia. But, before long, their extraordinary gifts will draw the attention of the greedy millionaire, Aristotle Bolt, who wants to profit from Tia and Tony by taking control of their special powers. Now, the teens are in the clutches of the unstoppable megalomaniac, and their only chance at freedom lies in the hands of the sceptical camper, Jason O'Day, and a strange, forgotten place. Can they find the answers they seek in the heart of the mystical Witch Mountain?—Nick Riganas As the film opens, two young children are being brought to a beautiful orphanage in the countryside of California. The kids, named Tony Malone and his younger sister Tia, are warmly welcomed by the home's proprietor Mrs. Grindley, but make fast enemies with local bully, Truck. The children explain to Mrs. Grindley their background; when they were very small, they were adopted by an older couple named Mr. and Mrs. Malone. They have no memory of their parents, or really anything before being taken in by the Malones, though Tia has carried around a small box with two stars emblazoned on it for years, her ""star case"", and occasionally has obscure memory flashes to some kind of accident. Now that both of their adoptive parents have died, the pair have been sent to live in the orphanage.
Tony makes friends playing softball, while Tia befriends a black cat, which they name Winkie. While playing baseball, Tony makes an incredible leap to catch the ball and strike Truck out. Truck accuses Tony of cheating, and attempts to beat him up, but Tony stops him by making a baseball glove punch Truck, and levitating a bat so Truck strikes it and hurts his hand, while Tia looks at Tony with disapproval. The other kids stare at the pair, and Tia telepathically chastises Tony for showing off. That night in bed, Tia reminds Tony how they were looked upon as freaks by the other kids back in their old home, and even feared by the community until they stopped doing the ""spooky stuff"". The kids also realize that they can hear ""the dogs"" barking again, from miles away. They take this as an ill omen for times to come.
Some time later, all the children are awaiting a bus to go see a movie in town. Truck steals Tia's star case and threatens to destroy it unless Tony fights him for it, though Winkie knocks it out of Truck's hands and defuses the situation as the bus arrives. After the movie, Tia has a premonition of danger involving a man about to get into his car across the street. They separate from the group to warn him, and are collected by Mrs. Grindley. The man, named Mr. Deranian, decides to go for a walk instead, and moments later his car is plowed into by a runaway truck, exactly where Deranian would have been sitting. He stares in awe as the children leave.
Deranian returns to his employer, Aristotle Bolt, a millionaire who is obsessed with finding supernatural means of expanding his wealth. Deranian tells him of his encounter, and Bolt tells him to bring the children to him.
Tony is playing his harmonica to draw a picture of a place he's been having visions about. Tia walks in to show him her damaged star case, but while inspecting it, they find the front panel slides away to reveal a map to a unknown location, and landmarks ""Stony Creek"", and ""Misty Valley"". They determine to find their way there someday, as it may hold a clue to their past. Tia then notices the picture Tony is drawing, and they say that since they've never seen the mansion in the picture before, they must be going to it soon.
Deranian researches the two after finding out their names from the orphanage, and forges many documents, which he uses to prove to Mrs. Grindley that he is, in fact, Tony and Tia's uncle Lucas, claiming that he recognized Tia as looking like his sister. Tony and Tia are skeptical, but have no choice but to go with Deranian.
Dernanian takes the two far into the country, to Mr. Bolt's vast and gorgeous estate on the coast. As they drive in, they pass the gate guard, Loco, who has a severe allergic reaction on proximity to Winkie, and large kennels filled with guard dogs, that both Tia and Tony recognize as the source of the barking they heard before. Mr. Bolt plays the part of the gracious host, giving the children lavish living quarters as well as keeping them busy with a number of activities. During a riding lesson, Tia speaks to and rides a wild horse named Thunderhead, as the instructor looks on dumbfounded. Later, Tony uses his harmonica to make the marionettes in their room dance on their own. Little do they know that Mr. Bolt has been recording them on the CCTV cameras installed all over the property, intending to blackmail the children using the tapes.
One night, Tony notices Tia seems upset. Although she is unable to pinpoint why, as they seem to have gotten everything they've ever wanted. Tony admits to also feeling as if something is wrong. Tia tells Tony that she has had visions of Bolt turning on them and never letting them leave, and tells him they should consider running away. Tony reluctantly agrees.
While having dinner with Mr. Bolt and Deranian, Bolt runs out of patience and reveals to the children that he knows about their powers, against Deranian's advice. Tony and Tia feign ignorance, but can tell he isn't lying. Bolt tells them he wants to understand their powers, and use them to help his business efforts. The two tell him that he is not thinking clearly and needs some rest, and he leaves with Deranian. Tony and Tia are shaken at the revelation, and discuss what to do. Telepathically, they hear Bolt talking to Deranian, saying that if the children don't cooperate, he will have them sent to a secluded island in the middle of a freezing ocean to prevent them from escaping. Tia and Tony decide to run away that night, and try to find their way to the place on the star case map.
After they are 'asleep', and Deranian locks their bedroom door for the night, they put their plan into action. Fully dressed and ready to go, they take Winkie, and Tia unlocks the door with ease. They take a back door out of the mansion and make it outside before alarms begin to blare throughout the compound and the dogs are set loose. They run and make it as far as the gate before the dogs catch up, but Tia empathically tells them to chase their handlers instead, then calls Thunderhead to their aid. Tony tries to use his harmonica to open the gate, but Loco is holding it closed. Winkie jumps into the guard booth, causing Loco to sneeze uncontrollably and release the gate lever. Tony opens the gate, and they all get away on Thunderhead.
Bolt is furious, and asserts all of his power in the area to find the children, including state police. The kids make it to town, and see a Winnebago Motor Home parked outside a store. They hide inside the RV as the crotchety driver, Jason O'Day, loads up to leave for a road trip. Deranian drives by and asks Jason if he has seen the runaways, but Jason tells him to shove off, and drives the RV away.
The next morning, Jason pulls into a beach and gets out to stretch his legs. Winkie finds her way out, knocking a bag of flour onto the children as she does. Jason finds Winkie and takes a liking to her, but when he goes inside the RV to get tuna, he finds Tony and Tia hiding inside. He evicts them from his RV, but takes pity on them and tells them to clean up while he makes them some food. Tia tells Tony that despite his grouchy attitude and professed dislike of kids, she can tell he is a good person.
State Police all over are searching for the children, and Deranian suspects that they might be hiding in the Winnebago he saw the previous night. They begin to search for the RV specifically.
The kids explain their situation to Jason, who is skeptical. When Jason realizes he's lost his keys, they prove their powers to him by starting his engine without them, and having Winkie find his keys on the beach. In exchange, they convince him to take them to Stony Creek.
Jason takes the RV to a gas station for supplies, but the pump attendant is acting suspicious. They leave, and when the children take note of how many provisions Jason got, he tells them the trip might not be as straight forward as they hope, as Bolt is an extremely powerful man in these parts. Just then a State Trooper on motorcycle shows up on their tail, tipped off by the gas station attendant. He pulls them over and gets off his bike, but before he can approach the Winnebago, Tony telekenetically sends his cycle over the cliff, and they drive away. Tia's memory flashes of the accident they were in when the Malones took them in have been becoming more frequent. They become clear enough for he to tell that it had something to do with the ocean, and a trawler like Mr. Malone had.
Mr. Bolt calls the Sheriff of a town called Longview, and tells him a reward has been offered for the children's capture, and to be on the lookout as the RV has been seen heading that direction.
The group stops for the night in a secluded campground. Jason is becoming fond of the children, and helps them decipher the landmarks on their map. The kids suspect that the place in the mountains might be where they came from, though Tia has a feeling that it was further away then that. Jason and the kids wonder why whoever gave them the star case would hide the map so well. Jason mentions in passing that he never married, but Tia reveals that to be false, stunning Jason. Both children explain that they can see from his mind his life before, how when he was a young man, he married a beautiful woman who died just a few months after they were wed, leaving Jason in despair. He swore an oath never to love anyone ever again, hence his outwardly gruff demeanor. Jason is momentarily upset at these old memories, and the children apologize for prying.
In the middle of the night, Deranian and his driver Ubermann are coming the area and spot the RV in the woods. they attempt to sneak up on them, gun drawn, but Winkie hears them coming and knocks the gun from Ubermann's hand, waking the group. Tia telekenetically holds the gun on Deranian and Ubermann, while Jason starts the RV and drives away. Deranian gives chase, and Jason tells Tony and Tia to jump out at the next town, Longview, to split up and lose their pursuers. He tells them to meet him at his brother's house outside of town. They turn a corner and Tony and Tia jump out of the RV and run another direction, while Deranian's car follows Jason. Tia and Tony make their way through the town in the dark, but are ambushed by the Sheriff, who witnessed the ruse.
He takes them to the station and confiscates their items, but when he takes down their names, Tony instinctively answers with the last name ""Castaway"", confusing himself and Tia. The Sheriff locks them up as runaways, and Tia says she thinks Tony said Castaway as a translation from another language, perhaps their original last name. Tia remembers a man named Uncle Bene was with them when they wrecked. He gave Tia the star case, but drowned while keeping them afloat. They hear the Sheriff tell his deputy that Deranian is on his way to collect to children, and Tony asks Tia to levitate his harmonica to him. They easily unlock the cell door, and Tony telekenetically makes a figure out of a broom handle, trench coat, and hat to attack the Sheriff as a distraction. They grab to star case and escape to the woods, but not before Tia frees a caged circus bear that she says needed her help. The terrified Sheriff rallies the townsmen to hunt down the pair, claiming that they are witches. Deranian arrives in the middle of the chaos and is worried the bloodthirsty townsfolk will kill the children.
Tia and Tony meanwhile, have made it to the forest. They tell the bear to hide in a cave while they make their way to Jason's brother's house. The townsmen search the cave looking for the kids, but the bear scares them away. The kids finally make it to the house and meet up with Jason and Winkie, but Deranian and Ubermann are on their trail and radio Bolt.
Tia and Tony fill Jason in on what they've remembered so far. They both remember that they are supposed to find someone named Castaway in Stony Creek. They realize the accident must have been on a ship from another country, since they didn't understand English when the Malones adopted them. But they can't remember where the ship could have come from. Jason his brother wrote to him in his letters about a group of people who had settled into a secluded place called Witch Mountain, above Stony Creek. The people there keep to themselves, and no one knows where they came from. Tony and Tia figure that they must be their people. Bolt leaves via helicopter to join the Deranian at the house.
The group sees Deranian and Ubermann approaching, and leave via the back door while Tia telepathically asks the bear for help. They drive off and Deranian attempts to follow, but finds the bear sitting in his car.
While driving, Tia and Tony remember more details about their past. The night their ship sank, many other people died as well as their uncle Bene. There were multiple ships however, and the survivors made it to their destination on Witch Mountain. They all fled there from a place that doesn't exist anymore, hence why they call themselves 'Castaways'. The two stars on the star case was the emblem of their old home, a place with two suns in the sky. Not another country, but in fact an entirely different planet, in another solar system. All the pieces of memory finally fit together. Their world was dying, and the remaining population boarded spaceships to escape and find a new home. Tony and Tia's ship got caught in a storm and was destroyed, and Uncle Bene helped the children survive long enough to be rescued by the Malones, who took them in. They suspect that they are the only ones on their spaceship who made it.
Bolt arrives in his helicopter to the house, which scare the bear away. Deranian explains the situation to Bolt, and goes to follow the RV.
Jason and the kids arrive in Stony Creek, but the town seems deserted. They go to a building marked Misty Valley Cooprative, and decide to wait for someone to come back.
Deranian finds the search party from Longview, and tells them the reward for the children as gone up, but they must be caught alive. One of the searchers suggests they look in the next town up the line; Stony Creek.
Jason and the kids are getting restless waiting, and Tony suddenly has a feeling to check the phone book. He looks up the name Castaway and dials the number. The man on the other end of the phone rejoices when he hears Tony and Tia's names, but just then Deranian arrives with the townsmen.
The voice on the phone tells Tony to take the back door, which they do. Once outside, the children hear the voice again, this time telepathically, telling them to make sure Deranian doesn't lose them, as he has a surprise waiting for him that will discourage him and Bolt from ever looking for them again. A chase ensues up the mountain, and the kids manage to hold of some of their pursuers. Deranian takes a shortcut and attempts to head them off, but somehow the RV flies into the air right over him. The force making this happen also makes Bolt's helicopter fly upside down next to them, which flabbergasts Bolt. The RV comes to a landing on Witch Mountain, and the voice tells the group to get out and wait.
The kids thank Jason for all he's done, and say goodbye. Jason has become very fond of them, and asks if he could think of them as the kids he never had. Tia also asks him to take Winkie, since Jason needs a companion. The source of the voice emerges from the treeline, and the children recognize the man as their uncle Bene; he'd apparently not drowned in the storm, but survived after empathically asking a passing shark for help. Bene praises Jason as a credit to his species, and explains that there were other young survivors that are still missing, all with star cases and maps. So far, only Tony and Tia have made it. Jason vows to try and find the other surviving children and bring them home. Deranian arrives in his car, and Bolt's helicopter comes to a landing, still upside down. Bene tells them it's time to go. They children bid farewell to Jason and go with Bene. They board a flying saucer, which takes off in front of Bolt, out of his reach forever. He and Deranian leave defeated.
After Bolt leaves, the spaceship comes back and flies over Jason and Winkie into the Misty Valley of Witch Mountain to join the colony."

They are interrupted when Tom Colt (David Janssen), a middle-aged, alcoholic famous writer, staggers to the table and demands to fight Mike for making a lousy movie out of his book, but Mike declines the offer. Later, when Tom and his friend, Hugh Richardson (Gary Conway), offer to buy January and Linda a drink, Linda invites them to her apartment. Hugh leaves, but Tom is game.At the apartment, January excuses herself so Linda and Tom can be alone. As Linda slips into her lingerie, Tom sneaks out the fire escape and goes to Januarys, where he apologizes for treating Mike so rudely. January kisses him, and tells him to call her when he is sober. Hours later, he calls to say he is sober. January and Tom begin dating.One night, she goes to Tom's hotel and realizes it is the same suite her father always rented when she came home from boarding school. She tries to seduce Tom, but he wants to wait until they are not in the room that January was raised in. Later, when January tells Mike about Tom, he begs her not to date older men like himself and reminds her that Tom is married with a six-month old baby. January goes to Linda for advice, who theorizes that January's hang ups are due to her oedipal cravings and suggests she sleep with Mike to get it out of her system.That weekend, Tom and January visit the Hamptons and, after they make love, Tom confesses he has been impotent for years and his wife was impregnated by artificial insemination. Tom explains his wife and he have their freedom, as long as they are discrete. The next morning, Tom gets an offer to go to Hollywood, California to adapt one of his books into a screenplay. He asks January to accompany him, but she has promised Mike she would go with him to Palm Beach, Florida. Tom talks her into telling Mike she is writing a story on Tom, and has to go to the west coast.A few days later, Mike arrives in California to find Tom and January in bed. Mike beats up Tom, and gives January 30 minutes to pack; but Tom tells January that, if she goes, she can never come back. Mike returns to Palm Beach alone and asks Deidre for a divorce, explaining that when he married her, he lost his daughter. Deidre complains she will be all alone, but Mike notes that she has Karla and that he is returning January's trust fund money to her. The two decide to split on friendly terms and board a plane to New York, however, the plane crashes (off-camera) killing both of them.After the funeral, January learns Tom is in New York. She finds him in a bar, where he explains he is breaking up with January because he is old and regrets getting between her and her father. Tom acknowledges they had something special once, but January pleads that once is not enough. Tom asks her to leave. January returns to her apartment and finds Linda in hysterics because, after sleeping with her boss, he fired her. January calms her down and gets her to bed, then wanders the New York City streets all night, thinking of Tom and Mike. In the final shot, January sits down on a bench and watches the dawn as it slowly rises over the George Washington Bridge, aware that this will be a brand new and hope-full new day."

Nashville,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073440/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Over the course of a few hectic days, numerous interrelated people prepare for a political convention. Five days in the Nashville country and gospel music scene, filled with stars, wannabe stars, and other hangers-on - individual stories of this small group intertwined - provides a commentary on American society. The stars include: good ol' boy Haven Hamilton, whose patriotic songs leading up to the American bicentennial belie his controlling and ruthless nature; Barbara Jean, the country music darling who is just returning to Nashville and performing following recovery from a fire-related injury which may have taken more of an emotional toll than a physical one; and good looking and charismatic Tom Frank, one-third of the successful group Bill, Mary, and Tom, he who is trying to go solo, which masks his need to not be solo in his personal life as he emotionally abuses woman after woman in love with him, including Mary who is married to Bill. The wannabe stars include: Albuquerque, whose real name is Winifred, who is trying to run away from her husband Star in he not approving of her career choice; and Sueleen Gay, a waitress who will do anything to make it big in music despite being told directly that she has no singing talent. Tying their stories together are: Opal, a supposed reporter for the BBC who is working on a documentary and is searching for whatever angle she can; John Triplette, a Yankee in town to organize political fundraisers, including a country music outdoor concert, for third party (the Replacement Party) presidential candidate, populist Hal Phillip Walker, who has the potential to take just enough votes to affect the election; and Martha, who has renamed herself L.A. Jones, who is in town to visit her hospitalized ailing aunt, but who instead decides to be a groupie to any country music star she can find.—Huggo This movie tells the intersecting stories of various people connected to the music business in Nashville. Barbara Jean is the reigning queen of Nashville but is near collapse. Linnea and Delbert Reese have a shaky marriage and 2 deaf children. Opal is a British journalist touring the area. These and other stories come together in a dramatic climax.—Reid Gagle A visual and aural mosaic of a film, delivering an accurate, warts-and-all portrait of America on its Bicentennial birthday.—Carl Schultz In the wake of JFK's assassination, under the shadow of the Vietnam war, an independent presidential candidate is running, bold and cheap, under the banner of the Replacement Party: their unbelievable platform includes banning lawyers from Congress and re-writing the national anthem. This uncanny Perot-like figure is never seen, but his campaign wagon blares out rambling, pre-recorded speeches as it lumbers through the film unnoticed. The backdrop is Music City, the characters a myriad and hero- less cross-section of America. The lone foreigner is an insufferable reporter from BBC whose aimless monologues provide satirical counterpoint to the film's deadpan delivery.—Matthew Brandabur <fenris@mcs.com> The overarching plot takes place over five days leading up to a political rally for Replacement Party candidate Hal Phillip Walker, who is never seen throughout the entire movie. The story follows 24 characters roaming around Nashville, in search of some sort of goal through their own (often overlapping) story arcs.Day OneThe film opens with a campaign van for presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker driving around Nashville as an external loudspeaker blares Walker's folksy political aphorisms and vaguely anti-establishment populism. This is juxtaposed with country superstar Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson) recording an overblown patriotic song (""200 Years"") intended to commemorate the upcoming Bicentennial, and growing irritated with the accompanying musicians in the studio. A young Englishwoman named Opal (Geraldine Chaplin), who claims to be working on a radio documentary for the BBC, appears in the studio but is told to leave by Haven. Down the hall from Haven's session is Linnea Reese (Lily Tomlin), a white gospel singer recording a song with a black choir.Later that day, the beloved country singer Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley) is returning to Nashville, having recovered from a burn accident, and the elite of Nashville's music scene, including Haven Hamilton and his companion Lady Pearl (Barbara Baxley), have converged on Berry Field to greet her plane as it arrives. Also present are Pfc. Glenn Kelly (Scott Glenn) and the folk/rock trio ""Bill, Mary, and Tom"" whose catchy hit song ""It Don't Worry Me"" seems to be on everybody's lips. They are in town to record their second album. Bill (Allan F. Nicholls) and Mary (Cristina Raines) are married, but largely unhappy, partly due to the fact that Mary is in love with womanizing Tom (Keith Carradine).Meanwhile, Mr. Green (Keenan Wynn) arrives at the airport to pick up his niece, Martha (Shelley Duvall), who has renamed herself ""L.A. Joan"", a teenage groupie who has come to Nashville ostensibly to visit her aunt Esther Green who is sick in the hospital. However, Martha repeatedly puts off visiting her aunt in favor of chasing after musicians or pretty much any male she comes across, including the oddball motorcyclist known as ""Tricycle Man,"" (Jeff Goldblum). Working at the airport restaurant are African-American cook Wade Cooley (Robert DoQui), and his pretty waitress friend, Sueleen Gay (Gwen Welles), an aspiring country singer who refuses to recognize that she can't carry a tune.After greeting the crowds on the tarmac, Barbara Jean faints due to the heat, and her handlers, headed by her domineering husband-manager Barnett (Allen Garfield), rush her to the hospital. Barbara Jean's appearance having been cut short, those in attendance depart the airport in a rush, and wind up stranded on the highway after a pile-up occurs. During the commotion, Winifred (Barbara Harris), an aspiring country singer who has chosen the stage name ""Albuquerque,"" runs away from her husband, Star (Bert Remsen), after he refuses to take her to the Grand Ole Opry. Star gives a ride to Kenny Frasier (David Hayward), a nondescript, bespectacled young man who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview first Linnea and then Tommy Brown (Timothy Brown), an African-American country singer who is performing at the Opry. Tommy and his entourage later go to Lady Pearl's nightclub, but Wade, who is drinking and trying to pick up white girls at the bar, insults Tommy for acting too ""white"" and starts a fight.Linnea's husband, Del Reese (Ned Beatty) is working with political organizer John Triplette (Michael Murphy) to plan a small fundraiser and a large outdoor concert gala for the Walker campaign. Sueleen appears at a local club's open mike night in a provocative outfit, and despite her lack of singing ability, club manager Trout (Merle Kilgore) recommends her to Triplette for the fundraiser based on her appearance. Winifred shows up at Trout's club trying to recruit musicians to record a demo with her, but Star sees her and chases her out. Del invites Triplette for a family dinner with Linnea and their two deaf children. Linnea and Del are having communications problems and she focuses on the children rather than on him. In the middle of dinner, Tom calls trying to make a date with Linnea, but she puts him off, so he takes Opal back to his room instead. Pfc. Kelly sneaks into Barbara Jean's hospital room and sits in the chair by her bed all night, watching her sleep.Day TwoTom calls Linnea again but, with Del listening on the other line, Linnea yells at Tom and tells him not to call her any more. Kenny rents a room from Mr. Green. Haven Hamilton throws a pre-show party at his house before the evening's Grand Ole Opry performance. At the party, Opal talks to Haven's son Bud (Dave Peel) who tells her, unconvincingly, that he is happy to act as his father's business manager and has no musical ambitions of his own. Under Opal's prodding, Bud starts to sing her a song he wrote, a tender love ballad, but Opal departs in a rush when she spots a movie star among the guests. Lady Pearl talks about her love for John and Bobby Kennedy, the only politicians she ever admired. Triplette tries to persuade Haven to perform at the Walker gala by telling him that if Walker is elected, Walker would back Haven for Governor of Tennessee. Haven says he'll give Triplette his decision after the Opry show that night.At Opryland USA, the Grand Ole Opry broadcast begins with Tommy Brown (""Bluebird"") and Haven Hamilton (""For the Sake of the Children"", ""Keep a-Goin""). Haven then introduces Connie White (Karen Black) as a substitute for the hospitalized Barbara Jean. Connie sings ""Memphis"" and ""I Don't Know If I Found It in You"" while Barbara Jean and Barnett listen morosely on the radio in her hospital room. Winifred tries unsuccessfully to get backstage. Barbara Jean and Barnett have an argument because he is going to the after-show gathering to thank Connie for substituting at the last minute. Barbara Jean doesn't want him to go, and he suggests in an accusatory tone that she may be headed for another nervous breakdown. Barnett finally calms down Barbara Jean and goes to the after-party at a nightclub, but Connie doesn't seem happy to see him. Connie takes the stage (""Rolling Stone"") but the disgruntled Barnett criticizes her performance. Lady Pearl regales Opal with stories about the Kennedy brothers, rendering Opal for once speechless. Haven tells Triplette that Barbara Jean and Connie never appear on the same stage, and that he (Haven) will appear anyplace Barbara Jean also appears. Bill gets upset when his wife Mary doesn't show up all evening, and he confesses to chauffeur Norman (David Arkin), that he suspects her of having an affair. Mary, in bed with Tom, keeps whispering ""I Love You,"" but Tom doesn't respond.Day ThreeIt is Sunday morning and the characters are shown attending various local church services. A Roman Catholic service includes Lady Pearl, Wade and Sueleen; Haven Hamilton sings in the choir at a Protestant service; and Linnea is seen in the choir at a black Protestant church as a baptism is taking place, with Tommy Brown in the pews. At the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings a hymn from her wheelchair while Mr. Green and Pfc. Kelly, among others, watch. Mr. Green tells Kelly how he and his wife lost their son in WWII. Opal wanders alone through a huge auto scrap yard making free-form poetic speeches about the cars into her tape recorder. Haven, Tommy Brown and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred attempts to sing on a small stage but cannot be heard over the cars. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who wants to recruit them for the Walker concert gala. Tom tries to get Norman to score him some pills.Day FourOpal walks alone through a large school bus parking lot trying to spin a commentary linking the buses to racism in the South, but has trouble hitting the right note. Barbara Jean is discharged from the hospital at the same time Mr. Green shows up to visit his sick wife. Barbara Jean asks after Mrs. Green and sends her regards. After Barbara Jean and her entourage have left, a nurse tells Mr. Green his wife died earlier that morning. Pfc. Kelly tells Mr. Green why he has been following Barbara Jean around; his mother saved Barbara Jean's life in the fire and loved her more than anything. She asked her son to go see Barbara Jean on his leave from Vietnam service. Back at Mr. Green's house, Kenny gets upset when Martha tries to look at his violin case.Barbara Jean performs a matinee at Opryland USA. Triplette and Del attend and try to convince Barnett to have Barbara Jean play the Walker concert gala at the Parthenon the next day, but he refuses. Kenny and Pfc. Kelly are both in the audience and watch raptly as Barbara Jean sings, although Opal annoyingly tries to interview Kelly about Vietnam during a song. Barbara Jean gets through the first couple of songs (""Tapedeck in his Tractor"", ""Dues"") all right, but then begins to tell rambling stories about her childhood instead of starting the next song. After several false starts, Barnett escorts her from the stage and tells the disappointed audience that they can come to the Parthenon tomorrow and see Barbara Jean perform for free, thus committing her to the Walker concert.Tom calls Linnea and invites her to meet him that night at a club called the Exit Inn. Linnea arrives but sits by herself because Martha is trying to pick up Tom. Mary and Bill are also there, and Opal sits with them and mentions that she slept with Tom, causing Mary to look away in humiliation. Wade tries unsuccessfully to pick up Linnea, while Norman tries equally unsuccessfully to pick up Opal. Tom is introduced as a surprise guest artist. He casually mentions that he ""used to be in a trio,"" but then invites Bill and Mary up to the stage, where the three perform an uncomfortable rendition of ""Since You're Gone"". Again alone on the stage, Tom introduces his new solo number, ""I'm Easy,"" which he dedicates to someone special in the audience. Mary, Opal, and Martha all hope that they are the one, but Tom only has eyes for Linnea. She goes to his room where they make love. When Linnea says she has to go, Tom begs her to stay another hour, and is visibly miffed when she refuses. Without even waiting for her to get dressed and leave, Tom grabs the phone and calls a girlfriend in New York, inviting her to fly down and join him.Sueleen appears at the all-male Walker fundraiser, but is booed off the stage when she sings poorly and doesn't take off her clothes. Del and Triplette explain to her that the men expect her to strip and that if she does so, they will let her sing the next day at the Parthenon with Barbara Jean. Sueleen is humiliated, but strips anyway. Winifred shows up at the fundraiser hoping to get a chance to sing, but after she sees what is going on, she stays hidden behind a curtain. Del drives Sueleen home and drunkenly comes on to her, but she is rescued by Wade. After he hears what happened, Wade tells Sueleen the truth, that she can't sing, and asks her to go back to Detroit with him the next day. Sueleen refuses because she is determined to sing at the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.Day FiveThe performers, audience and Walker and his entourage arrive for the Parthenon concert; Walker will wait in his limousine until his speech after the musical performances. In the performing lineup are Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Bill, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen. Winifred has shown up again hoping for a chance to sing. Barnett gets upset because Barbara Jean will have to perform in front of a large Walker advertisement, but has to go along with it because his wife's career will be harmed if he pulls her out of another show. Mr. Green and Kenny attend Esther Green's burial service and Mr. Green leaves angrily, vowing to find Martha (who is not at the service) and make her show some respect to her aunt. Mr. Green and Kenny go to the Parthenon to look for Martha.The Walker gala starts and Haven and Barbara Jean perform a song together (""One, I Love You""), then Barbara Jean sings a very personal solo song about her childhood (""My Idaho Home""). As the song ends, gunshots are heard. Kenny has pulled a gun from his violin case and fired at the performers, grazing Haven and seriously wounding Barbara Jean. Pfc. Kelly disarms Kenny as chaos breaks out. Barbara Jean is carried bleeding and unconscious from the stage. Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that ""This isn't Dallas, this is Nashville"" in reference to the JFK assassination. As he is led from the stage for treatment of his wounds, Haven hands the microphone off to Winifred, who tentatively begins to sing ""It Don't Worry Me."" As she is joined by Linnea's gospel choir, Winifred's confidence grows until all eyes are upon her. The film ends with the audience clapping and dancing as Winifred belts out the chorus, ""You may say that I'm not free, but it don't worry me."" She has finally gotten her big break."
Race with the Devil,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073600/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two couples vacationing together in an R.V. from Texas to Colorado are terrorized after they witness a murder during a Satanic ritual. Frank and Roger and their wives take off for Colorado in a recreational vehicle, looking forward to some skiing and dirt biking. While camping en route, they witness a Satanic ritual sacrifice, but the local sheriff finds no evidence to support their claims and urges them to continue on their vacation. On the way, however, they find themselves repeatedly attacked by cult members, and they take measures to defend themselves.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> Motorcycle shop owner and retired racer, Frank Stewart (Warren Oates), meets his friend, Roger Marsh (Peter Fonda), at a motorbike racetrack after Roger completes a test circuit with disappointing results. Their wives, Alice Stewart (Loretta Swit) and Kelly Marsh (Lara Parker), step out of Frank's new R.V. at the track and Alice encourages the crew to hit the road for their much anticipated ski vacation.After heading out of San Antonio and finding a peaceful, isolated location off the highway to set up camp, Roger and Frank race their motorbikes while Kelly and Alice take the Marsh's dog, Ginger, for a walk. When the dog exhibits nervous behavior, Kelly surveys the landscape with suspicion. The couples share a lively dinner, but Ginger continues to be anxious.Later, as Roger and Frank sit outside drinking and reminiscing, they see a congregation of chanting, robed figures beside a bonfire in the distance. Upon further investigation with binoculars, Roger and Frank conclude that they are watching an orgy. The revelry becomes violent, however, and the two men witness an occult ritual where a masked leader sacrifices a naked young woman by stabbing her through the heart. When Alice calls to Roger and Frank from the R.V., she unknowingly reveals them to the cultists, who chase after the men.After making their way back to the R.V., Roger and Frank tell their wives they witnessed a murder. As they attempt to drive away, the wheels become stuck in a river. Roger and Frank are able to push the R.V. free, but two men from the cult gain on them and smash the back window with logs as Roger fights them off.The next morning, the four vacationers stop at a police station in a small town and report their encounter to Sheriff Taylor (R.G. Armstrong), who insists that Roger and Frank return with him to the scene of the ritual. On the way, Taylor explains that drug-addicted hippies have destroyed the serenity of the area, and that he recently caught them skinning cats and smearing blood on their naked bodies, claiming to have seen the devil. When the police sweep the scene, they find evidence of a bonfire and bloodstains, but no discernible footprints. Although Frank discovers a sacrificed dog hanging on a tree, Taylor blames the incident on vagrants and suggests that the blood at the campsite belonged to the dog, not a young woman as Roger and Frank claim.Back in town, Kelly and Alice find a threatening note, written in English and Rune symbols, attached to the back window of the R.V. warning that any evil caused by the two couples will be returned nine fold. As Kelly and Alice leave the R.V. to find a library so they can decipher its symbols, a man watches them from a red pickup truck. After looking through texts on witchcraft, occult rituals, and the supernatural, Kelly and Alice discover that the books are non-circulating reference materials and steal them.Meanwhile, Sheriff Taylor tells the men to go on their way and leave the case to him, then directs them to a mechanic on the outskirts of town to have the back window repaired. The red pickup pulls into the station as the mechanic works on the window, overhearing the conversation in the motor home. Roger points out that the deputy knew exactly where the site of the ritual was without asking.As Kelly and Alice review full moon ceremonies from their books, Alice shows Frank the note and explains that the rune within it is a spell with Satanic powers. Roger then announces that he secretly took a blood sample from the scene of the ritual. He suggests that they find a police department in a big city and have the evidence analyzed to confirm if it came from a human or a dog.Back out on the road toward Amarillo, the couples reach an R.V. campground for the night and Kelly and Alice go to the pool while Roger and Frank relax with martinis. While swimming, Kelly and Alice receive menacing stares. Sensing that something is still amiss, Kelly returns to the R.V. and pleas with Roger to abandon the trip and go home. When Frank insists to Alice that they must continue, Jack and Ethel Henderson step aboard the R.V. and welcome their new neighbors with a pitcher of martini mix. After admiring the vehicle, Jack is adamant that the two couples accompany them to dinner.At a nearby roadhouse, Roger and Frank relate their harrowing encounters to the Hendersons and tell them that they are on their way to Amarillo. When a fight suddenly breaks out among other bar patrons, the Hendersons watch with excitement but their guests return to the campground. Upon approaching the R.V., they find Ginger strung up on the door to the vehicle. As Kelly sobs over her dead dog, neighbors gather to watch, but refuse to respond to Roger and Frank's angry inquiries for a witness.After leaving the park, they discover two enormous rattlesnakes inside the R.V. and Frank crashes into a tree. Frank manages to skewer one of the snakes with a ski pole, while Roger grabs the other and smashes it against the wall. Hysterical with fear, Kelly insists that the men check the R.V. for other dangers, but after determining the vehicle safe, they are unable to leave because the engine is damaged from the collision.The next morning, when Roger buries Ginger and Frank fixes the engine, the two men find that their bikes have been vandalized. At a local store, Frank buys a shotgun and Roger discovers that the phone lines are down.Back on the road, they stop at a gas station, but Roger's attempt at contacting the highway patrol again fails when the payphone is disconnected. As they head toward the main highway, the truck in front of them stops short, forcing them to crash. They soon realize that three vehicles are making a coordinated effort to box them in. Each of the trucks, including the red pickup, are run off the road with the assistance of Frank's shotgun.Further along the road, the R.V. encounters a school bus in flames, but closer inspection reveals that the children are safely playing outside of it. Realizing the scene is a trap, Frank plows through the roadblock, but several men, including the mechanic who replaced their window, leap onto the R.V. Roger fends them off with the shotgun, and climbs atop the vehicle to defend against the other cars in pursuit.Reaching another roadblock, the R.V. is directed down an alternate road. Eventually, they pull off the road to rest for the night because of their damaged headlights. Roger encourages everyone to drink and relax, saying that the horror has ended, when a bonfire ignites outside. A mass of robed cultists, including the Hendersons, Sheriff Taylor and other individuals that the two couples encountered, surround the R.V. while Roger, Frank, Kelly and Alice are paralyzed with terror inside. As the chanting intensifies, Frank's R.V. is encircled in flames."

New York narcotics detective Popeye Doyle follows the trail of the French connection smuggling ring to France where he teams up with the gendarmes to hunt down the ringleader.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> Fanatiical New York narcotics cop Popeye Doyle obsessively pursues his old nemesis, wily old rival drug Alain Charnier, who escaped capture from New York back to his native Mareilles,, but the outcome of the eponymous case. is still to be determined.—jbbooks1961 Picking up two or three years where the first 'French Connection' film left of, New York City police detective James R. ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) is sent to Marseilles, France, to work with the French Sûreté, ostensibly because he is the only policeman who recognizes Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), also known as ""Frog One,"" and Marseilles' ""heroin kingpin,"" who escaped from New York at the end of the previous film. Popeye meets his French counterpart, Inspector Henri Barthélémy (Bernard Fresson), during an anti-drug operation on the waterfront. Barthélémy resents hosting Popeye, whose aggressive, go-at-it-alone tactics resulted in the deaths of two policemen. Furthermore, corruption within the New York Police Department resulted in the disappearance of the heroin Popeye took into custody. Popeye thinks the French police are incompetent and lazy, and he shows open disregard for French culture and language at every turn.Meanwhile, on a Marseilles tour boat, Jacques (Philippe Leotard), one of Charnier's men, secretly pays a Japanese ship captain for smuggling heroin into the city. Elsewhere, Charnier shoots pheasants on his country estate with U.S. General William Brian (Ed Lauter).Later, Popeye accompanies Barthélémy's men on a raid, and when he sees a dark man slipping away, he gives chase and tackles him in the Arab Quarter. Barthélémy's policemen arrive, set the man free, and whisper to Popeye that he is an officer working undercover. However, local criminals cut the man's throat as he walks away.Charnier meets General Brian in a restaurant to discuss heroin shipments, and sees Popeye outside a window.That night, Charnier's men overpower Popeye and take him to the rundown Hotel Colonnades, where the half-conscious Popeye sees the establishment's former name, Hotel de Tanger, written in sidewalk tile. Charnier tells Popeye he will keep him drugged until he confesses what he knows. For the next three weeks, Charnier's men inject Popeye with heroin. At one point, an addicted elderly English woman (Cathleen Nesbitt) steals his watch while she soothes him.Finally, Popeye confesses he was sent to Marseilles because nobody else knows what Charnier looks like. Satisfied, Charnier tells his henchmen to inject him with an overdose and dump him in front of Sûreté headquarters. A police medical team revives Popeye, and Barthélémy locks him in a basement jail cell for weeks to keep his drug habit secret. Popeye endures agonizing withdrawal, but loses his physical addiction.Later, when the policemen drive Popeye around the city to see if he recognizes anything from his captivity, he realizes he was sent to Marseilles as bait to bring Charnier into the open. He begins a regimen of exercise, working out in his hotel room and jogging through the city to regain his strength. When he finds the tiled ""Hotel de Tanger"" sidewalk, Popeye telephones Barthélémy and tells him to bring water.Popeye carries a can of gasoline into the hotel and sets it afire. The police arrive as the inhabitants flee from the building, including one of Popeye's captors. Popeye beats him until he reveals that Charnier has gone to collect a shipment of drugs from a ship from Rotterdam, Holland.Barthélémy, Popeye, and a contingent of policemen hurry to the waterfront, where several of Charnier's men unload large amounts of heroin from a ship in dry dock. Spotting Barthélémy's agents approaching from beneath the ship, the criminals open sluices to let water pour into the dry dock. Policemen arrive in time to save Barthélémy, Popeye, and others from drowning.That night, alone in his room, Popeye contemplates using two small bags of heroin he took from the criminal outside the Colonnades, but after a few moments, he dumps the powder on the floor.Later, Popeye reasons that Charnier and his men did not have time to pay off the Dutch captain because they had to flee the waterfront quickly.For the next few days, the police spy on the ship until the captain walks to a telephone booth and makes a call. Sûreté agents follow him closely and report to Barthélémy that he exchanged air flight bags with an unidentified stranger on a tour boat, but Popeye recognizes him as Jacques. Barthélémy radios Jacques's description to all Sûreté agents, who follow him to a factory where heroin is being converted to a milky liquid and canned as bouillabaisse soup. Police raid the factory and Jacques is killed, but Charnier escapes and boards a bus. Popeye chases him on foot through the slow city traffic. Losing him briefly at a marina, Popeye instinctively follows a yacht as it moves along the edge of the busy port. When Charnier appears on the yacht's deck, Popeye shoots him dead."

Can she find them, or will she be murdered and replaced by RoboJoanna?—Paul Baker <bakerjp@unix.lancs.ac.uk> Joanna Eberhart (Katharine Ross) is a young wife who moves with her husband Walter (Peter Masterson) and two children from New York City to the idyllic Connecticut suburb of Stepford. Loneliness quickly sets in as Joanna, a mildly rebellious aspiring photographer, finds the women in town all look great and are obsessed with housework, but have few intellectual interests. The men all belong to the clubbish Stepford Men's Association, which Walter joins to Joanna's dismay. Neighbor Carol Van Sant's (Nanette Newman) sexually submissive behavior to her husband Ted, and her odd, repetitive behavior after a car accident also strike Joanna as unusual.Things start to look up when she makes friends with another newcomer to town, sloppy, irrepressible Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss). Along with glossy trophy wife Charmaine Wimperis (Tina Louise), they organize a Women's Lib consciousness raising session, but the meeting is a failure when the other wives hijack the meeting with cleaning concerns. Joanna is also unimpressed by the boorish Men's Club members, including intimidating president Dale ""Dis"" Coba (Patrick O'Neal); stealthily, they collect information on Joanna including her picture, her voice, and other personal details. When Charmaine turns overnight from a languid, self-concerned tennis fan into an industrious, devoted wife, Joanna and Bobbie start investigating, with ever-increasing concern, the reason behind the submissive and bland behavior of the other wives, especially when they learn they were once quite supportive of liberal social policies.Spooked, Bobbie and Joanna start house hunting in other towns, and later, Joanna wins a prestigious contract with a photo gallery with some photographs of their respective children. When she excitedly tells Bobbie her good news, Joanna is shocked to find her freewheeling and liberal friend has abruptly changed into another clean, conservative housewife, with no intention of moving from town.Joanna panics and at the insistence of Walter, visits a psychiatrist where she voices her belief that all the men in the town are behind a conspiracy of somehow changing the women. The psychiatrist recommends she leave town until she feels safe, but when Joanna returns home, the children are missing. The marriage devolves into domestic violence when Joanna and Walter get in to a physical scuffle. In an attempt to find her children, she hypothesizes Bobbie may be caring for them. Joanna, still mystified by Bobbie's behavior, is desperate to prove her humanity but intuitively stabs Bobbie with a kitchen knife. But Bobbie doesn't bleed or suffer, instead going into a loop of odd mechanical behavior, thus revealing she is a robot.Despite feeling she may be the next victim, Joanna sneaks into the mansion which houses the Men's Association to find her children. There, she finds the mastermind of the whole operation, Dale ""Dis"" Coba, and eventually her own robot-duplicate. Joanna is shocked into paralysis when she witnesses its soulless, black, empty eyes. It is then suggested that the Joanna-duplicate strangles the real Joanna. In the final scene, the duplicate is seen placidly purchasing groceries at the local supermarket, along with the other ""wives"" all wearing similar long dresses, large hats and saying little more than hello to each other. The final shot focuses on Joanna's now-finished eyes."

In the year 2000 - against the backdrop of social turmoil, political unrest, and rampant anarchy - a now-totalitarian United Provinces of America supports a brutal annual event to pacify the masses: the infamous Annual Transcontinental Road Race. Scoring points simply by running over unsuspecting pedestrians, the national champion driver Frankenstein has to race against fast contestants such as the beautiful cowgirl killer Calamity Jane; the neo-Nazi Matilda the Hun; the Roman gladiator Nero the Hero, and, first and foremost, the Chicago thug and ambitious challenger Machine Gun Joe. Who will score the most points in the violent Death Race 2000?—Nick Riganas In the near future, United States in a dystopian society that blames France for everything wrong. The government uses the Transcontinental Road Race to entertain the American people, a sort of Big Brother where the runners need to hit and kill pedestrians to score points. In the year 2000, five runners will compete with their navigators the 20th Edition: the champion Frankenstein and his navigator Annie; the ambitious Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, who aims to be the champion anyway; Calamity Jane; Matilda the Hun; and Nero the Hero. Meanwhile, the resistance to the totalitarian regime commanded Thomasina Paine wants to overthrow the government ending the race and using the kidnapping of Frankenstein against the President. Annie is indeed Thomasina's granddaughter and is helping the rebels to abduct Frankenstein.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A champion of a brutal cross-country car race of the future where pedestrians are run down for points has a change of heart while being hounded by rivals and a conspiracy seeking to stop the race.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> In the near future, the ultimate sporting event is the Death Race. Contestants score points by running people down and killing them as they speed across the country. The sport has crazed fans who sacrifice themselves to the drivers. A covert agency is trying to bring an end to the immoral Death Race and has infiltrated one of their followers into the race as a navigator. At the end of the race, the lives of the drivers and Mr. President, as well as the continued existence of the Death Race itself, are in peril.—FMJ_Joker In the dystopian year 2000, the United States has been destroyed by a financial crisis and a military coup. The resulting fascist police state, the United Provinces of America, is headed by the cult figure ""Mr. President"". The people are kept satisfied through a stream of gory gladiatorial entertainment, which includes the bloody spectacle of the Annual Transcontinental Road Race, depicted as a symbol of American values and the American way of life. The coast-to-coast three-day race is run on public roads, and points are scored not just for speed, but for the number of innocent pedestrians struck and killed. Frankenstein is the most celebrated racer and is the government's champion. He is reputed to be part machine, rebuilt after many crashes. He regularly battles with the other teams, particularly ""Machine Gun"" Joe Viterbo, who hates being second. A resistance group led by Thomasina Paine, a lineal descendant of Thomas Paine, one of the original American revolutionaries of the 1770s, is attempting to assassinate Frankenstein and replace him with one of their agents. The ""Resistance"" is assisted by Paine's great-granddaughter Annie, Frankenstein's navigator, who is intending to lure him into a planned ambush where he is to be replaced by a double. Disruption of the race by the Resistance is blamed on the French by the state, who are also blamed for ruining the country's economy and telephone system.It emerges that Frankenstein is not a willing government stooge, nor is there only one Frankenstein. The current Frankenstein is simply one of many people specially trained to race in the role. ""When one is used up, they bring in another,"" he tells Annie. The current Frankenstein also has his own plan to end the tyranny: win the race and shake hands with Mr. President, detonating a grenade which has been implanted in his prosthetic right hand (a ""hand grenade"", as he calls it). Frankenstein successfully outmaneuvers both the rival drivers and the Resistance, and is declared the winner and sole survivor, although he is wounded and unable to carry out his original hand grenade attack plan, as Annie used the grenade to kill Machine Gun Joe Viterbo when he attacks them near the end of the race. Annie dons Frankenstein's disguise and plans to stab Mr. President on the victory podium. Greeting Mr. President as he congratulates Frankenstein, Annie is mistakenly shot and wounded by her grandmother. Frankenstein finally succeeds in killing Mr. President by ramming the podium with his car. In an epilogue, Annie and Frankenstein are wed, and Frankenstein, now President, abolishes the race and the perverse laws of the Provinces, though he does make a point of running over objecting reporter Junior Bruce."
A Boy and His Dog,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072730/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young man and his telepathic dog wander a post-apocalyptic wasteland. A post-apocalyptic tale based on a novella by Harlan Ellison. A boy communicates telepathically with his dog as they scavenge for food and sex, and they stumble into an underground society where the old society is preserved. The daughter of one of the leaders of the community seduces and lures him below, where the citizens have become unable to reproduce because of being underground so long. They use him for impregnation purposes, and then plan to be rid of him.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> Don Johnson plays a young man in a post nuclear war world who has an interesting friend, a telepathic dog. The dog gives him an advantage in dealing with the barbaric world he lives in. When Johnson finds one place that has escaped the devastation of the war, he also finds some rather odd attitudes.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Opening: World War IV lasted five days.In the post-apocalyptic world of 2024, rover Vic (Don Johnson) hears a voice from his dog and communicates with him telepathically. The dog is called Blood (voiced by Tim McIntire). Vic is an 18-year-old boy who was born in and scavenging throughout the desert wasteland of the former southwestern United States. Vic is most concerned with food and sex; having lost both of his parents. He has no formal education and does not understand ethics or morality. He is accompanied by a well-read, misanthropic, telepathic dog named Blood who helps him locate women in return for food. The two steal for a living, evading bands of marauders, berserk androids, and mutants. Blood and Vic have an occasionally antagonistic relationship (Blood frequently annoys Vic by calling him ""Albert"" for reasons never made clear), though they realize they need each other.As they travel, Blood recounts history and quizzes Vic on various topics in history including the four world wars, from World War I (1914-1918), World War II (1939-1945), World War III (1950-1983), which were a series of wars, also called the Cold War, between the free and un-free world (Korea, Vietnam, Indochina, Congo were among them), to World War IV, also called the Five-Day War, or the Nuclear War of 2007. The setting is what was once the ruins in and around Phoenix, Arizona. The area is a desert wasteland, populated by marauders and rovers who battle for food found in the tops of buildings that was once ""civilization"" where the desert sands have consumed most of the buildings. There are rumors that what civilization exists now is below ground for the past several years since the nuclear war. The people of these underground civilizations are called ""downunders"". Neither Vic nor Blood want to venture below to live. Blood finds women for Vic to rape, and Vic supplies Blood with food since he cannot hunt on his own.We learn Blood is a former police dog, and wants to find the ""promised land"" where farming is possible and several above-ground utopias are said to exist. Vic believes that they must make the best of what they have.Blood sniffs out a woman, but rovers have reached her first and have killed her after gang raping her. Vic begins to argue with Blood about his inability to find women. Blood wants to go ""over the hill"" to paradise. Vic promises that they'll go once Blood finds him another woman for Vic to have sex with.Some time later, Vic and Blood view a small group of scavengers, led by a brutal gang leader, a self-proclaimed ""king"" named Fellini (Ron Feinberg), who orders his group to dig up a stash of crates containing canned food. Temped by the food, Vic runs forward when Fellini and his men are all in the hole digging and steals some of the bags of canned food, shooting a few of Fellini's men who chase after him. However, Fellini orders his men to let Vic go, impressed by the young man's courage and ability. As Vic and Blood run away, they are watched from a distance by a small group of mysterious men (unseen from the waist up), where one of whom comments that he just might do. They decide to ""put out the cheese"" to trap Vic.That evening, Vic and Blood go to an outdoor makeshift movie theater in a shantytown camp to watch some vintage stag films, and Blood smells a female. She is in attendance at the stag film, but in disguise as a male solo. Vic follows the girl to an underground building which is an abandoned YMCA, and he watches her change out of her clothing into a woman's dress. He attacks her and orders her to undress so he can rape her. While she undresses for him, she tells him her name is Quilla June Holmes (Susanne Benton). Blood interrupts them to advise of marauders nearby. Quilla realizes Blood can talk to Vic telepathically. She attempts to communicate with the dog, but Blood just barks at her. Meanwhile, Vic ambushes the marauders and Blood joins in, killing some of them. Vic imitates the ""screamers"" (radiation victims) and Blood battles another dog. Vic is about to be shot from behind, and Quilla saves him. The rest of the marauders run off, but Blood is hurt. Then, the real screamers show up, forcing Vic and Quilla to hide and wait in a storage tank. Vic and Quilla make love repeatedly.Later when morning arrives, Blood goes off to see if the screamers have left, and Quilla tries to convince Vic to go ""down under"". Blood wants Vic to leave her, and they argue. When Vic goes back to see Quilla, she knocks him out and flees. Vic decides to track her down, but Blood thinks (rightly) that it's a trap. After following Quilla's footprints through the desert, Vic and Blood come across a small steel obstacle standing in the middle of the desert which leads ""down under"". Using a key card that Quilla left behind, Vic uses it to open the steel door to the underground. Vic goes down under, leaving Blood alone and injured on the surface.Vic climbs down several long ladders through what appears to be an abandoned missile silo, past mysterious machinery, then opens a metal door to find an underground cemetery. He is captured and washed by a clown-faced man dressed in farmer's garb called Michael (Hal Baylor) with several strangers looking on in what appears to be a firehouse.After given clean farmer clothes, Vic is dragged by Michael through a local park, walking past picnickers, giggling young girls, a marching band playing 'Stars and Stripes Forever', and a singing barbershop quartet... all wearing semi-hideous, white clown-face makeup. The population of this underground community apparently wears white clown-faces to distinguish themselves from above-grounders that dare to trespass in their community. Loudspeakers are everywhere, constantly blaring announcements, pontificate morals for daily living, and down home cooking recipes. What we get is a glimpse of is a surreal, bizarre, re-creation of life in the rural Midwest during the early 20th century with a populace of robotic conformists. Vic stops to talk to a small dog similar to Blood. We do not hear the short telepathic conversation between Vic and the other dog, but the dog apparently says something to Vic which makes his happy facial demeanor turn worried and sour. Just then, Michael forcibly takes Vic and the other dog away.In a church/town hall building, residents may attend the weekly ""awards and punishments"" at their own discretion. This down-under community is led by ruthless triumvirate-type of government known as the Committee. The three clownish-looking, but cold-hearted, rulers of this underground town include Lou Craddock (Jason Robards) who reviews blueprints for buildings to be built and harshly passes judgments on transgressors, assisted by his secretary Mez Smith (Helene Winston) and his business partner Doctor Moore (Alvy Moore). Severe judgment (death) is called ""farming out"" or ""going to 3"". We learn the underground town is called Topeka. Quilla arrives, and she asks to be put on the Committee having served her purpose of luring Vic to their underground community. Lou (revealed to be Quilla's stepfather) refuses by claiming that she is too young to rule and arranges for her to get married instead. Quilla leaves and vents her anger to her boyfriend Gary (Michael Rupert) and makes plans to overthrow the ruthless committee, but in the meantime be a good girl and play it safe. At the same time, the dog is brought into the church where he is interrogated by Lou and Doctor Moore asking if he told Vic anything. But when the dog does not respond, Lou angrily orders the dog to be sent to the farm.Vic is brought before Lou, and Doctor Moore reads his medical statistics. Lou tells the unruly Vic that he and the Topeka Committee have been watching him on the surface for days now, and that Vic has been chosen to help re-populate Topeka, as its male residents are sterile and/or impotent due to their ridiculously wholesome, clean, and subterranean living. Vic laughs hysterically, thinking he'll get to sleep with dozens of women. The sinister Topeka Committee laughs back... where Mez Smith hysterically indicates to Vic that sleeping with dozens of women is not what they have in mind.In the next scene, a couple is married in a hospital room, and Vic is in attendance (strapped to a gurney) to provide semen. Quilla arrives and rescues him, subduing the doctors. She tells him he is only going to be allowed to impregnate 35 girls, then will be put to death. They rush out of the hospital with the help of Gary, and find Vic's guns in the church, then Vic starts to leave. Quilla tries to stop him to help her overthrow the dictatorship of Topeka, but Vic has no interest in politics and wants to return to the surface to his dog Blood where he feels at home.The Committee convenes at the town square and begins broadcasting the sentence on Quilla and her friends - the farm. Gary and both of his rebel friends are attacked and killed by Michael who literally crushes their heads with his bare hands. Vic fires at Michael, but the bullets have no effect. One of Vic's gunshots finally disables ""Michael"", who is revealed to be a robot. Vic and Quilla flee while the Committee remains indifferent and begins planning for its next ""donor"". Lou also orders that another Michael security robot be exhumed from the storage warehouse, with his clownish smile wiped off.Vic and Quilla return to the surface where it is now night. Relieved that the Topeka citizens are not chasing after them, they look around and they find Blood nearby, who is dying. But conditions on the surface have become worse with after Blood tells Vic that Fellini and his gang have taken over for the most part. Blood hasn't eaten for days and will die soon unless Vic provides him with food. Quilla tells Vic that it's too late to save Blood and that Vic should come away with her far away if he really loves her. Vic must choose... he looks at Blood, then looks back at Quilla...In the final shot, Vic and Blood are putting out a campfire near the steel dome. Having eaten, Blood feels better and he and Vic (still barefoot and wearing his hospital scrubs) walk away from their campfire into the sunrise of dawn. Quilla is nowhere to be seen, but torn pieces of her white wedding gown are seen strewn around the dying campfire. Vic and Blood talk about how Vic was touched by the fact that Quilla June picked him to be with instead of the dictatorship Committee of Topeka. Blood remarks, ""She had marvelous judgment... if not a particularly good taste (!)"" The boy and his dog laugh at the pun and they both walk away ""over the hill"" toward paradise."

Murder. Marlowe. Mitchum. No one is a saint in the City of Angels. The immortalRobert Mitchumstars asRaymond Chandler's legendary detective Philip Marlowe in the neo-noir mystery Farewell, My Lovely. The hard-boiled Marlowe's latest cases (one, a search for an ex-convict''s lost love, and the other, the murder of a client) take on an even more sinister turn when they begin to connect, leading the private eye deeper and deeper into the seamy underbelly of 1940s Los Angeles. As the stakes are raised and the body count swells, it looks like Marlowe might be next on the list to take the big sleep. Also featuringCharlotte Rampling,Sylvia Miles,Harry Dean Stanton, andSylvester Stallonein an early role, Farewell, My Lovely is an unflinching take on Chandler's pulpy novel and a mystery film as powerful and complex as its leading man. This, the second adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel, is much closer to the source text than the original -Murder, My Sweet (1944), which tended to avoid some of the sleazier parts of the plot - but still concerns private eye Philip Marlowe's attempts to locate Velma, a former dancer at a seedy nightclub and the girlfriend of Moose Malloy, a petty criminal just out of prison. Marlowe finds that once he has taken the case, events conspire to put him in dangerous situations, and he is forced to follow a confusing trail of untruths and double-crosses before he is able to locate Velma.—Mark Thompson <mrt@oasis.icl.co.uk> Los Angeles, 1941In a seedy hotel, private detective Philip Marlowe (Robert Mitchum) evades the police who suspect his involvement in a string of recent murders. Risking a private meeting in his hotel room with long-time acquaintance police detective Lt. Nulty (John Ireland), Marlowe relates the events of the past several weeks:After Marlowe wraps up a missing teenager investigation, hulking ex-convict Moose Malloy (Jack O'Halloran), who has just completed a seven year stretch for a bank heist, asks the detective to locate his girlfriend, Velma Valento. While the men are walking down the street, shots are fired from a passing car at Malloy but Marlowe manages to push the larger man to the ground. Unperturbed, Malloy explains that he has not heard from Velma in six years and takes Marlowe to a downtown night club, called Florian's, where she used to work.At the club, Malloy demands to see the owner, Montgomery, but when the man tries to shoot him, Malloy kills him. After giving Marlowe $50 in cash to secure his services, Malloy slips away as Marlowe reports Montgomery's death to Nulty, insisting that the ex-con was killed only in self-defense.Upon learning that Tommy Ray (Walter McGinn), a former musician who played at Florian's, still lives across the street at the Crescent Hotel, Marlowe visits him. Ray, who is white, lives with his black wife and their young son, whom Marlowe befriends. Although Ray says he does not remember Velma, he directs Marlowe to Florian's widow, Jessie (Sylvia Miles), a faded club singer.The next day, Marlow drives over to Jessie's house, he brings Jessie a bottle of cheap bourbon, she reminisces about her days as a popular singer, then wonders why Tommy Ray would say he did not know Velma when he performed with her at the club.Marlowe then returns to the musician, who admits that he knew Velma. Armed with a photo of Velma provided by Ray, Marlowe questions several contacts in the burlesque trade. One club owner recalls that Velma, using another name, appeared in a couple of motion pictures, before breaking down and being placed in the Camarillo Sanitarium. Marlowe visits the sanitarium and finds the girl catatonic.Wondering how Malloy will take the news, Marlowe returns to his office where he finds Lindsay Marriott (John O'Leary) waiting for him. Marriott explains that a friend had an extremely rare jade necklace stolen and the thief has demanded $15,000 for its return. Marriott has agreed to make the exchange for his friend later that night and gives Marlowe a hundred dollars to accompany and protect him.That evening, Malloy confronts Marlowe in a restaurant but dismisses the detective's report on Velma being in a sanitarium. After asserting that Marlowe's picture is not of Velma, Malloy insists that the detective continue his search. Marlowe then goes back to the Crescent Hotel to talk to Ray to find out why he has lied to him, but the musician is not home.Later that same night, Marlowe meets Marriott and drives his car to the rendezvous. Standing a few feet away from the car, Marlowe is knocked unconscious and when he awakens, he is surrounded by Nulty and police officers who have found Marriott shot dead in the car. Nulty takes Marlowe into police headquarters where he and his partner, Billy Rolfe (Harry Dean Stanton), question him. Grudgingly accepting Marlowe's explanation, Nulty releases him and the detective immediately sets out to learn who killed Marriott and tried to frame him for the killing.Directed by a ""fence"" to an underground jewelry store in Chinatown, Marlowe discovers that the only person who can afford the rare jade is elderly city judge Baxter Wilson Grayle (Jim Thompson). Marlowe drives to Grayle's elegant mansion, where the judge informs Marlowe that his wife is not missing any jewelry. The detective meets the judge's sultry young trophy wife, Helen (Charlotte Rampling), who is wearing an elegant jade necklace.

Disconcerted, Marlowe departs.After returning to his office that evening, Marlowe is attacked and knocked out by Cowboy (Burton Gilliam), Jonnie (Sylvester Stallone) and Nick (Joe Spinell), three henchmen of the infamous madam Frances Amthor (Kate Murtaugh). At Amthor's bordello, Marlowe is drugged and questioned about Malloy's whereabouts to which he refuses to answer. After being beaten, Marlowe is placed in a back room where, upon rousing, he finds the dead body of Tommy Ray. After Cowboy arrives to take Marlowe to Amthor, the detective knocks him out, escapes and finds Amthor in her office where he demands an explanation for his abduction. Before Amthor can respond, however, they are interrupted by one of the prostitutes reporting that Amthor's favorite girl is in bed with Jonnie. Outraged, Amthor rushes to a nearby room, but when she begins to beat the girl, Jonnie shoots Amthor dead. In the ensuing mayhem, Marlowe, although still reeling from the effects of the drugs, staggers away.After recovering for the next several days in the apartment of friend and newspaper vendor Georgie (Jimmie Archie), Marlowe visits Mrs. Ray to relay the news of Tommy's death.That night, Helen telephones Marlowe at his office to invite him to a re-election party for her husband at the swank White Orchid club, owned by gambler gangster Laird Brunette (Anthony Zerbe). Meeting Helen at the party later, Marlowe learns that Grayle helped Brunette with a tax situation regarding his yacht and the men have remained on friendly terms. Familiar with Brunette from his days working in the district attorney's office, Marlowe joins Brunette at his table where the gambler gives him $2,000 to help him contact Malloy.The next day, Jessie Florian telephones Marlowe to relay that Velma has been in touch with her and wishes to speak with Malloy. Knowing that Brunette has ordered him followed to find out if he meets Malloy, Marlowe lays low for a few days, then, when contacted by Malloy, arranges with Jessie to have Velma telephone him at Georgie's apartment. Velma asks Malloy to meet her at a rundown motel out of town, but when Malloy and Marlowe arrive there, they are ambushed by two men with machine guns. After Marlowe kills the gunmen, Malloy refuses to accept that he has been set-up by Velma and departs.Marlowe then reports the murders to Nulty, who is angered that Marlowe has continued to keep him from questioning Malloy regarding the Florian's club murder. Hoping to glean more information from Jessie, Marlowe takes Nulty and Rolfe to her house, only to discover that she has been murdered.In the present, Marlowe reaches the end of his account to Nulty, admitting that he remains unsure about who is holding Velma, but is certain Malloy would never have gone to the motel had he not actually spoken with her. When Marlowe tells Nulty that he believes Brunette is involved, Nulty refuses to accompany him to the gangster's yacht, the Lido. After Nulty leaves the hotel, Marlowe calls Malloy and the men meet at the pier and hire a speed boat to reach the floating casino. After making their way through the lively gambling parlor, Marlowe comes upon Cowboy and Nick and, at gunpoint, demands to see Brunette.In Brunette's state room, the gambler denies knowing Velma, but moments later Helen appears and Malloy greets her as Velma. Helen assures Malloy that he will receive his cut for taking the fall for the bank robbery years before and orders him to kill Marlowe. When Malloy hesitates, Marlowe points out that those who knew that Helen had once been a prostitute named Velma all ended up dead.... Marriott, Ray, Jessie and Amthor. Brunette and Helen acknowledge that Judge Grayle is unaware of his wife's past and Brunette was blackmailing her in order to maintain Grayle's protection. Dismayed to realize that he has been Helen's target all along, Malloy turns on her, but she shoots him and is, in turn, shot dead by Marlowe. At that moment, Nulty, who has reconsidered abandoning Marlowe, turns up with several officers. Sickened by the sordid entanglements of the case, Marlowe leaves the scene.In the final scene, Marlow, buoyed by one thought, takes the $2,000 from Brunette and goes to the Crescent Hotel to give the money to Tommy Ray's widow and son."
Bug,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072750/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An earthquake releases a strain of mutant cockroaches with the ability to start fires, which proceed to cause destructive chaos in a small town. The studies carried out by scientist James Parmiter, however, reveal an intent with much more far-reaching consequences.—Ross Horsley <ics6rh@leeds.ac.uk> Scientist James Parmiter (Bradford Dillman) delivers his wife, Carrie (Joanna Miles), to a church sermon at a country parish, then drives to work at a local university. During a sermon about God's ""gentle caress,"" a major earthquake strikes and nearly demolishes the chapel, but no one is killed. While the parishioners evacuate, Carrie grabs her Bible and calls James from a payphone, thereby missing her ride home with Henry Tacker and his son, Kenny. As the two men approach the Tacker farm, their pickup truck explodes in flames. Young Norma Tacker (Jamie Smith Jackson) watches in horror as her father and brother burn.That night, Norma is retrieved from her vigil inside the burned truck by her boyfriend, Gerald Metbaum (Richard Gilliland). Both are unaware that the vehicle is hosting killer cockroaches. Returning home, Norma retires while Gerald hears strange noises and surveys the property to discover large, incendiary cockroaches near a fault line created during the earthquake. A cat is killed when a cockroach com-busts on its head.Sometime later, Gerald visits the biology class of his former professor, James Parmiter, who lectures that modern man has lost his innate ability to communicate with other living creatures. When the students leave, the two men eat lunch at the cafeteria and Gerald reports his entomological discovery at the Tacker farm, the earthquake's epicenter. When James argues that fire-producing insects do not exist, Gerald shows him the dead cat.James goes to the farm with Gerald and is astonished that the cockroaches are able to make fire by rubbing their legs together. He also observes one cockroach feeding on ashes. Soon, the town is besieged by fires in most of its buildings and James calls the mayor to warn him about the bugs, but the mayor is unavailable.Back at the university laboratory, James's colleague, Mark Ross (Alan Fudge), examines a cockroach specimen and reports that the insects eat carbon and are indestructible to any blunt force. James wonders how the cockroaches travel from place to place, since they cannot fly.At the Parmiter home, Carrie prepares to leave for the Tacker funeral with Mark's wife, Sylvia, and James returns in time to say goodbye. Alone in the house, James is visited by a handyman named Charlie, who reports strange noises coming from James's car. James discovers cockroaches feasting on his engine and orders Charlie to leave. He then lures the insects into a trap with a freshly burned newspaper.Meanwhile at the Tacker funeral, Carrie gives Norma and her surviving brother, Tom, a handkerchief that Henry gave her at the church just before the earthquake struck. When Norma, Tom, and Gerald return home to pack up the house, Norma answers the telephone and a cockroach, nesting in the receiver, attacks her ear. Gerald extracts the bug with a burned newspaper and Norma is sent to the hospital.Meanwhile, James drives to the farm, which is now smoking from the fires triggered by the cockroaches. He impales one of the insects, causing it to explode. Excited by his discovery, James phones Mark and they meet at the laboratory. James explains that the bugs are slow-moving because of atmospheric pressure, and they are suffering from decompression sickness. Before the earthquake, the cockroaches lived entirely underground in a dense atmosphere, but now they are struggling to stay alive. James suspects the insects are ancient creatures trapped underneath the Earth's surface during a prehistoric volcanic eruption. When Mark adds that the cockroaches cannot reproduce and that they will soon self-destruct in the Earth's atmosphere, James is despondent.Sometime later, James asks Gerald to build a large pressure tank. Gerald hopes that James' experiments will help Norma recover from the cockroach attack and agrees. Back at the Parmiter home, Carrie discovers a surprise birthday cake that Sylvia hid in the garage. She brings it inside, unaware that a cockroach is clinging to the box. The insect attaches itself to Carrie's shirt, then sets her hair on fire, causing the woman to ignite.Later, Mark arrives at the laboratory to find James paralyzed with grief. Seeking to make sense of the tragedy, James returns to the Tacker farm and sees the burned shells of deceased cockroaches. He captures a sole surviving insect and places it in Gerald's newly crafted pressure tank, muttering, ""I will make you live."" He then introduces an average household cockroach into the tank and the two bugs copulate.Sometime later, Gerald and Norma return to the Tacker home, but he refuses them entry. James is angered to learn that the location of his hideout has been leaked to Mark. The couple leave food for James, then drive away. Days pass and the cockroach mating is successful. However, the female ""fire bug"" guards her egg case and James is unable to perform experiments.Several more days later, the egg case increases in size and James transfers it out of the pressure tank and into a box. There, the egg hatches numerous infants that grow to adult cockroaches within five hours. When James reintroduces the mother cockroach to her offspring, they kill her and James sobs. Soon, cockroaches escape from their box and feast on James's uncooked steak; he discovers that they only consume raw meat and eat collaboratively, as a ""single unit."" That night, James awakens to find cockroaches sucking blood from his chest and secures them in the pressure tank.Over the next several days, James suspects that the cockroaches listen to his voice and watch him, as well as form symbolic patterns with their bodies to communicate messages. Late one night, he discovers that the insects have escaped the tank to form the letters of his last name on the wall, along with the message: ""We live."" Terrified, James realizes the bugs have great powers and runs from the house to get them more food. Meanwhile, Sylvia takes a taxi to the Tacker home, intending to give James the Bible that Carrie held so dear. She screams upon finding the house infested with cockroaches and a cassette tape of James' voice, repeating: ""I've gone too far."" As the insects burn her face, Sylvia runs outside and dies in the barn. Feasting on their kill, the bugs procreate and climb into the fault line. When James returns, he discovers the insects missing.That evening, Mark arrives, looking for Sylvia, and notices that James has become mentally unhinged; unshaven and disheveled. Although James orders his colleague to leave, he promises to return to the university in a few days. With Mark gone, James is horrified when he discovers Sylvia's body. He grabs the Bible and tries to phone the authorities, but the line has been severed by the mutant cockroaches. Hearing the insects, James wanders outside to see a bright red light emanating from the fault as giant cockroaches, now equipped with wings, fly away. Although James tries to escape into the house, the creatures smash through the window in pursuit and set him and the whole house on fire. As James tumbles out of the front door in flames, he falls into the fault and the cockroaches follow. The fissure closes, trapping the cockroaches underneath the Earth's surface yet again."

Falconhurst, a run down plantation, is owned by Warren Maxwell, and largely run by his son, Hammond Maxwell, who walks with a limp due to a childhood accident. Hammond is under pressure to get married and produce a male heir to continue the Maxwell legacy before Warren dies. With no experience courting a potential bride - his sexual experiences confined to slaves and whores - Hammond ultimately chooses his cousin Blanche for his wife in what would not be considered a courtship in its true sense. In turn, Blanche agrees to the marriage largely to escape the realm of her sadistic brother, Charles. As his father tells him is custom, Hammond, while on his and Blanche's honeymoon in New Orleans, also obtains a slave as a go to sexual partner, he buying Ellen, who he met when she was given to him in hospitality when visiting who was then her master. Concurrently, Hammond also purchases Mede, a Mandingo, as a slave, something Warren had always wanted because of their physical strength. The plan with Mede is to breed him with their female slaves to produce further Mandingos who they can sell for a higher price than other black slaves. However, Hammond, out of circumstance, uses Mede in the potentially lucrative sport of no holds barred slave fighting, often to the death.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table embark on a surreal, low-budget search for the Holy Grail, encountering many, very silly obstacles. History is turned on its comic head when, in tenth-century England, King Arthur travels the countryside to find knights who will join him at the Round Table in Camelot. Gathering up the men is a tale in itself but after a bit of a party at Camelot, many decide to leave only to be stopped by God, who sends them on a quest: to find the Holy Grail. After a series of individual adventures, the knights are reunited but must face a wizard named Tim the Enchanter, killer rabbits and lessons in the use of holy hand grenades. Their quest comes to an end however when the Police intervene - just what you would expect in a Monty Python movie.—garykmcd In search of brave and faithful supporters to join the Knights of the Round Table, the legendary British leader, King Arthur of Camelot, rides around Britain's countryside atop his noble steed. Before long, a handful of good men answer his call; however, after careful consideration, they decide to go their separate ways, only to provoke the wrath of the omnipotent being in the clouds, who commands Arthur and his followers to find the fabled Holy Grail. Now, on a mission from God himself, five men must brave taunting French soldiers; confront sexually obsessed virgins; do battle with the notorious Black Knight; face a mysterious enchanter named ""Tim"", and slay a vicious furry protector. But, are King Arthur's knights up to the task?—Nick Riganas Arthur, King of the Britons, is looking for knights to sit with him at Camelot. He finds many knights including Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Launcelot the Brave, the quiet Sir Bedevere, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Launcelot. Through satire of certain events in history, they find Camelot, but after literally a quick song and dance they decide that they do not want to go there. While walking away, God comes to them from a cloud and tells them to find the Holy Grail. They agree and begin their search. Throughout their search, they meet interesting people and knights along the way.—Zucco The credits are rolled to deeply ominous music with several false starts, interlaced with apologies for the inadequacies of each, during which numerous titlers are fired en masse. In the end, credits that are heavily laced with references to moose, llamas and other furry animals roll to highly festive Latin music.Little is to be seen but fog over a grassland while the sound of a galloping horse&mdash;a sound that could only be made on cobblestone, but not grass&mdash;is heard. From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconut shells. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics. Frustrated, Arthur and Patsy emulate riding off.The scene changes to a plague village. A cart is being drawn through the streets, and is attended by a disheveled man (Eric Idle) who strikes a triangle and calls for the residents to ""bring out your dead."" A peasant (John Cleese) tries to lay a decrepit man on the cart, without calling attention to the fact that he is still alive. The attendant refuses to accept living cargo (citing regulations). When the peasant tries to abstractly request a favour, the attendant looks up and down the street to make sure there are no witnesses, and strikes the elderly subject a deadly blow to the head, solving the problem. The cart and the peasant continue on their ways. Arthur and Patsy emulate a ride through the village, and the attendant correctly infers that Arthur is a king from the fact that he is not covered in shit.On a hillside, near a castle, Arthur approaches a peasant (Michael Palin) from behind and calls out ""Old woman!"" The peasant, Dennis, barely turns his head to correct the king with ""man!"" Rather than killing this vulgar subject on the spot for such gross insubordination, Arthur tries to apologize for the mistake. Unimpressed, Dennis then launches into a rant, making it very clear that he has harboured a great deal of bitterness over the class system, which he has experienced from the bottom all his life (of 37 years). Arthur is challenged to justify his kingship, and to an accompaniment of heavenly voices, tells the tale of the Lady of the Lake presenting Arthur with Excalibur. Dennis confidently challenges this presumption of political legitimacy. Focusing on the executive branch, he asserts that it must ""derive from a mandate from the masses."" Arthur can only respond by barking orders that the peasant be silent. Unaffected, Dennis continues his elocution of democratic dogma, at which point Arthur manhandles him. This only encourages Dennis; he becomes a raving firebrand, and tries to call as much attention as possible to Arthur's assault. The king accepts that he cannot adequately assert this authority in this situation, and relinquishes Dennis with ""Bloody peasant!"" Dennis, despite his anger, appears delighted at this parting shot, and its significance to his message. He seeks validation from the gathering crowd.While travelling through a forest, Arthur and Patsy encounter an epic battle between two armoured, faceless men. The weapons: swords, an anointed mace, and an axe. When the black-clad knight (John Cleese) runs his opponent through the face, he retrieves his sword and then simply stands tall. Arthur approaches him and praises him for his performance. The knight neither speaks a word, nor even turns his gaze towards the king. Despite this insolence, Arthur again does not respond with homicide, but invites the knight to enter his court. When no response is given, Arthur announces that he will continue on his quest. The knight then speaks with a deep voice and economy of words, repeating ""None shall pass,"" forbidding Arthur to cross the bridge before which he is standing. This bridge would allow the party to cross a gully no more than 10 feet wide. Arthur and the knight draw their swords, and a much less epic battle ensues. When Arthur severs one of the knight's arms, he is unwilling to accept defeat. Arthur relieves the knight of his other arm and kneels down to offer a prayer of thanks. The knight kicks him over. The now completely unarmed knight drops his ominous mystique, and childishly goads Arthur into chopping off his remaining limbs. As the knight can no longer obstruct Arthur, he and Patsy ride off, ignoring the knight's continued challenges.A group of monks are chanting in Latin while hitting themselves with wooden boards as they traverse a village which looks much like the plague village. A frenzied mob drags a lady accused of being a witch (Connie Booth) to Bedevere (Terry Jones), who is performing an experiment involving a coconut tied to a bird. They present their case based on the way she is dressed, the funnel on her head, and the parsnip tied over her nose. They also present testimony from a peasant (John Cleese) who had been turned into a newt (or so he claims). Bedevere proceeds to deduce the validity of their charge in his own way, after making the villagers admit that they put a fake nose on the witch. Using a scientific method befitting the Dark Ages of Europe, he develops a formula for identifying a witch based on the flammability and buoyancy of various objects and materials. The crowd becomes very quiet and still, probably because Bedevere is overtaxing their intelligence. It is eventually reasoned that the weight of the accused compared to that of a duck determines whether she is a witch. Remembering their original purpose, they return to their frenzy and carry her off to be weighed. As she is heavier than a duck, she is taken to be burnt as a witch. Right afterwards, Arthur approaches Bedevere. When Arthur identifies himself, Bedevere bows to the king, and is then knighted&mdash;Camelot has its first knight.We are hurried through the recruitment of the remaining knights by the Book of the Film. They are Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin) (also called ""the Chaste""), Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot (Eric Idle), and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film (a baby (William Palin) suited up in chain mail).The party emulates riding to Camelot and when they spy it from a distance, they stop to appreciate its majesty. We are treated to a song and dance routine performed by the knights, presumably within the castle walls. This includes an interlude with tap-dancing, and a percussion solo. Even the decrepit shell of a man (Mark Zycon) suspended by his wrists in the dungeon below manages to pathetically cheer the upbeat celebrations upstairs. We are then returned to the outside of Camelot, at the same distance from the castle. Arthur seems to have had the same perception we have just had, since he elects to avoid Camelot, calling it a ""silly place.""As Arthur and company ride to some unknown destination, a low-budget animation of the Almighty appears in the sky. He is not willing to suffer fools gladly, and when done chastising Arthur for his obsequiousness, charges Arthur with seeking the Holy Grail. Thus, the Quest for the Holy Grail begins, as manifested by another animation sequence with images reminiscent of medieval art.Our heroes encounter a castle with a French taunter (John Cleese) who taunts them with random names like ""Daffy English knights"" (unaware that ""knight"" has silent letters, and only one ""n"") and makes up flowery insults such as ""I fart in your general direction!"" and ""Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!"" Whether this man is French is unclear, since his French-talking colleagues appear to understand English words more readily than French ones, and his accent slips when shouting ""I'm French!"" Arthur gives the same terms to the inhabitants of the castle as he did with the first one he approached, including, of course, the part involving the Grail. The Frenchman claims that they already have a grail, but then indicates to his peers that this is a mischievous fabrication. Half-stunned, Arthur asks to see it. The guard rejects the request with his typical inane derision. Arthur then takes a more aggressive posture, and in mid-threat, the French launch a cow from what sounds like a catapult at Arthur's party, landing on one of them. With all possible gusto, Arthur orders a charge, and they all attack the castle walls (several feet high) with nothing more effective than swords. Arthur's party is treated to a barrage of livestock. Arthur orders a retreat, but since he does not know the meaning of the word, he uses a different expression. The taunter hears battle noises, but there is nothing to see. Sir Bedevere's keen mind hatches a plan: a giant hare made of wood known as a Trojan Rabbit is wheeled towards the castle. The French understand that it is intended as a present for them, and then cautiously bring it into the castle. Sir Bedevere explains the remainder of his plans... but at this point he realizes that he forgot the step where the knights are supposed to climb into the rabbit, before it is to be presented to the enemy. Using the same technology as before, the wooden colossus is sent over the castle walls, killing one of the servants (Neil Innes).A clapperboard is snapped in front of ""a famous historian"" (John Young) wearing a modern suit and tie, who narrates some unseen details of Arthur's experience with the French, and then informs us that the king decided that he and his knights should search for the Grail individually. Anything else he was going to tell us is cut short when an unidentified knight on horseback slashes his neck. The historian's wife shows up crying for help.After they split up, Sir Robin travels through a forest with his favourite minstrels. The vocal one sings of Robin's bravery, and describes in graphic detail the various ordeals that Robin is prepared to face. Just as the minstrel is about to sing of the gory treatment Robin's penis could withstand, Robin gracefully orders them silent. They immediately encounter a three-headed giant (Terry Jones,Graham Chapman, andMichael Palin). The giant interrogates Robin, who wishes to discreetly downplay his significance, but his minstrel sings of Robin's identity and credentials. One of the heads wishes to cut Robin's head off, but the heads immediately descend into bickering about each others' lifestyles and various things completely unrelated to Robin. When they finally agree on their next course of action, they see that Robin is no longer available. Sir Robin has continued on the quest, and his minstrel sings a song that absurdly describes his lord's brave cowardice, over Robin's objections.Galahad, wet, weary, and probably depleted of much of his short-term vitality, follows a Grail-shaped light to Castle Anthrax. There he finds a colony of robe-clad teens, who will not hear of any talk about a Grail, but insist on tending to what they perceive to be Galahad's immediate needs&mdash;they decide that they are medical. Galahad is shy, and finds the strength to resist temptation, and again demands to see the Grail. At this point a girl named Dingo (Carol Cleveland) realizes that one of their rules has been broken, for which Galahad must administer the punishment. Dingo describes the punishment, which expands to include more and more inhabitants of the castle, and becomes increasingly sexual. Galahad finally seems willing to accept their hospitality, but then his friends storm the castle and rescue him. As he is being rescued he insists on remaining to fight the perils alone, but they valiantly stand by him, thinking only of his safety. The heroes leave a castle full of very frustrated girls (Elspeth Cameron,Mitsuko Forstater, andSandy Rose).In the famous ""Scene 24,"" Arthur and Sir Bedevere are in a hut trying to extract information about the Grail from a frighteningly withered old man (Terry Gilliam), who can only cackle insanely to Arthur's questions. A fire burns in the middle of the room. Eventually the miscreation speaks, but does not answer Arthur's questions directly. He does speak of an enchanter and the Bridge of Death. The old man disappears, as does the hut&mdash;along with any indication of civilization, save the fire.Arthur's party progresses through a foggy forest to the accompaniment of stressful music, while Arthur makes anxious glances to the left and the right. The stress is brought to its natural end when they find themselves before a knight (Michael Palin) who's approximately twice the height of Arthur. He is surrounded by several other armoured men who lumber about like animals. They are the Knights who say ""Ni!"" They do indeed say ""Ni!"" as a form of intimidation and coercion, and liberally use it on Arthur at the slightest provocation, and also dread using the word ""it."" They demand a shrubbery from Arthur on pain of death.Meanwhile, a group of modern-day police officers conduct an investigation of the murder of the famous historian, and interview a woman (Rita Davies) who was close to him.The King of Swamp Castle (Michael Palin) brags (in a Yorkshire accent) about how he managed to build a castle on the worst possible terrain he could find, and brashly admits that the first few attempts were complete failures. He then explains to his son, Prince Herbert (Terry Jones), that the acquisition of more land is essential to their kingdom, which is why he must marry a princess who is connected to a great deal of it. Herbert has a horribly pale complexion, and is so effeminate that his own father mistakes him for someone called Alice.Herbert is reluctant to participate in this land-grab, and wishes to express himself in song, but the king shouts down the erupting music and forbids Herbert to sing. The king impatiently closes the discussion and storms off. As he prepares to leave the room, he orders two guards to watch Herbert. Unfortunately, the guard with speaking parts (Eric Idle) has a very hard time processing the phrase ""stay here and make sure he doesn't leave."" When the king finally leaves, melancholy music erupts, and the king returns to repeat his prohibition on singing. Herbert then tries to inconspicuously write a note, tie it to an arrow and shoot it through a window to the outside. The guards see what he is doing, but appear oblivious to the ramifications. Sir Lancelot discovers the note when the arrow it is tied to buries itself in the chest of his servant, Concorde (Eric Idle). The message is from someone pleading to be rescued from a forced marriage. Lancelot enthusiastically assumes that this is part of his quest for the Grail, and resolves to rescue what he thinks is a maiden.He charges into the castle and attacks several members of a wedding party, including the father of the bride and as many unarmed guards as he can. When he takes too many seconds between killing people, he attacks a wall-hanging. He bursts into Herbert's room, and then kills the guards while one of them tries to recall the instructions his king gave him, and how they might relate to the newcomer. The king appears and expresses his displeasure at the disruption that Lancelot has caused. However, when he learns that Lancelot is from Camelot, he appears to believe that Lancelot can provide some unspecified gain in lieu of Herbert.After severing the linens that Herbert is currently using to make his escape down the castle walls, the king escorts Lancelot out of the room, while making friendly conversation. The king tries to introduce Lancelot to the crowd, but their predictable hostility excites Lancelot into combat once again, and he kills a few more people before the king can calm him down. The king explains the new arrangement involving the princess and her holdings, which somehow depends on the death of her father. When her father appears to be recovering from Lancelot's attack, he motions to one of his guards, who approaches the father of the bride. The king delivers a narrative of the princess's father succumbing to his wounds, and surely enough, he dies. Herbert then appears in the castle, apparently in good health, which irritates his father. His irritation escalates when Herbert begins to explain his ordeal in song. Concorde appears and suggests that Lancelot return to the quest. Lancelot insists on a melodramatic exit, and then swings across the room from a rope. Somehow the stunt fails, and he is left dangling above the centre of the room.While riding into yet another provincial village, Arthur meets the Old Crone (Bee Duffell). She is asked about a shrubbery, but appears terrified by the inquiry, and refuses to cooperate. With some reluctance about the optics of such a spectacle, Arthur and Bedevere coerce her with the word ""Ni!"" Fortunately, Roger the Shrubber (Eric Idle) boldly happens by, and both parties are satisfied.Arthur and Bedevere return to the dreaded Knights who say ""Ni!"" but find that their name has been changed (to something so complex and random it was probably ad libbed, and therefore cannot be repeated here). The Knights who (so recently) said ""Ni!"" charge Arthur with another useless errand and an impossible task. The eccentric Knights are defeated by Arthur's accidental discovery of a secret word which is their weakness. Robin and his musically sardonic minstrels then appear on the scene. They ride off together.In the modern world, the police continue their investigation of the historian's murder.Back in the Medieval world, the adventurers each overcome their perils and reunite to face a bleak and terrible winter (which they survive by eating Sir Robin's minstrels).The reunited party ventures further to find the enchanter named Tim (John Cleese). Tim the Enchanter appears as a Scots-talking middle-aged man but commands great powers of pyrokinesis, has a very long, grey-streaked beard, and on his head either wears ram's horns, or grows them there. He is also able to withstand long awkward silences, doing nothing to break them. Arthur and his party are in awe of Tim and his spectacular display of pyrotechnics, and find themselves flustered when asking him for help, as per the instructions of the Old Man from Scene 24. Tim promises to help with their next phase of intelligence gathering and beckons the party follow him. After one step, he abruptly turns around and speaks of a terrible monster. The longer he spends on the warning, the more foolish he appears. Arthur's fearful respect for the enchanter is diminishing.The company approaches a rock-encircled clearing beyond which is the mouth of a cave that breathes smoke. Skeletons litter the scene. The tension jumps when Tim sights the monster. When the knights realize that the monster is an average-looking rabbit, the tension immediately turns to annoyance and scorn. Sir Bors (Terry Gilliam), ordered to dispatch the creature, sets forth to perform the task as casually as a short-order cook would perform his craft. The rabbit leaps about six feet to bite off Sir Bors's head before the knight even raises his sword. Tim feels vindicated and expresses it as would an 11-year-old. Arthur, believing a full scale attack is sufficient to accomplish the task, orders one. When several knights die in the attempt, he orders a retreat (in his own unique way).Tim regards the carnage with scorn of his own&mdash;wild chortling. When someone recalls the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, Arthur calls to Brother Maynard (Eric Idle), who is seen with his entourage a stone's-throw away, but off-camera until this scene. They consult with his order's exhaustive canon on use of the weapon, the Book of Arnaments, verses 9-21, describing how to use the grenade (""And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin. And the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths, and carp and anchovies, and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit-bats and large chu&mdash;[Cleric is told to skip forward by Brother Maynard]&mdash;And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.') After a miscount, the grenade is thrown at the rabbit, and a thundering explosion alerts the police, who are already looking for a murderer.In the cave beyond the rabbit, Aramaic writing is found, which Brother Maynard translates. Finally, they receive concrete instructions on where to find the Grail: the ""Castle of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh"". While they are trying to deduce the meaning of the text, the knights are ambushed by the Legendary (Animated) Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh. The human party (also animated) are chased about the cave, and are only saved when the animator (Terry Gilliam) suffers a fatal heart attack.In the modern world, the police discover the gruesome scene at the cave entrance. They assume it's a homicide, and not an animal attack.Arthur's party approaches the Bridge of Death that is guarded by the Old Man from Scene 24. Arthur orders Sir Robin to face the deadly quiz that the Old Man will give him, but Robin deflects the order. Lancelot makes the first attempt, and when the party sees that the challenge is as difficult as answering a few superficial personal questions, Robin finds his bravery renewed, and volunteers to be the next participant. Unfortunately, the last question asked Robin involves geographical trivia that would have been very rare knowledge in the Dark Ages, and Robin is thrown into the Pit of Death. Then Galahad flubs his answer and is also lost. When Arthur is asked a question about aerodynamics (involving the redundant ""airspeed velocity""), he solves the problem by answering it with a specific question (which the Bridgekeeper cannot answer). The Old Man is cast into the pit, and the way is clear.Arthur and Bedevere search for Lancelot, but he is not to be found. In fact, he has his hands pressed against a police car and is being searched. The king and his remaining free knight are called by an ethereal song. They are drawn over misty mountains to a lake. To a majestic, brass-rich soundtrack, a barge with the head of a monster transports our heroes across the water to the island of the Castle Aaarrghh.As the music reaches crescendo, the men disembark and kneel. Arthur, mounting his sword tip on the ground, offers the Lord a solemn prayer. The music is interrupted by the sound of a catapult being discharged. Arthur's speech switches from prayer to blasphemy as a sheep lands on them. The Taunting Frenchman appears atop the castle wall and offers his usual insolence. Arthur launches into orders, threats, and expressions of indignation invoking God's name. The French respond with human waste. Humiliated and soiled, Arthur and Bedevere walk back through the water to the mainland as the French taunt at will.Reaching the other side of the lake, Arthur shouts to an unseen party to stand ready. To the sound of a military drum, emerging on a nearby ridge, soldiers numbering maybe 1,000 form a line of battle nearly as many feet in width. They are well equipped. Arthur shouts a deadly oath across the lake to the French who persist in their taunts. Without hesitation, Arthur orders a charge, and the company surges forward.As the soldiers approach the shore on the mainland, they are cut off by just two modern-day police cars. The line of battle has shrunk to less than 100 feet, and Arthur and Bedevere are arrested. At least three of the officers start pushing back the crowd and confiscate an ""offensive weapon."" The film breaks in the projector and runs out of the gate, putting an abrupt end to the movie. For the duration of the film, there are several minutes of organ music but no end credits."

The Wind and the Lion,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073906/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Berber chieftain triggers an international incident, drawing the involvement of Theodore Roosevelt, when he kidnaps an American widow and her children in 1900s Morocco. At the beginning of the 20th century an American woman is abducted in Morocco by Berbers. The attempts to free her range from diplomatic pressure to military intervention.—Anonymous Sean Connery brings his commanding presence and rugged heroism to the lead role of desert chieftain Raisuli in this rousing historical epic filled with eye-dazzling vistas and sweeping battle scenes.In 1904 Morocco, European powers desire a foothold in the Arab world - and Raisuli is determined to stir up tribal fury against them. So he kidnaps an American widow (Candice Bergen) and her children, igniting a chain of events that include President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) wielding the big stick of foreign policy and Raisuli matching wits and sharing mutual admiration with his lovely captive. John Milius scripts and directs, bending true-life fact to serve his storytelling craft, shaping history into spirited screen legend. A fictionalized account centered on a real life incident is presented. It's 1904, and wealthy Americans Eden Pedecaris and her two adolescent children, William and Jennifer, living in Tangiers, Morocco, are kidnapped when their mansion is stormed in a violent invasion. The perpetrator of the incident is Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli, a Berber sheikh. Raisuli, whose intentions are initially unclear, claims that he is working on behalf of Allah, and that he is not a barbarian in being educated. Beyond Raisuli's assertions, Mrs. Pedecaris is outwardly not afraid in believing that Raisuli, based on his actions and attitudes beyond his stated threats and some violent incidents to prove that he means what he says, indeed intends her and her children no harm. While the relationship between the Pedecarises and Raisuli shifts during the Pedicarises captivity, the nature of the situation changes in its entirety when Raisuli divulges his true intention with them, which has to do with Morocco's tenuous geopolitical situation especially in relation to multiple European colonializing forces wanting their hold on Morocco, and as US PresidentTheodore Roosevelt, seeking reelection, thinks that he can kill two birds with one stone in orchestrating the safe return of American citizens while hanging his reelection bid on the issue of the country's security.—Huggo"

After the Sheriff leaves, Dan heads back to the impact zone to dig for more rocks. He is attacked and eaten by a gigantic spider, the size of a car. His curiosity whetted, Billy stops by the Kester place to talk to Dan a little more about the diamond, but Dan is missing.

The mob ignores the order and heads for the Kester place.The giant spider attacks the Gleason Days carnival. The Sheriff is called by Gleason officials and told the spider is headed his way. He calls for the National Guard. Vance and Langer had discussed earlier the possibility of using a neutron device to destroy a mini-black hole that allowed the spiders to invade our planet. The neutron device is shipped to the local airport and loaded on a helicopter. The target is the impact site. Meanwhile, the mob gathers and Sheriff Jones tries to keep them off the Kester property.

Picnic at Hanging Rock,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073540/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During a rural summer picnic, a few students and a teacher from an Australian girls' school vanish without a trace. Their absence frustrates and haunts the people left behind. Three students and a school teacher disappear on an excursion to Hanging Rock, in Victoria, on Valentine's Day, 1900. The movie follows those that disappeared, and those that stayed behind, but it delights in the asking of questions, not the answering of them. Even though both the movie and the book it was based on claim to be inspired by real events, the story is completely fictional.—David Carroll <davidc@atom.ansto.gov.au> On Valentine's Day 1900, most of the small student body and staff of Appleyard College, a private girls' boarding school in Victoria State, Australia, are going on a day long picnic to nearby Hanging Rock. Two people who will not be going are Mrs. Appleyard, the school's owner and proprietress, and Sara, a student who is being punished for a situation outside of her control. Later that evening, the picnickers arrive back to the college later than expected minus four people: teacher Miss McCraw, and students Miranda, Irma and Marion, all of whom have gone missing. The three girls plus a tag-along student, Emily, went exploring up the rock, when Emily came rushing off the rock by herself in a frightened panic, with several cuts and bruises and her dress torn. By that time, no one had noticed that Miss McCraw had also gone missing. Emily cannot remember anything about the incident beyond seeing Miss McCraw off in the distance climbing up the rock when she herself was heading down. As the authorities go on an exhaustive search for the missing four, their disappearance elicits different reactions from people involved. Michael Fitzhubert, a young well off man, who, along with his valet Albert, saw the four girls climbing up the rock, and feels compelled to find them. Sara, who idolized Miranda, is quietly affected as she keeps several secrets about herself and what Miranda told her earlier that day. And Miss Appleyard, although concerned about the welfare of the missing four, seems more concerned about the possibly tarnished reputation of the school, to which her name is attached, and the effect the scandal may have on its viability.—Huggo Against the backdrop of a hot St. Valentine's Day in early-1900s Victoria, the stern Mrs Appleyard's girls from the strict Appleyard College prepare for a field trip to Hanging Rock--the majestic volcanic formation near Mount Macedon. Under the scorching sun, three students--Miranda, Marion, and Irma--receive permission to explore the rock only to go missing later that day, and what is even more disturbing, when a fourth girl, Edith, returns screaming, the school teacher, Miss McCraw, disappears without a trace. The four women seem to have vanished into thin air. What has truly happened in Hanging Rock's deep and sharp crevices?—Nick Riganas Based on the acclaimed 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK is a stirring chronicle of the disappearance of an intimate group of women from an all-female college during a St. Valentine's Day outing and the event's lingering aftermath. Unfolding in the Colony of Victoria on the cusp of the dawning Commonwealth, the natural landscape seems to sensually envelop the carefree young women before yielding to the greater supernatural powers of Hanging Rock and the ghosts of its Aboriginal past.—Mae Moreno The film begins in a (fictional) English girls' school in the Australian bush on February 14, 1900. The school is headed by Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts), an indomitable and unbending figure of authority. Her staff include the remote mathematics mistress Miss Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray), said to have a 'masculine' intellect; the young and beautiful Mademoiselle de Portiers (Helen Morse) who teaches French and deportment, and the jittery Miss Lumley (Kirsty Child), who is anxious to please Mrs. Appleyard.Amid lingering images of white-clad girls in whispering voices delighting in Valentine's cards, the character of Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert) and her friend and admirer, Sara (Margaret Nelson) are introduced. Miranda's circle of friends includes Irma (Karen Robson), Marion (Jane Vallis), Rosamund (Ingrid Mason). Sara's affection for Miranda clearly stems from a deep romantic crush. Another pupil, Edith (Christine Schuler) hovers on the edge of Miranda's circle, desperate for acceptance. Sara, an orphan who is a kind of charity pupil, is disliked by Mrs. Appleyard, and is not allowed to join the outing, ostensibly because she has not memorized an assigned poem. Miranda shows worry that Sara dotes on her too much in which she tells Sara that she ""won't be here much longer"" (suggesting a premonition of her disappearance). The party leaves leaving behind Mrs. Appleyard and Sara.The girls ride to Hanging Rock, a 500-foot tall volcanic rock formation about 11 km northeast of the school. Mlle. de Portiers and Miss McCraw are the supervisors. Mr. Hussey drives the girls in his wagon on the trip to the formation. For some odd reason, everyone's timepiece and wristwatch stops at 12 noon when they arrive. Miranda cuts a cake in honor of St. Valentine and the party relaxes in the warm shade.Marion asks permission to take Miranda and Irma for an excursion on the rock and is accompanied by Edith. Their departure is witnessed by a fascinated young Englishman who attempts to follow them, but soon breaks away. After a brief nap (or swoon) on a plateau, they get up, and seemingly under a spell, three of them advance as one toward an inner recess, witnessed by Edith, who cries out to them not to go. She screams and runs downward. One of the teachers, Miss McCraw, leaves the picnic unnoticed and begins to climb the rock.Although the party was due back at about eight o'clock, it is 10:30 p.m. and after dark when Mr. Hussey's wagon arrives back at the school, where they tell Mrs. Appleyard about the mysterious disappearance. Edith remains hysterical and unable to explain what has transpired only that she saw Miss McCraw heading up toward the plateau without her skirt. The police investigation led by Sgt. Bumpher (Wyn Roberts) and Constable Jones (Garry McDonald) leads them to a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard) who was lunching at the rock with his family, his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert (Peter Collingwood) and Mrs. Fitzhubert (Olga Dickie). Michael, with Albert (John Jarratt), the Fitzhubert party's young local Australian valet, spent part of the lunch watching the picnic, but offer no clues in the investigation. Sara is devastated, but habitually treated coldly as the orphan she is by the teachers and students alike.The nearby town of Woodend quickly becomes restless as news of the disappearance spreads. The townsfolk are angry, demanding answers. Michael, who becomes obsessed with finding Miranda, gets Albert to accompany him to the Rock for another search after another search turned up nothing. The next morning, Albert travels up to the rock and finds a nearly delirious Michael whom he helps back down to the ground. Albert follows Michael's trail and discovers Irma, unconscious but unharmed.At the Fitzhubert home where Irma is treated for dehydration and exposure, she tells the police investigator that she has no memory of what happened on the rock, or of the fate of her companions. The servants note to themselves that her corset has gone missing.During a walk in the woods with Irma, Michael tells her that he's still obsessed with finding Miranda, but she still cannot remember anything about that day. Soon, both Albert and Michael begin to have terrible nightmares about a great evil that lurks at Hanging Rock. They continue to remain miserable over the three remaining disappearances.A kind of quiet mass hysteria consumes the school. Lessons seem to proceed with the usual tight order and control, but as the days pass and the missing women are not found, parents notify Mrs. Appleyard that they will be withdrawing their daughters from the school. During gym class, Irma stops by, dressed from head to foot in elegant red; her parents are taking her to Europe. The girls at first greet her with silence, then begin screaming frantically that she must tell them what happened, and physically attack her. Mlle. de Poitiers has to pull them off, and Irma runs away. Sara is discovered tied to the wall ""to correct her posture"". Miss Lumley gives notice that she is quitting.Mrs. Appleyard takes to drink and is more abusive than ever toward Sara, first telling her that her guardian has not paid her tuition and she must be sent to an institution, then lying to the remaining staff that Sara's guardian has taken her away overnight.The next morning, Sara's body is found in the greenhouse by Mr. Whitehead, the school's gardener. She apparently jumped or was pushed from her second floor bedroom window. When the gardener rushes into Mrs. Appleyard's office, she greets him with a calm stare; she is already dressed in full mourning with her things packed. Elsewhere, Albert tells Michael that he had a dream that his orphan sister came to see him in his dreams. Sara is revealed to be Albert's sister.Epilogue.

The story interweaves reflections about Russian history and society—<xaviermartin@hotmail.com> This film does not have a storyline, but proceeds in a non-narrative, stream-of-consciousness form. To add to the confusion, several of the characters are played by the same actors. Margarita Terekhova plays the roles of Maria (the mother, also called ""Masha"" or ""Marousia"" in some of the pre-war scenes), and of Natalya (the wife of the protagonist as a young woman). Ignat Daniltsev is the protagonist at age 12 (Alyosha/Aleksei), as well as Aleksei's own son at age12 (Ignat).A précis to the film will certainly help the viewer through this labyrinth.The film takes place in three distinct time periods: Pre-war (1930s), War-time, and Post-war (1960s), and can be divided into fourteen sections, each of which takes place during one or more of these periods. In the following breakdown of sections, I will indicate the time period for the section and a brief description of the section's content.1) Post-war. The film opens with Ignat turning on the television set. The program shown is that of a therapist treating an adolescent afflicted with stuttering. The credits follow. The Music: J. S. Bach, Das Orgelbüchlein No. 16, ""Das alte Jahr vergangen ist"" (The old year now hath pass'd away).2) Pre-war. Edge of a field, Maria and a doctor who is passing by (Anatoly Solonitsyn) meet and converse. Voice-over of the narrator (Innokenti Smoktunovsky), who is obviously the protagonist Aleksei (he talks in the first person, plural, ""we""). Arseni Tarkovsky's poem, read by the poet.

Lisa (Alla Demidova), Maria's friend, tells her she reminds her of Maria Timofeyevna (Captain Lebyadkin's sister in Dostoevsky's The Devils), which leads to recriminations on Lisa's part.6) War-time. Natalya and husband quarrel. Ignat watches the Spanish tenants. Archive footage of the Spanish Civil War. Children being evacuated. A stratospheric balloon journey undertaken by a Kurdish aviator in 1937. Music: Pergolesi, Stabat Mater, No 12: ""Quando corpus morietur fac ut animae donetur paradisi glori."" (While my body here decays, may my soul Thy goodness praise, safe in Paradise with Thee). Ticker tape parade.7) Post-war. Ignat leafs through Leonardo da Vinci book. Natalya drops her purse. Ignat reads Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev (October 19, 1836) to two unknown women, one of whom appears to be modeled after the poet Anna Akhmatova (1898-1966). Ignat answers the door. Ignat and his father talk on the phone.8)War-time. Aleksei looks at the redhead girl (Olga Kizilova). Music: Purcell, from The Indian Queen, Act IV, ""They tell us that your mighty powers.""

However, something happens that changes her safe routine. Jeanne Dielman, a lonely young widow, lives with her son Sylvain following an immutable order: while the boy is in school, she cares for their apartment, does chores, and receives clients in the afternoon.—Volker Boehm A lonely, ritual-obsessed widowed housewife does her daily chores, takes care of her apartment where she lives with her teenage son, and turns the occasional trick to make ends meet. When one of her clients causes her to have her first-ever orgasm, her life slowly falls apart.—MuzikJunky Widowed now for six years, Jeanne Dielman lives in a one-bedroom inner city Brussels flat with her teen-aged son Sylvain Dielman. She never really loved her husband and has no intention of ever remarrying, seeing it more of a chore of getting used to someone than ever missing emotional love. Most of the time, she tends to her household duties with a certain meticulousness and fastidiousness, but also with a definite routine. This attitude extends to the way she treats Sylvain, which is more as caregiver than loving mother. Included within her daily routine is looking after her neighbor's infant son while the mother runs her errands for the day and turning tricks with a small stable of regular clients in the apartment while Sylvain is at school. A few small changes to her routine over a thirty-six hour period culminates with something she's never experienced with one of her clients, which threatens what she knows her life to be. She has to decide how that incident will affect her psyche.—Huggo Jeanne Dielman is a middle-aged woman who takes care of her teenage son. Over a three day period the film follows her daily routine, one that never seems to change. She makes her son breakfast, prepares his clothes and cleans his shoes.

Her son isn't very communicative and Jeanne effectively lives alone and in the end leads to a surprising conclusion.—garykmcd ""Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles"" is a 1975 film directed by Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman. The film is a study of a woman's daily routine and her eventual psychological breakdown.Jeanne Dielman (Delphine Seyrig) is a widowed mother who lives with her son Sylvain (Jan Decorte) in a small apartment in Brussels. She is a meticulous and precise homemaker who spends her days cooking, cleaning, and performing domestic chores. Every day, she prepares and serves the same meals at the same time and carries out her routine with clockwork precision.However, as the film progresses, the audience becomes aware that Jeanne's meticulously ordered life is not as stable as it seems. Her son's absence during the day, coupled with the arrival of a male client (Henri Storck) at her apartment, leads to a gradual psychological unraveling, and the tension mounts as the routine becomes more and more disrupted.On the third day, Jeanne's routine is disrupted as she forgets to turn off the faucet in the kitchen, causing the sink to overflow. This small mistake appears to be the tipping point that sets off a series of psychological events that ultimately lead to Jeanne's breakdown.The climax of the film occurs when Jeanne, unable to cope with the pressure, kills her male client, and the film ends with Jeanne sitting in a chair, motionless, staring blankly ahead.""Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles"" is a groundbreaking film that explores the monotony and psychological impact of domestic drudgery. The film's slow, deliberate pace and repetitive structure reflect Jeanne's inner turmoil and mental disintegration, and the climax is a shocking and visceral reminder of the dangerous consequences of repressed emotion."

During WWII. Italian national Neapolitan Pasqualino Frafuso is a big-talking layabout who has grand ideas of his importance, especially in upholding the honor of his family, consisting of his mother and his less-than-attractive seven sisters. He admits to himself that he too is less than handsome, but believes he nonetheless attracts the romantic interest of most women. In upholding his sisters' honor he often calls himself Pasqualino Settebellezze, translated Pasqualino ""Seven Beauties"". Having gone AWOL from military service, he has just gotten off a train as a stowaway in an unknown locale when he meets another AWOL soldier, Francesco. They correctly assume that they're somewhere in Germany. Relaying his less-than-direct ""point A to point B"" story of how he arrived at this point, Pasqualino tells one in which every conscious decision was what he thought would be the path of greatest ease for himself in less-than-ideal circumstances, beginning with accidentally killing his sister Concettina's pimp (and, according to her, her lover and fiancé), declaring insanity in the ensuing legal battles rather than going to prison, and choosing military service rather than continue to endure medical intervention, such as shock treatment, at the psychiatric hospital. Pasqualino and Francesco are quickly captured by the Nazis and sent to a POW camp.

In the eighteenth century, in a small village in Ireland, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a young farm boy in love with his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). When Nora gets engaged to British Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), Barry challenges him to a duel of pistols. He wins and escapes to Dublin, but is robbed on the road. Without an alternative, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years War. He deserts and is forced to join the Prussian Army, where he saves the life of his Captain and becomes his protégé and spy of Irish gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). He helps Chevalier and becomes his associate until he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). They move to England and Barry, in his obsession of nobility, dissipates her fortune and makes a dangerous and revengeful enemy.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The rise and fall of the adult life of Irishman Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), who, in his later life, would be known as Barry Lyndon, from the mid to late eighteenth century, is presented. Growing up in humble means, largely due to the early death of his aspiring lawyer father, the potential family breadwinner, Barry strives to live up to the standards of being a gentleman in every respect of the word, including monetarily. He leads a disjointed early adult life in trying to find his way, sometimes being unfairly given some hard knocks as the ways of the world work around him. He seems to find his stride in falling in love with wealthy and married Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), who he ends up marrying following the death of her elderly first husband, Sir Charles Lyndon (Frank Middlemass). In taking over the affairs of the Lyndon mansion, Barry is able to live a means of his liking, all off the Lyndon's now quickly dwindling wealth due to Barry's squandering. As Barry is without money of his own, Mrs. Barry (Marie Kean) encourages her son to work toward a peerage as a means to have money of his own, as she fears that if Lady Lyndon were to die, she would leave all of what would remain of the Lyndon wealth to her son, Barry's stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali), with whom Barry has always had an antagonistic relationship to the point of Lord Bullingdon wanting revenge on the woes that his stepfather has created in their lives. Outwardly, Lord Bullingdon may seem to be the cause of Barry's fall, however, it may be more attributed to Barry being unable to adapt to any of the lives into which he is thrust to truly reach his goal of being a gentleman.—Huggo A gentlemanly rogue travels the battlefields and parlors of eighteenth century Europe determined to make for himself the life of a nobleman through seduction, gambling, and duelling in this methodical movie showing the rhythm and life of the period.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a young, roguish Irishman who's determined, in any way, to make a life for himself as a wealthy nobleman. Enlisting in the British Army, fighting in the Seven Years War in Europe, Barry deserts from the British Army, joins the Prussian Army, gets promoted to the rank of a spy, then becomes pupil to con artist and gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). Barry then lies, dupes, duels, and seduces his way up the social ladder and enters into a lustful but loveless marriage to a wealthy countess named Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), takes the name of ""Barry Lyndon"", settles in England with wealth and power beyond his wildest dreams, then slowly falls dramatically into ruin.—matt-282 PART I: By what means Redmond Barry acquired the style and title of Barry Lyndon.In the opening scene, set in 1750s Ireland, the father of Irishman Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is killed in a duel by a businessman over a disputed sale of some horses. This detail is related by the film's narrator (the voice of Michael Horden), who comments ironically on the events that transpire. The widow (Marie Kean), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to the raising of her son.While still in his teens, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). A wealthy English army officer named Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) meets and begins courting Nora, leading the jealous Barry to challenge Quin to a duel. Barry's second in the duel is his older friend, Captain Jack Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), and also present are Barry's cousins, Ulick and Mick Brady. They fire pistols at ten paces. When Barry's gunfire knocks Quin flat, the Brady cousins pronounce him dead and urge Barry to flee to avoid a murder charge. Believing that he has killed Quin and will be arrested by the British for murder, Barry flees.On the road to Dublin, Barry is robbed and his horse stolen by a middle-aged highwayman (Arthur O'Sullivan) and the man's son. Penniless, Barry manages to stop at a nearby town where he attends a gathering of locals where a British army recruiting officer is advertising enlistments for men in the Royal British Army, promising glory in the current war in continental Europe as well as a lifelong pension. Barry enlists in the British army and finds himself in boot camp. During training, Barry gets into a brawl with a local bully named O'Toole (Pat Roach), and is forced to fight bare-knuckle against the guy. Barry wins the fight by dodging all of O'Toole's blows and knocks out his opponent, which earns him popularity from the rest of his fellow recruits.After basic training, Barry and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. While still in a training camp, Barry is reunited with his old friend, Captain Grogan. One evening in the privacy of Grogan's tent, he tells Barry that Captain Quin is not dead after all and has married Nora. The whole duel was a ploy by Nora's relatives to make Barry flee from Ireland so she can marry Quin.During Barry's first ""taste of conflict"" during a skirmish on August 1, 1759 at the Battle of Minden, Grogan is killed, along with many other British soldiers, during the battle with a French rearguard. Over the next year-and-a-half, Barry becomes fed up with the brutality of war. One day, Barry takes an opportunity when he is able to steal the uniform and horse of Lt. Jonathan Fakenham, an army dispatcher, while Frakenham is bathing in a nearby stream with his gay lover.Posing as a British officer, Barry travels through the allied German states along the Rhine, hoping to get to neutral Holland and from there hopefully get back to Ireland. Barry has a brief affair with a local German woman (Diana Koerner) whom he shacks up with while her husband is away at war.Later, while traveling up the Rhine River to the north on horseback, Barry meets a Prussian officer, Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Kruger) and his staff, who quickly sees through his disguise. That evening at a local tavern, Potzdorf becomes more nosy and asks Barry many questions about himself and his ""mission"" as a courier. After catching Barry in a series of lies, Potzdorf exposes Barry as a British army deserter. Given the choice of joining the Prussian army or being turned back over to the British where he will no doubt be executed as a deserter, Barry enlists in his second army. After Barry saves Potzdorf's life by dragging him out of a burning house during a battle with French troops, Barry is promoted and receives a special commendation from the Prussian king, Frederick the Great.Two years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by the Prussian Minister of Police, Potzdorf's uncle. It is arranged for him to become the servant of the Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee), a professional gambler. The Prussians suspect that he is a spy and Barry is assigned to try to determine if he is. However, Barry discovers that the Chevalier is an expatriate Irishman like himself. After an attack of conscience, Barry immediately confesses his mission to the Chevalier and becomes his protege while continuing his charade of spying on him for Potzdor. Barry assists the Chevalier in cheating at card games, but when the Prince of Tübingen (Wolf Kahler) suspects the truth after losing a large sum of money, Potzdorf decides to expel the Chevalier from the country. Barry relays this to the Chevalier who persuades Barry to take advantage of this to flee Prussia. The Chevalier flees from his house during the night and crosses the border. The next day, Barry impersonates the Chevalier by donning his wig and clothes, so when Potzdorf arrives to take him to the border of Prussia and Saxony, Barry rejoins the Chevalier, both free at last.Over the next several years, Barry and the Chevalier become successful gamblers as they travel through Europe and gain access to high society. They wander from place to place, cheating the nobles at card games. Barry proves to be very useful; when a loser refuses to pay his debts, Barry's excellent swordsmanship, which he learned during his military service, convinces him otherwise. Seeing that his life of being a drifter and gambler is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. Some time later, at a gambling table in Spa, Belgium, he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). After Barry has an argument with Lady Lyndon's aged and terminally sick husband (Frank Middlemass), he suffers a heart attack and dies.PART II: Containing an account of the misfortunes and disasters which befell Barry Lyndon.The following year (on June 15, 1773), Lady Lyndon and Barry are married at a small church in London and Barry takes her last name of Lyndon and settles in England with wealth at last. The Chevalier is the best man at Barry's wedding and afterwords, he wishes Barry luck with his new life and goes off on his own. Young Lord Bullingdon (Dominic Savage), Lady Lyndon's 10-year-old son by Sir Charles, hates Barry from the beginning, knowing that Barry is an adventurer and ""common opportunist"" and is not in love with his mother.In this second part, Barry undergoes a character transformation from being ambitious, naive and innocent, into a self-destructive and arrogant man who becomes corrupted by his newly acquired wealth and power. The marriage between Barry and Lady Lyndon is not a happy one, although they welcome a new son born the following year, whom they name Bryan Patrick. Barry is unfaithful to her, and expends most of Lady Lyndon's fortune in an effort to ingratiate himself with those who could assist him in his quest to become a peer of the realm while keeping his wife and children in dull seclusion. One day, she observes Barry consorting with her maid and feels humiliated, but when Barry approaches her in her bath to apologize, she forgives him. However, young Bullingdon does not forgive Barry, and when he reminds Lady Lyndon that Sir Charles is his true father, Barry takes him out of the room to horsewhip him.As the years pass, Barry dotes on the sweet-natured Bryan, while Bullingdon's hatred intensifies. Barry brings his mother over from Ireland to live with him on the estate grounds. After meeting with Lady Lyndon as well as her son Lord Bullingdon (now a teenager played by Leon Vitali), Barry's mother privately warns her son that his position is precarious. If Lady Lyndon were to die, all of her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon; Barry and his son Bryan would be left penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. Following his mother's advice, Barry cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover (André Morell) with this goal in mind, spending much money to grease his way to the top of the social ladder. Barry gains access to more of high society and even once meets with the British king George III at a reception in London. To that end, Barry discusses the issue with former government minister, Lord Hallam, who refers him to Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Wendover. The Earl, making no promises, is willing to consider backing Barry, but says that there must be no question of his worthiness. Barry spends more money lavishly to buy lands and expensive paintings, to entertain those most likely to advance him and make bribes in high places. One day in the boys' schoolroom, when Bullingdon and the usually congenial Bryan quarrel, Barry whips Bullingdon. The viscount, now grown, threatens that next time he will kill Barry.One day during a lavish birthday party for Lady Lyndon that Barry holds in her honor, Lord Bullingdon crashes the party and announces his hatred of his stepfather. Bullingdon vows to leave his home and never return as long as his mother is married to Redmond Barry whom he continues to badmouth as a ""Irish underling"". The hot-tempered Barry physically attacks Lord Bullingdon and beats him up in front of all of the important guests which puts a quick end to the party. Humiliated by this public brawl, Bullingdon never the less makes good on his word and leaves the family estate and England itself for parts unknown. However, Barry's public cruelty towards his unruly stepson loses him all the powerful friends he has worked so hard to make and he is shunned socially. From then on, Barry is considered an outcast by good society, although they do not admit this to his face. At once, his bills become due and are paid by Lady Lyndon's income.In contrast to the mistreatment he gave Lord Bullingdon, Barry proves to be a doting and compassionate father to Bryan. Barry now focuses all his attention on raising his son Bryan. Over the next year-and-a-half, Barry cannot refuse the young boy anything and spoils him every chance he gets, giving Bryan everything that he never had as a young child growing up in poverty in Ireland. Barry even purchases a pony for Bryan to ride despite the fact that the young boy is not a good enough rider. Bryan says that all he wants is a horse (not a pony), so he can go hunting with his father. However, on Bryan's 9th birthday, despite his parents stern orders not to ride his new horse without the company of his parents, the spoiled and rotten boy disobeys them anyway and is thrown while riding from his horse and dies three days later from a head injury.The grief-stricken Barry turns to drink and isolates himself even further, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt (Murray Melvin), tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. Mrs. Barry takes over the management of Castle Hackton while Barry and Lady Lyndon mourn. After a few weeks, Mrs. Barry dismisses Reverend Runt partly because they no longer need a tutor (mostly because of Barry's past spending habits), partly for what she says is fear that his influence is making Lady Lyndon worse. Plunging even deeper into grief, she attempts suicide by taking poison, but survives and is taken to a nearby clinic to recover. The Reverend and the family's accountant and emissary Graham (Philip Stone) then seek out Lord Bullingdon. Upon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentleman's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon. Bullingdon demands ""satisfaction"" for Barry's public assault by challenging him to a duel.The duel with pistols is held in a tithe barn. A coin-toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot. Barry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously fires into the ground, but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received ""satisfaction"". In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg. At a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate. A few days later, Bullingdon sends a very nervous Graham to the cottage where Barry is recovering to offer him a deal: Bullingdon will grant Barry a small annuity of 500 guineas for life if he leaves England forever and ends his marriage to Lady Lyndon; otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, his creditors will see to it that he is put in jail.

Shivers,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073705/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The residents of a suburban high-rise apartment building are being infected by a strain of parasites that turn them into mindless, sex-crazed fiends out to infect others by the slightest sexual contact. A scientist living in an apartment complex kills a girl and uses acid to destroy her internal organs, and then kills himself. While investigating, a doctor discovers that the scientist was doing experiments on the use of genetically engineered parasites as organ transplants. Soon, other people in the complex begin showing signs of carrying the parasites, spreading the things through wanton orgiastic abandon, and the complex begins suffering an attrition problem.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> In the fancy Starliner compound in an island near Montréal, a mad scientist tests a parasite in the body of his mistress. He believes that human is an animal that thinks too much, and he develops a parasite to increase the violence and sexual desire of humankind. There is an outbreak in the condominium, with the dwellers becoming fierce zombies of sex.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil At Starliner Towers, a modern high-rise apartment complex on Starliner Island located just outside Montreal, prospective tenants are welcomed by the smarmy manager Merrick. In one of the apartment, Dr. Emil Hobbes, attacks a young woman, named Annabelle, who wears a school uniform. He strangles Annabelle to death, slices open her stomach, and pours acid in before slitting his own throat.In another apartment, Nicholas Tudor, sits in front of a bathroom mirror, apparently suffering from stomach convulsions. Tudor goes to Annabelle's apartment, and recoils from the scene of carnage, but leaves without telling anyone about it.The two bodies are found by a resident doctor who calls the police. The resident doctor, Roger St. Luc, is quite calm about it as the paramedics carry the bodies away. St. Luc goes to the office of Hobbes medical partner, Rollo Linsky, who describes the project they were working on which Rollo explains it as: ""a parasite that can take over the function of a human organ"", and he also reveals Hobbes' penchant for pedophilia, telling St. Luc that he was once caught ""examining a young girl's breasts for cancer"" when the girl was 12 years old.Meanwhile, Nick Tudor's neglected and concerned wife, Janine, seeks advice from St. Luc about her husband's sickness and reluctance to see a doctor. At the same time, Tudor leaves work early and goes home to Starliner Towers after more convolutions. At his apartment, he vomits what appears to be feaces over the balcony, just as two old women pass below. It thumps onto one of the women's umbrella, startling them. They think a dead bird landed on them due to the blood-stained splat on the umbrella. The fecal parasite slithers away into the undergrowth.In the laundry room of the building, an old woman investigates a trail of brown slime leading from an open window to a washing machine. As she lifts the lid, the parasite hurtles out and clamps onto her cheek. She tries to pull it off but cannot.At Dr. St. Luc's office, an elderly man complains to the doctor about stomach lumps saying that he may have caught them as a sexually transmitted disease from ""the girl in 1511"" - Annabelle Brown.Meanwhile, a distressed Janine Tudor visits her friend Betts to confide in her about Nick's recent behavior. Betts tells Janine to give Nick some space while she clearly makes sly remarks to Janine about how she looks. When Janine returns to the apartment, Nick has passed out on the kitchen floor after throwing up blood.In a corridor, two children play door knocking pranks until a parasite appears in the mail box opener at one of the doors (the Tudor apartment) and the kids flee away in terror.Inside the Tudor apartment, Nick callously dismisses Janine's worry about his health. When he is alone, he lays on his bed and encourages his chest lumps to move, talking to them as if he is talking to a pet. Meanwhile, Betts runs a bath, listening to a radio announcement about the murder and suicide at Starliner Towers.In the building physician's office, Dr. St. Luc seems indifferent to the amorous advances from his nurse, Miss Forsythe. They are interrupted by the telephone. Linsky calls St. Luc from Hobbes office downtown where he found Hobbes notes, which far exceed their original project. According to Linsky reading one paper, Hobbes wrote: ""Man is an animal who thinks too much"", and had a vision about creating a parasite which was ""a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease that will hopefully turn the world into one mindless orgy"". He was also using Annabelle as a guinea pig for his experiment and that he infected with a parasite through sexual contact but when she got out of control he killed her since she could infect others with the parasites. St. Luc tells Linsky that apparently Annabelle was very sexually active and infected three or four men at Starliner Towers and explains about the few cases of stomach lumps already and mentions that Janine Tudor's husband may have been one of Annabelle's sexual partners. Linsky arranges to meet them later in Tudor's apartment to confirm and warns St. Luc about encountering anyone at the building complex behaving in a strange way.Meanwhile, Betts continues to relax while soaking in her bath, unaware of the parasite forcing its way up through the plughole and heading right for the nearest orifice. Betts screams and struggles as the bathwater turns red and thrashes in agony...At this point, the chaos really begins as it reaches inexorable ascendancy. Nurse Forsythe stabs a sex-crazed man who attacks her in her apartment. St. Luc arrives just as the infected man flees. He takes a sample of the infected man's blood for the lab to examine.At the same time, a parasite attacks an old French-speaking couple in the corridor before being impaled on the end of the old lady's walking frame. Soon, more assault by residents on others become more frequent. The old lady from the laundry room attacks a delivery man who shows up near her door. The infected delivery man then attacks a young woman and her little daughter in an elevator. Then the delivery man and infected woman and girl attack and infect the lobby security guard, and so on...Nick attempts to seduce Janine, but she resists when she feels the lumps moving in his stomach. At the same time, St. Luc finds the old French couple who tell him about their encounter with the parasite. While Nurse Forsythe keeps them company, the doctor the searches the basement dumpster where the old man claims to have threw the dead parasite, but gets ambushed by another infected man. Dr. St. Luc overpowers his assailant and unhesitatingly beats him to death.Afraid over what is happening to Nick, Janine is standing by her man as he sleeps... until a bloody parasite emerges from his mouth onto the pillow beside her. In a state of shock, she runs out of the apartment and into Betts... whom is also infected.Nurse Forsythe then leaves the elderly French couple and decides to try to leave from the building.St. Luc goes to Merrick's office and tells him to call the police. By now a zombie-like mob of people infected by the parasites is roaming all the corridors of Starliner Towers. The mob breaks into the old French couple's apartment and apparently infects them as well.In the basement garage, St. Luc finds Nurse Forsythe about to be raped by the infected security guard, and he shoots the man in the back, killing him with a gun that he takes from the guard. After attempting to escape from the car park, they are rammed by one of the 'crazies'. They try to get out on foot, but find the garage door closed and locked, and several 'crazies' approaching them. They are forced to flee back into the building. St. Luc and the injured Nurse Forsythe hide in the basement, waiting for the police to show up.In the lobby of the building, a young couple complains to Merrick (clearly infected at this point) about the disturbances. He ushers them into his office where the couple are immediately pounced on by a delirious group of orgyists and are infected as well.In Betts apartment, she comforts Janine, stroking her hair and leaning in close. She tells Janine that she always had a crush on her. As the two of them kiss, a parasite exchange takes place and Janine becomes infected.A little later, Linsky arrives at the Starliner Towers and hears distant noises, but nobody is around the lobby or anywhere else. He goes up to the Tudor apartment and finds the door wide open. Tudor is lying on the bed, his stomach seething with parasites. One of them lunges at Linsky who tries tearing them off with pliers. As Dr. Linsky stabbs the parasite with a kitchen knife, he is attacked and beaten to death by Tutor, who tears the parasite off the dead Linsky's face and crams it into his own mouth as an act of ownership.In the basement, Nurse Forsythe relates a dream she had about an old man saying: ""he tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh, that disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other, that even dying is an act of eroticism"". A parasite appears crawling out of her mouth, and St. Luc knows right away that she is infected. He punchers her unconscious. As he carries her along a corridor containing storage lockers for the residents, the wooden wall panels burst apart and a sea of arms break through, reaching at them. St. Luc is forced to leave the infected Forsythe behind and runs to Tudor's apartment. He encounters Tudor in the kitchen kneeling over Linsky's bloody corpse. St. Luc shoots Nick Tudor dead. He then tries to escape from the building, but finds all the exits blocked. He encounters a gay couple trying to get at him, then an old man with a young girl in another apartment.St. Luc makes his way to the indoor swimming pool where he sees the infected Betts and Janine there fooling around. St. Luc finds an open patio door and walks out. Sensing that he is free, he runs away from the pool area and outdoor patio and up a grass river embankment only to be confronted by HUNDREDS of ""changed"" people slowly and silently advancing towards him. Forced to retreat back into the pool area, he is pushed into the pool where the infected Betts, Janine, and even Nurse Forsythe await. As the mob of 'crazies' jump in and attack him from all directions, St. Luc finally loses his struggle to remain 'human' and allows the mob to consume him.In the final scene, the time is 5:26 a.m. about an hour before dawn as a radio announcement describes a wave of unexplained sexual assaults across Montreal and the surrounding area which may have originated at Starliner Towers and that the authorities as well as the centers for disease control are currently investigating a possible epidemic of some kind. The final shots over the end credits show a long line of cars with infected people leaving Starliner Island and driving across the bridge leading to Montreal and the rest of the outside world...."
Deep Red,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073582/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A jazz pianist and a wisecracking journalist are pulled into a complex web of mystery after the former witnesses the brutal murder of a psychic. A psychic who can read minds picks up the thoughts of a murderer in the audience and soon becomes a victim. An English pianist gets involved in solving the murders, but finds many of his avenues of inquiry cut off by new murders, and he begins to wonder how the murderer can track his movements so closely.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> During a special conference on the paranormal, a renowned psychic gets a strange message that a killer is in the audience, and is rushed back to her apartment where she is brutally killed by an unknown assailant.

After both have hit dead ends with their respective investigations, they put aside their differences and decide to try to solve it together.

As they continue to investigate, a friend makes an important contribution: Armed with this new clue, they start putting the clues together and race to stop the killer before he strikes again. A jazz pianist witnesses the bloody murder of a psychic who lives in his building. Disturbed by his inability to understand the significance of a detail he saw at the scene of the crime, he partners with a journalist in an attempt to solve the mystery. Gradually, they unravel a web of secrets, but the serial killer is one step ahead.—Molly Rose Steed In the opening shot, while a child's song is playing in the background, a scream is heard, a unknown bloody knife is thrown to the floor, and a youngsters feet stand by the knife.Marcus Daly (David Hemmings) a British jazz pianist is conducting some music and tells the musicions that the music must be more perfect.At the same time, Helga Ulmann (Macha Meril) is at a lecture with Professor Giordani (Glauco Mauri) and Mario Bardi. During the presentation, Helga reacts violently to a premonition of a ""twisted mind"" and she says ""you have killed, and you will kill again!"" Helga also mentions a singing child. Someone in the audience gets up a leaves. Later, Helga tells Giordani that she may know who the killer is and that she will write it down and tell him tomorrow.At Helga's apartment, she is on the phone with her German publisher when she hangs up after hearing a children's song being played in the background. A minute later, the front doorbell rings. Helga gets up to answer it when she has a bad psychic vibe and backs away from the door. Just then the door bursts open and the killer (unseen except for wearing a brown raincoat and black leather gloves) bursts in and attacks her with a meat cleaver, stabbing her several times. Leaving her for dead, the killer then takes Helga's notes and begins to look through her papers while Helga tries crawling away.Down in the square below Helga's apartment, Marcus is talking with his constantly inebriated friend Carlo (Gabriele Lavia). Shorly after Carlo leaves, Marcus looks up and sees a bloody Helga crash through her apartment window. Marcus runs up to Helga's apartment, helps her dead body out of the broken window, and sees a person in a brown raincoat running away through the square. A little later, the police arrive and question Marcus about witnessing the killing. Marcus feels that something from the apartment is missing but cannot put his finger on what it is. Just then Gianna Brezzi (Daria Nicolodi) a fiesty photojournalist, enters the apartment, but is told to stay away by the lead detective. After his interogation, Marcus speaks with a drunk Carlo again in the square where he thinks he remembers a paint when initially entering Helga's apartment, but later was not able to locate it.At Helga's funeral, Gianna suggests that she and Marcus work together to find the killer on their own. Marcus sarcasticly thanks her for printing his name in the local newspaper and declaring him a witness which would make it easier for the killer to come after him. After discussing Helga's premonition with Giordani and Mario, and seeing Carlo to talk about the mysterious missing painting, Marcus goes to his aparment to compose some music. He soon hears the children's song, followed by the sounds of his door creaking open. As the phone rings, Marcus jumps up and pulls the door to his room shut, just when the unseen killer attacks. The killer leaves and whispers threats to him before leaving.The next day, Marcus goes to a record store and after going through albums of children's music, finds the song he heard. Mario tells him a folktake involving a haunted house in which a singing child is heard, followed by the shreiking of someone being murdered.In investigating the source of the music tune, the search leads Marcus to a novel which was written by a cerain Amanda Righetti (Giuliana Calandra), titled 'House of the Screaming Child' which describes a long-ago murder. In attempting to find Amanda Righetti to talk to her about her book, the unseen killer arrives at Righetti's villa first and murders her. The female author is stabbed in the spine, then dragged into a bathroom and drowned in a bath filled with scaldingly hot water. But Righetti manages to write a message on the wall of the steam-filled bathroom before expiring. Marcus finds the body, but aware that the police will think he did it, leaves the area without calling anyone.Marcus removes a photo of the supposed haunted house from the novel to help him in his search for the mysterious house. The photograph shows some exotic palm trees on the house grounds. Marcus tracks down the greenhouse owner who admits to selling a dozen or more Canary Island palms to that house, and procures the house's address from past records. Driving around, Marcus finally locates the house and learns from the caretaker who claims that no one have lived in the house before 1963 when the previous owner was killed. Marcus looks around and discovers a children's drawing on a wall long plastered over of a little boy holding a unknown bloody knife next to a murdered man.Meanwhile, Giordani investigates the Righetti murder scene after the police collect the body and leave, and on a hunch, turns on the hot water in the bathroom and sees part of the message left on the wall by murder victim. When Giordani returns to his office that night to investigate more, the unseen killer breaks in and kills him too - first by bashing his face against his desk, and then stabbing him through the neck.When Marcus learns of Giordani's murder, he makes plans to leave town but then discovers the clue that he overlooked in the photo of the deserted house: a window on one of the walls is missing. Marcus returns to the house after dark and after unsuccessfully trying to bash in the wall where the window was, which leads to him nearly falling off the scaffolding, he enters the house and using a pickaxe, bashes down an end-wall in a hallway and discovers the secret room with a rotting skeleton next to a Christmas tree. But the unseen killer arrives and knocks Marcus out. When he regains consciousness, he finds the house on fire, and Gianna by his side who arrived in the nick of time to pull him out of the house.Marcus and Gianna go to the villa caretaker's house to call the police and fire department when Marcus discovers that the caretaker's young daughter, Olga, had drew an identical drawing of the little boy with a bloody knife standing next to a Christmas tree with the murder victim. Olga tells them that she found the drawing and copied it from old file archives at her junior high school. Marcus and Gianna break into the Da Vinci Junior High School to search the archives for the drawing, when Gianna is stabbed by the killer and Marcus finds the painting, with the name on it which is Carlo, who appears before Marcus holding a gun and threatening to kill him for getting too close. Just then, the police led by the superintendent Calcabrini arrive and Carlo flees, but in a twist of fate, he gets sideswiped by a passing garbage truck which he gets hooked onto the fender and gets dragged down the street to his gruesome death.With the case apparently wrapped up with Carlo being the killer, Marcus drops off the severely wounded Gianna at the hospital, but in going back to the scene of the crime, tries to remember what he thought he saw. Carlo could not have murdered Helga Ulmann because he was with Marcus on the street when they saw the killer stabbing Ulmann. Marcus enters the murder victim's apartment and, after looking around, finally remembers what he saw in a mirror reflection that night: the face of the killer.The identity of the killer is finally revealed to be Carlo's insane mother Martha (Clara Calamai). Martha suddenly appears in the apartment and reveals everything to Marcus; when Carlo was still a child, he watched as his mother murdered his father when he tried to have her committed to a mental hospital. The young Carlo and mother then entombed the body in a room of their house.Wielding a meat cleaver, Martha chases Marcus around the complex and into the foyer with an elevator. Marcus gets hit in the shoulder by the cleaver, and, in the process, he kicks Martha toward the elevator shaft. Her excessively long necklace slips in through the crossed metal bars. She tries to pull herself away and, in doing so, the large pendant on the end of the necklace becomes lodged between two small metal bars. As Martha is desperately trying free her necklace, Marcus Daly realizes she is caught and presses the button to activate the lift. It travels downward and the necklace starts choking her tightly. Her hands are clad in black leather gloves, making her fingers much too thick to slip in-between her neck and the necklace to try and save herself before it's too late. The elevator provides so much force that the necklace ends up cutting through her neck, decapitating her... creating a huge 'deep red' bloodstain all over the marble floor."

This adaptation of the famous short story by Rudyard Kipling tells the story of Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. They decide that the country is too small for them, so they head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right. Kipling is seen as a character that was there at the beginning, and at the end of this glorious tale.—Greg Bole <bole@life.bio.sunysb.edu> This movie is about two ambitious ex-soldiers stationed in India who set out to become the rulers of an entire country. After finishing their tour of duty in India, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan have decided that India is ""too small for the likes of them"", so they decide to bribe a local ruler and extort money from him, in order to buy twenty Martini rifles, which they will use to take over villages in Kafristan. They face many challenges and perils along the way, including difficult terrain, hostile natives, freezing temperatures, and an avalanche high in the mountains. They eventually come to a small village, Urheb, where they meet Ootah and Billy Fish, an Indian who speaks English. He then becomes their translator. They then train the natives of this village to use the rifles, and soon conquer village after village. During a battle, Daniel is struck by an arrow that seemingly sticks out of his chest. The ignorant natives believe that he must be a God for not having died, and fall down and begin worshipping him. Daniel and Peachy decide that it would be easier for a ""God "" to take over the country, so they pretend that Daniel is a god, the son of Alexander the Great who has returned after two thousand two hundred years to again rule Kafristan. The entire country celebrated the return of their new ruler, the Son of Segunda (Alexander). As a token of their admiration, the holiest of holy men gives Daniel all of the gold and riches left by Alexander in 328 B.C. It is enough to make them the richest men in the world. All goes well until Daniel's ego and greed gets the best of him. He asks Peachy to bow when he walks in front of him. He later tells Peachy that he has decided to stay, and now believes that he is the son of Alexander (""in spirit, anyways""), and that to fulfill his destiny, he will marry Roxanne, like his ""father"" Alexander did before him. The Kafiri's believe that a mortal cannot marry a God, but Daniel goes ahead anyway. Peachy was set to leave with his share of the treasure, but Daniel convinced him to stay ""for old time's sake"" for the wedding. At the ceremony, Roxanne, believing that she would soon die, bites Daniel, drawing blood. The entire crowd realizes that since Danny is bleeding, that he is a man, not a God, and that he has been deceiving them the entire time. Peachy grabs Daniel and they run off with their twenty soldiers, shooting at the crowd of monks who set out to kill them. They are eventually captured, and Daniel is forced to walk out on a rope bridge. The monks cut the ropes, and Daniel bravely falls to his death. Peachy is later crucified. When they come to see him the next day, he is still alive, and they say that it is a miracle that he lived, and they cut him down. He eventually climbs down into the valley and retrieves Danny's head, still wearing the crown. He brings it back to Rudyard Kipling, a writer for the Northern Star, as proof that Daniel accomplished his goal, and became the King of Kafristan. Themes developed in the story: 1. ambition 2. friendship 3. taking risks 4. perseverance (not giving up) 5. power 6. honor and dignity.—Thom Anderson Newspaper correspondent Rudyard Kipling is startled to get a visit from a man in miserable state, who reveals to be Peachy Carnehan, the swindler who, with his army vet buddy in crime and adventure, Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot, set out to make their fortune in Kafiristan, a backward Himalayan tribal warfare zone outside the British viceroy's colonial sway. Peachy explains how they nearly died in the mountains, found an expedition's Gurkha sole survivor, took charge of a tribe and started conquering. Then a freakish arrow incident lead the natives to believe Danny invulnerable, hence Sikander, the long-expected divine son of Alexander the Great, and therefore made him theocratic King of all Kafiristan. But even if ruling went surprisingly well, living up to a god's expectation pattern didn't.—KGF Vissers Lahore, British India, 1885.While working late one night as a correspondent at the offices of the Northern Star newspaper in India, Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer) is approached by a ragged, seemingly crazed derelict, who reveals himself to be his old acquaintance Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine). Peachy begins to tell Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms Daniel ""Danny"" Dravot (Sean Connery) traveled to remote Kafiristan (in modern-day Afghanistan; the province is now known as Nuristan), became ""gods"", and ultimately lost everything.Three years earlier.Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances; Carnehan, a former Colour sergeant of the Queen's Own Royal Loyal Light Infantry, pick-pocketed Kiplings's pocket watch but was forced to return it as he was a fellow Freemason. Carnehan claims to be an expert in ""whiskey, women, waistcoats, and bills of fare."" Both Dravot and Carnehan are in the process of blackmailing a local Rajah by posing as newspaper correspondents of ""The Northern Star"" newspaper, which outrages the real correspondent (Kipling). To save their lives, Kipling has the local district commissioner arrest both Dravot and Carnehan, who obliquely blackmail the commissioner himself.Despite being accomplished gun smugglers, swindlers, fencers of stolen goods, con-men, and blackmailers, both of them are bitter that after fighting to make India part of the British Empire, they will have little to return home apart from dead-end jobs. Both Dravot and Carnehan turn up at Kipling's office and explain their biggest gamble yet: feeling that India is too small for men such as them, they intend to travel to Kafiristan, a small and remote country to help a local king overcome his enemies, overthrow him, and become ""gods""/rulers themselves before stealing various riches and returning to England in triumph.After signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing drink and women until they achieved their grandiose aims, Peachy and Danny (taking along 20 Martini Henry rifles stolen from a local armory) set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the Khyber Pass. Kipling, after attempting to dissuade the men, gives Dravot his masonic emblem as a token of brotherhood. Over the next few weeks, Dravot and Carnehan travel through Afghanistan, fighting off a group of bandits at a campfire, trekking through a blizzard and avalanches as they make their way into the unknown land of Kafiristan (literally ""Land of the Infidels"").They chance upon a Gurkha soldier who goes by the name Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffrey), the sole survivor of a missing mapping expedition sent several years earlier which had been lost in an avalanche. Billy speaks English as well as the local Dari language. Acting as translator and interpreter of customs and manners, he smooths the path of Dravot and Carnehan as they begin their rise, offering their services as military advisers, trainers, and war leaders to the chief of the much-raided village of Er-Heb. Dravot and Carnehan muster a force to attack the villagers' most-hated enemy, the Bashkai. During the battle, Dravot is struck in the chest by an arrow, but is unharmed, leading the natives to believe that he is a god. In fact, the arrow was stopped by a bandolier hidden beneath his clothing. As victory follows victory, the defeated are recruited to join the swelling army.Finally, nobody is left to stand in their way, and they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul, where the chief high priest, Kafu Selim, sets up a re-enactment of the arrow incident, to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds. When Dravot flinches, the monks grab him and open his shirt to stab him, only to be stopped by Dravot's Masonic jewel. By coincidence, the symbol on the jewel matches one known only to the highest holy man, the symbol of ""Sikander"" (a linguistic corruption of Alexander the Great), who had conquered the country thousands of years before and promised to return. The holy men are convinced Dravot is the immortal son of Sikander. They hail him as king and lead the two men down to storerooms heaped with treasure (gold, silver, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, among various jewels) that belonged to Sikander, which now belongs to Dravot.As the months pass, Carnehan is anxious to leave with the treasure before winter arrives and heavy snow closes the mountain passes (and before the natives learn the truth about them). Dravot, however, has developed delusions of grandeur. First, Dravot 'suggests' that Carnehan bow to him like the others, ostensibly to ""keep up appearances"" in front of the natives and continue the deception. He adjudicates disputes among local people and villages, and issues proclamations overseeing their administration. He begins making plans to turn the land into a modern country, to the extent that he envisages eventually meeting Queen Victoria ""as an equal."" Resigned that Dravot's mind is made up, Carnehan decides to take as much loot as he can carry on a small mule train and leave alone.Meanwhile, Dravot decides to take a wife after seeing the beautiful Roxanne (Shakira Caine), and invites Carnehan as a witness. Roxanne, having a superstitious fear that she will burst into flames if she consorts with a god, tries frantically to escape, biting Dravot during the wedding ceremony. The bite draws blood, and the high priest exclaims that Dravot ""not a god or a devil but a man"". When everyone sees it, they realize that Dravot and Carnehan have deceived and used them. Carnehan and Billy quickly grab Dravot off the podium and hurry away.A large crowd of angry natives pursue Dravot and Carnehan, who order their loyal troops to open fire on them. As their forces and ammunition dwindle, Dravot and Carnehan offer Billy a horse to escape, but Billy refuses and courageously charges into the mob with a kukri single-handedly, before being killed amidst the mob. As the two men are soon surrounded captured, Dravot apologizes to Carnehan for spoiling their plans, and Carnehan forgives him. Now resigned to his fate, Dravot is forced to walk to the middle of a rope bridge over a deep gorge as the ropes are cut, casting him into the gorge.Afterwords, the Carnehan was crucified between two pine trees, but he was cut down the next day when he survives the ordeal. Eventually, he makes his way back to India, but his mind has become unhinged by his sufferings. In the present, as Carnehan finishes his story, he presents Kipling with Dravot's severed head, still wearing its crown, thereby confirming the tale to be true."

Crossing America, Clint gets sexually harassed on all sides by various voluptuous nymphomaniacs, and it all ends in a literally explosive climax.—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> Gas station attendant Clint Ramsey, who works at Martin Bormann's Super Service in the desert, finds himself too irresistible to a series of women, all of whom have the word ""Super"" in their given names. In the beginning, he is married to the hypersexual, demanding, and jealous SuperAngel (Shari Eubank), who constantly harasses him at work. She orders him home at once when she calls Clint and overhears a female customer, SuperLorna (Christy Hartburg), hits on him at work. Clint finds SuperAngel's constant accusations and arguing a turnoff and, back at home, they fight after he rejects her aggressive advances. A neighbor calls the police as Clint leaves for a local bar, where the bartender is the very scantily clad SuperHaji (Haji).Meanwhile, SuperAngel seduces Harry Sledge (Charles Napier), the cop who responded to the police call. He is impotent and unable to perform. She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (from insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi. Clint is then forced to flee.In his rush to escape, Clint hitchhikes a ride from a man (John LaZar) and his girlfriend SuperCherry (Colleen Brennan). During the drive, SuperCherry comes on to him and puts his hand over her breast, but then pulls it back. She then tries to give him a handjob over his pants, but he continues to resist her advances. The driver takes offense to Clint rejecting his girlfriend, but she says he probably just wants a closer contact. She again attempts and fails to seduce him and he asks the driver to let him get out. The driver follows him out and beats and robs him. Clint is found by an old farmer who takes him to his farm to heal from his injuries and Clint agrees to work for the farmer for a week to repay him.The farmer has a younger Austrian mail-order bride, SuperSoul (Uschi Digard), who is hypersexual. After energetically satisfying her husband, she comes knocking on Clint's door at night. She immediately pushes him into his bed where she proceeds to mount and rape him, until he manages to overpower her. However, she does the same the following day and this time overpowering him after jumping him from behind in the barn. Looking for SuperSoul, the farmer finds them in the barn, then chases Clint away and punches SuperSoul.Fleeing from the farm, Clint meets a motel owner and his deaf daughter, SuperEula (Deborah McGuire), who convinces him to take a ride with her in her dune buggy to have sex in the desert. They are caught by her father and chased out of town.Clint eventually meets up with SuperVixen (also played by Shari Eubank) at Supervixen's Oasis, a roadside diner. SuperVixen is (inexplicably) a friendly and giving reincarnation of SuperAngel, whose ghost now appears nude between scenes to comment on the plot from atop a bedspring balanced on a mesa. Clint and SuperVixen fall in love and are inseparable, although their common nemesis, Harry Sledge, arrives on the scene and plots ending the lives of the now happy couple."
Night Moves,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073453/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Los Angeles private investigator Harry Moseby is hired by a client to find her runaway teenage daughter. Moseby tracks the daughter down, only to stumble upon something much more intriguing and sinister. Private detective and former football player Harry Moseby gets hired on to what seems a standard missing person case, as a former Hollywood actress whose only major roles came thanks to being married to a studio mogul wants Moseby to find and return her daughter. Harry travels to Florida to find her, but he begins to see a connection between the runaway girl, the world of Hollywood stuntmen, and a suspicious mechanic when an unsolved murder comes to light.—Gary Dickerson <slug@mail.utexas.edu> In Los Angeles, the private detective and former athlete Harry Moseby is hired by the retired obscure Hollywood actress Arlene Iverson to find her 16-year-old missing daughter Delly Grastner. Harry discovers that the runaway girl has a promiscuous life and uses drugs, and he tracks down her last boyfriend Quentin, who works as a mechanic on the sets. Meanwhile, Harry finds that his wife Ellen is cheating on him, and he has difficulties in handling the situation. Then he visits stuntman Marv Ellman and stunt coordinator Joey Ziegler and follows the new lead, heading to the Florida Keys, where Delly is living with her stepfather Tom Iverson. Harry is welcomed by Paula, who works with Tom on a boat and has an open relationship with him. The reluctant Delly surprisingly agrees to return to Los Angeles with Harry to live with her mother. Harry and Ellen have a long conversation trying to solve their marriage problems. When Harry learns that Delly has died in a car crash, he suspects Quentin. But he soon finds that the initial missing person case is actually a complex smuggling operation of a valuable artifact.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Harry Moseby is a former pro football player turned Los Angeles-based private investigator, who owns his own independent firm. What he thought was his stable marriage to high-end antiques gallery manager Ellen Moseby is not, when he finds out she has been having an affair. Although she still loves Harry, Ellen believes his work - especially having to do all his own legwork in his independent agency, as opposed to working for a larger private investigation firm - is overtaking his life and their marriage. This revelation is bad timing for Harry as he starts on a new case, to locate two-week missing sixteen-year-old Delly Grastner for her mother, twice-divorced Arlene Iverson, a former bit actress. Beyond the job itself, Harry can see that Arlene's motives are not motherly love. He eventually learns that Arlene, who lives well, achieved what little success she had in the business by sleeping with the right people, and that the probable reason that she wants Delly back is that her daughter's sizable trust fund set up by Arlene's first husband, Delly's late father, is Arlene's sole means of support. When Harry believes he discovers not only Delly's reasons for running away but also to where she was running in achieving her goal, he changes the complexity of the case solely from missing person to possibly smuggling, attempted murder and multiple homicide, which have far more inherent dangers to himself. All the while, he still grapples with what to do about the broken state of his marriage.—Huggo Harry Moseby, a former pro football turned L.A. private detective, is assigned to search for a missing person in the Florida Keys. Hired by a Hollywood actress to investigate this disappearance, Moseby decides to travel to the Keys while trying to hold on to his crumbling marriage with his cheating wife, who is seeing another man. Once Moseby gets to the Keys, his investigation leads him deeper into trouble when he discovers several clues including a sunken plane and dead bodies. As Moseby's investigation continues to get deeper, he realizes that there's something particularly wrong about this case.—blazesnakes9 Four men in the movie stunt business join together to smuggle precious Mexican antiquities to the States. All are pilots except for mechanic Quentin (James Woods). One of the pilots, Tom Iverson (John Crawford), also has a charter business in the Florida Keys, used as a staging point for the smuggled goods. Iverson's girlfriend Paula (Jennifer Warren) is also in on the scheme. All of this occurs before the movie opens; all that follows happens during the film.Los Angeles private eye and former NFL player Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman) arrives at the Keys searching for Iverson's runaway, nymphet stepdaughter Delly (Melanie Griffith). Moseby was hired by Arlene Iverson, Tom's selfish ex-wife and a former actress. Arlene's only means of support is Delly, Arlene's daughter by her first husband.After Moseby takes the case, he discovers that his wife is cheating on him, but instead of talking to his wife Ellen (Susan Clark), he accosts the man she has been seeing, Marty Heller (Harris Yulin). Marty despises Harry for acting like a private eye instead of taking care of his own marital problems. Although they eventually reconcile, Ellen also despises Harry for treating her like a case subject instead of his wife.As Moseby follows the clues to Delly, he makes fast friends with stunt director Joey Ziegler (Ed Binns) who is keen to help Moseby find Delly. Moseby discovers that Quentin and stunt flier Marv Ellman (another smuggler) were both once involved with, and fought over, Delly, although Moseby has no suspicion of the other motives and machinations occurring under his nose. Moseby eventually finds Delly with Iverson and Paula in the Keys, and they allow Moseby to stay for a while as he tries to convince Delly to come back to L.A. with him.During a boating trip one night with Delly and Paula, they find Ellman's downed plane. Paula deceives Moseby about a marker she places at the crash, saying it is for the Coast Guard. It is really for Iverson who will come to the site later and retrieve the stolen goods from Ellman's plane. During this time, Paula seduces Harry to keep him occupied. Delly eventually comes back to L.A. with Moseby, finding Quentin waiting for her at Arlene's home.It is the last time Moseby sees Delly alive, with everyone at the house yelling at one another other while Harry drives away, not reflecting on the turmoil he has once again introduced into Delly's life.Arlene gets Delly some movie extra work but she dies in a car crash during a stunt in which Ziegler was driving, who lived but was badly injured. Moseby views film footage of Quentin under the car before the stunt and begins to suspect Quentin murdered Delly. Moseby confronts Quentin and accuses him of killing Delly because she discovered he killed Ellman out of jealousy. They fight but Quentin escapes. Moseby then tells Ziegler he thinks Quentin and Iverson are in on something but he doesn't know what. Moseby goes back to the Keys to find out.Moseby arrives at Iverson's charter business to find Quentin dead. Moseby then confronts Iverson who confesses to killing Quentin. Quentin thought Iverson killed Ellman to get a larger share of the smuggling proceeds, and Moseby had scared Quentin into thinking he was going to go down for Ellman's murder instead. Moseby struggles with Iverson and knocks him out, then is determined to finish things by having Paula help him locate the stolen artifacts.They find the marker previously left, and while Paula is underwater, a seaplane strafes the boat and Harry is injured. The plane lands and sees Paula surface along with a large stone sculpture. The plane runs her down but then collides with the sculpture, kicking out its pontoons. The plane then flies into the boat and begins to sink. Harry tries to get a glimpse of the pilot from the diving window built into the boat's keel: it is Ziegler, the last person he ever suspected.The movie ends with Harry unsuccessfully trying to steer the boat to shore - he succeeds only in going in circles."

Black Moon,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072709/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"To escape a gender war, a girl flees to a remote farmhouse and becomes part of an extensive family's unusual, perhaps even supernatural, lifestyle. There is a war in the world between the men and the women. A young girl tries to escape this reality and comes to a hidden place where a strange unicorn lives with a family: Sister, Brother, many children and an old woman that never leaves her bed but stays in contact with the world through her radio. Since the content of this picture is not as important as the pictures and allegories, the simple plot can not be described further.—Benjamin Stello In a dystopian future, a mid-teen named Lily is trying to escape the bloodshed associated with the war between the sexes, she barely getting away from a group of men that have just assassinated a group of women. Lily is able to take ""fantasy"" refuge on a farmhouse property, which is inhabited by among others: an old bedridden woman, who speaks largely in some foreign tongue, speaks to others over a wireless radio, has a rat named Humphrey as a friend, and receives her nourishment in an unconventional manner for a person her age; a non-speaking brother and sister both also named Lily (although his is spelled differently), who she assumes are the bedridden woman's children, and the brother who communicates through touch; a group of naked children shepherds; and a talking unicorn. Although Lily's relationships with the others are not always in harmony, especially with the elderly woman, she tries to find her rightful place there in light of the alternative.—Huggo After enjoying critical and commercial successes with Murmur of the Heart and Lacombe, Lucien, Malle decided to go for something much more experimental and free-form. Always a great fan of myth and fantasy, and especially of the work of Lewis Carroll, Malle tries to create the special, charged atmosphere of a world in which actions, objects and creatures are never quite what they seem. The film begins when the teenaged Lily (Harrison) has a road accident and discovers she's landed smack in the middle of some kind of civil war. Fleeing into a nearby field, she comes upon a lonely mansion inhabited by an old lady (Giehse) who knows how to talk to animals. Shot by the great Sven Nykvist, Black Moon offers a distinctively different approach to the theme of adolescent self-realization that has been a frequent concern in Malle's work."

While he plays the music of well known and successful composers, such asLudwig van Beethoven, and purchases the music of aspiring composers, such asRichard Wagner- Liszt's bastardization of Wagner's compositions while performing in concert not sitting well with him - Liszt himself aspires to be a great composer. It is his relationship with another of his wealthy fans, married Princess Carolyn of Russia, which tests how much Liszt is willing to give up in his life to achieve that greatness as a composer. Meanwhile, Wagner becomes a more integral part of Liszt's life out of circumstance as Wagner's life takes a more political turn.—Huggo This flamboyant extravaganza tells the scandalous tale of superstar composer Franz Liszts (Roger Daltry) hedonistic life of groupies, sex and music, as well as his rivalry with the scheming Richard Wagner (Paul Nicholas).

The Pope (Ringo Starr) forbids their marriage and Liszt attempts to adopt a monastic lifestyle. The vampiric Wagner marries Liszts daughter, Cosima, and then battles for world domination by unleashing the Viking God, Thor (Rick Wakeman), and his troupe of robot Nazis. The only way to save the world is through Liszt and all of his mistresses in a rocket ship to destroy the resurrected Wagner who has now become the Nazi Antichrist.

Inserts,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073172/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young, once-great Hollywood film director refuses to accept changing times during the early 1930s, and confines himself to his decaying mansion to make silent porn flicks. A once-great silent film director, unable to make the transition to the new talkies, lives as a near-hermit in his Hollywood home, making cheap, silent sex films, and suffering in the knowledge of his sexual impotence, and apathetic about the plans to demolish his home to make way for a highway. His producer and his producer's girlfriend come by to see how he is doing (and to supply heroin to the actress as her payment). The girlfriend stays to watch them filming, and is deeply impressed by his methods. When the actress goes to the bathroom, and dies there of an overdose, the girlfriend takes her place in the film. Then the producer returns.—Steven Pemberton <Steven.Pemberton@cwi.nl> Prior to the opening credits we see portions of a black-and-white stag film that is shot in the course of the movie. Voices are overheard that make it apparent that men and women are watching this in the present day. At the end a man complains that there was no ""Come shot"", something that will later develop into a plot point.The story takes place in Hollywood in the year 1930, shortly after the start of the talkie period. A visionary and gifted young Hollywood director known as Boy Wonder (Richard Dreyfuss) has fallen out of favor with the studios. This is ostensibly due to his reluctance to lower his standards or abandon his artistic and experimental style (such as using a hand-held camera) for the sake of churning out lesser quality stag films for easy money, due to his alcoholism and his fear of leaving his house (agoraphobia). He works out of his decaying mansion, which is the only one left on a street being turned into a freeway.On the morning of this particular shoot, a heroin-addicted waitress, named Harlene (Veronica Cartwright) arrives. Harlene was once a well-known and respected star during the silent film era and she too is reluctant to join the ranks of the ""talkies"" due in part to her unappealing, high-pitched squeaky voice. She is now the star in the first of his six-picture deal. She prepares and shoots heroin while Boy Wonder drinks heavily during a conversation between them about the changing times in Hollywood.An actor called Rex the Wonder Dog (Stephen Davies) soon arrives wearing a white suit with grass stains on his knees, having just came from his job working for a mortician. During his introduction, Rex gullibly believes a man from a studio who that says that he will put him in the mainstream talkies, and has an appointment to meet him in his hotel room later that same day.Boy Wonder awkwardly attempts to make an artistic film using an actress under the influence of heroin and an actor who becomes increasingly frustrated with the director and all of his poetic talk, much of which he admits he doesn't understand. The scene goes wrong when Rex gets out of control during the action and Boy Wonder needs to smash a wine bottle over his head to get him to stop.Enter Big Mac (Bob Hoskins), a porno film producer. He has heroin packets in his jacket pocket, an unlit cigar in his mouth, wads of money for Rex and a pretty brunette wannabe actress named Cathy Cake (Jessica Harper) hanging on his arm. Harlene takes her payment in heroin and soon dies from an overdose in an upstairs bedroom. Rex finds the dead body and everyone is terribly upset over this turn of events. Boy Wonder talks about continuing his film, but Rex refuses to perform with a dead woman.Big Mac offers Rex a part in a mainstream movie in order to convince Rex to help him bury the body and, while the two are away, Cathy and Boy Wonder develop a chemistry that eventually leads to another ironic high point in the film. Boy Wonder offers to film Cathy for insert shots of her nude body to double for the late Harlene. At first, Cathy refuses to undress, but when she does, she soon becomes aroused by Boy Wonder filming her. After a while, he makes love to her believing he has found something of a soulmate, but she is disappointed when she learns the camera was off. Boy Wonder's sexual experience with Cathy marked the end of his longstanding problem with impotence, which was evidently related to his emotional problems.Boy Wonder quickly realizes that this romantic encounter was simply a ploy to get her into the film, and that she has used and directed him the way he used and directed her. Big Mac and Rex return to find both of them half naked. In a jealous rage, Big Mac ends his six-picture stag film contract with Boy Wonder, who by this time is completely drunk. Rex beats up Boy Wonder in retribution for hitting him earlier with the wine bottle by doing likewise. Big Mac takes the film reel that Boy Wonder used and leaves with Rex and Cathy. After Boy Wonder is left alone in his home, a man knocks at the door. This is presumably Clark Gable, a then little-known actor who had been said to be intending to call on Boy Wonder about a film project. Boy Wonder will not answer the door, and after a short time the unseen man leaves. The end of the film finds Boy Wonder alone in his spacious living room, sitting in the exact same place where the film began; playing piano and singing, pondering what he'll eat for lunch.Note: This last remark brings home the fact that, while a great deal of talk and drama has occurred in the course of the nearly two-hour long film, the movie was shot in real time."

In 1964, a group of high school friends who live on the Near North Side of Chicago enjoy life to the fullest...parties, hanging out, meeting new friends. Then life changes for two of the guys when they meet a pair of career criminals and get falsely arrested in connection with stealing a Cadillac. We follow their lives through the end of high school and the dramatic end to their school year.—Anonymous Set in the year 1964, in the predominately African-American neighborhood of the Cabrini-Green project of North Chicago, high school senior LeRoy ""Preach"" Jackson (Glynn Thurman) and his best friend Richard ""Cochise"" Morris (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) attend Cooley High, a vocational all-black high school, along with their good friends Pooter (Corin Rogers), Willie (Maurice Leon Havis) and Tyrone (Joseph Carter Wilson). Although Preach has strong writing abilities and loves poetry, he continually skips classes.One afternoon after avoiding school all week, Preach returns to class on Friday, but minutes into a boring lecture on the virtues of Cooley students, he fakes a nosebleed and, joined by the others, sneaks away to spend the afternoon at the zoo. Later, the friends return too late for classes. They instead go to the neighborhood diner, named Martha's which is owned and managed by a woman of the same name (Juanita McConnell), who also works as the head cook, where their classmates dance to jukebox music, snack and, in the back near the bathroom, gamble over a dice game. As soon as they arrive at Martha's, the pair learn from a classmate named Dorothy (Lynn Caridine) that their history exam has been moved to Monday, forcing them to study over the weekend.A little later when Cochise urges Preach to leave a dice game dominated by petty crooks Stone (Sherman Smith) and Robert (Norman Gibson), the young men are startled by attractive and unflappable schoolmate Brenda (Cynthia Davis), who demands to get through their game to reach the bathroom. When the others refuse to move, Martha clears the way waving a meat cleaver threateningly. Before going home for dinner, Preach and Cochise meet their some-time girlfriends, Johnny Mae (Jackie Taylor) and Sandra (Christine Jones) to make out. Although Johnny Mae is comfortable with ""going all the way"" with Cochise, Sandra refuses to ""give anything away"" to Preach.At home that evening, Cochise's mother Melba (Lily Schine), avoids telling him whether she has received the welfare check, but admits that she has had to bail her boyfriend Jimmie Lee out of jail. Later, Cochise finds a sealed envelope floating in the toilet and, opening it carefully, reads that he has earned a sports scholarship to college the following year. After dinner, Cochise slips away to meet Preach and the others. To celebrate his news, the friends each take a sip from a wine bottle after first dripping a little on the ground ""for absent friends.""The gang then moves on to a private party thrown by Dorothy in her family's apartment as her parents are away for the evening. After Dorothy turns away Stone and Robert, Preach and Cochise scheme to get into the party without paying the 25 cent cover charge. While Tyrone flirts and charms Dorothy, Preach offers to watch the door and lets his friend sneak in for free. Once inside, Cochise spots the alluring Loretta Brown (Sharon Murff) and asks her to dance, Tyrone continues flirting with Dorothy, while Pooter cannot get any girls interested in him.Meanwhile, Preach tracks Brenda down to a back room where she is reading the poetry of Robert Browning. Although initially dubious when Preach declares he likes Browning, Brenda is moved when Preach lovingly quotes a contemporary poet. Their subsequent talk is interrupted moments later, however, by the arrival of the volatile Damon, who, spotting his usual date, Loretta, clinging to Cochise, ignores Dorothy's pleas and starts a fight.Pleased with the mayhem, the friends goes in search of Jimmy Lee (Steven Williams) at Roscoe's Lounge, but he has conned a man into paying to visit a prostitute, then stolen the man's money. When the others decide to go home, the restless, Preach and Cochise agree to cruise with Stone and Robert, unaware that they have stolen the Cadillac they are in. When Preach insists that he once drove a Maserrati sports car, Stone insists that he drive them around, only to discover that Preach does not know how to drive. Preach panics when a police car pulls up beside him at a light, and speeds off, prompting a wild chase that ends up inside a huge warehouse where the boys just manage to escape. In his excitement at escaping, Preach inadvertently plows the Cadillac into the back of another car and all the boys run away before the police arrive.The next morning, the friends meet at Willie's apartment to study for the history exam, but, growing bored, they steal Willie's little brother's Lone Ranger badge. Preach and Cochise then approach two prostitutes and threaten to arrest them unless they pay bribe money. Realizing too late that the boys are using a toy badge, the women chase after them and their money in vain. The boys spend the money by taking their girlfriends to see a movie, where a fight breaks out after Pooter inadvertently spills popcorn on someone.Later, Preach returns home, where his mother orders him to look after his younger sisters, Tooty and Dee, as she heads off to work. Expecting Brenda, Preach orders the reluctant Tooty to take their sister to a neighbor. When Brenda arrives, Preach is surprised when she confesses to being a virgin, but is also moved. After the couple has sex, in his delight Preach blurts out that he has won the dollar bet he made with Cochise that he could get Brenda to bed. Furious, Brenda storms out just as Tooty returns and catches the two together partially undressed.That Monday at school, Preach attempts to placate Brenda, but she refuses to speak to him, only to abruptly kiss him when she sees Sandra glowering nearby. History teacher Mr. Mason (Garrett Morris) then stops Preach sneaking into class to tell him that if he does not pass the exam he will also flunk the course. Before the exam can begin, however, two plain clothes detectives arrive and charge Preach and Cochise with grand theft auto.At police headquarters, the boys see that Stone and Robert have also been picked up. Each are interrogated separately, and Preach and Cochise lies contradict each other. Unknown to them Mr. Mason arrives and privately vouches for both young men as youthfully reckless but not lawless. On the teacher's word, the boys are let go, but Stone and Robert believe that the pair have implicated them.That evening, Preach climbs into an upper window to get into the house to avoid his mother, but finds a note from Tooty that Mrs. Jackson is working a to know why he was arrested and why he brought home Brenda instead of watching his sisters. Although Preach is relieved, his mother arrives soon after and demands explanations for his arrest and bringing Brenda home instead of babysitting his sisters. Ignoring his explanations, Mrs. Jackson orders Preach to get his belt so she can punish him, but by the time he has sheepishly returned, his mother has fallen into an exhausted sleep.The next day, Preach and Cochise are shocked to learn from Tyrone, Damon and others, that Stone and Robert hold them responsible for their arrest. Later, when Preach skips Mr. Mason's class, the teacher discovers him gambling in the boys' bathroom and asks why he is squandering his intellectual abilities. When Preach tells Mr. Mason that his ambition is to ""live forever,"" the exasperated teacher confesses that he is through saving him. Realizing that it was on Mr. Mason's word that he and Cochise were released from jail, Preach hurries to explain to his friend.At Roscoe's Lounge, Preach is stunned to learn that Cochise spent the afternoon in with Sandra. Angered that his best friend would betray him, Preach takes a swing at him and storms away. Going to Martha's Diner, Preach finds Brenda and, without his usual bragging air, apologizes and asks for another chance. Before he can continue, however, Preach overhears Damon greeting Stone and Robert who have just been released from jail on bail. Alarmed, Preach pleads with Brenda to meet him a few blocks away under the elevated train stop and attempts to hide in the bathroom, before Martha, wielding her cleaver, drives Stone and Robert out.As Stone and Robert's gang chase Preach away from Martha's, Cochise runs into the waiting Brenda who relates the confrontation at the diner. After Preach evades the gang by hiding in a dumpster, he picks up Brenda, but on the train when she mentions seeing Cochise, he realizes the gang will be looking for him too. While Preach disembarks at the next stop to return to Martha's neighborhood, Stone, Robert and their gang come upon Cochise and beat him savagely, finally slamming him into a metal beam. Preach finds his friend unconscious and Cochise dies while Preach calls for help in vain.A few days later at Cochise's funeral, Preach stands apart from the small service and afterward goes to the casket for a personal farewell. Toasting ""absent friends,"" Preach drinks from a wine bottle and recites a poem he has written for his friend. After promising Cochise that he and their friends will all be fine, Preach jogs away from the cemetery, confident in his future.At the end of the film, brief epilogues over still images of several characters reveal their fates:""Preach"" moved to Hollywood, California after graduation and found success as a writer.""Stone"" and ""Robert"" were killed two years later during a holdup.""Brenda"" became a librarian, got married, and currently lives in Atlanta with her husband and three children.""Damon"" joined the U.S. Army and is currently stationed in Europe.""Pooter"" became a factory worker and currently lives in in Muncie, Indiana.""Tyrone"" was killed during racial violence at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago."

After their discharge from jail, they travel by train to the village where the police officer lives with his widowed daughter-in-law.

Both agree to capture Gabbar Singh alive and hand him over to Baldev Singh. Things do not go as planned: Veeru falls for the local horse-carriage driver Basanti, and Jai starts to have romantic feelings for Baldev Singh's widowed daughter-in-law Radha. To make matters worse, Gabbar has sworn to kill both Jai and Veeru, and he holds Basanti hostage to lure them to him. But Jaidev and Veeru are so clever that no bandit can outwit the two.—gavin@sunny_deol2009@yahoo.com In order to avenge the brutal killings of his family members by notorious bandit Gabbar Singh, ex-police inspector Thakur Baldev Singh recruits two convicts, Veeru and Jaidev, and logged their stay in a small Indian village that is Gabbar's main target. When Gabbar learns that Jai and Veeru have come to kill him, he begins to kill all the residents of that village one by one. Now these two con-men and Thakur will be forced to quit their mission or continue risking innocent villages' lives.—gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com) Two convicts and small time crooks (Amitabh and Dharmendra) are picked by Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar), a former police officer, to seek vengeance on the dangerous bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) because he killed all of Thakur's family (except a daughter-in-law) and maimed Thakur for life.This was a result of an earlier incident in which Thakur -- acting as a police officer -- had captured Gabbar and helped in his conviction in the court. Gabbar managed to escape and wreaked havoc in Thakur's life. Now Thakur seeks the help of these two crooks to get Gabbar. The ensuing action makes for one of the most exciting Indian movies made to date.—Chetan Ahuja <Ahuja@student.msu.edu> The Thakur recruits Veeru and JaiFormer police chief Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) summons an old colleague and requests him to track down a pair of small-time thieves he once apprehended in the line of duty.
The two petty criminals, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan), are close pals who work together and share everything. They had encountered the Thakur in the past (as seen in a flashback), when after being caught by him trying to rob a train, he let them free temporarily to help him fight off bandits. The three succeeded in doing so, but as the Thakur lay unconscious after sustaining a wound, Veeru and Jai disputed over leaving him for dead and escaping (Veeru) or letting him live but facing jail themselves (Jai). The call was decided over a coin toss, which Jai won.
Recollecting that experience, the Thakur explains that Veeru and Jai would be the ideal men to help him end the tyranny of Gabbar Singh(Amjad Khan) - an infamous dacoit (bandit) wanted by the authorities for a Rs 50,000 reward. But money is not what the Thakur is after.
Veeru and Jai are found and brought to Ramgarh. They are told by the Thakur that they are to bring Gabbar to him alive for Rs 20,000 plus the Rs 50,000 reward.
After some difficulty in trusting each other, the Thakur demands Veeru and Jai's word and eventually Jai promises that they will do the job and he and Veeru decide to stay in Ramgarh to repel attacks from Gabbar's large gang.The tyranny of GabbarThree of Gabbar's enforcers arrive in Ramgarh to collect supplies from the defenceless villagers. This time, however, they go back empty-handed, due to Veeru and Jai's intervention. The villagers show their gratitude by hailing their new heroes.
In Gabbar's camp, the tyrant interrogates the three men he sent to Ramgarh about why they were defeated by only two men. His psychotic nature is shown when he subjects his men to a twisted version of Russian Roulette where all three survive against the odds. This event amuses Gabbar who begins to laugh uncontrollably at the bizarre occurrence and the unlikelyhood of it happening. His cackles get louder and louder, as his henchmen join in. The three men who have survived this ordeal are bemused but then relieved and slowly begin to laugh as well. As the sounds of all of Gabbar's army laughing like fools reverberate around the rocky camp, Gabbar suddenly stops laughing and uses the three remaining bullets to shoot the three men dead.
Gabbar's plan to attack Ramgarh on Holi is put into action and in a much tougher battle this time, Veeru and Jai meet their match and are held at gunpoint. With his two recruits facing death, the Thakur has a chance to throw a gun to Veeru. But instead of helping, he simply stands stationary. With quick thinking, Veeru and Jai manage to save their lives but at the end state their intentions to walk away from Ramgarh, leaving the villagers to defend themselves, due to the Thakur's cowardice.
But before they can, the Thakur tells them the real reason of why he wants Gabbar and why he couldnt help them.
Some time ago, the Thakur had caught Gabbar and had him imprisoned only for the dacoit to escape and plot an evil revenge against him. Gabbar made his way to the Thakur's home and cold-bloodedly, killed his two sons, daughter, daughter-in-law and his only grandson. The only person in the family to survive this massacre was the Thakur's younger daughter-in-law, Radha(Jaya Bachchan).
The Thakur tracked down Gabbar but this time, the tyrant held the upper hand thanks to his gang and tortured him. Gabbar reminded the Thakur of his promise to come back and haunt him once he escaped and this was the day. Grabbing two swords, Gabbar maniacally approached the Thakur and ruthlessly amputated both his arms, although the Thakur survives it. The Thakur had shrouded this disability from Veeru and Jai, but now it was clear why he could not physically help them.Village lifeLiving in Ramgarh, the cynical young Jai and lively Veeru find themselves growing fond of the villagers, taking pity on their sufferings under dacoit tyranny. Some of the villagers evoke more than fondness. Veeru is attracted to Basanti(Hema Malini), a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living driving a horse-cart. However, Basanti's aunt, who, thanks to Jai's meddling, is reluctant to let Veeru marry her niece and only after Veeru takes drastic measures does she finally agree.
Jai is drawn to Radha, the Thakur's reclusive widowed daughter-in-law, who very subtly returns his affections. The Thakur's servant, Ramlaal, tells of when Radha used to be full of life and colour until the day Gabbar killed her husband. After discussing it with Radha's father, the Thakur agrees that she can marry Jai.
The duo also befriend other villagers and instill a belief of freedom from Gabbar's villainous regime. Among these are the blind imam and his son, Ahmed, who has been offered a job in the city, but refuses to leave his father all alone. He is eventually talked into going and sets off on his horse. On the way, he has the bad luck of running into Gabbar's henchmen. Ahmed is killed and returned with a message for Ramgarh: Hand over Veeru and Jai or suffer the same fate as the dead boy.
As the villagers stand over Ahmed's body, they tell Veeru and Jai, that they can give away whatever wealth they have, but they cannot give away their children's lives. The Thakur, Veeru and Jai argue against ceding to Gabbar's threats, but only the imam, who has lost his son, convinces the villagers that they cannot simply give in to evil.The climaxVeeru and Jai fight back and send a message back to Gabbar: For every villager killed by Gabbar, Veeru and Jai will avenge them by killing four of his men in return. Gabbar, angered by this, swears death on Jai, Veeru, the Thakur, and all of Ramgarh.
The battle approaches its climax when Basanti and Veeru are captured and Jai follows. As Basanti is forced to dance by Gabbar to keep Veeru alive, Jai steadily gets through Gabbar's defences. Soon Jai is able to get into a position to shoot Gabbar and demands the release of his friends. Veeru and Basanti escape while Jai holds back the dacoits from a distance with a rifle. Once Veeru and Basanti are safe, Jai slowly draws back and heads for his friends, only to be wounded grievously by a bullet as he is running away.
Jai is reunited with Veeru and Basanti where they realise they are running out of ammunition. As Veeru is unaware of Jai's wound, Jai orders him to go back to the village where he can take Basanti and then return with ammo. Veeru does not want Jai to face the bandits alone, so he suggests that Jai should go. The two dispute once more and resort to what has been their only method of resolution over the years - the coin. As it was earlier in the film, Veeru loses the toss and goes back to the village.
Jai, slowly dying and with only a few bullets, manages to fend off advances by the bandits, who have hidden under a small bridge and have thrown a stick of dynamite that has failed to explode. Jai manages to get close enough to the dynamite and uses his last bullet to detonate it, taking out the bridge and most of Gabbar's men.
Veeru returns to find Jai dying and sadly talks with him before he dies in his arms. Some of the villagers rush to the scene, including Radha, who once again must endure the anguish of losing someone. As Veeru wipes a tear, he notices Jai's old coin in his hand and then it dawns on him that he had been tricked by Jai all along. The coin was double-headed and Jai had managed to manipulate every situation that they disagreed on to his favour. Angry at his friend for sacrificing his life to save him, Veeru becomes hell-bent on revenge and goes after Gabbar.
Veeru catches Gabbar and beats him up badly, about to finish him off. But before he can kill him, the Thakur appears and reminds him of the promise to bring Gabbar to him - alive. Veeru is ready to break his word to avenge Jai when he is told that it was Jai who made the promise. Unwilling to break Jai's promise, Veeru hands Gabbar over to the Thakur who reveals his spike-soled shoes, made to make Gabbar beg for a quick death.AftermathGabbar is kicked around by the Thakur but is saved in the nick of time by the police, who tell the Thakur that Gabbar must be arrested and dealt with by the law. As Gabbar is taken away, the Thakur is denied vengeance, but knows that Ramgarh is free once again.
Jai's funeral takes place as Veeru stands all alone in front of the pyre. In the distance, Radha watches on through a window.
With nothing more for him in Ramgarh, Veeru leaves on a train. But as he looks up, he sees that he is not alone. Basanti has also boarded the train and both she and Veeru leave Ramgarh together."

He then goes on a strange quest to find the castle and the beautiful woman who lives there. Pierre is haunted by a persistent dream in which he spends the night with a beautiful women in a white gown who lives in an ancient mansion, though she invariably awakes with no memory of him. He is convinced that his dream has some basis in his past, but his mother scoffs at the notion. One day, he sees a photograph in a perfume advertisement that looks just like the mansion he's seen in his dreams, and arranges to meet the woman who took the pictures at a movie theater. While he waits for her, he encounters the mysterious woman in white, and as he follows her, he discovers a strange coven of the living dead -- a band of beautiful women who need to drink human blood to survive. While attending a launch party for a new perfume, the photograph of a decrepit castle by the sea catches the eye of maternally-attached Frédéric. And as fragmented childhood memories of a pale-faced woman dressed in white start to haunt him, Frédéric decides to shed light on his opaque past and unravel the dark mystery of his family. But the cold, stone-walled mansion harbours spine-chilling secrets and an unbreakable spiritual bond bound by blood. Is Frédéric prepared to confront the shocking truth and the soft but treacherous lips of blood?—Nick Riganas Ever since his father died, Frederic [Jean-Loup Philippe] has been unable to remember
anything about his childhood, even though his mother has told him all
about it. One night, while at a party, Frederic notices a photograph of
some castle ruins near a beach. They look familiar to him, and he recalls
an incident that happened 20 years ago, when he was 12. He was lost. It
was getting dark, and he went to the castle where he was invited in by a
young girl [Annie Briand] dressed all in white. He spent the night there and became
infatuated with her. To thank her for her kindness, Frederic placed a toy
on her steps before he left to go home.When Frederic tells his mother [Natalie Perrey] about the memory, she denies that it
ever happened, so Frederic pays a visit to the photographer to find out
where the photo was taken. The photographer tells him that she's been paid
not to reveal the location but later relents and tells him to meet her at
midnight at the aquarium and she will tell him then. To kill time,
Frederic goes to the cinema. As he watches the movie, he notices the girl
in white standing in the doorway. He follows her outside. She leads him
into a cemetery and down into a crypt where he finds four coffins. He
opens one of the coffins to find several bats inside.Unknowingly, Frederic has released four vampiresses. Frederic runs
outside where he meets a woman who claims to be the girl he met 20 years
ago in the ruins, even though she looks nothing like her. She leads him to
a room in an old abandoned building. When he asks her to identify the toy
that he left with her 20 years ago, she cannot, confirming Frederic's
suspicion that she is working for the same people that paid the
photographer to keep quiet. For some reason, they do not want him to find
the girl. Suddenly, the woman bolts from the room, locking the door behind
her. While the girl in white watches, two of the vampiresses unlock the
door and release Frederic.It is now midnight, and Frederic goes to the aquarium where he finds
that the photographer has been murdered. A man with a briefcase walks
past, and Frederic follows him into the Metro. When the man pulls a gun on
him, Frederic kicks the gun from his hand, pulls the cord to stop the
train, and runs away. The man follows, cornering Frederic on a balcony.
Meanwhile, the two vampires throw a switch that turns on myriad fountains,
which afford Frederic with cover, and he is able to escape.Frederic tells his mother about seeing the girl in white. She tries
to convince him that he is mad and, while Frederic is changing clothes,
she calls the hospital. When Frederic leaves the house, he is immediately
captured by two ambulance drivers and taken to the hospital where he is
placed in a straitjacket and told that he is going to receive electroshock
therapy. While pacing in his room, Frederic sees the girl in white. He
begs her to speak to him if she truly exists, and she mouths the words ""Je
t'aime"". Then she disappears. Two nurses come to take Frederic to the
psychiatrist, but they turn out to be the two vampires. Instead, they
attack the psychiatrist, untie the straitjacket, and allow Frederick to
escape.While running down the street, Frederic sees a blind man selling
postcards of the ruins, so he buys one and learns that it is called
Sauveterre Castle. Certain that the girl in white is calling for his help,
Frederic catches the train to Sauveterre. It is just as he remembers it.
He even finds the toy that he left lying on the castle steps. He walks
through the castle looking for the girl. Eventually, he comes upon a room
where he finds books, dolls, toys, candles, a coffin, and a picture album
with his picture in it. Just as Frederic attempts to open the coffin, his
mother appears.She tells him the story of the girl in white. Her name is Jennifer,
and she's a vampire. Jennifer was imprisoned in Sauveterre Castle when she
was 16 in order to prevent the vampire curse from spreading. It was
Jennifer who killed Frederic's father. The corpses of the four vampires
freed by Frederic were moved to the abandoned vault in Paris. While three
men track down and stake the four vampires and build a bonfire to burn
their bodies, Frederic's mother sends him back into the castle with orders
to kill Jennifer and bring her head. But Frederic cannot do it and,
instead, brings the head of a statue which he tosses into the bonfire.After everyone leaves, Frederic returns to the castle and awakens
Jennifer. She tells him how she learned to project her sight and then her
spirit while she lay in her coffin waiting for Frederic to come. He allows
her to turn him into a vampire, and they both get into her coffin and let
the tide carry them out to sea. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

But the monster is surprised to find a cybernetic brain that fires back at him.Mugal returns and opens fire on Murakoshi. Murakoshi retaliates as Mugal uses Mafune as a human shield before escaping. Mortally wounded, Mafune cries out to his daughter with his dying breath. Embraced by Ichinose, Katsura's humanity is restored as she attempts to conceal her cybernetic nature. But Ichinose consoles her and she breaks into tears as Ichinose comforts her that she is still human. Katsura realizes that, since she is Mechagodzilla's controller, she must die to destroy the machine. Ichinose can't bring himself to kill her, causing Katsura to grab her gun and sacrifice herself.Mechagodzilla is disabled and finally destroyed by Godzilla, who turn his attention to Titanosaurus. Mugal attempts to flee from INTERPOL by boarding a flying saucer. As the saucers fly away, they are spotted by Godzilla and destroyed with a blast of atomic breath. He then finishes off Titanosaurus as the dinosaur plunges off a cliff into the ocean. Everybody celebrates as Godzilla emerges triumphant. But the victory is a somber one as Ichinose carries Katsura's body on a hill overlooking the sea. He is joined by Murakoshi and the other members of INTERPOL as they pay their respects to Katsura.

Fox can now have the life and things that he has always wanted. He begins a new relationship with Eugen, creates a business partnership, and his life is looking bright.

The next day, Fox wins 500,000 marks in the lottery, and Max's friends suddenly become Fox's friends, especially Eugen, the heir to a bookbinding firm that's short of cash. Eugen's polish beguiles Fox, and the fleecing begins.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>"

Before he leaves, the two plan a romantic trip to Rome, Italy.At the police precinct, Gaines and his partner, Sgt. Louis Belgrave (Paul Winfield), meet Marty and Paula Hollinger (Ben Johnson and Eileen Brennan), and ask Marty to view the deceased to see if it is his daughter, Gloria. Upon seeing Gloria's naked lifeless body, Marty punches Gaines in the face, screaming they should have covered her up. Sgt. Belgrave insists they charge Marty with assault, but Gaines apologizes for not covering the girl.Later, Gaines enters an interrogation room to find Belgrave and another police officer beating a confession out of an Albino man (David Estridge). Infuriated by their brutality, Gaines orders the prisoner released and given something to eat. Gaines then learns that Jerry Bellamy (David Spielberg), a murderer he arrested, was paroled after only serving five years of his two life sentences. Gaines goes to his office and stares wistfully at a seven-year old calendar showing the Roman coliseum.That night, Marty Hollinger lies in bed picturing his daughter, Gloria, as she grew from a toddler to teenager. His wife reminds him they ""lost"" Gloria a long time ago. Meanwhile, Gaines stands on his balcony overlooking Los Angeles, California, while Nicole has phone sex with a client. When Nicole hangs up, she complains her job is getting harder every day. Gaines suggests she quit, but is silent when she asks if he will take care of her. To lighten the mood, Nicole encourages him to reminisce about the love affair he had when he visited Rome.The next day, Belgrave and Gaines brief their boss, Capt. John Santoro (Ernest Borgnine), on the Gloria Hollinger case. Although the girl tested positive for semen, there was no sign of rape. Plus, blood tests indicate that Gloria died of suicide. After learning the girl's father is ""a nobody,"" Santoro tells them to close the file.Meanwhile, Nicole entertains mob attorney, ""Kingfish"" Leo Sellers (Eddie Albert), on his yacht. Sellers goes ashore to make a telephone call. In Akron, Ohio, his call is answered by a man at a telephone booth. Three men leave a union meeting hall, and are killed when the car explodes. Afterward, the man tells Sellers ""it is done"", and hangs up.Back in Los Angeles, Gaines removes a picture of Sellers and Gloria Hollinger from the dead girl's wallet. Sgt. Belgrave snatches it from him and gives it to another officer to enlarge it and make additional prints. The Hollingers arrive to collect their daughter's personal effects, and Marty refuses to accept his daughter's death was a suicide. When Gaines tells him the case is closed, Marty threatens to find the killer and take care of him. After Marty leaves, Paula explains he has never been the same after his traumatic experiences in the Korean War and a sympathetic Gaines gives her his business card in case she needs his help.Gaines learns that Jerry Bellamy has killed two women and taken a third hostage while holed up in a downtown factory. When Gaines arrives at the scene, Bellamy threatens to shoot his prisoner unless the police lieutenant comes in alone. Inside, Bellamy orders Gaines to kneel, then, as the killer rants about the evils of women, Belgrave drops from a skylight, distracting the killer. Gaines pulls his gun and kills Bellamy.Later, Gaines and Belgrave are drinking in Gaines's office, when Belgrave insists they investigate Leo Sellers's connection to Gloria's death. He argues that Seller is a mob lawyer, and Gloria was carrying an envelope holding $2,000 in cash and had Sellers's picture in her wallet. Knowing Seller is one of Nicole's clients, a reluctant Gaines agrees.Meanwhile, Marty collects Gloria's things from Gloria's roommate, Peggy Summers (Catherine Bach), who shows him a much larger photograph of Gloria and Sellers. Learning Gloria was a stripper who dated Herbie Dalitz, the emcee at her club, Marty goes to confront Herbie.That night, Gaines confesses he is having trouble accepting Nicole's profession. When he refuses to marry her, she packs to leave him. Gaines slaps her and she hits him in the head with an ashtray. He throws her on the bed, and what starts as a violent kiss turns passionate and they make love.The next morning, a narcotics officer gives Gaines a tape recording of Sellers calling Ohio and the bomb blast that killed the union men. He explains that the telephone booth was ""bugged"" to catch drug deals, but the tape now belongs to homicide. Later, Gaines and Belgrave respond to a telephone call from Paula Hollinger and go to her home where they find a badly beaten Marty. Marty says Gloria was at a sex party at a home owned by a man named Leo. Gaines agrees to investigate Gloria's death, but only if Marty promises not to take any more chances.Gaines interviews Herbie Dalitz, who admits procuring Gloria for Leo after he saw her in a pornographic movie. When questioned, Leo Sellers admits partying with Gloria, but insists she left his house alive. When Gaines asks if Leo feels any responsibility for the girl's suicide, Leo answers she was screwed up before he met her. Gaines then reveals that police taped his call to Ohio. Leo's only response is to say that he knows Nicole and Gaines are living together and admires that Gaines does not let her profession get in the way of their relationship.Later, Gaines has drinks with Paula Hollinger and learns that Gloria was the result of an affair she had while Marty was in a veteran's hospital being treated for mental illness. Although Marty learned of the affair, he never suspected he was not Gloria's father. The next day, Gaines tells Marty that Gloria committed suicide. When Marty accuses Gaines of being paid off, the lieutenant shows him film of Gloria and Peggy Summers having sex with a man. Marty leaves in tears, goes to Peggy and beats her until she reveals Leo's last name. When he leaves, Peggy calls Belgrave.Carrying a loaded gun, Marty confronts Sellers at his house. Sellers ask why kill him, as there ""were a lot of men who led Gloria astray?"" Marty replies that he cannot kill everyone and shoots him between the eyes. Gaines and Belgrave arrive to find Leo dead and Marty slumped in a chair. Gaines tries to get Marty to understand the trouble he is, but Marty just repeats that he will have his day in court. After learning Marty bought the gun from a pawnshop without giving his name, Gaines takes the pistol and shoots Marty in the shoulder, then concocts a story that Sellers pulled the gun when Marty confronted him and, in the ensuing struggle, Marty was wounded and Leo killed. Belgrave protests, but Gaines explains that even though Leo did not kill Gloria, he was a murderer and there are times justice is served by ""sticking up for the Marty's of the world.""Gaines telephones Nicole and tells her to meet him at the airport so they can fly to Sausalito, California, and get married. After hanging up, Gaines walks into a liquor store, where an armed man attempts to rob the place. Gaines intercedes, but he is shot dead. Later, Belgrave finds Nicole at the airport and breaks the news. As they leave, an airplane headed for Rome takes off."
The Man from Hong Kong,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073343/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"While on dispatch in Australia to extradite a drug courier, a tough Hong Kong cop wages a one-man war against Sydney's most powerful kingpin. Australian authorities arrest a man believed to be connected to the Sydney criminal underworld and send for Inspector Fang Sing Leng from Hong Kong to question him. After the alleged criminal is assassinated, Inspector Leng and the Sydney police try to hunt down those responsible and hope to solve their case along the way.

Due to Chan's refusal to cooperate and inability to speak English, the Royal Hong Kong Police Force assigns one of its Special Branch's finest officers, Inspector Fang Sing Leng (Jimmy Wang Yu) - who is not only a polyglot but also a deadly master of kung fu and sharpshooting - to assist Taylor and his slovenly partner, Morrie Grosse (Hugh Keays-Byrne), in extraditing Chan and identifying his Australian contact. Before leaving for Sydney, Fang meets cute with hang-gliding journalist Caroline Thorne (Rosalind Speirs) after she unwittingly lands at the RHKPF's base at Wong Chuk Hang.Upon arriving down under and ""interrogating"" Chan, Fang learns that his Australian boss is Jack Wilton (George Lazenby), an import/export businessman whose varied portfolio - including the operation of a martial arts school - is merely a smokescreen for his criminal activities, effectively making him Sydney's most powerful man.

Bullet Train,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080479/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Criminals plant a bomb on a high-speed train. It will explode when the train slows down, unless a ransom is paid. One of the Japanese Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" is threatened with a bomb that will explode automatically if the train slows below 80 km/h, unless a ransom is paid. Police race to find the bombers and to learn how to defuse the bomb.—Anonymous A former businessman who lost his manufacturing company to bankruptcy and separated from his wife and son a year earlier is desperate to make ends meet and start over. He collaborates with an activist and a former employee in an elaborate plot to extort money from the government. He threatens that one of Japan's Bullet Trains will explode if it drops below 80km/h unless his ransom is paid. It's a race against time for both the passengers and police to find and defuse the bomb before an imminent catastrophe unfolds.—DanTheMan2150AD Tetsuo Okita is a former businessman who lost his manufacturing company to bankruptcy and separated from his wife and son a year earlier. Desperate to make ends meet and start over, he collaborates with activist Masaru Koga and his former employee Hiroshi Oshiro in an elaborate plot to extort money from the government.Hikari 109 is a high-speed 0 series bullet train carrying 1,500 passengers from Tokyo to Hakata. Shortly after the train's departure, railway security head Miyashita is notified by Okita that a bomb has been planted aboard and will explode if the train slows down below 80 km/h. As proof of the bomb's efficiency, Okita tells Miyashita that a similar bomb has been placed on freight train 5790 bound from Yubari to Oiwake. When freight train 5790 indeed explodes, Hikari 109's conductor Aoki is informed by Shinkansen director Kuramochi not to slow down the train below 120 km/h while the security personnel aboard the train search for the bomb - thus delaying the trip to Hakata by three hours. Police officials back in Tokyo are tasked to either find the bomber or the bomb first.Back aboard Hikari 109, passengers start becoming weary and demand the train stop when security does a second search. For the duration of the journey, Kuramochi must coordinate with Aoki on timing the train's speed and position to avoid incoming traffic while keeping it safe from the speed-sensitive detonator. Okita calls the National Railway authorities again; this time, he demands US$5 million in an aluminium suitcase in exchange for the safety of Hikari 109's passengers. As the Prime Minister prepares the ransom, police find their first lead when a cigarette pack containing fingerprints of Koga are found at Yubari station prior to freight train 5790's departure.Meanwhile, passengers aboard Hikari 109 start to panic when the train passes through Nagoya, with a pregnant passenger named Kazuko Hirao going into labour. As a means of settling down the passengers, co-engineer Kikuchi tells them of the bomb on board. National Railway officials are in further disdain when they realize that the bomb is attached to one of the train's wheels. Okita once more calls the officials and tells them to send the money northbound via helicopter and land at Yorii High School. Officer Senda, who carries the suitcase, is then instructed to cross the Arakawa River; upon reaching Iwate, the suitcase is roped and pulled up a cliff by Oshiro. However, Oshiro is forced to drop the case and retreat when police yell at a university judo team jogging nearby. Fleeing via motorcycle, Oshiro finds himself tailed by several squad cars until he collides with one and is killed after hitting a light post.The passengers once again panic when a businessman threatens to pull the emergency door latch open as the train passes through Shin-Osaka; they are further exacerbated when they hear of Oshiro's death on the radio. Meanwhile, police locate Koga, but fail to arrest him, despite wounding him during the chase. Koga limps back into Okita's hideout to have his gunshot wound tended. Okita ponders on giving up his mission, as he has failed to prevent any bloodshed, but Koga convinces him to carry on. As the police trace the bomb parts to Okita's former company in Shimura, Okita makes another phone call and tells Miyashita to drop the money at an abandoned truck by the Kanda motorway in 10 minutes. After the police do as instructed, Okita takes the suitcase and makes his getaway. Back aboard the train, Kazuko loses her baby in a miscarriage and is in need of a blood transfusion. Okita then calls Miyashita and tells him to pick up a diagram of the bomb at Sun Plaza cafe in Shinbashi. Unfortunately, the cafe is destroyed by fire by the time police arrive. When the police surround Okita's hideout, Koga blows himself up with a stick of dynamite rather than turn himself in.With no other options left, Kuramochi goes on television to make an appeal for Okita to help them disable the bomb. On the train, Shinji Fujio, a former accomplice of Okita being escorted after his arrest, reveals that Okita is on his way out of Japan using a false name. With the help of high-speed cameras, the Shinkansen authorities manage to locate the bomb underneath the second coach. Kuramochi relays the information to Aoki and sends a rescue train to provide welding equipment to cut an access hole where the bomb is. Aoki succeeds in defusing the bomb, but the authorities suspect a second bomb is located elsewhere underneath the train. Despite this, the government gives the order to stop the train. Aoki manages to stop Hikari 109 without incident. As Kuramochi leaves the main control room to regain his composure, he discovers that his appeal is still being broadcast on TV. Miyashita explains that this is part of the police's trap for Okita. Overwhelmed by the pressure of the day's situation, Kuramochi resigns from his position.Meanwhile, at Haneda Airport, Okita prepares to board his flight, but his cover is blown when his ex-wife Yasuko Tomita and son Kenichi spot him. He is shot dead while attempting to escape outside the airport."

Detective Bo Lockley is instructed to try to find her, not knowing she's also a cop. Police procedural drama set in New York City during the 1970s. Rookie cop Beauregard Bo Lockley is assigned to the 16th detective squad in the New York Police Department. He is honest, humane, thoughtful and a bit inexperienced. Being college-educated and long-haired he could pass for a hippie or an anti-Vietnam War activist. His candid demeanor and revolutionary and innovative ideas about what police work should be like amuse his colleagues. His new partner, veteran detective Richard Crunch Blackstone even makes fun about Lockley's first name. He privately reveals to other detectives that he doesn't think Lockley will last in the detective career as he isn't armed with the skills necessary to survive the violent, crime-ridden, dog-eat-dog world of New York City. Nevertheless, detective Blackstone accepts the task to train the rookie. Ironically, they both have things they could learn from one another as they have different approaches to solving problems. At the same time, their squad is after a notorious drug dealer and illegal weapons trafficker named Thomas 'Stick' Henderson. This case is assigned to a skilled undercover female detective named Patty Butler. She plans to ingratiate herself with Henderson in the hope that he will court her, become her lover and entrust her with his secrets concerning his criminal activities. Her suggestion is met with reluctance by her superiors who fear that she could get killed and make the department look bad. Not to mention the fact they could lose their jobs or pensions. However, detective Patty Butler persuades them to give her permission for her plan. They agree, but they warn her not to fall in love with him for real. Promising to be professional, Patty Butler gets to work. The real tragedy occurs when rookie Beauregard Lockley notices Patty Butler on the streets and is attracted to her without knowing who she is. No one from the squad informs Lockley that Patty Butler is a cop, for fear of blowing her cover. But Lockley often thinks about her. When Patty fails to contact her superiors and disappears for more than two weeks, the squad superiors send rookie Lockley to look for her without telling him who she is. They only tell him that the girl is a person of interest to the police and that her nickname is 'Chicklet'. When Lockley finds her, he realizes that she is the attractive girl he has previously seen on the streets while training with his veteran partner. Lockley is determined to save 'Chicklet' from her criminal boyfriend, still not knowing that she's an undercover cop on assignment. Lockley follows her, talks to her and tries to take her away with him. However, Patty Butler aka 'Chicklet' is determined to finish her undercover assignment. She refuses to go with Lockley or to reveal to him her real identity. She only promises to secretly meet him the next day in a pub. Lockley informs his superiors he found 'Chicklet' but they tell him to forget all about her. Unfazed, detective Lockley goes to her 'boyfriend's' apartment in Times Square and that's where the first tragedy strikes. Furthermore, a chase on foot ensues and a Mexican stand-off in an elevator of the Saks Fifth Avenue department store occurs. That's the second tragedy. An Internal Affairs - DA Office investigation follows and a third tragedy brings everything to a conclusion.—nufs68 Patty Butler (Susan Blakely), is a very comely young police officer who is pretending to be a runaway girl with the nickname of ""Chicklet,"" and has been given permission by the department to be the live-in girlfriend of Thomas 'Stick' Henderson (Tony King), a suspected drug dealer, so that the police can gather evidence against him. To back up her cover story, Detective Bo Lockley (Michael Moriarty) has been given what should be an almost impossible assignment: without being told she is actually an undercover police officer, he is instructed to spend a few weeks trying to find Chicklet. Bo openly looking for and trying to find her will convince Stick that his girlfriend really is a runaway.Amazingly, Bo is actually an excellent detective and finds her in the sleazy underbelly of the city. Bo is then thanked by his supervisor, Richard 'Crunch' Blackstone (Yaphet Kotto) and told to go back to his previous assignment. Either infatuated with Chicklet or not able to just allow her to be abandoned by the system, he goes to Stick's loft to try and rescue her. In the process, Bo and Stick become engaged in a firefight, whereupon Stick is able to escape the apartment, and Bo ends up chasing Stick, running across town barefoot, carrying a handgun and dressed only in boxer shorts, into a department store, and are trapped in a Mexican standoff in one of the department store elevators.Eventually the police barricade the elevator, and Crunch grabs him when Bo and Stick leave through the elevator's emergency exit ceiling panel. Bo having been pulled to safety, the police then open fire on Stick, killing him.In the aftermath of the firefight and the subsequent killing of Stick, it is discovered that Officer Butler was killed in Stick's loft by Bo, and an investigation has to be made as to whether he was negligent. As a result of the investigation, it's determined that she was killed as a result of Bo trying to defend himself from Stick shooting at him, and thus the shooting was accidental. Bo, however, was so depressed by what he had done that he hung himself in his jail cell before he finds out that it was an accident.The movie is, in effect, a police report of an incident where a police officer was shot by another officer who later committed suicide in jail, and a suspected perpetrator being killed in a public place (the department store), being made to the Police Commissioner, which is where the title of the film came from."

Lewis and Clark were famous comedians during the vaudeville era. Off-stage, though, they couldn't stand each other, and haven't spoken in over twenty years. Ben, Willy Clark's nephew, is the producer of a variety show that wants to feature a reunion of the classic duo. How will Ben convince the crotchety old comedians to put aside their differences before the big show?—Mike Konczewski Al Lewis and Willy Clark were once a popular vaudeville comedy team called Lewis and Clark, also known as The Sunshine Boys. After forty-three years as a team, they parted company over eleven years prior on not too friendly terms, as Willy wanted to continue his career, whereas Al wanted to retire. They have not spoken since. Willy's nephew, Ben, a talent agent, has been trying to find acting jobs for his uncle since with little success, as Willy's age and declining ability is showing. But a lucrative opportunity comes up when one of the major networks is producing and airing a special on the history of comedy, and want The Sunshine Boys to appear. Ben has to try and convince the comedy team to reunite for just this one gig. Ben has to try and manage the individual quirks and personalities of each of The Sunshine Boys while putting on a good face to the network that there is harmony within The Sunshine Boys comedy team. Ben also has to manage the lives of two men in the twilight of their lives.—Huggo Former vaudeville and burlesque comic Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) is late for a television commercial audition and his agent and nephew, Ben Clark (Richard Benjamin), frets as he attempts to keep his uncle's try-out from being canceled. When he finally arrives, Ben pleads with the ad agency director to see Willy; but the cantankerous old performer is so unfocused and disagreeable that he ruins any chance he might have had to land the job.Later, at Willy's apartment, Ben gets blamed for being unable to find work for his uncle. However, Ben tells Willy of an offer to do a spot on a upcoming TV special about the history of comedy. The network wants Willy to re-team with his former stage partner Al Lewis (George Burns) and perform their trademark ""Doctor Routine."" Willy refuses, claiming he feels betrayed by Lewis, who decided to retire. It is revealed here by Willy that he and Al were once a popular vaudeville comedy act known as ""Lewis and Clark"" and also called the Sunshine Boys. After 43 years together, they parted ways 11 years ago on unfriendly terms and have not spoken to each other since then. The break-up was due, in part, to Al's intent to retire and Willy's desire to continue performing.After delicate negotiations in which Ben visits Al in the New Jersey suburbs, where he now lives with his daughter's family, he persuades Willy to meet Al at his New York City apartment, discuss their differences, and rehearse the routine. After Ben leaves, Al enters and meets Willy for the first time in 11 years. The meeting is a disaster, and Al annoys Willy with his old habits. An attempt to rehearse the Doctor Sketch starts with the two grudgingly getting re-acquainted, but goes only as far as Al entering the doctor's (Willy's) office, before Willy decides to change the scripted long-established ""Come in"" to ""Enter!"" This results in a loud shouting argument and Al's stormy departure.Ben eventually negotiates a detente so the former partners will not have to speak with each other: simply show up for one technical rehearsal on the day of taping and then do the show. Ben tries to salvage the situation, despite the objections of Al's daughter to her father being bothered any more about the special and manages to get them in the studio. In the dressing room, Al and Willy do not speak to each other as persons, just like they did in the last year they did their sketches. There is unpleasantness when Willy carelessly dumps makeup jars on Al, followed by Willy's usual trouble with doors, in the dressing room.After Phyllis Diller finishes her scene and Steve Allen speaks his introduction, the Doctor Sketch starts. The technical rehearsal goes no better than the earlier confrontation in Willy's apartment. It flows smoothly until Willy starts shouting about Al's spitting on him and poking him in the chest. Despite Ben and the staff trying to restore order, Willy finally storms off the set, shouting accusations and abuse, and Al also leaves (finding it impossible to work with the man). In the stairwell, Willy's ongoing temper tantrum results in him being felled by a serious heart attack.Even though Willy is allowed no visitors, Al comes to the hospital to stand vigil. Later, Willy is discharged from the hospital and recovers at his apartment with the assistance of a private nurse that Ben hires. Willy constantly argues and verbally squabbles with the nurse.With the now-frail Willy no longer able to look after himself in his New York apartment, Ben and his wife visit the Actors Fund Home in New Jersey and arrange for Willy to move there. When Ben comes to tell Willy about the plan, Willy finally lets down his guard enough to express his fear that Ben will no longer make his regular Wednesday visits when he is all the way out in New Jersey. Ben assures his uncle that he will still come by, and that Willy will be surrounded by friends and be able to participate with his fellow show business retirees in putting on shows for the residents.

Walking Tall Part II,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073880/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Sheriff Buford Pusser continues his one-man war against moonshiners and a ruthless crime syndicate after the murder of his wife in late-1960s Tennessee. Part 2 opens with Buford Pusser's two main deputies, Obra Eaker (Robert DoQui) and Grady Coker (Bruce Glover), as well as Buford's father and some of the town's citizens all wondering if Buford will seek re-election. Obra and Grady both state that there is no way Buford resigns until he either convicts or kills everyone who was involved in the ambush that led to his wife Pauline's death (in the previous movie).Buford's mother (Lurene Tuttle) and his children visit Buford who is still in the hospital recovering from plastic surgery that was needed to restore his face. Buford's mother asks him about re-election and confesses that she wishes he would retire. ""There ain't no shame in quitting, Buford,"" she tells him. To which he replies, ""I know , Mama.""Buford (now played by Bo Svenson) is re-elected and his first order of business is to bust up a still operating on the banks of the river. Buford and his deputies surprise the moonshiners and round them all up, except for the leader Pinky Dobson (Luke Askew) who gets away in a speedboat.Dobson then goes to the mansion of local mob boss John Witter (Logan Ramsey), a corrupt state official (seen briefly in the previous film). Witter is angry when Dobson brings Boston-based hit-man Ray Henry (John Davis Chandler) to the meeting. Witter makes Ray Henry wait in another room while he and Dobson privately talk about what to do about Buford. Witter grumbles about how Buford has cost him a lot of money by shutting down his prostitution and gambling operations. He puts pressure on Dobson to take Buford out. Dobson promises he will.Dobson goes to a car racetrack to talk to a driver named Stud Pardee (Richard Jaeckel) about helping him to get rid of Buford. Pardee strips two of Buford's lug bolts on his Impala and then entices Buford into a high-speed car chase. Buford's wheel does come off during the chase but he survives unhurt. Meanwhile, the only participant in the ambush that Buford recognized from police photos turns up with a bullet in his head.Witter brings in a beautiful woman named Marganne Stilson (Angel Tompkins) to win Buford's confidence and eventually kill him. ""Take a week,"" he tells Stilson. ""Take two weeks. Just don't press to hard or he'll be on to you. This man is no dummy.""An investigation reveals that the only blue and white Camaro in the county that Buford chased is owned by Stud Pardee. Buford gets a warrant, tracks down Pardee and proceeds to destroy his prized car while looking for contraband. After tearing apart the door panels, having Obra cut open his tires which costs $300 a piece and knocking out all the windows, Buford finds a pint of whiskey under Pardee's seat. Buford offers Pardee a drink. Pardees declines. Buford tells him, ""You look like you could use a drink."" Pardee takes the bottle and tries to drink it all down. Buford stops him, telling him, ""I need the rest of this for evidence."" Pardee tells Buford, ""You know you have a hell of a lot of enemies around here."" Buford informs Pardee that his car is impounded and will be sold at an auction.Next, Buford busts up a still operation that uses the Falcon Baptist Church as a cover. One of the moonshiners takes off running when accosted by Buford and his squad. Buford chases the man through the woods eventually catching him. The man asks Buford why he is has time to bother ""us poor blacks"" Buford tells him, ""Same as everyone else."" To which the man replies, ""Same as that big horse ranch on the hill?"" He says Buford looks the other way because A.C. Hand (Archie Grinalds) is a friend of his father's. Buford tells Obra to swear out a warrant for A.C. Hand because ""I don't want there to be any misunderstanding from anyone.""Buford raids Hand's place and tells him he's going to be facing time in the penitentiary. Buford's father (Noah Beery, Jr.) is understandably upset. A.C. Hand is his oldest and dearest friend ""since before I ever even went to school."" Buford reminds his father that he is after the man at the top because he ""destroyed my family.""While Obra is in the middle of telling Buford that his uncle spotted a ""new cooking operation down on the Hatchie River,"" Marganne Stilson, posing as a graduate student from Ole Miss, tries to get Buford to show her around. Buford declines because he is in the middle of something important. Stilson says she will hold Buford to his promise to show her around at a later date.Meanwhile, Witter himself makes advances at Stilson but she quickly informs him that he cannot afford her.Buford is informed that the fancy speed-boat has been spotted again, coming into McNairy County. Buford sets up a ""sting"" operation, but as he is leaving his house he discovers a bomb planted under his hood by Ray Henry. Buford radios Obra and Grady to tell that that he has a ""little mechanical problem."" He reminds them that it is ""the man in the boat that you are after."" Grady inadvertently trips an alarm wire while the deputies are moving in on the still and Pinky Dobson again escapes in his speed-boat.Buford had made a secret deal with a local car dealer named Floyd Tate to get a new undercover police car every four to six weeks. Tate calls one day to tell Buford his new car is ready. Buford lets Obra talk him into going to exchange the cars for him. Since it's his day off, Obra explained, it wouldn't cost the county anything. Buford is hesitant at first, but Obra finally convinces him. Obra is driving 100 mph in Buford's car when he discovers the brakes are out, and the steering has been tampered with. Obra dies in a head-on collision. At the funeral, Buford tells Obra's parents that Obra died in his place because his car had been tampered with.Buford makes a deal with Sheriff Tanner (Red West) in Alcorn County, Mississippi to finally nail Pardee. Buford offers to show Stilson around. They get in Buford's car. Stilson claims to have left a map with all the places she is interested in seeing in the cottage she has rented by the lake. Buford says no problem and offers to take her there. Two snipers are waiting for him in a boat. Stilson suggests a picnic. Buford says it may be a little chilly for a picnic. Buford and Stilson go inside her cottage where Buford informs her that there is no student registered at Ole Miss named Stilson. He makes her go back outside with him and frightens off the snipers before telling Stilson to let Dobson know that he is wise to their plans.Sheriff Tanner pursues Pardee back across the state line. Buford takes up the chase. Pardee is driving his new Corvette convertible. Pardee manages to go around a road-block set up by the deputies but later crashes and his trapped in his overturned car. Buford gets Pardee to confess that it was Pinky Dobson who hired him. Buford helps free Pardee before his car explodes. Dobson once again escapes in his boat when his distillery is raided. This time, however, they are ready for him. Mr. Pusser has supervised a blockade of logs strung across the river. Buford tells Dobson to surrender. Dobson ignores him and ultimately is up-ended when he hits the barricade and he gets arrested.Ray Henry purchases a machine gun and 1,000 rounds of ammo. Buford learns from an FBI agent that Ray Henry was Dobson's cell-mate for three-and-a-half years and that they were both seen in the vicinity the night Buford and his wife were ambushed. Dobson is in the hospital but escapes with the help of his girlfriend, Ruby Ann (Brooke Mills). Buford and an FBI agent pursue Dobson and Ruby Ann in an off-road car chase. Buford shoots and kills Dobson. Ruby Ann tells Buford where Ray Henry is and when Dobson tells her to shut up, she says she is not afraid of Witter like Dobson and Ray Henry both are.Buford and his men go to the boarding-house where Ray Henry is living. Buford is wounded but finally kills Ray Henry. As he is getting into an ambulance, Buford asks Grady if he remembers a man from Nashville shaking his hand right after he was elected sheriff. Grady asks, ""What man?"" Buford answers ""A fat man, named Witter. I almost forgot about him""...... which sets the stage up for Walking Tall: The Final Chapter."

Altaville is a tiny, snow-covered settlement populated entirely by men, ranging from outlaws to social outcasts. After initial resentment to these outsiders in their community, the men of Altaville become excited at the prospect of a birth in their settlement, and betting commences on the gender of the baby. Celebrations break out at the sound of the baby's cries and learning that it's a boy, but once again tragedy strikes as Bunny goes into seizures and dies from internal bleeding.

Mitchell,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073396/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A tough, slobby, honest cop tries to simultaneously take down heroin dealers and a corrupt businessman who murdered a burglar, even if it costs him his life. Joe Don Bakeris Mitchell, a principled, hard-nosed, big-bellied cop with an affinity for porn and Schlitz. His latest assignment: taking down a crime boss, drug smugglers and a corrupt businessman while also keeping his own high class prostitute girlfriend in line.—<jigen@yahoo.com> The movie opens with title and credits and the Mitchell theme over stills of Mitchell (we will see this was the death of one of the Dune Buggy drivers later in the movie). It is late evening at the Walter Deaney lavish residence. No one is home and a burglar (John Ashby) breaks in through the French door to the study. Enroute home in his limo is Walter Deaney (John Saxon) and friends: two hookers and a public official are heading back to the house to continue the party. The burglar steals some silverware and looks over the gun case as the limo pulls onto the long driveway to the house. The blonde, Helena Jackman (Vicky Peters) and brunette, Prudence Lang (Carole Estes) hookers are left in the living room while Deaney and Don Townsend (Bill Sullivan) go to get something in another room. Deaney spots a light and hears the burglar in the study. Rather than call the police as Don suggests, he decides to take matters into his own hands. He sets a trap and gets a gun from a hallway drawer. When the burglar comes into the hallway to investigate, Deaney shoots him in the chest, killing him.A patrol car, carrying Mitchell (Joe Don Baker) in the backseat, responds to a police call at the Deaney residence. When they arrive, a private security patrol walks over to greet them. Mitchell joins the two patrolmen in the investigation. Deaney explains to the patrolman what happened. We see a firearm next to the body of the burglar. Mitchell picks up the hand gun with a pencil and places it in a plastic evidence bag. He asks Deaney if all the guns in the case are loaded. He pulls one from high in the case and check it and notices that Don and the two hookers are leaving. Mitchell activates the gate and closes it before the car can leave the property. He trots out to the limo while Deaney makes a phone call. The crime lab has arrived and tapes off the body and photographs the scene. Mitchell resumes his examination of the gun case contents.It is Christmas time and Police Chief Albert Pallin (Robert Phillips) enters the station. Mitchell is waiting for him in his office. The two men don't like each other. Mitchell has refused to sign the report on the death at the Deaney residence. Mitchell suspects Deaney is lying and that the death of the burglar was murder. Pallin warns Mitchell not to bother Deaney and to see Det. Aldridge (Buck Young) for his next assignment. Mitchell must watch one James Arthur Cummings (Martin Balsam) on a 24-hour surveillance. Det. Tyzack (Rayford Barnes) takes Mitchell to the Cummings residence and briefs him. He tells Mitchell that Cummings specializes in the import of stolen merchandise, and this week it is Heroin from Mexico: a full kilo. Mitchell vows to get both Deaney and Cummings, but Tyzack disagrees, ""No way, you don't get neither."" Mitchell gets in his car and waits for Cummings to come home. He doesn't have long to wait. Benton (Merlin Olsen) is Cummings' bodyguard and driver and pulls up and opens the car door for his boss. Mitchell trots up the driveway and introduces himself. Cummings dismisses the cop telling him, ""Benefit's not due until January, son. Make an appointment, son, and have your chief give me a ring."" Benton tartly adds, ""No salesmen at this entrance."" Mitchell walks back to his car to begin a long day. He lights up a cigarette. He empties out the ashtray as Benton watches from the house. Cummings approaches the driver's open window and asks, ""All right. Now what do you want?"" Mitchell asks about Mistretta and the Heroin shipment from Mexico. Cummings denies any knowledge and warns Mitchell about falling rocks. At midnight Mitchell drives to the Deaney home and Cummings calls Mistretta. A short time later Salvatore Mistretta (Morgan Paull) picks Cummings up at his home. They drive and talk. Cummings wants the dope shipped somewhere else. Mr. Gallano apparently approved of both the shipment and using Cummings' facilities without informing Cummings. Mitchell calls in to report he is at the Deaney residence and he is going inside unarmed. He makes entry the same as the burglar and notes he couldn't reach the handguns, if like the burglar, he was only 5'4"" tall. Deaney is home and catches sight of the detective. A car headlight reveals Deaney and Mitchell runs back to his car. Mitchell returns to headquarters and he and Tyzack are going through the file room. Chief Pallin enters the room and orders Tyzack out. Pallin explains the Feds have been investigating Deaney and his trade union activities, so leave him alone. Mitchell returns home and is reviewing the Cummings file when someone comes to the door. It is Greta (Linda Evans), a very high priced hooker. She introduces herself as Mitchell's ""new friend"". He invites her in and offers her a drink. He manages to spill a beer on her legs. She explains that she is a Christmas present, but she won't tell Mitchell who is paying. Mitchell empties her purse and finds nothing but her ID. She leaves.The next day, Mitchell follows Cummings to the park. Cummings meets with Tony Gallano (Harold J. Stone) and again makes it clear he will not participate in the Heroin shipment. The short meeting ends and Mitchell follows Cummings car. Cummings stops and gets out to talk to Mitchell. He makes it clear he does not want to be bothered by the policeman. Assuming Mitchell would say no, Cummings and Benton arrange for a reception on a dirt road. An orange Mustang, driven by Benton's friend (Alan Gibbs) runs Mitchell off the road destroying Mitchell's car. Mitchell does manage to get the license number. He intends to deal with this person on his own terms.Cummings calls his friend Rudy Moran (Sidney Clute) in Las Vegas. He explains the situation, hoping for a little assistance, but Rudy tells Cummings, ""What the hell are you calling me for? If Gallano's involved, I don't want any part of it."" Mitchell picks up a new car and sees Cummings parked near the station. He drives up and parks next to a yellow Plymouth with three men inside. Mitchell gets out and walks over to the deli where Cummings is buying some food. He steps on Benton's foot on the way. As Cummings gets back into his car, the yellow Plymouth drives by and snaps the back door off the Lincoln. Mitchell walks back to his car and gets a call on the details about the Mustang driver. Mitchell drives over to the address and waits. He spots the driver pulling the battered orange car into the garage. Mitchell pulls up and gets out of his car. Before the man can retrieve a weapon from the passenger's side of the Mustang, Mitchell grabs him, hits him twice, and then kicks the door shut on the guy's hand. The man screams in pain, and Mitchell tells him, ""Shut up, you'll wake up the neighbors."" He takes the man's gun and leaves.Mitchell is at his desk at the station reviewing pictures of the Cummings case. Aldridge demands Mitchell bring in at least one man tailing Cummings. Cummings is out playing golf, Benton is acting as caddy. Mitchell watches from his car. A man from the yellow Plymouth gets out and approaches Cummings. Mitchell gets out of his car to observe. He talks to the man and is brushed off. Edmondo Bocca (Duffy Hambleton) runs towards Cummings, so Mitchell shoots him in the leg. He disarms the bleeding hood and hands the man's gun to Cummings. He tells Cummings, ""I've got to go call headquarters."" The two men in the yellow Plymouth observe the scene and then drive off. Aldridge confronts Mitchell outside the police station. Mitchell reminds Aldridge he wanted the man for two weeks and no bail and got it.Mitchell joins Cummings at his home for dinner. Benton acts as cook and butler. Cummings tries to impart some advice, but Mitchell asks about the Heroin. Cummings does volunteer that Bocca works for Mistretta. Cummings and Brenton get into an argument over the cold coffee. Mitchell drives home and gets beaten up by the two men in the Plymouth working for Mistretta. A night with Greta helps. Mitchell again asks Greta who is paying her and she refuses to answer. Mitchell tells her that he just wants to know who is paying her. She responds, ""So why does that bother you, you're not paying for it...You couldn't afford me...$1,000 a night."" Greta makes coffee and Mitchell again goes through her purse. He finds marijuana and he arrests her after she accuses him of being a crooked cop. He hands over the bag of grass to the Desk Sergeant (Jerry Hardin) and waits for her booking. Mitchell tells Greta, ""It's only a $500 fine. At a $1000 per night, you're still ahead."" ""Oh, you're a mean bastard, Mitchell,"" she tartly replies. ""I had a clean record in this town."" Mitchell proudly confirms for the Desk Sergeant that he enjoyed her company, and then leaves the building.The next day, Mitchell is still on surveillance. Greta is parked behind him. Cummings tells Benton to invite Mitchell into the house. Cummings comes to the point, ""I want to put you on the payroll."" He concedes he needs help, ""I want to buy your services."" While Mitchell takes notes of the bribe, Greta bangs into Mitchell's car. She writes ""Bastard"" on the windshield with her lipstick. Cummings continues, ""It could be open, cash, or subtle just like you take it from other people."" On the subject of the hooker, Cummings notes, ""She's too expensive, you can't afford her on a policeman's salary. Now someone's picking up the check, who could that be?"" Mitchell tells Cummings it is him, but Cummings corrects the detective, ""No, I don't. I don't pay for your whores, Mitchell."" Mitchell asks, ""Then who is?"" Cummings laughs and responds, ""You mean you don't know? You're a cop, and you don't know?"" Mitchell storms out of the house and drives over to see Deaney. ""I knew you'd call sooner or later,"" Deaney tells Mitchell. Deaney admits he admires Mitchell and adds, ""How's the broad?"" He offers to set up a company and transfer property with a $75,000 profit for Mitchell. Mitchell responds, ""I'm gonna bust you for the murder of the Mexican, or die trying."" Deaney warns Mitchell that that would be a big mistake.At the Indian Dunes Motor Recreation Park, Mitchell follows Cummings into the lot. Deaney is driving a Dune Buggy and talks to Cummings and suggest murder as a solution to their mutual problem. The limo departs and Mitchell follows. Cummings gets out of his car and sits in Mitchell's car. He offers Mitchell Walter Deaney, but Mitchell counteroffers that he will get Cummings first, and then he'll get Deaney on his own. Benton pulls a gun and takes Mitchell's gun. Cummings and Benton drive off. Cummings explains to Benton that if Deaney kills Mitchell, then Cummings will have more cops protecting him from Mistretta. They drive to the track and Mitchell gets stuck in the mud. He gets out and is soon menaced by Deaney in one of two Dune Buggies. They toy with Mitchell, who is on foot. Mitchell grabs a rock and kills one driver who got stuck. Mitchell gets in the Dune Buggy and goes after Deaney in the other. Deaney manages to flip his vehicle and it bursts into flames. Mitchell gets out and stares at the burning wreckage. He lights a cigarette and watches.Mitchell heads home for the night. The next day he is driving back to the Cummings residence. A radio broadcast announces the death of Walter Deaney. Mitchell honks the horn and Cummings comes to the window. A little boy (Todd Bass) approaches the car on a skateboard. He annoys Mitchell to the point where Mitchell tells the kid to piss off and go to hell. Cummings confronts Mitchell at his car and asks Mitchell why he hasn't been arrested. Mitchell tells Cummings he wants the whole crew, Mistretta, Gallano, and the Heroin. Cummings invites him in to the house and tells him what happened with the shipment. He offers to set up everything and hand it over to Mitchell, but he only gets the Heroin and Mistretta. Cummings emphasizes that he is not part of the deal. Mitchell agrees and acts as chauffeur and drives to the docks in Long Beach. The Kef Falcon has unloaded and a customs officer (Rob Narke) wheels a steamer trunk out to the waiting car. The Rich Old Lady (Lillian McBride) signs for it. Mitchell loads the case into the trunk of the car and drives off. They are observed by Benton who calls Cummings from a phone booth. Cummings then calls Mistretta and tells him about Mitchell and the consignment. He plans to take his boat out and knows Mistretta will kill Mitchell. He thinks he's solved his problems. Cummings makes one final call to the police. He reports that Mitchell will be going to see Mistretta and might need some help. Mitchell stops the Cadillac and checks for the heroin in the trunk. He tells the old lady that it is just chalk and she should just walk away from the whole mess. He concludes that Cummings is double-crossing Mistretta and Gallano. Before he drives off, Mitchell stuffs a rag into the gas filler tube on the car. He prepares the car as a bomb if need be. He then drives up to Calabasas and his rendezvous with Mistretta.Cummings and Benton get on the boat and pull out to sea. They are heading to Mexico. Mitchell drives to Mistretta's home. Mistretta and his henchman greet Mitchell. Mitchell feigns surprise at the double-cross. Mistretta reveals that he is going to kill Mitchell and put him on Cummings' boat. Mitchell manages to blow up the car and escape Mistretta and his men, at least initially. A police helicopter provides Mitchell a gun and he kills Mistretta and his three men. The helicopter pilot (Charles A. Tamburro) and the officer (Gary Combs) fly Mitchell to Marina del Rey and land so Mitchell can talk to the Harbor Master. They depart and head south for Mexico looking for the Cummings boat.The officer explains they have a fuel issue and if the boat crosses into Mexican waters they cannot arrest them. Mitchell asks about the large yellow tank they are carrying. The officer ties the rope to the tank and winch. Mitchell intends to use the tank as a battering ram on the boat. It works and Mitchell is able to distract Benton and Cummings long enough to drop down on to the boat. Mitchell manages to dispatch Benton with a boat hook. He tosses Benton's body overboard. He disables the engine. Cummings tries to make a final plea to Mitchell with a half-million dollar bribe. In a scene right out of Key Largo, Cummings feigns disarming himself and surrendering, but Mitchell is in no mood for an arrest. When Cummings turns to face him, armed of course, Mitchell drops him to the deck with a rifle bullet to the forehead.That night, a dead tired Mitchell goes home. He thinks his place has been burglarized and enters with his gun drawn. Greta is in his bed sleeping. He pulls her out and searches the apartment. They are alone. He asks how she got in. She shows him a key. Mitchell is horrified by the mess in the kitchen. He asks her to leave. He takes a shower while Greta cleans up the kitchen. He goes to bed, and Greta asks to join him. He sarcastically chides her, ""What for? Nobody paying you this time."" He smells marihuana, ""That's grass."" He finds a roach in the kitchen trashcan and grabs her and tells her to get her coat. He intends to arrest her again. We close with a freeze frame of Mitchell dragging Greta out of bed. Closing credits roll with the Mitchell theme playing."

However, he first tries to investigate how she became possessed by the devil in the first place. Despite the fact that her personality has now completely blended together with the demonic entity within her, she none the less tells him about the horrific experiences she lived through in the mansion of a twisted Spanish aristocratic family with a dark secret and the devil she met there. Lisa Reiner (Elke Sommer) is a young American woman vacationing in Spain with some friends of hers. During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behavior distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.Soon after, Lisa is struck down by a violent seizure, while the other tourists gather around her. A priest named Father Michael (Robert Alda) approaches and accompanies Lisa and her tourist friend (Kathy Leone) to a local hospital while the EMT's sedate her.At this point, the film switches back and forth between two difference time-lines involving Lisa's adventures, and the possessed Lisa in contemporary time at the local hospital.In the alternate time line, Lisa becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time, though this time he is carrying a full-length, life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square, as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro, he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square, then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next, Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying. These bizarre coincidences begin to terrify Lisa, and the stranger acts as though she is his long-lost lover. Frantic, Lisa pushes him away and the man falls down a flight of stone steps, apparently dead. Lisa runs off in a panic.In the other time line, Father Michael and Lisa's friend are at the hospital and hear Lisa growling and cursing at the orderlies who try to restrain her. Father Michael suspects that Lisa may be possessed by a demon and urges her friend to leave while he keeps an close eye on Lisa. Father Michael enters the room where Lisa is where she yells at him and that he ""smells of incest"".Back in the alternate time line, night falls on the village, and Lisa remains lost. However, her luck seems to be improving when she hitches a ride in a old vintage 1940s limousine which contains Francis Leher (Eduardo Fajardo) and his wife Sophie (Silvia Koscina) whom are driving through the village with their chauffeur George (Gabriele Tinit). But their limousine soon breaks down just outside a old villa on the town's outskirts. The four travelers push their car into the villa grounds and knock on the front door asking for assistance. The villa turns out to be occupied by an elderly blind countess (Alida Valli), and her neurotic son Maximilian (Alessio Orano). When Maximilian spots Lisa, he becomes convinced that she is the reincarnation of a woman that loved and lost.

Lisa is subsequently shocked to discover that Leandro is the family butler, who also recognizes her from their brief meetings earlier, and seems a little too friendly to Lisa.At the hospital in the other time line, Father Michael talks to the doctor examining Lisa about her condition. Father Michael enters Lisa's room again where she is tied down to the bed. The troubled priest tries to communicate with the possessed Lisa who only insults him more and begins to describe a house which great evil resides.Back in the other time line, as Leandro settles Lisa, Francis and Sophie, and George into their living quarters for the night, Lisa jumps with fright when she sees the same man from the village who tried to attack her, staring at her through the window. Lisa tries to get away from the house, but her departure is thwarted by Maximilian, who begs her to stay. As she feels some attraction to the young man, as well as pity for him, Lisa relents.In the contemporary time line, the possessed Lisa is retrained by the doctor and other orderlies in another room while Father Michael watches with interest.In the alternate time line, the four travelers are settled down to dinner, while the food is served by Leandro. Lisa further notices the weird atmosphere of the place, when Maximilian continues to remind Lisa that she has a resemblance towards his lost lover, Elena.

Sophie immediately assumes that her husband did it, and she flees outside into the car where she starts it up, When Francis comes out to stop her from leaving, she runs over him over and over again. But upon returning into the house, Sophie is killed by Maximilian in a hurtful, gory way. It was Maximilian who murdered the chauffeur to prevent Lisa from leaving.In the contemporary time line, Father Michael sets about to try to exorcise the evil spirit from the possessed Lisa who (serving as a type of narrator) recounts her experiences at the mansion in the alternate time line by describing the stories about murder, incest, adultery and Satanism. She begins to vomit up green-colored slime that turns into living toads.In the alternate time line, Maximilian turns his attention to Lisa where it's revealed that the man who pursued Lisa in the village is actually Maximilian's stepfather Carlos (Espartaco Santoni). Like Maximilian, he had previously fallen in love with Elena, the woman displayed in a few old photographs who bears an amazing resemblance to Lisa. Carlos had abandoned the countess and ran off with Elena, who was also Maximilian's lover. Before she had a chance to join him, Maximilian had murdered Elena and stored her body in a concealed room so he could continue to have her, even in death. Apparently when Carlos returned to the village, he assumed after seeing Lisa that she was Elena. Now that Maximilian had murdered Carlos, he puts him display in an open coffin in the parlor so that nobody can take Lisa away from him.In the time line back at the hospital, the possessed Lisa tries to taunt and break down Father Michael by turning into a brunette, nude woman named Anna, whom Father Michael had an affair once.In the alternate time line, when Maximilian decides to share his secret with Lisa about his lost love Elena, he takes her to the concealed room, and shows her Elena's skeletal remains, Lisa finally then backs away in horror and rejects Maximilian. But rather than kill her, he chloroforms Lisa and puts her in the bed next to Elena's remains. Maximilian strips Lisa naked and tries to have sex with the unconscious woman. But in his twisted state of mind, he feels that the skeletal remains of Elena is mocking him and he cannot perform. Apparently deciding that in order to consummate the relationship, he will have to marry her.Maximilian meets his mother in the parlor who's paying respects to her dead husband where he tells her of his intentions. The Countess, jealous of the hold Elena, in the form of Lisa, continues to hold over the men in her life, demands that Maximilian kill Lisa and dispose of her and the rest of the bodies before the police show up looking for her and the other murder victims. But Maximilian's devotion to Lisa is complete, and rather then get rid of her, he stabs his mother dead as she stands by the coffin that contains Carlos' body.All of these events are observed by Leandro, whose presence seem to haunt the villa, and who seems to be orchestrating the bizarre occurrences as some kind of sick game. Unsettled by this act of matricide, Maximilian rushes about the house looking for Leandro who, for once, is nowhere to be found. Instead, Maximilian finds the bodies of all his victims, including the skeletal Elena, seated at the dinner table looking at him. He turns around and sees his undead mother shambling towards him. In shock, Maximilian recoils backwards, only to fall out a second floor window, and onto the spikes of a gate. Emerging from behind the body of the dead Countess, Leandro remarks, ""oh, it slipped"".The next morning, Lisa wakes up, naked and in unfamiliar surroundings. Though it seems to be the exact same concealed room, it is now infested with vegetation and she is alone with no bodies anywhere. Putting her clothes back on, Lisa walks through the house and finds that its entirely deserted. In fact, it looks that nobody has lived in the house for a long time. Confused, but somewhat relieved that the entire night's experience was apparently nothing but a bad dream, Lisa leaves the house and runs into a group of schoolgirls playing ball in the street. The balls rolls in her direction and she catches it. One of the the girls points to Lisa and proclaims her a ghost because nobody has lived in the villa for a hundred years. The girls run away screaming. Lisa walks around a little and within minutes finds herself back in the town square from the beginning of the movie. She is observed by Leandro a short distance away who is being given a mannequin likeness of her.In the final scene, Father Michael arrives at the abandoned mansion where the possessed Lisa described. Father Michael attempts to perform an exorcism on the house, but winds strike him and he gets struck down and blown up by evil lighting, paying the ultimate price for his naivety."

The Magic Flute,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073822/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of the prince Tamino and his zestful sidekick Papageno, who are sent on a mission to save a beautiful princess from the clutches of evil. A production ofWolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera ""The Magic Flute"" is presented, this film which blurs the lines of it as a stage production - not only with aspects of the theater stage shown, but also the occasional shot of the audience members watching it, and the performers going through their backstage routines during intermission - and a movie as the set moves out from the confines of the stage. The actual story concerns Tamino, a prince, falling in love with Pamina solely from seeing her photograph, Pamina's mother, the Queen of the Night, vowing that Pamina will be his if he rescues her from Sarastro, a demon who has captured her. On behalf of the Queen, three of her attendants, ""ladies"", who saved Tamino from a serpent, provide him with a magic flute to entice Pamina, and three child angels, who will act as his guides. The ladies also dispatch the pan-flute playing Papageno, a bird catcher who laments not being married himself, with Tamino, they providing him with magic bells as protection. Tamino will discover that not relayed to him by the Queen and her ladies is as it appears, he and Papageno who will have to go through a trial of enlightenment to reach their desired ends.—Huggo This scintillating screen version ofWolfgang Amadeus Mozart's beloved opera showcasesIngmar Bergman's deep knowledge of music and gift for expressing it cinematically. Casting some of Europe's finest soloists -Josef Köstlinger,Ulrik Cold,Håkan Hagegård, andBirgit Nordinamong them-the director lovingly recreated the baroque theater of Sweden's Drottningholm Palace to stage the story of the prince Tamino and his zestful sidekick Papageno, who are sent on a mission to save a beautiful princess from the clutches of evil. A celebration of love and forgiveness that exhibits a profound appreciation for the artifice and spectacle of the theater, The Magic Flute is among the most exquisite opera films ever made. The Queen of the Night offers her daughter Pamina to Tamino, but he has to bring her back from her father and priest Sarastro. She gives a magic flute to Tamino and magic bells to the bird hunter Papageno, who follows Tamino and wants to find a wife. The duo travels in a journey of love and knowledge.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"

The Travelling Players,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073800/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Greece, 1939-1952: Fascist, Nazi, and Communist conflict, as seen through the eyes of a family of travelling provincial players. A group of traveling players peregrinates through Greece attempting to perform the popular erotic drama Golfo The Shepherdess. In a first level the film focuses on the historical events between 1939 and 1952 as they are experienced by the traveling players and as they affect the villages which they visit: The last year of Metaxas' fascist dictatorship, the war against the Italians, the Nazi occupation, the liberation, the civil war between left and right wingers, the British and American interventionism in the Greek politics. In a second level the characters live their own drama of jealousy and betrayal, with its roots in the ancient myth of the House of Atreus. Agamemnon, a Greek refugee from Minor Asia, goes to war against the Italians in 1940, joins the resistance against the Germans, and is executed by them after being betrayed by Clytemnestra and Aegisthos. Aegisthos, Clytemnestra's lover, is an informer and collaborator working with the German occupiers. Orestes, son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, fights on the side of the leftists, avenges his father's death by killing his mother and Aegisthos. He is arrested in 1949 for his guerrilla activities and is executed in prison in 1951. Electra, his sister, helps the leftists and aids her brother in avenging the treachery of their mother and Aegisthos. After the death of Orestes she continues the work of the troupe and her relationship with Pylades. Chrysotheme, Electra's younger sister, collaborates with the Germans, prostitutes herself during the occupation, sides with the British during liberation, and later marries an American. Pylades, close friend of Orestes, is a Communist who is exiled by the Metaxas regime, joins the guerrillas and is arrested and exiled again. Finally he is forced to sign a written denunciation of the left after torture by the right wing and he is released from prison in 1950.—Alkistis Zografou Spanning thirteen pivotal years, from 1939 to 1952,Theodoros Angelopoulos' ""The Travelling Players"" follows a tight-knit theatrical troupe on a cross-country journey across the rugged Greek province as it puts onSpyridon Peresiadis' famous pastoral melodrama,Golfo (1915). As the turbulent political history of Greece becomes inextricably intertwined with the lives of the long-suffering performers, critical historical events unfold: the 4th of August Regime under the leadership of GeneralIoannis Metaxas, the outbreak and aftermath of World War II, the Greek Civil War, and the 1952 Parliamentary elections held on 16 November 1952.—Nick Riganas Angelopoulos came to international attention with the release in 1975 of ""O Thiassos"" (""The Travelling Players""). The subject of this three-hour-and-forty minute historical epic is the adventures of a group of actors traveling across Greece from 1939 until 1952, performing ""Golfo,"" a traditional 19th Century Greek classic tale of unrequited love. In this way, the film covers the last days of the Metaxas dictatorship, the beginning of the World War II, the German occupation, the Liberation and the arrival of the English and the Americans, and the Civil War. Greece's political history and the actors' lives are being woven together along this journey.I have limited the synopsis to the film's timeline, with minimal commentary about some of the happenings. I hope this timeline will help clarify the contemporary Greek history for the reader, and therefore contribute to a better appreciation of the film.Following the credits, which appear on the background of a red theater curtain, hammering on the floor followed by three distinct thumps announces the beginning of the performance. An old accordion-playing man introduces the play (""Golfo, the Shepherdess,"" by Spyridon Peresiades). The film's main characters are based on Aeschylus' ""Oresteia trilogy"" (""Agamemnon,"" ""The Libation Bearers,"" and ""The Eumenides""), so we get a foreshadowing of their true natures: the father, Agamemnon (Stratos Pachis); the adulterous mother, Clytemnestra (Aliki Georgouli); the traitorous uncle, Aegisthus (Vangelis Kazan); the avenging daughter, Elektra (Eva Kotamanidou); the revolutionary son, Orestes (Petros Zarkadis); and the self-centered daughter, Chrysothemis (Maria Vasileiou). However, Orestes is the only character ever identified by name in the film. We can surmise who the other characters are by the vague mythical elements which surround them, and also by seeing the names listed in the film's credits.Winter, 1952. Cut to a gray winter morning. The nine travelling players are standing in front the Aegion train station, holding their suitcases. The players seem indistinguishable from one another. The troupe walks in the street, seeking a place to stay. Megaphones blare political slogans about Marshal Papagos, a candidate in the next presidential election. The group continues walking, but when they arrive at the town square, it is now fourteen years earlier, in 1939, and they are under the General Metaxas' pro-monarchy dictatorship. The group settles in a restaurant. Outside, Metaxas ""black shirts"" are parading and singing fascist songs. Aegisthus stands on a table and sings an old patriotic ballad, while his companions remain silent. The troupe stays at a nearby hotel for the night. Electra walks on the balcony, and happens by a room from which emanate lovemaking sounds. She peers through the window and sees her mother, Clytemnestra, in the arms of Aegisthus. A while later, a shocked and crying Electra sees her mother return to her own room.Clytemnestra and her husband are in bed, both asleep. Orestes enters the room and kisses his mother. A soldier, he has been called to the border. Although sleeping, Clytemnestra delivers a monologue that recalls an event that happened when Orestes was four years old. Orestes leaves the room and runs into his sister: they embrace and she cries. Later, Agamemnon, carrying his grandchild by Chrysothemis, speaks to Orestes in pessimistic terms about the future.The next scene shows Orestes, his friend -- as in the ancient myth -- Pylades (Kiriakos Katrivanos), and the Poet (Grigoris Evangelatos) walking along the railroad tracks. They speak of the threatening war. Arriving near a river bank, Pylades reads about the conditions for a true Marxist revolution. The three friends join in a chorus singing this Marxist speech, authored by Lenin.The actors are now in a ""kafeneon"" (a typical Greek bar), dressed up in traditional Greek mountain costumes for the performance of ""Golfo."" They stand before the window, advertising the upcoming performance with songs. They are lined up as the puppets in the traditional ""Karaghiozi""s Greek shadow-puppet theater. An accordion provides the accompaniment for the songs which always open such shadow plays. Eventually, the ""Golfo"" performance begins.Later that same night, Pylades is chased down the street by several of Metaxas' secret police. They catch him, and then beat him before pushing him into a car and taking him away. As the next scene opens on a lake at dawn, a boat carrying political prisoners approaches the dock. The police push Pylades and several new prisoners into the boat that will take them to some unknown place of exile. On the dock, Orestes, Electra, and the Poet are silent witnesses.October 28, 1940. The players are on a train. Agamemnon, facing the audience, makes the first of three monologues in the film. He recalls his arrival in 1922 from Ionia, Asia Minor, to Greece, as a refugee. This is quite different from Agamemnon, the King, who returned triumphant from Troy to Argos. The players end up in a small town, where they will be playing ""Golfo"" in a small theater. The play is interrupted by the announcement that at 5:30 in the morning, WWII commenced with the invasion of Greece by Italy. Early the next morning, Agamemnon, wearing a soldier uniform, is seen saying goodbye to Electra and Chrysothemis: the war is breaking up the group.Early 1941. On a gloomy, rainy day, Electra walks down a street. She is being followed by a young fascist Italian soldier. They enter a hotel and go to a room. Electra tells the soldier to strip. Excited, he complies, but when he is finally naked, he gradually becomes uncomfortable and embarrassed by Electra's stillness. Electra, fully clothed, rises and leaves the room. Quite a role reversal!April 27th, 1942. The German army has just entered Athens. The Third Reich flag is raised. The German occupation of Greece has begun.Autumn, 1952. Pylades comes to Elektra's bedroom and says, ""Let's go."" The players walk by the sea. In the background, we hear announcements of the upcoming election over megaphones. Going back to the same location, ten years before, there is a performance of ""Golfo"" being again interrupted, this time with the Germans' arrest of Agamemnon. Aegisthus has betrayed him. In the next scene, Agamemnon is waiting to be executed by a firing squad. He stands before a wall upon which one can read several inscriptions bearing the letters EAM. EAM (""Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo""), the largest of the resistance movements, began operations within months of the German occupation, and was established by the Greek Communist Party, KKE (""Kommunistiko Komma Elladas""). As Agamemnon faces the audience, he identifies himself, ""I come from beyond the sea, from Ionia. And you?"" This is the traditional form for greeting strangers, going back to antiquity. Of course, the greeting is lost on the German soldiers. The soldiers fire and Agamemnon falls to the ground.1943. A line of people waits for some kind of food distribution. Chrysothemis walks to a house, carrying an empty bottle. She knocks at the door. A fat man opens the door and leads her down to the cellar. He taps one of his oil kegs, and waits for payment. Without a word or hesitation, Chrysothemis strips singing ""In your eyes there is a calm sea"" as the merchant sits in his chair, watching her. This scene directly parallels the earlier one between Electra and the fascist Italian soldier. As Chrysothemis leaves the merchant's house, she crosses paths with two men. Shots are heard, and we see the merchant who had come out to lock his door after Chrysothemis' departure slumping to the ground. We speculate that maybe these two men, obviously EAM members, were tipped off by Chrysothemis about this profiteer. Chrysothemis enters the hotel where the players are staying and puts the bottle of oil on the table around which the group is sitting. They all look at it, fascinated.1944. The travelling players walk down a snowy mountain road, singing cheerfully. Their happy song stops at a turn of the road, when they arrive at a large tree from whose branches hang two men. There is no explanation as to their identities. Perhaps they are partisans, hung by the Germans: we are just being confronted with Death. Later, in a rather comical, silent scene, the group surrounds a lone wandering chicken, which ends up in the cooking pot. Here, we are confronted with Hunger.The group is traveling in a bus which is stopped by German soldiers. They are forced out of the bus and are marched to an old castle that serves as a prison camp. Later, they are lined up against a wall to be executed. Aegisthus steps forward and pitifully tries to negotiate, but he collapses, and is carried back to the wall. We hear shots, and the prisoners fall to the ground. However, they are not shot: the prison camp is under attack by the partisans.It is dawn. A large group of people rushes into the prison camp waving a German flag. They climb the embankment and hurl the flag into the sea. Bells ring and everybody is joyous. Partisans on horseback arrive in the camp crying, ""Freedom to the people!"" The war is ended.In a town square, a large crowd is waving Greek, American, and Russian flags. Some shots ring and the crowd runs, leaving behind several dead. That same night, the traveling players try to leave town. They are in the middle of a fire fight between the government soldiers and the EAM partisans. Eventually, the group manages to escape.The group walks along the beach. They are stopped and searched by British soldiers. When the soldiers find that they have encountered a troupe of actors, they request a free performance. The players are only too happy to oblige, and eventually everybody ends up dancing with everybody else, to the music of the eternal accordion. However, the merrymaking is stopped by a single shot that kills one of the soldiers.1945.	Electra walks down the nighttime street. There is a variety of music in the air. She meets Orestes, Pylades, and the Poet, who all wear EAM uniforms. Inside a large building, a performance of ""Golfo"" is under way. Orestes goes onstage, where he shoots his Clytemnestra and Aegisthus to avenge his father's death. The audience stands up and applauds.Moments later, Electra is in her mother's room. She sits on the bed, wearing her mother's coat, when men burst into the room and take her away. They take her to a dark, empty tavern, and wearing clown masks, four of them hold her down while a fifth one rapes her, striking her from time to time. He interrogates her as to the whereabouts of Orestes. Electra reveals nothing. She wakes up by the bank of a river where the rapists have dumped her. She stands, brushes the dirt from her coat, and facing the audience, begins the second monologue of the film. She describes how, following the departure of the Germans, the civil war began. She recounts the battle in Athens between the government troops and the communist Partisans.In a town square are assembled British, American, and French soldiers. They are supervising the agreement which will end the Allied occupation. One by one, on horseback, the communist Partisans come and surrender their weapons.Electra is in her room. We hear Chysothemis' young son reading a war story. Chrysothemis is packing to leave the group, and her son. The sisters meet silently in the hallway. Three men enter Electra's room and ransack it. They leave three pictures of Orestes in his ""andartis"" (communist partisan) uniform on the table. Electra goes out in the night. Right-wing slogans are being broadcast from a PA system. As she passes a ""kafeneon,"" she sees several people being dragged out by right-wing thugs.1946. Electra walks into a nightclub: a sign advertises a special dance for January 1, 1946. She walks across the room and stands by the orchestra. An all-male group of right-wing government supporters is seated at a table. They are drably dressed in cheap suits and hats. Another group consisting of couples, dressed in a more eclectic and colorful fashion, is seated near the orchestra. They represent the Left. These two groups start a musical duel, each singing songs pertinent to its ideology. Finally, a right-wing man pulls out a hand gun and shoots into the air. The music stops. The left-wing couples indicate they are not armed and walk out of the establishment. The fascists stand up, and pairing off, dance. Electra leaves the hall.The group of right-wing men is walking through the empty street at dawn. When they reach the square, it is now 1952, and a royalist government rally is taking place. Electra and the travelling players are making their way through the crowd.1949.	In a street, a small band leads a jeep carrying soldiers. As the group nears, we see a soldier standing up, holding in each hand the decapitated head of a communist -- a common fate for communists captured during the civil war. Following the jeep is a group of communist prisoners. Among them is Orestes.1950. In the harbor, a boat seen earlier taking prisoners away to exile brings back some prisoners to be released. Pylades is one of them. He meets Electra and they walk together to a ""kafeneon."" There, Pylades delivers the third monologue of the film. He explains how he was captured in 1947 and sent to detention. Like so many, he was tortured so he would sign a confession, but he never did.Chrysothemis and an American soldier are getting married. The wedding is taking place on the beach. Chrysothemis introduces her husband to Electra and her now teenage son, but both remain silent. The wedding feast continues with American and Greek songs, and someone calls for a toast. At this, Chrysothemis' son rises and walks off, in obvious protest, dragging the tablecloth with him. Everything on the table crashes to the ground.1951. Electra travels to a prison by the sea. She is taken to the morgue, where Orestes' body is laid on a table. She stares at the body from the doorway for a while. She then approaches her brother's corpse and murmurs a line from ""Golfo,"" ""Good morning, Tasso,"" in remembrance of Orestes' role in the play. In the next scene, the players follow the Orestes' hearse to the burial ground. The group stands by the grave, and as two men shovel dirt onto the coffin, Electra suddenly applauds, and the whole group follows, as a salute to Orestes' brave life.1952. People enter an old theater, where the players are to present yet another show of ""Golfo."" Electra helps Chrysothemis' son, who is now dressed up as a Greek shepherd, assuming Orestes' former role of Tasso. It is now Pylades, banging the hammer against the floor, who announces the performance. The accordion plays. The show must go on.Autumn, 1939. In the town of Aegion, the traveling players have arrived, carrying their suitcases, as we saw them at the beginning of the film. The cycle is complete."

She spits on his face, but he slaps her hard enough to send her to the ground, and takes her to prison.Meanwhile, Claire (REGINA CARROL) , a sexy blonde dressing in black nylons and colorful decollete dress, takes a load of bank notes from the old man that is asleep after spending the night with her, and she places the money into her saloon-girl outfit. John (Hugh Warden) wakes up and starts crying, while the piano is still playing downstairs, and she starts shooting at him, more to frighten him that actually aiming at him. Sheriff Clay enters the bedroom and grabs the blonde girl from behind. Clay arrests her, saying, ""You again, Claire?"" and takes her to prison.Meanwhile, Brock's gang is robbing the Twin Cities Bank. The men come out with the bags of money, jump on their horses that had been kept quiet outside by a mixed-blood girl with long black tresses, an Indian skirt and a Mexican sombrero. The girl tries to mount the last horse, and calls out for her man, Link (BIGG YEAGER) [though she calls him Frankie] not to leave her behind. But so he does. Yet, when the Bank Teller (Joe ArrowSmith) comes out with a shot-gun to shoot the bandit, Kana (ELLYN STERN) stabs the Bank Teller in the back to prevent him shooting. Sheriff Clay arrives just in time to see the murder, disarm and arrest Kana - a girl that worked at the local saloon.The stories of the three girls are given in parallel with Jessi's long recuperation, and learning about guns. Jessica is intent on avenging her husband's death and proves to be a good pupil. Then she says her good-bye to Rufe, and sets off to track down the gang. Rufe offers her his best horse: he does not believe in gods, nor in lawmen - these are the worst of all - it's his last advice to her.Indeed, Jessi comes across a two-horse cart going to Tucson Prison, driven by Shag (William Hammer) and the Sheriff, who are finding it difficult to resist the temptation of three beautiful girls and the lurid remarks from Claire, the prostitute. Jessi stops the cart with a shot in the air. Shag sees that she she is just another woman, and pulls his rifle to shoot her down; Jessi shoots first, and he dies. The Sheriff also tries to pull his gun, discreetly, and she wounds him. She presents herself, and the talkative Claire assumes she is a robber; Rachel is going to kill the Sheriff but is stopped by Jessi, who doesn't allow unnecessary killings. Kana admits that she has nothing else to do but go along with Jessi, ""for the time being"". The three girls accept Jessi has their leader. With the extra horse, they manage to drive for a while. Jessi tends to the Sheriff, trying to get information about the Brock's gang, but that makes the other girl criminals suspicious of her. Therefore, Jessi has to tell them her plan, and promises to divide the money if and when they catch up with Brock's gang.Jessi finds Sheriff Clay the same age as her late husband, and handsome enough to untie him and make love to him, finally getting the information that Brock is probably at Copper Creek. Then, during the night, the Sheriff escapes and starts tracking the girls, whilst they are tracking the gang.The girls see Slime (Jon Shark) walking the desert alone, carrying a horse-saddle on his shoulder. He is glad to find company, saying that he had to shoot his horse after a fall in the mountain track; then he recognizes Kana, and therefore he exposes that she was related to Brock's gang. Jessi does not seem worried with this revelation, and Kana keeps her mouth shut as usual. Jessi sends the man away, only to use his back for target shooting - and she does not miss.Next they separate: Rachel is going to inspect a cabin where the bandits may be in, but it's empty; the other three girls come across Baldry (Joseph Cortese) and Moose (John Durren) on horseback, forcing an Indian (Gavin Murrell) to follow them, tied by a piece of rope to Moose's saddle. The bandits had been laughing and torturing the Indian, who was in poor condition already. The girls hold Moose in respect, but Baldry comes from behind Kana, and points his pistol to her head. The other girls must put their guns down. Rachel appears then, and forces Baldry to drop his gun. When Moose goes for his gun, Rachel shoots him, but can't avoid being shot herself - dead. Baldry is interrogated, and confirms that Brock and Link are at Copper Creek, to divide the money, and join with other bandits for the next robbery. Then, Jessi shoots him down on the road, by his partner.Claire tends to the Indian wounds, and he acts as scout for the group, but they must stop at a barn, to tend to the horses and to wait for the Indian to recuperate his strength for the journey. Claire goes into the barn to take care of him.""Kana, why don't you go in to help her?"" Jessi asks.""Apache?! (spitting on the ground) Kana doesn't help the Apaches!"" Her attitude hints at a possible rape of her Mexican mother by an Apache warrior.In the barn, Claire tends to the Apache so well that he is able to make love to her, with the blonde on top [cut in some versions].Meanwhile, the Sheriff finds Slime's body.Claire leaves the barn and tells Jessi that she decided to stay behind with the Apache, risking her life with his, while he rests from his wounds. She doesn't want her share of the money, if and when Jessi catches the Brock's gang.Kana doesn't hear this, and since the Apache was delaying the group's departure, enters the barn with her knife - and [off camera] kills him. The blonde sees Kana leaving the barn, goes inside in a hurry, and finds the Apache dead.Claire roars, and runs out of the barn, her blonde hair flowing, and launches herself against the murderess's back; as she turns around to face her, Claire gives her a punch that sends Kana down and her Mexican sombrero flying. Kana turns around and still on her knees, she pulls her big knife with which she has just killed the Apache. Claire gestures with her hands, teasing the man to attack her.Kana is getting up yielding her knife, but Claire immediately kicks her head, making her to loose the weapon. Kana rolls around to get away from Claire, and then the blonde pounces on her, and they attempt to strangle each other, rolling around fiercely on the ground. Both are in rough trousers and men's shirts, plus cowboy boots and heavy leather belts. The man wears white flimsy embroidered shirt and brown trousers, the blonde in a red shirt and blue cotton trousers, and with a bandanna around her neck. Both girls take a lot of punishment. Kana starts strangling her opponent, but is knocked aside with a punch to her head. Claire gets the upper position. Kana delivers an uppercut that sends the blonde rolling a couple of feet away, as her unbuttoned shirt shows the valley of her breasts. Both girls stand up and engage in a punch-up like men. Kana hits Clare's cheek with her right, Claire is shaken but reacts with a left that also forces the man to step back. They exchange a pair of punches each. The Indian walks forward still dizzy from earlier punches to the head, and takes another straight punch to the jaw. However, she takes it well, just backing down a little, and surprises the blonde with a similar punch. It's Claire who falls on her rump, though she gets up promptly and pays back via a mean kick to the crotch that makes Kana stagger, double over and grab her wounded belly to assuage her pain. She throws herself against the blonde and knees her high under the heavy breasts, making Claire shout out and double-up in pain, too. Kana tries to gain some space, and the blonde tackles her from behind. Again they arm-wrestle for control, rolling on the uneven ground.Jessi approaches, and shouts, ""That's enough!"" Claire doesn't hear, or doesn't care, and punches the retreating Kana between the breasts. They wrestle more on the ground, get to their feet, and the blonde is knocked down again with a punch to her head; she lays spreadeagled on the ground, and Kana gets hold of her Bowie knife again. Before she can kill her opponent, Jessica stops her by shouting her name, «Kana!» and shooting a warning shot. Both fighters stay put, breathing hard, and getting to their senses after the violent confrontation.On the move again, Kana stays with her horse behind the other two cowgirls, and takes a separate route. Claire calls Jessi's attention to her departure, and then tells her that she, too, does not want to go along with her to what in her view is a suicide mission. Claire says that Jessi has hated so much for so long, that she's unable of love, and that would make all the girls savages. Jessi argues that until she kills all the bandits who murdered her husband, she is not able to feel love again.Meanwhile, Sheriff Clay finds the bodies of the two gangsters on the road, and goes on his pursuit - without bothering to bury them.Kana arrives first at Copper Creek, a ghost town, and heads to the Pop Bar. Brock sends her to Link. She says she is mad at him for letting her behind and be arrested, but soon accepts his caresses. Link [who is called Frankie in some video versions] winks at Brock over Kana's shoulder, and goes inside a building to make love to her. Afterwards, Kana tells him, ""Slime, Moose, and Baldry are dead; and Jessi is coming for you next!"" Link is not too worried, as Brock has set his five new gangsters in ambush already, waiting for the Mormon girl.Jessi arrives alone, but before she enters Copper Creek, she is joined by Claire, who decided to risk her life out of loyalty to the girl avenger.As the girls drive their horses into the main street, a gun battle ensues. Gangster #1 falls off a rooftop, Gangster #2 from a first floor window, Gangster #3 from another rooftop. Claire gets shot once in the right shoulder, and tries to ramp away somewhere to hide, but then she is finished off with another shot in the heart by Brock, whom Jessi shoots down, a little later.Kana goes for Link with her knife when he is hiding at a street corner, but he moves and the knife sticks to the wooden wall instead. He pushes her to the ground, she pleads ""No!"" lying helpless on her back, but he shoots her point blank in the chest, killing her.Jessi uses sticks of dynamite to kill Gangster #4 in the saloon and Gangster #5 on a water tower. Sheriff Clay re-enters the scene, just in time to wound Link, whose shot also wounds Jessi. In a gun duel, face to face, Jessi puts a number of bullets in Link.The Sheriff compliments her on her well aimed shots. The Sheriff takes a leather belt hidden under Brock's shirt, and then draws treacherously on Jessi. In the ensuing duel, she prevails. Jessi has avenged her husband's death, and killed yet an unlawful sheriff."

Notable songs are :Sare ga ma, ma sa re ga ma....""; ""Ab ke sajan sawan me, aag lagegi badan mein, ghata barshegi, magar tarsegi nazar, mil na sakenghe do mahn ek hi aagan mein...""; ""Chupke chupke chal di purvaiya, basuri bajaike raas rachaye daiya re daiya, chupke..."".—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Professor Parimal Tripathi (Dharmendra) is a botany professor who falls in love with Sulekha Chaturvedi (Sharmila Tagore) during a women's college botany excursion. Prof. Parimal Tripathi helps the bungalow watchman to get to his village downhill to enable him to see his grandson who's fallen ill. Meanwhile, he disguises himself as the bungalow watchman to protect the old man's job. Sulekha finds out one day about the cover-up and is charmed on seeing Parimal's real personality. They both get married. Parimal loves playing pranks and is the antithesis of regular professors. Sulekha, on the other hand is in awe of her jijaji (brother-in-law) Raghavendra (Om Prakash). She considers her jijaji to be highly intellectual and looks upon him as her idol. Parimal develops an inferiority complex thanks to Sulekha's excessive praise of her jijaji and decides to prove that he is in no way a lesser mortal. Jijaji, meanwhile, has written a letter to Haripad bhaiyya (David Abraham Cheulkar) asking him to send a driver who can speak good Hindi because his present driver James D'costa (Keshto Mukherjee) uses improper dialect. This provides the perfect opportunity for Parimal to get to see and interact with jijaji. Parimal becomes Pyare Mohan Ilahabadi, a motor-mouth driver who pretends to hate the English language and so speaks only Hindi. So begins the comedy of errors, as Parimal and Sulekha play prank after prank on the unsuspecting jijaji.First they pretend that Sulekha is not happy with her new marriage, then they put across the impression that Sulekha is having an affair with Pyare Mohan, and if that was not enough, they get Parimal's long-time friend Sukumar Sinha (Amitabh Bachchan), a professor of English literature, to temporarily act as Parimal and portray him as a serious and boring lecturer, the complete opposite of Parimal's character. Pyare Mohan's excessively refined Hindi, his habit of correcting Jijaji's usage of the language and his persistence in getting jijaji to teach him English all serve to irk Jijaji to no end and provide for many laughs. Parimal's long-time friend P K Srivastava (Asrani) is also party to the prank. His sister-in-law Vasudha (Jaya Bachchan) suspects fake 'Parimal' - Sukumar Sinha - of infidelity to his wife 'Sulekha' when he tries to get close to her. Sukumar falls in love with Vasudha who at first believed he was Parimal, but Sukumar reveals to her the real drama behind all this mix-up of situations. Lata Srivastava (Lily Chakravarty), P K Srivastava's wife, is also angered over the latest 'extra-marital' love affair. But toward the end, Sukumar and Vasudha end up marrying in a temple where Haripat Bhaiyya coerces Pyare Mohan to 'kill' himself so that Parimal could surface. Thus jijaji comes to comprehend the whole enactment, finally admitting that he was truly fooled. The film revolves around the resolution of these funny mishaps."

But after the superticous Nicosia has an encounter with an elderly gypsy aunt, and a business trip to Romania results in another encounter with a suave vampire, named Count Dragalescu, Nicosia returns with blood-sucking like qualities which makes him re-examine his life and existence.—Anonymous Costante Nicosia (Lando Buzzanca) is a boorish, irascible, man having married for wealth. He is the new boss of a recently inherited toothpaste factory and the owner of a local Rome basketball team which the film opens during a game. ""The only reason I own this bunch of dippy dribblers is to push toothpaste to those sports nuts out there,"" says Nicosia to his hunchbacked side-kick Peppino (Antonio Aliocca). He is also extremely superstitious. Peppino is less of a friend than a good luck charm as far as the insensitive Nicosia is concerned. He believes that it brings good luck to rub a hunchback's hump so that his basketball team will win the game.The signs and omens are all against this wealthy rat: a black cat crosses his path, and worst still he breaks a mirror in his apartment. Superstition demands that he persuade a virgin to urinate over the broken shards of glass in order to halt the tide of bad luck. Abusively, he passes a decrepit old spinster who lives next door to him mistakenly assuming that she has never done the deed. Nicosias relationship with his wife Mariu (Sylva Koscina) is scarcely more convivial for he states to her, ""I always have good luck with things that rhyme with the letter U, except you!""Reluctantly bowing to family pressure, Nicosia employs his loafing brother-in-law into a menial post at the factory. But he fires him the following day after catching the man asleep on the job, snoring loudly. That evening at a family gathering at his apartment, he is accosted by his ungrateful in-laws who try to shame him into giving the feckless mans his job back. Instead of acquiescing to family practice, he bursts into an escalating tirade of rudeness against the singers figure of his Great Aunt Maria (Grazia Spadaro). The old woman finally responds to his cynical remarks by uttering a curse. Nicosia spits with derision at first, that is until the old hag threatens of pour oil onto the floor; this heavy duty bit of magical business breaks Nicosia's nerve, and he recants in a babbling panic. But its too late as Nicosia grovels for the curse to be lifted, and the old woman has the last laugh.A few days later, Nicosia is on a plane to Bucharest, Romania where he expects to attend a business conference. A tall, gaunt, suave man seated nearby introduces himself as Count Dragalescu (John Steiner), and after some small talk, he invites the troubled industrialist to visit him at his castle while in the region. Upon arriving at the hotel, Nicosia discovers that the conference has been postponed, leaving him stranded at the hotel for the entire weekend. Another businessman, named Meniconi (Franco Nebbia), tells him that there are no prostitutes to be had in the region, and that he has failed to seduce any of the local women, even after buying sexy lingerie to bribe them. He confides to Nicosia that he has taken to wearing the lingerie, brand name: 'Hot Night in Havana' himself.Rather the spend the weekend in this wretched resort, Nicosia decides to call on the Count. Upon arriving in a taxi, Nicosia sees that the castle is very much what one would expect from a Romanian nobleman's abode, complete with lighting and thunder to amplify the Gothic effect. Count Dragalescu greets his guest in the cavernous dining hall. Suddenly, a gay bunch of revelers stagger down the large staircase into the dining hall. The Count introduces his companions (three women and a man) to the wary guest. The women greet Nicosia in a lavish, tactile manner. When Boris, the screaming camp male of the party, tries to greet Nicosia too, he backs up nervously away and declines.Laughing, the Count sends Nicosia up to his room to prepare for dinner. When Nicosia later comes back down the stairs, well dressed in a tuxedo, he finds himself overdressed for the occasion. ""Dinner in Transylvania's always in the nude!"" purrs Dragalescu. The evening gets even more debauched when Nicosia has a little too much to drink, strips off too, cavorts with some of the assembled throng, and then passed out cold. The next morning, he wakes up in his bed with the mirthfully grinning Dragalescu to his side. Running away half-dressed and in horror from the castle, Nicosia catches the first plane back to Italy.Back at his little toothpaste empire, Nicosia is rather tense and uptight. He greets all his employees with who speak to him with a clenched, furious, ""Up yours! Up yours!"" While overseeing his basketball team at practice, he is knocked off balance when the coach tells the team, ""you've got the big one!"" Nicosia repeats the phrase ""big one"" over and over, and then collapses in the locker room when he sees a row of naked men's bottoms in the showers. Nicosia goes to his physician Dr. Paluzzi (Rossano Brazzi) who suggests that he try making out with his mistress, and if he can't do that, the doctor adds that he must have been ""deflowered while drunk."" This attempt to re-establish his heterosexuality fails, however because the tormented Nicosia feels compelled to bite her with and suck blood out of her neck.Even more stricken, first with anxiety and then with abject self-pity, Nicosia calls on Great Aunt Maria to beg her to remove the curse, which he assumes, is responsible for his misfortune of homosexuality and blood craving. However, she claims that she had nothing to do with his urge for blood. She recommends that he visit the Magician of Noto (Ciccio Ingrassia) in Sicily for help and he complies in desperation. Upon arriving at the Magician of Noto's residence, Nicosia clearly sees from the posture and tone of voice, the magician is clearly a fake. But Nicosia accepts his advice: the curse on him will be lifted only if he re-employs his brother-in-law. Nicosia leaves, where its revealed to the viewers that the whole thing was a deliberate stunt organized by his in-laws into tricking Nicosia into giving his brother-in-law's job back. Returning home far from being cured, he responds to his needy wife's sexual advances by plunging his fang-like teeth into her bare bottom during foreplay. All seems lost to the once arrogant entrepreneur.Over the next few months, Nicosia adopts a devil-may-care aggression; he re-fires his lazy brother-in-law, arranges to visit prostitutes to satisfy his urge to bite, and isolates himself from family and friends. Finally he satisfies his craving for blood by setting up a blood-bank at his factory-site and compelling all employees to attend. Just as he seems to have surrendered to total cynicism, his wife arrives at the factory with a baby, his newborn son that was conceived that night of their passion.In the final scene, Nicosia throws a party to celebrate his son's birth. Rejoicing at his proof of his potency, Nicosia throws off the shackles of his superstitious paranoia and goes to greet and hold his baby son. Only to discover that the baby sports a protruding pair of fangs..."

Though the reporter points out that her popularity has increased significantly since Hermanns death. Corinna says she will continue to focus on her art and will possibily perform in Frankfurt in the near future. Karl and Marianne appear and comfort Emma, asking her to have coffee with them.
At Marianne and Karls house, Emma is served coffee and speaks to Marianne about Hermanns death. After years of nothing, overnight, everything comes crashing down on you. Karl comes in and insists that there is a lesson to be learned in all of this. Karl tells Emma that what Hermann did was actually considered in a sense, revolutionary despite the papers calling him crazy. Karl argues that Hermanns problem is a problem of all workers. Only when they are strong and united can changes occur says Karl. A killing, however, does not help the cause. Emma says that she never felt Hermann to be oppressed by any means. Karl then argues that there doesnt need to be a society of servants and masters, but a Socialist society where everyone works together as a unit. Marianne then points out that factories all around Germany are making small profits for what they sell, and the business owners are reaping most of the money. The Capitalists are consuming the profits and that is unjust, she says. When there is a crisis, the Capitalist push the burden onto the workers and therefore they are fired or laid off. Karl and Marianne argue that Hermann did not want to accept this truth and took action, but in the wrong manner. Emma states that Hermann was always one to think of others first over himself. Karl takes a drink before declaring his and Mariannes true identities as Communists. Emma thanks the two for their company and leaves. They both tell Emma that she is welcome back anytime. Niemeyer and Corinna are seen in bed together. Corinna is then seen back at her mothers house, as Emma explains the meeting she had with the two Communists. Corinna is unsure about Karl and Marianne, but Emma assures her that they are good people.Back at Karl and Mariannes, they speak of Emma. Marianne think they scared her off with their wild Communist theories, though Karl thinks otherwise. They hope to use Emma to their partys benefit.Corinna and Niemeyer are at a local bar watching a man dressed as a woman performs on stage. The owner says that pretty much anyone can perform here as long as they have some musical ability. The main thing is that the audience is interested and drinks a lot. The owner recognizes Corinna as the daughter of the murderer and asks if she is OK with it. She agrees to perform.
Back at the house, Corinna is using the typewriter while Emma reads the newspaper aloud. A light melody plays in the background. The paper describes Hermann as a drunkard and a tyrant who beat his family and haggard, aged wife. The article then mentions Corinna in a positive light, as she wanted to study even though her father did not agree with it. Emma is upset with Niemeyers article as it did not present the truth as he said it would. Corinna defends Niemeyer, saying that he was just trying to do his job. Emma is upset with Corinna and Niemeyer, swearing to call them to account for their mistakes.Emma visits the pension office to discuss the death of her husband. A man, Mr Holzapfel, explains to Emma that since his murder was no accident and that he did indeed kill a man, Dr Berthold, during the incident, Emma has no legal claim. Back home, Corinna is packing to move out. Emma is upset, because she feels as if everyone is deserting her, especially in her time of need. Emma begins to cry as she realizes Corinna is moving in with Niemeyer.Emma is in a phone booth speaking to Karl. She wants to come by and talk as she feels all alone. Karl is excited that Emma is coming by. Emma agrees, hangs up the phone, and enters the subway station.Marianne greets Emma at the door as shows her inside. Marianne makes coffee as Karl asks to show Emma something. Emma sits down and Karl pulls out his newspaper in which he has written an article about Hermanns case. Karl wants Emma to compare Niemeyers story with his. Emma agrees that Niemeyers article was terrible. She calls Niemeyer a filthy swin and an animal. Karl asks Emma to read his article. Emma likes his article much better, though she realizes not many people will read it as it is a Communist newspaper. Emma thanks Karl for writing the article and Karl claims it was his duty to write the truth. Back at the house, Ernst drinks and tells his mother about the horrible vacation to Finland. Helene is upset with Ernst who was lazy the entire trip. Emma supports her son for relaxing. Helene gets upset as she always feels ganged by the mother and son duo, she threatens to move out. Helene calls a couple ads in the newspaper looking for a furnished apartment for three. Emma is upset with both Helene and Ernst and asks them to move out, as she will be better off on her own. The door bell rings, its Corinna who comes in to pick up some stuff she forgot. She asks Ernst and Emma to come to watch her sing in Frankfurt. They agree.At the show, the announcer expresses his wonder for Corinnas powerful voice. Along with Emma and Ernst, Niemeyer watches from the crowd. The announcer then introduces the sensation as the daughter of the factory murderer. Emma cant believe it. Corinna comes out and sings a very depressing song. Niemeyer takes more pictures as Corinna sings. As Corinna ends her song and the audience claps, Emma cries and leaves with Ernst. Again at the house, Ernst and Emma work on the electrical outlets. Helene brags about the apartment she has found. Ernst leaves Emma alone at the table to help Helene pack.Emma visits Marianne and Karl once again. Marianne invites her in for sandwiches. Emma tells Marianne her troubles of living alone. Karl comes down the stairs and invites Emma to come along with them to meet some comrades.Emma sits at the table assembling the small electrical outlets by herself. The door bell rings, its Ernst, who asks to come in. The baby has been born and has been keeping him up at night. He sits and helps his mother. She tells him that she has joined the German Communist Party along with Karl and Marianne. She tells Ernst that she is beginning to understand why Hermann did the things he did. Ernst is happy to see his mother progressing; he leaves to return to Helene and the baby.Emma attends a Communist Party meeting in which Karl speaks to the audience. Karl talks about the struggle of the working class and Socialism. The audience applauds after Karls speech. Another man stands up and introduces Emma to the audience, who will also make a speech. Emma explains that she never has spoken to such a large crowd, though she will try her best. She explains that not everything is God-given or of fate, but theres a reason for everything terrible that happens in the world. She explains how she thought she knew Hermann, but apparently she did not, even after 40 years of marriage. How can we really know anyone, she asks. She claims that her husband was not a murderer or a crazy person and that the magazines are filled with nothing but lies. He is a man who hit back, because he was beaten all his life. A camera and tape recorder captures Emma on the stand as the audience applauds. Emma walks out and a man, Horst Knab, greets her. He tells her that he appreciated her speech, though the people in the room are using her for the wrong reasons. He says that the Party is all talk and no action. He tells Emma that she needs to take action to bring them out of their sleep. Horst leaves a confused Emma.After the meeting, Emma walks with Marianne and Karl down a sidewalk at night. Marianne tells Emma that the party members were very impressed and touched by her speech. Emma then tells the two that she was approached by Horst who told her she needed to take an action. Karl tells Emma that Horst is one who wishes to destroy, rather than build and he does not even talk with Horst anymore. He describes Horsts group as anarchists and enemies of the Communist movement. They walk Emma to her home and say goodnight. Marianne warns Karl that he promised Emma too much. Emma looks back at the two as if he heard what they said.Emma meets with Marianne and Karl, upset that the party has not taken any action in helping her with Hermanns image and rehabilitation. She wonders why the truth has not been revealed to the people. Karl assures her that it is a slow process and she must be patient. Emma becomes angry, wanting to act now, but Karl tells her that they are very busy at the moment with an election campaign. Karl says the partys main task is to gain more voters. Emma leaves disappointed.Back at the house she continues to assemble electrical sockets, Horst is there. Horst tells her that her party is small with limited power and courage. Horst tells her that his party is free of rules and constitutions. Though their group is even smaller than the Communists, they make up for it with spirit and guts. He suggests going to the editorial office with Emma and 4 or 5 others and sitting on the floor until their demands are met. Emma tells him shell think it over.Emma, Horst, a few others walk up the stairs of the editorial office demanding to speak with Niemeyer. The woman tells them that Niemeyer is not there and that the editor is in a meeting. Horst tells her to pull him out of the meeting as they have important information. Dr. Linke comes out and greets the group. Emma introduces herself as Mrs. Kusters. Linke recognizes her name and Horst steps into the conversation. Horst accuses Linke of defamation to Hermanns and the Kusters name. Emma demands Linke to reprint the truth about her husband. Linke tells Emma that a retraction cannot be made every time someone complains. He suggests Emma write a readers letter, but she declines as she cannot wait any longer. Linke asks the group to leave. Horst pulls out a gun and puts it up to Linke, another member pulls out an automatic weapon. Emma cannot believe it. Horst declares that everyone in the office is a hostage. Horst orders Linke to call Niemeyer. The phone rings at Niemeyers apartment, he sits reading the paper while Corinna paints her toenails, half-naked in the background. Niemeyer hangs up the phone telling Corinna that her mother and some anarchists have taken hostages at the editorial office. Corinna doesnt believe that her mother is with them. Niemeyer leaves as Corinna sits confused.Back at the office, Horst is on the phone calling themselves the Kusters Kommandos. He tells the person on the phone that the hostages will be shot if their demands are not met. Horst demands restitution for the article written about a lone revolutionary, Hermann Kusters. In Hermanns honor, Horst demands the release of all political prisons held captive in the Federal Republic of Germany. Horst hangs up. The phone rings again, its the chief of police. Horst demands free passage with the hostages in a Mercedes 600. Also, he wants a Boeing 707 with a crew of four ready for takeoff to leave the country. Before hanging up the phone he finishes with long live the revolution. Niemeyer arrives asking Emma to stop the war games. Horst orders Niemeyer against the wall with the others. The phone rings again. Horst answers and says that they will take Linke and Niemeyer as hostages once the car arrives. If the car is not there within one hour, a hostage will be shot.The film ends with titles. Apparently, the German version does not have the final scenes so the director, Fassbinder, had to insert titles in their place.In the German version, the group goes outside to the waiting car. People and police surround the borders. Ernst sees his mother and breaks through the barrier. He runs to her. Just then, Emma is shot and falls to the ground. Horst shoots and kills Linke, before he is shot by police. Corinna runs to her mothers side as she lies dead in the street. Corinna poses for a picture lying next to her dead mother."

Dr. Rawley and many in the family fear for Helen's life as a potential next victim.

After she misses her train, a young woman is forced to hitch a ride back to town. After managing to get away from a lecherous trucker, she is given a ride by a good-looking but somewhat mysterious young man, who she comes to suspect may be a dangerous escapee from a mental asylum.—frankfob2@yahoo.com News which has yet to hit the media, but which has hit informal local gossip channels, is that a patient at Greenwood, an institution for the criminally insane, has escaped. That gossip does not largely include the fact of several murders that have occurred since, the perpetrator most certainly the escapee. Concurrently, a young woman named Belle Adams (Hayley Mills), travelling on her own, is trying to make her way from the Greenwood area to the south coast, specifically to Wickham where she has a compulsion to visit, and where she has not been since she lived there when she was a child. Following the deaths of her parents in a car accident, she became a ward of her uncle, that being the reason for moving from Wickham. Out of circumstance, she changes what was her original plan of taking the train to Wickham, to accepting vehicle rides from strangers, including Jim Nicholls (Ken Hutchison), a lecherous lorry driver, and Malcolm Robarts (Sterling Hayden), an eccentric older American expatriate who still retains a romantic sensibility. Who Belle ends up spending most of the time with on her trek is a young Birmingham-based travelling salesman named Stephen Slade (Simon Ward), who demonstrates that he has a bit of a temper and imbibes just a little too much, perhaps to calm his nerves which can spark his temper. Belle and Stephen's interactions with each other are colored by relationships from their past, Belle's with her uncle, and Stephen's with an ex-girlfriend.

Could these lies be hiding that he is the escapee and thus a murderer?—Huggo DEADLY STRANGERS-SynopsisA nurse prepares a syringe and wheels her med cart down the hall of a hospital. As she passes a room with an open door, we see a doctor who has just given a shot to a young man. The nurse proceeds to Room 12 where she looks through a peephole and sees what looks like a patient covered up in bed. Unlocking the door, she enters with a med tray and sets it on a table. She closes the room door and walks to the open window, closing it and pulling the curtain. As she turns back, someone grabs the syringe and gives the injection to her. There is a great struggle as the nurse is forced back upon the bed, her dress lifted up. Next we see a shadowy figure exit the room. At the exit door a man is struck down, allowing the figure to leave the building. The doctor then notices the med cart and looks in the room where the nurse was going. He opens the door and goes in. Outside we see the path taken through woods from the escapee's point of view. [TITLE SHOWS]A couple watching television hear a noise in the house. The woman urges the man to investigate. They go into a bedroom which has been ransacked. The window is standing open as someone obviously has gone out.A man driving a car stops to make a phone call and hears someone starting his car. He runs out, shouting at the driver, who then runs him over. The car stops briefly as if checking to see the man is dead, and then drives off.A large tanker truck pulls into a truck stop and the truck driver Jim Nicholls (Ken Hutchison) goes into the Roadhouse Diner to eat. Shown in the parking lot is the blue Austin Maxi which was stolen from the man in the phone booth.Jim calls for bacon and eggs as he makes his way in. Standing nearby is Stephen Slade (Simon Ward) who is playing a slot machine and nursing a glass of whiskey. Jim orders ""the usual"" from the waitress at the bar and tells the barman he is late because someone escaped from Greenwood Sanitarium and the roads are blocked.Glancing in the mirror in front of him, Stephen notices a woman entering. Belle Adams (Hayley Mills) asks the barman how to get to Greenwood Station. He tells her the last bus has just left and there are no cabs. Thinking of Jim, he asks her to wait. Jim is talked into taking Belle with him since he is going that way and no lady should be out by herself with a maniac loose.Jim helps Belle into the cab of the truck and gets in on the driver's side. Starting the motor, Jim looks at her legs as they drive off. Stephen, having observed all this, gets in the blue car and takes a swig of whiskey. Suddenly a police car pulls into the parking lot with siren on. Two policemen enter the Roadhouse as Stephen drives off and begins following them. Showing a picture of the escapee (not to the camera), the cop is told the person was just here by the barman.Down the road, Jim asks Belle what time her train leaves and she replies two o'clock. He implies that it should be no problem. Seeing a roadblock ahead, he tells her to get down and covers her with a coat so the police will not see her. The officers stop him and ask where he's coming from. One cop looks under the truck and sees nothing, giving the all-clear sign to his partner. Driving on, Jim tells her to get up. He says he could lose his job if she were found riding along. She says she can't thank him enough. He replies, want to bet? Looking again at her legs, he asks if she is a model. She replies no, and says that she is grateful. He tells her that he hoped she would say that and pulls the truck over to the side of the road. When she asks what is wrong, he tells her that they need to settle the fare. He moves on her and a struggle ensues. Belle falls out of the truck and tries to run. He meets her from the other side and attempts to kiss her. She continues to resist him until finally he shoves her against a railing and leaves, throwing her purse out onto the road. The contents fall out and Belle goes to retrieve them.Stephen drives up at that moment and just misses hitting her. She begins picking up her things from the road as he stops and gets out. He accuses her of almost causing a wreck and she tells him that he is drunk. They are almost hit by another car as she tries to collect her things. He asks what she is doing and she tells him she is trying to get to Greenwood Station. When he offers her a lift, she sarcastically suggests not in his condition. He goes to leave, then stops and tells her to get in. They drive on in the rain.She refuses a drink from his whiskey bottle and tries to dry her hair. He says wasn't she at the Roadhouse? She tells him she caught a ride but the fare was too high. He says she was asking for it trying to ride with drivers. Her car will take a couple days to fix and she can take care of herself, she tells him. She continues to comb and dry her hair.He asks how long does it take to boil an ostrich egg. Four hours. She looks at him as if he is crazy. He tells her he has a book about how to make friends and it says to say something. She smiles and turns on the radio. An announcer says the escaped maniac is being sought. She turns the dial elsewhere and Stephen starts talking about the crazy people at Greenwood.She tells him that he missed the turn and should go back. He says there is no place to turn around. She insists that he back up. Reluctantly, he backs to the intersection and turns on the crossroad.After some more chatter, they pull into the train station and Stephen offers to check the train schedule. She waits in the car as he walks around the building. Seeing officers across the tracks, he is hesitant to draw attention to himself. Meanwhile Belle finds an envelope under the dash of the car addressed to a Mr. Hargreaves. Inside are pamphlets on farm equipment. She looks through them and replaces them in the envelope under the dash.He returns to the car and tells her that she missed the train and that there will not be one the next day. He suggests they stay at a hotel in a town where he is going. She guesses that she has no other choice.She tells him that she grew up in Whickham and he says he knows it well, remembering the beach. This triggers a flashback from her childhood where she rode a horse up and down the beach while her parents waited. As she distracted her father from the backseat of their car, there was a terrible crash where they were killed. She tells Stephen she feels sick and he offers to stop. She says she feels better now.Coming to a railroad crossing, the bars come down and they stop while a fast train goes through. He confesses that he shouldn't be stopped because of drinking today on his birthday. When she says she is unsure if he is telling the truth, he assures her that he is. When she sees the train, she asks where the next stop is, and can they get there. He begins driving fast and is chased by a police car, but loses it with another roadblock and some traffic. Finding a dirt road, they turn off and the cop goes on past.They park on the dirt road and she tells him she knows he lied about the train. He says he likes her and didn't want to lose her company. He says that she was talking about her uncle (Peter Jeffrey) that she went to live with in Whickham after her parents' death. In another flashback we see her riding a horse at her uncle's place. She tells Stephen she wants to visit Whickham to see where she grew up. He says he is a traveling salesman from Birmingham and that everyone has their problems. She asks about his, and he has a flashback showing when he and a girl went into a bedroom to make out at a party.Belle informs him that they are almost out of petrol, so they pull into a station. When no one comes out to wait on him, he blows the horn. He gets out and finds the office empty. Going around the side, he comes to the bathroom window and sees a girl (Nina Francis) changing clothes through a crack in the glass. Belle comes out and sees him looking in the window. When he sees her looking, he comes and confesses that he is unable to find anyone. At that moment the girl emerges from the bathroom and he asks for petrol. They walk to the pumps and Belle enters the bathroom. When she returns she notices Stephen and the girl being very chummy. He pays and Belle sits in the car. Stephen tells her he has to make a phone call and will be back soon.The girl is attacked from the point of view of the killer. When Stephen returns to the car, Belle is asleep. He apologizes for taking so long and they leave. The girl's bloodied body is shown on the floor, with papers strewn about.Belle asks Stephen what he sells and he makes her guess. When she suggests farm equipment, she pulls out the envelope and confesses that she peeped at it. He pretends and informs her that Mr. Hargreaves had the job before him.They stop to eat and Stephen gets two cups of coffee. As she is eating, two bikers enter (George Collis and Ralph Arliss) and ask her to save two chairs next to her. As a joke, one of them adds a cube of sugar to each of the coffees. Stephen removes the cubes and carries them to the table. He presents Belle with a new pack of cigarettes, then turns back for matches. He bumps into one of the bikers, spilling his drink. The biker gives him a dirty look.They drive off but are pursued by the bikers, who make it difficult to proceed. After some maneuvering Stephen rams the back tire of one of the bikes causing it to crash and burn. The other biker stops to see. Stephen drives on as Belle protests. He refuses to aid the biker and Belle tries to wrestle the steering wheel away from him. In the struggle she falls out of the car and he comes to a stop in a muddy field. He chases after her and they struggle more. When a passing car stops to ask if she needs help, Belle tells the two men everything is all right. They reluctantly leave.He asks Belle why she didn't give him up and says he will go back to check on the accident. She tells him it's too late now and the police will be after them. He takes a swig of whiskey and she knocks it away, saying his breath will get them in trouble. They get back in the car with Belle driving.As it gets dark outside, they see another roadblock ahead and Belle turns off on a side road. They park and she suggests they wait until morning. He says he should take her to a hotel in a nearby town. He doesn't want her involved if the biker is dead. She tells him he will need a witness. Puzzled, he asks why she changes her mind about him. You helped me, she tells him. He helps her lower the seat to sleep.As he watches her, he has a flashback where he is making love to his girlfriend (Juliet Aykroyd) unsuccessfully.

Getting back in the car, he takes off down the highway.Belle is seen shopping at a local store. Through the window she sees Stephen drive by but she is unable to stop him. He drives on, cursing her.Belle walks down a road with a bag of apples and spies a horse. She feeds the horse an apple, which triggers another flashback where she was feeding her uncle's horse. She overhears laughter and climbs up to the hayloft where she sees her uncle and a woman rolling in the hay. Upset, she spills the apples. Ironically, she also spills the apples in the present also, and begins picking them up from the roadway.A man, Malcolm Robarts (Sterling Hayden), drives up in a 1929 Cord and stops to help. He feigns an accent which she quickly detects is fake, but his enthusiasm impresses her to accept a ride with plans for dinner that evening.Stephen is seen at a gas station where a man is adding oil to his engine. Seeing the car pass with Belle and Robarts, he slams the hood and drives off with the attendant running after him.Stephen turns into a parking building, takes a ticket and parks on the top level. Belle and Robarts are seen at the Grand Pier, walking and talking. He tells her they should dine on his yacht where the chef is very good and looks through a telescope. When Belle takes a look, she sees only an old freighter. Nevertheless she is impressed with his efforts.Stephen walks to a shop where in the window he sees porno magazines, which causes a flashback where his girlfriend finds his porno mags and suggests that maybe whipping him will satisfy his needs. As he walks past the newspaper stand, the headline reads GREENWOOD ESCAPE-GIRL MURDERED AT FILLING STATION.At an abandoned carnival Robarts continues to try to woo Belle. She seems impressed. Meanwhile Stephen sees them at the edge of the pier. He runs over, calling to Belle. Recognizing that this is the young man Belle told him about, he helps her rejoin Stephen.Belle and Stephen bicker about the separation and she says she wants her coat from his car. They walk to the parking building.Meanwhile, Robarts buys a paper and sees the picture of the killer on it. He drives to the parking building and looks up. Stephen sees him and thinks he wants Belle. Robarts calls and points to him. She tells him that maybe the biker is dead and they are after him. Robarts drives into the parking building and Stephen and Belle drive down. They have to stop behind a couple of cars to pay their parking ticket but just manage to get away before Robarts can catch up.They get out on the road but soon see Robarts chasing after them. They manage to elude him on a crowded turn where Robarts runs off the road and crashes into a gate. Stephen believes they have lost him but Belle suggests they turn off the highway a different way. Meanwhile Robarts reaches a red phone booth and calls the police.She asks if Stephen is hungry and brings forward a square box which she offers as a birthday present to him. He seems touched and thanks her. She says he can open it later. They arrive at Whickham and are seen riding horses on the beach. Tying up the horses, they go into the Castle of Comfort and order two beers. As they are drinking, Stephen sees the young biker, who notices him. Setting down the beers, Stephen rushes Belle out, telling her they have to leave. When the biker goes outside, he doesn't see them or their car. He gets a glimpse of them riding away on horses just as the other biker comes out with his arm in a sling. Belle and Stephen return the horses to the stable where their car is parked and leave.Angry again, Stephen says he will take her back to her car. She tells him that it is too far and will not be ready until tomorrow. She suggests they stay in a hotel. He says he could use a bath and she agrees. This brings up another flashback where she was bathing and her uncle came in and saw her naked. He commented about having seen it all before and threw her a towel.Saying he needs to take some miles off the clock, Stephen speeds up just as they are passing a motorcycle cop (Roger Nott). The cop pursues them and they stop. Approaching the driver's window, the cop tells him to turn off the motor. He asks what happened to the car and cites a broken headlamp. Stephen tells him it was a bump and that he will have it fixed tomorrow. The officer asks for his license, but after stalling, he admits that he doesn't have it with him. Telling him to get it fixed tomorrow, the cop answers the question of a nearby hotel a few miles away.She agrees to stay at the hotel, taking any room they can. This triggers a daydream in which Belle strips down to black underwear and hose with garters. He imagines her calling his name and is returned by her doing so. She asks for a light and notices he is trembling.Going to the hotel desk, the clerk (Norman Tyrrell) says they are full. Asking for anything, he is told they have a fishing cabin available for ten pounds. Stephen signs the register as Mr. Jones. When he asks for the evening paper, the clerk reluctantly gives it to him.They drive a short distance to the cabin and Stephen gives the key to Belle, telling her he will park the car. She unlocks the door and goes inside. They both agree the place is nice. He asks if she will take a bath, to which she replies, after you.
He goes in to run water as she lights a cigarette and brings the paper into the bedroom. When he sees the paper, he comes out and says there is no hot water until morning. They agree to go on to bed in their clothes. He says he will take the couch and gets a blanket from a drawer. Goodnights are said and Stephen goes out and closes the door.Belle lies on the bed, triggering another flashback. This time her drunken uncle comes into her bedroom to put a necklace on her. He tries to force himself on her. Suddenly the door opens and Stephen comes in to return the bath towel to the bathroom. Saying goodnight again, he leaves and closes the door. She gets up and puts a chair in front of the door.Turning out the room lights, Stephen notices Belle walking around in the room as seen under the door. He goes to the keyhole and peeps through. She begins to undress but looks at the door. Sensing he might be looking, she covers the door with her coat. He notices a bullet hole in the wall. Getting a knife, he tries to make the opening larger. Looking through, he observes her undressing. She takes the paper and sees his picture next to a headline saying KILLER STRIKES AGAIN. She turns off the light so he can no longer see her.Stephen turns in on the couch and pulls the blanket over him. Meanwhile the cop arrives back at the station and sees the front of the paper. He exclaims and goes into action.Dressing again, Belle prepares to try to leave. Another flashback shows her uncle attacking her in bed again. She quickly returns to the present and tries to sneak out while Stephen is sleeping. She rummages through his coat pockets for the lighter. When she drops the coat, she goes back in the bedroom. Stephen gets up to get a cigarette but can't find his lighter. He knocks on her door. She gets into bed and pulls the covers up to appear to sleep. She kicks the paper off the bed onto the floor as he comes in. Finding the lighter in her room, he lights a cigarette. Picking up the paper on the floor, he goes out and closes her door.She gets up immediately and tries all the windows, which will not open. She sneaks out of the bedroom and picks up the paper from the floor. Not seeing Stephen, she opens the outside door and he is standing there. She closes and locks the door, which angers him. He begins calling her and beating on the door.Hearing the sound of broken glass, he goes around to the back and sees her running away through the woods. He follows, calling her. This triggers another flashback with her uncle still wrestling with her. She runs to the car and tries to start it. Stephen hears the car starting and runs to it. A police car pulls up to the hotel with siren on. Getting to the car, he looks inside and gets the paper from the dash. The full page is seen with her picture on the right, identifying her as the escaped killer. All at once she begins strangling him, mirroring how she strangled her uncle in a flashback. The paper shows his picture on the left, saying THIS MAN IS IN DANGER.The hotel clerk points the way for the police. As they arrive, Belle slowly exits the car trance-like. As they take her away, one cop looks in the blue car and finds Stephen dead. Belle imagines herself riding a horse on the beach as they prepare to take her in. She produces the square box meant for Stephen and opens it, telling them that it takes four hours to boil an ostrich egg. She takes out the egg and they drive off."

New York City policeman Ed Lacy (Don Murray) practices his Knights of Columbus speech as he shaves and gets into uniform in the precinct locker room. On patrol in their squad car, Ed, and his partner, Billings (Treat Williams), arrest a prostitute and her African-American pimp, and threaten several pedestrians who object.The next day, Ed leads a local rally for a conservative mayoral candidate, Kevin ""Enough Is Enough"" Reilly (George S. Irving), an Irish Catholic who, like Ed, stresses his ethnic and religious roots.Meanwhile, at a local theater, Rabbit Shazam (James Earl Jones) arrives with the opening-night crowd, gets his pre-paid ticket held under the name ""Ambassador Shazam"" at the box office, and takes his seat. A large, African-American man wearing an identifiable Muslim caftan, Rabbit looks out of place among the middle-class New Yorkers. His expressions show contempt for the avant-garde program featuring African, classical and rock music conducted by Sally Deveraux.Meanwhile, Ed and Billings stop at a market for snacks, and when an inebriated young African-American insults them, Ed gets angry and threatens to blow the young man's head off.Later, Rabbit grabs Sally (Diahan Williams) outside her basement apartment, puts a knife to her throat and forces her to let him in. Sally's neighbor, Mrs. Edna Broderick, sees them in the hallway but is not sure if Sally is in danger. Inside Sally's apartment, Rabbit ties her up, searches for valuables and smashes her furniture and valuable cello; all the while he recites poetry, mocks her middle-class pretensions, and speaks with a funny accent into her tape recorder. Forcing Sally to call her parents, Rabbit tells her father that if he wants to save Sally he must send a $10,000 money order to a Western Union office on Broadway. Next door, Edna finally telephones the police. Ed and Billings get the call.At Edna's apartment, Billings uses her phone to call for backup. Ed steps into the hall and sees Rabbit and Sally coming out of her apartment. When Ed pulls his gun, Rabbit presses his knife against Sally's throat and tells Ed to let them through, but Ed holds his ground. Hearing sirens outside, Rabbit drops his knife and turns to the wall, hands and legs outstretched. Ed kicks Rabbit's legs, and when Rabbit turns around, Ed shoots him twice in the chest. Sally screams as Rabbit's body falls on top of her. When Detective Buckley arrives, Ed tells him that Rabbit came at him with the knife.In the ensuing investigation, Assistant District Attorney Winston (Dick A. Williams), an African-American, asks Edna why she was suspicious of Rabbit and tries to get her to admit that she called because he was black. At the precinct headquarters, Buckley and his partner, Detective Baker, ask Sally if she knew Rabbit well, and if not, why did she seem so concerned about him? When Sally has a moment alone with Ed, she thanks him for saving her but asks if he had to shoot Rabbit. He replies that Rabbit might have killed her, and killed him too. Winston interrogates Sally, but she says she cannot remember what happened because she was on the floor and did not see the shooting. Afterward, as Sally leaves the station, Ed gives her a ride home and pleads his case. He tells her about a policeman who was recently stabbed to death, and says it is good that Rabbit is dead, because otherwise the city would have to pay for an expensive trial and Sally would be dragged into court and picked apart by a defense attorney. She replies that Rabbit did not rape her, so why would a lawyer probe her sexual history? Alone in her apartment, Sally picks up a crumpled Polaroid photograph of Rabbit's body that one of the police technicians dropped on the floor. Playing a tape of a Strauss waltz, she hears Rabbit cutting in with nonsense patter. Later, she goes to the morgue and views Rabbit's body.Meanwhile, Kevin Reilly, who had earlier seemed dismissive of Ed, sees the ""Hero Cop"" headline in the newspaper and decides to use Ed in his law-and-order campaign. He tells Ed he wants him on the platform at every speech and promises that he will put Ed in a ""key position"" in city government. When Sally sees Ed touted as a hero and possible political appointee on television, she goes to the station and tells Baker and Buckley that she wants to change her story. She admits that Rabbit dropped his knife before Ed shot him.Later, Ed celebrates with his friends at a bar when Billings arrives to tell him that Sally has accused him of murder. Ed attends Sally's next performance and, afterward, takes her to a nearby bar in an attempt to convince her to change her mind. He tells her that he has eighteen years on the force and six commendations. A waitress, Annie, tells Sally that Ed is a hero at the bar because five years earlier he stopped a man from stabbing a waitress and, after being cut himself, shot the man to death.Sally goes to the D.A.'s office the next day and tells Winston that Ed is a psychopath. Buckley and Baker walk her through the crime scene again. The coroner shows the two detectives Rabbit's X-rays, which show that the back of his legs suffered trauma. Seeing a new, incriminating headline about Ed in the morning paper, Reilly tells his campaign chief to ""cut him loose,"" and when Ed shows up at a television studio later that day, Reilly explains that he will use him later in the campaign, but not now. Angry, Ed threatens Sally at the grade school where she teaches, which prompts her to again complain to Winston. Captain Stark, Ed's commander, tells him to take a vacation, and when Ed protests, Stark puts him on temporary restriction.Though Ed takes his wife and daughter to the sea shore, he continues to stalk Sally from there. He hires a thug, Arco, to menace her, but Arco accidentally kills two pedestrians when he tries to run her down. Ed invites Arco to hide out at an abandoned farm outside of the city, and then kills him. He goes to Sally's school, knocks her unconscious, carries her to the farm, and ties her to her cello so that she cannot run. The moment Sally sees that Ed is distracted, she unties the ropes and rams the pointed stand on the bottom of her cello into Ed's chest. He chases Sally, shooting at her, but as he loses blood he becomes woozy. In a stable, she stumbles into Ed pointing a gun at her, but realizes that Ed has died from his wound."

He decides to head to Titan, Nevada to soak in the western atmosphere and to attend the classes in person, he not realizing that the university does not exist and that it is all a scam. In Titan, he, by chance, stumbles across Hollywood-based Tumbleweed Productions' latest filming locale, they who specialize in B-westerns.

Lewis is assisted in navigating through his Hollywood life primarily by two people: Howard Pike, the lead stock cowboy in Tumbleweed's movies, he who is also seen as an expert in all things culturally western; and ""Troutie"" - Miss Trout - Kessler's production manager, who is attracted to Lewis, and he to her.

Although Lewis registers for a correspondence course offered by the University of Titan in Nevada, he decides he will benefit more by studying on campus, where he can experience the ""real West."" After leaving his parents' farm, he takes a train to Titan, which turns out to be an isolated whistle stop. The ticket agent tells him that no university exists and that the correspondence school is merely several post office boxes that are checked once a week by two con men. Ignoring the agent's advice to return home, Lewis gets a ride into town and checks into a hotel that happens to be the con men's base of operations.During the night, one of the con men attempts to rob Lewis' room, but Lewis awakens and fights, then hastily packs his suitcase, jumps into the con men's car and drives off into the desert. When the car runs out of gas, Lewis grabs his suitcase, as well as a second case that he finds in the boot of the car, and starts walking. The con men retrieve their car, but finding their case missing, begin a search for Lewis.Unprepared for the desert heat, Lewis walks for hours, fantasizing that he is a stoic character in dire circumstances, until life imitates art and he is almost trampled by Howard Pike (Andy Griffith) and other gun slinging cowboys riding horses. The men, who are actors making a ""talking picture"" for a ""Poverty Row"" studio named Tumbleweed Production Company, take Lewis to their camp, where his sunburn and black eye are tended by Miss Trout (Blythe Danner), who is assistant to Kessler (Alan Arkin), the film director.When the troupe returns to Hollywood, Lewis accompanies them and takes a room in a local boardinghouse. Meanwhile, the con men arrive at the vacated shooting site and find a scrap of cardboard bearing the name of the Rio Café, a Hollywood restaurant that supplies the troupe's meals on location.In his boardinghouse room, Lewis continues to write stories, but soon returns to the production company office to ask for a job and Trout gives him an application to fill out. Overhearing them talk, Howard Pike sends Lewis to the Rio, where he is hired as a dishwasher. Not long after, Lewis is cast as an ""extra"" to work with Pike and his colleagues, Wally and Jackson.One day, when Kessler asks for a volunteer to do the risky stunt of jumping from a balcony onto the back of a horse, the veteran stuntmen feign reluctance, forcing Kessler to raise the fee he is willing to pay them. The experienced men continue to hesitate, but Lewis enthusiastically volunteers to do the stunt for no extra money. He accomplishes the task successfully but, afterward, suffers great pain while getting off the horse. Pike explains that when a special stunt is needed, Lewis should wait until enough money is offered to make it worth the risk; otherwise, Lewis will ruin the business and be disliked by his co-workers.Meanwhile, the con men suspect that the Rio is a clue to finding Lewis and proceed there. When Lewis sees them, he runs away before they can confront him. Back in his room, Lewis looks into the purloined case, where he discovers University of Titan stationery, a gun and a few thousand dollars in cash and money orders.Later, after Kessler fires an actor for demanding a raise, he replaces him with Lewis. Although Lewis' acting is at first wooden and unconvincing, he soon becomes so good that Kessler gives him a screen test. Trout, who grows attracted to Lewis, invites him to her home. Charmed that Lewis would rather be a writer than a star, she suggests that he talk to Pike, who, she reveals, is secretly paid by Kessler to help him create realistic cowboy characters.Lewis goes to Pike's apartment and tells him that he is a writer, but is pointedly informed that a person is a writer only when someone else says he is. Despite this rebuke, Pike agrees to look at Lewis's manuscript, which is titled Hearts of the West . Meanwhile, after seeing Lewis's screen test, Kessler decides to invest in him as an upcoming star. The Rio hangs Lewis' head shot on the wall next to photos of famous film cowboys. Among the photos is one of Lewis' heroes, former cowboy star, Billy Pueblo, who seems to have disappeared from the movies. When Lewis wonders aloud about what happened to Billy, Pike says wistfully that the actor became independently wealthy and bought a ranch. Knowing that Lewis will be negotiating with Kessler, Pike advises him not to accept anything less than $150 a week, and if Kessler refuses, to walk out of the room.However, when Lewis follows Howard's advice, Kessler fires him. Trout later explains to Lewis that even the star of the film does not earn that much money and that Pike is not financially savvy. When Lewis refuses to believe that Pike would mislead him, Trout explains that Pike used to known as Billy Pueblo, but his career declined. Trout arranges for Lewis to meet Eddie Polo, a film director and brother-in-law of A. J. Nietz (Donald Pleasence), a major pulp fiction publisher. When Polo is unwilling to introduce Lewis to Nietz, Lewis offers to raise $2,000 for the director's special film project.Using Titan stationary to write a letter of introduction, Lewis proceeds to a bank, opens an account and cashes the con men's money orders. After Lewis presents the $2,000, Polo directs Lewis to visit Nietz's seaside mansion. There, Nietz agrees to look at Lewis' manuscript and a few days later, invites him back for brunch. A lively party is in progress when Lewis arrives, but Nietz takes him aside to meet with Pike, who has submitted ""Hearts of the West"" to Nietz for publication under his own name. Pike explains that alimony payments and other bills made him desperate, but Lewis, hurt that his role model would stoop to plagiarism, refuses to listen and tells him that Billy Pueblo stood for something positive.Returning to Hollywood, Lewis discovers that the con men have searched his room and are waiting in their car in front of his boardinghouse. Lewis sneaks to Trout's apartment, but, finding Kessler there, presumes she is romantically involved with him and leaves. Trout searches for Lewis, unaware that the con men are following her.At the Rio, where Kessler, Pike and the rest of the production crew are holding a stag party in a back room, Trout learns that Lewis is at the apartment of a friend and proceeds there. Shortly after she arrives, the con men burst into the apartment and hold them at gunpoint, as they search for the money. In an unsuccessful attempt to confront them, Lewis is shot twice. Unexpectedly, Pike, ready to make amends for betraying Lewis, enters and, armed with a six-shooter, forces the con men into the closet to wait for the police.Later, as Lewis is being placed into an ambulance, he suggests to Pike that a story of their experience might make enough money to fulfill Pike's dream of independent wealth. However, the former cowboy star plans for Lewis to get the glory. As the con men are led to a paddy wagon to take them away to jail, they ask Pike the identity of ""the kid."" Pike answers, ""Lewis Tater, a writer."" While Lewis is driven away in the ambulance, he continues to create a story in his head."

Lies My Father Told Me,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073293/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Jewish boy grows up in 1920s Montreal with a grandfather who tells stories and a father who won't work. It's the 1920's. The Hermans - Harry Herman, his wife Annie Herman née Elias, their six-year-old son David Herman, and Annie's father - are a Jewish family living in a small flat in the working class Jewish neighborhood of Montréal (in Canada). David loves his ""Zaida"" (grandfather) with who he spends most Sundays driving around in their horse drawn wagon collecting junk - namely ""rags, clothes, bottles"" - to earn money. David also loves hearing his Zaida's stories about their Jewish culture, although most of those stories are made up and not based based on religious Jewish beliefs. Those stories are only one bone of contention between religious Zaida and secular Harry, as modern thinking Harry feels the stories are old fashioned hogwash and provide David with no grounding in what is real in life. Another issue of contention is money, as Harry is always dreaming of get rich schemes - the latest being to manufacture permanently creased and thus iron-less trousers - for which Zaida will not provide unconditional funding. And a third issue is Zaida's aging horse Ferdeleh, which Harry believes would be better put to sleep. Usually, David, who is at the stage in his life where he takes most things literally, sides with his Zaida, and considers his father a liar. Caught in the middle is Annie. How to handle David becomes a larger issue when two of the most natural of events occur within their family.—Huggo The film opens with five-year-old David (Jeff Lynas) calling for his grandfather (Yossi Yadin), who makes a living buying and selling ""rags, clothes, bottles"" with his faithful horse, Freydleh, pulling his wagon.

His mother, Annie (Marylin Lightstone) is pregnant. Harry is always trying to persuade Annie's brother Benny (Henry Gamer) to invest in his schemes, and pressures Zaideh to loan him startup capital. But Zaideh is skeptical of his ne'er-do-well son-in-law, and is content to earn a slow yet steady living and observe the Torah. Harry disparages the old man and his old world ways, but David adores his Zeideh and their outings, and loves caring for Freydleh.One Sunday after Harry's latest scheme has failed, he announces that he's taking David fishing. David balks, as he had looked forward all week to joining Zeideh on his rounds. But in the end, Harry wins out. They taking fishing gear with them to cover for the fact that actually Harry leaves David in the front of a soda shop and goes in the back to bet on horses. After he wins, he instructs David to tell his mother that they went fishing.As the story progresses, Harry gets more abusive with each failed scheme. When Annie gives birth, David is jealous of her attention going to his new baby brother, and he acts out by carrying out Zeideh's idea of putting horse manure on the steps of Mrs. Tannenbaum (Barbara Chilcot), an unpleasant neighbor who is constantly screaming at Zeideh to move Freydleh away, as she can't stand the odor. When Mrs. Tannenbaum comes over to report the manure on her steps, Harry starts to beat David. Zeideh leaps to David's rescue, telling Harry never to touch the boy again ""...or I'll kill you"", and telling Harry never to ask him for another penny. Zeideh tells David that as long as he lives in that house, no one will ever hurt him again.One Sunday, David gets up as usual to feed Freydleh and get ready to go on rounds with Zeideh, but Zeideh's not in the stable; he's in bed with pneumonia. The doctor instructs Annie to send David to stay with her brother Benny so that he doesn't catch pneumonia, and so that Zeideh can rest. A week later, when David returns, Zeideh has died. When David goes to the stable to look for Freydleh, the horse is gone and the stable has been converted into an antique shop and Harry has bought a motor car.The film ends as it had opened, with David running wildly through the neighborhood calling for Zeideh, and we hear Zeideh's call: ""rags, clothes, bottles... rags, clothes, bottles""."

Jesse and J.B. arrive and talk Colby out of beating Johnny to death and the young Indian is taken to jail where Jesse berates him for being stupid enough to walk into an ambush. When Johnny blames June for Colby harassing him, Jesse informs him that June discovered she was pregnant with Johnny's child right after he left for Vietnam; however, she had a miscarriage. She wrote Johnny, but Colby intercepted her letters and destroyed them. Believing Johnny had abandoned her, June then became an alcoholic. Johnny asks Jesse if he knows all this, why is the sheriff charging him with attempted rape? Jesse confesses he was dishonorably discharged from the army for being a homosexual, and Colby is blackmailing him with that knowledge. When Johnny threatens to tell Jesse's secret, the sheriff snarls that in this town, the only thing lower than a Indian is a homosexual.Later, a drunken White Eagle comes to the jail and promises to talk to Colby, chief to chief, but Johnny sends him away. White Eagle goes home, dresses in the vestments of his office, including a war bonnet, and goes to the bar to talk to Colby. When White Eagle threatens to call a war council against the town, Colby orders Newt and his men to hang the old man. As Johnny watches from the jail, Colby and his men place a noose around White Eagle's neck, tie the other end to a tree, and stand the old man on the back of a pickup truck. When White Eagle refuses to beg for mercy, Colby tells Newt to drive the pickup truck back and forth to scare him. J.B. comes out and demands that they stop, but Newt only takes orders from Colby. J.B. reaches into the cab for the trucks keys and Newt's foot slips off the brake, leaving White Eagle dangling in the air.Later, Johnny asks J.B. why no one was arrested, and is told that Colby insists the incident be reported as an accident. Johnny thanks him for trying to stop the hanging, but when he shakes J.B.'s hand, he slams it against the bars, knocks him unconscious, and escapes.That night, Jesse and J. B. go to the reservation school to ask Nenya if they have seen Johnny. As soon as they leave, Wade, Newt and the rest of Colby's men show up and rape Nenya to make her talk. Meanwhile, Johnny places White Eagle's body on a traditional burial scaffold, then goes to the school just as Colby's men leave in a pickup trunk. He finds Nenya bleeding on the floor and as she dies, she tells Johnny she loves him. At this point, Johnny becomes determined to get revenge against Colby and his men the only way he knows: through vigilante justice.In the morning, Johnny finds Ned and scalps him, leaving him to walk away to a local church where he drops dead in front of the horrified parishioners. As a result of this, Colby orders Jesse and J.B. to hunt Johnny down and kill him.The following day, Johnny discovers Wade fixing a fence, ties him down with barbwire and places a burlap bag full of live rattlesnakes on his head and leaves him to die.Another day later, Johnny kills one of Nenya's rapists with a tomahawk and knocks the second one unconscious with a board. When the second man revives, he discovers he is tied up with sticks of dynamite strapped to him. Johnny lights the fuse and tells the man he has two minutes to think about Nenya. Johnny runs away and the man blows up to pieces.Although Jesse wants to call in the state police to hunt Johnny, Colby refuses, frightened that outsiders may look askance at the murder of White Eagle.A few days later, Johnny finds Newt at home watching a western movie on television. Johnny takes him to the desert, and buries him up to his chin before gouging out his eyes and leaves him for dead.Next, Johnny finally ambushes Colby in his barn, puts a noose around his neck, strings him up and whips him. But an armed ranch hand enters and Johnny flees before he can finish killing Colby.In the house as June tends to Colby's wounds, she blames him for the loss of her baby, but Colby is happy the half-breed died. June throws a drink in his face and he backhands her. They are interrupted when Jesse and J.B. arrive. After J.B. takes June from the room, Colby threatens that unless Jesse kills Johnny, he will tell the town about Jesse's lace discharge. As the policemen leave, June asks them for a ride out of town.After dropping June off at the local bus station, Jesse leaves J.B. behind, and goes to track Johnny through the desert. When the sheriff finally corners him, Johnny refuses to surrender and convinces Jesse that the only way he can be free is to forgive himself and do what is right. Jesse gives Johnny provisions and allows him to leave. Before going, Johnny asks if it is all over and Jesse replies it is for Johnny, but it is only the beginning for him."

Using songs based on the original works of Gilbert and Sullivan (but updated with modern lyrics), this film was created to commemorate the centenary anniversary of the first collaboration of the composers of the Savoy Operas.—Rhino <rhino@blueyonder.co.uk> ""Dick Deadeye"" Or ""Duty Done""This is an animated cartoon designed by Ronald Searle and directed by Bill Mendelez based upon a pastiche-compilation of several Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, being 'HMS Pinafore' (HMP), 'Iolanthe' (Io), 'The Mikado' (M), 'Patience' (P), 'The Pirates of Penzance' (PoP), 'Ruddigore' (R), 'The Sorcerer' (S), 'Trial by Jury' (TbJ), and 'Utopia Limited' (ULtd). The words and music are both adapted from the originals by Robin Miller and Leo Rost. The voice actors are credited.Able Seaman Dick Deadeye (Victor Spinetti: HMP) is commissioned by Queen Victoria to regain the ""Ultimate Secret"" (U.S.) which has been stolen by the Sorcerer (Peter Reeves: S) and his reptilian sidekick, the Shameleon, and which is being offered by them to The Pirate King (George Cooper, sung Ian Samwell: PoP).Dick spots the Sorcerer and the King conferring at a military parade ('Entrance of the Peers'; 'Bow, bow ye lower middle classes': Io), where also good Japanese Nanki (John Newton, sung Casey Kelly: M) spots his evil identical twin brother Poo (also John Newton / Casey Kelly: M) pick-pocketing the crowd. Dick hurries to the military H.Q., the Hexagon, to find help ('Here's a how-dee-do': M) where he meets the Captain (Peter Reeves: HMP) and they both go to see The Major-General (Francis Ghent, sung John Baldry: PoP: 'I am the very model of a modern major general': PoP) who also charges Dick with the recovery of the U.S..Dick hurries to the pirates' hang-out, ""The Queen's Nose"", ('Oh, better far to live and die': PoP) where Rose Maybud (Julia McKenzie, sung Liza Strike: R), the barmaid, is on the lookout for ""a man of pure evil, so I can reform him"". She spots Dick ('Prithee, pretty maiden': P) but drops him when she finds he's good. The Sorcerer and Shameleon arrive ('My name is John Wellington Wells' (JWW): S: ""I counsel on etiquette / You'll eat spaghetti, yet"") and agree to sell the U.S. to the Pirate King in exchange for the (rather small) remaining pirate treasure. The Sorcerer goes to fetch the U.S., followed by Dick and some pirates, whom he eludes: and the Shameleon attracts a Cat as a lover.At the Sorcerer's shop (JWW: S reprise), Dick distracts the Sorcerer with a request for a potion to make him handsome ('Sprites of earth and air': S), and tries to steal the U.S., but it and the Shameleon are knocked out of the window into the basket of Little Buttercup (Miriam Karlin: HMP), a buxom ribbons-, bangles-, and marine-supplies-vendor in a low-cut purple-striped dress. The basket is stolen by Poo, and all give chase, including a posse of three policemen ('A policeman's lot is not a happy one': PoP), but they actually catch Nanki instead and drag him off to trial.At the Courts of Justice, the Judge (Barry Cryer: TbJ: 'All hail great Judge': 'Now, Jurymen, hear my advice', both TbJ) falls for Little Buttercup ('I'm called Little Buttercup': HMP) and having been bored with Nanki's evidence ('A wandering minstrel I': M; and 'I swear to tell the truth' based on 'When I go out of door': P) sends Nanki to the Tower of London for 200 years (""How guilty do you find the defendant?"" ""Very guilty!"" ""Very proper"".), before exiting the Court in triumph ('A Judge is he, and a good judge too': TbJ) with Little Buttercup.At the Tower of London, escorted by the Yeoman of the Guard (another G&S operetta: 'Farewell the world': HMP) Nanki muses on his lot and lost love, Yum-Yum (Linda Lewis, sung Beth Porter: M), whose spirit is trapped in Nanki's shamisen or guitar ('Just as the moon must have the sun', based on 'The sun whose rays': M) awaiting Nanki to become ""a whole man, to make me a whole woman"". Poo meets the Sorcerer outside the Tower and agrees to return the U.S. in return for becoming his apprentice to learn all his tricks. The pirates capture them and take then to ""The Queen's Neck"", where it is found that the U.S. is in code: all agree that it shall be deciphered by the Sorcerer on board the pirate ship. Poo declares himself to be 'the most evil man in the world', the 'Terror of Titipu' - Rose decides to fall in love with him and reform him.Dick rushes back to the Hexagon to enlist aid: he finds the Rear-Admiral (Francis Ghent, sung John Baldry: HMP: 'I am the monarch of the sea', HMP) and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts, who promptly calls the Captain ('He remains an Englishman', HMP) and gives him command of the 'Pinafore', and also a permit to Dick to seek a crew amongst the condemned prisoners. Dick rushes to the Tower, to find Nanki entertaining the prisoners ('The flowers that bloom in the spring': M: Prisoner sung by Ian Samwell), where they almost all enlist.The pirates go on board their ship, together with the Sorcerer and Poo ('Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry': PoP); Rose Maybud sneaks aboard dressed as a pirate, and so does the Cat, which corners the Shameleon.The Captain is taken by the dignitaries (Judge, Major-General, Rear-Admiral 'When I was a lad': HMP) to the 'Pinafore', his first command ('We sail the ocean blue' and 'I am the Captain of the 'Pinafore'': both HMP), and indeed the first time he's been to sea. Little Buttercup outfits the crew, and the rats leave the ship.The 'Pinafore' gives chase to the pirate ship, aided by a couple of giant cherubs ('Go, ye heroes': PoP) - and Poo takes advantage of the ocean-motion (and a garlic sausage, mussels, butterscotch, bacon and cream pizza) to make the Sorcerer sick and hand over the U.S. - but when they catch up the crews are more inclined to welcome old friends rather than fight. The Captain and Pirate King do fight, but the King's pants fall down revealing a strawberry birthmark on his backside. Little Buttercup then reveals ('Many years ago': HMP) that when she was a nursemaid she mixed up the infant Captain (recognizable by the birthmark) and Pirate King so they now change clothes and places. However, neither now has the U.S..Poo has however now escaped with the U.S., to the nearby island of Utopia, so the combined crews follow ('With cat-like tread': PoP), coming across the scantily-clad Regent of Utopia, the Princess Zara (Miriam Karlin?: ULtd) and her court of show-girls, with whom they sing the double chorus (female 'Hail, hail, and how-dee-do', based on 'Come friends who plough the sea': PoP; with male counter-chorus 'Land of sand and sea and sun' - this is not G&S but in the style of the ""Beach Boys""). Zara has captured Poo: the Sorcerer offers to execute him, and steals the U.S. back: pursued into a small pond by Dick and the Captain, it is discovered from the reflection that the U.S. is in mirror-writing, and is: ""It's love that makes the world go round"" ('Nothing venture, nothing win': HMP).With the secret out, Nanki and Poo become merged into one person ""man is composed of both good and evil"", and the spirit of Yum Yum (the missing Queen of Utopia - who else?) is released from Nanki-Poo's shamisen: the Sorcerer falls for Little Buttercup, and Dick and Rose Maybud are reunited. The U.S. being revealed world-wide, war and crime cease ('Here's a how-dee-do': M) and the dignitaries arrive by hot-air balloon to start an idyllic existence with the island girls. The Shameleon and its lover the Cat steal the balloon, which floats off as the credits roll ('Entrance of the Peers', Io, reprise)."

It is a screen version of one of the most popular novels by Dimitar Dimov (190 -1966). The action takes place during the Civil War in Spain. The accidental meeting of British noblewoman Fanny Horn with Father Eredia, a Jesuit monk, reverses their destinies. The attraction between them is very strong, yet the monk is fanatically devoted to his faith. Influenced by his religious strength, Fanny Horn follows him to a place where a typhus outbreak is raging. Pena Ronda is a camp for typhoid patients. The conditions are horrible, and the death is creeping around them. The shadows of the terminally ill move silently amid the rusty barbed-wire fences and the hospital shacks while on the outside the people of Spain are being drowned in blood. Against the background of this inferno, a passionate crime is committed. It is the work of English aristocrat Fanny who is in love with her victim-priest Eredia. There are many reasons for this personal drama: the burning tears of the Revolution, the chimera of death haunting the place and, above all, the degradation of the priest who has turned from an inspired idealist into a fanatical lunatic. Befuddled by the sterile canons of his religion, Eredia sinks into the hermetic world of his lunacy and is humiliatingly detached from the sufferings of ordinary people and his own nation. Exhausted by her experiences, Fanny starts taking morphine.—Georgi Djulgerov <georgidjul1943@gmail.com>"

The Swordsman,1975,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072238/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Harriet Zapper is hired to find the identity of Karel Duval, and the true heir to the Duval family fortune, a bloody trail of murders leads the Big Zapper to the South of France and into a hornet's nest of betrayal and death. Two men drive in their Rolls Royces through a a narrow road in the middle of a rural English plain, each in the company of a driver and a companion in tuxedos. They stop at a lonely place obviously set up in advance, and the men compliment each others with short and dagger they had brought in the boxes of their cars. Then, followed only by the two witnesses, they walk further away from the road. They fight a duel, and the man in a black shirt wins first blood on the blond man in a red shirt. The man in black keeps dominating the fight, and inflicts a couple more wounds on his opponent - until he has him at his mercy. The blond man demands grace, and promises never to visit France again in exchange for having his life spared.Renaud Duval (ALAN LAKE) reproaches his son Christian Duval (Noel Johnson) - the man in black - for his continuing pursuit of silly duels, and says that he hopes him to help with the education of his brother, Karel (JASON KEMP). Renaud then asks him to sign a testament in favor of Guy Champion (EDINA RONAY), a young blonde assistant and Renaud's lover. As the older man refuses, he menaces him with his foil, and the man ends up signing the document. Next, Renaud kills his father, and takes the family medallion from him, to place it around his own neck.He signs Zendor with the man's blood on a piece of paper, with the typed message, «Revenge is sweet. Your young brother Karel is next.» Then, he impales the piece of paper in his foil, and again skewers his late father with it. He waits the boy to come from college to give him the news, and tell him that Karel is an adopted son, and that all the manor's estate was left only to Renaud. Renaud shows how charitable he is by promising to take care of him for life, and tells the boy he had been found on the street, so he has no idea who his real father was.Meanwhile, Harriet Zapper, private eye (LINDA MARLOWE), is at home waiting for someone to need her services. She is in the company of Hock (TONY THEN), a kung fu maniac. They are interrupted by Karel, who wants to hire her services to search for his real father.Guy Champion is actually a cross-bow champion, able to place six bolts in the center of a target. Her next target is Karel, when the boy is rowing alone in a river next to his college. He falls on the river with the impact of the bolt, but is able to shout for help - and by chance, there was a blonde girl around to save him.Karel meets with Zapper again, and this time, he tells the details of his father's murder - slashed by Alex Zendor, a friend of his brother.Zendor practices his fencing with Guy, and shows his expertise disarming her first, stripping her nude with a single thrust of the foil, and then cutting part of her hairs that cover her sex. She's thrilled by his action.
Renaud presses his brother to duel with him - giving a foil to Karel, and using a heavier sword himself. The duel is interrupted by Zapper, who wants to interview Renaud. The boy claims to be tired, and wants to stop, but Renaud cuts off a bit of blonde hair and presses on. He seems about to impale the boy, when Zapper reaches him. Renaud shows his ability by lighting a match with a slash of his sword, when she was going to smoke.She lives the manor house with Karel, with the false pretext that her car is not alright, and on her way she stops at a road side bar. She passes a phone call to Claude, asking him to meet there immediately, hiring his services to be bodyguard to Karel while she goes to France in her quest for the truth. Waiting for her, Karel is entertained by five dancers lightly dressed, on a rehearsal conducted by the Compere. Next, she hires a Bar-fly (Graham Ashley) for a strange scene - and acts out a false sexual harassment scene, just in time for Karel to be seen punching the Bar-Fly by a Detective and a Bobby, who arrest the boy, accused by Zapper of molesting her - thus putting Karel away from his brother's reach.In a gym, Zapper is menaced by six bodybuilders (Bob Prowse, Bruce Ferguson, Colin Osborne, Howard Nelson, Terry Mundy, Chris Roberts), and one of them punches her face until she is KO. Her Chinese side-kick Hock, whom she had given the address of the gym, arrives then, and knocks all of them out with kung fu, starting with the bigger man (Howard Nelson) who had beaten Zapper.Revived, Zapper goes straight to the airport with Hock, and leaves him behind to pursue the inquiry on Renaud, as she goes to the south of France to search the birth registrars. However, since she rents a car at Nice's airport, she is followed by Guy Champion on another small white car. Zapper heads to Canne's city hall, where she is received by a Gendarme (Michael O'Malley) - more interested in eating a baguette over 1 meter long than in attending to her - and Inspector Cook (William Ridoutt) - who chooses to clean up his pistol while talking with her at the hall. She is informed that the register of Antibes she wanted to consult is at the city hall of Cannes or rather, it was, because it was burned down in a fire that very morning. The Inspector is useful for finding her the whereabouts of a man named Rabellais... by looking it up at the telephone directory book. He lives in a yacht - where apparently he has a fixed telephone line...Zapper drives to Cannes, but just after the junction to the La Tour de l'Esquillon hotel restaurant, she has to stop to ask the way from a local by the road side. Guy takes the opportunity to run up a hillock - on high heels and mini skirt - adjust her bow and throw a bolt at Zapper's neck. Just as Zapper turned round, thanking the man, got in the car and road on - not noticing that the man had taken the dart right in his chest, and was falling dead on the road.Hock enlists Renaud's fencing school, and pays with blood his poor defense, as Renaud takes pleasure in seeing the blood squish from his opponent's bodies.Zapper locates Rabellais (Peter Halliday) easily, and in a promenade along the Bay of Cannes, Rabellais informs her that Karel is the only son of the deceased Duval, Renaud being actually a child he had taken from the streets, and adopted.For no apparent reason, Guy makes a phone call to Renaud to tell him that her attempt on Zapper's life had failed; this has two effects, enraging him, and stopping him from further injuring Hock with his sword.Zapper decides to stop her car and go for a swim, taking her revolver with her wrapped in a plastic bag. She is being followed by Guy (EDINA RONAY), in mini skirt and boots, who strides into the water in pursuit, firing crossbow bolts at her. Zapper keeps diving underwater to dodge the bolts, much to Guy's frustration. Then Zapper suddenly leaps back up again close to Guy, with a gun in her hand. Guy looks shocked, then Harriet pumps several bullets into her, and Guy falls backwards with a moan into the sea, where her corpse floats in the wavelets.Next morning, Zapper visits Rabellais at his mansion overlooking the sea. He gives her a letter by Duval, reading: «The map attached to this note reveals the whereabouts of a small box that I will bury on my estate in England. I will leave in this box the answer to my true will and testament and all the documents relating to my two children together with a key that will open my safety deposit box in the Bank of England.» The drawn map has its own explanation: «North six paces from urn towards tree turn then three paces turn three paces north».Zapper flies back to England, and meets Hock at home, where the young man is practicing with the foil alone, with no sign of injury on his right upper arm...
Zapper takes Karel out of jail and tells him the truth about his birth.Hock jumps the high wall to gain access to the manor house of Renaud. He tries to follow the instructions on the map, starting from a large decorative urn in the garden of the house. He finds easily the little box. As easily as Renaud finds him. He is forced to hand the paper in the box to Renaud, who reads it to himself: «Embedded in the stone of jade that I wear around my neck is the key to my safety deposit box containing all the documents to my sons and my final will and testament. (a) Christian Duval»Renaud eats the paper before Hock could read it. Then he forces Hock to a duel... ""to show what you're able to do,"" Renaud says.Zapper arrives at the mansion with Karel, but only after Renaud kills Hock with sadistic refinement. She starts talking to him inside the house - but then leaves the two brothers alone, as she wants to meet with Hock.The First Swordsman (Peter Wonson) warns Renaud that the Chinese man is dying in the garden, which he can't believe because he had left him for dead a minute before.Zapper leaves the house to go back to the garden, just in time to hear Hock's last words. She pick's Hock's foil and goes back to the house, but is surrounded by the six swordsmen, who take her on with rapiers. She wounds the First Swordsman, and kills three of them (James Hennessy, Michael O'Brien, E. Pollard), one by one.Meanwhile, Karel is able to run away from home, fencing for his life against Renaud, who injures him several times. Zapper is still occupied with the last two swordsmen (Frederick Marks, Bruce Lidington). Renaud is distracted by the First Swordsman, and while he finishes him again showing cruelty, he leaves Karel bleeding against the car box.At last, Zapper makes a double kill of the last two swordsmen. Then, Zapper takes on Renaud one-on-one with the naked foils. It's a humiliating defeat to the swordsman, who's tripping over his own feet as Harriett slices him to ribbons with ease.Karel pleads for his life, ""Don't kill him. He's my brother.""And Zapper hands him the little key to the bank's deposit box: ""This key is yours, Karel. You're the only son of Christian Duval.""""How is my brother?""""Don't worry about him."""
