Twelve months after winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and her partner Peeta Mellark must go on what is known as the Victor's Tour, wherein they visit all the districts, but before leaving, Katniss is visited by President Snow who fears that Katniss defied him a year ago during the games when she chose to die with Peeta. With both Katniss and Peeta declared the winners, it is fueling a possible uprising. He tells Katniss that while on tour she better try to make sure that she puts out the flames or else everyone she cares about will be in danger.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Katniss and Peeta's unprecedented co-victory in the 74th Hunger Games stirs an uprising. President Snow visits Katniss to threaten the lives of everyone she knows and holds dear if she doesn't do all she can to toe the line and quell the unrest. As her best efforts fail, Plutarch Heavensbee (a former games-master, now returned) meets with Snow to implement a Quarter Quell, by which to gather all former Hunger Games victors and have them eliminate each other. Katniss and Peeta end up in the Quarter Quell but must form alliances in order to survive; however, those with whom Katniss prefers to ally herself seem to be for emotional rather than tactical reasons.—statmanjeff After defying the Capitol on national television, Katniss has to attempt to control an uprising stirring in the districts. When President Snow puts her family and friends in jeopardy Katniss knows she has no choice but to follow Snow's orders. Then he turns Katniss and Peeta's world upside by throwing them back into the arena with other winning tributes and there will only be one winner. Katniss plans to sacrifice her own life to save Peeta's.—molly-field Six months after winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have resumed their life in the coal mining town in District 12. As part of their victory, they now have a luxurious house in the so-called Victor's Village, where Katniss lives with her mother and sister. On the day Katniss and Peeta are set to begin a victory tour of the country, President Coriolanus Snow visits her. He explains that her approach to ending the last Hunger Games, where she and Peeta attempted a suicide pact after learning they could not both survive, inspired rebellions in the districts. He orders that Katniss not only convince the entire country of her and Peeta's love as the reason for their actions, but convince Snow himself as well; if not, her loved ones will be killed, and District 12 will be destroyed, just as District 13 was during the uprising years ago.The first stop of the tour is in District 11, former home of Rue, Katniss' 12-year-old ally who was killed in the previous games. After Katniss and Peeta voice their personal thoughts regarding both the districts' fallen tributes, a man in the crowd whistles the tune Katniss and Rue shared to ensure each another of their safety, and makes the three-finger salute of District 12. Everyone follows the man's example until a peacekeeper shoots the man dead, leaving Katniss angry, afraid, and upset. Their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, informs Katniss and Peeta that they must display their relationship for the remainder of their lives.Katniss proposes a public engagement between herself and Peeta, which is carried out and celebrated at Snow's home in the Capitol. There, Katniss meets with the new Game-maker, Plutarch Heavensbee, who has specifically requested the position, in spite of his predecessor, Seneca Crane, ending up dead due to his inability to control the ending of the previous Hunger Games. Upon returning to District 12, Katniss warns her close friend Gale Hawthorne of President Snow's threat to kill both their families.In the meantime, Heavensbee assists President Snow in his efforts to quell the uprising in the district. His strategy is to taint Katniss' public image, in an attempt to destroy her as symbol for the uprising. To that end, peacekeepers crack down in District 12, causing Gale to be publicly whipped after attacking newly placed Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. However, Katniss and Haymitch intervene, making them even stronger advocates for rebellion. That evening, Snow devises a different strategy; if Katniss refuses to play by his rules, he will get rid of her by other means. He announces Panem's third Quarter Quell, a version of the Hunger Games every 25 years that contains a special provision: all tributes are selected from the existing pool of victors. Since Katniss is the only surviving female victor of District 12, this means she is a tribute by default. She immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta becomes the Quarter Quell's victor, should he compete in the games.At the reaping, Katniss and Haymitch are reaped by chaperone Effie Trinket. However, Peeta volunteers to take Haymitch's place and is sent directly to the train with Katniss, and neither has a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones. This also cancels their wedding, which was supposed to take place the next day.Katniss and Peeta are taken to the capital city, ride the parade again, and are forced into training. They meet their fellow victors from the other districts. The two of them are immediately wanted as allies by the majority of the tributes, although some of them are old, weak, or ill-suited for the physical match. Still, she finds that some of them, while lacking in brute strength, may have valuable survival skills. During their individual evaluations, Peeta creates a drawing of a deceased Rue covered in flowers on the floor; an emotion-stricken Katniss creates a puppet in the likeness of Seneca Crane, and suspends it by its neck on the ceiling, as a warning to a stunned Heavensbee.During the personal interviews with Caesar Flickerman, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by President Snow. As a special effect, her designer Cinna has designed it to turn into a costume resembling a Mockingjay, which has become a symbol of silent protest against the Capitol. When it is time for Peeta's interview, he reveals (falsely) that Katniss is pregnant, which incites an overwhelming reaction from the public to cancel the games; however, President Snow orders that the games proceed anyway.Before entering the arena, as the pedestal rises, Katniss witnesses Thread and his men entering the room and beating Cinna to death, in punishment over his controversial dress design for Katniss. Katniss is devastated, but unable to stop them. She ends up in the arena, which is a tropical forest with a central saltwater lake and an island in the middle containing the Cornucopia.The games start in the usual chaotic way, with most tributes going for weapons at the Cornucopia, resulting in a lot of initial fatalities. Katniss and Peeta manage to survive the first wave of killings and hide inside the forest. Snow hopes that Katniss will kill and betray as many other tributes as possible to stay alive, and thereby make herself unpopular. However, as the games get underway, Katniss and Peeta ally with Finnick Odair and Mags, both from District 4. They find that the arena is a dome protected by electrical forcefields; Peeta nearly dies after hitting the field, but is resuscitated by Finnick. Later that night, they are attacked by a chemical weapon made up of a fog of painful poisonous gas. Mags sacrifices herself early on, allowing the others to escape. The remaining trio rests in the middle of the forest where they are attacked by mandrills. During the attack the woman from District 6, a camouflage expert and drug addict, sacrifices her life for Peeta. After they escape the mandrills and rest at the beach, they are met by District 3's intelligent tributes, Wiress and Beetee, and District 7's female tribute, the cunning Johanna Mason.Johanna tells about how her group was surprised by a rain of blood, causing them to become blinded, and one tribute getting killed by an electrical forcefield. The group subsequently witnesses a large flooding, killing an unknown tribute in one section on the other side of the jungle. Wiress discovers that the arena is designed like a clock and every hour a specific attack occurs in its designated section. The other group of tributes then launches a surprise attack, causing several deaths on both teams, including Wiress. Heavensbee causes the Cornucopia island to start spinning violently. The spinning causes the team to break apart. Finnick and Katniss make it to the jungle to be subsequently lured into the woods by screams from their respective girlfriend and sister; however, it appears that they are fooled by jabberjays, genetically engineered birds that mimic human voices. They then regroup with the others.Beetee suggests a plan to electrocute the two remaining tributes outside the alliance, District 2's Brutus and Enobaria, by connecting a wire to a tree that is struck by lightning at noon and midnight each day. Beetee secures the wire to the tree, and Katniss and Johanna are required to take the other end back to the beach. The plan fails when the wire snaps, cut by Brutus and Enobaria, who are ready to kill Katniss. However, Johanna suddenly attacks Katniss, but cuts the tracker out of her arm and smears blood on her neck. With Katniss appearing dead, Johanna lures the other tributes away. After recovering enough to track down Peeta, Katniss finds the rest missing and Beetee unconscious. Finnick approaches and Katniss draws her bow, no longer knowing who she can trust, but hesitates to shoot. The storm clouds swirl and the lightning bolt starts to form. She quickly attaches the remaining wire to an arrow and shoots it at the force field during the lightning strike. This causes a massive blackout in the dome and the arena to shut down. President Snow enters the game room demanding answers, only to find that the game is off the air and Heavensbee is gone.Due to the impact of the electric blast, Katniss is near unconsciousness, but witnesses the arena dome starting to crumble. In her last waking moment she notices an aircraft entering and picking her up.She awakens in an aircraft with an unconscious Beetee. Upon entering the cockpit she finds Haymitch, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, who reveals himself as an ally and a turncoat-rebel against Snow. Learning she is on her way to District 13, and Johanna and Peeta were taken away by the Capitol, she attempts to attack Haymitch for not fulfilling his promise of returning Peeta home safely. Plutarch sedates her and she awakens days later with Gale by her side, who informs that her family is safe but District 12 has been destroyed by a government airstrike."
Iron Man 3,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1300854/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Tony Stark's world is torn apart by a formidable terrorist called the Mandarin, he starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution. Marvel's ""Iron Man 3"" pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?—Jawadjee The events of Loki's attack on New York City has left Tony Stark a completely changed man. Now saddled with a severe case of insomnia and post traumatic stress disorder, Tony spends his sleepless nights the only way he knows how - coming up with new prototypes for the Iron Man suit. But now new events require that Tony suit up again. A villainous mad man known only as the Mandarin has staged a horrible attack on the Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, and is coming for Tony. An angry Tony wants to confront the Mandarin face to face, who proceeds to stage an attack on Tony's Malibu mansion and leaves him with absolutely nothing - no Pepper, no toys except for a defunct Iron Man prototype called the MK42, and he's stranded in the middle of Tennessee. Tony believes the attack on the Chinese Theater and an attack on a small town in Tennessee are related. As he puts the pieces together and tries to get the MK42 working, he discovers far more sinister forces at work greater than the Mandarin himself. But how does an event from Tony's past fit in with the events of the present?—halo1k In Malibu California, Tony Stark has insomnia and over 72 hours he develops the new prototype MK42 of the Iron Man armature. He also recalls events in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, when he had one night stand with the genetic scientist Maya Hansen that was researching a regenerative process and made fun of his fan Aldrich Killian on the New Year eve. There are explosions in Los Angeles and the terrorist Mandarin assumes the attempts broadcasting through television. When Tony's bodyguard and friend Happy Hogan is seriously wounded in an explosion, Tony Stark challenges Mandarin and gives his address to him. However, three helicopters attack his mansion and he loses everything but his prototype, and he awakes in the Tennessee. Tony tries to make work the defective prototype and soon he discovers that the event from 1999 is connected to the present terrorist attacks.—ahmetkozan After saving New York from an alien invasion, billionaire Tony Stark buries himself deeper into his work by building a ton of new and improved Iron Man suits. He also starts having constant nightmares and doesn't know why. But deep in the shadows, a new menace called the Mandarin starts orchestrating a series of terrorist attacks all over the world. When his home is demolished and his suits are destroyed, Stark begins a personal journey to finding out the truth about the bombings and tracking down whoever is truly responsible. Little does Stark know however is that someone else from his past has his own plans against him and proves to be even more powerful than Stark realizes.—Blazer346 The movie opens with Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) narrating a story about how we create our own demons. In a flashback to New Year's Eve 1999, Tony meets a botanical scientist named Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) in Bern, Switzerland, and arrogantly avoids crippled nerdy scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who wants Tony's backing in his endeavor, Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM). Maya has an experimental plant. Maya has been working on experimental (and in some cases unethical) biological research in plants that causes their DNA to change drastically and has the power to cure incurable diseases and paralysis.In December 2012, it has been quite sometime after the events of New York City and the Avengers Initiative (from 'The Avengers') when Iron Man/Tony Stark saved New York. A haunted Tony Stark has obsessively built several Iron Man suits in his mansion. Tony works on a new model, the Mark 42, which is modular; all the suit pieces fly to him and recombine. The first attempt at making the MK42 work is met with a funk version of ""Jingle Bells"" with Tony dancing while the pieces are coming at him. As per the course, Tony of course completely ignores any safety measures that JARVIS takes. It ends rather poorly when Tony is thrown across the room attempting flight with the MK42 and it shatters into pieces. JARVIS of course gloats with an ""I told you so"" moment.Tony then continues his story about creating demons. He then talks about how he turned on the TV to find a new terrorist at work called ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley). The Mandarin hijacks American airwaves and makes his American debut by taking credit for the bombing of a US military station in Kuwait that killed the wives and children of soldiers out on maneuvers. President Ellis's initial response to the Mandarin however makes him the butt of the jokes of late-night talk show hosts: It seems the only thing that he's able to come up with is to take the MK8, the suit worn by Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and formerly known as ""War Machine"" and have it repainted, re-branded, and reintroduced as ""The Iron Patriot"".Tony later asks Rhodes in a restaurant what's really going on with the Mandarin. Rhodes tells Tony that while the media and the press only know of three bombings attributed to the Mandarin, there have been at least six more that have taken place off the books. Rhodes explains that he's now operating MK8 as the ""Iron Patriot"" (formerly known as War Machine). While the two are coming to an agreement that the name chosen was horrible, Tony is confronted by a group of kids who want his autograph. Tony jokes that the boy looks very much like Ralphie from A Christmas Story. The girl asks how Tony was able to escape the wormhole in New York, causing him to freak out. Tony makes a B-line for his Iron Man suit and enters, JARVIS explains that Tony is suffering a massive anxiety attack.Back at Stark Industries, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) goes to meet her 4:00 appointment. The appointment is with Aldrich Killian, who has improved his condition; he's in much better physical shape and his disability seems to be completely gone. Aldrich wants Stark Industries' backing in his think tank called ""Advanced Idea Mechanics"". AIM's goal is a biological experiment called ""Extremis"" which harnesses the brain's power to alter human DNA. He then shows Pepper a large holographic reconstruction of his brain and how Extremis can utilize parts of the brain that would otherwise go unused. Pepper tells Aldrich that Stark Industries isn't interested in funding AIM because the ideas could be translated into human weapons.Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) has found a new career as the head of security at Stark Industries although he's annoying nearly 99% of the company's personnel and visitors with his penchant for requiring everybody to wear badges. Pepper explains that complaints against him have risen nearly 200% since he started working there (which Happy takes as a compliment).Pepper drives home and Tony has a huge stuffed bunny for her as her Christmas gift. However, he is busy working and Pepper isn't greeted by Tony, but by another remote-controlled prototype of the Iron Man suit, leaving Pepper upset. Tony has developed a heads-up display (HUD) and is using it as a remote control. That night while asleep, Tony experiences PTSD-induced trauma about what happened in New York. They're then startled when one of the new prototype Iron Man suits is awakened and has made its' way into the bedroom. Tony then immediately dismantles it. A frustrated Pepper tells Tony that she's going to sleep downstairs and has him ""tinker with that"" after he explains to Pepper that he's been a complete mess since the events in New York and has been unable to sleep.The next day Happy follows one of Killian's men, Eric Savin (James Badge Dale), to the Grauman's Chinese Theater. Savin gives another man, Jack Taggart, a briefcase. Happy tries to intercede but is beaten senseless by Savin, and seconds later, Taggart overheats and explodes, leaving behind only his old dog tags. Happy is severely injured, while Savin walks away. Hours later, the Mandarin hijacks the TV airwaves to take responsibility for the blast.Tony is now furious over Happy, who has been left comatose by the bombing. After visiting the hospital to check on Happy, and to make sure that all of the hospital employees were wearing badges while in Happy's room (not to mention make sure that the TV is playingDownton Abbey (2010), Happy's favorite show), Tony is mobbed by reporters. One of them blatantly asks if Tony is going to kill this guy. A frustrated Tony then asks the reporters if that's what they really want, then issues his threat to the Mandarin saying that he just died and gives his home address on TV, egging on the Mandarin to carry out an attack on his home and that he'll be ready. Tony then angrily destroys the reporter's tape recorder and tells the mob of reporters to bill him.While at home, Tony has JARVIS bring up a hologram diagram of the destruction at Grauman's Chinese Theater. While JARVIS is analyzing the attack, Tony discovers that Happy is pointing to a curious oddity of military dog tags with the name ""Jack Taggart"" etched onto them. Since there was no active military personnel at the blast, Tony wonders exactly what the dog tags are doing there. JARVIS then analyzes the latest Mandarin attack and compares it with past incidents. This blast at the theater bears resemblance to an incident that happened four years ago in Rose Hill, Tennessee, and predates any known Mandarin attack, where an ex-army soldier named Chad Davis blew himself up, taking five people with him. Tony asks JARVIS if he's ever been to Tennessee. JARVIS then creates a flight path for the Iron Man suit.He's interrupted when the doorbell rings. A paranoid Tony wonders why he's getting visitors since he told JARVIS that the house is on complete and total lockdown. The visitor turns out not to be the Mandarin, but Dr. Maya Hansen, who believes Tony is in danger. A freaked-out Pepper is arguing with Maya and just as that's happening, the house is attacked by three helicopter gunships disguised as news choppers. Tony commands the MK42 suit to cover and protect Pepper. Pepper and Maya survive the attack. Tony gets the MK42 back and manages to destroy two of the helicopters, but down on power, he cannot fly. The house crumbles into the sea, taking Tony with it. The suit regains some power and flies off, unseen. Tony passes out.Sometime later, Tony awakens in the suit when JARVIS sets off the low battery alarm. He then sees he's plummeting towards the ground and crashes into a snowy forest at full speed. Initially, he thinks he's in Northern California, but JARVIS informs him that he's actually five miles outside of Rose Hill, Tennessee. Tony is exasperated, but JARVIS reminds him that he asked for a flight plan to be made. With no more power, JARVIS shuts itself down.Tony trudges through the snow, dragging the MK42 along with him. He stops at a gas station, where he uses a payphone to call Pepper, then steals a Poncho off a cigar store mannequin.Tony then drags the MK42 to a seemingly empty house nearby. Inside, he immediately begins work on repairing the MK42. But the house isn't empty. It's occupied by a lonely 10-year-old kid named Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins), who is stunned to find Tony working in his garage. Tony asks Harley for some help and promises that he'll be rewarded later on if he gets the help he needs. Harley tells Tony that the world thinks he's dead after the attack on his mansion. Tony calls himself ""The Mechanic"" and Harley asks Tony one question too many about the events in New York City, causing Tony to have another anxiety attack.Back at the remains of Tony's destroyed Malibu mansion, Pepper is searching for any clues to find out whether or not Tony's still alive. Thankfully she is able to retrieve a voice message left from Tony recorded after the attack that proves that he is alive. A relieved Pepper then seeks answers. Tony, working with Harley, assumes that Harley is being bullied at school because Harley keeps making harmless weapons to defend himself with, like a potato gun. Tony finally manages to get JARVIS back online thanks to a HUD display that he developed several months prior to the bombing.Teaming with Harley, Tony investigates the remains of the Mandarin-esque suicide bombing. Harley tells Tony about all the rumors surrounding the attack and the ""soldier"" in question. Tony notices that there are five shadows on a concrete wall, from the five victims who were killed along with Chad Davis.Tony then meets with Davis's mother at a bar, where he notices she's expecting someone and has a file on hand. He is about to ask her more questions when one of Killian's agents, Ellen Brandt, shows up and suddenly cuffs Tony. She poses as a Homeland Security agent to explain her actions to the sheriff, but when he starts asking her for identification, she shoots him. Tony manages to escape the bar, only to be cornered by Savin. He manages to defeat Brandt by luring her into a room where he's opened a gas line, and heats up Davis's dog tags in a microwave. The explosion throws Brandt into a telephone line and electrocutes her. Savin tries to take Harley hostage, but Harley overpowers him, allowing Tony to grab his car keys and escape.Tony drives off in Savin's car. While he drives, the Mandarin hijacks the airwaves once more and explains that he's going to brutally murder the CEO of a major oil company on live television if the president doesn't contact them within a specific time frame. Despite the President making the phone call, the Mandarin carries out the shooting, warning that the President is his next target.Tony calls Rhodes, who has managed to locate what they think is the Mandarin. Rhodes takes his suit to the Middle East. There, he is shocked to find nothing but an abandoned warehouse which doesn't have a single trace of the Mandarin. He also finds that the file he got in Rose Hill is a document from Advanced Idea Mechanics, Killian's company.Back in Tennessee, Tony drives to a nearby beauty pageant and sneaks into one of the camera crew vans so he can research the data on the documents he's found. Fortunately for Tony, the van is being operated by one of Tony's biggest fans, who even goes so far as to have Iron Man's likeness tattooed on his arm - though rather unrecognizable. Tony hacks into AIM's servers and finds video footage that sheds new light on what is going on: the bombs are the work of soldiers from the Extremis program, an experimental treatment intended to allow its users to recover from crippling injuries like amputations. However, if a user's body cannot properly metabolize Extremis, the user's body heats to an extreme temperature and explodes. After veterans started growing unstable and exploding, their deaths were used to cover up Extremis' flaws by manufacturing a terrorist plot. The test footage shows that a number of early subjects were killed because of Extremis's flaws.Rhodes tracks the Mandarin's IP address and is led to a sweatshop in the Middle East. But it turns out to be a trap; one of Killian's agents disarms him and knocks him unconscious. Killian's men steal Rhodes' suit.Tony uses the IP address that the Mandarin has been using to hijack American airwaves and traces him to Miami, Florida. Tony infiltrates the estate headquarters using a variety of homemade weapons fashioned from stuff bought at a hardware store, Harley's trademark potato gun, and a limited edition Dora the Explorer watch belonging to Harley's unseen sister.Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually a flighty British actor named Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), who is oblivious to the acts the Mandarin has carried out. When confronted, Slattery manages to tell both Tony and Rhodes that he's the Mandarin, and manages to completely annoy them both, and Tony goes to confront Killian, while Rhodes stays behind and tries to get any information he can out of the completely clueless Slattery. Tony is captured by some of Killian's henchmen - who are also Extremis experiments, and Maya reveals she was working with Killian all along. She thinks Tony can help perfect the Extremis DNA. Aldrich arrives and reveals he has kidnapped Pepper and subjected her to Extremis, intending to infuse her with superhuman abilities and turn her against Tony as leverage to gain Tony's aid in fixing Extremis' flaws. Aldrich then shoots and kills Maya.Tony, strapped to a bed frame by two of Killian's men, escapes by summoning the MK42 suit from Tennessee, piece by piece, and reunites with Rhodes on the estate, discovering that Aldrich intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One.Unfortunately, the MK42 has yet to regain full flight power. Savin boards the President's plane wearing the Iron Patriot suit, shoots the Secret Service agents aboard, and takes the President. Savin then blows holes in the airliner's body and survivors fall out. Iron Man kills Savin and manages to rescue the falling people by using a small electrical current to hold them all together. When he lands on a nearby bridge, the suit is hit by a large truck and breaks into its components, revealing Tony had been controlling it remotely. Meanwhile, the Iron Patriot suit flies away with the President on board. Tony and Rhodes trace Aldrich to an impounded oil drilling platform where Aldrich intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Aldrich's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure a little girl's disability.Rhodes tracks the President to a massive shipyard at Miami's port. Tony enacts a new strategy and has JARVIS enact the ""House Party Protocol"" which unleashes a massive army of Iron Man suits - each one different from the next. On the platform, Tony goes to save Pepper, and Rhodes saves the President. Tony discovers Pepper has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a container crane rig collapses around them and she falls 200 feet to her apparent death. Tony is forced into confronting Aldrich using several suits and finally traps him in the 42 suit that self-destructs. But, a glowing Aldrich survives and staggers toward a defenseless Stark. Killian tells Tony that the Mandarin was made up, that he is the Mandarin and that all attacks were taken out by Extremis experiments. Pepper shows up with Extremis powers and finishes off the weakened Aldrich.After the battle, Tony orders JARVIS to implement the ""Clean Slate Protocol"" which destroys each remaining Iron Man suit remotely, as a sign of his intention to devote more time to Pepper. The Vice President and Slattery are arrested. In a voiceover Tony mentions Pepper is cured and Tony himself undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart, eliminating the need for his chest piece to control it. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea and muses he will always be Iron Man, even without his armor. He gathers some scrap parts from his house wreckage and drives off in his Audi eTron. He then leaves Harley with a rebuilt lab and a new version of Harley's trademark potato gun, telling him that Iron Man will be back, and leaves a thank you note from ""The Mechanic"".In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that Stark has been recounting his experiences to Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, uncredited), who awakens, having fallen asleep at the beginning of Tony's story, followed by the words ""Tony Stark will return""."

They load the ice blocks onto their sled and ride off. A young eight year old boy named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) works alongside them (not very expertly), accompanied by his reindeer Sven (sounds: alsoJonathan Groff). They try to imitate the ice harvesters with a single cubical block of ice and a small child's sled, and follow them away as the Northern Lights fill the night sky.The camera follows the Northern Lights through the sky, before panning down on a stave castle, located on the shores of a Scandinavian fjord, ringed in by cliffs. That night, Princess Elsa of Arendelle (Eva Bella) is fast asleep when her five year old sister Princess Anna (Livvy Stubenrauch) tries to wake her up, wanting Elsa to play with her. Elsa playfully brushes Anna off, until Anna asks, ""do you wanna build a snowman?"" to which Elsa delightfully agrees.Fully awake, the two sisters run downstairs to the ballroom. At Anna's urging, Elsa waves her hands, conjuring up a snow crystal, which she then shoots into the air. It explodes, raining snow down on them. To enhance the winter playground, she then stomps her foot, covering the entire floor with ice. They create a snowman that she nicknames Olaf, who likes warm hugs.

Agdar and his wife hastily load both girls onto their horses and ride at full speed into the mountains.As the royal family gallops through the forests at full speed, they pass by Kristoff, who is still being dragged on his sled by Sven. He becomes curious about the fact that one of the horses is leaving behind a trail of ice, in the middle of the summer.Kristoff and Sven follow the ice trail to an empty clearing that appears to only be populated by a large assortment of moss-covered boulders. From the edge of the clearing, Kristoff watches as Agdar asks the motionless boulders to help him. Seconds later, all the boulders roll into a large circle around Agdar, Idun, Elsa, and the unconscious Anna. The rocks uncurl, revealing themselves to be trolls. The ""boulder"" Kristoff and Sven are watching the event from behind is another rock troll named Bulda, who immediately decides to adopt the visitors after Sven licks her.Grand Pabbie (Ciarán Hinds), the leader of the trolls, shows up and asks Agdar if Elsa was born or cursed with her abilities. He observes that Anna is lucky she was hit in the head, as a hit to the heart would have been fatal. He advises the family that it might be best if Elsa doesn't use her powers around Anna. He alters Anna's memories so she has no knowledge of her sister's powers, remembering only the fun they've had (for instance, Anna will remember her indoor castle ice rink as a mundane winter day). Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that her powers will grow, and although they are beautiful, they will be a great risk to her if she cannot learn to control them, as fear will be her greatest enemy.So Agdar and Idun take measures into their own hands based on what Grand Pabbie has told them. The palace is closed to most visitors. Staffing is reduced to a minimum. Anna and Elsa are separated, and having no memory of what has occurred, Anna is unable to comprehend why Elsa is not allowed to play with her. She often comes to Elsa's closed door and tries to coax her out by asking her if she wants to build a snowman (""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?""). As a further precaution, the sisters are also kept from leaving the castle.While Anna's life is dull but normal, Elsa's powers grow stronger as she matures. Her father cautions her to wear gloves to keep her icy magic in check, and to conceal her feelings, because strong emotions seem to cause her powers to manifest in unexpected ways.Ten years after the accident, the now teenaged princesses become orphans when their parents' ship capsizes in a storm, drowning them. After the burial, Anna goes again to Elsa's door, pleading for consolation from her only remaining family member. But Elsa, though she sits sadly on the the other side of the door, refuses to communicate with Anna.Three Years Later:Elsa (now voiced byIdina Menzel) is now 21 years old, comes of age, and the castle prepares to crown her as the kingdom's queen. Dignitaries from around Europe are coming to visit, including the Duke of Weselton (Alan Tudyk), who wants to run Arendelle's profits dry.Elsa is nervous about emerging from her seclusion and receiving the many guests. When Elsa gives the order to open the castle gates, Anna (now voiced byKristen Bell) eagerly rushes out into the city (""For the First Time In Forever"").As Anna strolls out onto the streets, she crashes into a horse belonging to a charming and handsome visitor, and falls into a rowboat. The visitor apologizes and introduces himself as Prince Hans of the Southern Isles (Santino Fontana), in town for Elsa's coronation. Though Anna is angered at first by Hans's clumsiness (after inadvertently falling on top of her in the rowboat due to said rowboat teetering on the side of a dock and being balanced only by a leg from Hans's horse), she seems smitten by him once she has a real good look at him. Anna runs off when she hears the church bells.Elsa remains nervous during the coronation ceremony. The bishop (Robert Pine) has to remind her to remove her gloves before she takes up her golden orb and scepter. Holding them, she turns to face the congregation, but almost immediately panics when she sees the gold of the orb starting to frost while the bishop is bestowing her authority on her. She returns the orb and scepter hurriedly to the bishop and puts her gloves back on.At the coronation reception a couple hours later, Kai introduces Elsa and Anna to the crowd. Anna's first friendly interaction with Elsa in years brings quite the delightful feeling to Anna, flustered at first, as well as seeing Elsa so happy instead of serious and preserved boosts Anna's confidence, prompting her to continue on with the conversation. They're interrupted afterwards by Kai introducing to them the Duke of Weselton. The Duke is a buffoon (to the point that a running gag throughout the movie is people calling his home place ""Weasel Town""), but an important trading partner. Elsa politely declines his offer to dance with her, but instead playfully volunteers Anna, much to the Duke's delight nonetheless, and the two head off into a comical dance scene. Elsa can't resist chuckling seeing Anna get innocently flustered by the Duke's over-the-top (and incredibly terrible) dancing skills. This causes Anna to feel just as whimsical about the entire matter, for seeing Elsa in such a state hasn't been a sight for years. Anna returns by Elsa's side afterwards, commenting on how well things have been going through the day, and expresses her wishes to have things the way they were that night all the time. Elsa does agree, though her smile quickly fades away as memories of the night she froze Anna's head come floating back to the surface, and she reluctantly denies Anna's wishes all at once despite failing to explain why so.Anna then takes to the floor with Hans. The two of them quickly sneak off to spend the evening together, quickly realizing the mutual attraction between them. The romantic dance eventually leads to an entire date (""Love is an Open Door""), with the entire night of the young couple being spent bonding. Hans, during their time together, learns of Anna's longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister apparently developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting Anna out one day when they were kids. Hans openly relates to this, only furthering Anna's connection with him. Hans then promises to never shut Anna out unlike Elsa, much to the princess' absolute joy.By the end of their tour throughout the kingdom, Hans proposes right on the spot to which Anna immediately accepts. The two head back the ballroom, where Anna asks for Elsa's blessing on the marriage. Elsa's baffled by the shocking news, but Anna and Hans couldn't appear more excited going on to ramble about the wedding arrangements. Elsa ceases the sudden rambling by denying them a marriage license, much to Anna's dismay. Elsa asks to speak to Anna alone in private, likely to finally confess her abilities and why it's not wise to marry someone she just met without causing a scene that would expose her powers, but Anna refuses any private conversation, stating whatever Elsa has to say can be said to both her and Hans. Elsa, becoming impatient and frustrated, outright refuses to let Anna marry someone she just met, indirectly telling Anna she knows nothing about true love. This causes Anna to hiss back, telling Elsa all she knows is how to shut people out. Although Elsa is visibly hurt by this, she continues to refuse, with the argument only worsening when she orders the guards to end the party early and close the gates.Unable to contain her emotions, Elsa makes a violent sweep with her left arm, causing a barrier of sharp icicles to suddenly appear around her. Shocked at the room's reaction to her powers, Elsa rushes from the room.Panicking, Elsa flees with Anna in hot pursuit. As she bolts out the door, she finds a huge crowd waiting for her in the courtyard. She hastily rushes through as men applaud her. A concerned woman asks Elsa if she's all right. She is frightened enough that she backs into an ornamental fountain and freezes it solid when she grabs it with her left hand. The Duke of Weselton comes out the same door moments later. Elsa pleads for people to step back, moments before another bolt of ice shoots from her hands, nearly hitting the Duke and his guards. She keeps running away, sprinting across the waters of the fjord, her feet forming an ice bridge, and vanishes into the forest on the other side of the fjord.Anna calls after her sister, but as she, Hans, and the other guests watch, the waters of the fjord completely ice over and the air takes on an icy chill. Moments later, snow begins to fall.The Duke of Weselton begins to panic, declaring they must take action and put an end to Elsa's curse. Anna, however, refuses and volunteers to seek out Elsa herself and make things right, feeling that it's her fault for pushing her. With Hans being left in charge of the kingdom, Anna sets out on horse to begin her search for Elsa.Meanwhile, Elsa has found her way to a high precipice on the North Mountain, many miles from civilization. It is here she realizes that far away from what she was taught, being on her own, she can begin to control her powers (""Let it Go""). She constructs an elaborate ice palace, changes her confining wardrobe into a shimmering dress, and vows to stay in seclusion, where she feels she can be herself, and harm no one else.The next morning, Anna is seen travelling slowly through knee-deep snow on horseback. Her journey is hindered when her horse is spooked by falling snow and runs off. She is forced to spend the rest of the day trudging through knee deep snow, all the while griping that she wishes Elsa had the ability to cover the fjords in a tropical paradise. She sighs with relief upon seeing a building with smoke coming from a chimney. Just then, Anna slips and falls into an ice-cold creek, which freezes her dress stiff. She staggers the rest of the way to the cabin with the chimney, a place known as Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna, run by its burly owner, Oaken (Chris Williams).Anna quickly staggers into Oaken's store. He doesn't have much winter gear in stock (it's supposed to be the off season), aside from one pair of boots and a single women's mink coat. Anna inquires if Elsa has visited recently, but Oaken tells her that she's the only person crazy enough to be out in a storm like this. As if on cue, Kristoff staggers in out of the storm, seeking to buy some rope, an ax, and carrots for Sven. Oaken can't help but notice that Kristoff is bundled up tightly. Kristoff replies that there's a real howler going on up on the North Mountain. As Anna waits for Oaken to return his attention to her, Kristoff argues with Oaken over the outrageous price gouging on the items he needs (due to Oaken claiming that there's a supply and demand problem since Kristoff is buying from the almost-bare shelves of the winter department), which ends with Oaken roughly throwing Kristoff out into the snow after Kristoff makes the mistake of calling him a crook.Kristoff and Sven take refuge in a barn on Oaken's property, but are soon met by Anna, who has bought Kristoff's supplies for him, on condition he take her up the North Mountain immediately. Kristoff eventually agrees.Anna and Kristoff set off into the night with Sven driving. As the discussion turns to Elsa, Anna explains about her whirlwind engagement to Hans. Kristoff is incredulous at Anna's foolhardiness in getting engaged to someone she just met that day, to the point that he quizzes her about Hans to see how little she really knows about him. Their conversation is interrupted when the sled is ambushed by a pack of wolves. Kristoff is initially reluctant to let Anna assist him, but Anna proves to be useful and manages to take out a few of the wolves by herself. There is a moment of panic when the two see a gaping ravine up ahead. Kristoff hurriedly throws Anna onto Sven's back, then, just as they reach the cliff, he uses his knife to cut Sven's harness. Anna and Sven successfully clear the chasm, and Kristoff does, just barely, but his sled falls to the bottom of the ravine and explodes. Kristoff is at first upset that his sled is gone (as he'd just paid it off), but after ""arguing"" with Sven (which consists of Kristoff speaking his own opinion in his own voice and then delivering Sven's ""counterargument"" in a goofy voice), decides to help Anna keep going, worried for her safety. Anna promises she will replace the sled.Early the next morning, Anna and Kristoff enter a frosted-over glen. They suddenly hear a new voice and meet a talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). The introductions don't go smoothly, as Anna screams and kicks Olaf's head off upon first seeing him. Anna doesn't recognize Olaf until he gives his name and adds, ""and I like warm hugs."" This jogs Anna's memories and she remembers building him with Elsa when they were young. Anna and Kristoff mention that they're looking for Elsa so they can restore summertime, and Olaf suddenly grows excited; it's his dream to see what summer is like, and he fantasizes about what he wants to do in the summertime in a Busby-Berkeley dance number (""In Summer""). Anna and Kristoff choose not to reveal that he will melt in the summer heat, but follow him as he leads them to Elsa's ice palace.In the late afternoon, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf arrive at Elsa's ice palace. Sven waits at the bottom of the stairway leading up to the front doors, as his feet can't get a grip on the icy steps. Meanwhile, when they get to the front door, Anna tells Kristoff and Olaf to wait outside, warning them that the last time she introduced Elsa to a guy, she froze everything (making Elsa look like an overprotective sister). The dejected Olaf and Kristoff wait outside and start counting to 60 while Anna heads inside.Inside, Anna is stunned at the glorious interior of the palace and, even more amazed, to see the new ice dress Elsa has conjured for herself. Though Elsa is happy to see Anna and quickly forgives her for the argument that happened at the coronation party, she becomes nervous and suggests Anna leave so she can't do any harm to her. The conversation is momentarily interrupted when Olaf crashes the meeting (having taken Anna's request of ""give us a minute"" quite literally). Elsa is astonished to find that her powers include the ability to conjure up living snowmen.As it turns out, Elsa is surprised to learn that her entire kingdom is frozen, and Anna is surprised in turn to learn that Elsa doesn't know how to stop it. But Anna insists her sister's powers are no reason why they should be so distant. However, having seen Olaf, Elsa flashes back to accidentally hitting Anna in the head with her snow abilities and grows scared, demanding Anna leave.Elsa retreats to the upper portion of the palace, and Anna follows her, pleading with her sister that they can solve this problem together (""For the First Time In Forever (Reprise)""). But Elsa grows so upset that she unleashes an icy chill, of which a portion accidentally strikes Anna again but this time in her heart.Elsa retreats to the upper portion of the palace, and Anna follows her, pleading with her sister that they can solve this problem together (""For the First Time In Forever (Reprise)""). But Anna's promising to stand by her sister's side and help her, Elsa only grows more agitated and nervous resulting in her magic flaring. Elsa, in desperation to get her sister to safety, creates a giant snow creature (that Olaf calls ""Marshmallow"") to throw them out.Marshmallow deposits Anna, Kristoff and Olaf on the front steps outside the ice palace. Though he initially leaves them alone, Anna is pissed off and quickly throws a snowball at him. Marshmallow is provoked, and chases Anna and Kristoff into the woods.Marshmallow manages to corner them at the edge of a cliff, though Kristoff immediately begins digging a snow anchor by using a rope to safely guide himself and Anna down the mountain to safety. Marshmallow, however, catches up to them, though Olaf tries to stop him (to comically little success). Marshmallow, annoyed, kicks Olaf over the cliff, and continues his chase for Anna and Kristoff. He pulls them up to his face by the rope, and screams in their face ""DON""T COME BACK!"". Anna then grabs Kristoff's knife and cuts the rope. This sends the duo into free fall, onto a twenty foot deep pile of fresh snow. With his mission to drive them away complete, Marshmallow returns to the ice palace.As they recover from the landing, Kristoff notices that Anna's hair has started to turn white. Fearful that she may be injured, Kristoff takes her to his family...who happen to be a group of rock trolls -- the same ones that saved Anna many years before. Kristoff explains that as he had no family at a young age, the trolls took him and Sven in.The trolls are overjoyed to meet Anna, and at first they eagerly believe that she is Kristoff's steady girlfriend, so they try to marry them in a dance number (""Fixer-Upper""), and almost get all the way through the vows before being stopped by the accidental participants and Anna faints. However, he tells them that she is injured and needs their assistance. Just as he did 13 years ago, Grand Pabbie comes forward and examines Anna, but concludes that this time her sister's powers struck her in the heart. Pabbie cannot save her; Anna's heart has begun to freeze. Grand Pabbie says ""an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart."" Anna collapses again and her hair turns more white. She weakly tells Kristoff that Hans can surely help, and they take off for Arendelle.Meanwhile in the city, Hans has been providing shelter and help for Arendelle's people. When Anna's horse returns, riderless, Hans asks for volunteers to join him in bringing Anna back. The Duke of Weselton volunteers his two bodyguards, and secretly tells them to shoot Elsa if they should encounter her.The next morning, Hans's party arrives at Elsa's ice castle. Shortly after they arrive, Hans orders that no harm is to come to Elsa. While everyone agrees, the Duke's thugs quietly disagree, still following the Duke's orders to kill her. The moment they come close enough, Marshmallow reveals himself from the form of snow boulders piled up by the base of the stairs, and jumps right into battle. The archer immediately attack the beast with their arrows, infuriating Marshmallow and causing his ultimate form to be unleashed. Marshmallow is able to hold most of the guards off. Hans, however, proves to be a fierce warrior himself, avoiding each of Marshmallow's attacks and eventually using his sword to slice the snow monster's leg off and cause him to lose balance and begin tumbling over to a large gorge. With Marshmallow wounded, Hans begins heading inside Elsa's castle. Marshmallow, however, doesn't give up, giving one last swing in attempt to drag Hans down with him. Marshmallow fails, and plummets down into the chasm below, apparently to his death.While Hans has been battling Marshmallow, the Duke's two men have managed to use the distraction to barge up the ice steps and into the castle, where they corner Elsa. Despite her pleading for them to not shoot, they shoot at her. She quickly forms walls of ice as shields to block their shots. Eventually, she has the beardless thug pinned to a wall by several icicles and is on the verge of using a wall of ice to shove the bearded thug off the balcony. Hans and his men show up just in time and Hans pleads for her to stop, so she doesn't become the monster people accuse her of being. Elsa settles down a bit at Hans' words, realizing what she's doing. The guy pinned to the wall, still complying with the orders of the Duke, aims his crossbow at Elsa's head and prepares to shoot her. Hans suddenly runs over and deflects the bow. The arrow is released and hits the bolt attaching an icy chandelier to the ceiling, which begins to fall straight for Elsa's head. Elsa tries to run, but the falling chandelier fragments and knocks her unconscious.When Elsa wakes up, she's back at the castle in a dungeon cell, her hands chained and encased in steel mitts. As she looks out over the frozen kingdom, Hans appears, telling Elsa that Anna has not returned, and pleads with her to stop the winter. Elsa claims she can't, and must be let go to keep others from being harmed.Meanwhile, Kristoff and Sven arrive at the castle. Anna's condition has grown worse Kristoff tries to keep her warm by giving her his hat. Several of the castle staff escort her in; she looks back as Kristoff and Sven leave. Anna is brought to Hans and tells him that he has to kiss her in order to save her.The castle staff in the room quickly leave to give them privacy. She explains what happened and she collapses. Hans places Anna in a chair, leans in as if to kiss her... and says ""Oh, Anna, if only there was someone here who loved you!"" As Anna looks at him in shock, Hans explains that as the youngest of 13 brothers, he had no chance at claiming his family's throne, so he went looking for a royal family he could marry into. Unable to get to Elsa, he made Anna's acquaintance and played on her naivete. He intended to marry her before causing some form of ""accident"" for Elsa that would clear his path to the throne.However, given Anna's current condition, he plans to simply let her frozen heart overcome her, then stab Elsa, ending the eternal winter. Anna tries to stop Hans, but he extinguishes the fire in the nearby fireplace before locking her in the room. It is then that Anna collapses, her hair now completely turns white.Hans goes to speak with the duke of Weselton and several other dignitaries. He claims that Elsa has caused Anna to freeze to death, but before she died he and Anna recited their wedding vows. This apparently is enough to give him full authority to declare Elsa guilty of treason and sentence her to death.The palace guards go to Elsa's cell, but are detained when a wall of the cell collapses. While they are held up, Elsa freezes her shackles to the point that they shatter, and then breaks through the wall to the outside.Meanwhile, far from Arendelle, Kristoff and Sven are trekking away when Sven urges Kristoff to go back. Kristoff claims he has no need to, but as they look back at Arendelle, a mysterious swirling cloud of snow begins to engulf the kingdom. The two then take off towards the growing danger.Olaf has managed to find Anna in the locked room, and seeing her freezing, quickly lights a fire in the fireplace. Anna explains that Hans wasn't her true love, and that Olaf should leave or he'll melt. However, the little snowman says he will not leave her side until he finds an act of true love that can save her. As they talk, Olaf recalls how Kristoff did so much to get her back to save her, when the wind blows a window open. Olaf goes to close it, but in the distance he sees Kristoff and Sven charging towards them.This gives Anna hope. She realizes that they're in love: maybe Kristoff can save her. Olaf helps her up, but in the hallway, ice springs up to block their path. Going out a window, the two slide down the castle's steep roofs. Anna attempts to make her way across the icy fjord, with Olaf close behind. However, as the wind picks up, Olaf is blown away, and Anna finds her hands are turning to ice and her face is icy. Even so, she continues to move forward, calling out Kristoff's name.Meanwhile, Hans has found Elsa wandering the ice of the fjord. Thinking he's come for her, Elsa tells him to leave her alone, and take care of Anna. Hans lies and says that Anna was killed by Elsa's magic. The pain of this causes Elsa to collapse, the snow in tears and in the air the snowflakes are suddenly hanging in stillness.The clearing of the whiteout enables Kristoff to see Anna, and he runs to her, but as Anna looks around, she sees Hans about to stab Elsa. Even with her own life at stake, Anna rushes in front of Hans, blocking the knife. As she does so, her frozen heart finally consumes her, turning her into a statue of ice, and shattering Hans' blade.Kristoff and Sven arrive seconds later. Seeing Anna turned to ice, Elsa breaks down in tears, hugging her sister. No one is sure what to say, when Anna's icy form begins to change and gain color, and she returns to normal! Anna broke her own spell: saving Elsa was an act of true love. And her hair turns back to normal and her streak is gone.It is then that Elsa realizes what can end the winter: love. And with this realization, she dissipates the ice and snow, and summer returns to the kingdom. Olaf is found, and before he can melt, Elsa creates a perpetual snow flurry above his head, which lets him survive the summer heat.In the aftermath, Hans is taken back to his kingdom by a French ambassador, who promise to see he is punished for his attempted regicide. The duke is as hotheaded as ever and tries to play the innocent victim. But remembering that he sent two men to kill her, Elsa issues a decree to sever all trade with Weselton. To piss the duke off even further, she tells the messenger to call his duchy ""Weasel Town.""Meanwhile, Anna makes good on her promise and replaces Kristoff's sled. She also tells him that Elsa has appointed him the castle's official ice deliverer. Kristoff is so grateful that he kisses her. If he wonders why a queen who can conjure ice out of thin air needs ice deliveries, he keeps the question to himself.Having come to grips with her powers and learning they can be a blessing and not a curse, Elsa uses them to create a wintry spectacle in the summer sky. She also turns the castle's courtyard into an ice rink, where she informs Anna that the gates to the castle will never be closed again. With the city's people in attendance, the sisters skate around the rink, happy that they are finally together again.After the credits are over, we cut back to Elsa's ice palace, where it's revealed that Marshmallow survived the fall after Hans cut off his leg. Wandering through the empty ice palace, he finds the tiara that Elsa tossed away during ""Let It Go"", and puts it on his head, smiling to himself, and the spikes and fangs on his back quickly retract."

Gru learns that Dr. Nefario, his friend and assistant, has decided to leave him for new employment, because he ""missed being evil."" Gru reluctantly partners with undercover AVL agent Lucy Wilde, and together they search The Paradise Shopping Mall, where they are given a bakery called ""Bake My Day"" as their headquarters.

Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant at night, but only find a jar of secret-recipe salsa and nothing to prove that Eduardo is the culprit. Meanwhile, Agnes expresses her wish of having a mother someday and suspects that Gru will fall in love with Lucy. Gru tells her that his relationship with Lucy is strictly professional.Gru and Lucy investigate wig merchant Floyd Eagle-san, but Gru is still suspicious of Eduardo. After the investigation, Gru is set up on a horrible dinner date with a woman named Shannon, who notices Gru's wig and threatens to humiliate him. Luckily, Lucy bumps into them and rescues him from the date by shooting Shannon with a tranquilizer dart. They take Shannon home, and after they say good night, Gru realizes that Agnes was right: he has romantic feelings for Lucy.The next day, the AVL arrests Floyd Eagle-san (who claims that he was framed) because an almost-empty mutagen jar was found in his shop.

After Jonathan's death, an adult Clark spends several years living a nomadic lifestyle, working different jobs under false names, while saving people in secret as well as struggling with the loss of his adoptive father.He eventually infiltrates a scientific discovery of a Kryptonian scout spaceship in the Arctic. Clark enters the alien ship, and it allows him to communicate with the preserved consciousness of Jor-El in the form of a hologram. Lois Lane (Amy Adams), a journalist from the Daily Planet who was sent to write a story on the discovery, sneaks inside the ship while following Clark and is rescued by him when she is injured. Lois's editor Perry White rejects her story of a ""superhuman"" rescuer, so she traces Clark back to Kansas with the intention of writing an expose. After hearing his story, she decides not to reveal his secret.Zod and his crew seek out other colony worlds, and eventually follow a Kryptonian distress signal sent from the ship Clark discovered on Earth. Zod demands that humans surrender Kal-El, who he believes has the codex, in return for peace. Clark agrees, and the U.S. military hand him and Lois over to Zod's second-in-command, Faora. Zod reveals that he intends to use a Terraforming ""world engine"" to transform Earth into a new Krypton, eradicating the human population in the process, and use the codex to repopulate the planet with genetically-engineered Kryptonians. After Clark and Lois escape Zod's ship, Clark defeats Faora, convincing the military that he is an ally. Zod deploys the world engine and initiates the process in Metropolis and over the Indian Ocean.Clark, now dubbed ""Superman"", stops the world engine in the Indian Ocean and also destroys the ship which carries the pivotal technology, the Genesis Chamber, to restore the Krytonian race with the codex. The military use the spacecraft that brought Clark to Earth in an aerial strike on Zod's ship over Metropolis, returning Zod's crew to the Phantom Zone, completely thwarting Zod's plans. Only Zod remains, and he engages Superman in an aerial battle across Metropolis. When Zod attempts to murder civilians in revenge for his defeat, Superman is forced to kill him. Some time later, Superman continues to earn the U.S. government's trust, although evading their efforts to uncover his secret identity. To create an alias that gives him access to dangerous situations without arousing suspicion, Clark takes a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet."
Gravity,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two astronauts work together to survive after an accident leaves them stranded in space. Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness.—MuTaTeD The crew of the Space Shuttle Explorer is working on the STS-157 mission. Mission Commander Matt Kowalski, medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone - who is on her first ever space mission - and flight engineer Shariff Dasari are on a space walk when they learn from Houston control that an explosion has just occurred at a Russian satellite. Before the crew can do anything about it, the explosion debris comes hurtling toward Explorer, irreparably damaging the shuttle and station, immediately killing all the crew except Kowalski and Stone, and knocking out at least incoming communication with Houston control, although they have no idea if there is outgoing communication. The two are left in a precarious position as Stone is untethered with quickly decreasing oxygen on her person meaning that Kowalski has to retrieve her quickly if she has any chance of survival. Even if he can retrieve her and get her some oxygen, they have the difficult task of trying to get to another satellite with whatever equipment is on hand, and from there ultimately back to Earth. Through the process, they are often on their own without the other leading to an extreme feeling of isolation which leads to individual questions and ultimate decisions about their own mortality and what may be best for the other at the expense of oneself.—Huggo Dr. Ryan Stone is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Her commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky, helming his last flight before retirement. Then, during a routine space walk by the pair, disaster strikes: The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Ryan and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of rescue. As fear turns to panic, they realize that the only way home may be to venture further into space.—Jwelch5742 Commanded by seasoned astronaut Lieutenant Matt Kowalski, the Space Shuttle Explorer orbits Earth to service the Hubble Space Telescope. With his retirement just around the corner, this is a routine mission for the experienced officer. But for novice medical engineer Dr Ryan Stone, Kowalski's second-in-command, this is her first assignment to outer space. And out there, danger lurks in every minor misstep. When a dense cluster of space debris incapacitates the American shuttle during a scheduled spacewalk, the devastating impact tears Stone away from the ship, leaving her tumbling out of control through deep space. With the two stranded officers cut off and the oxygen supplies dwindling, the vulnerable astronauts must summon every last ounce of courage and ingenuity to survive the odds. Marooned, can Kowalski and Stone do the impossible and return to Mother Earth?—Nick Riganas In 2014/2015, bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a Mission Specialist on her first space shuttle mission, STS-157. She is on a spacewalk repairing a panel on the Hubble Space Telescope, accompanied by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who is commanding his final expedition. Mission Control (voice ofEd Harris) suddenly instructs them to abort their spacewalk and return to the STS. Houston tells them that debris from a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite has caused a chain reaction, destroying other satellites, and a huge debris field is heading right at them. Within a couple of minutes, they lose contact with Mission Control, though Stone and Kowalski continue to transmit ""in the blind"", hoping that the ground crew can hear them.High-speed debris strike the STS, sending it spinning wildly, with Stone at the end of the boom arm. A piece of debris breaks the robot arm off from the STS, and Stone is forced to release the tether holding her to the robot arm. Once free, she is thrown far from the STS. Stone panics, trying to contact Houston or Kowalski. Kowalski, who is wearing a thruster pack, suddenly appears and attaches her tether to him. He flies them back to the STS; on the way they find the engineer Shariff (Phaldut Sharma), his helmet smashed and his skull mostly open and empty. They find that the STS Explorer has been catastrophically damaged. The shuttle's interior has been ripped open by debris and the remainder of crew are dead. Kowalski decides to use the thruster pack to get to the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 100 km (60 mi) away. Kowalski estimates they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again.With Stone's oxygen reserve running low, they float through space to the ISS. Kowalski asks Stone about her life back home and learns that her daughter died in a schoolyard accident. As they approach the slightly damaged ISS, they see that its crew has already evacuated in one of the Soyuz modules and that the parachute of the other Soyuz, designated TMA-14M, has accidentally deployed, making it useless for return to Earth. Kowalski says that the Soyuz can still be used to travel to Tiangong, the nearby Chinese space station, to retrieve another module that can take them to Earth. All but out of air and maneuvering fuel for the thruster pack, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they zoom by. The tether holding them together breaks and at the last moment, Stone's leg becomes entangled in the Soyuz's parachute lines. Stone grabs Kowalski's tether, just barely stopping him from flying off into space. Kowalski realizes that his momentum will carry them both away, and over Stone's protests, he decouples his end of the tether so that Stone can survive. The tension in the lines pulls her back towards the ISS. As Kowalski floats away, he radios her with additional instructions about how to get to the Chinese space station, encouraging her to continue her survival mission.Stone enters the ISS through an airlock and gets out of the spacesuit. She begins to get familiarized with the ISS when an alarm suddenly alerts her to a fire. She makes her way to the module where the fire is and attempts to put it out, but she is momentarily stunned when the force of the extinguisher thrusts her backward into the bulkhead. She recovers and knocks the flames down again and pushes through them towards the Soyuz. With the fire closing in, she closes the hatch, pulling in the fire extinguisher at the last moment when it blocks the hatch. She separates from the ISS only to find that the Soyuz's parachute lines are entangled in the station's rigging. She dons a Soviet spacesuit and exits the spacecraft to release the cables when the debris field completes its orbit. Clinging to the Soyuz, the ISS is destroyed around her. Free of the ISS and the parachute lines, Stone reenters the spacecraft and aligns it with Tiangong. She fires the thrusters but the fuel gauge is wrong: the tanks are empty. Stone realizes she is stranded and believes she'll die. After listening to an Inuit fisherman named Aningaaq (voice ofOrto Ignatiussen) on the ground speak to her, she slows the oxygen flow which will cause her to fall into unconsciousness from lack of oxygen before she dies. As she begins to lose consciousness, Kowalski suddenly appears outside, opens the spacecraft lock, and enters the cabin. He cheerfully asks her if she wants to live or die. He tells her to use the Soyuz's landing rockets to reach Tiangong. As she returns to full consciousness, Kowalski is gone, part of a hallucinatory dream. Stone restores the flow of oxygen and uses the landing thrusters to navigate towards Tiangong.With no fuel to slow or to dock the Soyuz with the Chinese station, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz via explosive decompression. She uses the remaining pressure in the fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to push herself towards Tiangong, which has also been abandoned. She enters the Tiangong space station and makes her way through its interior to the Shenzhou capsule. The Tiangong station's orbit has deteriorated due to hits by the debris field and it begins to break up on the upper edge of the atmosphere. Stone is unable to separate the capsule from the space station, and she resigns herself to her fate, whatever it may be.As the space stations begins to break up, the Shenzhou capsule is broken off from the station, and Stone fires the device that separates the capsule from the rest of the spacecraft. As the capsule falls towards earth, it rights itself and descends through the atmosphere. The radio crackles with traffic from Mission Control, who are tracking the capsule, and tell her that rescue is on its way. The chute automatically deploys and Stone lands in a lake near the shore. The cabin is full of smoke, and after she blows the hatch the capsule tilts, allowing water to enter. Just when she thought she was safe, she's unable to exit the capsule. The capsule sinks to the bottom with Stone inside. Stone finds a bubble of air inside the capsule and exits the capsule, shedding her spacesuit so she can get to the surface. She swims to shore and with difficulty, gets up and takes a few shaky steps."

""Sully"" Sullivan (John Goodman) during their days at Monsters University, when they weren't necessarily the best of friends. Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan (John Goodman) are an inseparable pair, but that wasn't always the case. From the moment these two mismatched monsters met, they couldn't stand each other. This movie unlocks the door to how Mike and Sully overcame their differences and became the best of friends.—Disney/Pixar When Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is young, he visits Monsters University on a tour of his primary school. A senior student gives his hat to Mike, and he plans to become a scary monster. Years later, Mike joins the Monsters University and on arrival, he receives a flier of the Scare Games that will take place soon in the campus. Mike also befriends his roommate Randall (Steve Buscemi). When the lazy student James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan (John Goodman), who belongs to a family of famous ""scarers"", breaks into his room, they start a competition in class. Their dispute ends when they accidentally break the pride and joy of Dean Abigail Hardscrabble (Dame Helen Mirren), a cylinder with her greatest achievement - a powerful scream of a boy. They are expelled from the scare classes by Hardscrabble who says that Sully is lazy and Mike is not scary, and they become enemies. When Mike recalls the Scare Games, he sees his only chance to return to the scare course. He makes the application to participate, but he learns that he needs a fraternity. Mike joins the Oozma Kappa that is the only fraternity available with four losers, but he is informed that the fraternity needs to have six members. Sully offers to complete the team and Mike has no other alternative but accept Sully in his team. Then he bets with Hardscrabble that if he wins the games, she will accept them in the scare classes. Soon the game begins.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil When Little Mike Wazowski went onto the Scare Floor, he wanted nothing more than to become a scarer. Years later, he spends the rest of his days at Monsters University. But, then he meets the lazy student James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan (John Goodman), who is way more of a scarer than he is and is the family of the famous scarers. Then, Mike (Billy Crystal) competes for the Scare Games. But, little does he know he needs a fraternity. Soon, he has a team of four losers who are no good at anything. Then, Mike has to be friendly to Sully when he joins their team. Now, Mike and Sully have to win this in order to not just become the best of friends, but get themselves and their fraternity into the Scare Program. It's gonna be a lot of hard work. A younger Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), the one-eyed monster we all know and love, attends Monsters University, the school of his dreams. However, when he meets a blue and purple polka-dotted student, James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan (John Goodman) in his same program, things go downhill from there. Mike must compete in the Scare Games to prove to everyone, especially the dean, that he is scary, but Sully, his enemy, has joined his team. In the end, Mike must learn that some things cannot be taught.—Eric Michael ""Mike"" Wazowski, a six-year-old monster, visits Monsters Inc., a scaring company, on a school field trip. During the visit, the class meets Frank McCay, an employee of the company who works as a ""scarer"", entering the human world to scare children at night and harvesting their screams as energy to power the monster world. Mike, enchanted with the idea of being a scarer, slips through Frank's door before anyone can stop him, where he watches Frank's scare performance, then follows him back through the door to the monster world. Frank scolds Mike, but is impressed with his ability to have followed him unnoticed, and gives him his Monsters University hat as a souvenir. Oblivious to his teacher's later admonishments, Mike dreams of being a scarer when he grows up.Approximately eleven years later, Mike is a scare major at Monsters University. On his first day, he meets his new roommate, Randall ""Randy"" Boggs, a nerdy monster that can turn invisible. During the first class of the scare program, as Mike is answering a question, he is interrupted by another scare student, an arrogant large blue monster named James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan. The class is also informed by Abigail Hardscrabble, the strict Dean of the scare program, that they must pass their final exam of the semester to continue in the program. While Mike is studying one night, Sulley inadvertently barges into his room to hide the pig mascot he stole from their rival college, Fear Tech. While the two bicker, the pig steals Mike's MU hat and escapes. Mike and Sulley give chase, but when Mike finally manages to capture it, Sulley takes credit, and is invited to join Roar Omega Roar, the elite fraternity on campus. Mike wishes to join, but is rejected, magnifying the rivalry between the two.Mike studies hard and repeatedly answers questions in class correctly, while the privileged Sulley, convinced all he needs is his natural scaring ability, begins to falter. At the final exam, Mike and Sulley's rivalry causes Hardscrabble to fail them both and dropping them from the program, which prompts Roar Omega Roar to remove Sulley from the fraternity. Dissatisfied in his boring new major, Mike decides to prove himself by entering the Scare Games, an extracurricular scaring competition. As the games are only for fraternity or sorority members, Mike joins Oozma Kappa, a small fraternity of misfit monsters. When Mike and Oozma Kappa are denied entry as they are one team member short, Sulley offers to join, seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program, and Mike eventually reluctantly accepts. Mike also makes a deal with Dean Hardscrabble, who remains skeptical, to re-admit their entire team to the scaring program if they win, whereas if they lose, Mike must leave Monsters University. Sulley expects to carry the team by himself, but Mike believes that with enough training, the whole team can succeed.With the last-placing team in each round of the Games being eliminated from the competition, Oozma Kappa fails the first challenge miserably but miraculously advances when another team is disqualified. They then attend a party at Roar Omega Roar house where initially the other competitors appear to accept them, but the fraternity pranks and humiliates them instead. The group is discouraged as they are now the laughingstock of the entire campus, so Mike arranges a secret visit to Monsters, Inc. to lift their spirits. After that, Oozma Kappa uses their wits and training to advance to the final round against Roar Omega Roar. Even having advanced so far, Sulley does not think that Mike can be a true scarer because of his lack of natural ability. After the team wins the final round, Mike discovers that Sulley manipulated the equipment to improve Mike's score. Mike is heartbroken and wants to prove that he is capable of becoming a scarer, so he breaks into the school's door lab and enters a door to the human world, but discovers that the door leads to a summer camp and he is unable to scare the cabin full of children.Back at the university, Sulley confesses to The Dean, Hardscrabble, that he cheated, just as she is notified of the break-in. Realizing what happened, Sulley enters the door to look for Mike. After finding Mike and reconciling, the pair, now being pursued by human adults, attempt to return, but find themselves trapped in the human world, as Hardscrabble has deactivated the door waiting for the authorities arrive. Mike realizes that the only way to get back into the monster world is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sulley and Mike terrify the adults, generating an overwhelming amount of scream energy and allowing them to return to the lab. Their actions lead to their expulsion from the university, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester as Hardscrabble was impressed with their performance in the games. They share goodbyes and as Sulley and Mike leave, Hardscrabble tells them they are the first to have surprised her, and wishes them luck for the future. Mike and Sulley work at Monsters, Inc. in the company mailroom with the Abominable Snowman as the mailroom's manager. Working their way up through the company, the two eventually become part of the Scarer Team."
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1170358/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The dwarves, along with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey, continue their quest to reclaim Erebor, their homeland, from Smaug. Bilbo Baggins is in possession of a mysterious and magical ring. After successfully crossing over (and under) the Misty Mountains, Thorin and Company must seek aid from a powerful stranger before taking on the dangers of Mirkwood Forest--without their Wizard. If they reach the human settlement of Lake-town it will be time for the hobbit Bilbo Baggins to fulfill his contract with the dwarves. The party must complete the journey to Lonely Mountain and burglar Baggins must seek out the Secret Door that will give them access to the hoard of the dragon Smaug. And, where has Gandalf got off to? And what is his secret business to the south?—Otaku-sempai The thirteen dwarves commanded by Thorin, the burglar Bilbo Baggins and the wizard Gandalf travel to Lonely Mountain to steal the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug to join the dwarves. During their dangerous journey, they need to fight against giant spiders and Orcs and they are captured but flee from the Elves. But Smaug is not easily deceived and flies to Lake-town to destroy the town and the dwellers.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil As Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo Baggins and Dwarf King Thorin II Oakenshield's long and perilous journey to the heart of the Lonely Mountain continues, a relentless pursuit by the vicious orc, Azog, will inevitably lead the brave fellowship into the dark forests of Mirkwood. Without the sage wizard's guidance, both hobbit and dwarves must keep on venturing into danger undeterred, concentrating solely on their primary mission to retrieve the stolen Arkenstone from Smaug. But atop a mountain of Erebor's pilfered gold, the omnipotent drake is waiting silently, ready to put up a fight for his beloved treasure. Who dares to challenge him?—Nick Riganas Thorin and his company are being pursued by Azog and his Orc party following the events of the previous film. They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of Beorn, a skin-changer who can take the form of the bear. That night, Azog is summoned to Dol Guldur by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war, so Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son Bolg. The following day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of Mirkwood, where Gandalf discovers Black Speech imprinted on an old ruin. Heeding a promise he made to Galadriel, he warns the company to remain on the path and leaves to investigate the tombs of the Nazgûl. Upon entering the forest, the dwarfs lose their way and are ensnared by giant spiders. Bilbo sets about freeing them with the help of his recently acquired invisibility ring. He subsequently drops the ring and first begins to understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it.. In a flashback set in the town of Bree on the border of the Shire, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) arrives at the Prancing Pony, orders a meal, and notices that he's being watched by several sinister-looking patrons. The watchers withdraw when Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) joins Thorin. Gandalf urges Thorin to begin a quest to obtain the Arkenstone. The stone will enable Thorin to reclaim the dwarves' lost kingdom of Erebor from the dragon Smaug and claim the throne of King under the Mountain. Gandalf suggests recruiting a burglar to steal the Arkenstone from the dragon-guarded mountain.Twelve months later, not long after the end of the previous film, Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Gandalf, Thorin and the dwarven company are chased by the orcs down from the Carrock, where Bilbo spots an enormous bear lurking nearby. Gandalf urges the company to seek refuge in a nearby house. They make it there just barely ahead of the bear -- which, once the doors are safely barred, Gandalf reveals to be their host, Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), a skin-changer who can take the form of a man or a bear. Remarking that he dislikes dwarves but hates orcs much more (they hunted and tortured his kind for centuries, and Beorn is the last of them), Beorn loans his horses to the company so that they can outrun the pursuing orcs and enter Mirkwood Forest.Azog (Manu Bennett), the leader of the orcs, is summoned to Dol Guldur where he is given command of the armies by the Necromancer (voice:Benedict Cumberbatch). Azog gives his son, Bolg (Lawrence Makoare), the task of hunting the dwarves.Gandalf departs as the others enter Mirkwood, urging Bilbo and the dwarves not to stray from the forest path and to wait for him before entering the mountain. After losing their way because of the evil enchantments that make the forest so dangerous, Bilbo climbs a tree to get their bearings. He spots the Lonely Mountain but also sees the tops of the trees fluttering unnaturally. When he climbs down, he discovers that the company has been captured by large and evil spiders. Bilbo, with the help of his sword (which he names Sting during this encounter) and the One Ring, kills two of the spiders and manages to free the dwarves from the webs of the spiders. However, while fighting the attacking spiders, the dwarves are captured by Wood-elves led by Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the son of the Elven King Thranduil (Lee Pace). Thorin holds a grudge against Thranduil for refusing the help the dwarves after Smaug drove them out of the Lonely Mountain, and he refuses to negotiate. Thranduil orders them all imprisoned in the elves famous cells, reputed to be completely escape-proof. Bilbo, however, uses his ring to escape the elves' notice and follows the prisoners to their dungeon.Kili (Aidan Turner) falls for Tauriel, who seems intrigued by him. Legolas is also sweet on Tauriel, but she's been told by King Thranduil to discourage him; Legolas is not for the likes of her.Under the cloak of his ring, Bilbo steals the jailer's keys and helps the dwarves to escape from the halls of the Wood Elves using empty wine barrels, in which they float down the river. Along the way, they are attacked by Bolg and his band of orcs, who had been lying in wait. When Kili tries to open the river gate, Bolg wounds him with a poisoned arrow. Tauriel and Legolas, sent to chase down the escaping dwarves, end up helping them fend off the orcs.Several miles downriver, Bilbo and the company meet Bard (Luke Evans), a bowman and descendant of the original lord of Dale, who was waiting to collect the empty barrels in his barge. They pool their coins to bribe Bard to smuggle them into Lake-town (Esgaroth). Using the empty barrels, Bard covers the dwarves and Bilbo with a load of fish. When he's stopped at the main gate, Alfrid (Ryan Gage), the weaselly assistant to the town's Master, stops him, nitpicking that the barrels are supposed to be empty and the contents will be dumped into the lake. Bard argues that the town's residents need the fish for food and Alfrid lets him go, warning him that he knows where Bard lives & he's being watched. Bard replies that the town is small & ""everyone knows where everyone lives.""Bard sneaks the dwarves past the town's extensive spy network and they enter his house through the privy undetected. The dwarves scoff at the makeshift weapons Bard provides and consequently are captured trying to steal better weapons from the town armory. They're taken before the Master of Lake-town (Stephen Fry), where Thorin convinces the townsfolk and the Master that the dwarves will share the riches of the recaptured mountain with Lake-town. The adventurers receive a grand send-off, but Thorin makes Kili stay behind because his wound is slowing him down -- in fact, it's getting worse. Oin (John Callen) and Kili's brother Fili (Dean O'Gorman) stay with him. Bofur (James Nesbitt) stays too because he passed out under the table during the feast and misses the boat.Meanwhile, Thranduil learns from a captured orc that Sauron has returned, and decides to seal off the Elf kingdom in Mirkwood to protect it from the impending evil. However, Tauriel leaves to help the injured Kili and a concerned Legolas gives chase.The remainder of Thorin's company make their way to Erebor and search for the cliff that houses Durin's Door. In a sheltered nook, they find the spot shown on the map and try to locate the keyhole. When they can't find it, they try to bludgeon their way in and are defeated. Hopeless, they leave in frustration, knowing that the sun has set on Durin's Day, the last day of Fall. However, a few moments later, Bilbo deciphers the clue on Thorin's map about the last light of Durin's Day; moonlight shines on the keyhole and Bilbo excitedly calls them back. Thorin unlocks the secret door into the mountain. Thorin is overcome with emotion at the sight of his old home and sends Bilbo in to find the Arkenstone. Balin (Ken Stott) warns Bilbo not to wake the dragon.Bilbo sneaks down the tunnel and attempts to find the Arkenstone, but Smaug (voice:Benedict Cumberbatch) wakes up and discovers him. Bilbo slips on the ring, becoming invisible. Though Smaug is fearsome, Bilbo stands his ground and placates the dragon. Smaug is flattered but still furious that anyone would challenge the sanctity of his dwelling. Smaug continues to question Bilbo, gaining further clues to his intruder's identity. Eventually, Bilbo spots the Arkenstone but is unable to take it. Smaug mentions he wants Bilbo to steal it -- the dragon knows that Thorin will fall under the same influence as his grandfather and be overcome by greed. As the dragon passes over Bilbo, the hobbit spies the bare spot on Smaug's chest where the black arrow shot by Bard's ancestor knocked a scale loose.At the same time, Gandalf, after sending Radagast away with a message for Galadriel, knowingly steps into the orc-ambushed Dol Guldur and engages Azog, his band of orcs, and the Necromancer in a fierce battle. During the battle, the Necromancer appears to Gandalf as the Eye of Sauron, revealing his true identity. The battle ends with Gandalf's capture.Tauriel and Legolas arrive at Lake-town in the nick of time to fight off the orcs, who have tracked the dwarves to Bard's house. Legolas goes off after Bolg, sparring with him on the floating byways of Lake-town before embarking on a mounted pursuit on land. Tauriel attends to the wounded Kili using her healing magic and some kingsfoil that Bofur scrounged out of a pigsty. Sensing that the dragon is coming, Bard sets off to load the last Black Arrow into the town's windlance (a large crossbow mounted on a tower) so that it can pierce the weakened spot in the dragon's armor. (The weak spot is a missing scale, courtesy of Bard's ancestor Girion, last lord of Dale.) Bard is captured by the Master's men, but not before handing off the Black Arrow to his son Bain (John Bell), who hides it in a small boat.The dwarves enter the mountain to help Bilbo. An infuriated Smaug chases them through the caverns. When Thorin and the company enter an isolated room, they find the last of Thror's folk lying dead, trapped by Smaug many years before -- they subsequently starved to death. Thorin refuses to surrender and thinks of a new plan to trick Smaug into rekindling the forge using his fiery breath. The gold in the furnaces melts and is set loose, flowing down a series of channels and into a giant mold of his grandfather, King Thror. Smaug, having deciphered a clue of Bilbo's, ""barrel-rider"", sets out to burn Lake-town in revenge. He is stopped when he sees Thorin atop the giant mold. The sides of the mold are cut loose and the solid gold statue that had formed suddenly collapses and covers Smaug with molten gold. After a few moments, Smaug bursts out, breaking free of the main gate and takes to the air, shaking off the gold coating. Bilbo watches Smaug fly off into the night to wreak havoc on Esgaroth and says ""What have we done?"""

Having just earned a tidy $100 million for taking down a ruthless criminal kingpin, Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) have decided to lie low for a while. Fugitives from the law, they're constantly looking over their shoulders, no matter where they travel. Meanwhile, the malevolent leader of an elusive criminal outfit (Luke Evans) has incurred the wrath of Agent Hobbs, who has decided that the only way to shut them down is to beat them on their own turf. Realizing that Dom knows the only drivers in the world with the skills to get the job done, Agent Hobbs offers them all full pardons if they will come to London, and get back behind the wheel. The closer the renegade drivers get to the organization, however, the more apparent it becomes that Dom's former lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is not only still alive, but a key figure among their ranks. Now, with their freedom finally within reach, Dom and the team reassemble for their most dangerous mission to date.. Following their successful Rio heist, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew of professional criminals have retired around the world: Dominic lives with his new girlfriend Elena (Elsa Pataky); his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) lives with Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and their son Jack; Gisele (Gal Gadot) and Han (Sung Kang) have moved to Hong Kong; and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) live in luxury.Meanwhile, Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his partner Riley Hicks (Gina Carano) investigate the destruction of a Russian military convoy by former British Special Forces soldier Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his crew. Hobbs tracks down Dominic and persuades him to help take down Shaw after showing him a recent photo of the supposedly long-dead Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Dominic's former girlfriend. Dominic gathers his crew together and they accept the mission in exchange for full amnesty for their past crimes, allowing them to return home to the United States; Mia and Elena remain with Jack.The crew travels to London where one of Shaw's henchmen leads them to Shaw's hideout, but it is revealed to be a trap intended to distract the crew and police while Shaw's crew performs a heist elsewhere. Shaw flees by car, detonating his hideout behind him and disabling most of the police, leaving Dominic, Brian, Tej, Han, Gisele, Hobbs and Riley to pursue him. Letty arrives to help Shaw, and shoots Dominic without hesitation before escaping.Back at their headquarters, Hobbs tells Dominic's crew that Shaw is stealing components to create a Nightshade device which can disable power in an entire region; he intends to sell it to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, Shaw's investigation into the opposing crew reveals Letty's relationship with Dominic, but she is revealed to be suffering from amnesia and is now a brainwashed associate working for Shaw.Dominic's crew investigates a Shaw subordinate who reveals Shaw's connection to Arturo Braga (John Ortiz), a drug lord imprisoned by Brian in 'Fast & Furious 4'. Brian returns to the United States as a prisoner to gain access to Braga, who discloses how Letty survived the explosion that was thought to have killed her. Apparently, Shaw attempted to finish her off but after learning of her amnesia, he took her in. Aided by a former ally in the FBI, Brian is released from prison. In London, Dominic challenges Letty in a street racing competition, and afterwards returns her necklace he had kept.Tej tracks Shaw's next attack to a NATO base in Spain. His crew assaults a military convoy carrying a computer chip to complete the Nightshade device. Dominic's crew interferes, destroying the convoy while Shaw, accompanied by Letty, commandeers a tank and begins destroying cars along the highway. Brian and Roman manage to flip the tank; Letty is thrown from the tank and Dominic risks his life to save her from falling to her death. Shaw and his men are captured, but he reveals that he has kidnapped Mia and his men will kill her unless he is released.The crew is forced to release Shaw, and Riley (finally revealed to be a double-agent working for Shaw) leaves with him; Letty chooses to remain with Dom. Shaw's group board a large aircraft in motion on a runway as Dominic's crew gives chase. Dominic, Letty, Brian, and Hobbs board the craft; Brian rescues Mia and they escape using a car on board. The plane attempts to take off but is held down by excess weight as Han, Gisele, Roman, Tej, Brian, and Mia tether the plane to their vehicles. Gisele sacrifices herself to save Han from one of Shaw's henchmen whom she shoots, but falls from the plane to her death. Letty kills Riley and escapes with Hobbs to safety, but Dominic pursues Shaw and the computer chip. Shaw is thrown from the plane as it crashes into the ground; Dom drives one of the remaining cars through the nose of the exploding plane and reunites with his crew, giving the chip to Hobbs to secure their amnesty.In the aftermath, Dominic and his team return to the United States. Hobbs and Elena (now working with Hobbs) arrive to confirm the crew are free; Elena accepts Dominic has chosen Letty over her. As Dominic's crew gather to share a meal at his house, Dominic asks Letty if the gathering feels familiar; she answers no, but that it feels like home.In a mid-credits, in Tokyo, while Han is in a car chase, he is hit by an oncoming car. Han's car explodes, killing him (the scene from Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift). The other car's driver (Jason Statham, uncredited) walks away from the scene and calls Dominic, leaving him a message: ""You don't know me, you're about to..."""
Oz the Great and Powerful,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1623205/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A small-time magician is swept away to an enchanted land and is forced into a power struggle between three witches. Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz. At first he thinks he's hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking. That all changes, however, when he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.—Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures In 1905, in Kansas, the small-time circus magician Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs is a weak, greedy, selfish and womanizer conman without character. He gives music boxes to the women that he seduces, and when a strong artist finds that his wife has a box in her belongings, he chases Oz through the circus. Oz flees in a balloon, but a tornado strikes his balloon and he lands on the Land of Oz. Oscar meets the gorgeous Theodora and she believes that he is the powerful magician from an ancient prophecy that will release her land from the Wicked Witch. Theodora tells that her sister and she are good witches, but the Wicked Witch had killed the king. Now the people are waiting for the magician to be their new king after defeating the witch. Theodora is seduced by Oz and brings him to the City of Emerald. When he sees the king's treasure, he decides to seek out the Wicked Witch and destroy her magic wand to get rid off her and become the king. Oz meets Glinda, who is supposed to be the Wicked witch, and soon he learns that Theodora's sister Evanora is the evil one indeed. Meanwhile Evanora lures he sister that is jealous and uses a spell to turn her into a wicked witch. Oscar learns that he is the only hope for the inhabitants of Oz that believe that he is a powerful magician and his only chance to defeat Evanora and Theodora is using illusion since he has no magic power.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Stranded with his hot air balloon during a wild tempest, Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs, an ambitious and smug magician of a travelling circus, he will eventually land in the mythical Land of Oz. In the streets of the Emerald city, he will encounter many strange creatures as well as the good people of Oz who will all see him as the wizard who was prophesied to save the peaceful land from the clutches of the Wicked Witch. Sooner or later, Oscar will have to use all of his tricks that hides in his sleeves, equal doses of imagination and sensory manipulation by means of theatrical illusion, all topped with a sprinkle of magic to prove without a doubt that he can be indeed the Great Wizard of Oz.—Nick Riganas Shady illusionist Oscar Diggs (James Franco) enchants curious audiences at a Kansas circus. A self-professed con man, he's a fast-talking performer who aspires to follow in the footsteps of inventors like Thomas Edison. Oscar is being chased across the circus grounds by the rampaging Strongman when a tornado blows in and everyone runs for cover. Seeing a hot-air balloon as his only chance for escape, the illusionist jumps in and cuts himself free. Magically transported to the wondrous world of Oz, he soon encounters Theodora (Mila Kunis), a temperamental witch who surmises that he is the wizard named after their land (Oscar's nickname is Oz), foretold to fall from the sky, defeat a nasty witch, and ascend to the throne. Theodora takes Oscar to the Emerald City to meet her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), a powerful witch who reveals that he cannot become the rightful ruler of Oz until he's accomplished his mission. Later, as Oscar and his new flying-monkey companion Finley (voice of Zach Braff) prepare to face their fearsome enemy, they're joined by the fragile but fearless China Girl (voice of Joey King) and benevolent witch Glinda the Good (Michelle Williams), who help them prepare for the arduous battle ahead. Together with the brave people of Oz, Oscar draws up a plan to rid the land of evil once and for all, and become the great and powerful king who will rule from his throne in the Emerald City.k. This ""prequel"" to 'The Wizard of Oz' opens in Kansas in the year 1905 (in black-and-white with a standard frame), Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is an ambitious illusionist/con man employed by a mid western traveling circus. Despite being greatly ambitious, Oscar's magic career isn't taking off. His illusions are cheap, his suits are torn and patched, and he's barely making enough money to keep his head above water. Frank (Zach Braff), Oscar's circus assistant, barges into Oscar's caravan as he puts the moves on his latest magician's assistant May (Abigail Spencer).He produces a small wooden music box, which he claims once belonged to his great-grandmother, and gives it to May as a token of his love. Frank reminds Oscar, (or Oz, as he's known), that his next show is about to begin. Frank hands Oz the show's cash takings: an old hat filled with a dozen quarters and nickels. Oz reluctantly plucks a pair of coins from the hat and gives them to Frank, and pockets the rest. Frank is unhappy with how Oz treats him.The magic show begins with Oz striding out onto the stage in a mystical, quasi-oriental robe and turban A young girl in a wheelchair in the front row (Joey King) watches in awe as Oz calls for a volunteer. A dozen hands shoot up, but none belong to May, Oz's assistant and ringer for the show. Oz finally calls May to the stage, much to the bewilderment of the crowd, and she takes the stage. Backstage, Frank produces all of the practical effects for the show: playing music, setting off pyrotechnics, etc. On stage Oz puts May into a deep sleep and causes her unconscious body to float in mid air.An irate voice shouts something from the back: ""I see a wire!"" Another voice joins in: ""Yeah! I see two of 'em!"" Bright lights are cast onto the stage, and sure enough, two very visible wires are seen suspending May's body from the ceiling ""I want my money back you fraud!"" Oz gestures to Frank, who tosses him a scimitar. Oz flicks the scimitar between his hands and then violently cuts the visible wires.... but May remains floating. The crowd gasps and Oz, for the finale, whips the silk sheet off of May's body, revealing empty air. The crowd applauds in unison, and Oz happily accepts the ""Bravos!"" and ""Encores!"", and then a small voice cuts through the cheers: ""Make me walk!"" All goes silent.The little girl in the front row, in the wheelchair, pushes herself toward the stage and repeats her pleas ""Please, Wizard. Make me walk!"" Oz, caught off guard by the unscripted request, seeks a diplomatic or heartfelt response, but all that comes out is ""I'm not that kind of wizard, kid."" The crowd turns on him, booing and hissing. Oz, who is now being pelted by popcorn and peanut shells, tells Frank to close the curtains.Outside, the circus-folk are hurriedly packing up the traveling circus as gray clouds swirl above them. Frank takes Oz aside and tells him that a certain lady-friend is waiting for him in his caravan. He sidesteps the chaos, enters his caravan and is surprised to see a young blonde woman, and not May, waiting for him. This is Annie (Michelle Williams); one of Oz's old romances he met on the road. She's come to see Oz because another man proposed to her and she wanted to tell him first. The pair's chemistry is obvious, but Oz's philandering has ruined anything they might have had. Outside, May watches as another brunette, close to her age, bursts out of a tent holding a music box identical to the one Oz gave her. She swiftly realizes that Oz used her.Seconds later an angry strong-man, the woman's husband, comes bursting out of the tent, hell-bent on tearing Oz a new one. The strong-man, along with a clown assistant, crashes through Oz's caravan wall and chases Oz all through the fairground. Oz manages to sneak aboard a readied hot air balloon and escape the clutches of the strong-man. As he soars away Frank throws Oz his hat and magician's bag, filled with his various illusionary instruments. From above Oz watches as all the circus folk fearfully run away, and then he sees it: a massive tornado which is sucking him in. Oz pins himself as tightly as possible into the balloon's basket as the entire contraption is violently whipped back-and-forth inside the tornado.After nearly being impaled dozens of times, Oz and the balloon escape the violent winds of the twister and emerge...... in the colorful, widescreen World of Oz. Oz and the balloon luckily avoid hitting the giant mountains surrounding them, but the balloon ultimately crashes through a raging river of rapids, and Oz unceremoniously lands in a shallow river. Oz, bewildered, finds himself surrounded with gigantic sentient plants and small mischievous fairies which peck at his legs. He calls out for help, and through the bushes appears the beautiful and alluring Theodora (Mila Kunis), a young, dark-haired woman adorned with black slacks, a white blouse and a maroon colored suit jacket with a large sun hat.Theodora answers him and Oz, struck by her beauty, puts on the charm. He tells her that his name is Oz, and she is shocked; some prophecy foretold that a wizard named Oz (the name of their land) would return to Oz and save them from the Wicked Witch. Oz, jokes that all witches must be green, warted, and must ride a broom, to which Theodora responds ""but I'm a witch."" She explains that there are good witches and wicked witches, and that she is simply a good witch. Mysterious growling echoes from the forest nearby and Theodora, recognizing the sound of the Wicked Witch's minions tells Oz to hide. The pair disappear into an alcove and watch as a frightening winged howler monkey swoops in and searches for them. Oz, thinking quickly, reaches into his top hat and retrieves a white dove which he releases into the air. The howler monkey, seeing the bird, flies off after it. Oz and Theodora escape and begin their trek to the Emerald City.Oz uses his charms to appeal to Theodora, and she soon falls in love with him. She tells him that as the new Wizard of Oz, he will soon become the land's new king and that, if he will allow it, she will be his queen. As a token of his love, Oz gives Theodora a wooden music box -- the same type of box given to May and countless other women he met over the years. The pair walks toward the Emerald City and soon come across a winged Capuchin monkey, wearing a blue bellhop uniform and cap, tangled in a mass of man eating plants. Theodora implores that Oz help the monkey and Oz, eager to impress his new girl, frees the monkey, named Finley (voice of Zach Braff) from the weeds.Oz soon realizes that the plants were not the true threat. A massive lion appears, about to pounce on Oz and Finley. Oz, without thinking, reaches into his jacket pocket and tosses a handful of powder to the ground. Thick red smoke explodes from the ground and frightens the cowardly lion away. Theodora, now convinced that Oz is the true wizard of the prophecy, hugs him. Finley, thankful for Oz's intervention, offers his servitude to Oz for life. Finley explains that as a debtor to Oz, he must do anything and everything Oz says. Oz immediately tells the shocked Finley that he is not the Wizard that Theodora thinks that he is. He's just a con man, with a few illusions and tricks up his sleeve. Finley is disappointed to hear this news, but doesn't tell Theodora. Oz hands his heavy bag to Finley and tells him to follow them.The trio soon meets a large caravan of horses and soldiers along a yellow-brick road. Their leader, Knuck (Tony Cox) does not believe Oz is the great wizard Theodora says he is. Oz talks down to Knuck, calls him ""sour puss"" and tells him to obey his king. Oz and Theodora jump into a carriage and are whisked away to the Emerald City. Inside the city Theodora introduces Oz to her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) -- another young brunette witch with a green sapphire necklace around her neck. Both wise and beautiful, Evanora looks at Oz with skepticism. She and Theodora take him to the throne room, which Oz treats with little reverence. Evanora chides the gullible Theodora for believing that Oz was the wizard from the prophecy, but agrees to humor Oz until she can fully prove that he's a fraud.Evanora takes Oz to the King's vault: a massive chamber overflowing with gold and riches, all property of the King of Oz. Oz excitedly dives into the piles of gold while the ever skeptical Evanora looks on. She reminds Oz that the vault is the property of the King of Oz, which he will be only when he kills the Wicked Witch. Oz, realizing that his Kingship comes with strings attached, drops the gold and begins to believe that he'll never be king. Evanora soothes him and explains that killing the Wicked Witch won't be difficult. All that's required is breaking her wand; break the wand, kill the witch, that's it. Bolstered by this new found information, Oz readies himself to go find the witch.With Finley in tow, Oz heads off to the dark woods to find and kill the Wicked Witch. Along the way the pair happens across a recently devastated town. The entire city is made of porcelain: porcelain houses which look like gigantic teapots, porcelain trees, and porcelain residents. It's all too spooky. They hear crying inside one of the few still-standing houses. Inside they find a tiny, young porcelain girl who, after the attack, was broken. Her legs were separated from her body, and she's unable to move. Oz comforts the China Girl (voice of Joey King) and produces, from his bag, a small bottle of instant-dry glue. He repairs her shattered legs and helps her get to her feet.She happily thanks Oz and Finley and tags along with them on their journey. The trio comes to a fork in the road; turn left for the Emerald City, turn right for the dark woods. Oz tells the China Girl to walk to the Emerald City and tell Evanora that she is a friend of Oz. The China Girl throws a fit, and refuses to leave Oz as her family and friends are broken and dead, and he's the only friend she's got. Oz allows the China Girl to follow them to the dark woods.The Dark Woods are frightening. Twisted, violent plants try to impale the trio as they make their way deeper into the forest. They finally come to a cemetery and see a dark, hooded figure trying to enter. They quickly realize that the figure must be the Wicked Witch, and watch as the figure carefully places its wand onto a pile of boxes nearby. While Finley distracts the figure, Oz sneaks over to the wand, takes it and is about to break it in two when a soothing voice stops him.The hooded figure unveils herself, revealing a beautiful blonde face beneath it, identical to Annie (Michelle Williams in a dual role). She introduces herself as Glinda the good witch of the South and explains that the true Wicked Witch is back at the Emerald City. Evanora, years ago, sought to rule Oz by herself and killed their wizard father, the King, so she could rule uncontested. When rumors swelled that the Wizard of Oz would return and take his place as King, Evanora vowed to never let that happen. She'd trick the Wizard into killing the sister who opposed her, Glinda, and then kill the Wizard herself so that she could rule Oz forever. When Glinda learned of Evanora's treachery, she left the Emerald City and spent every day at her father, the King's, grave.Back in Emerald City Evanora watches, in her crystal ball, as her plans to kill Glinda failed. Angered, Evanora sends out her armies to stop and kill Oz and Glinda. Back in the graveyard, the quartet of Oz, Glinda, Finley and China Girl hear the stomping of boots approaching. Evanora's army marches through the graveyard, intent on killing them. Glinda pleads with Oz to do something magical to stop the army and Oz, being nothing more than a con man illusionist, asks her to take care of it. She takes her wand and draws thick fog out of the ground, blinding the army of Winkies and baboons.The quartet finds themselves at the end of a cliff, hanging over a bottomless pit and Glinda, with no other option, leaps off the cliff. With the army quickly approaching Finley, China Girl, and finally Oz fall after her. The four appear, moments later in gigantic floating soap bubbles, which send them flying miles away. In the distance, Oz sees and inquires about a small city encapsulated within a giant, soapy bubble.Gilda explains that the bubble is a protective barrier, which keeps out anybody with evil or malcontent in their heart. Oz, being both slightly evil and malicious himself, fears that he won't be able to get through. Glinda, Finley and China Girl easily glide through the bubble barrier, and Oz, after bouncing off the of barrier a few times, is finally able to squeak through.In Emerald City, Evanora is not pleased with Oz and Glinda escaping her grasp. She concocts a plan. She invites Theodora into her quarters and magically produces a small wooden music box identical to the one Oz gave Theodora. Theodora, upon seeing the music box, is hurt by Oz's presumed betrayal and returns to her room. She sits in front of her vanity mirror and cries. Her tears are like acid, etching permanent burns into her skin.Glinda introduces Oz to the people of the quaint city within the bubble: farmers, tinkerers, munchkins, etc. They all live in innocent, unspoilt happiness and are very excited to meet and hear from the wizard of myth and prophecy. Oz, now convinced that his rouse has gone too far takes Glinda aside and explains that he is not a real magician. He's a fake, a charlitan, an illusionist who can't perform real magic. Glinda, to Oz's surprise, admits that she knows.She knew from the moment she first met him, but just because she knows doesn't mean that the townspeople need to. With this new information, Oz puts on a show of confidence, convincing the townspeople that he is the wizard they hoped would return to destroy the Wicked Witch.Theodora's anger at Oz is at a boiling point, as is evidenced by her severely disfigured, acid-burnt face. Evanora, now in total control of Theodora convinces Theodora to follow along with her plan and become more powerful than any wizard ever. Evanora produces a small, green apple and tells Theodora that the apple will give her the power to kill Oz. She bites into the apple and soon keels over. Her skin darkens, her voice deepens, and her silhouette grows tall and evil.Theodora grabs a black brimmed hat and laughs maniacally. A mysterious storm cloud appears over Glinda and Oz's town. A red-hot light at the center of the cloud pounds against the ""impenetrable"" bubble surrounding the town. The cloud pounds against the bubble again and again until it breaks like an egg. The red-hot light beams into the city, landing like a meteor in the town square. A glowing evil figure emerges from the crater -- it's Theodora, transfigured into a green-skinned, black-suited old witch. She confronts Oz, and explains that she has become a truly Wicked Witch because of his treachery.She steals a broom from a towns person and rides away, leaving a trail of black smoke behind her. Amidst the chaos, Glinda searches for Oz, but finds that he's run off. She confronts him in his quarters, where he's quickly packing his bags for a hasty escape. Glinda tries giving Oz the confidence to believe in himself, and to look past the fact that he's not a real wizard.Through soul-searching, Oz formulates a plan. He tells Glinda to gather the town's smartest and strongest. Oz meets with the town's Master Tinker (Bill Cobbs) and his men, the appointed scientists of the city, and together they plan an illusion to trick Theodora and Evanora.Under Oz's guidance the townspeople create elaborate mechanisms for the show. Oz shows the tinkers how to create a movie projector, how to create black powder, and finally how to build a hot-air balloon. Oz asks the head Tinker to keep the balloon a secret. He and Glinda, together, form a battle plan.They look at a map of the Emerald City and its outlying areas. Oz suggests that they enter the city through the Poppy fields, but Glinda explains that the poppy fields will put anyone who breaths in their spores, into an inescapable deep sleep. Oz thinks of a way to use this to their advantage. Finally, Glinda reveals that she has a contact to get them into the city unnoticed. Knuck, AKA Sour puss, appears and reveals himself to be their inside man.The assault on Emerald City begins. Oz, along with Knuck and other munchkins, disguise themselves and sneak past an unwitting Winkie Gate Keeper (Bruce Campbell). They sneak the carriage, filled with the projection equipment and Oz's balloon, into the city.As soon as they pass through the gate, Oz separates himself from the group, with the balloon, and sneaks up to the King's vault, and begins filling the hot-air balloon's basket with gold. Down on the ground, Finley, Knuck and the Master Tinker see that Oz has betrayed them, in favor of escaping with a balloon full of gold, but continue with the plan.Out at the edge of the city Glinda casts a spell which sends thick fog across the landscape. Theodora and Evanora, distracted by the thick blanket of fog, watch as an army of soldiers stomps through the fog, toward the city. The pair of wicked witches sends out their entire army of baboons to stop the incoming force.The baboons tear-into the soldiers, but are shocked to find that they're full of hay. The fog dissipates, revealing that the soldiers are mechanical scarecrows, built by the townspeople, and to make matters worse, the fog was covering the poppy field. Almost all of the baboons fall into a deep sleep, leaving the city mostly defenceless.The townspeople disappear back into the woods as a few conscious baboons go after them. Glinda is suddenly taken hostage by a pair of them. She drops her wand into the field and is taken up into the center of the city. Evanora searches the grass for the wand, but thanks to the China Girl, is unable to find it.Evanora flies back into the city, and at its center is met by Theodora. The pair stand on either side of Glinda, who has been chained to a pair of posts. The angry citizens of Emerald City watch on in horror as Evanora and Theodora torture Glinda with green lightning and red fire attacks. Above them, Oz's balloon appears. Evanora points at the balloon, and exposes Oz as a greedy fraud, trying to escape with the town's riches instead of defending the town as the prophecy foretold.Evanora angrily shoots fire at the hot air balloon, exploding it, and sending the riches crashing down to the ground in a giant plume of black smoke. Glinda, shocked by Oz's death, cries, and prepares to die. Suddenly a booming voice echoes throughout the city and Oz's ghostly face appears on the plume of smoke. He explains that his death was necessary to become the true Wizard of Oz, and that he is now immortal and all-powerful.Evanora and Theodora are speechless. They fire lightning and fireballs into Oz's ghostly facade, but they do nothing. Secretly, Oz, Knuck, Finley, and the Master Tinker sit huddled in the caravan at the center of the city, projecting a moving image onto the black smoke, putting-on a spectacular illusion. While distracted, the China Girl sneaks Glinda her wand and manages to break her free.Upon finding Glinda gone, the townspeople turning on her, and a massive floating head in the sky, Evanora escapes into the castle, leaving Theodora to deal with the town by herself. Soon Oz, and the townspeople, rain fireworks down onto Theodora, forcing her to escape on her broom. As she trails into the distance, she promises to return and stop Oz for good.Evanora, inside the castle, is confronted by Glinda seated in her father's throne. Evanora shoots green lightning at Glinda, but Glinda deflects the attacks with her wand. The fight starts on the ground but ends in the air. Evanora grabs Glinda by the throat, and Glinda grasps at Evanora's chest. Their attacks rebound off one another and the two land, painfully, on the ground.Evanora prepares to deliver the killing blow, but lacks the magic to do so. She reaches for her neck, the emerald necklace that had been around it, the source of her power, is gone; shattered into a thousand pieces on the ground, under Glinda.Evanora suddenly keels over. Her beautiful features disappear. Her nails grow long and dirty, her skin becomes wrinkled and liver-spotted, and an old hag appears in her place. The old, true Evanora lunges at Glinda, but Glinda, with wand in hand, repels her attack and sends her flying through the castle window. She's caught by a pair of flying baboons and carried off into the night.The next morning, the Emerald City, now freed of tyranny, celebrates. Glinda walks into the throne room and is greeted by the smokey visage of Oz, hovering over the throne. Finley latches the door.China Girl and Knuck close the curtains and once the coast is clear, Master Tinker switches-off the mechanism and out steps Oz, in the flesh. As thanks for their exemplary work, Oz gives each of them a gift. To Master Tinker, he gives a Swiss-army knife, complete with a fork and spoon.To Knuck, (A.K.A.; Sour Puss), he gives a novelty mask with a smile painted on it. To Finley he gives his top hat and friendship, and to China Girl he offers themselves as her new family. Finally, to Glinda, he takes her behind the curtain and plants a giant kiss on her."

Since Kronos lies deep in Klingon territory and the Federation is on the brink of war with the Klingon Empire, the Enterprise is supplied with 72 long-range prototype photon torpedoes and is ordered to fire them at Harrison's location once he is found. Thinking that the torpedoes could be dangerous to the ship, Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott refuses to take them aboard and tenders his resignation (which Kirk accepts), whereupon Pavel Chekov is promoted to Chief Engineer. Admiral Marcus' daughter, scientist Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), joins the crew under a false identity.Arriving at the Klingon home world, the Enterprise's warp core malfunctions. With repairs underway, Kirk, Spock and Uhura use a previously commandeered trader ship to reach Kronos. After being detected by Klingon patrol ships, the three are forced to land. Despite Uhura's attempts to negotiate, the Klingons prepare to kill the trio. Harrison wipes out the Klingons in a show of superhuman strength and confronts the landing party, but surrenders after learning the precise number of photon torpedoes aimed at him.Returning to the Enterprise, Harrison reveals his real identity: Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically augmented superhuman, who has been in Cryo sleep for 300 years after his unsuccessful war to have his superhuman comrades rule the Earth. He advises Kirk to examine the 72 prototype torpedoes and also tells him a set of spatial coordinates. Kirk orders Leonard McCoy to examine the torpedoes, and contacts Scotty on Earth to check the coordinates. The torpedoes are found to each contain a genetically engineered human in Cryo sleep - the remaining members of Khan's colleagues. Khan explains that Admiral Marcus awakened him to use his superior intellect and savagery to develop advanced weapons for a war with the Klingons, keeping his colleagues as hostages. He also says that now Marcus wants to kill Khan to erase every trace of his association with a known war criminal. Kirk realizes that the Enterprise's warp core had been sabotaged on Admiral Marcus' orders, making the covert operation to kill Khan a one-way ticket.Scotty arrives at the coordinates and finds a secret Starfleet shipyard, which he infiltrates. The Enterprise's warp core is repaired, but the ship is soon confronted by an unregistered Federation battleship, the USS Vengeance - a massive vessel built for combat which dwarfs the Enterprise. Admiral Marcus reveals himself as the commander of the Vengeance, demanding Kirk hand over Khan. Kirk refuses, and the Enterprise warps toward Earth, to have Khan stand trial.In Earth's orbit, the Enterprise is attacked by the Vengeance. With the Enterprise severely damaged, Kirk offers to hand over Khan and the 72 bodies in Cryo sleep in exchange for the lives of his crew. Marcus refuses, beams his daughter to the Vengeance, and orders the destruction of the Enterprise-when the Vengeance suddenly suffers a complete power outage, caused by Scotty who had boarded the ship at the secret shipyard. As the Enterprise weapons are too damaged to continue the fight and knowing that Khan was the designer of the Vengeance, Kirk allies himself with Khan and boards the ship. They reunite with Scotty and take the bridge. Meanwhile, Spock contacts Spock Prime to learn of Khan's history and how to defeat him. Khan betrays Kirk and takes control of the Vengeance, killing Admiral Marcus. Khan negotiates with Spock, beaming Kirk and his boarding party back to the Enterprise in exchange for the 72 Cryo torpedoes.Khan plans to destroy the Enterprise, but Spock reveals that real - and armed - torpedoes were beamed to the Vengeance, keeping the Cryo pods on the Enterprise. The torpedoes incapacitate the Vengeance and anger Khan, who believes that his 72 colleagues have been killed. Both ships start descending towards Earth's surface. At the cost of his life, Kirk re-aligns the warp core, enabling the crew to regain control of the Enterprise. The Vengeance crashes into downtown San Francisco but does not kill Khan. Khan tries to escape in the chaos but is pursued by Spock. McCoy discovers that Khan's blood may reanimate Kirk and Uhura prevents Spock from killing Khan, capturing him instead.In the aftermath, Kirk is revived and returns to duty as Captain of the Enterprise. Khan is sealed into his Cryo pod and stored away with the rest of his crew. As the film ends, a restored Enterprise is re-christened and departs for a 5-year mission of exploration."

Thousands of years ago, a race of beings known as Dark Elves tried to send the universe into darkness by using a weapon known as the Aether. Warriors from Asgard stopped them, but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escaped to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether, and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth, but his father, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some Policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown.—rcs0411@yahoo.com There are nine realms of Asgard, and once every five thousand years, they align. Earth happens to be one of these realms. These realms create portals between the worlds during the alignment which is called ""Convergence"". On Earth, in London, England, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) believes she and her crew have discovered one such portal. Foster, while investigating the phenomenon, is transported to another realm and comes in contact with a substance called the Aether. Upon coming into contact with the substance, it draws Thor (Chris Hemsworth) from Asgard back to Earth. Thor takes Jane to Asgard to be cured from the Aether. Unfortunately, in doing so, it draws more than just Jane to that world. Another being called Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) wants to use the Aether to destroy Asgard.

Thor forms an uneasy alliance with his nemesis Loki to save Jane, stop Malekith, and save the Nine Realms from total chaos and darkness.—ahmetkozan Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns to do battle with Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), the vengeful leader of a primordial race that seeks to destroy the Nine Realms, in this big-budget comic book adventure set after the events of Marvel's The Avengers (2012). With even Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) unable to protect Asgard from the approaching darkness, the god of thunder reunites with Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and prepares to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to save the world from certain destruction. Eons ago, Bor, the father of Odin, clashes with the Dark Elf Malekith, who seeks to destroy the universe using a weapon known as the Aether. After conquering Malekith's forces, including enhanced warriors called the Kursed, on their home world of Svartalfheim, Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column. Unbeknownst to him, Malekith, his lieutenant Algrim, and a handful of Dark Elves escape into suspended animation.In present-day Asgard, Loki stands imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth. Meanwhile, Thor, alongside warriors Fandral, Volstagg and Sif repel marauders on Vanaheim, home of their comrade Hogun; it is the final battle in a war to pacify the Nine Realms following the reconstruction of Bifröst, the ""Rainbow Bridge"" between realms, which had been destroyed two years earlier. In London, astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster's intern, Darcy Lewis, now with her own intern, Ian, takes Jane to an abandoned factory where objects have begun to disobey the laws of physics and disappear into thin air. Separating from the group, Jane is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether.The Asgardians learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random. Heimdall alerts Thor of Jane's recent disappearance, leading Thor to search for her. When she inadvertently releases an unearthly force while being arrested by the police for trespassing on private property, he takes her to Asgard. However, the Asgardian healers say they do not know how to treat her. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns Jane's infection will kill her given enough time, and that the Aether's return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.Malekith, awakened by the Aether's release, turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Jane, knowing she contains the Aether. When they fail to capture her, they escape, but not before killing Thor's mother Frigga in a swordfight.

With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor and Loki commandeer a Dark Elf spaceship and escape to Svartalfheim with Jane.On Svartalfheim, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane. However, Thor's attempt to destroy the substance fails, and the Aether-empowered Malekith leaves with his ship as Loki appears to be fatally wounded while protecting Thor from Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Following Loki's apparent death, Thor and Jane discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite with Jane's mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, Darcy and Ian in London.There, they learn that Malekith plans to unleash the Aether to destroy the universe, and that he will do this in Greenwich, the center of the Convergence.

World War Z,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816711/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Former United Nations employee Gerry Lane traverses the world in a race against time to stop a zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments and threatens to destroy humanity itself. Life for former United Nations investigator Gerry Lane and his family seems content. Suddenly, the world is plagued by a mysterious infection turning whole human populations into rampaging mindless zombies. After barely escaping the chaos, Lane is persuaded to go on a mission to investigate this disease. What follows is a perilous trek around the world where Lane must brave horrific dangers and long odds to find answers before human civilization falls.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) When former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane and his family get stuck in urban gridlock, he senses that it's no ordinary traffic jam. His suspicions are confirmed when, suddenly, the city erupts into chaos. A lethal virus, spread through a single bite, is turning healthy people into something vicious, unthinking and feral. As the pandemic threatens to consume humanity, Gerry leads a worldwide search to find the source of the infection and, with luck, a halt to it's spread.—ahmetkozan A virulent and unprecedented pandemic of global proportions which turns humans into rabid flesh-eating zombies takes the world by surprise. Under these circumstances, the retired United Nations special agent, Gerry Lane, must leave behind a peaceful family life, a wife and two daughters, to escort a team of scientists on a mission to find a cure, navigating through zombie-swarmed cities. However, as the deadly pathogen obliterates entire areas, incessantly giving birth to diseased masses of freshly-reanimated undead, the frail hope of finding a viable solution starts drifting away. Does humanity have enough time to wait for a miracle?—Nick Riganas Having retired as U.N. investigator, Gerry Lane devotes his time to wife Karin and their wining brat daughter Constance and Rachel in Philadelphia, until it becomes the next site of a globally spreading mystery epidemic turning bitten people into rabies-like zombies. His clueless former chief, deputy secretary general Thierry Umutoni, recalls him to the UN emergency team, thus offering the whole family a spot aboard the safe air carrier. Gerry joins though army veterans on reconnaissance to Korea, where a rogue CIA agent's suggestion proves worthless, then to Israel, where a Mossad 'contrarious tenth man' had the foresight to respond to a vague Indian pandemic threat by erecting a wall Jerusalem, only to see an undead flood overtake it. His last minute escape flight must deal drastically with an infected passenger before crashing in Cardiff, near a WHO research facility, where he combines and tests a daring out of the box 'camouflage' strategy inspired by weir observations.—KGF Vissers Former UN employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters, Rachel and Constance, wake and enjoy a family breakfast. Gerry tells Constance, the youngest daughter, that he quit his job to spend more time with the family. On the TV is some news about strife and talk of martial law. Later, they sit in heavy Philadelphia traffic when the city is attacked by a horde of zombies -- these attackers move very quickly, biting people and the bitten being turned very rapidly. The Lanes are in a car crash during the panic stampede and Gerry notices it takes approximately 12 seconds for a bitten person to change.As the chaos spreads, the Lanes escape from the city in a stolen RV. They stop near Newark, New Jersey at a large food store where Karin stocks up on whatever food she can scrounge and Gerry is able to find medication when his eldest daughter, Rachel, who is suffering from a violent asthma attack as a result of the shock and stress of what happened to them. His wife is attacked by looters -- Gerry shoots one of them and Karin is let go. For a brief moment, it looks as though a police officer might arrest Jerry despite his holding the rifle over his head but the officer is simply looking for supplies himself.Outside the store the family takes refuge in an apartment complex in Newark. Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena) - an old friend of Gerry's - calls and tells the family that he is sending a helicopter to rescue them, however it will take until the next morning to arrive. The Lanes hide out in a small apartment with a Latino family. One of the children, a boy named Tomas, speaks English and translates for the Lanes. Gerry, believing that the best chance of survival is to keep moving, is unable to convince Tomas' family to leave with them.The next morning, the Lanes creep through the mostly abandoned tenement trying to find the roof but the undead detect them and they are chased to the roof. They find Tomas on the way. When Gerry is attacked by several zombies, they spew blood on him. Arriving on the roof, Gerry steps to the edge, ready to throw himself off if the blood spilled on his face makes him turn. He doesn't and, after holding off another horde of the undead, the family boards the chopper and escapes. The helicopter takes the Lanes to a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier off the coast of New York City with a whole group of other refugees. On board, there is team of scientists and military personnel are analyzing the scope of the worldwide outbreak. Thierry is waiting there for them and fixes them up with bunks.A virologist, Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel), argues that the plague is a virus, whose origin must be found in order for a vaccine to be developed. Because of his expertise as a former UN investigator, Gerry is tasked with helping Fassbach find the outbreak's source. Gerry reluctantly agrees to help, on given the word that his family will be safe, and is sent to Camp Humphreys, a military base in South Korea, where an email was received about 11 days prior that stated that the outbreak may have started there.Moments after arriving at the base, Gerry's team is attacked by zombies. The frightened and cowardly Fassbach is killed after accidentally shooting himself after slipping on the ramp of the C-130 plane. The gunshot alerts the zombies roaming the area, forcing Gerry and the crew to run. After being rescued by the base's surviving personnel, Gerry learns that the zombies are attracted to noise. The soldiers on the base, lead by Captain Speke, explain that a Korean soldier had been out in the field doing research when he was attacked and turned. His conversion took considerably more time than what had been witnessed more recently. The corpse of the infected man attacked the base doctor and both were incinerated. Speke tells Gerry how one of his men was able to stand in the middle of the infected people and not be attacked. When Gerry asks the soldier, who walks with a slight limp, how he injured his leg, the soldier tells him something's been bothering him lately.Gerry talks to a Ex-CIA agent, Haffner (David Morse), who'd been arrested for selling arms to North Korea. He tells Gerry a chilling account of how the North Korea government was able to contain the outbreak in their country by pulling the teeth of every citizen within a 24 hour period, giving its citizens no way to infect each other through bites.Haffner tells Gerry to go to Jerusalem, where the Israeli Mossad had established a safe zone just before the outbreak was officially acknowledged, implying Israel might have had prior knowledge of what was to come. To get the C-130 refueled and Gerry aboard, Speke's men ride in a fleet of bicycles to avoid making any noise. Gerry's satellite phone goes off when Karin tries to call him and the undead attack. The plane is refueled successfully and Gerry and the C-130 pilot manage to escape.In Jerusalem, Gerry meets Mossad leader Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken), who explains that the Mossad had months earlier intercepted communications from an Army General in India, who stated that Indian troops were fighting the ""rakshasa"", or ""dead spirits"". Warmbrunn also explains how the center of Jerusalem was walled in -- the wall is formidable, at least 50 feet high and refugees are being brought in to the quarantine zone, including non-Jews and Muslims. While Gerry talks with Jurgen, a group of Muslim refugees begin to sing joyously at finding a safe zone to survive in. One of the women is able to find a microphone and the singing grows louder. Attracted to the singing, the zombies outside begin to climb the protective wall forming a massive pile that eventually succeeds in entering the city. While fleeing, Gerry notices that an old man and an emaciated boy are ignored by the zombies. A young Israeli woman soldier, Segen (Daniella Kertesz), Gerry's escort, is bitten by a zombie. Gerry quickly amputates her hand to stop the spread of the infection, counting to 12 until he's sure that she won't turn. Gerry and Segen eventually make it to the airport and manage to board a Belarus Airways airliner after Gerry's pilot panics and flies away.Contacting Thierry, Gerry asks for the nearest WHO or CDC type lab, they are diverted to a WHO research facility in Cardiff, Wales. While in the air, a stowaway zombie is released from the cargo hold and attacks a flight attendant. She attacks the rest of the passengers. The plane crashes near Cardiff after Gerry detonates a grenade to kill the zombies. Segen and Gerry proceed as the only apparent survivors of the crash, Gerry has been impaled by a chunk of metal. Segen finds him and they walk to Cardiff and find the WHO facility. Out of contact, the US Navy assumes he is dead and deports his family to Nova Scotia.After arriving at the facility, Gerry passes out at the gate and awakes three days later strapped to a gurney -- his wound has been treated and bandaged. He is able to convince the staff of the facility that he's there on a specific mission -- the men watching him call his wife's satellite phone. Thierry answers the phone and tells Gerry that his family were considered ""non-essential"" personnel and were relocated to a land-based facility. Gerry is upset but Thierry is able to verify Gerry's identity to the suspicious WHO staff.Gerry reveals a theory to the wary scientists that since the old man and the sickly boy in Jerusalem were ignored (as well as a homeless wino Gerry briefly witnessed in Newark that the zombies bypassed, and the story the soldier with a limp told about the zombies ignoring him), the infected do not bite people who are seriously injured or already terminally ill, since they would be unsuitable as hosts for viral reproduction. He volunteers to inject himself with a terminal but curable pathogen to see if his idea works. However, the wing of the building in which the pathogens are stored was overrun by zombies after a doctor accidentally infected himself. Gerry decides to retrieve a pathogen regardless, while Segen and one of the WHO doctors follow him for backup. They fight their way through the zombies, and Gerry finally gets to the pathogen vault.Inside, Gerry fills a small box with vials of pathogens from two separate cabinets. The scientists watch him on camera, remarking that the left cabinet contains deadly and incurable diseases. Gerry gets ready to leave and sees one of the undead doctors outside. Cornered and without a suitable weapon, he decides to inject himself to see if his theory will work. He shows the scientists a note saying ""TELL MY FAMILY I LOVE THEM"" and chooses a vial at random from the box. Gerry waits a short time and opens the door to the vault. The former doctor ignores him and Gerry is able to walk out, past the horde of zombies that have infested the facility.After he makes it back to the safe part of the facility, everyone rejoices at his theory's success, and the doctors cure him of the pathogen. Gerry returns to his family, in a safe zone in Freeport, Nova Scotia.A ""vaccine"" derived from deadly pathogens is developed that can act as camouflage for the troops battling the infected. Air drops are performed, delivering the pathogen to all parts of the world. Human offensives begin against the zombies, and hope is restored. Russia is particularly successful in halting the pandemic with military and civilian force. Gerry comments, ""This isn't the end. Not even close."""

""The Croods"" are an eccentric family of cavemen, who survive the harsh terrain by living accordingly to a strict set of rules. But when their home is destroyed in the wake of an impending disaster known as ""The End"", they are forced to leave their home of shelter and security, and into the wilderness of the unknown to find a new home.—DreamWorks Animation The Neanderthal family the Croods lives in a cave, protected by the father Grug in accordance with the rules of survival that he has learned. His teenage daughter, Eep, is teen-aged rebellious and questions why the family lives in the dark. One night, Eep sees light and finds a Homosapien, Guy, who can control fire, is intelligent, and tells the family their World will end. When their cave collapses, Eep seeks out Guy to follow him to the new world. But the stubborn Grug does not accept the change of rules and wants to find another cave to protect his family.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Meet the Croods, the only caveman family still alive because they think new discoveries are dangerous. One night, their oldest child, Eep (stone), sneaks out and meets Guy (Reynolds), an inventive person who knows things the others don't. Later, in the morning, their cave is crushed by what he calls ""The End"". Grug (cage), Eep's father, is sad their cave is gone. Now they need to figure out how to survive with the help of Guy in a new set of open land. Yearning to explore the great outdoors and see firsthand what lies beyond their rocky cave, the prehistoric teenage cave-girl, Eep, is the first in the large Croods family who thirsts for adventure. However, when her overprotective but well-meaning father, Grug, who believes that there's no safer place than their cave, sees their home fall apart, the Croods will have no other choice but to run for their lives in the dangerous Palaeolithic landscapes for the first time in their lives. Under those grave circumstances, only a confident cave-teen named Guy seems to know something about the impending global catastrophe; but, will Grug, and the rest of the family, believe him? In the end, will the Croods find a new place to call home?—Nick Riganas Eep (Emma Stone) is a girl in a family of cavemen living and hunting in pre-historic times. Her family is one of the few to survive, mainly due to the strict rules of her overprotective father, Grug (Nicolas Cage). In their cave home, Grug tells a story to the family, which includes his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), his daughter Sandy, his son Thunk (Clark Duke), and his mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). He uses the story of a character who mirrors Eep's curious nature to warn the family that exploration and 'new things' pose a threat to their survival, and says to never not be afraid. This irritates the bored and adventurous Eep, and after the family falls asleep, she leaves the cave, against her father's advice, when she sees a light moving outside.Seeking the light's source, she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a clever and inventive caveboy. She at first attacks him but then becomes fascinated with the fire he creates and is eager to learn more. He tells her about his theory that the world is reaching its 'end' and asks her to join him. She refuses and Guy leaves, but not before giving her a noise-making shell to call him if she needs help. Eep is then caught by Grug (who had been searching for her), and is later grounded for what she had done. Grug brings Eep home and is joined by the rest of the family. Eep tells them about Guy and shows them the shell given to her, only for them to destroy it in fear of 'new things'. An earthquake then occurs, sending everyone running for the cave, only to be stopped by Grug moments before the cave is destroyed by falling rocks. They climb over the wreckage to discover a land with lush vegetation, much different from their usual surroundings of rocky terrain. Grug takes his family into the forest to find a new cave.The family is chased by a ""Macawnivore"" (a large, macaw-colored machairodont later called ""Chunky"") and attacked by a swarm of ""Piranhakeets"" (deadly red-feathered, piranha-like birds). In panic, Eep finds and sounds a horn similar to that which Guy gave her. Guy hears this and rushes to her. Thinking quickly, he creates a torch of fire, which scares the birds away. The other Croods are captivated by the fire, having never seen it before. They steal Guy's torch and accidentally set the land around them in flames. Some giant corn is also lit, which rockets up to the sky, prompting a display of ""fireworks"" as the kernels explode. After feeling impressed by Guy's intelligence and 'ideas', Grug bottles him in a hollow log to carry him in, then suggests that they take solitude in the cave of a nearby mountain mentioned by Guy. Guy is forcibly persuaded to lead the way and learns of the Croods' way of living, which he thinks of as unusual.After an unsuccessful hunting attempt, Guy, his ""pet"" sloth Belt (Chris Sanders), and Eep build a puppet to fool and lure nearby Turkey-Fish. After they make their capture, the family greedily devours everything they caught. Grug then tells another of his morale-lowering tales, this time mirroring the events of their day. Guy then tells a story of his own about a paradise he calls ""Tomorrow"".The next day, the family reaches a path coated in spiked rock which Grug, Thunk, and Gran get pricked upon trying to cross them. A freed Guy tries to flee but then presents one of his inventions called shoes making some out of all the resources he can find for each family member. This gains him some respect from the others except for Grug, who feels jealous of Guy's cleverness. After Guy's ideas help the Croods on their journey, the family members gain something. Ugga, Gran, and Sandy have their first idea to get past carnivorous plants by hiding under flower heads as they pass, Thunk encounters and befriends a crocodile-like dog he calls Douglas, and Eep and Guy grow closer while Grug is stranded in a ravine forcing Ugga to go back for him. The next day, Grug shows the others some of his ideas (like a see-saw, shades made out of wood, and a snapshot that involves the family being slammed with a flat rock) which fail and humiliate him. They soon reach the mountain where Grug is unable to convince the family that settling in a nearby cave is a better option. Angry, he attacks Guy. The two become stuck in tar and Guy reveals his family died drowning in a tar pool and their last words inspired his traditions of ""Tomorrow."" Grug has a change of heart; he and Guy trick Chunky into freeing them by pretending to be a female ""Macawnivore"" in trouble.As they are about to reach their destination, an earthquake opens a deep ravine in their path. Grug throws each of them across the gap and reconciles with Eep while creating the first hug with her. Grug then throws her across the ravine and is left behind. He takes shelter in a cave and makes a torch. After seeing a blank rock face, he paints a large cave-drawing of the Croods and Guy together. He then encounters Chunky, who attacks him until Grug's torch is accidentally blown out, panicking them both. The frightened Chunky lies near Grug for comfort, who then has his first good idea. Using a bigger torch and a large skeletal rib cage, Grug manages to lure the Piranhakeets into transporting himself, Chunky, Douglas, and several other animals across the ravine, barely escaping the oncoming destruction. Afterwards, Grug shares the ""hug"" when he embraces his daughter again, followed by the Croods inventing the group hug.The family discovers that they have found an ocean-like area where the sun goes down over the sea. Grug and his family - including Guy, Chunky, Belt, Douglas and all their various pets - settle down in this paradise-like environment. He stops being so over-protective; as a result the family becomes more adventurous, bringing happiness to them all."

Once in Boston, she is partnered with Shannon Mullins, a skilled but foulmouthed and rebellious police officer with the Boston Police Department. Ashburn's by-the-book philosophy clashes with Mullins' rugged and violent style of police work. Mullins discovers the details of the Larkin case by stealing the case file from Ashburn and insists on helping her. Ashburn reluctantly agrees, realizing that she needs Mullins' knowledge of the local area.Ashburn and Mullins follow leads to a local night club owner and successfully place a bug on his cell phone. As they leave the club, Ashburn and Mullins are confronted by two DEA agents, Craig and Adam, who have been working the Larkin case for several months and are worried that their case will be compromised. After viewing him on a screen in the DEA agents' surveillance van, Ashburn discovers that Mullins' brother, Jason, was recently released from prison, having been put there by Mullins herself, and may be connected to Larkin's organization. Ashburn convinces Mullins to go to her parents' home to ask Jason for information on Larkin. On their arrival at the home, it becomes apparent that Mullins' parents and two other brothers still harbor deep resentment for Mullins' involvement in Jason's incarceration. Jason, who does not have any ill feelings toward his sister, tips her off about the body of a murdered drug dealer hidden in an abandoned car. Upon examination of the body, chemicals on the victim's shoes lead Ashburn and Mullins to an abandoned paint factory, where they witness a drug dealer being murdered by a member of Larkin's organization named Julian. The two apprehend Julian and interrogate him regarding Larkin, but are unable to extract any substantial information regarding Larkin's whereabouts.The pair spends the evening in a bar bonding over several rounds of drinks. After a night of raucous drinking and partying, Ashburn wakes up the following morning to discover that, in her drunkenness, she has given her car keys to one of the bar patrons. After unsuccessfully pleading for the keys, Ashburn watches, along with Mullins, as the car explodes upon being started, having been fitted with a bomb. During the investigation of the explosion, the two discover that Julian has escaped from custody and may mean to harm Mullins' family. Mullins moves the family into a motel, but learns that Jason has joined with the Larkin organization in an attempt to aid the case. Jason gives her a tip about a drug shipment coming in to Boston Harbor. The FBI sets up a sting at the harbor to take down the shipment, but discovers that the ship they have been waiting for is actually only a pleasure cruise ship and Jason has been set up by Larkin. Knowing that he informed the FBI about the supposed drug shipment, Larkin attempts to have Jason killed, but only puts him into a coma.Mullins vows to bring her brother's attacker to justice. Ashburn and Mullins learn of a warehouse where Larkin houses his operations. After equipping themselves with assault equipment from Mullins' extensive personal arsenal, the two infiltrate the warehouse. Despite taking out several of Larkin's men with a hand grenade, the two women are captured and bound by Julian, who threatens to torture them with knives. Julian is called away by Larkin, but before he leaves the room, he stabs Ashburn in the leg with one of the knives. Mullins removes the knife from Ashburn's leg and uses it to cut the rope binding her hands. Before she can finish freeing herself and Ashburn, they are discovered by Craig and Adam. Craig begins to untie the two women, but is shot and killed by Adam. Ashburn and Mullins deduce that Adam is actually Larkin, having been working his own case from inside the DEA for several months. Julian reenters and is instructed by Larkin to kill Ashburn and Mullins while he goes to the hospital to kill Jason. After Larkin leaves, Mullins, whose hands have already been untied, manages to finish freeing herself and Ashburn incapacitates Julian with a head butt. Mullins then frees Ashburn and the two race to the hospital to save Jason.Upon their arrival, Mullins rushes to find Jason. Ashburn, hindered by the stab wound in her leg, is unable to move quickly. Mullins finds Jason's room, only to discover Larkin standing over his bed with a syringe, intending to kill Jason by injecting air into his vein, causing his death by an air embolism. Mullins drops her weapon in an attempt to save her brother's life. Ashburn, having had to crawl to the room, then enters and subdues Larkin by shooting him in the genitals. With Larkin captured, Ashburn requests to stay in the FBI's Boston field office, having developed a strong friendship with Mullins. Jason is shown having fully recovered from his coma. The film ends with Mullins receiving a commendation from the Boston Police Department, with her family present cheering for her, having reconciled with her.Afterwards, following a misunderstanding earlier in the film, Mullins brings Ashburn her neighbor's cat, after believing that it was hers from a picture in her house."

After being robbed of a week's take, small-time pot dealer David is forced by his boss to go to Mexico to pick up a load of marijuana. In order to improve his odds of making it past the border, David asks the broke stripper Rose and two local teenagers to join him and pretend they're on a family holiday.—Peter Brandt Nielsen A pot dealer gets his drug money stolen by a street thug, and now he has to create a fake family in order to bring a huge shipment of weed from Mexico to the US. The drug dealer hires Rose, a stripper, for ""drug smuggling"". In the red, she accedes to the plan to pose as the wife to go in the black. He also recruits two teenagers to pose as children. Now, he must get past customs and hilarious encounters, especially with a real family.—gamergcfan If you're a soccer mom in search of some reefer, David Burke (Sudeikis) is just the man to talk to. He certainly isn't the biggest dealer in town, but he's discreet, and aims to please. When David attempts to perform a good deed and gets robbed in the process, however, his supplier Brad (Ed Helms) is none too happy. Now, in order to pay Brad back before the hammer drops, David must retrieve a big drug shipment from Mexico and sneak back across the border undetected. It's a risky job for sure, but with the help of a few neighbors David might just pull it off. With sardonic stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) assuming the role of housewife, teenage misfit Kenny (Will Poulter) posing as the awkward son, and rebellious Casey (Emma Roberts) filling in as his sister, David slips on some khakis, and starts heading south. Meanwhile, as David tries to convince himself that the border patrol wouldn't give a second glance at such a typical suburban family, the shipment -- and the stakes -- both prove greater than anticipated. Low level marijuana drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed of his money and stash, some of which he owes to his supplier. His boss, wealthy drug lord Brad Gurdlinger forces David to smuggle marijuana from Mexico in order to clear his debt. Realizing that one man attempting to get through customs is too suspicious, he hires a stripper stage-named Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a runaway teenage girl and thief named Casey, and his 18 year-old neighbor Kenny to pose as a bogus family called the ""Millers"".Because of the extra load of the marijuana on the RV, one of the radiator hoses breaks while going up a steep incline. A family they had encountered at the border called the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don, Edie, and Melissa, catch up to them and tow the Millers' RV to a repair shop. On the trip to the shop, David learns that Don Fitzgerald is a DEA agent after finding his badge and gun in the glove compartment.The marijuana turns out to be stolen from Pablo Chacon's cartel. The next day, when the Millers head to the shop to pick up the RV, Chacon and his henchman One Eye are waiting for them and prepare to execute the family. They immediately tell Chacon that they aren't a real family and that they didn't know they were stealing from him. Rose is given a chance to prove that she is a stripper by dancing, and when she gets close, turns a steam vent onto Chacon.The Millers then escape in the RV, with Kenny behind the wheel. Due to Kenny's erratic driving, the RV veers off the highway and a tarantula, hiding in a bowl of fruit given to them when they picked up the marijuana, crawls up Kenny's leg and bites his testicle. As Kenny has a severe allergic reaction to the bite, the Millers head to the hospital. This further delays the delivery of the contraband, but David re-negotiates with Gurdlinger for a fee of $500,000. When Kenny is finally released, David rushes him to the RV in a wheelchair and tips him over. David inadvertently reveals how much he is getting paid, in comparison to how little he offered to pay each of the others. Casey, Rose, and Kenny are left in disgust by the revelation, and so David leaves them at the local carnival.David regrets abandoning them and returns to the carnival, begging them on his knees to come back with him. On their way back to the RV, One Eye discovers them and as he is about to shoot everyone, Don Fitzgerald comes out of the camper and subdues him. Chacon then comes around the corner and is about to kill them all, but David hits Chacon and he drops his gun. Rose picks it up and accidentally shoots Chacon in the shoulder and as he is recovering, Kenny punches Chacon and knocks him out.Don arrests Chacon and One Eye and tells the Millers that he will arrest them too, but actually gives them the opportunity to leave. David delivers the drugs to Gurdlinger who tells him he's late and that their deal is off. DEA agents then crash into the room, arresting Gurdlinger. The agent in charge is Don, who tells David that he will have to be in the witness protection program until Gurdlinger's trial. He then adds that anyone that was a witness to the crime will be in protection, and David smiles. The Millers are then seen together in a beautiful home, with several marijuana plants growing in the garden."
American Hustle,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1800241/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A con man, Irving Rosenfeld, along with his seductive partner Sydney Prosser, is forced to work for a wild F.B.I. Agent, Richie DiMaso, who pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and the Mafia. A fictional film set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation, American Hustle tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting.Jeremy Renneris Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down.—Sony Pictures Entertainment 1978. When Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser meet, there is an instant emotional connection since they can see themselves in the other, in what each wants in life. Both come from humble backgrounds, but are striving for a better life. They embark on a sexual relationship, despite Irving already being married to the brash and uncultured Rosalyn Rosenfeld; most likely he does not divorce her due to his affection for her son, Danny Rosenfeld (whom he has adopted), whom he would not want left alone with his largely unfit mother. Irving tells Sydney about his illegal sideline as a con artist, but to his surprise she is not repulsed but rather attracted to the fact (besides his legitimate businesses, he deals in loan scams which net him $5,000 each). Sydney believes she can help his scams by pretending to be British Lady Edith Greensley who has London banking connections. In doing so, she does indeed vastly improve the scams and their take. However, one of their targets ends up being Richie DiMaso, a low level FBI agent trying to make his mark in the agency. Richie knows that Sydney is not a Lady nor does she have London banking connections but he does believe she is a Brit named Edith Greensley. Richie makes a deal with them to help him nab four additional white collar criminals in exchange for their release without charges. Ultimately, Richie talks them into bigger fish than was originally intended: nabbing politicians and mobsters as the opportunity arises. Their initial target is a Camden, New Jersey Mayor called Carmine Polito, who is trying to revitalize Atlantic City as a gambling mecca, which requires an influx of investments in the millions. But in getting these offshore investments (which in reality don't exist), the bigger fish include congressmen and senators, who may be taking bribes in this revitalization, as well as a mobster named Victor Tellegio, the right hand man ofMeyer Lansky. Beyond their marks' finding out what they're doing -which could be especially deadly in Tellegio's case- their collective problems include: Stoddard Thorsen, Richie's immediate supervisor, who repeatedly refuses Richie's expensive requests for the wherewithal to complete the sting convincingly; Rosalyn, whose own self-interest is her primary focus, even at the possible risk of Irving's life; and Sydney's relationship with Richie, whom she initially seduces to keep him close ""just in case"", but with whom she may really be falling in love.—Huggo Con man, Irving Rosenfeld engages in an affair with Sydney Prosser, a charming con artist, and is forced by an FBI agent to devise an extravagant scheme to hustle corrupt politicians, including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey, as well as the mafia, while his eccentric wife is desperate for his love.—Camden Francis Smooth-talking Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) is a hustler of the highest order. No mark is off limits for Rosenfeld, especially when his crafty partner Sydney Prosser (Adams) is by his side. When renegade FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper) thrusts the deceptive duo into the treacherous world of New Jersey power players and underworld heavies, the thrill of the hunt grows too strong to resist. Meanwhile, New Jersey politician Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) gets caught in the middle, and Rosenfeld's capricious wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) holds more power than anyone could imagine.. The movie starts with a 70s Technicolor logo of Columbia Pictures, Atlas Entertainment, and Annapurna Pictures.A title caption reads that the following is loosely based on a true story.April 28, 1978:In a suite in the Plaza Hotel in New York City, a fat Jewish man named Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is elaborately fixing his hair in a comb over to hide a huge balding spot on his head. This goes on for several minutes. He finally hairsprays it in place. Irving leaves his room and walks into an adjacent hotel room where a surveillance team is recording the video and audio of another room. Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) enters and exchanges an angry look with Irving. It is broken up by the entrance of Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who begins arguing with Irving, saying he got them a suite at the Plaza Hotel and mentions that he's never touched Sydney (there is obviously some jealousy between Irving and Richie over her). As Richie and Irving quarrel, Richie messes up his comb over, leaving the hairpiece sticking straight up. Sydney, in her British dialect, rushes to fix it.The three walk into a hotel room on the same floor and put on friendly faces. They are meeting Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). Richie has a briefcase at his feet and tries to push it towards the mayor. The mayor's associate, Carl Elway, notices and tells him he'll handle it and Richie rambles that it would be disrespectful to ""the sheikh"" if Polito doesn't take it. Carmine becomes suspicious, saying he came to meet a sheikh but the fact that a briefcase is being forced on him is freaking him out and he decides to leave. Richie and Irving begin fighting again with Irving finally agreeing to ""mop up"" the mess Richie caused by being dumb and sliding the briefcase conspicuously.We now go back in time several years and explore the events that will lead up to this meeting.In his childhood, Irving narrates that his father owned a glass business and Irving notices him being taken advantage of by customers. It convinces him to drum up business for his dad by breaking glass windows in the area with a baseball bat. As an adult, Irving also owns a glass business... as well as a bunch of dry cleaners. At a pool party, Irving meets a nice red-haired girl in a fur coat named Sydney Prosser, who speaks with an American accent. When Irving notices her bracelet has Duke Ellington's picture on it, they bond over their love of the jazz musician. They go upstairs and play one of his records, and Irving's confidence attracts her. Irving and Sydney have a lot in common because she comes from a background of limited options (such as a stint as a stripper). Sydney professes that she is a bold person, and Irving praises Sydney's ability to reinvent herself.Sydney has recently started working at Cosmopolitan Magazine. Irving knows she is too smart to work at a clerical job. She is broke and fearless with nothing to lose; her dream has been to become anyone else other than who she was. So she thinks nothing of going with Irving as he shows her one of her dry cleaning stores. He takes her to the back where things that were left behind or forgotten are stored; they try on various clothes and end up kissing between the dry cleaning conveyors.A few days later, Irving shows Sydney his office where there are tons of paintings on display. He tells her that his new business helps guys get loans who can't get loans. When he hesitates upon being asked how he gets them money, she realizes he is a con artist, who takes his clients' $5,000 fee but makes no effort to pay them back. He defends himself by saying the guys that are desperate to invest with him are people at the bottom with gambling problems and embezzling. She points out he takes advantage of desperate people, and he asks if she wants to join him. She walks off without saying anything, exiting the office. Irving goes back to his desk, upset that he has crossed a line with a woman he genuinely likes. Moments later, though, she returns, this time using a British accent, introducing herself as ""Lady Edith Greensly"", who has royal banking connections in London.From this point on, Irving and Sydney become partners. The scheme is simple: Sydney tells new acquaintances that she has London banking connections, so their husbands will overhear and beg her to let them invest with Irving. To hook them, she refuses to help out, making them more eager to connect with Irving. One by one, people come to Irving's desk; Sydney (under her alias Edith) and Irving convince everyone that they are selective so all of the desperate men end up begging for Irving to take their $5,000 in hopes of a $50,000 in return. Irving's business triples due to Sydney's close attention to detail. They also sell art on the side. All of the paintings are forgeries, but with the British Lady Edith Greensly alias helping sell them as authentic, each one is sold.Due to their success, they rent out a better office, calling it London Associates (in honor of Sydney's fake accent). The two fall in love with each other, go dancing, have sex, and more. In voice-over, Irving admits we're all conning ourselves to get through life, leaving out the ugly truth in his case. In fact, he's currently married and has adopted his wife's son (from another man) who he loves as his own.In his Long Island home, Irving comes home where he talks to his young son, Danny, who tells him that his mom was late picking him up from school, and that a sun lamp caught on fire that afternoon while she was drinking. His shrew and alcoholic wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) is defending herself, saying she put out the fire. The left side of her face is completely red with burns. They quarrel and she hilariously defends herself every time he criticizes her, blaming sun lamps for being dangerous and saying it probably happens all the time. He tells her he's not happy, and she takes a moment and says that he can't divorce her because then she just might take Danny and never let Irving see him again. She says nobody in her family has ever gotten a divorce and she won't be the first; and points out that they fight and fuck and that's their thing. In voice-over, he says she was the Picasso of passive-aggressive and was better than any con artist. Meanwhile, Rosalyn strips down to her underwear and seduces Irving, to get him to forget he is angry with her.Sydney and Irving's operation goes perfectly, until they try to scam someone else out of their $5,000. Their victim ultimately is Richie, whom we met at the beginning of the film. He mentions that Lady Edith had done a good job convincing him to come in over their two lunches. Irving gets jealous as they reminisce about their outings together; it is obvious she really had a fun time with him versus just trying to con him. Richie holds out his $5,000 check, but now Irving is suspicious. Sydney finally takes the check instead. When the two try to sneak out of the office, they run into undercover cops. Because Irving didn't take the money, Richie can't arrest him, but Sydney is arrested for fraud, because she is not British nobility and has no banking connections. Richie shows off his badge, revealing that he's an FBI agent.Sydney is taken to an interrogation room where she is incarcerated there for three days. Only Richie is allowed to communicate with her. She goes stir crazy given that her cell has no furniture. Richie tells her that Irving is taking advantage of her and puts it in her head that Irving is loyal to his wife and son and that she is being fooled; he uses the fact that Irving has not come visit her as proof that he doesn't really care about her (when in truth, Irving has been forbidden to see her). Richie concludes the conversation by revealing that he has a romantic interest in her; the entire time, she remains speechless so he still thinks she is British and named Edith Greensly.On the third day, Irving is looking through the glass at the jail cell with Sydney oblivious to him from the other side. Richie talks to Irving about his dishonesty, and then explains that he wants to combat white-collar crime and can, with Irving's help. He wants Irving to help him trap four similar con artists and if he does, Sydney and he will be free of all charges.Now back home at her Manhattan apartment, Sydney suggests to Irving and they both flee the country to Romania, but Irving refuses because he doesn't want to leave Danny behind. She becomes accusatory, because Richie has planted it in her head that Irving is just using her and doesn't care about her. She finally agrees to help entrap four con artists to clear their names and tells Irving that she is going to get romantically close to Richie in case they need him in the future.Irving, Sydney, and Richie are in an art gallery with an Arab sheikh. Irving is rude to Richie but Sydney defends him. Irving explains their plan by going around the gallery with a wealthy sheikh: people who want to sell fake bank CDs and take the sheikh's money will approach them for an introduction. Since there are very few con artists who sell fraudulent art, it does not take long to attract someone unscrupulously interested in the seemingly wealthy oilman walking alongside Irving. In actuality, the sheikh a friend of Irving's from Queens, and not a real Arab.Irving shows Richie a painting and explains that it is a fake and that people believe what they want to believe. The colleague from before interrupts, asking Irving to introduce him to the sheikh (so he can take advantage of him). Irving refuses in the same way Sydney does when she wants to hook someone; this time, it's Sydney that steps up and acts as a middleman between the con artist and their group.In his office, Irving secretly records one of his friends, Carl, asking if he can sell fake certificates and deposits to Irving's investor, the sheikh. Sydney and Richie arrive, and Carl is told his appointment is up, all while Irving is pretending he's not interested in working with Carl. But when Richie helps sell the story of the sheikh by pointing out that he is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Carl says he has an investment bigger than bank CDs. The sheikh can invest in the rebuilding of Atlantic City, a task taken on by Carmine Polito.At the FBI, Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) tells him they shouldn't try to entrap Carmine Polito, who is also a family guy well-loved by everyone in his community. Carmine had just gotten gambling legalized in Atlantic City and wants to rebuild the city, but is having trouble raising the money. Stoddard says they shouldn't go after a politician; Richie tells him to put $2 million into a Chase bank account under the sheikh's name so Carmine can verify that the sheikh is real. Stoddard refuses to wire taxpayers' money into an account, even if it's controlled by them, and begins telling Richie a story about ice fishing with his family. He says his brother wanted to go ice fishing in October and their dad said no because the ice was too thin. Richie says he knows where the story's going: the brother was too eager and fell through the ice, just like he himself is too eager. Stoddard said, no, that's not the point of the story, and tells Richie they'll continue it another time.Even though Stoddard has shut the operation down, Sydney/Edith schemes on Richie's behalf. She becomes friends with the woman in charge of all the wires, Brenda, a lonely cat woman (Colleen Camp) who is appreciative of Sydney's friendship. They get her to wire two million dollars into an FBI-controlled account. Edith then makes sure that Stoddard's boss, Anthony Amando (Alessandro Nivola) is impressed with the plan so that when he calls Stoddard to praise him, Stoddard won't be able to back out of it.Irving is now irritated that Sydney and Richie have made this about entrapping politicians since he thought they would fulfill their duty with very small criminals. Sydney supports Richie, who is adamant that he wants to think big and use video surveillance to capture big guys (and get the glory for it). Irving tells him he's going to have to rent out a luxury suite to trick Carmine Polito into believing the sheikh is real, even though Richie thinks it's unnecessary. Irving then gets mad when he finds out Sydney used her skills to get the Bureau to wire two millions to fool the sheikh and leaves Sydney alone with Richie. He straddles her on the table and they kiss, but then retracts, holding just her foot instead. He exits, leaving her flustered.A surveillance video is played of Richie showing the briefcase filled with cash that will be used to entrap the mayor. We are now back at the opening scene, where Carmine gets suspicious and leaves the hotel room. Like before, Irving runs after him. He finds Carmine outside of the Plaza on the street, bent on escaping the situation. But Irving convinces him that the opportunity they presented is real and badmouths Richie as being inferior to them. The two end up bonding as they discover they have a few things in common. Carmine says he was nervous because he was expecting to meet with the sheikh, but admits that he likes Irving and therefore will continue business with him instead of Richie.Irving tells Richie that Carmine agreed to go out to dinner with Irving and his wife but doesn't want to deal with Richie anymore. Richie is adamant to be included because he wants to use Carmine to find crooked politicians whom Carmine bribe to pay off people for licenses and casinos. Irving points out that Richie is taking them to a dangerous place; Sydney is more upset that Rosalyn gets to go to dinner with Irving instead of her.At home, it's revealed that Richie lives in a decrepit apartment with his overbearing and controlling mother. During dinner with his mother and a fiancee he doesn't love, he gets a call from Sydney/Edith who is upset about being left alone while Irving is out with Rosalyn. Richie agrees to meet Sydney, but before he heads out, he tells his mom how he's going to finally prove himself and no longer be a laughing stock.At dinner, Irving introduces Rosalyn to Carmine's wife, Dolly (Elisabeth Rohm). The four of them have a great dinner. The New York City-accented Rosalyn is obviously uncultured, but instead of weakening Carmine's perception of Irving, she actually ends up charming the table. She goes into a long story about her nail finish that has a topcoat that smells both perfume and rotten, sweet and sour, like flowers with garbage. She eventually gets drunk and falls out of her chair.At the same time, Sydney and Richie are out on the streets of New York. Richie opens up to her that he wants to do something with his life. They end up at a dance club and bond over disco dancing; the moves get steamier and steamier until they are both sexually aroused. They cut in front of a long line of women in the restroom and fool around in a stall, but Sydney/Edith decides to wait until the two of them get real with each other before they fuck. She gives him a long kiss before he leaves the stall, but she stays behind to pee, letting out a thrilled scream on the toilet.At dinner, Irving and Carmine are really bonding, singing along to a karaoke song. Next moment, Carmine is introducing Irving to a colleague, telling him that Irving is going to get New Jersey back on its feet by helping rebuild Atlantic City and creating thousands of jobs. Irving begins feeling guilty now that he's getting close to Carmine.The next day, Carmine and Irving are eating breakfast. Carmine talks about how much he loves his community and he really wants the sheikh to realize how helpful his investment is going to be to the people in town. They walk to Carmine's car and he opens the trunk to reveal a thank you gift to Irving, something that is too new technologically for Irving to recognize. Carmine explains that it's a microwave and it heats up food in a scientific way. Once again, Irving feels guilty but Carmine doesn't catch on; he just tells Irving not to put metal in his gift.At the FBI, Richie (now in sunglasses and a bomber jacket) is demanding that the sheikh arrive in a jet; Stoddard says he should just arrive on the curb at JFK. Richie aggressively points out they should be committed to selling the sheikh as wealthy and finally is successful in convincing Stoddard. Richie walks away, but stops to request Stoddard finish the ice fishing story. Stoddard says his brother and he were on the ice and he saw his father running towards them; Stoddard stepped in front of his brother to protect him. Richie says, ""Oh, you were trying to protect your brother but you couldn't just like you are trying to protect me. The story's about protection."" Stoddard says, ""No, that's not what it's about."" Richie leaves.In Long Island, Rosalyn is mocking Irving, muttering to herself ""Don't put metal in the science oven, don't put metal in the science oven."" She puts a foil-wrapped tray inside the microwave, and it immediately explodes. Danny shouts, ""Another fire!""When Irving comes home, he is irritated that Rosalyn destroyed the microwave Carmine gave him, but she responds by making fun of him for being in love with Carmine, and says he should get a chain with a gold microwave around his neck. She also points out that she read that science ovens take the nutrients out of their food, and hands him a magazine article to prove it. As he reads, she mutters to herself, ""Bring something into this house that's going to take all the nutrition out of our food, and then light our house on fire? Thank God for me.""On the tarmac, Richie and Sydney kiss while Irving watches on. She encourages Richie to not be nervous. As he walks away, Irving approaches her, but she wants nothing to do with him, upset that she has to share him with Rosalyn. Richie and Irving board the private jet that the FBI has rented for an hour. They meet the fake sheikh, replacing Irving's friend, since this guy is with the Bureau. Irving is irritated because he's a Mexican named Paco Hernandez (Michael Peña) and doesn't speak Arabic, although Paco says he knows a few phrases. Irving tells Paco to give Carmine an ornate dagger and present it as if it's a sacred, expensive artifact. Paco points out that the name of the operation is offensive: it's revealed to be Abscam (Arab scam). Irving responds, ""What do you care? You're Mexican.""The fake sheikh greets Carmine outside the jet and presents him with the sacred knife.At home, Rosalyn is bitching to Irving that she cannot go to a meeting with him, even though she's already done her hair. She answers a ringing phone, and Richie is on the other end. Rosalyn listens in from a phone in the kitchen and overhears Richie talking about feds. After he hangs up, Rosalyn asks Irving if the conversation has to do with IRS, a tax thing. The phone rings again and this time, it's Carmine. Rosalyn tells him that Irving isn't letting her come to the event that night; when Irving takes the phone, Carmine tells him that his wife is the life of the party and to bring her. Irving is nervous, telling Carmine that his wife is unpredictable (he's secretly worried that she will blow their cover somehow). Carmine won't take no for an answer; Donna has even bought the nail finish Rosalyn had told her she couldn't find. Now Irving has no choice but to bring Rosalyn along.Out front, Irving and Carmine bond with Rosalyn and Dolly; their bonding is interrupted by the arrival of Sydney and Richie and the (Mexican) sheikh. Rosalyn stares at Sydney and mutters,"" I know who you are."" She repeats to Irving that she knows who Sydney is.Everybody enters the lobby of the hotel-casino. Carmine obviously has a genuine interest in creating a great Atlantic City, more so than making money. He tells Irving that he saved them $50 million by choosing to renovate instead of building from the ground up. They go into the gambling room where Rosalyn glares at Sydney some more. Carmine pulls Irving aside and tells him that he is saving a lot of money by working with casino guys standing at the bar who happen to be the mob. Irving tries to circumvent a meeting with them, but Rosalyn, hearing everyone is nervous to approach, decides to cross to the mob guys and say hello. She catches the eye of Pete Musane (Jack Huston) whom she flirts with. Irving and Carmine now approach to reel in Rosalyn; Richie steps forward as well, introducing the sheikh. The guys at the bar tell them that Victor Tellegio (a mob boss) is in the back room and wants to meet them. Irving tries to avoid the situation but the mob guys insist.Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the sheikh now meet Victor Tellegio (Robert De Niro in a surprise cameo), a mob boss who never buried a body because he felt it left a better message to just leave it in the street. Employees set up a table and they all take a seat. Victor says its been a dream to build casino resorts on the East Coast. He says even though Carmine made this legal, he has 40 years of history and has to be careful. To get a gaming license and keep it, they will have to make their principal investor, the sheikh, an American citizen. Carmine is asked to use congressmen and senators he knows to expedite citizenship, although Irving tries to talk him out of doing something unscrupulous (because they've become close). Victor is suspicious of Irving's concern, and he points out that they are a real organization and he hopes that everything else is real. He begins speaking Arabic to the sheikh to see if he actually knows the language. It turns out he's got casino investments in the Middle East, and he spent two years learning Arabic to keep an upper hand. Irving and Richie get very scared. Richie tries to intervene, but Mr. Tellegio insists the sheikh speak for himself. Someone enters the room, interrupting. Paco then says, in Arabic, ""It'll be great doing business with you. The investment is real. It was a pleasure to meet you."" Even though his memorized phrases are not in response to what Victor said, it's enough to assuage his suspicion.Mr. Tellegio says they should put $10 million in the bank of his choice in the next two weeks or else they will insult his friends in Florida. Outside, Sydney asks Rosalyn to come with he,r but Rosalyn refuses, calling her her husband's whore. Sydney and Dolly continue glaring at Rosalyn across the room while Rosalyn and Pete end up bonding over their love of the phrase ""What's meant to be will be.""Moments later, Rosalyn goes to the bathroom. Sydney follows behind, yelling at her for flirting with the mobsters. Rosalyn is unmoved, pointing out that she has a ring on her finger. Sydney replies that what Irving and she had might be over now, but it was beautiful and it was real and they loved each other. This makes Rosalyn cry. Sydney continues, pointing out that Rosalyn scares and manipulates Irving by the use of her son. Rosalyn replies by saying he keeps coming back, so there must be something he loves, just like perfume that you can't stop smelling even though there's something sour in it. She tells Sydney's he's never going to leave her, and she's going to make Sydney sorry for what she's done to her family. They call each other gross, and Rosalyn applauds Irving for being consistent and says, ""Sometimes all you have in life are fucked up, poisonous choices."" She then kisses Sydney hard on the mouth and walks away, laughing. A dazed Sydney wipes a big lipstick smear from her mouth.In the lobby, Rosalyn finds Pete and begins sobbing in his arms. Sydney walks away, turning around to see a very upset Rosalyn with Pete. She steps into the back room and whispers something to Irving. The group leaves Mr. Tellegio behind. He watches them go.On stage, in a ballroom, Carmine is introduced to the crowd. Irving is flustered from all the excitement of meeting Victor Tellegio, and takes a pill for his heart to calm himself down. Rosalyn walks by him with Pete. Sydney stands nearby with Richie, both listening to Carmine's enthusiastic speech to a cheering crowd of locals. Carmine further reveals that he really loves his community, and that has been his motivation for wanting to restore Atlantic City.Irving goes to one of his dry cleaners and opens a safe in the back. He takes out a lot of cash, as well as a handgun. He then stands inside the dry cleaner conveyor, the location where he first kissed Sydney.Meanwhile, Richie knocks on Sydney's door at her apartment. He still thinks she's Edith, a British woman. Richie tells her last night was insane and calls Stoddard to request the Sherman suite at the Plaza Hotel (an entire floor); Stoddard refuses. Richie explains that Carmine has admitted to taking bribes from members of Congress and reveals that Victor Tellegio is demanding ten million dollars in two weeks. He becomes ecstatic as Stoddard refuses to cooperate and hangs up the phone. He begins kissing Sydney, and asks her to calm him down; he then demands they finally have sex. As they begin getting intimate, she reminds him they're not going to go all the way until they get real. He tells her he loves her, and points out that everything has just gotten real. Moved by his feelings for her, they kiss some more, and she interrupts to tell him the truth that she's an American, not a British woman as she's been pretending. He is confused. She tells him she's falsified her records, and her name is Sydney Prosser from Albuquerque, New Mexico. He asks why she was doing an English accent after they agreed to be real in the stall; she says she needed the Edith persona to survive, the way he lives with his mom and fiancee he doesn't acknowledge, and curls his hair even though he has straight hair. She points out we all do things to survive. He says he's confused, and that maybe fucking will help. They begin to kiss again, but she's not into it; to get him away from her, she smashes a small framed picture over his head.Just then, Irving enters. He points his handgun at Richie and asks him to step away from Edith. He reveals he knows she is Sydney and that she is not British; she admits that she told him and doesn't care. Irving tells Richie what they've gotten into is worse than jail, and since they can't get ten million wired to Tellegio, the jig is up. Richie points out that when Tellegio finds out he's been had, he's not going to go after Richie (an FBI agent) or Carmine (a politician), he's going to go after Irving and his son, as well as Sydney. Richie calls Stoddard again and demands the suite of the Plaza Hotel and to be told the point of the fishing story; Stoddard replies, ""Not the way you're behaving."" Still frustrated, Richie asks Stoddard where he is and upon being told a location, says he's going to go there right now, to beat his ass.Irving and Sydney are left behind, terrified since they are now in danger. Sydney points out she was Irving's lifeline out, and he blew the chance to run away before. She tells him they have to get over on all these guys, and he agrees that, whatever they do, it will have to be the best con they've ever done.At the FBI headquarters, Anthony Amado is listening to a deposition from Stoddard about Richie threatening to kill him. It's then revealed that Richie has, in fact, beat up Stoddard with a telephone receiver, who has all kinds of bruises on his face and a bandage over his left eye. Richie uses the meeting to request the Sherman Suite in the Plaza Hotel; he points out that the mafia and crooked politicians have intersected, and that they can snag all of them with Anthony's approval. Anthony says he won't wire ten million dollars, but he will pay for the Sherman suite so they can record congressmen taking bribes. He tells Richie he's proud of him.Outside, Stoddard yells at Richie. Richie only asks how the fishing story ends, and when Stoddard refuses to tell him, Richie says he'll call Stoddard's brother. Stoddard replies, ""My brother's dead!"" Richie then thinks he's figured out the story: Stoddard's brother fell through the ice. Stoddard replies, ""No, he died a different way many years later."" (The ending to ice fishing story is never revealed)Richie makes amends with both Sydney and Irving in the Plaza Hotel. They set up a room in the Sherman suite with hidden cameras.Carmine calls several congressmen, and tries to convince them to make investment opportunities. Richie videotapes himself putting bribes into suitcases. They meet various congressmen and a senator, pitching the idea to each one. One agrees to expedite the sheikh's citizenship. Several others feel secure in investing because they know Carmine is a good man. One by one, they take all the bribes. Irving feels guilty, knowing Carmine only has good intentions. He steps outside and talks to Sydney who says the only way to help Carmine is through their plan for Tellegio, a plan that makes Irving nervous. Sydney assures him there's only one thing that can mess things up and that's his wife.Cut to Rosalyn dropping Danny off at school and then being picked up by the mob guy, Pete; she has her sweet and sour nail finish in hand. Pete and Rosalyn go to a fancy restaurant where Pete tries to convince her to go to Florida with him, leaving Irving behind. Rosalyn responds by venting about her husband, explaining that she hears him on the phone and that he loves Carmine but hates the curly-headed IRS guy. She expands, explaining that he's in some kind of bind, throwing money to Congress or something. Pete gives Rosalyn a huge wad of cash and says he has to leave to talk to his boss (Tellegio) back home. She tells Pete not to hurt Irving too hard.At home, Rosalyn goes home and sings along to Paul McCartney's ""Live and Let Die"" while she cleans her house. This is juxtaposed with Irving and Carmine ambushed by Pete and taken for a ride.Rosalyn tells Danny the truth about his father, and tells him not to repeat it. Outside, a car squeals up onto her driveway. Irving enters the house, yelling at Rosalyn, telling her that he knows she was in Pete's car because she had left her sweet and sour nail polish on the dashboard. This tipped him off to know he was in danger. During the drive, the mob guy in the backseat put a canvas bag over Irving's head and then pointed a gun at his neck. Rosalyn defends herself, telling him not to scream at her. But Irving is frantic since he knows how much danger she put him in. She replies, crying, saying she is left alone all day and she just wants him to love her but since he can't, she's going away with Pete. Irving is concerned about how much danger she'd be in if she moved to Florida with a mob guy. She says she only meets people through him, so whom else did he expect her to date instead of him? Irving struggles for a heart pill, and she asks him what kind of trouble he's in. He tells her he has a plan, and it came to him when he was in the canvas bag.We return to a few minutes earlier. Irving tells Pete that he has two million out of the ten that will be wired that week. At home, Rosalyn takes credit for Irving getting himself out of a bad situation, saying she knows how hard he is to motivate, and that she knew if she got Pete to knock some sense into his head, he would figure things out. She tells him about a book she's reading called The Power of Intention, and the reason she sent Pete to him was so Irving could come up with the plan. She tells him, ""You're welcome,"" and in disbelief, he thanks her. Rosalyn tells him maybe she's a better partner than Edith (Sydney), and maybe he underestimated her. She tells him she'll tell Pete she was wrong about the IRS, but points out she was actually right and repeats her the power of intention motto. She then tells him he needs to grow up and face the facts that they should get a divorce.In voice-over, Irving explains that necessity is the mother of invention, and the FBI is willing to wire two million dollars if it means taking down Tellegio and his entire organization. Tellegio won't meet at a public place like the Plaza but only at the office of his attorney.So Irving, Sydney, and Richie visit a skyscraper in New York with high security. They are finally allowed inside, but Tellegio is not there-- only his lawyer, Alfonse Simone, and a secretary. Alfonse admits the trip was unnecessary because everything could have been done with a wire transfer. He gives the number of Tellegio's account on a piece of paper, and tells them Victor is out of town. Richie is upset and says they were willing to come in person to give two million dollars out of respect. Alfonse points out he still has the power of attorney, but Irving suggests they just leave; Sydney and he debate back and forth whether they should stay or not. Irving and Richie start to leave but Sydney stays behind and suggests they call the sheikh. Richie catches on and says they'll call the sheikh if Alfonse explains specifically what the money will be used for. Alfonse responds by revealing, ""We will guarantee all proper licenses and construction permits for any hotel-casino that plans to open before the end of the year. And we'll throw in the customary privileges and protections."" Richie asks, ""What if there's obstacles? What will you do?"" Alfonse responds, ""If we have to pay somebody off, we'll pay somebody off. If we have to lean on somebody, intimidate somebody, we'll intimidate somebody."" He also adds, ""At the end of this, we'll teach you how to skim and make some money on the side because we invented skimming and have been doing it for 30 years.""This is all captured on a video in Sydney's purse and on a wire in Richie's tie. Richie calls Anthony at the wiring desk with Brenda, the cat lady. Now that they have evidence against Tellegio, Anthony (talking on the phone as if he works for the sheikh) agrees to wire the money to catch Victor accepting a bribe. The money is transferred.Irving, Sydney, and Richie leave. Richie is ecstatic at getting evidence that Tellegio is corrupt. He goes back to the office, screaming about finally getting some respect as everyone in his office cheers. The recording of Alfonse admitting that they intimidate people to get what they want is played and everyone cheers again. In a great mood, Richie begins humping Stoddard's leg, laughing at him as Stoddard leaves the room, moping.Irving and Sydney drive to Carmine's house. While Sydney waits in the car, Irving gets out and reveals to Carmine that the sheikh was a fake and that he was working with the Feds. Carmine gets upset, pointing out that he's been a politician for 20 years and that he didn't want to take the money, but Irving chased after him to convince him to do business, even though his judgment told him to leave. Carmine adds that everything he did was for the good of the people of New Jersey, and he had no selfish motives. Irving knows this is true, and says he has some leverage to make it right. Carmine is just upset, pointing out the ceremonial knife he has on display in his living room and how much he's been fooled. Carmine kicks Irving out of his house as all of Carmine's sons and daughters watch from his staircase, in tears.Irving collapses on his way back to the car, stressed and fumbling for heart pills. Sydney helps him back to the car. They rest on the seats; she kisses his hand and it's obvious they are in love again.Cut to Richie, Stoddard, and Anthony with accusatory stares at the FBI headquarters. Sydney and Irving stand opposite them. Anthony reveals the two million dollars that was wired is missing. An anonymous phone call has told them that in exchange for immunity for Sydney and Irving, and a reduced sentence for Carmine Polito, they will get their two million dollars back. Irving and Sydney refuse any involvement. Richie points out that they can be charged for wire fraud but Irving points out that it was Richie that requested the two million (Irving had tried to convince them to leave), and Richie had given the wiring instructions. Irving also points out that if the public found out about Richie's gross incompetence, the FBI would be a laughing stock.It turns out that when Richie went back to bust Alfonse Simone, there was a divorce attorney there instead. The man Rich thought was Alfonso Simone was actually Ed Malone, the mutual con artist friend who threw the party that Irving first met Sydney at. Richie defends himself by saying he was conned; Irving points out that it makes him look just as incompetent, since he was conned by the very same con men whom he forced to entrap the members of Congress in the first place. He also points out that Richie was only able to find evidence against good guys like Carmine who were really just working to better New Jersey; and that he didn't get anything on the big guys like Tellegio. Stoddard tells Richie he should go home, and that he won't be involved with the case anymore, except for witness testimony.Six congressmen, one senator, and Carmine Polito are all arrested. Because the two million is given back by Irving and Sydney, Carmine's sentence is reduced to 18 months. When the story was written, all accounts of Richie's involvement are left out; he never gets the glory he craved for so long. Sydney and Irving move in together; Rosalyn goes on to live with Pete, who tells Irving that Victor Tellegio appreciates him for making sure he was free of any conviction (since he never took any money, since the two million dollars was wired to Irving and Sydney instead). Before they go, Rosalyn gives Irving the sweet and sour nail finish she says he loves.Sydney becomes a surrogate mother to Danny for whenever Rosalyn's out of town with Pete. She and Irving get a loan from a bank and begin to sell legitimate paintings. The last shot is Sydney back at her apartment, putting Duke Ellington on the record player and staring seductively at Irving."
The Great Gatsby,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343092/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A writer and wall street trader, Nick, finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor, Jay Gatsby. An adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's Long Island-set novel, where Midwesterner Nick Carraway is lured into the lavish world of his neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Soon enough, however, Carraway sees through the cracks of Gatsby's nouveau riche existence, where obsession, madness, and tragedy await.—Anonymous In 1929 New York, bond-seller Nick Carraway, in a sanitarium for depression and alcoholism, is persuaded by his doctor to write a therapeutic account of what put him there. Nick's journal describes how, seven years earlier, he had moved to a tiny house on Long Island adjoining the sumptuous mansion owned by enigmatic neighbour, the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby. After attending one of Gatsby's legendary parties Nick is asked by Gatsby to arrange a meeting with his cousin Daisy, now married to the brutish. philandering Tom Buchanan, who was Gatsby's true love prior to war service. As Nick complies he comes to see that Gatsby, once a poor boy, has recreated himself as a fascinating millionaire purely to win Daisy back but the events of a drunken afternoon conspire to bring about an ending which is anything but happy.—don @ minifie-1 Midwest native Nick Carraway arrives in 1922 New York in search of the American dream. Nick, a would-be writer, moves in next door to millionaire Jay Gatsby and across the bay from his cousin Daisy and her philandering husband Tom (Joel Edgerton). Thus, Nick becomes drawn into the captivating world of the wealthy and -- as he bears witness to their illusions and deceits -- pens a tale of impossible love, dreams, and tragedy.—Jwelch5742 It's the spring of 1922, and wide-eyed Midwesterner Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) has just moved to New York City in pursuit of the American Dream. Settling into a home next door to wealthy Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), Carraway grows increasingly fascinated by the elaborate parties held at his new neighbor's estate. Meanwhile, across the bay, Carraway's cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) flounders in her marriage to philandering aristocrat Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Inspired by the debauchery on display at Gatsby's wild parties and the lives of the wealthy elite, Carraway begins putting pen to paper as it gradually becomes clear that his cousin and the millionaire share a complicated romantic past that remains unresolved. The film starts with a shot of the flashing green light in East Egg, Long Island, as Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) says how his father told him to always see the good in others. He is seen in the Perkins Sanitarium talking to a doctor, whose records indicate that Nick is there due to his alcoholism, among other things. Nick adds that there was only one person who he saw good in: Gatsby.Nick takes us back to the previous spring in 1922, where Wall Street was booming, and bootleggers were in business due to the alcohol ban. Nick moves to a cottage on Long Island in West Egg, saying he was full of ambition as he started working as a bond broker for Wall Street after originally wanting to be a writer. This cottage was next door to Gatsby's mansion.Nick goes across the bay to visit his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her blue blooded husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton), who went to Yale with Nick. Daisy introduces Nick to Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki), a golfer. Over dinner, we learn that Tom is pretty arrogant and racist, remarking on the rise of the colored empire. He gets a phone call, and Jordan tells Nick that Tom is having an affair. Later, Nick walks with Daisy, who says she has become cynical lately. Nick asks about her daughter, and Daisy mentions she is glad she had a girl and hopes she can be a fool, because, in her words, that's the best thing a girl in this world can be. Nick returns home and notices a figure standing on the pier and looking and reaching toward the green light, and Nick believes this is Gatsby.The doctor at the sanitarium convinces Nick to write a novel about his experience. He continues the story by writing about the Valley of Ashes, a desolate part of New York featuring a billboard with two eyes watching over everybody, said to be the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg. Nick and Tom are headed to the Yale Club when they get off the commuter train and head to a car repair garage run by George Wilson (Jason Clarke). Tom chats with him over business matters, and George's wife Myrtle (Isla Fisher) comes downstairs. It becomes obvious that she is Tom's mistress. She mentions her sister is coming to New York and wants to introduce her to Nick.Later, at an apartment, while Tom and Myrtle are going at it in the bedroom, her sister Catherine (Adelaide Clemens) comes in with two other friends. They begin to have a party, and Nick remarks that this is only the second time he's ever been drunk. At night, he watches from the window and looks upon the people in the town, saying he finds himself within and without the world he is in. Myrtle comes out of the bedroom shouting Daisy's name, enraging Tom and causing him to smack her hard across the face.Nick wakes up in his home and says he has no memory of how he got back. He opens front door to find that he has received an invitation to a party at Gatsby's, saying he was the only one who has ever gotten a direct invitation, as all the other wealthy people in New York just come to his mansion and indulge themselves. He goes to the party, which is extravagant, and asks around for Gatsby, but nobody has seen him. He runs into Jordan, who is also curious to find him. They hear rumors such as Gatsby being a German spy or an assassin. Eventually, Nick happens to encounter the man himself, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Nick tells Jordan that he imagined Gatsby to be older and fatter. A man comes by and tells Jordan that Gatsby wishes to speak with her in private. A while later, as the party comes to an end, she comes out telling Nick that she just heard something very shocking. Before she can say anything else, she is pulled away by a snobby rich man.The next morning, Gatsby shows up at Nick's cottage in his Duesenberg and takes Nick on a trip, describing to him ""God's truth"" about himself. He claims to have come from a wealthy family that are now all dead, and later attending Oxford and going on to become a decorated WWI veteran. He takes Nick into the city to meet with his business partner Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan). They go into a bar beneath a barbershop where bootlegged alcohol is being sold. We learn that Wolfsheim is rumored to have rigged the 1919 World Series, and Gatsby considers setting Nick up for a business with them. Tom Buchanan shows up, at which point Gatsby vanishes.Nick has lunch with Jordan, who tells him what her conversation with Gatsby was about. Through a flashback, we learn from Jordan that five years earlier, Gatsby and Daisy were romantically involved while living in Louisville, Kentucky when Gatsby was a war officer. When he is called away, she waited for him, but then eventually met Tom and was set to marry him. Before their wedding, however, she got a letter from Gatsby, causing Daisy to nearly get cold feet, but she went on to marry Tom. Gatsby also intentionally bought his mansion across from Daisy's home, hoping to see her. Jordan tells Nick that he wants him to invite Daisy over for tea. He approaches Gatsby that night and says he will do it.The following morning, a bunch of people fix up Nick's lawn and home, and it's clear that Gatsby intended to have tea at Nick's place instead of his. They fix it up and make it look nice, but Gatsby starts getting nervous. He almost leaves until Daisy comes in. Nick brings her inside, but Gatsby has fled. She is amazed at all the flowers in the living room, and then Nick hears a knock at the door. It is Gatsby, dripping wet from the pouring rain outside. He enters, and Daisy sees him, and they both comment on how glad they are to see each other again. The tea time is awkward, until Nick decides to leave them alone by saying he is going into the city. When he gets back to his house, Gatsby decides to take them to his place, and they spend some time at the beach before coming back to his home. He shows Daisy a variety of shirts he possesses, and while she is excited, she starts crying. Nick knows it's sudden for her after five years, but she won't admit that.Nick tells some truth about Gatsby. His real name is James Gatz, and that he came from a poor family of farmers from North Dakota. He did not see himself as part of that family and as he got older, he set off to accomplish more. While riding his boat, he encountered a yacht sailed by a man named Dan Cody (Steve Bisley). The young James Gatz rescued him from a storm and went on to sail with him, adopting some of Cody's customs like using the term ""old sport"" (which he frequently calls Nick). After Cody died, he did not receive his inheritance because of Cody's family, so Gatsby went on to make himself a wealthy man.Gatsby throws another party, this time having Daisy and Tom show up. She and Gatsby retreat to a nearby location where they begin to kiss passionately. Daisy says she wishes they could run away together. Gatsby is pulled away by his butler to settle a business dispute. After the party is over, Gatsby believes Daisy did not have a good time. He tells Nick that he needs her to tell Tom she doesn't love him so they can go back to Louisville and get married. Nick tells him he can't repeat the past, but Gatsby insists he can. He notes the first time he kissed Daisy when they first met, and Gatsby felt he had already married her. Before leaving, he tells Nick he is wrong about the past.Gatsby stops throwing parties for a while. One day, which happens to be the hottest day of the summer, he invites Nick, Daisy, Tom, and Jordan over for lunch. Gatsby tries to hold Daisy's hand, but she panics and claims she is bored and wants to go into the city. Tom notices that she is feeling something for Gatsby, so he agrees to go into the city. Gatsby and Daisy drive off in his car while Tom takes Nick and Jordan. They stop for gas at George Wilson's garage, and he has learned of Myrtle's infidelity, but not that she's sleeping with Tom.The group meets up at a hotel where a man is cutting up a large block of ice to pass around because of the heat and for drinks. Tom starts to slowly antagonize Gatsby, hoping for a confrontation. He mocks his use of ""old sport"", claiming he lied about Oxford, and accuses him of bootlegging with Wolfsheim. Gatsby hits back by saying Daisy loves him and not Tom, putting her in an uncomfortable position. As Tom continues to egg him on, Gatsby snaps, throws the alcohol and grabs Tom, screaming at him and nearly hitting him. This frightens Daisy and Jordan. She and Gatsby leave. Tom decides to open a bottle of liquor and offers Nick some. He remarks that he just remembered that day was his birthday.At night, Myrtle is being abused by George as he asks her where she got her pearls. She runs out into the street as she sees the Duesenberg coming, thinking it's Tom. The car speeds as Gatsby grabs the wheel, trying to swerve, but the car strikes Myrtle and kills her instantly. Tom, Nick, and Jordan drive by the scene and discover Myrtle's corpse as the police are on the scene. Tom is visibly distraught but denies having known her well. He goes to George, who is grieving. Tom tells him that the car that hit Myrtle was driven by Gatsby.The Buchanans go back to their place. Jordan invites Nick inside, but he refuses. As he leaves, he hears Gatsby calling to him. He tells Nick that Daisy was driving after leaving the city to ease her tension, but although he tried to move the car, they were unable to stop from hitting Myrtle. Nick walks away, seeing Tom and Daisy talking, apparently having reconciled.Nick meets up with Gatsby later as he is fixing up the Duesenberg and covering it. He learns more about Gatsby - the whole truth. Gatsby was always after Daisy and hoped she would wait for him after he came back from the war. Although he was penniless, he wanted to come back to her, but she had already married Tom. Nick realizes Gatsby truly loved Daisy, and he only threw the parties in the hopes that she would show up for one of them. That morning, Gatsby's gardener comes in and says he is to drain the pool before the leaves fall. Gatsby decides to take a swim before that and asks Nick to join him but he declines. Before finally leaving, Nick tells Gatsby that the Buchanans are rotten people and that Gatsby is worth more than them. They share a friendly wave before departing.At work, Nick is too distracted and hopes Gatsby will call him with good news. At the same time, we see Daisy looking at her phone as she considers calling Gatsby. The phone rings at his place, and Gatsby hears it, excited. However, he does not see George Wilson behind him, who shoots him in the back. He falls into his pool, dead, just as George turns the gun on himself. We also see that it was Nick, not Daisy, who was calling, and he panics as he heard the gunshots.After Gatsby's death, the media blamed him for the affair with Myrtle, as well as her death. Nick is upset that he could not tell them the truth. His place is bombarded with reporters who ungraciously huddle over his open casket. Nick tries to get in touch with Daisy, but she and Tom are leaving with their daughter, packing up everything and having their butler tell Nick they are gone. Nick adds that virtually nobody attended Gatsby's funeral except him. He would later go on to leave New York and go back to the Midwest, completely disillusioned. He also muses that Gatsby could not see that his dream of being with Daisy was behind him.Nick completes his novel, simply titling it ""Gatsby"". He takes another look at the cover page and writes something extra, now calling it ""The Great Gatsby""."

However, this cannot be done without further evidence and authorization from the Catholic Church.During the process of researching the house's history, Ed and Lorraine find out that the house belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba. When Bathsheba's husband caught her sacrificing their week-old infant, she climbed to the top of a tree on the property, cursed all those who would take her land, and proclaimed her love for Satan before committing suicide. This is followed by reports found of numerous murders and suicides in houses that have since been built upon the property.Ed and Lorraine return to the house with a police officer, and another paranormal investigator, Drew. They set up thermal cameras, and alarm systems throughout the house in an attempt to prove the spirit of Bathsheba is inhabiting the house and receive authorization from the Catholic Church. For the first night, nothing happens, and the clocks do not stop at 3:07AM. The next day, they all eat breakfast together and Roger Perron thanks Ed Warren for doing what they can to help. Ed explains that with every exorcism they do, a little piece of his wife Lorraine is taken, but he promises they will do what they can to help them.During another night of investigation, nothing seems to happen until nightfall, when Cindy begins to sleepwalk again. While walking upstairs, thermal cameras observe a temperature drop around her as she enters into the wardrobe, whereupon the door slams shut behind her. The others force their way into the room and find a secret passage behind the wardrobe. After Cindy is taken out, Lorraine enters the wardrobe and falls through the floor boards down into the cellar. There, she sees the spirits of people whom Bathsheba has possessed, and realizes Bathsheba's purpose: to possess mothers and use them to kill their children.After Lorraine escapes the cellar, she and Ed take their evidence to Father Gordan to organize an exorcism while the Perron family takes refuge at a hotel. Their relief is interrupted when Carolyn suddenly drives back to the house with two of the daughters. Ed and Lorraine rush to the house, where they find Roger and the police officer struggling with Carolyn as she tries to stab one of her daughters with a pair of scissors. Ed suggests they call the priest, but Lorraine reminds him that the priest is too far away, forcing Ed to perform the exorcism himself. While the others hold the tormented Carolyn down, Ed continues the exorcism.Carolyn seemingly stops struggling, and for a brief moment it seems the excorism was successful. Suddenly, her chairs flips over end and she is held upside down. Ed yells for the demon to put her down, and after a few tense moments, she is released onto the ground. Ed rushes over to Carolyn, and tells the demon to leave her body. Carolyn slowly turns to Ed and says, ""She's already gone."".Meanwhile, Drew finds April hiding under the floorboards in the kitchen. He yells down the cellar that he found her, and this alerts the Demon inside Carolyn and she dashes up cellar stairs to find April, in order to complete the sacrifice. Ed and Lorraine Warren, along with Roger, rush up the stairs after her in order to stop her from going through with it. The possessed Carolyn chases after April thru a tunnel underneath the floorboards. Carolyn grabs a hold of April, but at the same time, Lorraine reaches down through the floor and grabs Carolyns head. She tells Carolyn to remember how much her family means to her, and to remember what she told her about how special they were to her and that they mean the world to her, and what she would leave behind if she went through with it. This seems to get through to Carolyn, as her face relaxes, and her breathing returns to normal. The demonic presence in her eyes seems to fade, and she puts April down.The scene changes to Carolyn being helped out of the front door, to a now sunny morning. As she crosses from threshold of the door into the sunlight, the bruises on her skin fade away and she returns to her normal self. Roger and Carolyn rejoice with their family in the front yard, embracing one another, knowing that it's finally over.After they ward off the demon at the Perron household, the Warrens return to their home. The scene cuts to Ed Warren entering his room of possessed objects and artifacts. He places the old music box from the house on an empty space on a shelf. Lorraine enters the room, and they leave together. After a few seconds, the music box starts to play on its own, and the camera slowly pans back to the music box. The camera zooms in on the mirror of the open music box, and the music slowly comes to a stop. The screen cuts to black, and the credits roll."
Identity Thief,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024432/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Mild mannered businessman Sandy Patterson travels from Denver to Florida to confront the deceptively harmless looking woman who has been living it up after stealing Sandy's identity. Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) gets a nice call confirming his name and other identifying information. The next thing he knows, a spa in Florida is reminding him of his appointment and his credit cards are maxed out. With his identity stolen, Sandy leaves his wife, kids and job to literally bring the thief to justice in Colorado. Keeping tabs on the other Sandy (Melissa McCarthy) and run-ins with bounty hunters is harder than he was expecting, and ultimately the cross-country trip is going to find both Sandys learning life tips from one another.—napierslogs Sandy Patterson learns that someone stole his identity and ran up a huge credit card debt. Sandy's job is in jeopardy because of it. The police are unable to do anything. So Sandy decides to find the person who stole his identity so that the whole thing could be straightened out. He finds the person, a woman who tries to run for it but Sandy stops her. He tries to bring her back but there are some people who want her too for other reasons. So Sandy is dodging bullets and being attacked.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Sandy and Trish Patterson - an efficient, by-the-books in-house accounts processor for the Denver head office of the Prominence Financial Group and his stay-at-home pregnant wife carrying child number three respectively - are having troubles making ends meet despite all their efforts, especially as Prominence, in the greed and arrogance of Sandy's boss, Harold Cornish, has not provided employee bonuses for three years. When his professional life seems to be looking up after he gets a new job at a new company, New Concepts, which would increase his salary five-fold, Sandy discovers through a series of not-so-pleasant incidents mostly involving his declining credit rating that his identity has been stolen by a woman in Winter Park, Florida. What happened is that he received a telephone call from a fraud protection service informing him that they had indication that someone had been trying to steal his identity, they who offered a free service to prevent such occurrences. In providing the caller with his sensitive, personal information to sign up for this free service, he unwittingly provided the caller, the true fraudster, all the necessary information for her indeed to steal his identity. The Denver PD are unwilling to help Sandy with the crimes happening in Florida, and the identity theft is causing problems for Sandy's new boss and longtime associate, Daniel Casey, which ultimately threatens Sandy's tenure in this new job and with New Concepts. As such, Sandy, armed with the fraudster's photograph, hatches a plan to bring the woman to Denver to confess all to Daniel and unwittingly to the Denver PD, which would not only get Sandy his identity back but bring her on the road to justice. Sandy may have difficulty achieving his end goal in he underestimating ""Diana"", a brash, friendless woman who has been able to, among other things, ""buy"" friendship through the fraud, and he not knowing what other criminal activities she has been involved in, which may involve others even more dangerous than her.—Huggo Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Bateman) has a problem. A Denver family man who's always been responsible with his personal finances, he is shocked to learn that his credit score is in shambles. But it gets worse -- if he can't clear his name in a week, the mix-up could very well cost him his job. Fortunately Sandy is in luck; after the unrepentant Florida fraudster (McCarthy) who stole his identity causes a stir in a club and misses her court date, Sandy is arrested and promptly released when detectives request a mug shot, and realize their mistake. When the police refuse to offer any help, Sandy realizes that his only choice is to catch the impostor himself and bring her back to Denver to face justice. Unfortunately, this wily thief isn't going down without a fight, and with a grizzled skip tracer (Robert Patrick) and a pair of vicious gangsters (Génesis Rodríguez and T.I.) determined to get the fake Sandy first, every step along the way will be a struggle. Sandy Patterson gets a call from a woman saying someone attempted to steal his identity. She tells him about an identity protection service and asks him for his name, date of birth, and social security number. Little does he know that his identity is actually about to be stolen.We meet Diana, printing out credit cards with Sandy's money and going out to a bar, buying drinks for everybody.At work, Sandy gets called in by his boss, Harold Cornish, and he asks him to make cuts on bonuses, despite the fact that he is getting a bonus himself. As Sandy goes to do so, he gets a call saying he has an appointment at a salon on Friday in Florida. He's confused, but he gets called over by his co-worker Daniel Casey. In the parking lot, he and a few other co-workers meet to discuss starting their own firm since their boss is not the greatest person. Daniel asks Sandy if he'll join them, to which he agrees.A little while later, Sandy tries to get gas, but his card is declined for insufficient funds and the gas station clerk cuts it up. He calls the credit card company and he's told he's spent a lot of money in Florida. As this happens, he gets arrested. At the same time in Florida, Diana continues splurging with Sandy's money. At a police station, Detective Reilly tells Sandy that he missed a court date in Florida for assault. They pull up a mug shot of Diana and determine she's stolen Sandy's identity. It gets worse at work when Daniel (now his boss) says cops are asking about him possessing drugs. Reilly and other cops show up and say a card with Sandy's name was used to buy drugs from a man named Paolo. When told they can't do anything unless the identity thief was standing there in Denver with them, Sandy (knowing where he can find her) offers to go on his own and bring her there and get her to talk to Daniel to clear his name and that he won't press charges.Trish, Sandy's wife, finds out about the situation and knows Sandy's taking a risk, but he assures her he'll get the job done. He ends up in Florida and finds Diana at the salon where she made an appointment and follows her. After confronting her on the road she manages to steal his rental car. He obtains her address through registration in her abandoned car and goes to Diana's house, which is full of merchandise and other stolen credit cards. The pair scuffle and Sandy attempts to handcuff her. Before he can cuff her, two people named Marisol and Julian are pounding at the door, telling Diana she gave Paolo some bad credit cards. They shoot the door open, but Sandy and Diana escape.Sandy tells Diana about his plan to redeem his name and Diana agrees to go along with him. Meanwhile a bounty hunter known as Skiptracer is dispatched to track down Diana to obtain a substantial bounty. On the road, Diana reminds Sandy that the people at the airport would have an issue with both of their ID's reading ""Sandy Bigelow Patterson"", so flying back is out of the question and they must return to Denver by driving.After traveling through several states, Skiptracer catches up to the pair and captures Diana. A chase ensues and she knocks him unconscious, and Sandy rams his van off the road. When he gets out to check on Diana, a truck plows into his rental car, totaling it. They take Skiptracer's van with him tied to the back, but it overheats on the road. They end up walking and almost stop to rest in the woods, but they encounter several snakes, one of which ends up in Sandy's pants, which he takes off and throws away. Another snake bites Sandy's neck and Diana accidentally knocks him unconscious while trying to beat the snake.Sandy wakes up at a bus station in new pants with no money and no phone. He asks how they got there, and Diana says she carried him half a mile until she flagged down a truck to take them there. Unfortunately, the next bus to Denver doesn't come for another three days. Sandy finds some money in his socks and is told by a guy who works at the station about a place to find a cheap car. When they stop for gas and realize they need more money, Diana asks if there's anyone Sandy would like to get back at, and he thinks of one person Harold Cornish. Knowing that there is someone who handles his finances, the two of them sneak into an accounting firm and coax an accounts processor into giving them access into restricted files, and they steal Cornish's identity to create new credit cards. The accounts processor realizes this too late as they are fleeing.Meanwhile, Skiptracer goes to the bus station and threatens the employee unless he tells him where to find Diana. He then gets shot by Marisol who, along with Julian has been tracking the pair throughout their journey. Having overheard Skiptracer's conversation they continue to pursue Sandy and Diane.Sandy and Diana finally arrive in St. Louis and stop at a hotel and Diana spends more money than necessary. She gets a makeover and has dinner with Sandy. Things get heated when he asks Diana what her real name is, but she admits she doesn't know it. She cries as she tells him that nobody cared about her when she grew up, so she doesn't even have her own identity. She then says she lied about that just as the accounts processor comes in with cops, who arrest both Sandy and Diana. As they're being escorted, they run into Marisol and Julian. Marisol calls Paolo, who tells her to follow Diana and kill her. That's when Skiptracer arrives and shoots the two thugs in the legs and throws them in the trunk of their car.Diana manages to un-cuff herself as she's in the back of the police car, and then breaks the back windshield and escapes, just as Skiptracer hits the police car. Sandy gets out as well and Skiptracer nearly hits him, but Diana pushes him out of the way and gets rammed by the car, which causes Skiptracer to swerve off. As Sandy and Diana run away, Skiptracer is arrested along with Marisol and Julian. Diana is not injured from being hit by a car, and she and Sandy eventually make it home, where they are greeted by Trish and their daughters. Diana has dinner with Sandy's family and reconciles with them.The next morning, Sandy is prepared to tell Diana that he'll go in alone to the station, but she's gone. She left a note saying sorry. He goes into work, preparing to quit, but Daniel shows him that Diana is meeting with the police in an office. Detective Reilly tells Sandy he is no longer part of the investigation and Diana is taken away in cuffs. Before she leaves, Sandy has a moment with her and asks her why, and she says she knew he wouldn't turn her in, but it was the right thing to do for her to do it herself.One year later, Sandy is celebrating another birthday, this time with his third kid joining them. The family goes to visit Diana in prison, where she's doing well taking some exams. As Trish takes the girls outside, Sandy presents Diana with a birth certificate of hers that he was able to find and it's revealed that Diana's true name is Dawn Budgie, which she thinks is a terrible name. They laugh. Diana then hugs Sandy and starts walking. A guard taunts her, Diana reacts and hits her in the throat. Another guard on the pulls out a taser from her pocket, and tases Diana in the back. Diana falls, but recovers seconds later. She then gets up and walks back to go to her cell."

The Wolverine,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1430132/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Wolverine comes to Japan to meet an old friend whose life he saved years ago, and gets embroiled in a conspiracy involving yakuza and mutants. In modern day Japan, Wolverine is out of his depth in an unknown world as he faces his ultimate nemesis in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed. Vulnerable for the first time and pushed to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle against his own near-immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before.—Twentieth Century Fox Logan has been living a desolate life following the death of Jean Grey at his hands. A Japanese girl goes to see him, and tells him that a man he knew in World War II, and saved his life, is now dying and wants to see him. When he sees him, the man offers to make Logan mortal, but Logan refuses. Later, the man dies. At his funeral, some men try to grab the man's granddaughter. Logan saves her, but when they shoot him, Logan doesn't heal. They continue to go to a place where the girl feels safe. But men keep on finding them and the doctor who was treating the man, asks a Samurai who pledged to protect the girl, to bring her Logan. Logan still continues to deal with what happened to Jean.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Logan has become a hermit, living in the woods alone and haunted by nightmares with Jean Grey. One day, the Japanese girl Yukio, who is skilled with a samurai sword, visits Logan and tells that her grandfather, the powerful businessman Yashida, is dying and wants to see him for the last time before dying. Yashida was a Japanese soldier that Logan saved the life of in Nagasaki in the World War II. Logan travels Japan with Yukio and the moribund Yashida offers mortality to Logan, transferring his gift to him, but Logan does not accept the offer. While sleeping, Logan has a weird dream with Yashida's doctor Viper and soon Yashida dies. Logan stays for the funeral and the Yakuza tries to abduct Yashida's granddaughter Mariko during the ceremony. Logan saves and flees with Mariko, but he is shot and does not heal the wounds. Logan protects Mariko and tries to find what has happened to him.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A haunted Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) journeys to Japan to bid an old friend farewell, and gets drawn into a conflict involving ninja and Yakuza in a stand-alone spin-off set following the events of X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), and preceding the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). The story begins in Nagasaki. As a B-29 bomber appears in the sky and air-raid sirens howl, panicked Japanese troops begin committing harakiri (ritual suicide). Terrified, yet unwilling to sacrifice his own life, young soldier Yashida takes cover in a heavily fortified prison pit containing the immortal mutant Wolverine, who shields him from a deadly blast. Decades later, Wolverine has sworn off violence after he was forced to kill his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). He's confronting a hunter who has been using illegal, poison-tipped arrows when the sword-wielding Yukio (Rila Fukushima) comes to his aid, and summons him to Japan at the behest of the dying Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), now the head of Japan's largest and most powerful tech giant. Just hours before passing away, Yashida implores Wolverine to protect his granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamato), whom he has personally chosen to take over the family business, much to the chagrin of her plotting father Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada). When the Yakuza attempt a high-profile kidnapping of Mariko during Yashida's funeral, Wolverine comes to her rescue, and receives some much needed help from enigmatic ninja Harada (Will Yun Lee). Narrowly escaping with their lives, Wolverine and Mariko go into hiding with the Yakuza and ruthless mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) hot on their trail. But the battle is far from over, and with Wolverine's healing powers mysteriously diminished, he may not be able to protect Mariko for long. On 9 August 1945, in a WWII prison camp near Nagasaki, Japan, from a guard tower, a young Japanese officer Yashida (Ken Yamamura) watches a pair of B-29 bombers appear over tranquil Nagasaki. Air Raid alarms sound; Yashida sounds an alarm and hurriedly descends from his watchtower at the POW camp. While other Japanese officers prepare for death, Yashida quickly breaks open prison cells, freeing dozens of captured American soldiers. He lastly comes to a peculiar-looking cell, which looks like a tank turret securely welded over a well, chained securely to the ground: a hyper-secure prison cell. Inside is Logan (Hugh Jackman), who (while suspended by his bone claws) watches as all the inhabitants of the camp run for their lives. Yashida cuts the chains from Logan's cell and tells him to run. Each Japanese officer kneels in line and ceremonially commits seppuku (ritual suicide), but Yashida cannot bring himself to die immediately. As he prepares, Logan stops him. Yashida ultimately watches the bomb fall from one of the bombers, and Nagasaki is consumed by a massive fireball. Yashida tells Logan to escape, but Logan tells Yashida to climb down into the pit, as he'll stand a better chance of surviving the nuclear blast below. He makes up his mind and jumps into the pit, followed by Logan. Logan grabs a metal door and covers Yashida with it. Seconds later a wall of fire sweeps into the well, and Logan is consumed by it and horrifically burned. Yashida survives the bombing with only a small burn on his cheek, and watches in horror as the third-degree burns on Logan's body heal before his eyes.Logan awakens in the modern day. He's in bed with Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and she asks him what dream it was this time. ""Nagasaki"" he responds. Logan has bad dreams every night, it seems. The two cuddle, and Logan professes his undying love for her and swears that he'll never harm anyone else. Jean says, ""It's too late."" Logan is horrified to see his claws are embedded in her lower chest and fresh blood is pouring out of her stomach. Logan screams in horror, and awakens from his dream-within-a-dream in a cave in the Yukon.Since Jean's death when the X-Men made their last stand, Logan has lived a primitive, solitary lifestyle. It appears that he lives in the woods like a wild animal, and hasn't bathed or shaved in a while. His small cave has only the basic necessities: empty whiskey bottles and an old radio which is losing battery power. Logan dresses and exits the cave, walking through the wilderness to the nearest town. Along the way he sees a bear's claw mark on a tree and slashes across it with his own claws. Moments later he crosses paths with a mammoth grizzly bear who, for all appearances, is friendly with Logan. Logan comes to the general store, buys some batteries, and watches as a small group of drunk hunters prepares to go up into the mountains. They're green; one of the hunters nearly shoots his foot off as he goofs around with his hunting rifle. Logan is annoyed.Logan returns to his cave and sleeps. Cries of agony ring out and he goes to investigate -- he finds the hunters' campsite destroyed. He sees evidence of a bear attack. He follows bear prints in the fresh mud and comes upon the same bear he'd seen earlier, with an arrow sticking out of its back. The grizzly is still alive and in terrible pain. The bear looks to Logan with tear-filled eyes and Logan is forced to put it out of its misery.Logan plucks the arrow from its' hide and sniffs the tip; it's coated in poison. He stalks into to the town and walks into the local bar (observed by a slight, young red-haired Japanese woman), where he finds the sole surviving hunter recounting the attack. The grizzly killed his companions; he was lucky to escape with his life. Logan, angry at the hunter, asks who shot the bear with illegal poisoned arrows -- because the poison was too low of a dose, the bear went on a rampage instead of dropping dead. The hunter denies using poison-tipped arrows, but Logan continues his accusations. Logan drives the arrow through the leader's hand pinning it to a table, explaining that it was the one he pulled from the bear's back; if it was not poisoned, then the hunter has nothing to worry about.The hunter's friends square off, ready to attack Logan, who is prepared to fight them all, when he is persuaded to stop by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), the red-haired Japanese woman carrying a samurai sword. She teases the hunters, and shows them her sword, explaining that it is hundreds of years old and is called ""Danzan"", ""The Separator"", because its purpose is to separate heads and limbs from bodies. She slices the sword through the air, nearly killing the other hunters in the process, frightening them all, and leaves. Logan leaves with her and climbs into her rental car. Logan asks who she is and why she's been looking for him. She explains that she has been sent by Yashida, whose elderly body is being ravaged by cancer. Yashida wishes to speak with Logan before he dies, and thank him for saving his life 70 years earlier. Logan is reluctant to go to Tokyo, but can't ignore this personal obligation.Logan and Yukio fly to Tokyo and arrive at Yashida's palatial residence. Logan is turned away by Yashida's American oncologist (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and by Yashida's grieving granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto). They insist that Logan's caveman-like state could prove infectious to the elderly, dying Yashida. Logan is unwillingly thrown into a bathtub and cleaned and shaved until he is less offensive and more presentable. Logan is finally allowed to speak to Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), who presents Logan with the same sword he bestowed on him 70 years earlier. Yashida has summoned Logan because he believes his cutting-edge company has the technology to present him with a unique opportunity: they can make Logan mortal, and will transfer Logan's life-giving mutation into his own body. Logan is upset by Yashida's request and argues that no one should want his power. As he begs Yukio to fly him home, he observes as Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada), Yashida's son and Mariko's father, coldly and angrily slaps his distraught daughter. Heartbroken, Mariko aims to throw herself off the nearest cliff, but is saved by Logan, angering Shingen. Yukio persuades Logan to stick around for another day or two, and finds a room for him to stay in.As he sleeps, Logan dreams of Jean who climbs into bed with him and kisses him. As the dream ends, Jean becomes Yashida's oncologist, Dr Green. Her snake-like tongue presses deep into Logan's throat and deposits something causing a green vapor to flow from his mouth. He struggles and is knocked out. Logan awakens, having heard a commotion outside his room. He exits to find paramedics running through the estate. Seconds later, Yashida's dead body is carted to the entrance. Mariko cries and Shingen hurriedly prepares the funeral.Days later, Yashida's funeral is held in the center of Tokyo. Logan arrives with Yukio, and shakily makes his way through the funeral procession. Shingen is especially disgusted with Logan and tells him to go home. Logan and Yukio enter the funeral and stand at the back of the crowd. The ceremony is watched by a lone archer, who quietly whispers to the spirit of Yashida that he will protect Mariko. Mariko is ushered up to the front of the funeral by a pair of traditionally-dressed priests. Logan notices that the priest's arms are heavily tattooed with what are certainly Yakuza markings. Logan impulsively bursts through the crowd, angering Shingen, Mariko, and Mariko's distant fiancé Noburo (Brian Tee). He spots a gun-shaped bulge under one of the priests' robes and within seconds guns are drawn and Logan is shot in the chest. He experiences more devastating pain than usual. All the priests shed their robes, revealing Yakuza tattoos and clothing. The Yakuza grab Mariko and flee the funeral. Logan chases after them. He's shot multiple times, and struggles greatly to regain his stamina; his healing ability is severely impaired. Arrows come soaring into the funeral, laying-out dozens of Yakuza members. The archer, Harada (Will Yun Lee), takes out many of the Yakuza and chases after Logan and Mariko as they flee the funeral temple.Logan takes Mariko deep into the city whilst being chased by the Yakuza. Mariko tries to dismiss Logan from accompanying her, but Logan follows. They board a bullet train and Logan pleads for understanding of what just happened. Mariko explains that in three days time, her grandfather's will is to be read, which will name her (not her father) as the new head of the Yashida corporation. The Yakuza are desperate to kidnap her because it will mean a huge ransom. Logan disappears into the train's bathroom and examines the wounds on his chest; they aren't healing. He shakily exits the bathroom and is met by four Yakuza soldiers who shoot and stab him. Logan retaliates, killing two of the men and ripping a hole in the side of the train. The remaining soldiers are sucked out onto the side of the train, along with Logan, and the three battle one-another at bullet train speed. Logan defeats the Yakuza and returns to his seat in the train. He asks where Mariko is headed. Her family has a home at ""the end of the line"". Logan infers that if there were Yakuza on the train, there are sure to be some waiting for them at their destination. Mariko agrees and the two exit the train well ahead of their destination. The pair walk through the city, in search of a safe place that Mariko is familiar with, but Logan stops her, and explains that they need to find a place to stay where nobody will look for her. Logan finds a seedy-looking hotel and drags Mariko inside. It's a ""love-hotel"", a pay-by-the-hour establishment. Logan thinks it's perfect, because it's the last place the Yakuza would look for them. They pick a ""Mars-themed"" room and hurry upstairs. While Mariko sleeps, Logan stands watch on the balcony. He dreams of Jean, and passes out. Mariko awakens and runs to his aid. Logan awakens in a veterinarian's office. The son of the hotel's manager is stitching up Logan's wounds. He nervously backs away from Logan as he stirs, and gestures to the fresh slashes on his face and arms, all caused by Logan. Logan is stitched-up and in better form than he was the night before, but he's still far from immortal.Dr Green sneaks her way through a seedy back-alley. Her blonde hair draws cat-calls from middle-aged perverts who expect her to be a prostitute. She takes one by the collar and spits green acid in his face, blinding him. She continues through the alley and finds Harada, impatiently waiting for her. She's two hours late and he's angry. She demands to know where Mariko and Logan are. Harada's men are still searching, but Mariko hasn't appeared in any of her usual spots. Green, a mutant who now identifies herself as 'Viper', tells him that they have less than three days to find her.The following morning, Yukio calls Mariko and pleads to know where she and Logan are hiding. Mariko refuses to say, despite her closeness to Yukio, but promises that Logan is being good and is caring for her. Mariko and Logan make their way to Yashida's long-forgotten home in Nagasaki. She doesn't expect anyone to follow them there, because the house is old and in disrepair. They buy groceries and Mariko cooks for Logan. Mariko explains that her engagement to Noburo is an arranged marriage; for powerful and political reasons she must go through with it. She also explains about the solitary archer who she grew up with and has wanted to marry since she was 12. She asks him who Jean is, as Logan tends to repeat that name in his sleep. Logan explains the relationship he had with Jean, how he loved her and why he killed her.They go for a walk, and Logan sees something familiar in the distance: the location of the prison camp, and the well in which he saved Yashida, which has long since been capped. Logan helps some locals chop wood, and begins to shed his gruff exterior, a trait that Mariko finds appealing about her guardian. The two return home and eventually make love. The following morning, Logan wakes and can't find Mariko anywhere. He hears her screaming outside. The Yakuza have found them and kidnapped Mariko. Mariko is thrown into their car and Logan runs after them. One of the soldiers shoots Logan, slowing him down, but Logan manages to pull him from the vehicle. He presses the man to the ground and tortures information of Mariko's whereabouts out of him.Yukio arrives, having followed the Yakuza to Nagasaki, and the pair of them go after the only lead they have: Noburo, Mariko's fiancé. Yukio explains to Logan that she has a gift of second sight or the ability to see death, and that she has seen Logan die with his own heart in his hand. Logan tells her than many have tried to kill him before and that he's still around. They find Noburo in his apartment with a pair of western prostitutes. Logan threatens Noburo, who admits that he and Shingen had an agreement to kill Mariko, and that Shingen has her. Logan throws Noburo off a balcony and into a swimming pool. Yukio and Logan head back to Tokyo. On the way, she tells Logan that she's had a vision in a dream that showed her Logan severely injured and bleeding to death.Mariko arrives at the Yashida estate, where her father is waiting for her. Shingen explains that he has worked his entire life to take over the Yashida corporation once the elderly Yashida dies. When he discovered that Mariko, not himself, would be inheriting the corporation, he conspired with the Yakuza, by way of her fiancé Noburo, to have her killed before the will was read. Had Logan not intervened on the night of her grandfather's death, and allowed Mariko to jump to her death, Shingen would have inherited the company immediately. Shingen, along with his small army of Yakuza, will now find a way to have Mariko killed while keeping his own hands clean.Suddenly, black-suited ninjas descend upon the compound and secretly dispatch the Yakuza. The ninjas are led by Harada and Viper. Shingen is cornered by the ninjas and Viper explains that there are greater forces at work than the Yakuza and him. She spits in his face, severely disfiguring it, and tosses him into a pool. Viper, Harada, and his men take Mariko and disappear.Logan and Yukio arrive and find evidence of the massacre. They make their way into Yashida's private room, filled with high tech medical equipment and x-ray scanners. Logan climbs into Yashida's MRI machine and guides the x-ray over his body and discovers, shockingly, a metallic parasite attached to his heart, implanted by Viper days earlier. The device has impaired his healing ability. Logan, against Yukio's pleas, cuts open his chest with one of his claws and reaches for his heart. Shingen, who had survived Viper's acidic attack, appears dressed in traditional samurai armor. He seeks to kill Logan, and swings his sword at him. Yukio saves Logan, and battles Shingen while Logan reaches further into his chest. Ultimately Logan manages to grab, extract and destroy the robotic parasite, but loses consciousness. He lays on Yashida's bed, with a giant open wound on his abdomen. Shingen bests Yukio, knocking her sword away from her, and aims to cut her in two when Logan's clawed hand suddenly appears, blocking the blow; Logan has healed and gets to his feet and goes after Shingen. Shingen skewers Logan's body with multiple swords, but is unable to kill him. Logan gets within arm's reach of Shingen, but decides to let him live, arguing that he should live knowing that he tried to kill his own daughter. As he walks away Shingen runs after him, running his sword through him. Logan stabs Shingen through the throat, killing him instantly. Logan returns to Yashida's room where Yukio has found Mariko's whereabouts -- a Yashida facility built in the village where he grew up. She also discovers strange robotic designs strewn about the room. Logan takes a Yakuza motorcycle parked out front and heads to the Yashida facility.The facility is high in the mountains. Logan drives into the village and watches as dozens of locals citizens flee to their homes. Seconds later Harada appears, and tells Logan to leave. Logan refuses, so Harada slashes at him. Harada watches in disbelief as Logan's fresh wound heals. Harada orders his ninja-clad men to kill Logan. All at once, arrows attached to ropes come streaming in from the adjacent rooftops, and within seconds Logan is impaled dozens of times. Harada, having dipped the heads of his arrows into Viper's venom, launches them at Logan, weakening him considerably. Logan finally passes out.Logan awakens inside the facility, strapped into a stock, forcing his hands forward and away from his body, unable to move. Viper appears, and congratulates Logan on removing her parasite. Logan hears Mariko screaming his name, and sees a massive, metallic mechanical samurai sitting to his left. To his shock, the mech gets to its feet and walks over to Logan. Viper explains that Yashida had been stockpiling adamantium in recent years, having been obsessed with Wolverine's adamantium skeleton. He built this suit of armor out of the material, and with it, Wolverine can be killed. Viper angers Logan and goads him into extending his claws. As soon as he does so, constraints are clasped onto his hands, preventing him from retracting the claws. Wolverine watches in horror as the giant, mechanical, adamantium samurai approaches him and draws an 8-foot long flaming sword. It positions itself to cut off his claws. Mariko struggles with Harada and stabs him. She runs to Logan's side and distracts the samurai, who slashes Logan's restraints open, allowing him to escape. Yukio, who had followed Logan, arrives at the back door of the facility and sneaks inside. She battles Viper while Logan deflects blows from the much larger and stronger Samurai. The Samurai cuts the claws off of one of Wolverine's hands, revealing bone underneath the adamantium. Logan battles the Samurai one-handed, wrestles its massive sword away from it and slashes the Samurai's helmet off. The out-of-control mechanical samurai slashes open the side of the facility, and pushes Logan out through the hole. Logan dangles hundreds of feet over the ground and hastily climbs back into the facility.Meanwhile Yuriko is battling Viper and losing. Harada, seeing that his actions have been dishonorable, makes a last effort at redemption, killing Viper and himself.Suddenly the samurai's sword comes swooping over Logan's head, cutting his other hand's claws clean off, and the pilot of the mechanical samurai is revealed to be Yashida, the old man thought dead. Yashida explains that his life's goal since meeting Logan was to prolong his own life, at whatever cost. When Logan refused to go through with the procedure at his estate, he faked his own death with the assistance of Viper and kidnapped Mariko, knowing that it would lead Logan to him. Yashida (in the samurai suit) grabs Logan's wrists and six drills come out of the suit's forearms. The needles drill into Logan's exposed bone-claws, straight into the marrow. Within seconds, Logan begins to grow old and Yashida, by way of the interconnected suit, becomes young again. Yashida laughs as he siphons the life from Logan. Mariko has freed herself from Harada and sees and hears her Grandfather's plan. Suddenly one of Logan's separated claws comes flying through the air and lands in Yashida's skull. Mariko confronts her grandfather and stabs him in the head again. Logan is freed from the suit's drills, his life returns to his eyes, and he instantly grows back his bone claws. Logan stabs Yashida, and pushes Yashida, and the suit, out of the facility. It crashes on the rocks below.Yukio, who had survived her encounter with the Viper, joins Logan on an airport runway. The biggest news of the day is that Mariko Yashida has inherited her grandfather's corporation. Mariko kisses Logan on the runway and hints that he should come back to see her soon, but the two agree that they have separate paths to follow. Logan boards the plane and Yukio follows. She gleefully tells Logan to consider her his bodyguard and asks Logan where he would like to go. Logan gives her an indefinite response, but he's happy that she's with him.CREDITS SPOILER:Two years later, Logan (minus Yukio) is walking into an Airport Security checkpoint and asks for the pat down. An overhead TV shows a commercial for 'Trask Industries', and Logan pays little attention to it. Suddenly the coins, watches, and pens in the X-ray machine begin to float. Logan, aware of this magnetic anomaly, immediately ejects his bone claws and spins around to see Magneto (Ian McKellen) behind him. Magneto freezes Logan in place, and urges Logan to lower his defenses. He tells Logan that his mission is a peaceful one, and that he hasn't come alone. Logan turns away from Magneto and watches as everybody surrounding them freezes in place. A wheelchair silently weaves through the sea of frozen bodies, and in its' seat is Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Logan is speechless at seeing Xavier alive. Magneto and Xavier explain they need Logan to save all of mutant-kind."
Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229340/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"With the 1970s behind him, Ron Burgundy, San Diego's former top-rated newsreader, returns to take New York City's first twenty-four-hour news channel by storm. Having left San Diego for New York City, Ron Burgundy is living the high life with his wife Veronica Corningstone and son Walter Burgundy. However, when the boss decides to promote Veronica to full time lead anchor and fire Ron, everything changes. Now heading back to San Diego, Ron is washed up and working part time at Sea World. His shot at redemption though comes in the form of a man named Freddie Schapp, who's an executive producer at the Global News Network, the world's first 24 hour round the clock news channel. He hires Ron, who proceeds to reunite the news team of Champ, Brick, and Brian, and head back to New York City. While there Ron and his news team are given the graveyard shift and a challenge. Ron comes up with a radical new idea to transform the news and that puts him at the top of the game once again. But how long will Ron's newfound fame last? And will Brick finally find true love?—halo1k Will Ferrell returns to the role of Ron Burgundy in Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, which finds the popular San Diego television newsman pulling up stakes with co-host Veronica (Christina Applegate), his intrepid reporter Brian (Paul Rudd), overenthusiastic sports reporter Champ (David Koechner), and imbecilic weatherman Brick (Steve Carell) in order to move to New York City and launch the first ever 24-hour news network.. In the opening shot, a voice-over narrator (Bill Kurtis) tries to continue the legend of Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) by reintroducing Ron as he is frantically swimming away from a shark. Instead, however, the narrator decides to cut to New York City in what is now 1980, where Ron and his wife Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) are walking together down the street. A guy on the street hollers at Veronica to tell her she's got a nice ass. Veronica asks Ron if he's going to say something about it, but Ron acknowledges that Veronica's ass attracts other men.The two are doing the news at the World Broadcast news station. After their broadcast is over, they are called up to meet with their boss Mack Tannen (Harrison Ford). Mack promotes Veronica to full time anchorwoman, and he fires Ron, calling him the worst anchorman he's ever seen. Ron questions what it is that he's done wrong, and we see a number of things in a montage: yelling the news because the teleprompter text was in all caps, cursing on live television and sneezing on the camera lens, among other things. This pisses Ron off all the way back home, where his and Veronica's son Walter (Judah Nelson) can hear his parents arguing. Ron snaps at the boy, telling him he will never achieve his dream of being an astronaut or cowboy and instead ought to aim for working in fast food or in porn. Ron also gives Veronica an ultimatum - either she chooses him, or her job.Six months later, a disgraced and divorced Ron is working as an announcer at Sea World in San Diego. He's holding a glass of scotch, totally drunk, and he starts weeping in front of the crowd at how low he's sunk. He then makes crude comments toward the female commentators, and then starts mocking the dolphins as they do their show. The crowd boos him and he is later fired. He gets dumped in his dressing room by security where his trusty and beloved dog Baxter is sitting. Ron decides to hang himself from the fluorescent light, but his weight causes the light to break. Seconds later, a man named Freddie Shapp (Dylan Baker) enters. He pulls Ron back up and later takes him to a diner to discuss with him a job offer in the city. The Global News Network station is set to have a 24-hour news program, which Ron thinks is a stupid idea. Freddie then shows him an envelope with what would be his weekly salary, causing Ron to exclaim, ""By the hymen of Olivia Newton-John!"" Ron accepts the offer and tells Freddie he's got the perfect news team for the job.Ron first goes to pick up former co-worker and sportscaster Champion ""Champ"" Kind (David Koechner), who was fired from his news team for being a racist misogynist. He now owns a fried chicken joint called ""Whammy! Chicken"", though Ron points out that the chicken is really bat meat. Ron tells Champ about the new job offer, and Champ is on board.Next, Ron and Champ pick up their old field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), who has done well for himself photographing kittens. He likes the idea of live nude strip clubs in New York City, and he joins the two.Ron, Champ, and Brian head off to find weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). Brian informs Ron and Champ that Brick died. They go to his funeral, where their old boss Ed Harken (Fred Willard) and old colleague Garth Holliday (Chris Parnell) are present. Next up to say a few words is... Brick, who is very much alive. He starts yelling and crying to the heavens until his three friends have to remind him that he is alive.On the road to the Big Apple, the gang starts reminiscing about funny stories from their past. Brick tells stories about a dream he had, which none of the others get. Brian then points out that nobody is driving the RV, but Ron thinks that because it is set on cruise control, the RV will drive itself. The RV then steers itself off the road, causing the gang to fly around, while Ron's very misplaced items (a deep fry oil cooker, a terrarium of scorpions, and a bag of bowling balls) fly all over the place and injure them all.The gang makes it to New York and to the GNN station. Freddie shows them around where they find all the regular newscasters, including their top prime time star, Jack Lime (James Marsden). The guys are mesmerized by his good looks, though he makes mean comments to Ron about him staring at him. Jack plays it off as a joke, but he obviously doesn't like Ron. Freddie then takes the guys to meet their new boss Linda Jackson (Meagan Good). The guys are surprised to see that she's an African-American woman who is in charge, but she makes it clear that she will not take any crap from them. She sends them out, annoyed with their childishness and sexism. Freddie tells the guys that they have an apartment booked on the upper east side and that they're in charge of the graveyard shift (2-5am), which they're none too pleased with. As they're leaving, Brick spots a woman, Chani Lastnamé (Kristen Wiig), staring at the phone as it rings. Her boss (June Diane Raphael) is annoyed with Chani's incompetence and answers the phone herself. Chani proves to be just as dimwitted and awkward as Brick, which creates a mutual attraction between the two.Ron goes to visit Veronica to patch things up with her, only to discover that she is now seeing a psychologist named Gary (Greg Kinnear). Ron is annoyed with Gary, and he throws a punch at him, but Gary dodges it, leading Ron to assume that Gary has mind powers. Ron holds a gift meant for Veronica, but, due to his newfound jealousy, he gives it to Walter. It's lingerie for Veronica, but he makes Walter think it's a superhero cape. Ron leaves after making insulting comments to both Veronica and Gary.The gang meets GNN owner Kench Appleby (Josh Lawson), who has a thick Australian accent that makes it hard for them to understand. Jack then proceeds to coolly do the news. Later, Ron makes a comment that Jack isn't so great, which Brick says out loud, angering Jack. He and Ron form a challenge - if Ron and his team fail to beat Jack's ratings, they will leave the city, but if they succeed, Jack has to legally change his name to Jack Lame. He accepts the challenge.The guys have a hard time finding things to report on during their time slot. Ron says that they ought to report on things that people want to hear as opposed to what they need to hear. Freddie likes the idea, and the gang agrees to go through with it. On their way out, Brick runs into Chani again. They have another awkward exchange interrupted when Chani's boss comes in with phone messages from a week ago that Chani decided to mail to her. This turns into a screaming match when Brick yells at the woman to leave Chani alone because they thinks she's going to set Chani on fire. Chani is actually canned, but she doesn't care as she agrees to go on a date with Brick.On their first night broadcasting the news, which the narrator describes as becoming history in the making, Ron kicks it off by addressing how great America is. This gets people's attention from all around the city. Champ does a piece on a number of home-runs while repeating his catchphrase, ""WHAMMY!"" Brick reports on how windy it is outside, and Brian does a piece on the best vaginas in the world. Linda sees this one and immediately rushes off to the station, fuming at the gang's broadcast. Ron threatens to hit her if she were a man, and she challenges him to go ahead and do it. He then hesitates to do so, and then gets kneed in the nuts by her, sending him to the floor squealing like a child, and he and the guys are fired.Kench meets with Linda and Freddie to tell them that Ron's team pulled in higher ratings than Jack has. Linda regrettably tells Kench that she fired them. Freddie goes to the guys' apartment and tells them that they are rehired. During their run, they become celebrities, endorsing several products (Brick does a butter commercial at one point) and bringing in great ratings. Jack even goes through with the name change, which he is ashamed to say on live TV.Linda, turned on by Ron's new celebrity status, tries to make a pass at him, telling him to make weird animal noises. He is unsure of how to go about this and he thinks he's been raped, though he is not too bothered by it. Brick tells the guys he's going on a date with Chani, even though he has no idea what a date entails. Brian offers some help by pulling some condoms out of his ""jimmy closet"". Brick later goes out with Chani to a laundromat. They stand in front of a soda machine and drink can after can of soda. Chani asks Brick if he's ever kissed anybody, to which he says only people on TV and his Planet of the Apes toys. The two share their first kiss, which gets weird, though nobody seems mind it.Meanwhile, Ron and Linda have dinner together, where Ron loudly tells everybody that he's going to have sex with a black woman for the first time. They go back to his place and finally do it, and this scene is intercut with random footage of Jackie Robinson, the Kirk/Uhura kiss from ""Star Trek"", and a clip of ""Diff'rent Strokes"".Kench finds out that Ron and Brian want to do a story called ""Death From Above"", which is a report on the failing Koala Airlines business. He tells Linda about it and wants her to see to it that she can get Ron to pull the story, suggesting they try out some synergy.Linda takes Ron to dinner with her family. He makes a terrible impression by explicitly discussing his and Linda's sex life, along with using stereotypical jive talk. To top it off, he calls them all ""pipe-hitting bitches"", leading Linda's father to kick him in the head. On their cab ride home, Linda informs Ron that they're going to pull the ""Death From Above"" story, and suggests synergy to Ron.What follows is Ron trying to spend time with Walter. He curses in front of him and tells him that the only thing he should be afraid of is voodoo, and that he should never go to Haiti. Veronica hears of this and is pissed at Ron since Walter can't sleep after that. She also reminds Ron that Walter has a science fair the next day, and she wants him to attend.Ron gets tense over what's been going on, especially as Jack reports that Veronica is set to interview a foreign dignitary over talks of world peace. He also tells Brian that they want to pull the ""Death From Above"" story. Ron starts taking out his frustrations on them, eventually yelling at Brick. This sends the others over the edge, and Brian punches Ron in the face. He, Champ, and Brick then leave Ron alone.When Ron has nothing to report, he gets word of a car chase going on. Despite this not being actual news, he goes on air to do this story, just as Veronica is set to do her big interview. The narrator says car chases would become a big deal in the 80's. The ratings for GNN start climbing as Ron does his story, playing on the excitement of the chase as it develops. This also disrupts Veronica's interview as WBC shows more interest in the car chase. By the time the chase ends, Ron has delivered a new ratings high for the station, leading to a big celebration. Unfortunately, he misses Walter's science fair, leaving the boy disappointed.A celebration is held for Ron as he plays the flute while skating to a crowd. His old friends refuse to continue watching him bask in his glory, and they leave. When nobody is looking, Jack tosses a cable onto the skating rink, causing Ron to trip and fall hard on the ice. The narrator likens this to the story of Icarus flying too close to the sun. As a result, Ron becomes blind.Once again without a job and without any purpose, Ron relocates to a lighthouse. Champ, Brian, and Brick come to visit him to try and help him out. He only talks about how his blindness has left him unable to perform any tasks that really don't require vision (he claims to have drank half a bottle of ketchup thinking it was liquor, and he tried masturbating his shin). The guys leave when they realize Ron is hopeless. Not long after, Veronica arrives to get Ron back on his feet. He continues to be unable to perform most simple tasks and only ends up getting frustrated. One day, while on the beach, Walter spots a baby shark trapped in a net. He and Ron set it free, and Walter names it Doby. This gives Ron a new lease on life, allowing him to enjoy time with Veronica and Walter. He helps raise Doby like a pet, even feeding him from a bottle. She also claims to have left Gary because he is too emotionally stable, and it's annoying to her. When Doby becomes a full grown shark, the family releases him into the ocean. Ron even sings a little song for him.Their joy is cut short when Ron discovers a message from the doctor saying that he left multiple messages to try and tell him that they can give him his sight back. Veronica had been deleting the messages so that Ron could continue spending time with her and Walter. She apologizes for being selfish, but Ron angrily leaves. He tries driving but then crashes the car. He undergoes the procedure and regains his sight, allowing him to return to GNN.While Ron is set to do his first big news report since his absence, Veronica goes to visit him and tell him that Walter is going to have a piano recital, and that he wrote a piece for his dad. She also meets Linda, and the two exchange calm yet fiery words to each other, which turns Ron on. Freddie comes in to tell Ron that a TV actress found out about her husband cheating, severed his penis in his sleep, and is involved in a car chase. Veronica understands that Ron would rather do a big news story, so she leaves him to it.Ron prepares to do the news, but he has a change of heart just as he begins. He addresses the audience by saying he's gained a new perspective after his recent experiences, as well as acknowledging how much he needs his friends. Kench is angry at him for not doing the story, and Ron leaves, but not before telling everybody that Koala Airlines ""is a shitty airline"". He apologizes to his friends, with Brick giving a well-spoken lecture to Ron on how his hubris got the better of him. He then adds that he's wearing two pairs of pants. The guys cover for Ron as he runs to Walter's recital.Unable to hail a cab, Ron runs off to the recital. He is ambushed in the park by Jack and his team. They're brandishing axes, ready to get Ron back for humiliating Jack. Just then, Brian, Champ, and Brick arrive to back Ron up with their own weapons (Brick has his trident again). Suddenly, a whole bunch of other news teams arrive, ready to engage in yet another epic news team brawl. There's the BBC news network (led by Sacha Baron Cohen), the MTV news network (led by Kanye West), the entertainment news network (with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler), the apologetic Canadian news team (with Jim Carrey and Marion Cotillard), the history news channel (led by Liam Neeson) and the ghost of Stonewall Jackson (John C. Reilly), and one other news station (led by Will Smith). To top it all off, Mack Tannen reappears to take the form of a were-hyena. The faux Greek goddess Altrusia (Kirsten Dunst) allows for the brawl to start. Heads get bashed, the Canadians hit people with hockey pucks, and Stonewall Jackson steals someone's soul. Brick kills the MTV news team with a futuristic weapon. Baron Cohen hurls his axe at Ron, but it is stopped by Gary, who turns out to really have mind powers, telepathically stopping the axe from hitting Ron, allowing him to run to Walter's recital. Will Smith then calls in a jet to shoot at everybody else.Ron and his friends continue to run but are once again cornered by Jack and his team. Out of nowhere, a group of bikers ride in, led by Ron's rival from the first film, Wes Mantooth (Vince Vaughn). His team empties their gas tanks around Jack's team's feet, and he threatens to drop his cigarette to kill them all. Although Jack points out that this would kill Wes as well, he says that everything he's done in his life would be enough for him to burn in Hell, so he has no fear of burning on Earth. Jack calls off the fight, leading Brick to celebrate with a sparkler. He drops it on the gas, killing Jack, Wes, and both their respective teams. Ron and his guys rush to Walter's recital just as he finishes (they get a little burnt), but quick enough to make Walter think they were there the whole time. Ron runs onstage and holds his boy up proudly.The narrator announces that Ron's leave from GNN brought in their highest ratings. Ron and Veronica also reconciled, and they attend Brick and Chani's wedding on the beach. Walter then spots Doby swimming in the ocean. Ron runs out to sea to embrace the shark, thinking he fondly remembers him. Actually, Doby tries to attack Ron. Ron swims away in a panic, and he is saved by none other than Baxter. The brave little dog bites Doby in the side and banishes him. Ron hugs Baxter, even though the dog barks that he wonders why he still maintains their friendship. Everybody else cheers for the two.After the credits is an outtake of the gang going to plan their first broadcast. Brick crawls under the table to eat a cookie from the floor. He looks at the camera and waves at the audience."
Lone Survivor,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091191/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Marcus Luttrell and his team set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah, in late June 2005. Marcus and his team are left to fight for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare. Marcus Luttrell, a Navy Seal, and his team set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah, in late June 2005. After running into mountain herders and capturing them, they were left with no choice but to follow their rules of engagement or be imprisoned. Now Marcus and his team are left to fight for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare.—Jose Tinto In 2005 Afghanistan, Navy SEALs Marcus Luttrell, Michael Murphy, Danny Dietz and Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson deploy on a mission of surveillance and to take out Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. Though spotted by goatherds, Luttrell and his team decide not to kill them. But one of the Afghans alerts a group of Taliban fighters to the invaders, and a terrible battle ensues, in which the SEALs find themselves hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned.—Gerry Garcia The year is 2005. In the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, the War in Afghanistan is well under way when military intelligence learns that a senior Taliban member is hiding out in a remote village deep in the Hindu Kush mountains of the Kunar Province. Convinced that his capture or killing could turn the tide of the difficult war in favor of the United States, the Navy SEALs hatch Operation Red Wings. The goal is simple -- send a select team of soldiers to stake out the village from the surrounding mountains, and move on their target when the time is right. Under the leadership of Lieutenant Michael Murphy (Kitsch), Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg), Matt Axelson (Foster), and Danny Dietz (Hirsch) reach their checkpoint, and quickly realize that another nearby hill will provide a better vantage spot. Shortly after arriving at that new location and getting a positive ID on their target, however, the soldiers are caught off guard by three wandering shepherds, including a young boy. Ultimately, a heated vote over what to do with the captured shepherds leads Lt. Murphy to decide that the best course of action is to abide by the rules of engagement, meaning that the soldiers will abort the mission, release the captives, and retreat to their extraction point. Shortly after the shepherds are set free, however, the four SEALs find themselves surrounded by dozens of Taliban soldiers, and engaged in a fierce gunfight that -- with the aid of some truly brave villagers -- only one of them will make it out of.. In Afghanistan, Taliban leader Ahmad Shah is responsible for killing over twenty United States Marines, as well as villagers and refugees who were aiding American forces. In response to these killings, the United States Navy SEALs are assigned to perform a counter-insurgent mission to capture Shah. As part of the mission, a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team is tasked to track Shah's whereabouts. The four SEAL teammates are team leader Michael P. ""Murph"" Murphy; hospital corpsman and sniper Marcus Luttrell; sonar technician Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson; and communications specialist Danny Dietz.The team is inserted into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they make their trek through the mountains. Upon arriving at their designated location, the SEAL teammates are discovered by an elderly shepherd and two teenage goat herders. After much debate, Luttrell convinces the others that they will receive backlash if they kill the three herders. The team releases the herders, and as they attempt to abort the mission, they are ambushed by Taliban forces. They kill several approaching Taliban members, but find themselves too heavily outnumbered. All four men take a number of serious injuries during the firefight, and in an attempt to flee from the insurgents, they jump off the edge of a cliff.Despite their injuries, the SEAL team runs through the woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shout questions to Luttrell, unknowingly relaying the SEAL team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another cliff to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is shot in the shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains at the top of the cliff, in the custody of Shah and the Taliban insurgents who surround him. Murphy plots to climb back up the mountain in order to receive a phone signal to make an emergency call, via a satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters, while covering Murphy. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the Navy SEAL base of his team's location, but is shot dead by several Taliban fighters.In response to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team attempts to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert SEAL teammates who were riding in one of two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, the Taliban insurgents shoot down one of the helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board; the second helicopter is able to escape. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to kill several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land at the bottom of a rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.Luttrell awakens the next day and runs to a nearby village, where he is discovered by local Pashtun villagers. One of the villagers, Mohammad Gulab, takes Luttrell into his home and sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces of Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Luttrell and Gulab are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. The remaining Taliban fighters are chased away by American forces, who arrive via helicopters and bring Luttrell to safety.Photos of the real-life Marcus Luttrell, Mohammad Gulab and the fallen soldiers who died during the mission are shown during a four-minute montage, and an epilogue reveals that the Pashtun villagers agreed to help Luttrell as part of a traditional code of honor known as the Pashtunwali."

When the leader of Pakistan is assassinated, the U.S. president (Jonathan Pryce) calls on the Joes to secure Pakistan's nuclear warheads before they fall into enemy hands. In the wake of successfully completing their mission, however, the Joes are decimated in a devastating surprise attack. When the smoke clears, Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) are the sole survivors. They're convinced that something is amiss in the White House, and as Lady Jaye theorizes that an impostor is pretending to be the commander in chief, bad guys Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-Hun) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) team up to break Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) out of prison. Later, as Storm Shadow retreats into the mountains to recover from burns incurred in the extraction, Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) manage to capture the elusive white ninja, in the process discovering a shocking secret about his past and learning that Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), posing as the president, has called an international summit to discuss nuclear disarmament in order to bring the leaders of the world to their knees before the diabolical Cobra Commander. Now, as Cobra holds the entire globe hostage with a revolutionary new weapon placed on satellites orbiting the planet, it's up to the Joes and a trustworthy old friend to save the day.. After a successful mission in international territories, the G.I. Joes realize too late that their next assignment is a set up by their nemesis Cobra, who have successfully infiltrated the US government. Zartan is masquerading as the President and the malicious Cobra Commander has the world leaders at his knees as part of his diabolical plan to launch nuclear missiles upon innocent countries. Being the only surviving Joes in a deadly attack, Roadblock, Flint and Lady Jaye must recruit the legendary General Joe Colton to helping them uncovering Cobra's plot and saving the world from total annihilation.—Blazer346 The G.I. Joe team is framed for crimes against the country by Zartan, disguised as the President, and Cobra Commander has all the world leaders under his influence, with their advanced warheads headed towards innocent populaces around the world. Outnumbered and outgunned, the surviving team members form a plan with their original leader, General Joseph Colton, to rescue the President and face off Cobra Commander, his accomplices and the world leaders.—Anonymous DMZ, North Korea: Duke (Channing Tatum), Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), and Flint (DJ Cotrona) are breaking through a security fence, in full view of a North Korean occupied guard tower. Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) is keeping an eye out and Mouse (Joseph Mazzello) is serving as a standby sniper. Roadblock uses some supercharged gloves that get so hot they melt the woven wire fence so the men can get through. On signal, Mouse shoots a coffee mug from the hand of one of the guards to create a diversion and the three scamper on to their destinations. Roadblock and Duke go to where some buildings and vehicles are and they capture/rescue a man from the back of a truck. Meanwhile, Flint has gone directly onto the guard tower and replaced the N. Korean flag with that of the G.I. Joe's.There's a brief narration explaining how the Joes caught Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) and Destro (in the previous film), and they are now locked in a maximum security prison. Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) are still at large. Duke is the captain, charged with leading Roadblock, Flint, Jaye, and the masked mute Snake Eyes (Ray Park). (Note: no mention is made of the Baroness whom is presumed to be still incarcerated).After completing their mission in Korea, Duke and Roadblock are playing video games at the Roadblock's home. Duke gets jumped on playfully by Roadblock's two young daughters, distracting him from the game as he must stop to wrestle with them.Duke and Roadblock pause briefly to watch a news story on television about the Pakistani president having been assassinated.Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce), meets with his advisors and asks for opinions about what the U.S. should do about the situation in Pakistan. A pentagon general recommends going in. A civilian advisor recommends waiting it out. The Zartan president decides to send the G.I. Joes to Pakistan to capture and neutralize a nuclear device the government had developed so it can't be used by those who assassinated the Pakistani president.The Joes travel to Pakistan. They are lowered onto the roof of the building where the weapon is located. They fan out and within short order, locate the weapon on the ground floor and start shooting their way into and down the four levels of the structure. Within minutes, they have control of the building and the weapon and remove it from the country. Duke contacts the White House to confirm this.Zartan enters an underground facility where the Cobras are hiding the real President. Zartan taunts the President and shows off the nanomites that keep his disguise together, by taking a knife and drawing it across his face. The skin changes color but quickly heals itself. Zartan observes that the people of America prefer a President who looks like the real one, but acts like Zartan is acting, bold and aggressive, with a penchant for blowing things up.At their compound in the desert, Duke and Roadblock make a bet on who can shoot the flame of a candle in a cupcake perched on top of a stick. Duke goes first, but misses because Roadblock keeps talking and taunting him. Roadblock then pulls out a massive machine gun and blows apart the entire cupcake, claiming victory. Duke now has to baby sit Roadblocks two daughters for one night.Suddenly, the men notice a group attack helicopters approaching and they think maybe it's additional security. However, the helicopters start shooting at the Joes and dropping bombs. They destroy all the vehicles and kill numerous people. The team scrambles for protection while firing back. Duke jumps in to save Flint, but he is killed in an explosion. Roadblock, Flint, and Jaye hide in a deep water well and manage to escape detection.The next morning, as the trio struggle to climb out of the well, President Zartan addresses the nation regarding the attack. He accuses the Joes of attacking Pakistan and stealing a nuclear weapon. He also accuses Snake Eyes for the assassination of the Pakistani president. Zartan announces on television that the G.I. Joes have been eliminated as a result of all their misdeeds.Roadblock, Flint, and Jaye finally get out of the water well. As the only surviving Joes, they take off on foot across the desert, set on exacting revenge for their dead.At a maximum-security prison in Germany, Snake Eyes has been captured and is being taken in to join Cobra Commander and Destro in captivity. He is escorted by Warden James (Walton Goggins) to a room deep underground where he is placed in a tube filled with a liquid medium that paralyzes every part of the body but allows the heart and eyes to remain functioning. James says, ""Welcome to hell"" and then removes Snake Eye's mask, revealing that it is really Storm Shadow and not Snake Eyes.A Cobra mercenary known as Firefly (Ray Stevenson) comes roaring up to the facility and sets out little explosive fireflies to break into the place. As this is happening, Storm Shadow makes his heart stop to alert the guards after he's been placed in the chamber. He manages to break out and kill most of the guards. He breaks Cobra Commander from his chamber, but they leave Destro, saying he is out of the band. They meet with Firefly, who comes in as James shoots a gas chamber, causing an explosion. James is killed by the Commander and the explosion's flames severely burn Storm Shadow's back.Cobra Commander directs that Storm Shadow be taken to a temple high in the Himalayas to recover from his injuries.In Tokyo, Japan, upon learning that Storm Shadow is alive, the Blind Master (RZA), leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends the real Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Elodie Yung), Storm Shadow's cousin, to capture Storm Shadow and get him to reveal Cobra's plans, and also to answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master.The villains go to an industrial complex where a large weapon known as Zeus is being constructed. President Zartan comes in and informs Cobra Commander about the three surviving Joes. Firefly says they'll be taken care of.Roadblock, Flint, and Jaye drop by Roadblock's old neighborhood. They take shelter in an old gym/arcade that he used to frequent.After President Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as America's main protective unit, Lady Jaye does some technical analysis of the known President's speech pattern and mannerisms with that of the suspected imposter, deducing that someone is impersonating the real president. Flint asks Roadblock who in government they can possibly trust now, and he responds there is one man he knows.Roadblock leads them to the home of General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), the original G.I. Joe. Roadblock explains the situation after showing Colton the dog tags of their fallen brothers. Together, they come up with a plan to prove that the President is a phony.Colton provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan. They escape after a brief confrontation with Firefly and Zandar (Matt Gerald), the head of the Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra.Jaye goes out pretending to be jogging home with her groceries and attracts the attention of a man on the President's detail. She tricks him into helping her out with her groceries, and Roadblock gets him to find them a way to the President.High in the Himalayas, Snake Eyes and Jinx have located the place where Storm Shadow is being treated. He has healed up by an old woman, and as he is getting dressed following removal of his bandages, he notices that several ninjas are falling past the window from great heights. As he rushes out to see what's going on, he comes across Snake Eyes in the passageway. They engage in a fight, while Jinx appears in the other room and fights the old woman. The old woman and Storm Shadow are subdued after some furious fighting. Snake Eyes and Jinx bundle Storm Shadow into a body bag and fasten the bag to a rope. Numerous ninjas appear and go after Snake Eyes and Jinx in an attempt to rescue Storm Shadow. After numerous battles along the sides of the mountains as they and the Ninjas slide on their ropes and rappel along the rocks, Snake Eyes and Jinx manage to escape. They return to Japan.Back in Tokyo, Storm Shadow is questioned by Blind Master, who hands him his sword. In this moment, it is revealed that, as a child, it was not Storm Shadow who killed his and Snake Eyes' master, but it was Zartan in disguise as a man who would mentor Storm Shadow into the assassin he became. Storm Shadow reveals that he joined Cobra to avenge his uncle. He gives them the information they want.Storm Shadow then accompanies Snake Eyes and Jinx as they join the Joes' efforts to stop Cobra.At the fundraiser that President Zartan is attending, Jaye goes in disguised as a member of the President's detail. She gets in with a sexy red dress and gets Zartan's attention. One of his men, another Cobra ally, is suspicious and starts to do a scan on Jaye's face. She gets out after getting a hair sample from Zartan's coat and sends it to Roadblock. After scanning the sample, they learn Zartan's identity, just as Firefly comes in and tries to attack. He fights Roadblock and almost kills him until Flint and Jaye come by and ram him with their truck. Firefly gets out in time.In the gym/arcade, Snake Eyes, Jinx, and Storm Shadow come across the Joes, who are initially suspicious, but they join forces. They go back to Colton's place and meet with some of Colton's men to come up with a plan to stop Cobra's plans. Colton shows them his HUGE collection of weapons all over the kitchen and they start preparing.Firefly is beating the President up in the underground chamber. Cobra Commander comes in with a briefcase that would activate the Zeus weapon and scans the President's eye in order to gain control of the weapon.Zartan invites the leaders of the world's nuclear powers to a summit at Fort Sumter, where he blackmails them into disabling their nuclear arsenals by first launching America's nukes into the air and then detonating them as they are high above the sky to show his commitment to disarmament. The other world leaders had also launched their missiles and then follow suit in destroying them. It's then that Zartan reveals that he has created Project Zeus: seven orbital kinetic bombardment weapons of mass destruction, that are at his command.They launch one rod at London, almost completely destroying it, and sending the other world leaders into a frenzy. He threatens to destroy the other capitals if the leaders don't submit to Cobra. By this point, Cobra has officially taken over the White House. Storm Shadow betrays Cobra Commander and kills Zartan, revealing Cobra's deception to the world leaders. While Snake Eyes, Jinx, and Flint fight Cobra's soldiers, Cobra Commander activates the remaining six weapons and instructs Firefly to protect the briefcase containing the launch device. Firefly is killed in combat by Roadblock, who deactivates and destroys the orbital weapons.Roadblock comes in on a fast attack tank shooting the other villains' tanks while Jaye and Colton go retrieve the President. After shooting their way through dozens of goons, the duo find the underground chamber as one Cobra ally holds the President at gunpoint. Jaye shoots the President in the arm to drop him out of the way and Colton then kills the goon.Flint goes in pursuit of Cobra Commander, but he escapes on a helicopter, just as his men are preparing for the other Zeus rods to hit other major cities around the world. Roadblock finds that Firefly is holding the briefcase. He nearly escapes on a motorboat, but Roadblock rams into it with another one. He and Firefly begin fighting again, but Roadblock manages to defeat him. At the very last second, he overrides the sequence and causes all the Zeus satellites to explode.Somewhere underground, after having escaped other ninjas, Storm Shadow finds Zartan pointing a gun at him. He tells Zartan he made him what he has become, and Zartan pulls the trigger, but Storm Shadow slices the bullet in half with his blade and throws it into Zartan's chest. As he dies, the nanomites wear off, and his real face is visible.Roadblock is walking away from the scene, but Firefly is about to set one of his firefly bombs on him. He reaches into his pocket for his detonator, but Roadblock is holding it. With the push of a button, the firefly explodes, and Firefly is killed. The Joes walk together triumphantly while Storm Shadow respectfully acknowledges Snake Eyes and walks away.The real President is put back into power and addresses the nation at a ceremony where Roadblock, Jaye, Flint, Jinx, and Snake Eyes are commemorated as heroes. Colton thanks each of them, but when he gets to Roadblock, he presents him with a M1911 pistol that belonged to General George S. Patton, to use when he finally finds Cobra Commander. Roadblock proudly raises the weapon and lets out a single shot in honor of his fallen comrades."

One year later, the four magicians have declared themselves an official troupe known as ""The Four Horsemen"" and are now sponsored by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine). They are performing onstage at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. For their final trick, they declare that they are going to do something that has never been done before on any magic stage: they are going to rob a bank. The crowd is very enthusiastic, and there are a large number of volunteers who seem to have a vendetta, so Daniel declares that they are going to select a volunteer at random. Merritt, Henley and Wilder go around with bowls of ping pong balls to allow the audience to make the selection. Wilder tosses Daniel a ping pong ball with a letter B, which tells them which section to choose a volunteer from. Merritt then tosses a '5' ball, to give them a row to choose from, and lastly, Henley tosses a '13' ball, and the man seated in seat B513, a Frenchman named Etienne Forcier (Jose Garcia), stands up.Etienne says on the mike that his bank is the Credit Republican de Paris. While Etienne is making his way to the stage, Daniel takes the time to point Tressler out in the crowd and express the Horsemen's gratitude towards him for sponsoring them. On stage, Etienne is briefed by Merritt, while Wilder fits him out with a teleportation helmet. Daniel then hands Etienne a set of playing cards, and has him pick a card at random. He then has Etienne sign his name in English on the card he chose (a red two of hearts).The troupe now conjures a teleporter in the middle of the stage. They have Etienne climb onto the platform. Merritt reminds Etienne that it's 11:50 PM now in Las Vegas and 8:50 AM in Paris, so his bank will be opening in about ten minutes. They then activate the teleporter, and Etienne seemingly is successfully teleported off the stage.In Paris, at the exact same moment, to be precise, Etienne stands up in the vault of his bank. Video cameras built into the helmet and a microphone allow him to communicate with the Las Vegas stage. He sees a big pile of money in the middle of the room, approximately three million euros worth. Daniel instructs Etienne to put the card he just signed on the floor in the middle of the money pile, along with his ticket stub from the performance. He then tells Etienne to push a button on the side of his helmet. The button activates an air duct that vacuums up the entire pile of money.Moments later, bank employees arriving for work at that bank open the vault and discover the safe is indeed empty, with only the card and ticket stub on the floor. Meanwhile, their money is being showered on the Las Vegas crowd.FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is called to investigate the theft and is partnered with Interpol Agent Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent). Alma has already deemed interrogation useless, but Dylan decides to do the interviews himself. Etienne insists on his innocence and sincerely believes he was transported to France, but it is soon discovered he had been hypnotized, after Etienne suddenly acts like he's in a philharmonic orchestra upon hearing Dylan say the word ""Bullshit"".They interrogate the Four Horsemen next, Jack is at ease enough to sleep, while a bored Henley ""magically"" makes her opposite chair spin. Merritt turns the interview against them, pointing out the secrets that Alma is hiding and how Dylan has abandonment issues, likely because of his father (important later in the film). Daniel's interview creates the most tension, as he taunts Dylan with the fact that the police have no proof and that the Four Horsemen will always be ahead. Unable to arrest them when the only explanation they have for the theft is ""magic"", the police are forced to release their suspects.While Dylan stews over this, an officer runs up to him and eagerly tells him that one of the audience members was Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman)--an ex-magician who makes money by revealing the secrets behind other magicians' tricks, Thaddeus had actually recorded the show and figured out how the heist was done. He takes the police back to the stage, where he puts Dylan through the volunteer audience member's position and explains how the man was ""transported"" to Paris. The Four Horsemen stole the money weeks before, and manipulated the audience into believing it happened in real time. The ""French"" bank vault to which Etienne was apparently transported was a duplicate beneath the stage: he merely dropped through a trapdoor. And Etienne himself was not chosen at random: the magicians had palmed ping pong balls with his seat number which they exchanged for the ones picked from the bowls.This was only the start, as Thaddeus knew there was more coming and warns Dylan to be prepared for the magicians' next performance in New Orleans. Dylan asks Thaddeus to help the police arrest the four, but Thaddeus refuses and leaves. As Thaddeus prepares for his next video, Arthur Tressler approaches and tries to bribe him into staying out of the Four Horsemen's rise to fame. Again Thaddeus refuses, and Arthur threatens to bring the ex-magician to ruin. Arthur's demonstration of the threat however has Thaddeus warning him instead to be careful as it may be Arthur who will be ruined.The press is soon reporting the sold out show for the Four Horsemen's debut in New Orleans. Perhaps made aware of Thaddeus's presence, the magicians demonstrate the secret of the common disappearing rabbit trick. They then move to original stunts, including soap bubbles strong enough to send Henley flying through the air and Merritt hypnotizing twelve ordinary people to believe they are football players ready to tackle the quarterback upon hearing the command ""freeze"". For the finale they invite Arthur on stage and empty his bank account, distributing it to the audience that comprises people whose insurance claims had been denied or reduced by his company. The excited yells from audience members receiving alerts from their banks about the deposit draws chaos.Arthur tries to go after the magicians, only to find himself chained to the stage. Dylan runs up the stage to arrest the Four Horsemen and shouts ""freeze!""--they then escape with help from the hypnotized ""football player"" audience members. The police chase the magicians through the streets but are ultimately tricked. Only Alma comes close as she manages to corner Daniel with her gun, but seeing him unarmed and frightened causes her to hesitate, allowing Daniel to escape.Although Dylan blames her for letting Daniel go, Dylan knows Alma was probably the only person not fooled by the Four Horsemen into running in the wrong direction. Finally more receptive to her opinions, Alma tells him about the rumors of a magicians' secret society called ""The Eye"". They were a group of magicians similar to Robin Hood; stealing from the rich, giving to the poor, often dependent on illusions and great leaps of faith or even blind obedience. Dylan is skeptical, but then Alma starts drawing comparisons to a particular magician, one who Thaddeus exposed. That man was so humiliated he attempted a complex underwater stunt that went awry, yet a body was never found. The heists might have been a mere distraction in the bigger picture, something that Thaddeus understands when an infuriated Tressler speaks to him. Arthur hires Thaddeus to expose and humiliate the Four Horsemen in their next performance.Things are tense before the Four Horsemen's last performance in New York City. They are still following instructions from their mysterious benefactor, but worried that after everything is accomplished their benefactor will abandon them to the police. As the youngest, Jack is most panicked and the others order him to follow the plan. The police arrive and surround the building--Jack is left alone to destroy all remaining evidence, but Dylan and his partner discover his hideout. What evidence he couldn't burn Jack grabs and tries to flee, but Dylan and his partner are in hot pursuit. The magician attempts to escape in a stolen car, and the car chase is broadcast live before Jack loses control of the vehicle. When the car flips and skids to a halt Dylan tries to get him out, but can only take the evidence before the car explodes in flames.The remaining three of the Four Horsemen post an online video mourning Jack's loss but resolve to continue their final act in New York. From the papers Jack had tried to destroy, Dylan and Alma learn that the Four Horsemen are targeting a particular safe which is under the surveillance of another FBI team. Alma has no jurisdiction, and with the Four Horsemen's consistent ability to outwit Dylan, another FBI team leader takes over the case. The team rush to where the safe is stored, only to find the room empty. As it turns out, another FBI agent had been hypnotized to give instructions for the safe to be transported. The team escort the safe to the destination, only to meet up with Thaddeus. Thaddeus tells them to check the safe. Inside the safe they find only balloons, the Four Horsemen have outsmarted them again. By now, Dylan is convinced there is a fifth member of the team, potentially Alma or Thaddeus.""5 Pointz"" is where the final performance is to be held. Dylan once again attempt to arrest the Four Horsemen but the three escape by using holograms, dummies, and even jumping off a rooftop. Money again rains from the sky into the cheering crowd, but it turns out the money is fake. Knowing that the story of the Four Horsemen is now over, Dylan resigns himself to let it go and explore his feelings for Alma instead. Meanwhile, Thaddeus returns to his car, only to discover it is filled with the real money from the stolen safe. The FBI show up and arrest Thaddeus for being part of the plan.In prison, Thaddeus tells Dylan that he was framed. He explains how the Four Horsemen performed the safe heist through the use of mirrors and then faking Jack's death with a duplicate ""standard issue"" FBI car, but can't figure out how they managed to set everything up by themselves. He realizes then that there was a fifth horsemen and it was not him or Alma but Dylan. Dylan was the mastermind of the entire plot, though Thaddeus is unable to determine why. Dylan tells Thaddeus he wants him imprisoned in the bars forever, trying to figure out why. He leaves to reunite with the Four Horsemen, who are stunned to learn that he is the mysterious benefactor who brought them together. He initiates them into ""The Eye"".Back in France, Alma finds an old newspaper article slipped in her current paper. The article is about the magician who attempted the underwater trick and drowned, leaving his family penniless. Dylan appears and confesses that he is the son of the drowned magician. He designed the Horsemen plot to obtain revenge on those involved: Thaddeus, for humiliating his father; the bank in Paris and Tressler's company, which refused to pay insurance on his father's death; and the safe-producing company that produced the safe used in his father's trick and the Horsemen's final act. The company may have made good bank safes, but for the safe Dylan's father used they used an inferior quality of metal, causing it to warp and contributing to his death. Dylan was living in poverty until The Eye recruited him. He admits that he had planned everything, but did not plan on meeting and falling in love with Alma. Although she briefly considers turning Dylan in, ultimately she chooses not to.In a mid-credits scene, the Horsemen drive to a desert junkyard, and find a set of locked crates with the symbol of the Eye."
The Wolf of Wall Street,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the true story ofJordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government. Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) is Long Island penny stockbroker who serves almost two years in prison for refusing to co-operate in a huge 1990s securities fraud case that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including mob infiltration. Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) narrates the film showing his monstrous success with his firm complete with ribaldry at work, a sumptuous home on the Gold Coast of Long Island and a trophy wife who is a former model. He then flashes back to 1987, where he began a low-level job at an established Wall Street firm. His boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) advises him to adopt a lifestyle of casual sex and cocaine to succeed. However, shortly after he passes his exam to become a certified stockbroker, he loses his job on account of the firm's bankruptcy as a result of Black Monday.Now unemployed in an economy that is unaccommodating to stockbrokers and sufficiently discouraged to consider a new line of work, Jordan's wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti) encourages him to take a job with a Long Island boiler room dealing in penny stocks, which are also largely ignored by regulators. Belfort impresses his new boss with his aggressive pitching style, and earns a small fortune for the boiler room and himself as penny stocks have a much higher commission than blue chips. Jordan also befriends Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), a salesman living in the same apartment complex and they decide to go into business together. To facilitate this, his accountant parents are recruited as well as several of Jordan's friends, some of them experienced marijuana dealers. The basic method of the firm is a pump and dump scam. To cloak this, Belfort gives the firm the respectable WASP like sounding name of Stratton Oakmont. An article in Forbes dubs Jordan the ""Wolf of Wall Street"", and soon hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company.A decadent lifestyle of lavish parties, sex and drugs follows. Jordan regularly uses prostitutes and becomes addicted to cocaine and Quaaludes. FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) begins investigating Stratton Oakmont. When Jordan meets Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) at one of his parties, he begins an affair with her, resulting in his divorce from Teresa. Jordan makes Naomi his second wife in an extravagant wedding and gives her a yacht aptly named Naomi, and soon they have a daughter, Skylar.Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission works jointly with the FBI to intensify the Stratton Oakmont investigation.
Jordan instantly makes US$22 million on his securing the IPO of Steve Madden Ltd. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with the corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel (Jean Dujardin) in the name of Naomi's aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), who is a British citizen and outside the reach of American authorities. He uses friends with European passports to smuggle cash to Switzerland. When Donnie gets into a public fight with Brad Bodnick (Jon Bernthal), who is one of their money couriers, and Brad is arrested, their scheme is nearly exposed.Donnie offers Jordan a powerful brand of Quaaludes, hoping to ease the sting of the bad news. The pills are old and seem to have lost their potency, so they take huge doses to compensate. Jordan then receives a call from Bo Dietl, his private investigator, who insists Jordan call him back from a payphone. Jordan drives to a country club to phone Bo, who warns Jordan of Brad's arrest and that his house phone has been wiretapped. At this point, the Quaaludes finally kick in with overwhelming effect. Severely debilitated, Jordan drives back home to prevent Donnie from using his phone. When Jordan arrives home Donnie (who is also high) is on the phone with Saurel. Jordan fights Donnie to make him get off the phone and tells him he found out what happened between him and Brad. Donnie starts choking on ham and nearly suffocates. Jordan snorts cocaine to counteract the effect of the Quaaludes in order to help save Donnie's life.With the shadow of law enforcement hanging over them, Jordan's father Max (Rob Reiner) attempts to convince his son to step down from Stratton Oakmont and escape the large amount of legal penalties. However, during his leaving party at the office, Jordan changes his mind and to the great acclaim of his employees vows to stay on.Jordan, Donnie and their wives on a yacht trip to Italy learn that Emma has died of a heart attack. Over his grieving wife's objections, Jordan decides to sail to Monaco so they can drive to Switzerland without getting their passports stamped at the border and settle the bank account, but a violent storm capsizes their yacht. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed by a seagull flying into the engine, exploding and killing three people. Witnessing this, Jordan considers this a sign from God and decides to sober up.Two years later, Denham arrests Jordan during the filming of an infomercial. Saurel, arrested in Florida over an unrelated charge, has told the FBI everything. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency.Jordan is optimistic about his sentencing but after one last bout of sex, Naomi tells Jordan she will divorce him and wants full custody of their children. Jordan throws a violent tantrum, gets high, and ends up crashing his car in his driveway during an attempt to abscond with their daughter.The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work. Jordan silently slips Donnie a note warning him about the wire. The note finds its way to Agent Denham, who arrests Jordan for breaching his cooperation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont.
Despite this one breach, Jordan receives a much reduced sentence for his testimony and is sentenced to 36 months in a minimum security prison in Nevada. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique."
The Butler,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327773/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As Cecil Gaines serves eight presidents during his tenure as a butler at the White House, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, and other major events affect this man's life, family, and American society. Cecil Gaines was a sharecropper's son who grew up in the 1920s as a domestic servant for the white family who casually destroyed his. Eventually striking out on his own, Cecil becomes a hotel valet of such efficiency and discreteness in the 1950s that he becomes a butler in the White House itself. There, Cecil would serve numerous US Presidents over the decades as a passive witness of history with the American Civil Rights Movement gaining momentum even as his family has troubles of its own. As his wife, Gloria, struggles with her addictions and his defiant eldest son, Louis, strives for a just world, Cecil must decide whether he should take action in his own way.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Cecil Gaines, a black man married to Gloria Gaines, is determined that neither of his two sons, Louis and Charlie, will ever have to know what it's like to be the offspring of a cotton picker like he is, he having witnessed slave-like abuses afflicted on both his parents by their white land owner employers when he was a child. Despite the less than happy circumstances which led him and to which he had to endure on this path, Cecil, as an adult, has worked in commercial wait situations to the white man, largely in upscale establishments, he learning that he has to be two faced in his approach to work, often supporting racist statements made or untruthfully answering racially charged questions by employers or customers while being accommodating but somewhat invisible as a human being. In 1957, he is offered - much to his shock - and accepts a position as an under butler at the White House among the black domestic staff, after a White House administration staffer sees and is impressed with his demeanor and work at the Excelsior Hotel in Washington DC. This appointment begins an approximate thirty year employment at the White House, one that is not always smooth for Cecil either on a professional or personal level. On the professional side, the White House is sometimes just a microcosm of what is happening in the world, his employment setting where he has to be even more careful in what he says or does. On a personal level, he is often at odds with his family. Louis decides to head to the front lines of civil rights activism, often placing himself either in personal danger or in situations still considered criminal. And Gloria may not see Cecil's time at the White House as worth the neglect it causes for their home life.—Huggo In 2009, an elderly Cecil Gaines recounts his life story while waiting at the White House to meet the newly inaugurated president. In 1926, at the age of seven, Gaines is raised on a cotton plantation in Macon, Georgia. When the farm's owner rapes Cecil's mother, Cecil's father confronts him and is killed. Cecil is taken in by the estate's caretaker, who trains Cecil as a house servant. In 1937, at age eighteen, Cecil leaves the plantation. Desperately hungry, he breaks into a hotel pastry shop. The elderly master servant, Maynard, takes pity on Cecil and gives him a job. Cecil learns advanced serving and interpersonal skills from Maynard, who later recommends Cecil for a position in a Washington, D.C. hotel. While working there, Cecil meets and marries Gloria, and the couple has two sons: Louis and Charlie. In 1957, Cecil is hired by the White House during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration. White House martyr d'hotel Freddie Fallows introduces Cecil to head butler Carter Wilson and co-worker James Holloway. Cecil witnesses Eisenhower's reluctance to use troops to enforce school desegregation, then his resolve to uphold the law by racially integrating Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas.. This film tells the story of Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), a White House butler who served eight American presidents over three decades. The film traces the dramatic changes that swept American society during this time, from the civil rights movement to Vietnam and beyond, and how those changes affected this man's life and family."

On the way there, their car is rammed off the road by a guy named Marshall.

Marshall wants it back, and has kidnapped Doug in order to send a message to the Wolfpack. Their mutual acquaintance Leslie Chow, who made off with half that gold, that very night, has escaped from a Thai prison and has headed back to North America.

They attend an intervention, in which Alan agrees to visit a rehab facility in Arizona, so long as ""the Wolfpack"" takes him there. On the way to Arizona, Phil's minivan is rammed off the road by a rental truck and the group is taken hostage. They are later confronted by mob leader Marshall (John Goodman) and ""Black Doug"" (Mike Epps), his head of security.He tells them that Chow hijacked half of a $42 million gold heist and, seeing how Alan has been the only one to communicate with Chow during his imprisonment, deduced that the Wolfpack could locate him and retrieve the gold. Marshall kidnaps Doug as collateral and gives the others three days to find Chow, or else Doug will be killed. Alan sets up a meeting with Chow in Tijuana, Mexico, where Stu and Phil will hide and attempt to drug him. However, Alan gives away their location and he forces them to confess they are working for Marshall. Chow explains his plan to retrieve the stolen gold from the basement of a Mexican villa he previously owned. Stu, Alan and Phil break into the house and successfully retrieve the gold, but Chow double-crosses them by locking them in the basement, rearming the security system and escaping in Phil's minivan. They are arrested but mysteriously released from the police station, where they are picked up by a limousine and taken back to the villa, where they meet up with Marshall.They learn that Chow had lied to them; the villa was never his and the gold they stole was the other half he didn't get from Marshall.

Phil and Alan sneak into his suite from the roof, but Chow escapes, jumping from the balcony and parachuting down to the strip. Stu catches up to Chow and locks him in the trunk of the limo that Marshall had lent to them. They take the gold and meet with Marshall, who releases Doug back to the group.

Luckily, Alan had freed Chow through a backseat compartment just moments earlier.Chow emerges from the limo and kills Marshall, allowing the Wolfpack to live because Alan had saved his life. He offers Alan a bar of gold as a gift, but Alan turns him down, and ends their friendship due to Chow's unhealthy influence on the group. As Chow sadly watches them leave, they go to retrieve Phil's minivan from the pawnshop and Alan makes a date with Cassie. Six months later, the two marry. Vowing to begin taking responsibility for his actions, Alan regretfully resigns from the Wolfpack, but would still like for the gang to hang out on occasion. As the four walk to the ceremony, a montage of clips from the previous films play, thus ending the film. In a post-credits scene taking place the morning after the wedding, Alan, Cassie and Phil appear to have staged another wild party that they cannot remember.

Captain Phillips,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535109/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The true story of CaptainRichard Phillipsand the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the U.S.-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years. Captain Phillips is a multi-layered examination of the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award®-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.—Sony Pictures Entertainment When a cargo freighter passes just outside Somalian waters, some men in a motorboat approach the freighter and start shooting at it. The Captain, Richard Phillips deduces they're pirates so he tries to keep them off the ship but fails. They come on board so Phillips instructs the crew to hide. The pirates go to the bridge and tell Phillips they want money and when Phillips offers what they have which is about $30,000, the leader has his mind set on getting millions. He plans to take the crew hostage and hold them for ransom. But since they are hiding he goes off to find them. Eventually the crew captures the leader. His companions who have Phillips, demand they be allowed to go in the lifeboat. They let them but they keep Phillips. They try to go to Somalia but the U.S. Navy arrives and tries to stop them even if it means losing Phillips.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) and his crew are carrying freight around the Horn of Africa when four Somali pirates forcefully take over their ship, the MV Maersk Alabama. While Phillips' team follow his orders to hide until they hear him give the safe word, the captain and a few essential crew members remain on the bridge as the heavily armed pirates make their way up to seize control of the ship. But the interlopers soon discover something that sends them into a furious rage: After effectively shutting down the ship, Phillips explains that the Maersk had malfunctioned when the crew pushed it too hard in an attempt to evade the attackers. In order to appease their leader, the ruthless Muse (Barkhad Abdi), Phillips offers them the $30,000 that's been locked in the ship safe. But that isn't enough, and Muse demands that Phillips help him search every corner of the ship to root out the terrified crew. When that plan fails, the pirates agree to take the cash from the safe and flee in the Maersk's lifeboat. At the last minute, however, they kidnap Phillips in the hope of supplementing their take with a sizable ransom -- a decision that leads to a tense standoff with the U.S. Navy, who would sooner see the lifeboat sunk with Phillips inside than allow it to reach Somalia.. Assigned the dangerous task of taking the unarmed container ship, Maersk Alabama, from Oman to Mombasa, Kenya, the American navigator,Richard Phillips, and his crew see their worst fear come true, in 2009. Off the coast of Somalia--for the first time in maritime history--an opportunistic gang of armed-to-the-teeth Somali pirates seize the American vessel, demanding millions as ransom, dragging Alabama's men, the brazen pirates, and the U.S. Navy in a five-day cat-and-mouse game. As the Navy SEALs of the USS Bainbridge are on standby, Captain Phillips' ship approaches Somalia. Will they get out of there alive?—Nick Riganas On March 23, 2009, at a home in Underhill, Vermont, Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is packing his bags, checking his passport, and confirming his itinerary before he heads to the airport with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener). On the way, they express their concern over the changing times and wondering how their children will fare, as they know that it's a much different world than the one they grew up in and it's not as easy to find a good job. They arrive at the airport, kiss each other goodbye and Phillips heads inside as Andrea drives away.Meanwhile, on the coast of Somalia, a group of vans filled with local mercenaries arrives at Eyl, a small village. A young boy hurries to wake up Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who is sleeping on the hard ground inside a rudimentary hut. The boy tells Muse that ""they are coming."" The mercenaries are angry that the villagers haven't provided them with any money for their boss, a warlord named Garaad, since the previous week, and they are ordered to get in their boats and go find something.Hufan (Issak Farah Samatar) is the local village boss. He operates a fishing trawler (the mother ship) that was hijacked from the Taiwanese the previous year, and two smaller skiffs that are used to chase down and hijack large oceangoing ships. For this trip, Muse and another skiff leader named Asad (Mohamed Ali) are told by Hufan to select three men each and get their skiffs ready. The men all gather around and noisily attempt to get Muse or Asad to choose them. If they have a skill and/or something to use for a bribe, they'll be more likely to be selected. Usually, the bribe is a sprig of the plant known as khat, which when chewed causes excitement, loss of appetite, and euphoria.Muse chooses Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman), Elmi (Mahat M. Ali), and a quiet but forceful man named Najee (Faysal Ahmed) for his crew. The other Eyl villagers are surprised that Muse chose Najee, as he isn't from their village.The men load the skiffs with long homemade ladders, water, and fuel, then push the skiffs into the surf and power them up for the ride out to the mother ship. Asad tells Muse to stay out of his way ""this time."" He derogatorily refers to Muse as a ""skinny rat."" Muse obviously doesn't like Asad and also doesn't appreciate it when Asad starts ordering his man Elmi around.Captain Phillips arrives at the Port of Salalah in Oman and takes command of the MV Maersk Alabama, a commercial container ship that is home ported in Norfolk, VA. As he makes his way up to the bridge, he notices that almost all of the ladders, hatches and doors are unlocked and fully accessible.Phillips says hello to his first mate, Shane Murphy (Michael Chernus), who informs Phillips that their orders call for them to sail through the Gulf of Aden and round the Horn of Africa to Mombasa, Kenya. He also provides details of their cargo. They are carrying 2500 tons of commercial cargo, 200 tons of food, 166 tons of fresh water and 250 tons of bunker fuel.Wary of pirate activity off the coast of Somalia, the Captain Phillips orders Murphy to ensure that all doors and hatches are locked throughout the ship and kept locked, even when in port. After completing the loading of its cargo, the ship departs on its voyage.Hufan checks the radar on his fishing boat and sees that there is a large number of ships in the main channel, but it would be risky to try and take one among all the others of the ""herd."" He notices one ship that is separated from the rest. It's the Maersk Alabama, and that will be their target.Captain Phillips orders emergency drills to take place at sea so the crew will be as prepared as possible should something happen. Not long after starting their first drill, Captain Phillips glances at the ship's radar screen and notices two small blips. He goes outside and takes a look through his binoculars. He returns inside and orders Mr. Murphy to return to the bridge.The captain informs Murphy about two approaching skiffs and orders him to contact the U.S. Maritime Emergency to advise them. There is no response.
Captain Phillips orders the ship to turn five degrees to port to see if the skiffs follow. They do. Phillips then orders Murphy to contact the UK Maritime Trade Operations (MTO) to inform them of a possible piracy situation. The female MTO officer tells Phillips to lockdown the ship and get the fire hoses ready. She advises him to follow established protocol in dealing with any potential pirates, although she suspects these may just be fishermen. Phillips tells her the men approaching are not there to fish. The skiffs have gotten close enough for Phillips to see they are armed.Captain Phillips alerts his crew of 20 men and tells them to get to their stations. Realizing the pirates probably have a maritime radio, he picks up his own radio and pretends to contact a military ship, Coalition Warship 237. He masks his voice to represent the pretend responding military official. The pirates listen as Phillips first announces that the weapons aboard the Maersk Alabama are ready for use and then, as the pretend military official, that a helicopter or plane will be overhead within five minutes.Asad (Mohamed Ali) believes what he hears on the radio and orders his skiff to turn around and quit the chase. Muse, however, doesn't believe what he's heard and orders his driver to speed up. Captain Phillips orders his chief engineer, Mike Perry (David Warshofsky), to bring their speed up to maximum and to alternately turn to port, then starboard. The wake of the ship created by doing that rocks the smaller boat, but Muse orders Elmi to push the much faster skiff on at full speed. They are nearly to the Maersk Alabama when the engine on the boat gives out, leaving them stranded.Phillips addresses his crew and tells them they are still going through with their mission as planned and that they'll need to perform double shifts. Several crew members are frightened and say they didn't sign up to fight pirates, whom they are convinced will be returning. They suggest heading further out to sea to put even more distance between them and the Somalai coast. Captain Phillips informs the crew that there are five bands of pirates operating off the coast and out in the open ocean, so they can't avoid them, therefore the Maersk Alabama will remain on course and rely on its superior size and established protocol to ward off any pirates. If need be, they'll take refuge, lock down, and wait for help from the military. He advises that if anybody wants to leave, they will have to wait until they get to Mombasa and fly home from there.Phillips sends an e-mail to Andrea to keep her updated on the voyage, and tells her that he's breaking in a new crew and, to avoid worrying her, that the days are ""ordinary.""That night, Muse and his men work from the mother ship in an attempt to fix the engine on his boat. The mother ship is continuing to follow the Maersk Alabama. Muse is not happy that Asad chose to give up the chase earlier. When Asad yells at Elmi to hurry up and fix the engine for his ""crew of women,"" Muse suggests that Asad give them his engine. Asad says, ""shut up, Skinny, you talk too much."" Muse responds, ""I may be skinny, but I am not a coward."" This enrages Asad, who points his gun at Muse's head and demands that Muse repeat what he just said. Muse secretly grabs a nearby wrench, then moves quickly to knock Asad's gun hand down then bringing the wrech up to whack Asad over the head, knocking him out, perhaps killing him. The blow prompts Najee to remark that ""the coward is the first one in the grave.""
Muse and his men then take over Asad's boat and, after fixing their damaged engine, add it to their new boat, dramatically increasing the horsepower. The following morning, Muse and his men are back at sea and are closing fast on the Maersk Alabama again. Phillips had just finished showering and is called to the bridge by Murphy who informs him that one skiff has returned.Phillips orders the crew to their stations and orders evasive maneuvers. He contacts the UK MTO again and advises that they are under pirate attack. MTO says that it will contact the military.When the skiff gets within several hundred yards, Phillips orders the fire nozzles activated to spray outwards. There are large amounts of firefighting water being sprayed all around the circumference of the ship. If the small skiff gets too close, it will likely be filled with water and sink.Muse uses his radio to tell Phillips to stop the ship, that he and his men are the Somali Coastguard and there to help them and they want to come on board. When the ship fails to stop, or even slow down, Muse directs Najee to fire his weapon. He then has Elmi steer the boat towards a gap in the firewater spray along the port side of the ship. He then points his own rifle and fires at Phillips and another crew member who are staring at them from the bridge.Phillips had directed Murphy to get down to the main deck and fix one of the fire hoses that wasn't working right and left a gap in the perimeter. Murphy manages to do that, but he's nearly shot by Najee in the process. Phillips then orders Murphy to get down to the engine room and take charge down there.Phillips then opens up an emergency kit and extracts two large red flares. He ignites them and directs the flares towards the skiff. They just miss.The firewater doesn't prove to be a deterrent as Bilal unlashes the homemade ladder and with help from the others is able to hook it over the side of the railing of the cargo ship. Each man, in turn, then jumps onto the ladder and scurries up the side and onboard.Captain Phillips orders the majority of the crew to get down to the engine room, to lock the hatches, split up, and hide. He tells them not to open the door or come out unless they hear him give the secret password, ""suppertime."" He doesn't want them to become hostages.The pirates shoot away any locks they encounter, including that on the door of the bridge. They barge in and point their guns at Phillips and the other remaining crew members. Muse approaches Phillips and tells him to relax, that nobody needs to get hurt, that he and his men are just there on business and once they get paid, everything will be ok.Muse asks Phillips where the ship is from. Najee is ecstatic when the captain tells them the ship is American. Muse asks Phillips where he's from. Phillips tells him he's an Irishman from America. Muse decides he will call Captain Phillips ""Irish"" from then on. Muse announces that he is the captain now, then asks what sort of materials the ship is carrying, other than food and water.Phillips tells Muse that there is $30,000 in the ship's safe and he can have it if he and his men will leave. Muse acts insulted and says, ""$30,000, do I look like a beggar?"" Actually, Muse may very well have been tempted to take the money and run, but he knew that would never be acceptable to Garaad.The power to the ship goes down suddenly (the chief engineer had flipped the main switch off), and the emergency power kicks on. Muse demands to know what's going on. Phillips tells him the ship has broken for some unknown reason. Muse walks along the control panel, randomly poking at switches and buttons, which makes Najee very nervous and he tells Muse to stop.Muse wants to know where the rest of the crew is. Phillips feigns ignorance and says he doesn't know where they are, that he's been working on the bridge. Muse tells Phillips that no one will get hurt as long as he doesn't try to play games with him. Muse tells Phillips to order his crew to come to the bridge, then decides to speak to them himself, via the intercom. He announces that if the rest of the crew doesn't come out of hiding, he will begin shooting those on the bridge, one man every minute.Muse directs Najee to grab Officer Ken Quinn (Corey Johnson), and prepare to shoot him in the head after one minute goes by. Phillips pleas with Muse that if he must shoot anyone, he ought to shoot him, since he's the captain. Phillips confronts Muse and asks him if this is how he conducts a business transaction, by killing people? Muse ponders that and decides to search the ship instead of killing anyone. That disappoints Najee, who strongly believes in doing whatever seems necessary to get what they want as quickly as possible.With his thumb secretly holding down the radio transmit button on his walkie-talkie, Phillips tells Muse that searching the ship will be fine, as long as they don't lose their emergency power, causing the ship to go completely dark. Muse tells Phillips that he wants ""no games"" during the search for the crew. Murphy catches on to the captain's hint about the ship's lighting and directs Perry to get up to the main deck and shut off the emergency power, while he goes to the galley to get them some food and water.Bilal and Muse go with Phillips to search for the crew. Phillips suggests they conduct the search of the ship from the top down, but Muse quickly catches on to his tactic, and after perusing a diagram of the ship, he directs Phillips to take them to the engine room, which he figures is the source of the ship's being broken.Along the way, Muse allows for a stop at the galley to get some water, as it will be hot in the engine room. By then, Murphy was already in the galley and has to quickly take cover when he hears them coming. Murphy avoids detection and after Phillips, Muse and Bilal have moved on, he uses his radio to call his crew in the engine room to warn them that the search party is on the way. He further advises that one of the pirates (Bilal) is barefoot and to spread some broken glass at the entrance to the engine room.When the search party reaches the engine room, Bilal steps through the door first and right onto the broken glass, severely cutting his foot. Muse directs him to continue on. However, after while, it's obvious that Bilal is bleeding too much to continue, so Muse orders him to take Phillips back to the bridge and send Najee down.Meanwhile, Muse continues the search alone. Some of the crew members ambush Muse. During the struggle, Muse cuts his hand on a knife one of the men was wielding. The crew then radio the pirates on the bridge to tell them that they have Muse and they will exchange him for Captain Phillips and a promise that the pirates will take the $30,000 and leave. Muse is ordered to verbally agree to those terms and to do it over the radio so his men can hear. On the bridge, Najee is opposed. He wants millions of dollars, but he's overruled by Muse.Phillips removes the $30,000 from the ship's safe, places it in a bag, and hands it over to the pirates. Najee demands that Captain Phillips go with them in the lifeboat. Phillips doesn't agree to go, but he does enter the lifeboat to show Elmi how to operate it. Meanwhile, the crew has released Muse so he can get into the lifeboat. When Phillips turns to exit the lifeboat, Najee hits him and knocks him down, then slams the door shut. Elmi then releases the lifeboat and it plunges down to the ocean.The USS Bainbridge, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, is currently assigned to the Counter-Piracy Task Force 151, operating in the Mediterranean Sea. The commanding officer (CO) of the Bainbridge, Frank Castellano (Yul Vasquez), is contacted by Admiral Howard and informed of the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and subsequent taking of Captain Phillips as a hostage on the lifeboat. Admiral Howard tells the CO he is to proceed west and intercept the lifeboat and pirate mother ship. It's an 820 mile trip.On board the lifeboat, the pirates begin arguing. It's hot in the lifeboat and there's a lack of khat to chew on. Muse tells Phillips that the men are normally fishermen, but the big ships came and took all the fish from their offshore waters.Phillips offers to treat Muse's hand and Bilal's foot injuries. Muse refuses treatment but allows Phillips to tend to Bilal. Phillips talks to Bilal, observing how young he is and wondering how Bilal got himself into this. Phillips applies antibiotic and starts to wrap the foot. He nonchalantly pulls out a knife to cut the bandage, causing Elmi to yell out in alarm. Najee grabs the knife away from Phillips and orders Bilal to move away from him.A ScanEagle drone from the Bainbridge locates the lifeboat, the pirate mother ship, and the Maersk Alabama, all within a few miles of each other. The crew of the Alabama had decided to follow the lifeboat and their captain. The crew on the Bainbridge determine that it will take about 36 hours for the lifeboat to reach Somalia, only 126 miles away at that point.Admiral Howard tells the Bainbridge CO that the White House wants a resolution to the hostage matter and that two other U.S. ships, the Halyburton (frigate) and Boxer (amphibious assault ship), along with members of S.E.A.L. Team Six, were being sent to assist. The admiral made it clear that if Captain Castellano proved unable to resolve the matter peacefully, the seals would take care of it. In any event, the lifeboat was not to be allowed to reach Somalia.Phillips asks for a drink of water, so Bilal gets him some. After he takes a deep drink, Najee sees him and grabs the jug away, telling Bilal that Phillips is to receive no more water.Muse keeps trying to radio contact Hufan, but is unsuccessful. Eventually, Hufan calls him and tells him that the mother ship is experiencing engine trouble and that Garaad is not happy that Muse screwed up the mission. Garaad was directing that Muse take the lifeboat directly to port in Somalia. That also appeared to be an effort to preserve the mother ship and keep it from being captured.At the S.E.A.L. Staging Base in Virginia, the members of S.E.A.L. Team Six board a C-130 for their long trip to the west coast of Africa.Muse tells Phillips that last year, he captured a Greek ship and received $6 million in ransom. Phillips sarcastically wonders why Muse was attacking his ship if he'd already gotten $6 million for the Greek ship. Muse just looks at him and tells him to shut up.The USS Bainbridge arrives and rudely announces itself to the men on the lifeboat by shining spotlights and blasting its emergency horns. When Muse opens the door to reveal the sight of the Bainbridge, Phillips sees it and gets a big grin on his face.A man calling himself Nemo (Omar Berdouni), is on board the Bainbridge. He speaks Somalian and communicates with the pirates, telling them he works for the Navy. He offers them food and water as a start to the process of negotiating the return of Captain Phillips. Muse tells Nemo that the demand is $10 million. Nemo tells Muse that it won't be easy, but they can discuss it.Sailors from the Bainbridge board the Maersk Alabama to assume control of the ship. A Lt. Hicks tells Murphy that they will escort the ship to Mombasa and safety, assuring them that the Navy will take care of the situation with Captain Phillips.Phillips tells Muse that the Navy is not there to help him, nor to negotiate with him.Najee is suspicious of everything that the Americans say or do, believing they are lying and setting them up. Nevertheless, Muse agrees to meet with the Navy.The CO sends Nemo and a number of armed men on two gunboats over to the lifeboat. Before doing anything else, they want to make sure Phillips is ok. Muse orders Phillips to the door of the lifeboat so they can see he's fine. Phillips asks the Navy members to contact his family and tell them he's ok, that he's sitting in seat 15 on the lifeboat (the first of three seat number mentions that the pirates fail to view suspiciously).Muse pushes Phillips back inside the lifeboat and continues speaking to Nemo. He refuses the offer of food and water. He just wants $10 million. He's also upset that a crewmember is video recording what's taking place.Najee becomes increasingly agitated at the course of the conversation going on outside until he raises his pistol, close to Phillips's ear, and fires it through the roof of the lifeboat. The gunboats are immediately ordered to pull back, as the CO fears that Phillips might have been shot. Muse quickly contacts the Bainbridge CO and tells him that Phillips is fine, then puts Phillips on the radio to confirm. Muse tells the CO that he'll speak to them again once they are in Somalia.After dark, the USS Halyburton and USS Boxer arrive.Phillips tells Muse that he needs to take a piss, so Muse allows him to step out of the lifeboat. Bilal is already outside. Phillips tells Bilal that the saltwater would be good for his injured foot and when Bilal looks down to consider that, Phillips pushes him into the water, then jumps in himself. He starts swimming toward the Bainbridge, and the navy crew members spot him and Bilal in the water, but they are unable to identify if one of the two is Phillips, because it is too dark.Najee aims his rifle at Phillips and tries to kill him so he won't escape, but Muse orders him to pull back. Muse then jumps in the water and swims out to Phillips and attempts to pull him back into the lifeboat. Phillips loses his shirt in the process. Rather than risk being shot by Najee, Phillips decides to get back on the raft. Once he's on board, Najee kicks and punches him and Muse has to pull him off before he kills Phillips.The Seals have parachuted from the C-130 and arrive at the Bainbridge via rubber raft about 0400, about the same time that Phillips has re-boarded the lifeboat.A Navy helicopter flies over the lifeboat and lights from it and the ship illuminate the little boat. The Bainbridge CO orders Muse and his men to surrender. Najee is upset that they are being bossed around so much and he wants Muse to do something to reassert control of the situation. Muse responds by grabbing Phillips and forcing him through the door, holding a pistol to his head. He then aims the pistol at the helicopter and fires off a few rounds. The helo turns away and Muse and Phillips go back inside.Muse then orders Bilal to get out the large yellow survivor suit from the floorboards of the lifeboat and then holds the pistol to Phillips's head again. He then orders Phillips to speak into the radio and inform the CO that he is going to be shot and the survivor suit will be used as a body bag.
The S.E.A.L. Commander (Max Martini) assumes tactical command of the overall operation and he speaks to Muse, informing him that he is the official negotiator on behalf of the Americans. He refers to his notes and begins naming each of the pirates and where they are from. Muse and the others are very much alarmed by that. The negotiator also convinces them that elders from their tribe are being brought to the Bainbridge and are going to assist in arranging for the ransom for Captain Phillips. He says that they don't want the exchange of Phillips for the money to be witnessed by the elders, and they want to conduct the negotiations out of sight of Phillips.The plan is to tow the lifeboat to the exchange point. Najee advises Muse that it's an ambush. Nevertheless, Muse agrees to go over to the Bainbridge and meet with the Navy and the elders as the negotiations take place.The S.E.A.L.s position themselves on the helicopter deck of the Bainbridge, armed with sniper rifles.Phillips tries again to convince Muse to give up, before they are killed. Muse responds ""I got bosses and they got rules."" Phillips says, ""we all got bosses. Muse tells Phillips that the mission was supposed to be simple: hijack the ship, get the ransom, and nobody would get hurt, but that he'd come too far to give up now. Phillips says ""there must be something other than being a fisherman and kidnapping people,"" to which Muse replies, ""Maybe in America, Irish. Maybe in America.""A skiff from the Bainbridge goes out to the lifeboat to attach a tow rope and pick up Muse. They also surreptitiously attach a listening device to the outside of the lifeboat. While there, a bag containing a yellow shirt is tossed over. It's a shirt for Phillips. The man tossing the shirt also advises Phillips that he should put on the shirt to keep warm and to make sure and stay seated in the same seat he had been sitting in. He again tells Phillips to stay in the same seat, as they are leaving.The objective of the S.E.A.L. snipers is to obtain confirmed sightings of each of the three pirates on the raft and take them out. Optimal sighting range is 91 meters. The lifeboat is over 200 meters out, so it needs to be towed closer.The S.E.A.L. Team Commander orders high speed maneuvering, which requires the Halyburton and Bainbridge to travel the same direction, but somewhat offset, at high speed. That would create a large wake that would bounce the lifeboat around. The negotiator then tells the pirates to steer in the wake of the Bainbridge to smooth out the ride, which would then put the lifeboat in optimal position for the snipers.After the Bainbridge initiates the tow of the lifeboat, Phillips puts his yellow shirt on. Elmi doesn't like the fact that Phillips is moving around and Najee yells at Phillips to sit still. He tells Elmi that if Phillips moves again, to shoot him. The men on the Bainbridge hear that.As the Bainbridge tows the raft ever closer, the Seal snipers try but can't get confirmed sightings of each of the three pirates.Phillips sees an ink pen on the floor and, after checking that he's not being looked at, quickly grabs the pen and starts to write one last note to his family on some scrap paper. Bilal sees him and pleads with him to stop or Najee will kill them both. Najee then sees Phillips writing and grabs the paper from him. This infuriates Phillips and he attacks Najee, pushing and punching him. Bilal and Elmi have to pull Phillips off Najee. Najee orders them to tie Phillips up.The S.E.A.L. Team Commander orders the speed of the tow increased as he realizes time may be running short.Najee gets on the radio and demands to know where the elders are. He comes to realize that the elders aren't coming and the Americans have been deceiving them all along. Believing they are all likely to die anyway, Najee prepares to execute Phillips. Men on the Bainbridge witness Phillips being strung up and blindfolded, and advise the S.E.A.L. Team Commander.Phillips begs the pirates to give up, to just put their hands up. He pleads on behalf of Bilal, observing that Bilal is just a kid. Najee ignores him. Phillips then starts announcing out loud that he loves his wife, apologizing to her for his being out there rather than home with her.By then, there are two confirmed sniper sightings of the pirates (Bilal and Elmi), but Najee is still not in sight. The S.E.A.L. Team Commander then orders the tow stopped. That causes Najee to stumble forward and into view through a window. That provides a visual on all three pirates and the order to execute is carried out immediately. Blood sprays all over Phillips and he screams. Everything then falls deathly quiet, the only sounds being Phillips's whimpering, as his blindfold falls from one eye and he is witness to the scene. He goes into shock.The order is given to take Muse down. He is immediately put on the deck, cuffed and arrested. Muse asks if his friends have been killed. A Navy officer informs him that Captain Phillips is safe and the other three are dead. Muse hangs his head.Phillips is removed from the lifeboat and taken to the Bainbridge where he is treated for his wounds in the medical department of the Bainbridge by HMC O'Brien (a real-life Navy Corpsman 2nd class named Danielle Albert). The chief asks Phillips if he is hurt and inspects his wounds, including those on his face, head, under his arm, and around his wrists from being tied up. He has trouble responding to her, but when she asks him all the blood on him came from his own wounds, he seems incredulous that she would think so and says no. He becomes overwhelmed with shock and distress and the chief and another corpsman lay him down. Phillips asks if his family knows that he is safe and the chief tells him that they know and he will be able to call them soon. She assures him that everything will be okay.The epilogue states that Captain Richard Phillips was reunited with his family on April 17, 2009. Abduwali Muse was charged with piracy and sentenced to 33 years the federal correctional facility in Terre Haute, Indiana. In 2010, Captain Phillips went back to sea."
Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3063516/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"86-year-old Irving Zisman takes a trip from Nebraska to North Carolina to take his 8 year-old grandson, Billy, back to his real father. Eighty-six-year-old Irving Zisman is on a journey across America with the most unlikely companion: his eight-year-old grandson Billy, in ""Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa"". Jackass characters Irving Zisman (Johnny Knoxville) and Billy (Jackson Nicoll) will take movie audiences along for the most insane hidden camera road trip ever captured on camera. Along the way Irving will introduce the young and impressionable Billy to people, places, and situations that give new meaning to the term ""childrearing"". The duo will encounter male strippers, disgruntled child beauty pageant contestants (and their equally disgruntled mothers), funeral home mourners, biker bar patrons, and a whole lot of unsuspecting citizens. Real people in unreal situations, making for one really messed up comedy.—Paramount Pictures PR Upon learning that his wife of 46 years has died, horny granddad Irving Zisman is eager to get out and sow his geriatric oats. Irving's lecherous journey is soon threatened, however, when his crackhead daughter shows up at the funeral with his grandson Billy in tow. It seems that Billy's mother has gotten in trouble with the law once again, and she needs Irving to drive him across the country to be with his deadbeat dad -- who only agrees to take the boy after learning that he'll receive $600 a month in government support. Determined not to let the little runt get in the way of his good times, Irving stuffs his wife's corpse in the trunk of his classic Lincoln town car, plops Billy in the passenger seat, and hits the road, making occasional pit stops to engage in some bawdy hidden-camera antics along the way.. In the opening shot, an eight-year-old overweight boy, named Billy (Jackson Nicholl), is sitting in the waiting room of a law office. He reads a magazine and turns to a page with a picture of a guy fishing. Billy turns to the lady next to him and says he'd like to live in that spot next to the jail house since his mom is going there for getting caught selling drugs. His mom then comes out to grab him and tell Billy they're going to see his grandpa.We meet the enderly Irving Zisman (Johnny Knoxville) sitting in the waiting room of a hospital, checking out a magazine of his own and getting aroused at the sexual imagery. A nurse comes in to tell Irving that his wife had taken a turn for the worst, and she is now dead. After a brief moment of silence, Irving starts laughing, overjoyed that his wife is dead. He talks to his penis ""Leroy"" and says ""We're free!"" Irving leaves the hospital to get himself off, but unfortunately for him, the massage parlor and strip club are closed. Desperate, he sticks his penis in the slot of a vending machine. That's when he gets himself stuck and starts asking onlookers for help. He tries pulling his penis out, stretching it to an unnatural length before someone steps in to help.Irving attends his wife Ellie's (Catherine Keener, as a corpse) funeral with a whole group of strangers. He is surprised to see them all though he admits he and Ellie outlived all their friends. Just as he starts giving a speech, Billy and his mom Kimmie (Georgina Cates) barge in and Kimmie pulls Irving out to talk to him. She has a loud conversation with him saying she's going back to jail for violating her parole, and she orders Irving to make sure Billy stays with his father. Irving reluctantly agrees and they re-enter the church. Kimmie starts to steal a pearl necklace from Ellie's casket, but Irving goes to stop her. Their struggle ends up pushing Irving into the casket, spilling Ellie's corpse onto the floor to the horror of everyone in attendance.Irving takes Billy to a restaurant to meet with a counselor while they contact Billy's father Chuck (Greg Harris) via webcam to inform him of the current circumstances. Chuck turns out to be a deadbeat jerk who refuses to take Billy in as he cannot afford to. He proceeds to take a hit from his bong as his girlfriend comes in to remind him that he can get child support for Billy, so he instructs Irving to take Billy down to Raleigh, North Carolina to drop him off with Chuck by Sunday at 2:00.Irving later starts selling Ellie's belongings. He tries to sell her bed to a potential customer and then offers to test it out. He hands her a pad with a button to adjust the bed, but once she presses it, the bed folds rapidly, bending Irving repeatedly. The customer is then too freaked out to buy the bed. Later, Irving calls a couple of unwitting guys to come help take the bed out, though he really asks them to help him and Billy carry Ellie's body to the trunk of his car, since he felt that she needs to be taken south to be buried properly. Though disturbed, the two men help them and then leave before they are implicated in a crime.Irving and Billy hit the road not long after getting everything together. Billy says he's hungry, so Irving pulls over to a nearby market where a woman is selling food. He tries to hit on her while Billy goes on a kiddie ride outside the shop. He tells Irving that it's not working, forcing Irving to test it out. He ends up getting shot through the window as the ride springs off it's base, startling everybody else. Frustrated, Irving tries to ship Billy off to North Carolina in a box. He takes him to the post office, but because Billy keeps moving and speaking, the two women in the place open it and are shocked to find him in there. Before he can get in anymore trouble, he says he'll just take Billy back on the road.Irving leaves Billy in the car as he goes to a rec center to play Bingo with other older folks. Irving starts to drink the ink from the markers before pulling out a margarita maker and blending drinks for everybody. He mentions that he visited a country where lemon juice was squirted on a man's penis to determine if he had a disease, then proving his being clean by squirting lemon juice on his own penis. Irving then proceeds to hit on the women there, making them laugh or repulsing them. Meanwhile, Billy leaves the car to walk around and stop an older gentlemen to get him to tie his shoe. He keeps him talking for a few minutes while trying to coax the man into adopting him.The two stop in a supermarket when Billy gets hungry again. Irving takes food out from their containers and makes himself and Billy sandwiches, which is seen by the employees. A woman comes out to chastise Irving for eating without paying and criticize him for influencing Billy. Still, Irving gets Billy to smuggle some items and run from the manager, who yells at Irving even as he tries flirting.The two pull into a motel for the day. They pull Ellie's corpse out of the trunk since Irving thinks it would be disrespectful to leave it in the car, all while another man watches them in displeasure. Irving then asks the man if he knows where there is a strip club around here so he can seduce a black woman. The man points him out to one and he leaves Billy in the room.Irving goes to a club featuring male performers. He tells one of the dancers that he plans on waiting until the women are so aroused by the dancers for him to swoop in and make his move. He starts talking to a group of women, making them laugh despite is crass behavior. When the men start to dance, Irving jumps on the dance floor and pulls down his pants, revealing his balls that sag past his thighs. Everybody runs away while laughing in surprise and disgust.Meanwhile, Billy leaves the motel room to find Irving. He goes to another strip club and then to an adult book store. The book store employee offers to watch him while they find his grandpa, and Billy tells her that she looks like a stripper, naming her Cinnamon. Irving eventually comes back home before they have to hit the road again.As they near North Carolina, Irving tries to use Billy as bait to find a woman to hook up with. The women they speak to find Billy adorable, but they all turn Irving down. They drive to a diner where Irving drives the car into a large penguin statue, knocking it over and arguing with one of the employees about fixing it. In the diner, Billy asks why he has to stay with his dad when he doesn't like him very much. Irving insists that he has to go with him, and then he farts. They get into a gassy contest, which ends when Irving pushes too hard and sharts against a wall. They proceed to leave and later play some basketball while Billy asks Irving if he can take him fishing.On another misadventure, Billy gets hungry yet again and Irving takes him to a church where a wedding reception is taking place. During a group photo, Irving swipes a glass of champagne, causing the whole tower of glasses to collapse, and he ends up falling on top of the table, spilling the cake on the floor. Billy seizes the opportunity to eat some of the cake.Irving eventually drives Billy to a bar where they are meeting Chuck. Chuck is talking to a member of a biker organization called Guardians of Children, who help abused kids. Chuck explains that Billy will allow for him to get child support just as Irving and Billy walk in the door. Irving asks Chuck to make sure that Billy is well taken care of, though he rudely responds to Irving that he'll get the job done. Irving bids Billy farewell and they say they love each other, just as the GOC members watch the scene. As Irving leaves tearfully, one GOC member comes out to assure him that they'll keep their eyes on Billy. Irving drives away, but quickly starts to miss Billy and reminisces about their time on the road. He proceeds to turn the car around and drive back to the bar to get Billy back, just as Chuck is showing off his bad parenting by denying Billy any food in the place. Irving calls Billy to him, but Chuck prepares to fight the old man. The GOC members pull the two away from each other and allow Irving to leave with Billy while they hold Chuck off and warn him there will be trouble if he acts threateningly.To celebrate their reunion, Irving and Billy crash a child beauty pageant after spotting a flyer for it on their road trip earlier. Billy gets dressed up as a girl and charms most of the judges, even though one reigning child champion and her mother note the unusual event of a girl being there with a grandpa. Billy dresses up as a sailor girl to put on a show while ""My Bunny Lies Over The Ocean"" plays. It appears cute until Billy rips off the outfit to reveal him wearing women's underwear and then put on a risque pole dance to ""Cherry Pie"". The other parents and girls are stunned, and Irving tops it off by walking onstage and throwing Billy dollar bills. His wig falls off and the two run out.Irving drives up to a bridge where he and Billy finally get rid of Ellie's body by throwing it into the river.

Pacific Rim,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse. When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.—Del Torro For years, Earth is repeatedly attacked by giant monsters called Kaiju that emerge from a portal beneath the Pacific Ocean. The only effective defense is the Jaeger program, massive complex robots that require pairs of neural-linked pilots. However, as each Kaiju attack becomes more powerful and frequent, Humanity must change its tactics. To that end, former Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket is reactivated as part of a desperate plan to destroy the portal. As Raleigh strives to heal his inner scars and help his new partner conquer hers, an intrepid scientist discovers a way to link to the Kaiju's mind to learn about them. Unfortunately, that proves a mixed blessing as vital information of both sides is inadvertently shared and the stakes rise for a final battle.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) When giant lizard like creatures come out of the ocean and attack every city killing millions, all the nations come together and build giant robots called Jaegers. They are piloted by two individuals who are linked up to them mentally. While they are able to defeat the creatures whom they call Kaijus, eventually they adapt and even the Jaegers can't stop them. So all the heads of the nations decide to stop the program and to try other tactics. But Pentecost the man in charge of the Jaeger program decide to continue the program. He recruits Raleigh Becket a former Jaeger pilot who left after his co-pilot who's also his brother died. He tries to find a compatible co-pilot and when he finds no one, he gives Pentecost's assistant, a girl named Mako a chance. And when she proves to be the best, he wants her but Pentecost doesn't think she's ready. And when they try to hook up with their Jaeger, he sees what she's been through, which is what Pentecost was worried about. In the meantime, one of the scientists working on how to defeat the Kaijus thinks he found a way but he needs an actual Kaiju brain so Pentecost sends him to see a man who uses Kaiju remains to make a profit, so that he could get a Kaiju brain.—rcs0411@yahoo.com When Earth is invaded deep beneath the Pacific Ocean from a portal between dimensions in a breach by creatures called Kaijus, the governments join forces and realize that only monsters could destroy the Kaijus. The mankind builds the ultimate machines known as Jaegers, huge robots neurally controlled by two compatible pilots that have their minds interlocked. Years after, Kaijus become more powerful and a scientist discovers that they are part of an alien plan to destroy mankind first and exhaust the planet after. The former pilot Raleigh Becket, who lost his older brother Yancy Becket in a battle against a Kaiju, is summoned by Marshall Stacker Pentecost to fight again together with the rookie Mako Mori in the last hope of mankind.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film begins in 2013. Deep beneath the Pacific Ocean, a fissure opens up that leads to another dimension. Through the fissure a giant monster appears, and destroys portions of San Francisco. After several days and countless lives lost, the creature is defeated by human military forces.However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The world unites to stop the invaders, and develop the Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures. Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in the ""Drift"", synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tide, and take down the creatures which are named ""Kaiju"". Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen as a black-market commodity, their parts sold off for various collections and medicinal purposes, though many of their bodily fluids are toxic and cause severe environmental pollution. But just as the war seems to be turning in humanity's favor, the Kaiju's attacks become more frequent and more brutal.In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened, one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), and his older brother, Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) have become heroes with an impeccable record of defeating Kaijus. Pilots of the Jaeger named ""Gipsy Danger,"" they are sent off to stop a category 3 Kaiju heading towards Anchorage. The beast is larger and more powerful than previous category 3s and will be a challenge for the team. Though the information on their monitors shows a fishing boat in the path of the attack, the Becketts are told their priority is to protect Anchorage.Disobeying orders, the two still save the fishing boat, but end up being brutally attacked by the Kaiju, which possesses a head designed specifically to penetrate the Danger's chest. In the battle, the kaiju rips off the Gipsy Danger's left arm, and tears away a chunk of the vehicle's helmet, sending Yancy to his death. Raleigh barely manages to pilot Gipsy Danger on his own and finishes the battle, using the robot's giant plasma blaster to kill the creature. Raleigh later pilots the Jaeger to a remote beach where it finally collapses. Raleigh walks out, bearing injuries from the battle -- because of the Drift, Jaeger pilots experience the same injuries that their mechanical counterparts do -- and collapses on the beach too, exhausted and emotionally devastated from his brother's death.After the attack, Raleigh leaves the Jaeger Program, and goes to find work wherever he can. Five years later, he finds work along the Western coast of the United States as a construction worker, helping build a giant coastal wall that is meant to keep the Kaiju out out.In the 5 years since Raleigh was with the Jaeger program, numerous countries have called for the program to be terminated due to spiraling casualties of Jaeger pilots in the increased Kaiju attacks and the enormous cost of keeping it funded. Many assume that building the coastal barriers will make them safe, but the head of the program, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), claims that the world's leaders are making a terrible mistake. Even though Pentecost claims the program is still viable, it is relocated to Hong Kong and given 8 months of funding before the program will be permanently retired.Working on the wall near Sitka, Alaska, Raleigh sees television reports that a Kaiju has broken through the wall surrounding Sydney Harbor in Australia. Fortunately, a Jaeger named Striker Eureka was still stationed in the area before being moved to Hong Kong and is able to take the monster down. After seeing the news report, Raleigh is surprised when a helicopter lands near his construction area, with Pentecost requesting he come along. Raleigh is reluctant to join the Jaeger program again, however, Pentecost convinces him that he belongs in the pilot's seat.Raleigh is then flown to the Hong Kong Base (known as 'The Shatterdome'), where he meets Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Mako tells Raleigh that she has studied his moves during his years in action as a Jaeger pilot, Raleigh notes she seems apprehensive.Pentecost also introduces Raleigh to two scientists under their command. One of them, Dr Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day), is an obsessive 'Kaiju Fanboy,' who studies the creatures from a biological standpoint, through salvaged organs and other parts. The other is Dr Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), who is a more 'practical' man, using his mathematical knowledge to try and pinpoint the frequency of creatures coming through the ocean rift.Within the Shatterdome, the last remaining Jaegers and their crews have been assembled: The 3-pilot Crimson Typhoon (from China), Cherno Alpha (from Russia), Striker Eureka (fresh from its stint in Australia), and (to Raleigh's surprise) Gipsy Danger. However, since her encounter 5 years ago, she has been rebuilt and retrofitted for more extreme combat.Raleigh questions Pentecost on just what their plan is. Pentecost explains that are formulating a plan to drop a nuclear weapon into the channel between dimensions. If it works, the channel will be destroyed, stopping any further Kaiju from coming through. Though the plan of attacking the channel has failed in the past, the program's leaders are confident they will be successful this time if all the remaining Jaegers attack simultaneously.Pentecost soon after meets again with Geiszler and Gottlieb. Gottlieb predicts that mathematically, the number of Kaiju coming up through the rift is increasing. Geiszler meanwhile, wonders if they can learn more about the Kaiju, if they are able to 'drift' with its brain. Having a portion of one, he is eager to test his theory, but is denied by Pentecost, who decides to follow Gottlieb's research.Without his brother, Raleigh is tasked with helping to find a replacement. However, during a training and reflex exercise, Raleigh becomes irritated when Mako keeps calling him out regarding the number of moves to take down his opponent. Inquiring why she is being so vocal, she responds that he could have taken down his opponents with a shorter amount of moves. After winning approval from Pentecost, Raleigh spars with her and is amazed at her prowess. He proclaims that she should help him co-pilot Gipsy Danger, but Pentecost refuses.Eventually, another pilot is chosen for Raleigh, but at the last minute, Mako is given permission. A test-run of Gipsy Danger within the Shatterdome appears to be going well, until during the Drift session, Mako gets locked into a tragic memory and almost sets off the Jaeger's plasma cannon within the dome.Following the incident, Raleigh understands more about Mako and Pentecost. When Mako was a child, she lost her family to a Kaiju attack in Tokyo. Just when it seemed the creature was going to kill her, a Jaeger was deployed that stopped it. The pilot of the Jaeger was Pentecost himself. Even with her becoming unfocused in the drift, Raleigh still wants Mako as his partner, but is again rebuffed by Pentecost.Meanwhile, Dr Geiszler has hooked up a crude connection machine, and hooks into the Kaiju brain in his lab. The strain of the drift is quite overwhelming for Geiszler and Gottlieb shuts it down. Geiszler reports to Pentecost and his men that the link allowed him a glimpse into the other side of the portal. Geiszler had theorized that based on some Kaiju samples, that what they were seeing coming through were cloned creatures, and his drift vision appears to corroborate the theory. Unfortunately, the Kaiju brain has been damaged, and Geiszler needs a fresher brain in order to learn more. Pentecost gives him a small card, and sends him to Hong Kong to look for a man named Hannibal Chau.Geiszler finds Chau, who is actually an American going under an alias. Chau is a dealer in Kaiju remains, collecting them from battle sites and dealing them on the black market. Geiszler is sufficiently impressed with Chau's secret room containing live specimens that could be useful in his research. Geiszler tells Chau that he wants an intact brain. Chau balks at the idea since recovering a Kaiju brain is nearly impossible -- the skull bone of a Kaiju is too thick to penetrate quickly and the brains become useless when contaminated with ammonia. Geiszler still bats around Chau's arrogance and questioning demeanor, saying that he can use a Kaiju's secondary brain instead. He mentions how he drifted with a Kaiju brain, leading Chau to question that if he connected to the other side, what's to say those on the other side don't know what he now knows? Chau reveals that he'd also drifted with a Kaiju brain and the result was permanent injury to his left eye and the danger that the aliens can send any Kaiju to find him in the city.Shortly after their discussion, two Category 4 Kaijus surface near Hong Kong. Pentecost sends out Crimson Typhoon and the Cherno Alpha to fight the creatures, with Striker Eureka as backup to protect the City's coastline.Just as discussion had seemed to point to the Kaiju becoming more dangerous, the two that have emerged come with extra accoutrements. One possesses a pouch in its throat containing acid that melts away Cherno Alpha's armor, severely disabling it. Crimson Typhoon's crew take her into the fight, but she is soon overwhelmed by one of the Kaiju that uses a clawed tail to rip off the jaeger's head. Cherno is attacked by the larger of the two Kaiju and defeated when they're forced underwater and the monster crushes their reactor and cockpit.The father/son team piloting Striker Eureka abandon their orders to protect Hong Kong, and go at the creatures. However, the other Kaiju lets loose an EMP burst that disables Striker Eureka, and the equipment in the Shatterdome. With 2 hours until the system can be rebooted, Striker Eureka is dead in the water until Raleigh offers a solution: though the newer models of Jaeger are digital, the Gypsy Danger is analog and thus more resistant to EMP attacks.Pentecost sends out Raleigh and Mako, who end up destroying the EMP-armed Kaiju after a protracted battle, but the other one ends up heading into Hong Kong.While Chau and his associates have fled to their bunker, Dr Geiszler has been thrown out into the streets by Chau to hide in a public fallout shelter. However, when it sounds like the creature has settled directly over them, he begins to panic that Chau may have been right, and that it may be looking for him. As if to answer that the ceiling caves in, and the Kaiju attempts to reach him.Just then Gipsy Danger appears and distracts the Kaiju. The battle goes through many buildings, and Gipsy is able to freeze and shatter the creature's tail and tear out it's acid sac. However, the battle takes a turn when the creature suddenly sprouts giant wings and begins to carry the Jaeger into Earth's upper atmosphere. Utilizing a new weapon, a large chain-sword, they manage to destroy it before plummeting back to Earth, barely regaining control of the Jaeger as a team to make a safe landing.Raleigh and Mako return to the Shatterdome to cheers as the pilots of the Eureka also voice their thanks and appreciation. During the jubilation, Raleigh notes Pentecost bleeding slightly from both nostrils. In private, Pentecost explains how, in the earlier days of the Jaeger program, shielding from nuclear contaminants had not been considered and that his condition has been worsening over time.Meanwhile, Geiszler has returned to Chau and demands claim over the dead Kaiju's secondary brain. Chau's men attempt to get to it, but find it damaged and useless. However, they also discover the Kaiju is actually pregnant before their communication link with Chau goes dead. Just then, an infant Kaiju breaks through a slit in the side of its Mother, and attempts to escape before falling down, seemingly choking on it's own umbilical cord. As Chau gloats over the dead infant Kaiju, claiming he'd known it couldn't survive very long outside it's mother, the creature rears up and swallows him whole, finally dying in the street.Dr Gottlieb soon shows up in Hong Kong with Geiszler's machine, and though the first attempt almost killed him, Gottlieb volunteers to drift with the other scientist, to cooperate in learning more through the infant Kaiju's brain and handle the strain of the experience together.Plans are soon made to set up the Gipsy Danger and Striker Eureka to deliver the warhead to the undersea rift. With his father unable to pilot Striker due to a broken arm, Herc Hansen is left without a partner. Pentecost surprises everyone when he takes the role. However, the strain of piloting a Jaeger could prove fatal to Pentecost, but he volunteers anyway.As the two Jaegers near the rift, Geiszler and Gottlieb rush into the Shatterdome's control room, and explain that the plan will not work. The channel between dimensions will only allow in a Kaiju, the very reason for the previous failures to destroy the channel with other nuclear weapons: if they attempt to drop the warhead into the channel, it'll just deflect off the breach. The two Jaegers battle two Category 4 Kaiju guarding the rift as a third Kaiju, a Category 5, larger and more powerful than the previous creatures, emerges.Gipsy Danger and Striker Eureka sustain heavy damage in the battle. Unable to deliver the bomb, Striker Eureka detonates it to take out the defending Kaiju and give Gipsy Danger a chance to enter the rift. Once inside, Raleigh and Mako will detonate Gipsy's nuclear reactor and destroy the rift. Gipsy attaches itself to the Category 5 Kaiju and fall with it into the rift, bypassing the code that would reject any non-kaiju. Inside the Kaiju dimension, Raleigh ejects Mako in a life pod and manually initiates the detonation of the nuclear core. As Gypsy Danger enters the other dimension, Raleigh ejects in his own pod before Gipsy Danger explodes and collapses the rift, ending the Kaiju threat once and for all. On the surface of the Pacific Ocean, both pods reach the surface. For a brief period it seems that Raleigh may be dead but he awakens, much to Mako's joy.A mid-credits scene reveals that Hannibal Chau has survived being swallowed by the baby Kaiju by cutting his way out with a pocket knife. He angrily asks where the shoe he lost is."

Suddenly, the Rapture hits and the Biblical Apocalypse has begun. Now, Jay and Seth are desperately sheltering in James' house for rescue along with a few other friends. Together, they must band together to attempt to survive the end of the world, only for Jay to find that they are all too dumb and superficial to do it until they discover the only way out.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) James Francois hosting a mega house warming party in his newly built modern Los Angeles mansion.Seth Rogen, an invitee, convinces his reluctant friendJay Baruchel, visiting from Canada and who is staying with Seth as he always does when he's in town, to go to the party with him, Jay's reluctance due to not really knowing or therefore feeling comfortable with James and his friends, and he believing James and his friends feeling the same about him. Jay's uncomfortableness at the party is overtaken when he and Seth witness something otherworldly. James and the other party guests believe what happened was a mere earthquake - a common enough occurrence in southern California - which Jay is willing to admit is not what this event was despite appearing even more of an outsider to the group, that is until a more apocalyptic event hits the area around the house leading to mass fatalities, with the survivors surmising that what is happening is in the realm of a zombie apocalypse or the actual rapture itself. A few of the survivors take refuge in James' house which may or may not protect them from what is happening in the outside world. As they try to survive, the issue of self-preservation may kick in, especially as it applies to food and water, and whether to provide refuge to anyone else on the outside trying to get in. But as inner thoughts of possibly not surviving what is happening may come to front of mind, true thoughts of what this small group of celebrities think about each other may also come to light.—Huggo Instead of spending some quality time with his best friend,Seth Rogen, the actor and stand-up comedian,Jay Baruchel, finds himself dragged along toJames Franco's huge house-warming party in his new Hollywood mansion. But, as Jay tries to mingle with other celebrities, includingMichael Cera,Danny McBride,Jonah Hill, andCraig Robinson, a series of Apocalyptic events hammer Los Angeles, and the Rapture arrives in the middle of the gathering. Now, holed up in James' minimalist house, a handful of survivors must make do with the rapidly decreasing food and water supplies, and figure out a way to stay alive. Can they outsmart Judgment Day?—Nick Riganas Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles to visit old friend and fellow Canadian actor Seth Rogen, who invites him to a housewarming party hosted by James Franco. There, Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded party (Rihanna hits Michael Cera for slapping her bum. Mindy wants to have sex with Cera. Emma Stone is a snob), so Seth accompanies him to a convenience store where beams of blue light suddenly come down and suck numerous people into the sky, prompting Seth and Jay to flee back to James' house finding the party unharmed. Jay tries to tell how he saw people got sucked off into the sky, but nobody believes him, including Seth (as Seth was trapped under a steel cart at that time in the store)An earthquake then strikes and the crowd rushes outside, witnessing the Hollywood Hills engulfed in flames. Michael Cera, who is high off cocaine, gets impaled by a street light when a sinkhole opens up swallowing himself, Rihanna, Mindy Kaling, Jason Segel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Martin Starr. Jonah Hill bumps into Jay dropping him into the hole but is able to hold on to a ledge while Jonah runs back into the house.James' assistant Karen is accidentally crushed by Paul Rudd (who arrived late at the party). Aziz Ansari who was hanging from a ledge grabs Kevin Hart's leg to try and get him to pull him up but Aziz gets his arm cut off and falls into the hole. Kevin also falls into the hole while trying to get Aziz's arm off his leg. Jay attempts pull up David Krumholtz but gets dropped into the hole. Jay survives and makes it back inside the house where Seth, James, Jonah, and Craig Robinson are attempting to process what just happened. Jay tells them that the earthquake has destroyed most of Los Angeles. They then take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, board up the house and await help (they believe that in an emergency the actors are rescued first).
At night Seth tells Jay that if there was a blue light sucking people into the sky (Jay says its the biblical judgment day), that means that they were not good enough to go to heaven.The next morning, Danny McBride, who crashed the party and fell asleep, wakes up first and wastes most of the group's food and water due to his ignorance of the crisis. He disbelieves what the others tell him of the previous night's events until a man outside is decapitated by an unseen creature. The head falls inside the house, leading to some frantic kicking of the severed head, spewing blood all over the house.
Tensions rise due to various conflicts, including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the Apocalypse predicted in the Book of Revelation. Emma Watson makes her way back to James' house (she says she hid in a drainpipe for 2-3 days and she believes that its a zombie invasion as she was hearing growling noises), but due to a misunderstanding (Emma goes to sleep, while Jay talks to the group about making her comfortable in a house with 6 guys by not giving sexual assault vibes. The discussion turns to who has the most sexual assault types vibes, which Emma overhears and thinks the guys are making a plan to sexually assault her), she believes the group is planning to sexually assault her and leaves with the group's remaining water.Craig Robinson goes for water stored in James' cellar, but he encounters an unknown being, causing him to believe Jay's theory.

Before leaving, Danny (tries to shoot everybody with James's gun, only to find that it was filled with blanks) reveals that Jay was in town two months prior, but stayed at a hotel instead of with Seth because of their strained friendship.
That night, Jonah prays for Jay to die and is possessed by a demon. Jay and Craig go to a neighbors house to get some supplies. They find food, and Jay suggests that they do not return. But Jay changes his mind when they are attacked by demons inside the neighbors house.

He finds the boy hiding in a room and safely gets him out just as more goons come in firing at them. Mike assures Connor that his father is going to be okay, and he gets him up a ventilation shaft to get out safely. Connor is rescued by some troops as Mike takes down other goons. He interrogates them, and they laugh in his face. He responds by stabbing one of them in the throat until he gets an answer. He lets Jacobs know Kang's name and to learn something about him.Kang learns about Mike's presence from Forbes, and so he is sent to get rid of him. Forbes comes across Mike, who is still unaware of his deception. When he accidentally slips Kang's name, Mike realizes the truth and the two get into a fight. Forbes tries to stab him, but Mike gets the knife from him and stabs him. As he lies dying, Mike asks him why he did this. Forbes reveals it was because he lost his son. Mike has him tell Kang that he got Mike, which he does before Mike fatally stabs him in the throat.Kang attempts to get another code from McMillan, who is utterly defiant. Kang starts to brutally assault her, but she still won't give up the code. When she is nearly beaten to death, Asher orders her to give up her code, which she does. The second Cerberus code is activated, and the Pentagon becomes aware of this. They also learn that Kang is a well-known terrorist who lost his mother to an American landmine and is very much infamous.Mike manages to get through to Kang's security and taunts him. He lets Kang know that Connor is safe and that he is going to put his knife through his brain. Asher listens to all of this.Several troops start flying into Washington to retaliate. Mike informs General Clegg that the terrorists possess Hydra Six - more powerful weapons than what the Americans have. Regardless, Clegg has the troops come in, but the terrorists shoot down one helicopter that crashes into the White House and causes a big explosion that severely damages the building.Kang gets through to the Pentagon, and executes Vice President Rodriguez. He orders them to finally recall the Seventh Fleet and to have a helicopter filled up and ready to get them out of there by dawn. He pulls McMillan out and takes her outside.As the news media are getting coverage of the situation, they inform viewers of South Korea's response to the situation, as well as getting footage of McMillan slowly stepping out into plain sight. With her back turned, Kang nearly shoots her, but Mike gets there first and opens fire, distracting Kang and allowing McMillan to run out and be rescued by troops.Kang makes it back to the bunker and has several hostages, including Asher, with a bag over their heads, along with the terrorists, just as their requested helicopter is coming down. The Seventh Fleet is called out from Korea as well.The hostages and terrorists get into the helicopter just as troops are locked on them. They are unable to fire, fearing they will hit the President. Just as the helicopter takes off, it explodes in mid-air and crashes to the ground. The Pentagon panics and they fear the worst - that Asher was killed in the explosion with everybody else. Mike is informed, but he knows that it doesn't add up, since Kang would not try and go out that way.Sure enough, it was a diversion. Kang and the other remaining terrorists are holding Asher in the bunker and get the final Cerberus code out of him. Kang's true plan is revealed - he plans to detonate ALL of the nuclear weapons to completely obliterate the United States.Mike is heading back down, but Clegg orders him to stand down. However, Clegg is put in his place by Trumbull, and Mike proceeds down to the bunker. Just as the terrorists are getting out, Mike shoots some of them. Asher knocks two of them down and struggles in a fight with Kang. He gets shot in the side as Mike attacks Kang. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat, with Kang nearly overpowering him. Kang taunts Mike and tells him he's failed again, but Mike gets the upper hand and takes Kang down. True to his word, he grabs his knife and sticks it in Kang's head, killing him.Mike rushes into the bunker and informs the Pentagon that Asher is alive, but he needs to stop the detonation sequence as there is barely a minute left. Jacobs, Trumbull, and Clegg rush to give Mike the deactivation code, and, with seconds to spare, Mike successfully shuts down the detonation sequence, much to the relief of everybody else. Mike takes Asher outside, where he is reunited with Connor, and Mike is reunited with Leah.Asher delivers a speech to the nation, commemorating those who were killed in the terrorist attack, but assures them that the attack gave them the hope and confidence to stand up and rise from fear to defend themselves. As he concludes, he walks off the stage and shakes Mike's hand. Mike stands proudly, knowing he has finally redeemed himself."

A man takes on a mission that could bring equality to the polarized worlds. In the year 2154, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. Secretary Delacourt, a government official, will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve the luxurious lifestyle of the citizens of Elysium. That doesn't stop the people of Earth from trying to get in by any means they can. When unlucky Max is backed into a corner, he agrees to take on a daunting mission that, if successful, will not only save his life but could bring equality to these polarized worlds.—Production In 2154, the population is divided in two social classes: the wealthy people live in Elysium, a space station with all the resources; the poor people live on the exhausted Earth. In Los Angeles, the former car thief Max da Costa is on parole and works in an unhealthy factory Armadyne managed by the CEO John Carlyle. He dreams of saving money to travel to Elysium. Meanwhile the Secretary of Defense of Elysium, Delacourt, plots a coup d'etat against President Patel, with the support of Carlyle. He programs a software that can override Elysium's data system and make any change, including the president's name to Delacourt. Carlyle uploads the software to his brain to increase its protection. Max is exposed to a lethal amount of radiation in Armadyne and has only five more days of life. He seeks out the criminal Spider expecting to travel to Elysium, where he can use a medical chamber called Med-bay that is capable to heal any disease and save his life. Spider tells that if Max steals profitable information, such as bank accounts, from the brain of Carlyle that is on Earth. Max accepts the proposal without knowing the powerful knowledge in Carlyle's brain. When Delacourt learns that the information she needs to become president was stolen from Carlyle brain, she sends the notorious agent Kruger to hunt down Max and recover the software at any cost.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the future Earth is over populated and so polluted that the wealthy and powerful create a new place to live. It's called Elysium and it's just within Earth's orbit. and they have all sorts of conveniences among them is a machine can heal anyone. So people on Earth who want to use it try to get there.

Her latest attempt to keep people off Alysium catches the ire of the President who tells her to tone down her attitude and to stop using men like Kruger. Delacourt then approaches Carlyle, the head of Armadyne Corp, the company that built Elysium and all of what they use up there and asks him to make a program that would allow her to remove the President and put someone else in his position. He agrees to do it. On Earth, Max a man who has dreamed of going to Elysium and taking Frey, a girl he grew up with there. Max works for Armadyne and while at work Max is exposed to radiation and has days to live and needs to go to Elysium to use the machine.

Max agrees and is fitted with an exo-skeleton to help him. They intercept Carlyle as he was leaving for Elysium to deliver the program to Delacout and get the information out of him. Delacourt would send Kruger to save Carlyle but is killed in the crossfire. Delacourt tells Kruger to get Max because he has the program in his head. And Kruger decides to get Max through Frey. When Spider sees the program he tells Max this could change the whole system but Max wants to help Frey first.—rcs0411@yahoo.com The year is 2154, and the division between social classes has grown wider than ever before. As the rich enjoy a life of luxury and access to cutting-edge medical technology on Elysium, the rest of the human race contend with poverty, crime, and disease on the surface of planet Earth. Meanwhile, hard-line immigration laws ensure that only those who have been explicitly approved will ever set foot on the elusive paradise in the stars. 36-year-old Max (Matt Damon) lives in an L.A. shantytown and earns his living by working on an Armadyne assembly line. He's had a rough past, but he's struggling to stay on the right side of the law when he realizes that his only hope for survival after being exposed to deadly radiation is to reach Elysium. Should Max succeed, he will strike a major blow for equality in the eyes of his fellow surface dwellers; should he fail, it will mean certain death. In his quest to become the hero who can restore the balance between the rich and the poor, however, Max must first do battle with Elysium's hawkish Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster), who has devoted her entire career to maintaining that division, and whose key enforcer Kruger (Sharlto Copley) is notorious for his brutal tactics in driving out illegals. With the fates of millions hanging in the balance, Max sets his sights on Elysium and never looks back.. In the year 2154, the Earth is polluted, vastly overpopulated, the climate has become hot and dry and disease runs rampant through the dilapidated slums that the cities have become. The wealthiest people have fled the planet and taken refuge on Elysium, a Stanford Torus high-tech space station, just beyond earth's atmosphere.While those on Earth are policed by ruthless robots, Elysium's citizens are governed by President Patel (Faran Tahir), in a Utopian setting which includes access to private medical machines, called ""Med-Bays,"" that offer instant cures for virtually any ailment or injury a person may experience.A young boy named Max DeCosta (Perry Cotton) and his young girlfriend, Frey Santiago (Valentina Giros), are living in the ruins of Los Angeles, where the surrounding area is now a vast desert and people live in nothing more than small shacks. Frey can read and she reads Max stories about Elysium. Max lives in an orphanage with a kindly nun. The nun says he is born to do something great.Frey and Max are looking up at Elysium, which is visible from Earth. Max intends to go there someday and promises to take Frey with him. Frey takes a pen and marks on Max's hand. She inscribes a circle and the letters M + F.Years later, when he's 36 years old, Max (Matt Damon), sports numerous tattoos and wears an electronic ankle bracelet. He is preparing to board a bus to travel to his job. Two security robots approach him as he's standing in line. When asked what he's carrying in his pack, Max answers with a sarcastic tone. They rip off his backpack, then hit him twice, breaking his wrist. He's a felon, a former car thief, and on parole, so he's frequently singled out for harassment. Max, identified as #6722, and Frey, now a nurse, accidentally meet at the clinic where he goes to have his arm treated. Max asks her to have coffee with him, but she declines. Finally, she agrees to meet him soon.Max had been ordered by the robots to go see his parole officer, another robot. The parole officer robot can detect ""attitude"" and it doesn't like Max's, so his parole is extended. The robot then offers Max a pill to help calm his heart rate, which it has detected as elevated. Max smirks and turns it down.Max works at an assembly line for Armadyne Corp, a company which supplies Elysian weaponry, as well as the robots which police the Earth. The shift supervisor docks him half a day's pay for being late.Partaking of an illegal emigration operation, some of the people in Los Angeles were able to come up with some money which they use to acquire Elysium identification brands on their wrists, then they board three dilapidated looking shuttles, which take off and fly towards Elysium. The shuttles require codes, which were also stolen.A French-speaking woman named Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is the Defence Secretary for Elysium. When she's told about three unauthorized shuttles approaching, she overrides Executive Order 355 and activates a rogue sleeper agent on Earth named C.M. Kruger (Sharlto Copley). Kruger immediately grabs a shoulder-fired ground to air missile launcher and fires off four rockets. The rockets chase down the shuttles and destroy two of them, killing all 46 people on board. The other shuttle makes it to Elysium and lands. The rich folks in the area are all in a tizzy, as helicopters and robots give chase of the occupants of the shuttle.One mother and her daughter who were on the shuttle that landed rush into a house and find a Med-Bed. The girl's wrist is scanned, and she is identified as an Elysium citizen. A machine then assesses her physical condition, determining she had multiple fractures, and begins repairing the broken bones.The incident results in 32 arrests and 13 casualties, with two at-large. The at large were the mother and daughter, who are soon apprehended. All 34 are prepared for deportation back to earth.Max's friend Julio (Diego Luna), tries to entice him to come back into the auto theft game, but he refuses, wanting to complete his parole and find a way to get up to Elysium.At Max's workstation, a pallet jams the door to the firing unit for the robots. The supervisor orders Max to clear the door or he will lose his job. Max has no choice but to squeeze into the chamber and push the pallet away from the door. When he does, the door slams shut and the unit powers on, giving Max a lethal dose of radiation. After he is finally dragged from the chamber and sent to a medical unit, he is told by another droid that he will die in five days of organ failure. Armadyne CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner) goes down on the production floor to see what the emergency was. He sees Max lying on a bed in the infirmary and orders that Max be taken away, so he won't mess up the bedding. A robot gives Max some pills to help him deal with the inevitable discomfort and will keep him physically functional until he dies.President Patel summons Delacourt. She is brought before the President and his cabinet. They are not happy with her for ordering the shuttles shot down, and for using Kruger to do it. Delacourt is impudent, as she sasses Patel and all but calls him a coward who would see Elysium destroyed if not for people like her. Patel threatens to fire Delacourt if she screws up again. He orders her to stop using Kruger. When Kruger learns that he's not going to be utilized anymore, he becomes infuriated and feels betrayed.Julio sees Max returning from the infirmary, barely able to walk, and rushes to help him. Julio helps him take some of the pills. Max tells Julio that he wants to go see Spider (Wagner Moura), the rebel behind the illegal transports to Elysium, about getting to Elysium. Max is desperate to make the trip now, as he needs a Med-Bay to heal himself.Frey has a young daughter, Matilda (Emma Tremblay), who experiences seizures. She had been taking her to work with her, but was ordered to leave her daughter home, as the doctors weren't able to give her treatments.Max and Julio got to the high-tech rebel command centre where Max asks Spider for an identification brand and a ticket to Elysium, promising to come back and work for him. He reminds Spider that he did three years in prison for him. Spider decides to make Max an offer. If he'll plug into the brain of one of Elysium's high-ranking officials and obtain pass codes and other secret data that would provide Spider access to money, then he'd make sure Max was able to get to Elysium.Max must submit to surgery by what appear to be nothing more than glorified tattoo artists. They attach a third-generation powered exoskeleton to Max's body and wire a data collection device to his brain. The exoskeleton gives Max the strength of a droid. Max tells Spider that his friend, Julio, had to be included in the deal, and that John Carlyle must be the high-level target.Delacourt, vowing to protect Elysium and her own power, bargains with Carlyle to create a program that can override Elysium's computer core to give her the Presidency. Carlyle would be beneficiary of a 200 year contract to provide essential services to the community of Elysium. Carlyle works up a new computer protocol called ""Sabre Cerebral Defence,"" and programs it into his own brain device. He also encrypts it with a denial system that would prove lethal to anyone attempting to download and use the program. He then boards a shuttle for a flight to Elysium.Max, Julio (Diego Luna) and a team of Spider's men arm themselves and make use of two fast armoured vehicles. They are aware of Carlyle's planned flight to Elysium and they set out to intercept him. Max shoots an explosive device at the shuttle, which locks on near one of the engines. As there is only 15 seconds until the shuttle goes supersonic, the explosive device must be detonated in short order. Once the shuttle has cleared its launch facility and has travelled a short distance, the explosive is detonated, and the shuttle is forced to crash land.Delacourt calls Kruger as soon as she's informed that Carlyle's shuttle has gone down, and that a former felon named Max De Costa was responsible. Kruger demands that he be ""reinstated"" if he decides to go rescue Carlyle. Delacourt allows it, then arranges for two of Kruger's former associates to pick him up.Max and his men arrive at Carlyle's shuttle and are confronted by one of two droids who were on the shuttle with Carlyle. After a difficult fight, Max destroys one droid. One of the men then uses a device to cut through the hull of Carlyle's shuttle and provide access to him. However, the second droid exits on the opposite side and comes around to confront Max and the others. Max and the others exchange fire with the droid. One of the men is firing his weapon while keeping his body hidden, so he can't see where his rounds are going. Max warns him not to hit Carlyle, who is shot in the chest. Max then engages the droid in hand-to-hand battle, finally tearing it's head off.Max and his men quickly establish a head-to-head computer connection between Max and the quickly dying Carlyle, but something is wrong and Max's computer expert says he can't read the data being transferred. They are out of time, as Kruger and his cohorts have arrived. When Max tries to run, he collapses, and Julio has to pause to help him -- something about the downloaded data is causing him head pain. Kruger's weapons on the shuttle he's in are very effective. He shoots and flips over one of the vehicles Max and his men had been using.Kruger lands his shuttle and gets out and attacks Max, stabbing him. Kruger is about to decapitate Max when Julio shoots Kruger in the neck. Kruger mercilessly runs his sword through Julio. Max recovers and shoots at Kruger, but Kruger uses a force field to avoid being killed. On Elysium, Delacourt orders that Max be captured but that his brain be left undamaged.Carlyle dies and Max is able to escape. As he stumbles along, with Kruger and his men in pursuit in the shuttle with sophisticated tracking equipment, an old lady hides Max under her cart filled with pigs, thus helping him evade detection. Kruger deploys six tracking discs that start flying around the city attempting to locate Max. Delacourt issues a ""No Fly"" order for all craft in the Los Angeles area, so that Kruger can search unimpeded. Kruger now knows what the data transfer between Carlyle and Max was all about.Max goes to see Frey, calling out to her on the street as she was leaving her job. He begs her for help, telling her she couldn't tell anyone. She takes him to her home where she has the necessary medical supplies to help him. As she's tending to his stab wound, she notices a tattoo he has, a circle and the letters M + F, the same thing she once wrote on his hand with an ink pen when they were children. Max is saved by Frey and he meets Matilda. Frey tells Max that Matilda has leukaemia. She asks Max to find a way to get Matilda to Elysium, so she can be cured. Max tells her it's too dangerous, and he can't do it. Matilda tells Max a story about a meerkat who is hungry, so he befriends a lonely hippo in order to get some fruit. The point of the story was to indicate how creatures in need can find ways to help one another. Max just says he's sorry and then he leaves.One of the search discs finds Max once he's back out on the streets. Max throws a rock at it and knocks it out of the sky, but not before Kruger has seen Max. Kruger and his men quickly travel to Frey's place and bust in, demanding to know where Max is. They take Frey and Matilda with them in the shuttle.Max goes to see Spider and demands he fly him to Elysium immediately. Spider tells Max that there's a no-fly order in effect and it can't be done. Spider then connects to the port in Max's head to see what data had transferred from Carlyle's head. He quickly realizes it's a reboot program for Elysium, something of tremendous significance. Max realizes he can trade the data for his cure and decides to leave. Spider has to quickly order his men not to shoot Max. Max is desperate to get to Elysium so he can heal his radiation poisoning.Max returns to the site of the disc he'd knocked out of the sky and he looks into its camera and tells Kruger to come get him. When Kruger arrives, Max produces a grenade and pulls the pin, telling Kruger that if he doesn't take him to Elysium, he will blow his own head off and destroy the reboot program. Kruger invites Max on board the shuttle, where Max is surprised to see Frey and Matilda. They start the 19 minute trip to Elysium.Delacourt lifts the no-fly restriction on L.A. Spider knows that Max is on a shuttle and bound for Elysium, as he'd attached a tracking device to Max before he'd taken off. Spider and two of his men get on their own shuttle and take off for Elysium.Kruger sings softly to Matilda and kisses Frey on the forehead. He's feeling an attraction for Frey and is willing to help Matilda as a result. When one of Kruger's associates approaches Frey, Max tells the guy to back up. Kruger then lunges and grabs at the grenade in Max's hand. They struggle. Max and Kruger fall, and the grenade rolls free. It blows up and destroys half of Kruger's face. The shuttle also becomes uncontrollable and crash lands on Elysium.Max carries Matilda to a safe spot away from the shuttle, then opens the shuttle doors and goes back for Frey, who was trapped in her seat. He frees her and she goes and gets Matilda and carries her into a mansion as Elysium security forces are arriving. Max, meanwhile, has to fight with one of the bad guys on the shuttle. The second bad guy takes off after the girls. Frey places Matilda in a healing bed inside the mansion, but because Matilda isn't recognized as a legitimate citizen, the bed won't work. Kruger's goon arrives and tasers Frey. Max ends up getting tasered as well.Delacourt, who has told President Patel that because the intruders have committed an act of war and that she was now in charge, wants the data extracted from Max's head, which her expert tells her will kill Max. She's fine with that.Spider arrives in his clanky old shuttle, managing to land without incident. He immediately heads for where his tracking device indicates Max is.Kruger's goons take Frey and Matilda away. They put Kruger in a machine which completely reconstructs his face and head in about 30 seconds. He then wakes up. He survived only because his brain had not been damaged by the grenade explosion.Max breaks loose from his bonds and disables the two lab techs who'd been working on him. He forces one of them to tell him where Frey and Matilda had been taken.Delacourt approaches Kruger, who's still feeling out of sorts and very much on edge. When she starts criticizing him for stupidly crashing the shuttle in a suburban area, he angrily smashes the mirror he'd been examining his face in. He picks up a fairly large piece and jams it into Delacourt's throat. She goes down, bleeding badly.Kruger makes it clear that he intends to use the data deposited in Max's head to re-program Elysium and make himself the new president. Kruger tosses Delacourt into the room with Frey and Matilda. Kruger tells Frey that he was going to make sure her daughter is never healed. Kruger's goons start roaming around tossing grenades to take out Elysium's command and control structure. Matilda starts treating Delacourt's wound, but Delacourt stops her, preferring instead to die. Max calls Spider and they make their immediate plans. Max then heads for the armoury and takes the last of his pain pills.Kruger is now outfitted in a military-grade exoskeleton far superior to Max's droid suit, then orders his goon to kill Frey and Matilda. The goon plans to have some fun with Frey first, but Max gets there first and he is of superhuman strength after taking those pills and he simply crushes the goon, slamming him against the floor. The second goon comes in shooting and Max grabs an automatic weapon and kills him.Max sends Frey to the surface with Matilda, telling Frey to get Matilda to a Med Bay, promising her that it will work this time. Max teams up with Spider, reminding Spider that they have a deal only if Frey gets her daughter to a Med Bay. Spider sends one of his men to help Frey.Kruger blows up one of Spider's men. Some high frequency sounds are broadcast, which disables Max, as he can't bear them. Kruger then goes after Max with his sword. In a desperate fight on a high catwalk, Spider tackles Kruger before he can stab Max and Kruger's sword goes flying several levels below. Kruger then jams a knife into Spider's hand, taking him out of the fight.Max and Kruger engage in hand-to-hand combat. Max is losing the fight, when he suddenly executes a body flip and disengages Kruger's exoskeleton power source on the way down. Kruger manages to clip Max to a railing and then pulls the pin on a grenade, intending to blow them both up. Max pulls himself loose and flips both Kruger and the grenade over the railing. Kruger explodes in mid-air.Spider makes a cable connection to the port in Max's head at the same instant that Frey flips the switch on a Med Bay containing Matilda. Spider first confirms that Max wants him to proceed, as the data download process will be fatal to Max. Max confirms, but first he connects to Frey and tells her goodbye. Max then presses ""Enter"" on Spider's computer, just as President Patel arrives with security to arrest Spider. The Elysium reboot takes place and everyone on Earth becomes a citizen of Elysium. Max dies, Spider is released, Matilda is healed, and numerous Aid shuttles are sent to Earth to help the new citizens."

Dusty Crophopper is a little cropduster plane with a fear of heights and a crazy dream of being a racer. While his friends need convincing, Dusty gets the training he needs from Skipper, a veteran fighter, and qualifies for the Wings Across the World race. In the event, Dusty finds competitors who soon learn that there is something special about this underdog as he is tested to his physical and emotional limits. In doing so, Dusty soon finds enemies, and more importantly friends, who are inspired by his dream. In the face of all obstacles, the winner of this air race will be anyone's guess.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Cars gets a high-flying spin-off with this Disney Toon Studios film about a humble crop duster who dreams of becoming a great air racer. Dusty (voice of Dane Cook) spends most of his days flying low, but his eyes are always turned up toward the clouds. Sadly, Dusty's modest engine and intense fear of heights make a career in racing a long shot at best. Things begin to look up for Dusty, however, when a veteran aviator helps him qualify for a race against the reigning circuit champ. Now if Dusty can just learn to let go of his fears, his checkered-flag dreams may finally come true.. The big dreamer and hard-working crop-dusting plane, Dusty Crophopper, has the fervent desire to become a famous racing plane at the prestigious Wings Around the Globe annual international air race. However, to achieve such a noble aspiration, Dusty's only chance of winning lies in the experienced flaps of the battle-scarred U.S. Navy Corsair, Skipper, who, along with a group of true friends, will help him with all they've got. But, has the underdog from the farm what it takes to defeat the arrogant and unscrupulous world champion, Ripslinger?—Nick Riganas Dusty Crophopper is a cropduster plane who works at a cornfield and practices aerobatic manuveurs in his spare time, dreaming of becoming a racer. His dreams are scorned by his boss, Leadbottom and his forklift/mechanic friend, Dottie. However, he is supported by his fuel truck friend, Chug. Dusty and Chug train for qualifiers for the upcoming Wings Across the World race. On the night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly and reclusive navy war plane named Skipper Riley to teach him how to fly well but Skipper refuses. Dusty enters the qualifiers, and although the audience mocks him for being a crop duster, he manages to wow them by his well-practiced flight maneuvers, but barely makes it into the race.Later in the morning, Skipper visits Dusty and tries to talk him out of racing, but when Dusty explains he wants to prove he's more than just a crop duster, Skipper decides to mentor Dusty on his speed and agility. While in the midst of his training, Dusty admits that he has a fear of heights. Despite this, their training continues and when it is complete, Dusty heads off to the meeting of the race at John F. Kennedy Airport where he befriends a crazy but loyal Mexican race-plane named El Chupacabra who eventually falls in love with a beautiful French-Canadian racer named Rochelle, who shows little interest in him. Dusty then makes a rival of the arrogant and villainous 3-time winner plane Ripslinger, who rudely dismisses him as being only a crop duster. He also falls in love with a racer plane named Ishani, who becomes supportive of him. During the first leg of the race from New York to Iceland, Dusty's refusal to fly high causes him to finish in last place. During the second leg of the race to Germany, Dusty shows good sportsmanship by saving another racer, Bulldog from crashing when Bulldog's eyes get squirted with oil from one of his propellers, winning Bulldog's respect but finishing last again.In India, Ishani gives Dusty some advice on how to fly low through the Himalayas by following some railroad tracks. However, after encountering a tunnel and barely being able to fly through it, Dusty realizes Ishani deliberately gave him bad advice in order to get a new propeller from Ripslinger and he shuns her. As the race continues, Dusty manages to get into first place. In Shanghai, Dusty manages to help El Chupacabra win over Rochelle with a romantic song. In the next race across the Pacific Ocean, Ripslinger's henchmen, Ned and Zed, under orders from Ripslinger, sabotage Dusty's navigation antenna. Lost and low on fuel, Dusty miraculously comes across the USS ""Flysinhower"" (a reference to the real-life carrier) which allows him to land and refuel. While on the carrier, Dusty sees a hall of fame set up for Skipper's squadron, but discovers Skipper only flew one mission, which contradicts his previous reputation as a veteran of many battles. He is then forced to take off in order to try and beat an oncoming storm.Dusty gets distracted from flying due to his thoughts about Skipper and ends up crashing into the ocean but is eventually rescued. He is flown to Mexico to his friends but he is severely damaged and may never fly again. Skipper confesses to Dusty that he did indeed fly only one mission in the Pacific theatre where his entire squad of trainees was killed in an attack on the Japanese Navy. Skipper was the only survivor, but torn by his guilt, he never trained another plane or flew again. Demoralized and heartbroken, Dusty begins to consider dropping out of the race, but is encouraged by his friends, Bulldog, Ishani, and many of his newfound fans to continue and they all donate parts to have Dusty repaired.With a change of heart and morale restored, Dusty becomes determined to win the race but Ripslinger still won't give up and plots to sabotage his chances of winning.

The Lone Ranger,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210819/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Native American warrior Tonto recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid, a man of the law, into a legend of justice. In the 1930s, an elderly Tonto tells a young boy the tale of John Reid, the Lone Ranger. An idealistic lawyer, he rides with his brother and fellow Texas Rangers in pursuit of the notorious Butch Cavendish. Ambushed by the outlaw and left for dead, John Reid is rescued by the renegade Comanche, Tonto, at the insistence of a mysterious white horse and offers to help him to bring Cavendish to justice. Becoming a reluctant masked rider with a seemingly incomprehensible partner, Reid pursues the criminal against all obstacles. However, John and Tonto learn that Cavendish is only part of a far greater injustice and the pair must fight it in an adventure that would make them a legend.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In 1933, in San Francisco, a boy visits the Wild West in a sideshow and meets an elderly Tonto in a chamber and the Comanche tells the story of The Lone Ranger to him. In 1869, the idealistic prosecutor John Reid returns by train to his hometown Colby. In the same train, it is traveling the criminal Butch Cavendish that will be judged for his crimes and hanged in the town due to a request of Latham Cole, who represents the railroad company. However, Butch escapes and John rides with his brother Dan Reid and six other Texas Rangers to capture him. However, the rangers are ambushed and killed by the notorious outlaw and his gang and only John survives. He teams up with Tonto to bring Butch Cavendish to justice in a dangerous journey of discoveries.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 1933, a boy named Will who idolizes the legendary Lone Ranger encounters the elderly Comanche Tonto in a sideshow at a San Francisco fair. Tonto proceeds to recount his experiences with that Old West adventurer. In 1869, lawyer John Reid returns home to Colby, Texas, via the uncompleted Transcontinental Railroad, managed by railroad tycoon Latham Cole. Unknown to Reid, the train is also carrying Tonto and outlaw Butch Cavendish, who is being transported for his hanging after being captured by Dan Reid, John's Texas Ranger brother. Cavendish's gang rescues Butch and derails the train. Tonto is subsequently jailed. Dan deputizes John as a Texas Ranger, and with six others they go after the Cavendish gang.. In San Francisco during the 1930's, a boy, Will, makes his way through a busy carnival near the under-construction Golden Gate Bridge. The boy dressed in a costume similar to that of the Lone Ranger, walks past the carnival barkers and the concession stands to the Wild West Tent. He pays for entry, and inside, sees stuffed buffaloes, cowboy mannequins, and walks up to a wax sculpture of an old Indian. As he gets closer to the wax figure, the Indian's eyes move. The very old and mentally unstable Indian introduces himself as Tonto (Johnny Depp). The boy, Will, is a fan of the Lone Ranger and recognizes the name. The boy wonders how Tonto came to be a mannequin in a traveling circus. Tonto starts to tell him the story.Tonto sits astride a horse on a high bluff looking over the western desert. His masked partner, The Lone Ranger (Armie Hammer), gallops up along-side him. He declares that it's time, and they ride into town on their horses. They take over the town bank, order all of its occupants to put their hands in the air, and they proceed to carry out a heist. Back in 1930's San Francisco, Will can't believe what he's hearing, because the Lone Ranger was a hero, not a bank robber.To explain the circumstances that led to this episode, Tonto goes back a little bit further in time.1869 - Colby, TexasColby, Texas is a rest stop on the transcontinental railroad, where construction is underway at a rapid rate, overseen by rail magnate Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson). A train is approaching Colby. In one car, Tonto sits shackled, next to the notorious outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). Cavendish will be hanged at the next stop, and the federal Marshals are along to make certain the execution takes place. A few cars back, John Reid, the young, college-educated prosecutor, sits in a train car full of protestant missionaries who are singing church hymns. When one of the missionaries asks John if he's a God-fearing man, John responds that he is a law-fearing man. In the prisoner car, Tonto watches Butch peel a wood plank out of the train car's floor, revealing a gun hidden in a compartment beneath the plank. Butch hides the gun, and asks the Marshals if he can get up to urinate. They unchain him and lead him to a chamber pot in the corner of the car. With Butch's back turned while urinating, Tonto gestures to the lawmen that ""Butch has a gun"". The Marshals take note, but Butch shoots both of them before they can draw their weapons.At the train station, a quintet of Texas Rangers, headed-up by John's brother Dan Reid, waits for Butch. Elsewhere, Dan's wife Rebecca and son Danny are shopping in the town's commercial stalls (there is a correlation to the set up early in the movie of the Carnival midway stalls). A man named Cole happens upon the pair and flirts with Rebecca, who does not return Cole's attentions.Butch's outlaw gang catches up with the train, boards it, and robs its occupants, killing the engineers before locking the train at full speed. John, overhearing gunshots and footsteps above, gets up to investigate. He breaks into the prisoner car where he finds Tonto and Butch about to kill one another. John disarms them both, announces himself as the district attorney, and forces them to surrender. Suddenly the train car's doors slide open, revealing Butch's gang waiting for him. They chain up Tonto and John, free Butch, and take off while the train rumbles out of control past the train station at full steam. Dan and his posse saddle up and chase after the train. Tonto manages to separate his chains from the train car, and when he realizes that he and John are chained together, takes John with him to the front of the train, taking out a pair of Butch's gang members. They get to the steam engine, where they find Dan, and attempt to stop the train. All three realize that the train can't be stopped, and separate the passenger cars from the steam engine. The steam engine derails at the end of the track, nearly killing Tonto and John in the process. Unchained during the wreck, Tonto begins to walk away, only to be stopped by John, who latches himself around Tonto's leg. Dan catches them both, and Tonto is presumed to be a criminal, arrested and taken to the town jail.John and Dan must track down and arrest Butch. Dan wants to find him and kill him, but John insists that Butch must be captured alive and tried in a court of law. Dan kisses Rebecca goodbye, deputizes John, says goodbye to his son. The posse of John and the other Texas Rangers rides off in search of Butch.During the hunt, they all observe an all-white horse standing on a bluff. Dan explains that the Comanche Indians believe the white horse is a spirit animal, able to cross over from the living world to the dead one. When John asks where Dan learned about native customs, Dan reveals that he's spent the last several years working with the Comanche Indians, and has an appreciation for their culture, even wearing their jewelry.The posse loses track of Butch's trail at a small canyon, and with no other choice, gallops into it. Ranger Collins disappears and suddenly, the remaining posse is ambushed by Butch's gang. Dan's men are shot down one by one, until John and Dan are left. A bullet kills John's horse, and it collapses, landing on John's leg. Dan tries to save John but is shot multiple times. John frees himself from the horse and runs over to Dan, but is shot in the chest. John falls to the ground and he passes out. Butch and his gang reveal themselves around Dan and John's bodies. Dan, still alive, swears at Butch, who takes a knife, cuts out Dan's heart, and eats it in front of him. John, drifting in and out of consciousness, watches in horror before passing out. Butch orders them all to move out, and they escape back to their hideout.High above the canyon, Tonto, having escaped from his prison cell, sees the result of the massacre. He sneaks down to the canyon floor and gathers the seven bodies. He digs graves for each, including John, and as he goes through their pockets for valuables, John awakens. Tonto knocks John out with a rock to the head, and pretends that John is dead. As Tonto buries the other Rangers' bodies, the white horse trots over and stands over John's grave. Tonto instantly recognizes this as a sign from the great beyond that John is meant to live another day. Tonto tries to convince the horse that Dan is the warrior but concedes and takes John's body. Tonto slings John over the back of the white horse and the two men & horse head out of the canyon. As John sleeps, Tonto melts down the silver Texas Ranger badges to create a silver bullet.Tonto paints John's face, steals his boots, and sets him on a wooden platform high above the valley floor. John awakes and nearly steps off of the platform. He carefully makes his way off the platform, and Tonto explains that the powerful forces beyond them both have chosen John to be a spirit walker -- a man who cannot be killed in battle. He explains that Butch Cavendish is a wendigo -- a man possessed by a demon with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. Tonto had been tracking Butch for a long time, and managed to smuggle himself onto the train, and was about to kill him when John intervened. John insists on tracking Butch down and bringing him to justice alive. Tonto fashions a leather mask out of Dan's vest; its eyeholes created by a pair of bullets. He tells John to wear the mask and become a symbol that Butch's men will fear.The pair ride into town to Red's Brothel, owned and operated by Red Harrington, a former ballerina who lost her right leg to the cannibal Butch Cavendish. Red's new right leg is an ivory prosthetic, with a rifle hidden inside. A local lawman notices that Tonto is in a club which doesn't allow Indians. He runs to get help. Red relates that Butch's men were there recently and paid for their visit with a giant silver nugget. The nugget is worthless but if she could get it to San Francisco, she could probably get a nice return off the ore.Their conversation is cut short by gunfire within the club because the lawman has returned, this time with an angry mob armed with torches and pitchforks, all hell bent upon killing Tonto. Tonto and John escape. John asks why they wanted to kill Tonto and Tonto explains that the white people are angry at the Comanche Indian tribe because the Comanches have been burning and pillaging white settlements over recent weeks. John, realizing that Dan's wife and son live in the outskirts, heads out to save them.At that moment Rebecca and Danny are at their home in the desert, doing chores when a silence settles. Flaming arrows set the house on fire. They peer out and watch as members of Butch's gang, wearing headdresses and face paint to pass themselves off as Comanche Indians, kill Rebecca's servants. John and Tonto arrive to find the homestead engulfed in flame and smoke, with Rebecca and Danny nowhere to be found. They hear a woman's screaming in the barn. Inside they find one of Butch's men, trying to strip and rape Rebecca's maid. John and Tonto realize that Butch is behind all the recent raids. Butch's men escape and set the barn on fire, with Tonto and John inside. The entire barn is consumed by fire and with no obvious means of exit, John and Tonto are ready to die, when they hear hooves clicking on the barn roof. They look up to see the white horse, on the roof with a rope in its mouth. The horse pulls them out of the fire, and leaps from the roof and escapes.Butch's gang now believe that the masked man, a lone ranger, is the ghost of Dan Reid. Butch's only surviving man escapes back to Butch's hideout. Rebecca and Danny are there, along with the traitorous Collins, and Butch. Butch, now fearing that Dan's ghost is after him because of Rebecca and Danny, orders Collins to shoot the hostages. Collins takes them out of the camp, and is about to shoot them when he tells them to run and fires his gun into the air three times, but is then is shot dead.Tonto and John, who are looking for Butch's hideout, steal one of Butch's horses and follow it into Indian country, with the understanding that the horse will know its way home. They follow it for hours until the horse stops in its tracks and drops dead. John and Tonto, uncertain as to what killed it -- exhaustion probably -- run to its body and find, buried beneath it, railroad tracks. There can't be a train line running through Indian country; it would violate the treaty that the Comanches have had with the US government. Tonto and John, now without a lead to Butch's hideout, bicker.Suddenly, a feathered arrow comes soaring out of nowhere and lands in John's chest. He screams and passes out. John awakens in a tepee, as Tonto painfully pulls the arrow out of him. The Comanches have shot John. The news of the fake Comanche raids on white settlements has angered both sides. John tries to explain the true order of events to the Comanche elders, according to Tonto's customs, but his pleas fall on deaf ears. They explain to John that Tonto is no longer a true Comanche.As a young child Tonto lived in a Comanche settlement similar to their own. One day, while hunting, Tonto came across a pair of young dehydrated white settlers. Tonto slung the two over the back of his horse and led them to his camp and treated them back to health. When they were able, Tonto showed them the nearby Comanche river which contained abundant amounts of silver. In exchange for showing them the silver, Tonto was given a cheap pocket watch. The men filled their bags with silver nuggets and, not wanting anyone else to know the location of the silver, killed Tonto's tribe, leaving Tonto as the sole survivor. They even killed Tonto's crow. On that day Tonto went crazy. He made it his mission to find the men who killed his people, and constantly wears the crow and pocket watch as a reminder of their betrayal.The Comanches bury John and Tonto in dirt, up to their necks, and leave them to bake in the sun while they go to war. The pair of them are soon attacked by scorpions, but the white horse arrives, eats the scorpions and saves them both.John and Tonto are now convinced that Butch is after the silver deposit Tonto spoke of. Tonto shows John the way and the two eventually find themselves at a silver mine, supervised by Butch and worked by hundreds of Chinese immigrants. Many of the men are afraid to go into the mine, citing spooky native spirits who live inside. Butch kills the fearful Chinese workers and sends in a few of his gang members to investigate their claims.Inside the mine, the men are ambushed, knocked out by John and Tonto, and pushed out in a mine car in response. Butch and his men open fire on the mine car, with enough bullets to kill anyone who might be hiding inside. They discover, hidden in the car, a lit bushel of dynamite. The cart explodes, wounding Butch, and killing his men. John and Tonto step out of the mine, and surround Butch.Butch, at first, believes that John is the ghost of his brother, Dan, but soon realizes that ""the Lone Ranger"" is just the lawyer from town. He laughs. Tonto asks John to kill Butch, and forget his moral obligations. John refuses and finding no way to calm Tonto down, knocks him out with a shovel. He ties Butch's hands to the back of his horse and leads him, as a prisoner, back to town, to face justice.Rebecca awakens on Latham Cole's train car. It was Cole who saved them both from Butch's gang and shot Collins. Cole ushers her into the dining car, where dinner awaits them both. Rebecca is woozy. She has always been suspicious of Cole's come-ons, and his advances toward Danny. U.S. Army Captain Jay Fuller knocks on the train car door. He and his cavalry unit have been assigned to defeat the Comanche.John arrives, dragging an exhausted Butch behind his horse. Rebecca and Danny, having heard rumors that it might be Dan, wish to run out and meet him. Cole tells one of his men to take the two into the pantry and hold them at gunpoint. Outside Cole takes custody of Butch and gives him a few good kicks and punches for the cheering crowd, tells his men to put Butch in another car. John is welcomed into the dining car, digs into dinner and begins to notice peculiar items around the table: Rebecca's scarf and a child's toy. He realizes that Rebecca and Danny are on the train, and that Cole is their captor and also realizes that Cole and Butch were the brothers from Tonto's tale. They killed Tonto's tribe for their silver, and have returned to pillage the land and get away.Cole draws a gun on John, but John is too fast and holds Cole at gunpoint, walking him into the neighboring car where he finds Butch relaxing. Guns are drawn by John, Cole, and Danny, who had wrestled a gun away from one of Cole's men. Cole tells Danny that John killed his father, but his lie is transparent. Captain Fuller walks into the commotion, and is convinced by Cole that John is the bad guy.John is arrested and taken to another car. Cole takes his train back to the silver mine. There, Butch shows him and Captain Fuller three massive covered train cars overflowing with silver. John is blindfolded and placed in front of a firing squad, at the command of Captain Fuller. A single migrant (Tonto) saunters out of the mine, holding a cage with a dead bird inside. ""Gas!"" shouts the train conductor. The conductor reverses the train, and pushes a train car between John and firing squad, saving him. He saves John, just as a volley of arrows comes streaking in from the mountain-side. The real Comanches are attacking the miners.Captain Fuller orders the cavalry to shoot the Comanches with a machine gun. During the fight, John and Tonto manage to escape into the mine. Butch chases after them, and throws lit dynamite after them. John and Tonto narrowly avoid being blown up by diving into an underground lake. They wash up on the shore. Cole orders Butch and his men to load his train with the silver cars. The east and west train tracks will soon be united at Promontory Point, and as soon as they are, he'll be able to take the silver to San Francisco, and sell it for a massive fortune.Back in 1930's San Francisco, Tonto tells the boy Will why they robbed the bank: to steal Cole's private stash of TNT and nitroglycerin. They take the stolen explosives, and use them to blow up the bridge a few miles from Promontory Point. They return to Promontory Point where a celebration is being held for the uniting of the two tracks. Cole watches, enviously, as the railroad's President and CEO Habberman gets up on stage and cuts the ribbon. The crowd cheers, the band plays, and Cole invites the railroad board members to have a private meeting on his train.Inside, Cole attempts a takeover of the railroad. He tells all the railroad board members them all that he's about to take a train with $65,000,000 worth of silver to San Francisco, and using that money he'll buy the railroad, which will enable him to control the country. Habberman laughs off Cole's plans, calling them ludicrous, and is shot in the leg.Tonto sneaks onto the other train, commandeers the engine, and puts it in reverse, in the direction of the destroyed bridge. Captain Fuller orders his men to fire upon Tonto with the machine gun, but Tonto is saved by John who appears, on horseback, riding over the tops of buildings. Cole orders Butch and his men to start the second train and to go after Tonto.Cole, Butch, and Fuller chase after Tonto with John riding his horse across the top of the train. Rebecca and Danny are held captive inside the second train. Tonto manages to hit a switch-track, forcing the second train onto a separate route. Multiple cars are uncoupled from their engines, and ultimately Butch and Fuller end up on two separate cars which collide, killing them both. Cole, having moved to the train being piloted by Tonto, prepares to kill him when John, using his melted-down silver bullet, shoots the gun out of Cole's hand. Tonto escapes the train, now being piloted by Cole, who has his rail cars full of silver behind him. Cole, convinced that he has a clean escape to San Francisco, arrives at the destroyed bridge. Cole's train, along with the silver, flies off the tracks, into the water below. Cole is subsequently buried by his silver, and dies. The train, which Tonto and John were riding, along with dozens of innocent bystanders, comes to a stop before plunging off the destroyed bridge.At Promontory Point, Habberman and the crowd applaud John for saving the day and killing Cole. Habberman tries to convince John to give up his outlaw ways, and reveal his true identity to the people. John refuses and takes off on his horse eventually meeting Tonto sitting on a bluff, overlooking the valley beneath them. John tells Tonto that he's decided to name the white horse ""Silver"". Tonto likes the name but tells John, very seriously, to never repeat the phrase ""Hi-Ho! Silver Away!""In 1930's San Francisco, the old Tonto is preparing to go home after a long day's work. He puts on a jacket and a bowler hat, and trades the kid a silver bullet before heading off into the night."
Oblivion,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A veteran assigned to extract Earth's remaining resources begins to question what he knows about his mission and himself. One of the few remaining drone repairmen assigned to Earth, its surface devastated after decades of war with the alien Scavs, discovers a crashed spacecraft with contents that bring into question everything he believed about the war, and may even put the fate of mankind in his hands.—Black Dahlia Jack Harper is one of the last few drone repairmen stationed on Earth. Part of a massive operation to extract vital resources after decades of war with a terrifying threat known as the Scavs, Jack's mission is nearly complete. Living in and patrolling the skies from thousands of feet above, his existence is brought crashing down when he rescues a stranger from a downed spacecraft. Her arrival triggers a chain of events that forces him to question everything he knows and puts the fate of humanity in his hands.—Universal Pictures In 2077, the human Jack Harper works with his companion Victoria ""Vica"" on the surveillance station Tech 49. Jack repairs drones and his memory was erased as part of the security process to stay on Earth, and he knows that Earth is completely depleted after sixty years of war against the alien invaders Scavengers ""Scavs"". The aliens have destroyed the moon and were defeated by nuclear weapons and the earthlings have moved to Saturn's moon Titan since the planet was completely destroyed. Now Jack has to protect the power stations that use the ocean to supply energy to Titan fixing the drones. He also has recollections of a mysterious woman at the Empire State Building when Earth was habitable. Jack and Vic receive instructions from Sally (Melissa Leo), who is located on the space station Tet, and Vic is anxious to leave Earth in two weeks to join the survivors on Titan.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Sixty dark years after the victorious but utterly devastating war against an unforeseen alien invasion which left humanity practically on the verge of extinction, most of the remaining earthlings have long since they relocated on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, in 2077. Left behind in the uninhabitable and barren Earth along with a handful of survivors and the extraterrestrial invaders, is the drone technician, Jack Harper, and the communications teammate, Victoria Olsen, who monitor the planet before mankind's final migration to Titan. However, when the plagued with unexplained visions, Jack, rescues the cryptic woman in his dreams, flashbacks of a fragmented memory will soon unearth a startling secret about his mission. In the end, what is the real threat, and above all, who cloaks the truth?—Nick Riganas In the year 2077, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is a drone technician living in a tower high above the clouds with his assigned partner Victoria/Vika (Andrea Riseborough). They are the last people left on Earth after it was destroyed by aliens known as the Scavengers/'Scavs', who wanted Earth's resources. The Scavs destroyed Earth's moon for material resources, which caused a series of natural disasters and global devastation, then they invaded. In the ensuing war, humans were forced to use nuclear weapons. In the end, humans won the war but lost the Earth by turning most of it into a radioactive wasteland. The entire remaining human population moved to Titan, one of the moons of Saturn, with a select number inhabiting a large spaceship in orbit around Earth called the Tet. Giant machines are drawing up seawater to extract energy for humanity's new home.Jack's job is to journey to the surface during the day to repair the drones. These are spherical, flying robots designed to detect and terminate remaining Scavs on Earth. Vika's job is to stay inside the Tower to keep an eye on him as his coordinator and to correspond with and get their mission objectives from Sally (Melissa Leo), the mission commander on the Tet.Jack repairs drones within an area containing what looks like the remains of New York/Manhattan. He repairs drone #166 one day in the Superbowl Stadium and reminds Vika that he would love to have watched the last game in 2017. He encounters a dog and is able to send it away before Drone #166 fully recovers and kills it. He then goes on to find another lost drone inside the New York Public Library, but it is revealed to be a trap set up by the Scavs. Luckily, the drone from earlier, #166, saves Jack from this encounter. The drones have incredible fire-power and maneuverability. Jack finds a book and decides to take it home. He remembers a verse inside it about Horatius.Jack returns to the Tower for the night again and has dinner with Vika. She is excited that they are only two weeks away from completing their mission and will soon be on their way to join the rest of humanity on Titan. Jack, however, is unsure - he doesn't want to leave yet. He has been getting flashbacks and having dreams of a time before 'the war' though he knows these can't be real as he was given an obligatory memory wipe before starting his mission as 'the mop-up crew'. Jack gifts Vika some flowers he has been tending, but she discards them by dropping them from the Tower because it goes against regulations and they could contain ""thousands of toxins"". They later go for a swim, and during a kiss, Jack has another flashback of a particular woman. In the morning, the two awake to a mushroom cloud explosion in the distance - one of the water processing machines has exploded.The next day, Jack goes back to work and is instructed to investigate a beacon signal from the bombed-out Empire State building. They discover the signal is coded coordinates. Believing it to be the work of the Scavs, he cuts the wire. He then tells Vika that he'll perform a perimeter check around the border where the 'radiation zone' meets the safe area, but really he is visiting his secret house by a lake, in a lush green valley hidden away from view. He falls asleep on the grass and awakes to see objects parachuting down from the sky. They crash land right on the coordinates from the transmission. He flies to investigate and finds humans in delta-sleep pods scattered about the wreck. Drones arrive and begin destroying all of the pods. He discovers one of the pods contains the woman from his flashback dreams and is able to save her by using himself as a shield (the drones are programmed to not terminate Jack). He takes the pod back up to the Tower, where Vika manages to wake the woman from deep sleep. We find out her name is Julia (Olga Kurylenko). Vika is not happy at having her stay with them, and against Jack's wishes, she reports Julia's presence to Sally, who requests Jack take Julia up to the Tet.At sunrise Julia encourages Jack to go with her to collect the data recorder from her crashed spaceship; she needs to know what happened. He takes her, without Vika knowing. After they retrieve it, Jack realizes they are surrounded by Scavs. He sends the aircraft back on autopilot emergency return just before being knocked unconscious by a Scav and transported to their home base.Jack awakens to find himself captured and tied to a chair. The Scavs reveal themselves to be human, not the alien species that invaded Earth. They tell Jack the real aliens are inside the Tet, and the drones are actually programmed to kill any remaining humans. The leader of the Scav/Human resistance, Beech (Morgan Freeman), asks Jack for his help. They have a stolen drone along with ten power cells from other drones they have brought down, and they have scavenged the weapons-grade plutonium power core from the wrecked ship Julia was on. This has allowed them to turn the stolen drone into a nuclear bomb that can destroy the Tet. They hope that Jack, as a skilled drone technician, will help them reprogram the drone. He refuses, still believing there are humans on board the Tet. Beech releases them and tells Jack that if he is looking for the truth, he will find it in the forbidden 'radiation zone.'The two ride Jack's motorbike until it runs out of fuel, then hike to the Empire State building where Jack manages to send a signal to Vika. She sends the aircraft to pick them up. On the balcony viewing area, Julia tells Jack who she really is. They were both from the spacecraft Odyssey, and she is his real wife, before he had his memory erased. He remembers, and they share an embrace just as the aircraft arrives. Vika sees this. Jack and Julia go back to the Tower, where an upset and jealous Vika sends a message to Sally saying she and Jack are no longer an ""effective team."" A damaged drone Jack has stored for repairs on a lower floor of the Tower activates to terminate the failed maintenance team. Vika is vaporized, but just before it kills Jack, Julia shoots it with the aircraft gun.Jack and Julia fly away and are soon being chased by three other drones. In an attempt to destroy them, they fly into a lightning storm and then into a canyon. Jack manages to destroy two but the third, #166, rams them, and they crash into a sandy desert in the radiation zone. Jack realizes that he is not boiling alive as he was led to believe would happen if he ventured into the radiation zone. He also hears the familiar distress beep of a broken drone just over the next sand dune. Upon investigating, Jack witnesses another technician in an identical aircraft land to fix the drone, despite his being told there were no other people on Earth.Jack confronts the technician and is shocked to see himself - it is a clone known as Jack Harper 52. They get into a fight, and during the brawl, Julia is shot in the abdomen. Jack uses 52's plane to go to 52's Tower and collect a med-kit for Julia, and there he sees another Vika. He is stunned by the elaborate unraveling of everything he knew to be true but manages to trick this Vika into believing he is her Jack.After saving Julia, they take refuge in the lake house, and re-connect. Jack decides to help the human resistance and returns to assist in programming the drone. However, during this time, Sally has sent another three drones after Jack. By following his DNA trail, the drones arrive at the Scavs' home base and attack all of the humans, leaving few survivors. Beech is mortally wounded, and the captured drone is no longer functional. The fuel cells remain intact, though, and they decide the only way they can still transport the bomb into the Tet is by hiding it in a delta-sleep pod with Julia, bringing her to the Tet as Sally had requested (to make a ""more effective team"").Jack flies to the Tet with the delta-sleep pod. On the way, he listens to the data recorder recovered from the Odyssey. Jack hears himself as the Odyssey pilot approaching the Tet in the 2017 first contact, the day after the Superbowl. Vika is co-pilot and Julia is one of the crew members in hibernation. They were being guided by the real Sally, a NASA cap com. The Odyssey began to accelerate uncontrollably towards the Tet, and in order to save the crew and Julia, Jack released the back shuttle with the delta-sleep pods, leaving only him and Vika heading towards the Tet.Jack (Tech 49), now at the Tet, is allowed entry. The alien (Sally) is suspicious and questions Jack's motives for coming. It nearly destroys him after physiological signs of lying are detected, but he tricks it by truthfully stating he wants the human race to survive, and this (being willing servants, ostensibly, but really he means the Tet's destruction) is the only way. He is allowed to proceed further inside to deliver Julia. Along the way he sees a multitude of clones of himself and Vika growing in pods. In the alien's presence (revealed to be a large floating pyramidal object with a red laser eye in the center), Jack opens the delta-sleep pod. Inside is not Julia but the wounded Beech. Realizing the deception, the alien summons drones to destroy them and pleads ""I created you, Jack, I am your God,"" but together Jack and Beech detonate the fuel cells.Julia wakes up by the lake house. Sitting up in the sleeper pod, she witnesses the Tet explode spectacularly in the sky and weeps.Three years later, Julia is living in the lake house with her daughter.

Insidious: Chapter 2,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2226417/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Lamberts believe that they have defeated the spirits that have haunted their family, but they soon discover that evil is not beaten so easily. Renai is interrogated by a police detective about the supernatural events in the house. While the police investigate the house, the Lambert family temporarily moves to the old house of Lorraine Lambert. Renai is haunted by a woman in white and Josh has a strange behavior at home. Meanwhile Lorraine seeks out Elise's partners Specs and Tucker expecting to find answers.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 1986, Lorraine Lambert summons demonology's Elise Rainier to help her son Josh, who is being followed by the spirit of an old woman. After investigating the house and encountering paranormal phenomena, Elise tells Lorraine that they must suppress Josh's astral projection abilities for his own safety. Twenty-five years later, Renai Lambert is under questioning about the death of Elise. She is warned that if her husband Josh's fingerprints are found at the crime scene, he will be prosecuted for Elise's murder. The Lambert family relocate to Lorraine's house as the investigation continues. Renai and the others begin to experience strange, seemingly paranormal activity in the house.. In flashback, we see Josh (Patrick Wilson) Lambert, as a kid, is having trouble with the old lady with blood red lipstick, who killed Elise at the end of the first film. Elise and a man named Carl, are summoned to help with the problem, because Josh's mother, Lorraine, is worried. In time, they find out he's a special ability of astral projection during his sleep. Elsie asks if she can interview Josh, and as we see Josh through the viewfinder of an old VHS camera, Elsie begins asking Josh questions, whose answers make her tremble. Next, Elsie asks Josh to play a game of 'hot & cold' with Elise, and they find him talking to someone and a door opens, without any visible means.We're in the present day.Renai is speaking with a police detective (Michael Beach) about the death of Elise, and the detective says he will get in touch with her as to whether-or-not the marks on Elise were by Josh's hands. The Lambert family moves in with Lorraine, to try and get away from the things which they experienced in the first film.But as soon as they get there, things are begin again to happen.They first begin with Renai, hearing the piano playing and the baby chair making noises, and moving back-and-forth. Soon, feeling things are still not right, Lorraine walks in on a sleeping Dalton, who (though sleeping) tells Lorraine someone's behind her. Lorraine goes into the bathroom, and is locked in, and sees a lady.When the door opens, Josh's behind the door and says everything is okay.With such things happening, everyone is on edge, and while Josh is taking the kids to school, Renai gets jumpy. She sets things up with the baby (baby speakers) and she then sees a woman on the couch in Victorian dress.The lady gets up and Renai hears her talking to the baby through the speakers, in a malevolent tone. Renai runs up the stairs to the room only for the door to slam shut on her face and lock. Renai hears the lady talking to the baby, and hears the lady smack the baby while it cries. The door opens, and the baby's missing.Renai runs downsstairs and the lady catches her off-guard, and screams; ""HOW DARE YOU!!"" and smacks her so hard she's knocked out.Meanwhile, Lorraine's troubled by the strange sightings, and the way Josh has been behaving, and decides to visit Specks and Tucker (the 2 paranormal investigators who worked with Elise when she was alive in the previous film), to try and see if there's a way to uncover what the cause of the strange goings-ons could be.Specks and Tucker are unable to help her, but when Lorraine says, ""if only Elise was still here,"" they remember who to contact: Carl, the spirit medium from 1986.Carl appears at Elise's house, and apologises for not contacting them sooner, out of fear of what he saw back then.He listens to Lorraine's story, and decides to contact Elise on the other side with the usage of word dice to allow Elise to reply to their questions. Lorraine, Specs and Tucker sit around a table, as Carl begins to ask Elise questions. He rolls the word dice and asks Elise if she is there, and 3 dice placed together spell ""yes"". He then asks Elise ""who killed you?"", rolls the dice and gets the reply; 'she did.' Carl asks; 'where is she?, rolls the dice and get a reply; 'hiding.' They ask where, and the die spell out; 'Our Lady of Angels,' a now-abandoned hospital which Lorraine used to work at, and where Lorraine said the ordeal with Josh had begun.Back at Lorraine's home, Josh returns home, and finds Renai on the floor unconscious, a visually troubled Josh can be seen trying to pick up Renai from the floor, but his personality abruptly changes, and he begins to sniff Renai's skin and hair.Renai regains consciousness, saying their baby has been stolen, but Josh calms her, and shows their daughter is in the crib, asleep. Renai attempts to convince Josh that something's attacking them again, and they must move away because of what happened. A stubborn Josh denies her request and says the problems would disappear if they ignore them.Just then, both Renai and Josh hear the piano playing, and they go together to find the cause of the sound, but there's no one present at the piano. Renai realises the tune being played on the piano is the one she wrote for Josh, but when she tells this to Josh this, he shows no memory of this.Due to rising suspicion from Renai about Josh's well-being, Josh rushes Renai out of the room, telling her not to worry and as Josh looks back into the room he smiles and says 'your home is the shadows, now.' As he leaves, the real Josh in astral-projection form, is sitting at the piano - in the shadows, and bangs the keys, and screams, 'Help!'The next morning, Dalton speaks to his mother Renai about his reappearing nightmares involving the dead and the old woman, but more importantly, he's greatly troubled by what he has seen in his father. The night Renai confronts Josh about seeing the woman in their house, Dalton manages to see from a corner of a hallway in the house, his father Josh scolding himself profusely, and speaking to another individual, and saying the other individual must leave and go away. Dalton, clearly aware of the fact that nobody else was with his father when he was speaking, and tells Renai the next morning that the physical Josh Lambert is not occupied by the soul of his father; the true Josh Lambert.Lorraine, Specs, Tucker, and Carl go to the abandoned Our Lady of Angels hospital, and Carl helps them find the right room. Lorraine remembers the room was an ICU unit she worked in, and where it all began.Back in 1986, Lorraine and Josh walked into the room, and they see a patient named Parker Crane who's asleep. Josh looks away, to the machines, and suddenly Parker attacks him, as the nurses hold him down and Lorraine and her son quickly leave. Later, Lorraine getting on an elevator, and Parker gets on, as well. She tries to make small talk - saying he should be in bed, not roaming the halls, but, he does not respond. They arrive on the main floor, and Parker heads silently off towards the left, as Lorraine heads for the lobby, and goes to the receptionist and asks her why Parker Cranes' up and walking. The receptionist tells Lorraine Parker Crane had jumped off of the building that morning, and died.Back in the present, Lorraine, Specs, Tucker, and Carl go find the records on Parker Crane, and find out where his house was. They find it abandoned. Specs and Tucker go up to Parker's room and find a little girl who tells them to go before her mother finds them and she has to kill them. Carl goes back down stairs and uses his dice, and is soon joined by Lorraine. They realise the person who'd been communicating with them through the dice wasn't Elise, but Parker Crane's mother, who called herself 'Mater Mortis,' in Latin; 'mother death'.Just then, the crystal chandelier - which was being slowly unscrewed, crashes down, narrowly missing killing them.They enter another room - one hidden behind a bookcase, only to find people sitting in rows under cloths, and a chestful of newspaper articles on a serial killer who wore a black wedding dress. They find the black wedding dress on a mannequin. Carl puts his hand on the dress to find out what went on with it, and sees a man putting on women's makeup as a woman sits - tied-up behind him and screams, who he murders.They figure out Parker was the serial killer - 'The Black Bride' - who put on the black wedding dress and killed young woman, under his mother's direction, which explains who the people are under the cloths;his victims.With this information, they understand what they're really dealing with, and head home to tranquillise Josh (who's inhabited by Parker Crane's spirit), in order to get into him out of Josh.But things go wrong, and Carl is killed whilst Specs gets knocked unconscious, and 'Josh' stabs Tucker with the hypodermic syringe, rendering him unconscious.Now in the Further/Shadows, Carl finds Josh and they figure they need to get Josh back in his body, so they try to find Elise. They go to Josh's old house (from Insidious 1), where they see the long-haired man from the first film pacing back-and-forth (just as RenaI saw in the first film) and all-of-the-sudden, he's inside the window - behind the curtain, in the babies room where RenaI sees him, and screams.Just as he's going to try to take and kill the baby, Elise pops out and kills the demon, by pushing it through the window.Elise tells Josh and Carl they must go back to the place where Parker and his mother once lived, in order to try to end it, for once and for all.In present time, (Carl inhabiting) 'Josh' sends a text to Renai, saying it's safe to go to the house. They drive over, and are attacked by 'Josh.' Dalton comes and hits him long enough for Renai and the 2 boys to run into the basement and hide. Dalton then goes asleep to try and help rescue Josh's soul.In the Further, they arrive at Lorraine's house where they find the way to the old lady's house, and enter. They find Parker on the bed, dressed as a girl. Parker's yelling - saying his name's Parker. His mother walks in with a drawing Parker made, and yells at him yells, 'DID YOU DO THIS?!?'He denies at first, then says 'yes.' She yells; 'HOW DARE YOU,' and smacks him, because she says his name isn't Parker - that's what his father named him. His 'real' name is 'Marilyn.'Just then, the mother looks over, and becomes aware of Carl and Josh watching, and she screams at them and Elise and Carl are hurtled backwards out of the room and the door slams violently shut, with Josh still inside.Parker's mother faces Josh, and makes all the people whom Parker killed, appear in the room under white sheets. They proceed to taunt Josh.In realtime, Josh's just about into the basement to attack Renai and the boys. He breaks in past their barriers, and pushes Renai down to kill her. He's momentarily distracted when he sees Dalton asleep. As he raises a hammer to kill Dalton, Dalton, Josh, and Elise in the Further are being assisted by Parker who is the only one who can open his childhood bedroom door which Mrs. Crane had slammed shut. Once he does this, Elise beats Mrs. Crane with a rocking horse and destroys her memories, once and for all. As Parker destroys all memories of his mother. Elise tells Carl and Josh they must leave, as this existence is quickly crumbling, and tells Carl she felt his heartbeat, and he's still alive.Josh and Carl run out of the room, as it's disintegrating, leaving Elsie. They leave the Further, and in the darkness, they fight off attacking spirits, who are anxious to leave the Shadows for our world. As they fight the spirits, they find Dalton, and make their way back into the real world,In present time, they all wake up in their normal bodies with their own spirits. In the next scene, they are all seated in Josh's living room before Carl who tells him that he can now hypnotise them, just as Elise did to young Josh back in 1986, and make them forget how to astral project, preventing them from going back to the Further in their dreams and inadvertently bringing spirits back with them.They close their eyes; the camera zooms in on Josh's face, serene and beginning to forget.Epilogue -Instead of the usual fade to black, the screen slowly brightens to a blinding white and then we see a sky filled with clouds. The camera pans down from the sky to a different house where Specs and Tucker knock on the door and are greeted by a family. Specs tells the man to please hear him out; Specs and Tucker are there to deliver a message to their relative, Allison. Allison is the sole survivor of the Bride in Black's killing spree, the only one who got away and gave a description to the police for the story in the newspaper that was found earlier in Parker Crane's dilapidated house.At the door, the family's little girl asks them, ""Who's the woman behind you?"" Specs and Turner turn around and see no one. Next, we see through the little girl's eyes, and Elise is standing behind them. She smiles at the little girl and puts her finger to her mouth, saying ""shhhh"". She walks past them into the house where a young woman sits unresponsive in a wheelchair. In the background, we can hear the parents of the little girl telling Specs and Turner that they have been having problems with unseen, malevolent entities in their home. Elise crouches in front of Allison, smiles kindly, and begins talking to her, trying to help draw her out of the Further. She hears something above them, looks up, sees the light fixtures swaying - and something else - and her smile disappears. Then we hear a creaking, grotesque, guttural noise in the shadowy corner of the room behind Allison. The camera pans up; we see nothing - yet - behind her; but Elise does, and the expression on her face is one of abject terror, as she exclaims, trembling; 'Oh, my god!'"
Saving Mr. Banks,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140373/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"AuthorP.L. Traversreflects on her childhood after reluctantly meeting withWalt Disney, who seeks to adapt her Mary Poppins books for the big screen. When Walt Disney's (Tom Hanks') daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book,P.L. Travers' (Emma Thompson's) ""Mary Poppins"", he made them a promise - one that he didn't realize would take twenty years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles, California to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all of the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Richard M. Sherman (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert B. Sherman (B.J. Novak), Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing movies in cinematic history.—Walt Disney Pictures Walter Elias Disney (Tom Hanks) wants to use the book ""Mary Poppins"" for a movie but author P.L. Travers (Dame Emma Thompson) doesn't like what he does. So for twenty years, Disney kept asking her to let him do it. Eventually, when she's financially strapped, she considers it, but won't approve unless Disney does it as she wants it. So she goes to Los Angeles, California and Disney and his team, who work on bringing the character of Mary Poppins to life, try to show her what they did. But she's not easily impressed. Even Disney tries to understand what she wants.—rcs0411@yahoo.com 1961. For twenty years through their respective representatives, Walter Elias Disney (Tom Hanks) has tried so far unsuccessfully to purchase the rights from British authorP.L. Travers(Dame Emma Thompson) for her series of Mary Poppins books to make into a movie. Travers has felt protective of her material, especially against Disney, as she sees the Disney brand as not meshing with her stories. She fears that Disney will turn the stories into a saccharine animated mess as she doesn't want her Mary Poppins to become synonymous with Mickey Mouse. But Travers, who has not written voluntarily in years and is running out of money, agrees now at least to meet with Disney's representatives in Los Angeles, California to go through the script, as she has managed to gain script approval before she signs over the rights, something Disney has never agreed to with anyone else. Those representatives are most specifically the project's ScreenwriterDon DaGradi(Bradley Whitford) and Songwriter brothersRichard M. Sherman(Jason Schwartzman) andRobert B. Sherman(B.J. Novak), the latter two who irk Travers, if only because she also does not see a Mary Poppins movie as being a musical. Disney and Travers find that they are the antithesis of each other in almost every respect, his casualness in dealing with people on a first name basis against her wishes to be more formal in calling and being called by one's surname preceded by the appropriate honorific only the most obvious example. Although not in the script meetings, Disney gets wind either directly or indirectly of the difficulties in the script negotiations, where he sees most of her demands as being overly unreasonable to kibosh the project purposefully. For the negotiations to be successful, Disney and his representatives will have to learn that Travers' protectiveness is due to the relationships she had with who were the inspirations for the characters of Mary Poppins, and most specifically, Mr. George W. Banks.—Huggo Author P. L. Travers (Dame Emma Thompson) created a famous fictional character resembles her childhood memories named ""Mary Poppins"". Even after the worldwide success of the book, she remained over-protective towards her characters by not being keen to transform her dreams into the movies. She hates that any producer might turn this novel, which is an integral part of her early life, to a mere child comedy. Cometh the famed producer Walter Elias Disney (Tom Hanks), who was inclined to turn this novel into a movie after being read it by his daughter who was absolutely in love with the character. To make his dream a reality, he persuades P. L. Travers to every possible extent. After the initial clashes of personalities, ultimately, Travers gives in to the tenacity of Disney, thus, a gem of a movie is created.—Spandan Roy In London in 1961, financially struggling author Pamela ""P. L."" Travers (Emma Thompson) reluctantly agrees to travel to Los Angeles to meet with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) at the urging of her agent Diarmuid Russell (Ronan Vibert). Disney has been courting Travers for 20 years, seeking to acquire the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories, on account of his daughters' request to make a film based on the character. Travers, however, has been extremely hesitant toward letting Disney adapt her creation to the screen because he is known primarily as a producer of animated films, which Travers openly disdains.Her youth in Allora, Queensland in 1906 is depicted through flashbacks, and is shown to be the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers was very close to her handsome and charismatic father Travers Robert Goff (Colin Farrell), who fought a losing battle against alcoholism.Upon her arrival in Los Angeles, Travers is disgusted by what she feels is the city's unreality, as well as by the naive optimism and intrusive friendliness of its inhabitants, personified by her assigned limo driver, Ralph (Paul Giamatti).
At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers begins collaborating with the creative team assigned to develop Mary Poppins for the screen, screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak respectively). She finds their presumptions and casual manners as highly improper, a view she also reciprocates on the jocular Disney upon meeting him in person.Travers' working relationship with the creative team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his associates are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the fantastical nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own richly imaginative childhood existence. Travers has particular trouble with the team's depiction of George Banks. Travers describes Banks' characterization as completely off-base and leaves a session distraught. The team begins to grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to Travers, and how many of the work's characters are directly inspired by Travers' own past.For ex Mr Bank's character is based on Traver's own father, who was an alcoholic & a manager at a Bank in Australia. Traver's father was not very successful at his job due to his drinking problem & is often ridiculed by his boss in front of his daughters & the public. Traver's father tries very hard, but is eventually diagnosed with liver trouble due to his drinking. Disney's creative team, going through her books, interprets Bank's character as a cruel banker, who is out to scam people. This does not go down well with Travers.In fact, the character Mary Poppins is also loosely based on the nanny that her parents hired when Travers's father was diagnosed with problems. The new nanny is a stickler to discipline & promises to fix everything. Even then, shortly thereafter, Travers's dad dies & she blames the nanny as she had ""promised to fix everything"".Travers' collaboration with the team continues, although she is increasingly disengaged as painful memories from her past numb her in the present. Seeking to find out what's troubling her, Disney invites Travers to Disneyland, which-along with her progressive friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to George Banks, and the insertion of a new song to close the film-help to soften Travers. Her imagination begins to reawaken, and she engages enthusiastically with the creative team.This progress is upended, however, when Travers discovers that an animation sequence is being planned for the film, a decision that she has been adamantly against of accepting. She confronts and denounces a protesting Disney, angrily declaring that she will not sign over the film rights and returns to London. Disney discovers that Travers is writing under a pen name; her real name being Helen Goff. Equipped with new insight, he departs for London, determined to salvage the film. Appearing unexpectedly at Travers' residence, Disney opens up-describing his own less-than-ideal childhood, while stressing the healing value of his art-and urges her to shed her deeply-rooted disappointment with the world. Travers relents and grants him the film rights.Three years later, in 1964, Mary Poppins is nearing its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Travers has not been invited because Disney fears that she will give the film negative publicity. Goaded by her agent, Travers returns to Los Angeles, showing up uninvited in Disney's office, and finagles an invitation to the premiere. She watches Mary Poppins initially with scorn, reacting with particular dismay to the animated sequence. She slowly warms to the film, however, and is ultimately surprised to find herself overcome by emotion, touched by the depiction of George Banks' redemption, which clearly possesses a powerful personal significance for her.
During the end credits, a surviving recording of one of the actual sessions between Travers, the Sherman Brothers and DaGradi plays out."

Out of the blue, the White House is invaded and overtaken by a terrorist group led by Stenz, and Cale fights against the paramilitary group to save his daughter and the president while disclosing high treason and coup d'état sponsored by the arms industry.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Dejected after being turned down for a position with the Secret Service but unable to break the news to his adoring daughter, Capitol policeman John Cale (Channing Tatum) is taking her on a tour of the White House when a powerful explosion rips through the building, sparking mass chaos. When the smoke clears, Cale learns that heavily armed rebels have taken both his daughter (Joey King) and the president (Jamie Foxx) hostage. As news of the attack creates mass panic and fear of total collapse, Cale realizes that the fate of his daughter, the Commander in Chief, and the entire nation rest in his willingness to fight back against the terrorists who have brought the most powerful nation on the planet to its knees.. John Cale (Channing Tatum) is a United States Capitol Police officer assigned to Speaker of the House of Representatives Eli Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) after Cale saved Raphelson's nephew's life during a tour in Afghanistan. Cale is struggling to develop a better relationship with his daughter Emily (Joey King), who has a strong enthusiasm for politics. He hopes to impress her by getting a job with the Secret Service, but the interview is conducted by Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a former college acquaintance of his who believes that he is unqualified due to a lack of respect for authority. After lying to Emily about the outcome of the interview, she and Cale join a tour of the White House. At the same time, U.S. President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) proposes a controversial peace treaty between allied countries to remove military forces from the Middle East.Meanwhile, a man disguised as a janitor detonates a bomb at the center of the United States Capitol, causing the collapse of the building's dome. Raphelson - who was in the Capitol but is uninjured - and Finnerty are taken to a secure command center underneath the Pentagon while Vice President Alvin Hammond (Michael Murphy) is taken aboard Air Force One. The White House is put on lockdown separating Cale from Emily (who had left the tour group to use the restroom). Meanwhile, mercenaries led by Emil Stenz (Jason Clarke) start killing off most of the Secret Service and take the tour group hostage, but Cale manages to take a gun from a mercenary named Carl Killick (Kevin Rankin) and escapes to go and find his daughter. Meanwhile, retiring Head of the Presidential Detail Martin Walker (James Woods) escorts President Sawyer and his detail to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. Once Sawyer gains access, Walker kills everyone else in Sawyer's detail, revealing himself to be the leader of the attack; he wants revenge for his son who was killed during a botched black ops mission. Cale, who fails to find Emily, kills a mercenary and takes his gun and radio. Using the radio, Cale locates and rescues the President.Walker and Stenz bring in Skip Tyler (Jimmi Simpson) to hack into the defense system, but they still require Sawyer to activate the nuclear football. Emily, while hiding, records a video of the mercenaries and uploads it to YouTube before eventually being captured by Killick. Walker demands $400 million from the Federal Reserve as ransom for the hostages. Cale and Sawyer manage to get in contact with the Pentagon, and Finnerty tells Cale to get Sawyer out through a series of secret underground tunnels. Finnerty then uses Emily's video to discover the mercenaries' identities, discovering that they used to work for various government agencies and radical political groups. They are informed that Stenz, a former Special Forces operative, was disavowed and burned on mission, leading to his capture by the Taliban. They also discover that Walker has terminal cancer, suggesting his involvement to be a suicide mission and that the attack is not for ransom. Cale and Sawyer find the tunnel gate rigged with an explosive and are forced to escape in a presidential limousine. After a car chase/shootout with Stenz on the White House lawn, Cale and Sawyer are flipped into the White House pool after Cale gets distracted by the sight of Killick holding Emily at gunpoint. A gunfight erupts which results in an explosion that leaves Sawyer and Cale presumed dead. Aboard Air Force One, Hammond is then sworn in as President.When Cale and Sawyer reveal they are still alive, they learn Hammond has approved an aerial incursion by Delta Force to take back the White House. Knowing the mercenaries have Javelin surface-to-air missiles, Cale tries but fails to stop the mercenaries from shooting down the helicopters. Cale gets into a fight with Stenz and ends up dropping his White House passes for himself and Emily while escaping. Having already learned of Emily from the video, Stenz, knowing that she is Cale's daughter, takes her to Walker in the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Tyler finishes the upload to NORAD and launches a missile at Air Force One, killing everyone on board, including Hammond. Raphelson is then sworn in as President and, in a last ditch effort to end the crisis, orders an air strike on the White House. Finnerty informs Cale of Raphelson's decision.Walker tells Cale over the White House intercom to surrender Sawyer or he will shoot Emily. Sawyer ultimately surrenders himself to save Emily, knowing Cale could still save them both if he was free. Holding the pair in the Oval Office, Walker reveals to Sawyer that his motive for the attack was to convey a message of American power. Because of Sawyer's dislike of military force, as well as backing out of the mission that killed his son, Walker had grown to believe Sawyer was too weak to be President; by launching a nuclear attack on Iran, Walker had hoped to regain international respect for America and avenge his own personal loss. He asks for Sawyer to activate the nuclear football. Sawyer refuses, and tries to convince Walker that his son did not die in vain, and that the peace treaty was a form of victory. When Walker threatens to shoot Emily again, the alarms and sprinklers are activated by Cale setting fire to the Lincoln Bedroom. In the chaos, Tyler tries to escape but encounters the tunnel gate bomb. When he tries to deactivate it, it detonates instead, killing him. Killick finds Cale and tries to kill him, but is ambushed by Donnie Smith, the White House tour guide (Nicolas Wright), who bludgeons Killick to death with a clock. After freeing the hostages and entrusting Donnie to get them out safely, Cale battles Stenz and ultimately kills him with a grenade belt. Using the explosion to catch him off guard, Sawyer attacks a distracted Walker, but Walker gains the upper hand and forces Sawyer to activate the football before apparently shooting him dead. Using updated launch codes from an anonymous source, Walker targets various cities in Iran, but before he can initiate the launch, Cale smashes through the wall of the Oval Office with a presidential SUV, and kills Walker with the SUV's minigun. Cale warns Emily of the air strike, and she takes a presidential flag and waves it on the front lawn, prompting the pilots to call off the attack. Meanwhile, Sawyer reveals himself to be alive since the bullet that hit him hit a pocket watch his wife (Garcelle Beauvais) had given him. Finnerty calls them to reveal that the mercenaries were not hired by Walker, and that there is another person behind the attack. Cale realizes who it is and asks Sawyer for his help in exposing the person.Later, Finnerty arrives at the White House with Raphelson. When Cale tells them Sawyer was killed, Raphelson then orders troops to be placed back into the Middle East, which would go against Sawyer's peace treaty. Cale then reveals Raphelson had conspired with Walker to orchestrate the attack because of Raphelson's opposition to Sawyer's treaty and then proves it by having Finnerty call the call-back number on Walker's pager, which was the source of the updated launch codes. Sawyer arrives and has Raphelson taken into custody, treating his taking of the Presidency as a coup d'état. Sawyer then officially offers Cale a job in the Secret Service and takes him and Emily on an aerial tour of Washington, D.C. on his way to the hospital. Realizing an increased need for peace due to the day's events, Russia, Iran, China, and other Middle Eastern and Asian countries agree to sign Sawyer's peace treaty."
Mama,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2023587/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a young couple take in their two nieces, they suspect that a supernatural spirit named Mama has latched onto their family. Jeffrey Desange, senior partner of an investment brokerage, has a breakdown after a financial collapse and kills several co-workers and his estranged wife and kidnaps his two young daughters, Victoria and Lily. When they're found five years later, they're taken in by their uncle (their father's twin brother) and his girlfriend.

Lily and Victoria are left in the woods alone. Five years later Victoria and Lily they are in the care of their uncle and his girlfriend, who are left to wonder after a few strange events: were Victoria and Lily really alone in the woods or did something follow them?—devint-16816 Five years after the tragic death of their parents, close sisters Victoria and Lily who were left stranded in the unwelcoming woods, reunite unexpectedly with their father's twin brother Lucas, and his girlfriend Annabel. Doubtlessly, how two frail young unprotected children managed to survive on their own for so long is nothing less than a miracle, but there must have been someone--or even something--protecting them in the gloomy, dangerous forest. Little by little, Annabel suspects that although the girls are settling into this safe, loving atmosphere, whoever/whatever it was is still hanging around. Could it be the omnipresent soulless entity the girls lovingly refer to as ""Mama""?—Nick Riganas After their father Jeffrey, partner in a brokerage firm, has a breakdown and kills co-workers and his estranged wife, he disappears with his two young daughters. The girls are found years later and adopted by their father's twin brother Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel, but a series of events lead the couple to suspect that the girls share ties to an evil spirit. A man kills several of his business partners and his estranged ex-wife, then runs away with his children: a young Victoria and baby Lilly. After speeding on a remote, snowy road, he crashes into the woods and takes the children to a nearby abandoned cabin he wanders upon. Realizing the mistakes he has made, he prepares to commit murder-suicide but at the last moment is killed by a strange figure in the cabin. Victoria looks at the figure but only sees a blur as her glasses were broken in the crash.Five years later, their Uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) have been madly searching for his brother and nieces using the inheritance of his brother. The searchers stumble upon the crashed car and find the two children in the cabin. In this time, they have become completely like animals, with Victoria physically shielding Lilly in a defensive stance to the intruders. They are put under the care of a psychiatrist, Dr. Dreyfuss. There is a legal dispute over custody of the children between Lucas and a rich aunt on the children's mother's side, while the court questions the ability of Lucas and Annabel to raise the children in a small apartment with little income given their special needs. Dr. Dreyfuss agrees to recommend Lucas and Annabel as the children's legal guardians as long as they agree to move into a special home used to perform case studies, knowing that he would not be able to monitor their progress if their aunt, who lives on the other side of the country, were to obtain custody.It quickly becomes apparent that the strange figure, whom the children repeatedly refer to as ""Mama"", is in the new home with the children. Her history is given throughout the movie through a combination of dreams Anabelle has (induced by Mama), research by Dr. Dreyfuss, and conversations with Victoria. ""Mama"" was a former patient at a mental asylum in the 1800s; her appearance and simple actions imply she had Down Syndrome, though this is never officially stated. She breaks out of the asylum and stabs a nun who had taken Mama's baby (also named Lily) into her care then steals the baby back. Chased by the authorities, she ends up at the edge of a cliff overlooking the lake; seeing no other path, she jumps and hits a tree branch on the way down. While Mama fell into the lake, the baby (killed by the impact) was stuck to the tree trunk and was recovered by the pursuers. Mama becomes a ghost, twisted by the sad emotions of not knowing where her child is (she is unaware of why the baby was not in the lake with her). This causes her to take a form of physically being twisted, with body parts askew and many joints bending the wrong way. She searched the woods for centuries trying to find her baby, until she stumbled upon Victoria and Lily about to be killed in the cabin, and began taking care of the children as her own.Mama's presence is generally signaled by black butterflies and electrical problems. She plays with the children but hides from sight of anyone else; Victoria always takes off her glasses when she looks at Mama and tells Dr. Dreyfuss she won't come where she can be seen. Early in the movie, Lucas is pushed down the stairs by Mama and ends up in a coma. This forces Annabel, who does not want the children, to take care of them. Over time, Victoria becomes more like a normal child, but Lilly retains her animal-like nature; this is attributed to the fact that Victoria was older and thus had socially developed before their abandonment in the woods. Over time, Annabel becomes attached to the children, and later, Victoria begins to prefer her over Mama, but Lilly still remains completely loyal to Mama. Annabel becomes aware there is something wrong and that Mama may indeed be real. Victoria worries for her safety, saying Mama gets very jealous.Dr. Dreyfuss begins to believe the stories of Mama, first because Victoria is able to tell stories with information she shouldn't be able to know, and later because he actually sees Mama. In the course of the investigation, he obtains custody of the corpse of Mama's baby. Dr. Dreyfuss comes to believe that Mama is located in the cabin in the woods and goes to investigate but is killed by Mama there. The aunt believes Annabel is abusing the children (due to bruises Lilly has from her animal-like tendencies) and begins to spy on the house for proof. Lucas has a dream induced by his dead brother while in a coma, asking him to save his children and pointing him to a location in the woods. Annabel visits Dr. Dreyfuss's office after another supernatural night at the house but finds out he is missing; she steals his objects related to the case. At this point, she learns of the aspects of the case which the doctor had found out about and finds the baby's corpse. At the same time, Mama becomes angry and attacks the children and Annabel; Victoria tries hard to defend Annabel and pleads for Mama to stop, but Lilly is still clearly loyal to Mama. Annabel is knocked out, but at the last moment the aunt breaks into the house and has her body possessed by Mama. Mama uses this body to take the children to the cabin.Annabel wakes up, grabs the baby's corpse, and drives to the lake, finding Lucas along the way, who has left the hospital and gone to the site his brother told him about in his coma dream. They arrive at the cabin, finding the aunt's corpse but neither Lilly nor Victoria. Annabel sees the cliff that Mama had originally jumped from; remembering the warning that ghosts are twisted souls doomed to repeat their mistakes, she realizes Mama's intentions to jump off the cliff with the children. Lucas and Annabel arrive in time to stop the children from jumping, but Mama attacks them. The assault is stopped when Mama finds her baby's corpse, begins crying, and prepares to jump off the cliff with it, her twisted appearance reverting to a more human one. However, as they are leaving, Lilly shouts to Mama and she regains her twisted appearance and attacks again, knocking out Lucas. She grabs the kids and walks to the edge of the cliff. Annabel tries desperately to stop Mama, eventually beaten to the point that she can only hold onto Victoria. Once at the edge of the cliff, Victoria tries to convince Lilly not to go, and Lilly cries that Lilly, Victoria, and Mama should all be together. Mama jumps off the cliff with just Lilly, and upon hitting the branch, Mama and Lilly turn into a shower of butterflies. The movie ends with Victoria realizing that one of the butterflies watching over her is in fact Lilly, perhaps referencing a ghostly regret of Victoria not going with her."

When they arrive, they find that Komarov, Irina, and Alik have already gotten there, but what they don't know is that on their way there, it was revealed that there was never a file in existence, and that the vault actually contains billions of dollars worth of weapons-grade uranium. Alik is then shot in the head by the seemingly helpless Komarov, who later called Chagarin and told him that he and Irina had manipulated the entire sequence of events since the beginning in an attempt to obtain the uranium and get revenge on Chagarin for his past betrayal of Komarov. Chagarin was then killed by a subordinate of Komarov's.At this point, John and Jack enter the vault, discover Komarov's true plot, and take him under arrest. Irina, with another henchman, comes to her father's aid, but before they can escape, Jack goes after Komarov, while John goes after Irina, who is escaping on a helicopter. Irina tries to protect her father by firing the helicopter's cannons at Jack, but John is able to bring the helicopter out of balance by driving a truck in the hangar section of the helicopter, still shackled by a rope, out of the open back door, muttering his catchphrase of ""Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker."" In rage, Jack hurls Komarov off the rooftop, and Komarov falls into the spinning helicopter's rotors and is killed. John jumps off the helicopter and reunites with Jack inside the building. Wanting to avenge her father, Irina rams the helicopter into the building, destroying the building and killing herself in the process, but John and Jack survive by leaping off the building into a large pool of water.Afterwards, John and Jack return to New York. At the airport, they meet Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), John's oldest child and Jack's sister, and the reunited family happily walks off together."

With much of the world's population now an undead horde, R is a young and oddly introspective zombie. While fighting with and feeding on a human scavenger party, R meets Julie and feels an urge to protect her. What happens next is the beginning of a strangely warm relationship that allows R to begin regaining his humanity. As this change spreads through the local undead population like a virus, Julie and R eventually have to face a larger issue when the very nature of their friendship is challenged. Caught between the paranoid human forces and the ferocious ""Bonies"", zombies who are a mutual threat, R and Julie must find a way to bridge the differences of each side to fight for a better world no one thought possible.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In a post-apocalyptic USA, the survivors live in a city surrounded by walls that separate them from the living dead.

But the fearful Bonies are seeking out Julie and R...—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A tormented zombie (Nicholas Hoult) experiences a profound transformation after entering into an unusual relationship with the daughter (Teresa Palmer) of a military leader charged with eradicating the walking dead. As the unlikely pair build a tenuous bridge between the living and the dead, those on both sides of the battle begin to sense that nothing in their world will ever be the same again. When a highly unusual zombie (Hoult) rescues a girl (Palmer) from imminent death at the hands of his cohorts, their unlikely romance sets in motion a chain of events that will transform him, his fellow dead, and maybe even the whole lifeless world. About eight years after a zombie apocalypse, R (Nicholas Hoult), a zombie, spends his days wandering around an airport which is now filled with hordes of his fellow Undead, including his best friend M (Rob Corddry). R and M achieve rudimentary communication with grunts and moans and occasional near-words. As a zombie, R constantly craves human flesh, especially brains, as he is able to ""feel alive"" through the victims' memories he experiences when he eats them.
Boneys are zombies when they lose all their flesh and are so deprived that they will eat anything even barely alive. They are much worse than Zombies.While R and a pack of zombies are out hunting for food, they encounter Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer) and a group of her friends, who were sent out by Julie's father (John Malkovich) from a heavily fortified, walled-off human enclave in a nearby city to recover medical supplies from abandoned buildings. R sees Julie and is drawn to her. After being shot in the chest by Julie's boyfriend, Perry (Dave Franco), R kills him while Julie is distracted, and eats his brain, giving R his thoughts and memories, making his attraction to Julie even stronger. He rescues Julie from the rest of the pack by wiping some zombie blood on her face, masking her scent, and takes her back to an airplane he resides in at the airport to keep her safe.Julie is initially terrified of R, and suspicious of his intentions. Julie starts to trust R after he rescues her during a failed escape attempt and finds her some food. R insists that Julie has to stay with him for a few days until he deems it safe enough for her to leave. The two bond, listening to LP records and playing games to kill the time, causing R to slowly begin to come to life. After a few days, Julie gets restless, and tries to return home, yet attracts swarms of zombies, requiring R to rescue her. After fending off a group of zombies, including M, who is confused by R's actions, R decides it is time to return her to the human enclave.On the way, R reveals to Julie that he was the one that killed Perry, which prompts her to abandon him and return to her home alone. R begins to make his way back to the airport, heartbroken. He then sees that M and other zombies are also beginning to show signs of life, making all of them targets for the Boneys - skeletal zombies who, having lost all traces of their humanity, have shed their flesh and prey on anything with a heartbeat. R and M lead a group to the human enclave, where R sneaks inside the wall.There, he finds Julie and meets her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), who is initially shocked. When R reveals that the other corpses have also been coming back to life, the three of them attempt to tell Colonel Grigio, Julie's father and leader of the survivors. Colonel Grigio refuses to believe corpses can change and threatens to kill R, stopping only when Nora pulls a gun on him. Julie and R escape to a baseball stadium where the rest of R's group is waiting, but soon find themselves under attack by a horde of Boneys.
While M and his gang of zombies square off against the Boneys, Julie and R run, but find themselves trapped.Taking the only escape route, R jumps with Julie into a pool far below, shielding her from the impact. After Julie pulls R from the bottom of the pool, they kiss. Colonel Grigio arrives and shoots R in the shoulder without warning. Julie attempts to persuade him that R has changed, when she notices that he is bleeding from his wound - revealing that he has completely revived and is human once more.The humans and zombies combine forces and kill most of the Boneys while the rest die off from starvation and the zombies slowly assimilate into human society.

Sent to the market by his uncle to sell their horse and buy thatch for their roof, Jack meets the beautiful Princess Isabelle, whom he rescues from ruffians. He returns home with only a handful of beans given to him by a monk who claimed they were sacred, but that does little to impress his uncle, who tosses them away.

And the giants devoured everyone so Erik the king had a crown made that makes whoever wears it control the giants and he used it to make them leave and he had the giant stalks chopped.

When they make it to the top they discover that the tale about the giants might not be a myth. Roderick also tells Jack to give him the beans.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Ever since they were children, Princess Isabelle of Cloister and a young farmer named Jack, one of the kingdom's subjects, have been fascinated by the tale of magic beans possessed by monks made to grow a pathway to find their God, only to find that pathway led to a place between heaven and Earth home to race of giants who had a taste for human flesh and bone. King Erik the Great, one of Isabelle's true ancestors, had fashioned a magic gold crown to rule and thus control the giants, who he banished back to their prison between heaven and Earth, with the pathway destroyed for them never to return. So when Jack is offered a bag of beans by a monk as collateral payment for Jack's horse, Jack is forced to take the beans as the monk absconds with his horse. In Jack's presence, one of the stray beans sprouts, sweeping Isabelle up into the sky with the giant beanstalk. Isabelle had always wanted adventure outside the castle walls, this adventure is arguably too much even for her. King Brahmwell issues his head guardian, Elmont, to assemble a party of men to search for Isabelle. Two volunteers for the party are Lord Roderick, Isabelle's betrothed, one of the King's trusted advisors but a man she does not love, and Jack himself, the latter who is allowed to go as he saw what happened. What the King, the Lord and Elmont do not know is that Jack is in love with Isabelle from their two chance encounters and will do anything to save her. And what the King, Elmont and Jack do not know is that the Lord originally stole the beans and King Erik's crown from the monks, he, believing in the tale of the giants, planning on using them - the crown which he still possesses - and his marriage to Isabelle to rule Cloister with a heavy hand. They will all soon discover that the legend of the giants is true, the giants who have captured Isabelle. What they all also do not anticipate is that if they can make their way up the beanstalk to the giants, the giants can make their way down to Cloister. What happens between them all is largely dependent on who is in possession of King Erik's crown.—Huggo When Jack (Nicholas Hoult) inadvertently opens a passageway that allows giants to cross into our reality, the towering titans stake their claim on the world of humans. Should they succeed, Jack's kingdom will be but the first of many to fall. Now, in order to save his people and rescue a noble princess, Jack must summon every ounce of bravery to drive out the invading giants.. In the Kingdom of Cloister, Jack, a young farm boy, is fascinated by the legend of Erik, an ancient king who defeated an army of invading giants from a realm in the sky by controlling them with a magical crown. At the same time, Princess Isabelle becomes fascinated with the same legend.Ten years later, Jack goes into town to sell his horse to support his uncle's farm. There, Jack spots Isabelle and develops a crush on her, after defending her honor from a group of thugs. Meanwhile, Lord Roderick returns to his study, only to find that a monk has robbed him. The monk offers Jack some magic beans he stole from Roderick as collateral for Jack's horse. Back at the castle, Isabelle quarrels with her father, King Brahmwell, as she wants to explore the kingdom, but he wants her to stay and marry Roderick. Likewise, Jack's uncle scolds him for being foolish before throwing the beans on the floor and leaving the house.Determined to be free, Isabelle sneaks out of the castle and seeks shelter from the rain in Jack's house. As it rains, one of the beans takes root and grows into a massive beanstalk that carries the house and Isabelle into the sky as Jack falls to the ground.Jack, Roderick, and Roderick's attendant, Wicke, volunteer to join the king's knights, led by Elmont and his second in-command, Crawe, and climb the beanstalk in search of Isabelle. As they climb, Roderick and Wicke cut the safety rope, intentionally killing some of the knights. At the top, they discover the giants' realm and decide to split into two groups; one with Jack, Elmont, and Crawe, and the other including Roderick and Wicke, but not before Roderick forcibly takes the remaining beans from Jack (although Jack manages to save one for himself).Jack's group is trapped by a giant, who takes everyone prisoner except Jack. Meanwhile, Roderick's group encounters two other giants; one eats Wicke, but before they can do the same to Roderick, Roderick dons the magic crown.Jack follows the giant to their stronghold, where the two-headed giant leader, Fallon, has killed Crawe. There, Jack finds the imprisoned Isabelle and Elmont. As the giants prepare to kill their remaining prisoners, Roderick walks in and enslaves the giants with the crown. He tells the giants they will attack Cloister at dawn and allows them to eat Isabelle and Elmont. Jack rescues Isabelle and Elmont as one of the giants prepares to cook Elmont as a pig-in-a-blanket. The trio makes for the beanstalk, where Jack causes the giant guarding the beanstalk to fall off the realm's edge. Seeing the giant's body, Brahmwell orders the beanstalk cut down to avoid an invasion by the giants.Jack and Isabelle head down the beanstalk, while Elmont stays to confront Roderick. Elmont kills Roderick, but Fallon takes the crown before Elmont can claim it, and Elmont is forced to escape down the beanstalk. Jack, Isabelle, and Elmont all survive the fall after the beanstalk is cut down. As everyone returns home, Jack warns that the giants are using Roderick's beans to create beanstalks to descend down to Earth and attack Cloister.The giants chase Jack, Isabelle, and Brahmwell into the castle, where Elmont fills the moat with oil and sets it on fire. Fallon falls in the moat and breaks into the castle from below. As the siege continues, Fallon captures Jack and Isabelle, but Jack throws the final bean down Fallon's throat, causing a beanstalk to rip apart his body. Jack takes the crown and sends the giants back to their realm.Jack and Isabelle marry and tell the story of the giants to their children. As time passes, the magic crown is crafted into St Edward's Crown and is secured in the Tower of London."
The Purge,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2184339/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A wealthy family is held hostage for harboring the target of a murderous syndicate during the Purge, a 12-hour period in which any and all crime is legal. In an America wracked by crime and overcrowded prisons, the government has sanctioned an annual 12-hour period in which any and all criminal activity-including murder-becomes legal. The police can't be called. Hospitals suspend help. It's one night when the citizenry regulates itself without thought of punishment. On this night plagued by violence and an epidemic of crime, one family wrestles with the decision of who they will become when a stranger comes knocking. When an intruder breaks into James Sandin's (Ethan Hawke) gated community during the yearly lockdown, he begins a sequence of events that threatens to tear a family apart. Now, it is up to James, his wife, Mary (Lena Headey), and their kids to make it through the night without turning into the monsters from whom they hide.—Universal Pictures In 2022, the United States of America celebrates once a year ""The Purge"", a 12-hour period when any crime is allowed including murder. The result is economical growth and a society free of homeless, sick and unproductive persons. James Sandin is a successful salesman that sells security systems for houses. He lives with his wife Mary and his teenage son Charlie and daughter Zoey in a fancy house in the suburb. During the purge, James seals his house and plans to watch a movie with his family. However, Charlie sees a stranger fleeing from a group that is hunting him down and he disarms the security device and lets the man in. But the leader of the group gives an ultimatum to James: if he does not deliver the man to the group, they would kill the whole family. Now James has to find where the man is hidden and decide his fate.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil By 2022, an American governmental decision has been made, which says that all kinds of crimes including murders are legal for a period of 12 hours yearly. The aim of it is to let people get rid of their hatred by legalizing crimes, and then to decrease the rate of crime in the rest of the year, and to maintain a high economic level in US by taking out poor people lives and to give the priority for the high-class people to live.—om-ar-461-25129 In the not-too-distant future, rampant crime and prison overcrowding have inspired the U.S. government to implement a unique solution to restore the peace: Each year, for a 12-hour period, any and all crime becomes permissible as police put their jobs on hold, and hospitals close their doors. It's called the Purge, and remarkably, the annual event leads to drastically reduced crime and record-low unemployment levels throughout the rest of the year. But this year, as suburban parents James (Ethan Hawke) and Mary (Lena Headey) place their home on lock-down for the annual event, a desperate man finds his way into their neighborhood while fleeing a sadistic gang of masked killers. In a moment of compassion, James and Mary's adolescent son (Max Burkholder) unlocks the door, offering sanctuary to the frightened stranger. Unfortunately for the entire family, that act of kindness may also be their very last, because now the killers who were pursuing the man have surrounded the house, and have vowed to kill everyone inside unless they are willingly given the man they are hunting within an hour. As the clock begins to tick, the family face a difficult dilemma -- do they sacrifice the life of a stranger in hopes of saving themselves, or attempt to stand their ground until the Purge expires?. In 2022, the United States is a nation reborn ruled by the ""New Founding Fathers of America."" To maintain low crime and unemployment rates throughout the year, the government has instituted an annual 12-hour period called ""The Purge"" during which all criminal activity (including murder, theft, rape, etc.) becomes legal. The only rules during The Purge are that ""Level 10"" government officials must remain unharmed and usage of weaponry above ""Class 4"" is forbidden. The Purge is designed to act as a catharsis for the American people, so that they may vent all negative emotions however they desire.James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is a wealthy salesman who has made a fortune selling home security systems comprising security cameras and metallic walls preventing any possible entrance that are specifically designed for The Purge. One of the neighbors, Grace, tells James's wife Mary (Lena Headey) the neighbors have been gossiping that the extension on the Sandins' house was financed by the security systems James sold them.At their heavily-fortified house, Mary struggles with their two children, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder). Zoey is dating an older boy named Henry (Tony Oller) whom Zoey's father doesn't approve of. Zoey goes to her bedroom, where she finds Henry, who snuck into the house before the lockdown. Henry explains to Zoey he wants to convince James to bless their relationship and figured he could not be thrown out of the house during The Purge.The Purge commences after an emergency broadcast on television. James and his family watch the events of The Purge unfold via the video monitors in the lounge. After a while, Charlie is left alone in the lounge and notices a bloody stranger (Edwin Hodge), outside the house pleading for help. Charlie deactivates the security system and lets him in. James intercepts the stranger and holds him at gunpoint.Henry appears and opens fire on James, attempting to eliminate the obstacle preventing his relationship with Zoey. James fatally shoots Henry, and in the confusion the stranger escapes to hide within the house. Zoey runs off with the fatally-wounded Henry and watches him die. James then goes off in search of his daughter and the stranger.Later, a group of masked ""Purgers"" led by a character known as ""Polite Leader"" (Rhys Wakefield) arrive at their home, having found where the bloody stranger is hiding. The leader suggests that the family give them the stranger or else they'll kill everyone inside. James admits that the security system was designed to act as a deterrent, but not to withstand any number of types of aggressive assaults.Charlie finds the stranger and leads him to a secret hiding place. Zoey, seeking to also hide there, inadvertently stumbles into the stranger, who holds her at gunpoint but James pounds a vase on the stranger's head. James and Mary tie up the stranger and, to subdue him, aggravate his wounds, in preparation to deliver him to the attackers.After seeing James with Zoey, the Bloody Stranger sadly tells James to take him outside. However, the Sandins have a change of heart after realizing they are becoming essentially no different than the purgers outside. The purgers successfully break into the household and the Sandins are forced to defend themselves. One by one, James kills the purgers, but James is stabbed by the leader. Zoey, standing on the staircase, shoots and kills the leader.Suddenly, the Sandins' neighbors arrive and finish off the remaining purgers. Mary thanks them, but the neighbors reveal that they have come to kill the Sandins: since the opportunity presented itself, they decided it was their patriotic duty to kill the Sandins in order to vent their hatred for the family's new-found wealth. Just as the neighbors are about to kill the family, the Bloody Stranger comes to the Sandins' aid. He kills Mr. Cali (Tom Yi) with his handgun and threatens to kill the remaining neighbors if they don't let the Sandins go, which they do.Mary decides to spare her neighbors, as too many people have died during the night and to not allow them the pleasure of not having to live with the Sandins. Grace tries to grab Mary's gun to shoot her, but Mary deflects the attack and hits Grace with the butt of her gun and smashes her face into a glass table. The surviving neighbors and the stranger leave the house and walk away as sirens outside start blaring again, signaling the end of the Purge. The Sandin family watches the emergency services arrive outside their home.During the credits, there is audio from television broadcasts stating that this Purge was the most successful due to the record high number of murders. The broadcast also features analysis and interviews that show growing discontent and shock by the American public at the increasing level of depravity with each subsequent Purge. Despite this, the Purge will recur as normal next year."

Having been brought in to being by loving parents who gained permission for his birth, Ender feels he is not only unwanted but excess baggage to the world. However, his mind is his strength. He is gifted with the ability to become his aggressor and think like his aggressor thus giving him the key to the aggressor as he learns to love them through their frailty - using this to exploit them and thus destroy them. This ability is seen by those old men solidified in their ways, who have no flexibility in their thinking anymore, and exploit Ender to achieve their own ends. But at what cost, and to whom?—BlueEyes001 In the near future, humanity is preparing to launch an attack on the homeworld of an alien race called the Formics who had attacked Earth and killed millions; the Formic invasion was stopped by Mazer Rackham, who crashed his F-35 Lightning II into a Formic queen ship at the apparent cost of his life. Over the course of 50 years, gifted children are trained by the International Fleet to become commanders of a new fleet for this counter-attack.12-year-old Cadet Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) draws the attention of Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) by his aptitude in simulated space combat. They order the removal of his monitor, signifying the end of the cadet program. Ender is attacked by Stilson, a bully student he defeated in the combat sim, but Ender fights back and severely injures him. Ender confesses his grief to his older sister Valentine, but is harassed further by their older brother Peter. That evening while the family is having dinner, Graff arrives to reveal he was being tested and is still part of the program. Graff brings Ender to Battle School, an orbiting space station in Earth's orbit, placing Ender with other cadets his age, but treats him as extraordinary, ostracizing him from the others.Among other studies, the cadets are placed in squads and perform training games in a zero gravity ""Battle Room"". Ender quickly adapts to the games, devising new strategies older students have not yet seen. Graff reassigns Ender to Salamander Army, led by Commander Bonzo Madrid, a short, bitter, but intimidating squad leader. Bonzo, believing that Ender is inept due to his size, prevents him from training with the rest of the squad. Another cadet, Petra Arkanian, takes Ender and trains him privately. While Bonzo is aware of this, he does not take any action against Petra. In one match, Bonzo orders Ender to stay behind while the rest of the Salamander Army fights another team; however, seeing Petra in trouble, Ender comes to her aid and helps the Salamander Army win. After the match, Bonzo is humiliated by the other students and threatens Ender if he embarrasses him again.Meanwhile, Ender plays a computerized ""mind game"" set in a fantasy world aimed to present difficult choices to the player. In one situation, Ender creates an outside the box solution to overcome a seemingly unsolvable problem. Later, he encounters a Formic in the game, and then a simulated image of Valentine entering the ruins of a castle. Inside, he finds another image of Valentine but as he nears, it turns into an image of Peter before the game ends.Graff promotes Ender to his own squad, made from other students that have gained Ender's trust. They are put in increasingly difficult battles. In one match against two other teams including Bonzo's squad, Ender devises a novel strategy of sacrificing part of his team to achieve a goal, impressing Graff. Bonzo accosts Ender in the bathroom after the match, but Ender fights back and Bonzo falls during the struggle, seriously injured. Distraught over this, Ender prepares to quit Battle School, but Graff has Valentine speak to him and convince him to continue.Graff takes Ender to humanity's forward base on a former Formic planet near their homeworld. There, Ender meets Rackham, who explains how he spotted the shared-mind nature of the Formics to stop the attack fifty years prior. Ender finds that his former squad members are also here to help him train in computerized simulations of large fleet combat; Rackham puts special emphasis on the fleet's Molecular Detachment (MD) Device that is capable of disintegrating matter. Ender's training is rigorous and Anderson expresses concern they are pushing Ender too fast, but Graff notes they have run out of time to replace Ender.Ender's final test is monitored by several of the fleet commanders. As the simulation starts, Ender finds his fleet over the Formic homeworld and vastly outnumbered. He orders most of his fleet to sacrifice themselves to protect the MD long enough to fire on the homeworld. The resulting chain reaction burns over the surface of the planet, killing the entire population. The simulation ends, and Ender believes the test is over, but the commanders restart the video screens, showing that the destruction of the Formic homeworld was real and Ender had been controlling the real fleet this time. Despite Graff's assurance he will be known as a hero, Ender is furious as he feels responsible for the annihilation and that everyone will remember him as a killer.As Ender struggles with his emotions, he recognizes one of the Formic structures nearby similar to the ruined castle from the game, and believing they were trying to communicate with him, races out towards it. He follows the path set by the game, and encounters a dying Formic queen. The Queen acknowledges Ender's role in the genocide of their race, but that he simply wanted peace in the long term and forgives him. The Queen later gives Ender a queen egg that it had been protecting.After the war, Ender is promoted to Admiral, given a small ship, and left to his own devices. In a letter to Valentine, he tells her that he is going into deep space, determined to form a new Formic colony with the queen egg."

While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In a town in northeastern Pennsylvania, Keller and Grace Dover, Franklin and Nancy Birch, and their respective offspring - each couple with a teenager and adolescent apiece - are best friends. While the two families are celebrating Thanksgiving together, the two adolescent girls, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, go missing. Based on events earlier in the day, the two families believe that the girls were abducted by whoever lives in the camper van parked in their neighborhood. Their beliefs are strengthened after they meet the resident of the camper, Alex Jones, a mentally childlike young man who is supported in every respect by his overprotective aunt, Holly Jones, and based on other subsequent evidence about Alex that emerges. However, Detective Loki, the lead police investigator, is pretty certain that Alex did not abduct the girls, he instead initially following leads of known sex offenders and pedophiles in the area. In addition, Loki has no evidence to hold Alex in custody, placing him at odds especially with Keller, who is certain that Alex is the one who abducted the girls.

He has to decide how much he will involve Grace, Franklin and Nancy in getting Alex to divulge where the girls are by any means possible.

After Earth,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1815862/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A crash landing leaves Kitai Raige and his father Cypher stranded on Earth, a millennium after events forced humanity's escape. With Cypher injured, Kitai must embark on a perilous journey to signal for help. One thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity's escape from Earth, Nova Prime has become mankind's new home. Legendary General Cypher Raige returns from an extended tour of duty to his estranged family, ready to be a father to his 13-year-old son, Kitai. When an asteroid storm damages Cypher and Kitai's craft, they crash-land on a now unfamiliar and dangerous Earth. As his father lies dying in the cockpit, Kitai must trek across the hostile terrain to recover their rescue beacon. His whole life, Kitai has wanted nothing more than to be a soldier like his father. Today, he gets his chance.—Columbia Pictures Kitai, a hopeful teenage ranger, is eager to follow in his dad's footsteps. After all, his father is Cypher Raige, a battle-hardened general. But they say be careful what you wish for. When an unforeseen catastrophe during a routine space voyage traps them in a hostile alien environment, Kitai must put his rigorous training to good use to save the day. However, nearly one hundred kilometres of arduous trek brimming with formidable adversaries and ferocious apex predators separate the ill-fated survivors from a faint hope of success. And the question remains. Can Kitai live up to his father's expectations and live to tell the tale?—Nick Riganas In the near future, an environmental cataclysm forces the human race to abandon Earth and venture beyond the Solar System in search of a new home. The exodus ends when humanity settles a new pristine world they call Nova Prime.One thousand years later, The Ranger Corps, a peacekeeping organization commanded by General Cypher Raige (Will Smith), comes into conflict with the S'krell, alien creatures that intended to conquer Nova Prime. Their secret weapon are the Ursas, large predatory creatures that hunt by 'sensing' fear. The Rangers struggle against the Ursas until Cypher learns how to completely suppress his fear, a technique called ""ghosting"". After teaching this technique to the other Rangers, he leads the Ranger Corps to victory.Meanwhile, Cypher's son, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith), blames himself for the death of his sister, Senshi (Zoë Kravitz), at the hands of an Ursa. Not wanting to fail his father again because of her death, Kitai trains hard to become a Ranger just like Cypher. His application for the Ranger Corps is rejected due to his recklessness, and Cypher views him as a disappointment. Kitai's mother, Faia (Sophie Okonedo), convinces Cypher to take Kitai on his last voyage before retirement.Forced together by the mission, father and son start to bond during the trip. However, their spaceship is caught by an asteroid shower forcing them to crash-land on Earth, now a Class-1 quarantined planet. Both of Cypher's legs are broken, and the main emergency beacon has been damaged. Cypher instructs Kitai to locate the tail section of the ship which broke off during the plunge to the surface. Inside is the backup beacon which they can use to signal Nova Prime. Kitai is given Cypher's Ranger weapon, a wrist communicator and six oxygen capsules so he can breathe, since human lungs can no longer tolerate Earth's air. Cypher warns him to avoid the fauna and flora, which has mutated since humans left, and be careful with the planet's thermal shifts. Kitai sets off to find the tail section, with Cypher guiding him through the communicator.Kitai is soon attacked by giant baboons and ends up being bitten by a poisonous leech after going against Cypher's orders in an attempt to escape. Although Kitai successfully administers an antidote, two of his oxygen capsules are damaged, and his nervous system shuts down for hours. When Kitai awakens, he narrowly escapes one of the planet's thermal shifts, and upon discovery of his damaged capsules, lies to Cypher. That night, Kitai listens to Cypher tell him a story of when he was attacked by an Ursa, how he realized that fear is merely an illusion created by the mind's thoughts of the future, and thus he first began to ""ghost"" himself from the Ursas, choosing to live rather than to let his enemy, both fear and the Ursas, decide his fate.The following day, Kitai reaches a mountaintop, and Cypher learns about Kitai's broken oxygen capsules. Concluding that Kitai won't have enough oxygen, orders him to abort the mission. Believing his father still sees him as a disappointment, Kitai blames Senshi's death on Cypher, who was away from Nova Prime the day they were attacked. Determined to prove his father wrong, Kitai skydives from the mountaintop, but is captured by a massive condor which damages his forewam/wrist communicator in the process.The condor takes a liking to Kitai, who is forced to flee when the condor's nest is attacked by lions. Using a makeshift raft he continues his trek, during which Kitai has a dream about his sister. Senshi reassures him that Cypher's bitterness is just his own anger for not saving her. When Kitai wakes, he is surprised by another thermal shift, loses Cypher's weapon and nearly freezes to death. Fortunately, Kitai is rescued by the condor, that sacrifices itself for him.Kitai reaches the tail section and retrieves the emergency beacon along with another communicator, another weapon and more oxygen capsules. The communicator only allows Cypher to hear and see Kitai, but not for Kitai to hear him. Kitai is shocked to learn the ship was carrying an Ursa meant to teach the cadets how to ""ghost"" themselves. The creature has escaped in the crash and killed the remnants of the crew. When the emergency beacon does not activate, Cypher realizes that the atmosphere is blocking the signal, and that Kitai must get to higher ground. Kitai heads to a nearby volcano from which he can launch the beacon, where he is attacked by the Ursa and injured. However, remembering both Cypher's instructions, focusing on the moment rather than the outcome, and the words of encouragement Senshi whispered in his dream, Kitai is able to control his fear and ""ghost"" himself from the Ursa enough to kill it with his weapon. Kitai then launches the beacon and a rescue mission soon arrives to return them to Nova Prime.Cypher recovers from his injuries and salutes Kitai for his bravery"
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When both he and a colleague are about to lose their job, Walter takes action by embarking on an adventure more extraordinary than anything he ever imagined. The manager of the negative-assets sector of Life magazine, Walter Mitty, has been working for 16 years for the magazine and has a tedious life, not going anywhere but to and from work. He is an escapist, daydreaming into a fantasy world many times a day. Walter has a crush on recently-hired Cheryl Melhoff but he is too shy to invite her out and he is trying to contact her via online dating. The magazine is preparing to release its last printed edition and the loathsome manager of transition Ted Hendricks is preparing an inevitable downsizing over the next few days. Walter has been the liaison between the magazine and the mysterious independent photographer Sean O'Connell, who has sent to him a package of negatives and a wallet as a gift for his work. Sean also suggests to the senior management the use of negative 25 for the cover of the last edition. However, Walter cannot find the missing negative. Walter has no means to contact Sean and finds a clue that he might be in Greenland. He decides to travel to Greenland to track Sean down in the beginning of an unbelievable adventure.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In this comedic adaptation of James Thurber's short story, Ben Stiller stars as Walter, a milquetoast proofreader for a magazine-publishing firm. Walter is constitutionally incapable of standing up for himself, so he retreats into his fantasy world, where he is heroic, poised, self-assured, and the master of his fate.. All good things must come to an end, and, sadly--as the popular American magazine, Life, ceases publication to focus exclusively on the online market--suddenly, quiet daydreamer and the organisation's negative-asset manager, Walter Mitty, faces unemployment. To make matters worse, for the final print issue's cover image, the famed globe-trotting photographer, Sean O'Connell, entrusts Mitty with the epitome of his life's work captured in a single frame that is, however, nowhere to be found. As a result, the mousy and utterly unadventurous Walter must step out of his comfort zone to venture into the unknown at the edge of the world, trying to save what's left of his reputation; nevertheless, is he prepared to live up to the company's inspiring motto? Above all, life is a gift. What was captured inside Sean's quintessential but missing photograph?—Nick Riganas Unhappy with the dull, lonely direction his life has taken, socially-awkward Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has a chance to change that when he's tasked with finding a missing photo that could save his company from being downsized. In a wild and unexpected turn of events, Walter's adventure takes him to all corners of the world as he attempts to track down the mysterious, elusive photographer who took the photo.—geometrydashbroham Walter Mitty is a negative assets manager at 'Life' magazine who daydreams of adventures to get away out of the tedium of his boring job. Mitty also has a crush on a co-worker named Cheryl, but never has the nerve to tell her his feelings towards her. Mitty works with photojournalist Sean O'Connell, whose images are highly regarded. O'Connell has sent Mitty his latest negatives and a wallet as a gift in appreciation of Mitty's work. O'Connell believes negative #25 captures the ""quintessence"" of Life and that it should be used for the cover of the magazine's final print issue as it converts to online status. The negative is missing, however, and Walter is forced to stall for time with corporate transition manager Ted Hendricks, who is handling the downsizing. While viewing the other negatives outside Life's offices, Cheryl approaches Mitty and suggests that he think of the negatives as clues to Sean's location. They look at three of them, including one of a person's thumb with a unique ring on it, and another of a curved piece of wood. A third picture of a boat leads Mitty to determine that O'Connell is in Greenland. Mitty promptly flies there to find him.After arriving in the Greenland capital city of Nuuk, Mitty meets with a local bartender who explains that O'Connell left on a ship. To find him, Mitty would need to go on the postal helicopter that delivers mail to the various towns and outposts along the coast, and the pilot is drunk. Mitty recognizes the pilot's thumb with the unique ring and realizes he is on the right track. He at first declines to fly with the intoxicated pilot, but imagines Cheryl singing ""Space Oddity"", gains a new confidence and boards the helicopter. Nearing the ship, Mitty learns the helicopter cannot land upon it. Misunderstanding the pilot, instead of jumping into a dinghy boat nearing to catch him, Mitty aims for the main vessel and misses and falls in the ocean. He splashes down into ice-cold, shark-infested waters, losing a box of ship-to-shore radio components before being brought aboard.Mitty learns that O'Connell departed the ship earlier. The crew offers him some clementine cake O'Connell left behind; Mitty discovers O'Connell's destinations in the wrapping paper. The itinerary directs Mitty to Iceland, where O'Connell is photographing the volcano Eyjafjallajökull, and he arrives at the local village of Skógar near the volcano using a longboard, and notices O'Connell on the plane flying near the volcano. An eruption forces Mitty to flee, and as there is nothing left for him to do, he obeys a text message recalling him to New York.For failing to recover the negative, his first failure in a long career with the magazine, Mitty is fired by Hendricks. He learns that Cheryl, who was let go earlier, seems to have reconciled with her estranged husband. Mitty returns home discouraged and visits his mother, throwing away the wallet he received from O'Connell. To his surprise, Mitty recognizes the curve of the piano in his mother's house while looking at the last photograph. When asked, Mitty's mom mentions having met O'Connell. She had told Mitty before but he was daydreaming and failed to hear her.Mitty discovers O'Connell is in the Himalayas, and finds him photographing a rare snow leopard. When asked about the negative, O'Connell explains that the message on the gift wrapping to ""look inside"" was literal; the negative was in the wallet. Unfortunately, Mitty had interpreted this message as a direction to look inside the tissue paper in the box containing the wallet, and it could also be interpreted as referring to the inscription stamped into the leather inside the wallet. When pressed to reveal the image on the negative, O'Connell dismisses the question and joins in a high-altitude football game with some locals. Mitty flies to Los Angeles but is detained by airport security during a misunderstanding (mainly stemming from his having traveled through Yemen to Afghanistan). Mitty calls the only person he knows in Los Angeles: Todd Maher, a representative at eHarmony who has kept in contact during Mitty's adventures.While helping his mother sell her piano, Mitty recounts his story but mentions he does not have the wallet anymore. His mother says she always keeps his knickknacks and gives him the wallet that she retrieved from the trash. Finding inside the wallet a small manila envelope the size of a single-frame 35mm negative, an emboldened Mitty delivers it to Life magazine, tells management that it was the photograph O'Connell wanted for the final issue, and berates Hendricks for disrespecting the staff that made the magazine so honored before walking away from the office, humiliating him in front of his recently hired staff.Mitty reunites with Cheryl, emboldens himself enough to tell her outright that he has been thinking about and inspired by her, and learns that Cheryl's ex-husband was only at her house to repair the refrigerator. Mitty tells Cheryl of his adventures and admits that he still does not know what negative #25 shows. Mitty and Cheryl see the final issue of Life at a newsstand, with its cover dedicated to the staff. It is accompanied by the photograph from negative #25, showing Mitty sitting outside of the Life building, examining a contact sheet. Mitty and Cheryl continue their walk down the street holding hands."
12 Years a Slave,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the antebellum United States,Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Based on an incredible true story of one man's fight for survival and freedom. In the pre-Civil War United States,Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty personified by a malevolent slave owner, as well as unexpected kindnesses, Solomon struggles not only to stay alive, but to retain his dignity. In the twelfth year of his unforgettable odyssey, Solomon's chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist will forever alter his life.—Fox Searchlight Saratoga Springs, New York, 1841.Solomon Northup, the free-born African-American son of a freed slave, finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Abducted and sold into slavery, Solomon ends up in the sugarcane and cotton plantations of antebellum Louisiana, doomed to work his fingers to the bone away from his wife and two kids. Sold to the highest bidder, Northup adopts a new identity and does everything he can to survive a succession of hardened deep-South enslavers bent on breaking his spirit. But as the weeks turn into years, a ray of hope shines in the shape of a benevolent abolitionist who crosses paths with the forsaken captive. And after twelve cruel years of soul-crushing slavery, Solomon finally sees his family again.—Nick Riganas The movie opens with a group of slaves receiving instruction on cutting sugar cane. A man sits languidly atop a wagon of the raw cane root, idly looking at the labor of the men. The scene shifts to a group of shacks. The slaves are eating. Solomon Northup notices the dark juice of blackberries and is inspired to create ink and a quill. Unfortunately, the scheme fails. The juice is too thin. Later, in the crowded slave quarters, a female stirs in her sleep and advances on Northup sexually, using his hand for release. Solomon flashes back to happier times with his wife and children and the title card flashes.
We see snippets of Solomon's life as a free man. He plays the violin exquisitely and is much in demand as a performer in his home of Saratoga. Later that night, after settling the children in their beds, he talks with his wife, who will shortly take the children with her as she works as a cook. He playfully expresses jealousy at being deprived of her cooking. The following morning he sees them off in a carriage. Later that afternoon, he encounters a friend who introduces him to two travelers (Brown and Hamilton) claiming to work with a circus-like show. They promise him an outrageous sum to accompany them to Washington DC and promise his return before his wife gets back. He agrees to join them.
We next see the trio at a restaurant in DC. His patrons plunk down a bag of coins in excess of their promised sum. They share wine and one of them watches closely as Solomon drains his glass. Everyone is having a great time. Suddenly, Solomon awakes in a dank cell, chained to the floor. In a series of flashbacks, we see his ""friends"" carry him up to his hotel room, excusing his drunken stupor to other patrons. Brown urges Hamilton that time is short, and they need to be done with it. Their departure ends the flashback, and we rejoin Solomon in the cell where he is told that he is a runaway Georgia slave. Despite his protests of being a free man, he has no papers. Solomon is mercilessly beaten and eventually sent into a slave pen with others.He discusses his situation with Clemens, an apparently educated slave who advises him on the dire nature of their situation. Soon a mother (Eliza) and daughter are brought to the pen to join a previously captured son. She tries to keep a brave face while understanding the forthcoming tragedy. Under cover of darkness, they are pulled from their cell, chained and transported to a river boat. They are led to the hold, crammed with other human cargo. Clemens reiterates his advice that Solomon maintain a low profile, denying his ability to read and write. The encounter another slave (Robert) who wants to revolt and take over the ship. They contemplate their odds before opting for caution.
Later that night, a slaver visits the hold and awakens Eliza to rape her. Robert attempts to stop the rape but is stabbed and killed. Clemens and Solomon are charged with dropping the body in the river, prompting Clemens to remark that Robert is better off in death. Later, they arrive at a dock. Clemens's master is waiting for them and immediately demands the return of his stolen property. Clemens gratefully scampers down into the embrace of his master, abandoning all evidence of his previously displayed intellect. Solomon has lost his only friend. After disembarking, a slaver (ironically named Freeman) calls his new property to their feet by announcing their names. He calls Solomon ""Platt"" which he obviously doesn't recognize. Solomon is slapped for denying the name.The indignity of Freeman's slave operation is displayed as the naked slaves bath in buckets at his offices. Inside, he puts on his sales spiel to eager customers. A genteel plantation owner (Ford), expresses interest in Platt (Solomon) and Eliza. She begs him to take her children as well, but Freeman balks, swiftly selling her son to another buyer. Ford attempts to buy her daughter (clearly of mixed heritage), but again Freeman won't adjust his price. Ford can only afford to pay for the two. Eliza is distraught and wildly screams in her grief, upsetting the sale. Solomon is commanded to play the fiddle to lighten the mood.
Ford transports his purchases back to his plantation. Eliza has been sobbing the whole trip. Ford's wife mentions that food and a night's rest will help her forget them. The next morning, the slaves are introduced to Tibeats, a slave handler, and Ford's overseer, Chapin. TIbeats sings a derisive song warning the slaves against escape as they perform their labor. They continue chopping timber and ultimately encounter a small band of native people with whom they share a brief respite. Solomon notices a stringed instrument and appears to remember his own violin.The next day, Solomon (against Clemens advice) approaches Ford with a novel idea to transport the lumber via the river. Tibeats is extremely patronizing, but Ford is impressed with Solomon's opinions and is persuaded. The scheme succeeds, and Tibeats is embarrassed. Ford offers Solomon a violin to play as a reward. Back at the slave quarters Eliza is moaning in sadness over the loss of her children. Solomon is frustrated by the noise and debates her about surviving under Ford's ""decent"" treatment. Eliza argues back that Ford must surely realize that Solomon is not a slave, yet does nothing to free him. Solomon is given pause. Eliza is eventually sold off as Ford's wife can't ""bear the noise.""
Over the next few days, Tibeats attempts to wreak petty vengeance on Solomon, leading to a verbal confrontation. Tibeats attempts to beat Solomon who fights back and gets the better of him. Chapin comes upon the scene and sends Tibeats scurrying. He warns him that he cannot protect him if he runs and implies that he will get Ford to straighten it out. Later, we find that Tibeats has gathered some thugs to lynch Solomon for daring to fight him. They have the noose around his neck and are preparing to hang him when Chapin returns, guns drawn.
He chases them off, but allows Solomon to hang there, barely able to support his weight, on tip toes (punishment for striking a white man). Gradually, slaves emerge from their cabins and appear to take no notice of his plight. A woman furtively brings him some water, but quickly retreats. What appears to be hours later, Ford finally returns and slices the rope, saving Solomon. He drags him into the house for protection, but decides that he must be sold. Tibeats will not be denied his vengeance. It is here that we learn Ford has sold Solomon to a notorious plantation owner named Epps, who is known for merciless beatings.
Epps reads a Bible passage, slanting the scripture to reinforce his ownership of the slaves. The next day brings a day of picking cotton. At the end of the day, the weight of each worker's bundles are marked. Solomon's yield is less than average. Slaves that picked less than the previous day receive lashes. Meanwhile, Patsey exceeds the best production of any worker by nearly double. Epps lingers around Patsey and offers extensive praise for her. It is clear he is fascinated by her, and his wife is none too pleased. Epps enters the slave quarters and rouses them from sleep, creating an impromptu dance where Patsey is the center of attention. Epps wife throws a heavy crystal decanter at Patsey's face, brutally scarring her. She demands that Epps sell Patsey, but he claims that he would send his wife away before losing Patsey.Mistress Epps sends Solomon on an errand to the store. She hands him a list and notices him reading it. She makes it clear that he should not do it again. On his way to the store, Solomon is inspired to attempt escape, but stumbles into a lynching. Seeing the fate of the two men, his spirit is broken, and he continues to the store. Seeing the paper, he develops the idea to take a spare sheet each time so that he might craft a letter. Some time later, Epps dispatches Solomon to a nearby plantation owned by Shaw. Shaw has married one of his slaves and elevated her status (at least on his plantation). Patsey is there for a visit, enjoying the finery, but apparently Epps is jealous that Shaw might attempt to bed her. After a brief refreshment, Solomon convinces Patsey to join him. As they return to Epps' plantation, he is clearly drunk. Solomon whispers to Patsey that she avoid Epps, which Epps interprets as Solomon making a sexual advance. After a drunken chase around the yard, Mistress Epps intervenes, if only to express her disgust at her husband's obsession with Patsey. Later that night, Epps stumbles to the slave quarters and rapes her.
Mistress Epps has had enough of her husband's affair and chastises Patsey before cruelly slashing her face. Later that night, Patsey begs Solomon to strangle her and dispose of her body. She can no longer bear the burden of Epps's rapes and his wife's torments. Solomon refuses, despite her entreaties.
Some time later, we see that Epps's cotton crops have been devastated by insects. Two crops have been lost, and he decides to lend his slaves to a judge who can derive some use of them and pay the mortgage on their purchases. This returns us to the opening scene, where Solomon is cutting sugar cane. The judge notices Solomon's skill and recommends him to a neighbor seeking music for a party. As a bonus, the judge says Solomon may keep whatever wages he earns. The party is a fancy costumed affair, and Solomon clearly sees parallels between his old life as a free man and his forced servitude.The party is over, and it's time to return to Epps's farm. As Solomon walks up to the house, Patsey's bloody eye indicates that her torments have continued. The cotton crop is in, and that means it's back to the fields. This time, they are joined by a white laborer (Armsby) who is picking to earn money to get back on his feet. Even though his yield is well below any other worker, he is spared the whipping that all the other slaves receive. In the quarters, he tends to Solomon's wounds and tells his story. He appears to be a decent man and a sympathetic ear. Solomon decides to risk trusting him with sending a letter North, in hopes of securing his freedom. He gives Armsby all his earnings from the party and swears him to secrecy. He will deliver the letter to him in two days.
Solomon sets about creating ink and drafts the letter. Just that night, Epps enters the quarters and walks Solomon outside. Armsby has broken his word and told Epps everything. Fortunately, he told his story BEFORE Solomon gave him the letter. Thinking quickly, and playing on Epps's low opinion of slaves, he flips the story on Armsby, branding him a liar who is seeking to curry favor in order to get a job. This story persuades Epps and Solomon is spared. Later, Solomon burns the letter and watches as his hopes of freedom are extinguished in the ashes.Some time later, we find a team of workers building a structure with a hired hand, Bass. Bass is from the North and holds strong views that fly in the face of Epps's strongly pro-slavery leanings. They chatter back and forth in front of Solomon, piquing his interest. Later, Epps is in a lather about Patsey. She's gone missing, and Epps thinks she has run away. He threatens all the women with violence over her loss; however, she has simply been back to Shaw's plantation to visit her friend. She attempts to convince Epps that she is faithful to him and went there to get some soap, a ""luxury"" that Epps's wife has denied her. She loudly asserts her worth and insists that she deserves to be clean.
Epps is pushed over the edge by his wife's bickering and calls for Patsey to be tied to the whipping post. As he prepares to strike, he finds himself unable to inflict the punishment. Cravenly, he insists that Solomon do it. At first, Solomon attempts to be gentle, But Mistress Epps sees through the deception and nudges her husband to increase the severity. Epps points a gun to Solomon's head and claims he will kill every slave he sees if he doesn't whip Patsey harder. Faced with an unspeakable choice, he whips her harder, a pink mist of blood accompanying every new strike. After he pauses, Epps rushes forward, seething with rage and finally whips Patsey himself. The brutal punishment rends her flesh to shreds, and she collapses.Solomon finds himself alone with Bass, the hired hand. He asks where he's from and when Bass replies, ""Canada,"" Solomon offers convincing knowledge of the country. Bass asks how he's so well travelled, and Solomon explains his dire circumstance. Bass comes to believe Solomon's story and knows the horrible injustice of it. As they continue work, Solomon takes a chance and asks Bass to write letters to his friends in Saratoga. Bass agrees. Then the work is finished, and he leaves. A long shot lingers on Solomon. He has no idea whether Bass has kept his word. We don't know how long Bass has been gone, but the tears in Solomon's eyes indicate that perhaps he's beginning to think that he has been betrayed again.Now we see a group of men tilling the soil and planting seeds. A carriage pulls up to the Epps plantation, and an official looking man calls out for Platt (Solomon). He answers and approaches the man (a sheriff). The man asks him some questions and motions to another man in the carriage. It is Mr. Parker, a shop owner from Saratoga and friend of Solomon's. With little further prompting, the sheriff is convinced, and Solomon rushes to embrace his friend. Epps is enraged and shouts empty threats. The sheriff rebuts the arguments and Parker helps Solomon into the carriage that will take him to safety.
Patsey is there and calls out to him. Solomon leaps from the carriage to embrace her one last time before his departure. As he leaves, Patsey collapses in grief.
Now Solomon has been carried home. Outside his door, he appears overcome at having been delivered from his nightmare. Upon entering, he sees his family. They are 12 years older, but overwhelmed at seeing him. His daughter has married and named their son, Solomon Northup. Tears flow as they gather around him and welcome him home.
A series of title cards explain that he attempted to sue his kidnappers but failed. Northup became an abolitionist and aided many runaways in achieving their freedom."

After years of fruitless warning of his farmyard brethren of the coming Thanksgiving doom, Reggie the Turkey finds himself spared as the annual Pardoned Turkey. However, Reggie's easy life is disrupted by Jake, a fanatic turkey who drags him along with the insane idea of going back in time to make sure turkeys are not part of the first Thanksgiving. Through foolhardiness and luck, the pair manage to take an experimental time machine to do just that. Now in 1621 at the Plymouth colony, Reggie and Jake find themselves in the middle of a turkey clan's struggle for survival. In doing so, their preconceptions of the world and themselves are challenged forever in a conflict from which the world will never be the same.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Standing out from the rest of the flock for his exceptional intelligence, Reggie, an ordinary and plump farm turkey, realises the terrifying truth that his end is near, and so is for the remaining of his feathered companions. But, when the President of the United States himself chooses Reggie as the year's traditional ""pardoned turkey"", a lush life in the bosom of the White House awaits, only to be interrupted by Jake, the radical activist. Clearly out of his comfort zone, Reggie must team up with the strong-willed brother-in-arms to fulfil their species' higher mission: to travel back in time to the First Thanksgiving in the unknown Plymouth Colony of 1621, rewrite history, and make sure not a single turkey is ever again on the holiday menu.

However, his attempts to warn his farm-based flock constantly fall on deaf ears and has made him an outcast. When the other turkeys finally realize what's going on, they throw Reggie to the wolves in an attempt to save themselves. In a surprise twist of fate, he winds up being named the ""pardoned turkey"" by the President of the United States (Jimmy Hayward) and is subsequently taken to Camp David. Although initially hesitant, Reggie soon eases into a routine of doing nothing but enjoying pizza delivered to him by the Pizza Dude (Scott Mosier) and watching telenovelas.About three days before Thanksgiving, Reggie gets bag-kidnapped by Jake (Woody Harrelson), the president and the only member of Turkeys Liberation Front.[7] Jake tells him that a ""Great Turkey"" told him to find Reggie and take him back to the first Thanksgiving with him to take turkeys off the menu once and for all. Despite interference by federal officials and several attempts by Reggie to trick him back to the surface, Jake manages to commandeer an egg-shaped time machine with an A.I. software named S.T.E.V.E. (George Takei) and takes Reggie with him back to the same day in 1621. Once there, they are immediately attacked and separated by colonial hunters led by Myles Standish (Colm Meaney). Reggie and Jake are quickly rescued by native turkeys led by Chief Broadbeak (Keith David) and his two children Ranger (Jimmy Hayward) and Jenny (Amy Poehler), the latter of whom Reggie is immediately smitten with.

Despite initial hostility, Ranger and Jake find out that the settlers have already begun preparations for Thanksgiving as well as where they keep their weapons. Meanwhile, Jenny, who believes Reggie is lying about being from the future, is impressed with his unorthodox way of springing the traps. However, they are soon intercepted by Standish and Reggie is forced to get her in orbit over the planet aboard S.T.E.V.E., validating everything he said in the process.

However, Reggie has gotten sick of all his unproved stories and threatens to leave. Desperate, Jake tells him that this trip was more about him making up for him not being able to save three turkey eggs while escaping a turkey-fattening facility when he was younger, although still maintaining that the Great Turkey convinced him to go through with this. While still reluctant to believe what he said, Reggie still goes along with the plan. They manage to use gunpowder to destroy the weapons shack, but Jake inadvertently leaves a gunpowder trail back to the tree the turkeys are hiding under.

Throughout the years after the incident, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) become ruthless bounty hunters dedicated to exterminating witches. Their work is relatively easy because for an unknown reason, they are immune to harmful witch spells and curses. Hansel, however, is diabetic as a result of his ordeal with the old witch and needs to take a regular shot of insulin every day.One day, in the German town of Augsburg, Hansel and Gretel prevent Sheriff Berringer (Peter Stormare) from executing Mina (Pihla Viitala), a young woman falsely accused of witchcraft. Mayor Englemann (Rainer Bock) has hired the siblings to find and rescue several children abducted by witches. At the same time, Berringer hires four trackers for the same mission, hoping to regain the respect of the Mayor. However, all but one of the trackers are killed that night by the powerful grand witch Muriel (Famke Janssen), who sends the surviving member back to the town tavern to explode as a warning to the siblings and the locals. Hansel and Gretel, with the help of the Mayor's assistant Jackson (Bjørn Sundquist), capture the Tall Witch (Zoe Bell) and interrogate her.

As Adrianna was too powerful for the sacrifice, Muriel targeted Gretel, who was revealed to be a white witch herself. Muriel spread a rumor across the village about Hansel and Gretel's mother. To keep the siblings away from the angry villagers, their father left them in the forest, but when he returned to their home, he was hanged by the villagers while Adrianna was burned at the stake before his eyes.

Naturally, Eric looks through it and finds a page with some words scribbled out and the warning to not speak, write, or hear what is in it. He puts a piece of paper over the book and shades over it with a pencil, revealing several words that he begins to read. Outside, Mia starts being sick andd hears a faint voice calling her, and then sees a figure staring at her. She comes into the cabin and starts grabbing her things, saying she can't be there anymore. She jumps out the window and steals Eric's car, but as she drives through the woods, she sees the figure again and drives the car into a swamp.When she comes to, Mia tries to get out, but the figure rises from the swamp, and she runs away, tumbling into a thorn bush. The branches and sticks wrap themselves around her arms and legs, and the figure, which is a bloodied and horrifying version of herself, regurgitates a black wormy thing with thorns that makes its way up Mia's leg and goes right inside her. David and Olivia hear her screaming and find her.The group suspects she was trying to harm herself. David goes into her room, and she tells him that there is something in the room with them.He goes outside and sees blood on the ground. He calls for Grandpa and finds him in a hole beneath the tool shed. Grandpa is whimpering. David runs into the tool shed and pulls him out of the hole, but he's dead. David suspects Mia bludgeoned him to death with a hammer that was lying nearby.He runs back into the cabin and tries to get to Mia, but she's taking a shower. She turns the water up to the point where it becomes scalding hot and her flesh starts burning. The group pulls her out in time. Eric looks at an open page in the book and notices a picture of a being with burning flesh.David takes Mia in his Jeep and drives her to a hospital as she's foaming at the mouth. Unfortunately, the roads are flooded, and he has to turn back.Olivia gives Mia another sedative. While the group argues about her, she comes into the living room dragging a rifle. She holds it up, and fires near David, and the door swings open as Mia lets out a frightening scream. She says in a possessed voice ""You are all going to die tonight."" Olivia tries to get the rifle away from her, but Mia tackles her as her eyes turn yellow and she spits blood all over her. Olivia kicks her into the cellar, and Eric closes it. He suspects this has to do with the stuff they found down in the cellar.Olivia tries to clean the blood and throw up off herself, but she sees an image of herself mutilated in the mirror, which shatters. She walks away but then freezes, and her eyes twitch as she wets herself. Next to her is the book, open to a page with a person holding a knife and their severed face flesh.Eric goes into the bathroom to find Olivia, who is cutting the flesh from her cheek with the broken glass. Horrified, he stumbles backward and slips on the cheek flesh. Olivia stabs him with the broken glass and then in the face with the needle. Eric throws her off and breaks off a piece of the toilet, which he uses to bludgeon her to death, just as David and Natalie come in.David tries to patch up Eric's wounds. He tells Natalie to bring a jug of water and sugar. Eric tells her to stay away from Mia. He tells David that it's his fault this is happening because he read from the book.Natalie goes to the living room and finds that the cellar door is open. Mia is still down there, crying and asking for help. As Natalie tries to go down and get her, Mia's voice becomes low and demonic and threatening, saying ""He won't stop until he has all of you!"" Natalie tries to run but Mia grabs her and bites into her hand. She tries to defend herself with a box cutter but Mia takes it from her and slices her tongue down the middle. She grabs Natalie and kisses her, forcing blood into her mouth. David finds them and pulls Natalie out. They nail the cellar door shut, locking Mia down there.David finds Eric trying to burn the book, but it doesn't work. He tells David about what he knows from the book - an evil entity has been unleashed, and it's attached to Mia's soul. It seeks a collection of souls to unleash something called the Abomination.Meanwhile, Natalie tends to the bite wound on her hand. It starts to burn into her arm and she notices an electric knife and reaches for it. Mia peeks from the cellar and tells her not to cut it off, but Natalie slices into her arm. David and Eric find her as her arm falls off.Eric tells David there are three ways to put an end to this - bury Mia alive, dismember her, or burn her alive. David refuses to do any of that, and Eric calls him a coward. Suddenly, a noise is heard, and Natalie comes in, now possessed, with nails in her head. She's holding a nail gun and shoots at Eric, who gets a few nails in him. David tries to get the rifle, but Natalie starts hitting him with a crowbar. Eric shoots her with the nail gun, and she goes to start bludgeoning him with the crowbar. Before she can deliver the fatal blow, David blows her hand off with the rifle. Natalie appears to revert back to normal, complaining about the pain before she dies.David finally decides to burn the cabin with Mia still inside. He pours gasoline on the floor, but before he can drop the lighter, Mia, in her normal voice, starts singing a lullaby that their mother used to sing, and David cannot do it. Outside, a bolt of lightning strikes a tree, setting it on fire. He hatches another plan. He grabs two syringes, among other things, and starts to dig up a hole outside.He heads into the cellar. He finds Mia, who slashes at him with the box cutter and throws him around. She tries to drown him, but Eric steps in and hits Mia. He's also been stuck with the box cutter in his stomach. David goes to him, and Eric finally dies.David takes Mia outside with a bag over her head and starts to bury her. She talks to him in her normal voice and pleads with him, but he won't buy it. She starts telling him about their mother and more of her abusiveness. Their mother kept asking for David, who was never there, and how Mia would have to keep telling her he's coming back. He completely buries her, and then waits a while as the rain stops and the fire on the tree goes out. David digs Mia back up and pulls her out. He grabs a car battery with the syringes attached to it and sticks them in Mia's chest, trying to revive her. She doesn't come back. He covers her body and walks away tearfully. However, Mia rises and talks to David. She is completely back to normal, and they hug.The two go back into the cabin to get the keys to David's Jeep, but a possessed Eric is behind him and he stabs David in the neck. David goes into the hallway and gets Mia outside and locks her out. He grabs the rifle and shoots at the gasoline container, letting it consume the cabin in flames and killing himself and Eric for good.Outside, it starts raining blood. A hand bursts from the ground and grabs at Mia. It's the Abomination. It chases after Mia, who grabs a chainsaw from the tool shed and tries to run. She hides under the Jeep and manages to slice off the Abomination's legs, crippling it. As she tries to run, though, the Abomination tips the Jeep over and it falls on Mia's arm. She pulls herself free, severing her arm. The Abomination inches toward Mia, but she sticks her arm into the handle of the chainsaw and kills the Abomination. Its corpse sinks back into the ground.The bloody rain stops, and the sun comes out. Mia walks away, now free from the curse, but alone. Meanwhile, the book lies outside the burning cabin, closing itself and waiting for its next victims.Ash (Bruce Campbell) appears after the credits to say ""Groovy"" and dramatically turn to the audience."

Meanwhile, Judith doles out thoughtful advice to couples every day, yet remains completely powerless when it comes to addressing the issues surrounding her own troubled marriage. When an old college friend drops by her office, Judith faces her biggest personal challenge. The movie opens up in a rundown office where a marriage counselor is counseling a couple. Due to an argument, the husband walks out and the counselor notices a change in the wife's demeanor once the husband is gone. The counselor says she can tell that the wife has met someone, and that she would like to tell her a story about her sister, Judith.We then cut to a montage of Judith (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and her husband Brice (Lance Gross) growing up and falling in love in southern Virgina, throughout the years. Eventually, with the blessing of Judith's mother, Ms. Sarah (Ella Joyce), the couple marries and moves to Washington D.C. Brice gets a job at a local pharmacy working for the elderly owner Ms. Chapman (Renée Taylor), while Judith takes a job as the in-house therapist at matchmaking/dating service company owned by Janice (Vanessa Williams), a French woman. At the practice, Judith is constantly belittled by Ava (Kim Kardashian), Janice's personal secretary, for her lack of sex appeal and fashion sense.Over at the pharmacy, Brice and Ms. Chapman hire Melinda (Brandy Norwood) to work in the store, although Ms. Chapman has a stereotypical view of Melinda. Based on her boots and clothes, she think she's a lesbian. Melinda still takes the job.At Judith and Brice's small one bedroom apartment, Judith talks about wanting to start her own practice and move up. Brice reminds her maybe in 10 to 15 years when they are more established. He then decides to take Judith out to dinner to a cheap $5.99 buffet. After dinner, some young thugs make a sexual comment towards Judith who wants to say something, but Brice tells her to walk it off and let it go. Meanwhile, in another part of the city, Melinda is walking home and looking over her shoulder very afraid. Once she arrives at home at her one-room apartment, she puts about six locks on her front door and grabs a baseball bat for protection.The next day at work, Judith is introduced to Harley (Robbie Jones), a Zuckerberg-type computer software inventor who wants to invest in Janice's company. While speaking privately with Judith, Harley asks if he knows her, and he mentions that he's seen her running in the same park he does. Judith counters this by saying he's the shirtless man who is always trying to impress the ladies in the park. Judith then gives Harley a questionnaire about his love life and personality for him to fill out. At home, Judith mentions to Brice whom she met and that her mother will be paying a visit in the coming days.When Judith goes back to work the next day, Harley gives her a questionnaire to be completed, but he mentions that there are no questions about sex on the questionnaire. Judith says: ""we aren't that kind of business"". Janice informs Judith that she'll be working with Harley on the deal. Meanwhile at Brice's pharmacy, Melinda mentions that she needs to quit. Ms. Chapman asks her why, and she informs Brice and Ms. Chapman that her ex-husband attempted to kill her, and that she's been on the run for years trying to escape him. Ms. Chapman then mentions to her that she can't quit and that Brice will take her to and from work, so she feels safe.While working late one night, Harley verbally seduces Judith by asking her about her sex life with Brice, coming to the conclusion that Judith and Brice have a boring sex life, due to the fact that they basically only have sex in the bedroom. Harley mentions having sex in the car, in the kitchen, etc., and it's clear by Judith's face that she's turned on.

Brice shows up to pick up Judith, and they head home.A few days later, it's Judith's 26th birthday, and she decides to try something different with her makeup and hair.

As good as he is at body building, he's sexually frustrated as years of doing hardcore steroids in prison have really taken a toll on his body and his manhood. Lugo is employed as a trainer and consultant at the gym that they belong to and wants to be the most successful person he can be with the help of a sleazy motivational speaker, he aims for the top. Then enters Victor Kershaw - a Colombian immigrant and semi wealthy restaurant franchise owner who joins the gym. The manically picky Kershaw begins to taunt every aspect of the workout he's being provided with. Eventually Doyle and Lugo decide that they've had enough of his madness. The two kidnap and torture Kershaw for a month to gain access to his fortune, which they then proceed to live the high life with. Unfortunately, as good as they are at body building, these two criminally inept criminals will soon get involved in crime after crime, and don't exactly have the brains to match their muscles to figure out how or where they went wrong. But how long and how far does their ill gotten and ill perceived success go?—halo1k In 1994, in Miami, the ambitious bodybuilder Daniel Lugo believes in fitness and dreams on living the American Dream, full of money and women. He decides to be a ""doer"" and plots a scheme to make money. Daniel invites his fellow bodybuilders Adrian Doorbal, who is impotent due to steroids, and ex-convict Paul Doyle, who is Christian and addicted to cocaine, to kidnap the unpleasant self-made Colombian entrepreneur Victor Kershaw and extort his fortune. However the plan goes wrong since the clumsy amateurish trio is stupid and make a series of mistakes.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 1995, schemer Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is a recently released convict who had served time for Medicare fraud. Sun Gym owner John Mese (Rob Corddry) hires him to increase membership and make the gym more fitness-based. Lugo increases the gym's membership by 75% within six weeks and befriends trainer Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie), a bodybuilder rendered impotent due to his steroid use. Lugo soon lusts after the earnings and lifestyle achieved by Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub), a sleazy new member he begins to train, who Lugo believes is a crook. Inspired by motivational speaker Jonny Wu (Ken Jeong), Lugo decides to be a ""do-er"" and hatches a plan to extort Kershaw for his assets by kidnapping and torturing him.. The film opens with Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) running from large numbers of heavily armed Miami police officers, only to be hit by a police cruiser. Then the story goes back in time a few months. Lugo is a schemer and recently released convict who served time for Medicare fraud. Sun Gym owner John Mese (Rob Corddry) hires him to increase membership and make the gym more fitness based. Lugo triples the gym's membership within six weeks and befriends trainer Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie). Doorbal, a bodybuilder, uses steroids, which render him impotent. Lugo soon lusts after the earnings and lifestyle achieved by Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub), a new gym member he begins to train who Lugo believes is a crook. Inspired by motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong), Lugo decides to be a ""doer"" and hatches a plan to extort Kershaw for his assets by kidnapping and torturing him.Lugo recruits accomplices Doorbal and Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson), a recently released cocaine-addicted convict who has turned to Christianity. Though Doyle is reluctant to join the team, he soon caves in after a violent altercation with his priest. This ""Sun Gym gang"" unsuccessfully attempts to kidnap Kershaw at home but incapacitates him with a taser outside his deli and takes him to a small warehouse he owns (which is stocked with sex toys). The kidnappers disguise their voices, but Kershaw identifies Lugo from his distinctive cologne. The scheme goes as planned otherwise: Kershaw makes calls, under duress, to provide fake explanations for his disappearance, gets his family to move out of state, and signs the documents that transfer his assets to Lugo. Lugo even bribes John Mese to notarize documents in Kershaw's absence by presenting documents signed by Kershaw and using Kershaw's money to sponsor the Sun Gym.The Sun Gym gang is able to collect Kershaw's money and assets, but they realize releasing him is a bad idea. Therefore, Lugo concocts a plan to kill Kershaw by forcing him to drink liquor and crash his BMW, making it look like a drunken accident. When Kershaw survives the crash, the gang burns the car with Kershaw in it. Kershaw escapes the blazing vehicle, so the gang runs over his body and leaves him for dead. Unbeknownst to them, Kershaw survives and is hospitalized. The Sun Gym gang members spoil themselves with Kershaw's riches. Lugo takes over Kershaw's car and his home in a ritzy Miami suburb; Doorbal marries his nurse, Robin (Rebel Wilson), and uses his cut to purchase penile erection treatments; and Doyle abandons his restraints of religion and sobriety and fritters away his money on cocaine and his new stripper girlfriend.Kershaw reports what happened to the police, but they are turned off by his unpleasant manner and don't believe his bizarre story even when he gives them Daniel Lugo's name, particularly because of Kershaw's blood alcohol level. He then contacts Ed Du Bois, III (Ed Harris), a retired private investigator, who declines to take the case but warns Kershaw to quickly leave the hospital before the gang returns to kill him. Kershaw takes his advice and hides in a motel. Upon reflection, Du Bois takes Kershaw's case and tails the Sun Gym gang. He visits the Sun Gym and meets with Lugo, who is suspicious after he mentions Kershaw's name.When Kershaw calls Mese about his stolen money, Lugo, Doyle, and Doorbal go to the motel to kill Kershaw but arrive too late, as he has checked himself out of the motel and is hiding at an abandoned baseball stadium. When Lugo and Doorbal find out that Du Bois is paying for Kershaw's room using Du Bois's credit card, they plan to kidnap him at his home. They arrive and prepare to kidnap Du Bois, but the plot is thwarted when the police stop by to drop off Du Bois. In order to evade arrest, Lugo and Doorbal run and jump off the dock into the water. Du Bois gets a message from Kershaw and goes to the stadium to take him home. Meanwhile, Doyle has wasted all of his cut and attempts to rob an armored car. However, dye-packs planted in the money bag explode, and he narrowly escapes the police, getting his toe shot off. He and Doorbal (who depleted his share on payments for treatments, his and Robin's wedding, and a new home) explain to Lugo they need more money, and they propose another kidnapping.They target Frank Griga (Michael Rispoli), who owns a phone sex operation. After a promising discussion at Griga's mansion, the gang invites Griga and his wife Krisztina Furton (Keili Lefkowitz) to Doorbal's home to propose an investment scheme. However, Griga insists on meeting with someone more experienced and questions Lugo's amateurish business savvy. This angers Lugo, who attacks Griga and accidentally kills him. Krisztina discovers this and tries to shoot Lugo, but Doorbal injects her with a horse tranquilizer. Lugo and Doyle try to use codes obtained from a heavily sedated Krisztina to open a safe at her and Griga's home, but the codes do not work. When Krisztina rouses and tries to escape, Doorbal gives her a second injection, accidentally killing her.
Lugo and Doorbal purchase equipment to dismember the bodies and dump the body parts in several barrels, which they sink in a lake, while Doyle incinerates their hands (on a barbecue grill) to eliminate their fingerprints. Doyle loses his sanity over the violence and gore, leaves the gang, and returns to the priest's church. The police learn of Griga and Krisztina's disappearances, and with evidence from Ed Du Bois, they set a plan to arrest the Sun Gym gang. The film returns to June 17: The police arrest Doyle at the church, Doorbal at home, and Mese at Sun Gym. Lugo sees the raid and flees. Although he is hit by a police car, he escapes and heads out by sea in Kershaw's go-fast boat. Kershaw and Du Bois deduce Lugo is going after Kershaw's hidden bank account in the Bahamas and accompany the police to capture him. Lugo's pursuers catch up with him and Lugo runs. Du Bois shoots him, Kershaw chases Lugo in a car and incapacitates him, and the authorities arrest him. Lugo is brought back to the United States and stands trial with Doyle, Doorbal, and Mese. At the trial, it is revealed that Robin divorced Doorbal the night before she testifies against him.Daniel Lugo was sentenced to death, plus 30 days for ""being an asshole"" to a guard.

John O'Mara to assemble and lead an unofficial, off-the-books squad to deal with the Cohen problem. Parker makes this request specifically to O'Mara because of O'Mara's previous handling of some cases associated with Cohen's operations. O'Mara and the squad are not to kill Cohen - which would only lead to someone else taking over - but rather disable all his operations in such a way no other mobster would consider coming in.

As his men sweep the house for bugs, Grace runs away, fearing Cohen knows of her relationship with Wooters.The Gangster Squad is lured into a trap in Los Angeles's Chinatown by Cohen's head hitman Wrevock (Troy Garity), who was also responsible for Pete's death. Wooters interrupts the ambush just in time to save O'Mara, but Wrevock escapes. Karl Lennox (Holt McCallany), Cohen's right-hand man, kills Keeler in the unit's operation. Wooters asks Whalen to get Grace out of town, but Cohen reaches him first, looking for Grace, and kills him. O'Mara's house is later hit by a drive-by, and Connie gives birth to their son under the stress. Chief Parker tells O'Mara that, as a result of their failure, their careers with the LAPD are over. O'Mara gets Connie out of town, but refuses to leave with the job unfinished. Grace tells Wooters she is willing to testify against Cohen for Whalen's murder, prompting O'Mara, along with the remaining members of his unit, to go to the Park Plaza Hotel to arrest Cohen.Cohen and his men engage in a firefight with the police unit, with Wooters being wounded in the process after killing Wrevock. Cohen and Lennox escape, but O'Mara pursues them, which results in their vehicle crashing into a fountain. Kennard gets shot by Lennox, but manages to kill him with help from Navidad, before dying from his wounds. O'Mara prepares to arrest Cohen, but Cohen tempts him into fighting each other in a bare-knuckle boxing match, while a crowd of onlookers and journalists gather. O'Mara finally beats Cohen and has him arrested, ending his reign as a crime boss and the spread of the mafia into the Los Angeles area. The Gangster Squad was never mentioned in taking down Cohen, their surviving members remaining a secret. Cohen is sentenced to 25 to life, and is welcomed violently by Whalen's friends. Grace and Wooters continue their relationship, while Navidad and Harris become partners on the force. O'Mara quits to live a quiet life with his wife and son"

Over the course of the next six years, Valentin becomes a loving father to his growing daughter Maggie (Loreto Peralta) while rising through the ranks of fearless Hollywood stuntmen. Later, when Maggie's biological mother shows up determined to take back her daughter, Valentin realizes just how much meaning the little girl has brought to his frivolous life, and vows to fight for custody by any means necessary..

For six years, Valentín has been Maggie's true father and her best friend; however, Julie's unforeseen arrival will pave the way for trouble and heartbreak. How do you handle life when the instructions are not included?—Nick Riganas As a child, Valentín Bravo (Andrés Vázquez) was afraid of everything from heights to spiders. His father, Juan ""Johnny"" Bravo (Hugo Stiglitz), tried to make him fearless by making a tarantula walk on him and throwing him off a high ocean side cliff known as La Quebrada. When his father locked Valentín in a crypt at a cemetery, Valentín began to resent his father and ran away after stating that he no longer loves him.In the present day, Valentín (Eugenio Derbez as an adult) lives in Acapulco and is the local playboy who sleeps with every female tourist (both Mexican and foreigners) that crosses his path. One day a former fling named Julie (Jessica Lindsey), a young hippie American tourist, shows up at his doorstep with a baby girl, claiming that the baby is his daughter. Julie leaves the baby with Valentín after asking him for taxi fare, but she doesn't return. After receiving a phone call from Julie in which she says she is not prepared to raise a child, Valentín races to the airport to try to return the baby to Julie but fails to catch up to her before she boards her flight to Los Angeles.Valentín leaves Acapulco with the baby, Maggie, and hitchhikes across Mexico toward Tijuana. After being turned back at the US border when he realizes that he needs a travel visa to enter the USA (plus he has no money), he crosses by being smuggled in a hidden compartment in a transport truck driven by Lupe (Agustín Bernal) along with numerous other Mexicans. Going only by a single photo of Julie in which a Los Angeles hotel is visible in the background, Valentín visits the hotel to track down Julie. However, when Maggie wanders to a nearby pool and falls in, Valentín ends up jumping out of a hotel presidential suite into the pool 10 stories below, rescuing his daughter. A Hollywood movie director named Frank Ryan (Daniel Raymont) witnesses this event and hires Valentín as a stuntman, a job which Valentín accepts since he believes it is the only way he can support Maggie.An unlikely father figure, Valentín raises Maggie (7-year-old Loreto Peralta) for the next six years, giving her a happy, fun, carefree home in downtown Los Angeles. Meanwhile, he establishes himself as one of Hollywood's top stuntmen to pay the bills. The bilingual Maggie is his on-set coach and translator, as he still doesn't know (or hasn't bothered to learn) much English.

To hide from Maggie the fact that her mother abandoned her, Valentín writes weekly letters to Maggie from her, detailing various adventures and feats around the world to explain her absence. But Maggie wishes to meet her mother, so Valentín goes to his director, Frank, who looks for an actress to play ""Julie"". Before the casting is complete, Valentín gets a phone call from Julie saying that she is in Los Angeles and wants to get together.While out at dinner, Julie reveals that she is now a lawyer living in New York City and involved in a lesbian relationship with girlfriend Renee (Alessandra Rosaldo). After a tearful airport departure, Julie realizes that she doesn't want to just see Maggie during holidays. She files for full custody, citing Valentín's dangerous job, immaturity, and lack of English skills as reasons that he is unfit to raise Maggie. Valentín's sincerity and the story of his daring ten-story jump convince the judge that he has Maggie's best interest at heart, and he awards custody to Valentin as he is the only parent she has really known. Frank tries to persuade Valentín to tell the truth about something, but Valentín refuses.Not backing down, Julie asks for a DNA test which proves Valentín isn't Maggie's biological father. Valentín ends up losing legal custody of Maggie, but they sneak away and return to Acapulco, where he reunites with his friends... and discovers that his father has died a few years previously.Back in Los Angeles, Julie and Renee bully Frank into revealing Valentín's location. Frank repeatedly claims he doesn't know where they are, but eventually he relents and states that Valentín has woken up every day not knowing if it would be the last day he would see his daughter, but the details are not revealed on-screen.A few days later, Julie finds Valentín and Maggie on the beach and has surprisingly dropped her attempts to gain custody. Instead, the three enjoy time together as a family in Acapulco for the next two weeks while in a voice-over Valentín narrates how doctors can sometimes discover a heart defect for which there is no cure and which could kill the patient any time. As Valentín and Julie sit on the beach, Maggie falls asleep in Valentín's lap, then peacefully passes away: she, not Valentín, was the one with the heart defect.One year later, Valentín is seen walking down the beach, with a dog but without Julie, narrating that he now understands his father's motives in wanting to prepare him for the future and give him the courage to face his fears. The film concludes with a vision of Maggie playing in heaven with her grandfather."

When Jason refuses an offer to reduce his sentence by setting someone up to take a big fall, John pleads with U.S. Attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) to let him go undercover, and gather enough evidence to convict the real power players. With the help of ex-con-turned-family man Daniel (Jon Bernthal), John is hot on the trail of Malik (Michael Kenneth Williams), a vicious drug dealer and the leader of a notorious street gang. Meanwhile, in his efforts to free his son, John may have inadvertently put Daniel's family in jeopardy. Later, when the growing trail of clues leads John to ruthless cartel leader Juan Carlos ""El Topo"" Pintera (Benjamin Bratt), the loyal father vows not to let his fate be dictated by the ambitious powers that be on either side of the law.—ahmetkozan After unwisely accepting a late-night delivery of a big package crammed with ecstasy pills, Jason--the hapless eighteen-year-old son of the law-abiding construction company owner, John Matthews--ends up in federal prison, facing a punitive ten-year prison sentence. Determined to do anything to reduce his first-time offender son's harsh punishment, the ordinary father strikes a treacherous deal with the politically ambitious local U.S. Attorney, Joanne Keeghan, almost begging her to infiltrate the dangerous world of the local drug dealer, Malik. Somehow, John has to bring the ruthless drug dealer to justice; however, with the perspective of luring an even bigger fish--the legendary Mexican cartel kingpin, Juan Carlos ""El Topo"" Pintera--suddenly, Joanne changes the rules of the game. Is John prepared to give his life in exchange for Jason's freedom?—Nick Riganas Jason Collins (18) accepts hesitantly to delivery some ecstasy pills, which he and his girl want to try, for his buddy Craig, who takes the only possible plea bargain when told the minimal term is ten years: a short term for turning in Jason, who has no accomplice left to pass the buck and refuses to dob on principal. His father John Matthews, who neglected the knave running his own construction company bordering on disaster, finds the ambitious U.S. Attorney, Joanne Keeghan a true politician, strikes an irregular plea bargain: Jason -who is beaten in jail- out after months served if John can deliver a big fish. To that end, he identifies and bribes one of his ex-con 'social case' employees, Daniel James, who is desperate to stay within the law for his own kid son, as well-enough connected to drug dealer Malik to set a trap for Mexican cartel drug baron Juan Carlos ""El Topo"" Pintera. Mortally dangerous cat and mouse games ensue between DEA, real and undercover drug runners.—KGF Vissers John Matthews (Dwayne Johnson), owner of a construction company, receives a call from his ex-wife Sylvie Collins. His estranged son Jason (Rafi Gavron) is being charged for distribution of narcotics; while Jason is not actually a dealer, his friend set him up in a sting operation to reduce his own sentence after being caught. Jason's charges carry a minimum of 10 years in prison. John feels responsible because he was not there for his son, and he becomes desperate as he realizes that Jason may be killed before he finishes his prison sentence.Using his connections, John arranges several meetings with the local US Attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon), who is running a very aggressive anti-drug campaign to bolster her chances for election to Congress. Joanne agrees to reduce Jason's sentence if John can inform on a drug dealer, but states that he'll receive little help from her and that the risk will be all his. Agent Cooper (Barry Pepper) leads a task force which will monitor any dealings John arranges to use as evidence for an arrest. John searches through his employee records and finds an employee on his payroll with two former distribution convictions. Daniel James (Jon Bernthal) is currently leading a clean life to avoid a third strike, as he now has a wife and young son to care for. John offers twenty-thousand dollars if Daniel will simply introduce him to a dealer. Daniel initially refuses but later agrees so that he can move to a safer apartment for his son, though he is unaware that John is acting as an informant.Daniel introduces John to Malik, an extremely dangerous, high-ranking local drug dealer, who like Daniel has two strikes. Explaining that his business can not stay afloat in the current economy without a supplement to its revenues, John offers to run nearly limitless amounts of drugs at almost zero risk in his freight trucks. Due to being a legitimate business, the trucks avoid suspicion and carry too much freight to thoroughly search. Malik agrees under the condition that John and Daniel drive the initial run themselves.John and Agent Cooper arrange for several wire taps to be put in place to catch the transactions involved. John drives to the pickup point near the Mexican border. In the process, a rival gang ambushes the pickup, but John manages a daring escape, impressing cartel kingpin Juan Carlos ""El Topo"" Pintera (Benjamin Bratt), whose cartel successfully fights off the ambushers. John successfully completes his end of the deal, delivering the drugs to Malik while under surveillance by Agent Cooper. Malik mentions a meeting with cartel members higher than himself: Cooper, hoping to catch the higher priority targets, refuses to arrest Malik during the deal. Keeghan claims Cooper did the right thing and refuses to reduce Jason's sentence unless John cooperates in a second meeting. John, outraged, agrees only if Jason is released when the job is completed, rather than just a reduction in sentence. Around this time, Daniel finds out about the arrangement John made with the police and is furious, saying that the cartel will kill John, Daniel, and their families if the truth comes out. John and Daniel send their families into hiding.John meets with Juan Carlos Pintera under much higher cartel security than he has seen so far. Juan wants John to run nearly $100 million in drug profits into Mexico, back to the cartel base of operations, and offers to make John a member of the cartel inner circle if he succeeds. John reports this back to Keeghan and Cooper. Keeghan is ecstatic due to finding such a large target, but Cooper has a change of heart and tries to talk John out of doing the run, as he suspects the cartel will kill him afterwards.John devises a plan to free himself and Daniel from both the government and the cartel. During the run, John is able to escape Cooper's surveillance. At the same time, Daniel raids Malik's house, killing Malik's guards and wounding Malik. Before dying, Malik reveals Juan Carlos's cell phone number to Daniel. John calls Cooper and has him track both his new cell phone and Juan Carlos's phone, effectively giving Cooper both the money and the kingpin at once. After a highway chase and shootout, caused by the cartel's realization that John is an informant, John escapes. Cartel members and the money are seized by Cooper's men. Juan Carlos is also captured; he is unwilling to get into a shootout with the police, as his young son is with him.The movie ends with Jason being released the next day. John and his family go into the witness protection program. Daniel refuses to go into the program, saying he and his family will go into hiding on their own. As Daniel has lost his job, John leaves Daniel the large reward check that John was supposed to receive for the capture of Juan Carlos. The film concludes by citing statistics which show that certain first-time non-violent drug offenders receive longer prison sentences on average than those convicted of rape or manslaughter."

Activating an emergency beacon alerts two ships: one carrying a new breed of mercenary, the other captained by a man from Riddick's past. The infamous Riddick has been left for dead on a sun-scorched planet that appears to be lifeless. Soon, however, he finds himself fighting for survival against alien predators more lethal than any human he's encountered. The only way off is for Riddick to activate an emergency beacon and alert mercenaries who rapidly descend to the planet in search of their bounty. The first ship to arrive carries a new breed of merc, more lethal and violent, while the second is captained by a man whose pursuit of Riddick is more personal. With time running out and a storm on the horizon that no one could survive, his hunters won't leave the planet without Riddick's head as their trophy.—Universal Pictures Betrayed by the Necromongers and left for dead on a remote planet, Riddick learns to adapt to the harsh environment and rediscover his predatory instincts. When a more deadly threat appears on the horizon, he is forced to activate an emergency beacon attracting two ships: one filled with mercenaries, and another captained by a man with a personal vendetta against Riddick.—KCWP Five years after Kyra's death, Riddick has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshal of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects and assassination attempts by his subordinates. After the latest attempt on his life, Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako: the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako succeeding him as the next Lord Marshal, so that he can achieve what he calls transcendence. Led by Vaako's aide, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Realizing that it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive.. In this third Riddick film, set five years after 'The Chronicles of Riddick', Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshall of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects. Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako (Karl Urban); the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako becoming the next Lord Marshall. Led by Vaako's aide, Krone (Andreas Apergis), Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Recognizing it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive.Emerging from the rubble with a fractured leg, Riddick manages to reset and splint his broken leg and fend off native predators: vulture-like flying animals, viper-like swarms of water animals and packs of jackal-like beasts. Needing time to heal, Riddick hides himself within some abandoned ruins. Riddick later sees a vast savanna beyond some rocky cliffs, but the only passage through is guarded by poisonous, scorpion-like creatures called ""Mud Demons"" which inhabit several muddy pools. As he builds an immunity to the Mud Demon's venom, Riddick improvises melee weapons, while raising and training an orphaned jackal-beast pup. The two eventually succeed in defeating the Mud Demons and reach the savannah. Riddick soon realizes a massive series of approaching storms are unleashing countless more of the Demons, who must keep their skin wet at all times to survive. Needing to get off-world, Riddick activates an emergency beacon in an empty mercenary station, which broadcasts his identity and presence on the planet.Two ships promptly arrive in answer to the beacon; the first a group of bush-league bounty hunters led by a violent and unstable man named Santana (Jordi Mollà), and another better-equipped team of professional mercenaries led by a man named Boss Johns (Matt Nable). Riddick has left them a blood message vowing death to every merc unless they leave one of their ships and depart the planet on the other. Rubio (Neil Napier), Nunez (Noah Danby) and Falco (Danny Blanco Hall) are killed during the first night, forcing a reluctant Santana to cooperate with Johns. Riddick later manages to steal power nodes from each of the teams' ships and then approaches Johns and Santana to strike a deal for their return. However, the conversation turns out to be an ambush. Johns' second-in-command, Dahl (Katee Sackhoff), shoots Riddick with powerful tranquilizers. In an effort to defend his master, Riddick's alien jackal brutally attacks Santana, but is shot multiple times in the throat.Back at the Merc Station, Johns interrogates Riddick about the final fate of his son, William J. Johns (the mercenary from 'Pitch Black'). When the storms finally reach the station, large numbers of Mud Demons emerge from the muddy ground, and besiege the station, killing Lockspur (Raoul Trujillo) and Moss (Bokeem Woodbine). Johns agrees to release Riddick in order to locate the hidden power cells. Santana stops him and attempts to kill Riddick, who is worth twice as much dead as he is alive. Riddick instead beheads Santana thus keeping his earlier promise to kill the merc and avenge the death of his pet.They then fight their way to the ship which houses the hover bikes with Vargas (Conrad Pla) being killed. Johns, Santana's man Diaz, and Riddick leave the ship together on hover bikes on a mission to retrieve the power nodes. During their journey, Diaz knocks Johns' bike over the side, causing him to crash. He is then picked up by Riddick. After they reached the power nodes, Riddick reveals to Johns about his son's addiction to morphine and a spineless attempt by his son to utilize a child as 'bait' for the hostile animals on the world they were stranded on ten years prior. With both of them distracted, Diaz attempts to kill Riddick and Johns. Riddick fights and kills him, but not before unintentionally damaging the only working hover bike (Diaz had already disabled the other one).Riddick and Boss Johns fend off a seemingly endless horde of demons while running back to the station. Riddick is severely wounded. Johns takes both nodes and abandons Riddick. After treating his wound, Riddick begins to fight a futile battle against the advancing Demons. Just when it seems he is about to be killed, Johns arrives in one of the ships and shoots the creatures while Dahl descends to rescue Riddick. Riddick then takes the other ship and as he flies away from the planet he is stopped by Johns in the other ship. Johns asks Riddick where he will go, but thinks better and decides to not know. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son and departs into deep space, presumably to find Furya."

Violet Weston (Meryl Streep) has cancer and a propensity for pills and alcohol. She's a difficult woman to deal with and her husband has finally had enough. Violet's family gathers including middle daughter Ivy, youngest daughter Karen (with her new fiancé), eldest daughter Barbara (with her separated husband and teenage daughter), and her sister Mattie Fae (with her husband and son in tow). A family tragedy causes tensions to run high and secrets to come out. The Weston women will be forced to examine themselves and their lives whether they want to or not. Welcome to Osage County, Oklahoma in the sweltering heat of August.—napierslogs August: Osage County tells the tale of the dysfunctional Westin clan, who all come together after the death of patriarch Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard). His wife Violet (Meryl Streep), who is fighting mouth cancer and a growing dependency on pain pills, sees her entire clan return home for the services, including her sister Mattie Fae Aiken (Margo Martindale) and her husband Charles (Chris Cooper) and their son ""Little"" Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch). Also arriving are Violet's three daughters: Barbara (Julia Roberts) and her husband Bill (Ewan McGregor), Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), and wild child Karen (Juliette Lewis), who brings her fiance Steve (Dermot Mulroney). As the clan bickers and jokes, old truths come to the surface, jealousies flourish, and eventually each of the characters confronts some past hurt or future fear.. Family members of married Beverly and Violet Weston - the former an academic and successful published poet - convene at the family home in rural Osage County, Oklahoma during an August heatwave first on the news that Beverly has disappeared, this not the first such time he has voluntarily wandered off but which Violet believes is for good this time in the growing rift between the two, and then second upon Beverly's body being found in a suicidal drowning. Beverly's intentions may have been telegraphed by he having just hired compassionate Johnna Monevata, a young Cheyenne woman, as a cook and live-in caregiver much to Violet's displeasure. The rift between husband and wife was only exacerbated by issues surrounding Violet's mouth cancer, their relationship only one of the many dysfunctions between family members. That family includes Violet's sister Mattie Fae Aiken, and Beverly and Violet's three adult daughters Barbara, Ivy and Karen. Mattie Fae, her husband Charles, and their underachieving son ""Little"" Charles, live locally, and while Charles does whatever he can to support their son in his love for him, Mattie Fae does nothing but berate Little Charles and his underachievement. Violet and Mattie Fae were emotionally and physically abused by their mother and her various boyfriends when they were children, which is a large part of the dysfunction with their respective children. Colorado-based Barbara, the ""responsible"" daughter, has come with her academic husband Bill Fordham and their fourteen year old daughter Jean. Barbara has largely taken on the role of sole guardian to Jean as Bill has moved out in having an affair with a younger woman, something that Barbara has not told anyone else in her family. In the process, Jean resents her mother. Ivy, the ""lost"" daughter, is the only one of the three who has remained in Osage County to be there for her parents, and in the process has felt she has forgone her own life, she only having recently found love in nearing age fifty, she not having told anyone largely because of with who she has fallen in love. And Miami-based Karen, the somewhat unaware wild child, has come with her older fiancé, flashy fourfold divorced Steve Huberbrecht. As the dysfunction comes to a head especially between Violet and the girls and as the girls have to decide what to do about Violet in this last part of her life, a larger question becomes whether any of the girls can break the cycle of dysfunction.—Huggo"
Philomena,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2431286/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A world-weary political journalist picks up the story of a woman's search for her son, who was taken away from her decades ago after she became pregnant and was forced to live in a convent. When former journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is dismissed from the Labour Party in disgrace, he is at a loss as to what do. That changes when a young Irish woman approaches him about a story of her mother, Philomena Lee (Dame Judi Dench), who had her son taken away when she was a teenage inmate of a Catholic convent. Martin arranges a magazine assignment about her search for him that eventually leads to America. Along the way, Martin and Philomena discover as much about each other as about her son's fate. Furthermore, both find their basic beliefs challenged.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) 2002. Former BBC journalistMartin Sixsmith(Steve Coogan) is mildly depressed for being fired from his post as a press secretary for a British government minster for information misconstrued in something he wrote, he being the token fall guy in the matter. Initially thinking about writing about his forte of Russian history, he somewhat reluctantly, as his first post-firing job, decides instead to write a probably more lucrative human interest story onPhilomena Lee(Dame Judi Dench) when he learns of her plight from her daughter, Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin), his reluctance as he doesn't see himself as a writer of fluff. As a teenager, Philomena (Sophie Kennedy Clark) lived at Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea, Ireland as an unwed mother, there where she and the other unwed teenaged mothers were required to live and serve the abbey as ""repayment"" for four years. They all had limited access to their children, and while many, including Philomena, wanted eventually to leave with their children, they knew the nuns could and would adopt out the children if given the opportunity. Philomena's son, Anthony (Tadhg Bowen), was adopted when he was aged three, she not even being notified or thus allowed to say goodbye to him before it happened. Although Philomena has thought about Anthony her entire life and had made attempts to find him before, she has a strong feeling of uncertainty about him now on what would have been his fiftieth birthday. She doesn't necessarily want to see him, especially if she knows he doesn't want to see her, or blame anyone, especially those at the abbey as she is still a devout Catholic, but just wants to know that he is all right. In his time with Philomena, much of it just being the two of them alone, Martin, who has generally led a life of privilege, has to overcome his derision toward her solely because of her more provincial attitude. After visiting the abbey where most of the nuns from Philomena's time there have died, Martin decides to follow an anecdotal and thus unsubstantiated lead which takes the two of them to the United States. That rift between the two of them could widen if he discovers something in the story that she doesn't really want to know, or follow-up on, which could in turn be problematic as she may or may not be aware that he contractually has a story to write, he needing to find its most newsworthy aspects, good or bad.—Huggo Wrestling with the idea of finding a new direction, former BBC correspondent and recently ousted Labour government advisor,Martin Sixsmith(Steve Coogan), has a chance encounter with a woman whose mother - the God-fearing Catholic,Philomena Lee(Dame Judi Dench) - had her baby taken away from her nearly fifty years ago. Still feeling the pain of giving up her only child as an unmarried teenage mother, Philomena and Martin set off on a quest to find her son, starting off from her hometown of Washington, D.C., and then, to the convent where Philomena spent four years of her life. Will the two unlikely companions get to the bottom of this complex, fifty-year-old case?—Nick Riganas The title character of this movie is played by Dame Judi Dench. She is an elderly Irish woman who, as a teenager, gave birth while she was working at a convent. The Catholic Church had the child adopted, and now, decades later, Philomena is introduced to Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), onetime government spokesperson who is now working as a freelance journalist. Martin agrees to help Philomena look for her son, and the trail takes them to the United States, and brings them face-to-face with some long-buried secrets. All the while, the type-A Martin and the ceaselessly charming Philomena learn to trust each other. London-based journalist Martin Sixsmith has lost his job as a government adviser. He is approached at a party by the daughter of Philomena Lee. She suggests that he write a story about her mother, who was forced to give up her toddler son Anthony nearly fifty years ago. Though Sixsmith is initially reluctant to write a human interest story, he meets Philomena and decides to investigate her case.In 1951, Philomena became pregnant and was sent by her father to Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea in Ireland. After giving birth, she was forced to work in the convent laundry for four years, with little contact with her son. The nuns gave her son up for adoption without giving Philomena a chance to say goodbye. She kept her lost son a secret from her family for nearly fifty years.Martin and Philomena begin their search at the convent. The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for £1,000 each to wealthy Americans.Martin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the United States and invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed Michael A. Hess, who became a lawyer and senior official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. When Philomena notices Martin in the background of a photo of Michael, he remembers that he met him years earlier while working in the US. They also learn that he has been dead for eight years.Philomena decides she wants to meet people who knew Michael and learn more about him from them. They visit a former colleague of Michael's and discover that Michael was gay and died of AIDS. They also visit his sister Mary, who was adopted at the same time from the convent, and learn that they were both emotionally and physically abused by their adoptive parents, and hear about his partner Pete Olsson.After avoiding Martin's attempts to contact him, Pete agrees to talk to Philomena. He shows Philomena some videos of his life with Michael. To Martin and Philomena's surprise, they see footage of Michael, dated shortly before he died, at the Abbey where he was adopted, and Pete explains that, although he never told his family, Michael had privately wondered about his birth mother all his life, and had returned to Ireland in his final months to try to find her. Pete informs them that the nuns had told Michael that his mother had abandoned him and that they had lost contact with her. He also reveals that, against his parents' wishes, he had Michael buried in the convent's cemetery.Philomena and Martin go to the convent to ask them where Michael's grave is. Despite Philomena's efforts to stop him, Martin angrily breaks into the private quarters and argues with an elderly nun, Sister Hildegarde McNulty, who worked at the convent when Anthony was forcibly adopted. He accuses her of lying to a dying man and denying him the chance to finally reunite with his mother, purely out of self-righteousness. Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of wedlock.Martin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition. Philomena then asks to see her son's grave, where Martin tells her he has chosen not to publish the story. Philomena tells him to publish it anyway."

As the Manzonis use their unique set of skills to survive the relentless storm of bullets, bombs, and rockets, the citizens of this peaceful French village suddenly find themselves in the middle of an all-out Mafia war zone.. The camera pans out on a family of four eating a meal together. The doorbell rings, and the husband/father answers. As he puts his eye to the peephole, a bomb explodes, blowing his corpse back to the dining table. The wife/mother frantically tries to call the police as a man in a black hat and coat walks through the destroyed door, holding a gun. He rubs out the rest of the family, including both adolescent kids, without a word. He then takes a hatchet from his briefcase and hacks off a finger from the man's hand.The voice of Fred Blake (Robert De Niro) says that the only question people should ask is the value of a man's life. Fred says he's worth $20 million, and he'd give away the entire fortune to get his old life back.Fred is riding in a car driven by his wife, Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer), while their two kids, Warren (John D'Leo) and Belle (Dianna Agron) ride in the back with the family dog, Malavita. They're all heading toward a new home in Cholong-sur-Avre in Normandy, France. Maggie is unsure of the house's exact location because the houses on the street have no numbers, but Fred is able to locate the correct house due to instructions from an acquaintance named Stansfield.They all get settled in, unpacking some of their belongings, which are already there (although the TV is late in arriving). During small talk, it's revealed that the Blake family has lived in the Riviera and Paris.Maggie offers to help Fred unpack, but he tells her to get the kids to bed, as they have school the very next day. The real reason, however, is that unknown to the rest of the family, Fred had a dead body in the trunk. He buries it in the back yard while nobody is looking.In the morning, over breakfast, it's revealed that the Blake family has used different surnames in different parts of France. After Warren and Belle leave for school, Maggie tells Fred she's going to pick up groceries, and that Stansfield said that until he arrives that day, Fred shouldn't step outside the house. They need to come up with something to tell the neighbors, and if anyone were to ask, they should say they're American.The Blake family are federal witnesses. Fred's real name is Giovanni Manzoni, and he and his family were part of a mafia family from Brooklyn. Giovanni's grandfather drove one of the cars at the funeral procession for Vito Genovese's wife, and Gio's father was one of 107 mob bosses to attend a notorious 1957 Apalachian Convention. Giovanni and his family are in Witness protection because he turned informant and testified against a high-ranking Don named Luchese (Stan Carp), sending him to jail. Squeaking rats being one of the most despised things among the mafia, the whole Manzoni family has a $20 million bounty on their heads. Stansfield is the family's FBI contact.Soon as Maggie is gone, Fred steps outside. He's seen through a camera lens, and he seems to turn right toward it, as if he knows the person or persons with the camera, are there. Later, he rummages through some of the family belongings until he finds something he appears to prize: a manual typewriter.The Manzonis waste little time starting to run afoul of the locals and the way of life in Cholong-sur-Avre, and they deal with it the best way they know how: mafia style. Maggie stops for coffee and learns the closest sightseeing attractions are in another town, twenty kilometers distant. Warren runs into a group of young French students led by Andre (Jonas Bloquet), who want to shake him down for some cash, take his backtalk with disdain, and mudhole stomp him in a locker room.Maggie is annoyed with the stereotypical anti-American sentiment of the French grocery store owner and two French customers. She grabs some materials that act as a makeshift explosive and sets it off in the back of the store, destroying much of it.Meeting for lunch, Belle and Warren strategize. As the outsiders in a foreign school, they need to stick close together. Warren has cased a majority of the students and has learned who runs 'contraband' (like cigarettes), and who can be exploited for what-- including the potential to turn the tables on Andre's gang, who beat him up and hit on Belle.Fred begins typing a memoir of his life on the typewriter. Later, he goes out into the backyard and is spotted by a neighbor tending to his rose garden. The neighbor strikes up small talk, which proves troublesome for Fred. Asked about his work, he says he's a writer. Afraid to say he writes novels, because he doesn't know anything about it, he says he's writing about the armed forces landing at Normandy on D-Day... and finds his neighbor knows a lot about this subject; much more than Fred himself.Maggie visits a church, where the local priest makes her acquaintance. He greets new arrivals cordially, which is something Maggie feels she and her family need right now.After school is done for the day, Warren goes right to work. He finds that an engineer's son collects trading cards for the Paris S.G. and is only missing one card, ready to give anything in return for it. Warren assures the youth he'll see if he can help acquire it. Meanwhile, Belle is walking home when Andre and his gang start following her in their car, offering her a ride. When Belle realizes she missed a turn trying to ignore them, they take advantage, asking where she lives and then telling her it's miles away, and it'll be dark before she gets home. Against her better judgment, Belle accepts the offer of a ride, and she doesn't need long to see through the French boys' charm; they drive to a local leisure park and lay down a picnic blanket. They clearly have seduction on their minds. Their overconfidence proves deadly, as they allow Belle to rummage through the trunk of their car, where she finds a tennis racket. She knocks Andre down and viciously bashes the racket against his head until it breaks, before giving the shocked boys a stern lecture on how young women deserve to be treated. She gets in their car and drives off, leaving them there. She drives partway home before leaving the car on the shoulder of the road and walking the rest of the way.The scene shifts to Attica State prison, where a guard delivers a bucket of ice to Don Luchese. Despite being in prison for life, Luchese lives like a king, with a private cell furnished nearly as well as a good quality motel room, and at least one of the guards caters to him as well. One of Luchese's underlings is in the prison with him. He takes the bucket and dumps it in the sink; among the ice is the finger hacked off from the man who was killed the beginning of the movie. The ice kept it fresh so that Luchese is able to take a fingerprint and compare it to Fred's prints from a copy of his Buffalo police record. The prints don't match, so Luchese knows that the Manzonis are still alive. They call Rocco (Jon Freda), who carried out the hit, to inform him, and he promises to continue looking.The Manzonis are making small talk over dinner when Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones) shows up to see how their first day went. He's also there to make sure the Manzonis behave themselves: two weeks ago, in Nice, Maggie bought a dozen lobsters from a man named Mourad, that turned out to be rotten; Fred beat Mourad to a pulp, and two days ago, Mourad went missing (he's the stiff that Fred buried in the backyard). That the Manzonis bought a whole dozen lobsters smacks of a 'business deal;' the kind the Manzonis aren't allowed to make, as per the terms of the Witness Protection program. Stansfield has had to relocate the Manzonis numerous times because of how they all handle 'fitting in' at each new place. His job is to keep them safe, but they're making his job very hard.That night, Fred has a nightmare about a party he and Luchese's men co-hosted back in Brooklyn; he happens to turn and look at Luchese, who runs a finger across his throat, and suddenly every guest at the party turns toward Giovanni, pointing a gun at him.Fred is at his typewriter again, continuing his memoirs. He says, in a voiceover, that Stansfield's duty is to tell the 'official' version of what happened to get a $20 million bounty on the lives of all four Manzonis. Fred wants to write down the whole truth, just once, without any deception, even if nobody reads it. He says his story is impossible to just make up. It turns out Maggie has suspected what Fred was up to, and she's plenty angry about it, even a single typed hardcopy, as opposed to something written on computer disk, is at risk of being seen by the wrong eyes. Maggie insists she could have been consulted, but the last time Fred did that, she had him say he was an architect and suddenly everyone was coming to him for advice on expanding their homes. For now, Maggie wants her husband to be a plumber; the sink's tap water is brown, and can't be trusted for washing or drinking. She called the local plumber twice and he never showed.Maggie steps outside, looking around for prying eyes, and goes to a nearby house where two FBI agents, Caputo (Domenick Lombardozzi) and DiCicco (Jimmy Palumbo), are watching over their safety. She brings them some home-cooked food, making pleasant small talk. Unlike Fred, Maggie knows the value of proper diplomacy and keeping on the agents' good side... and she can use the company, being Americans in a country infamous for not looking kindly on most Americans. During small talk, it's revealed that Stansfield is arranging for the Manzonis to host a block barbeque to meet and get acquainted with most of the neighbors.The next day at school, during lunch, Belle and Warren again strategize. Warren has been hard at work doing 'business' of his own; he's made a fake copy of the last trading card the engineer's son needs; in return he gets a copy of math homework which he trades to another student for another favor. He also gets a copy of the Goth girl's school report, promising to alter it in a way her parents would like, in return for an equal share of the cigarette market. He also 'picked up' a splinter so he could raid the school nurse's medicine cabinet for some energy pills he sells. Belle, meanwhile, found out who took something from her purse, and beat the girl to a pulp in the rest room.Belle looks across the lunch room and her gaze falls across a handsome young man, who Warren knows is a college student doing substitute teaching work for a disliked regular who's on maternity leave. The substitute is studying for a very difficult math exam, and all the senior-level girls have the hots for him.Still with Caputo and DiCicco, Maggie looks through their binoculars with which they spy on, and gather information about, all the neighbors, to watch for any security threats. Maggie also sees the plumber show up at her house, and smiles to herself in satisfaction.The plumber, Ramirez (Tonio Descanvelle), tells Fred that the brown water could be a result of either the house's pipes, which are very old, or the town water mains. If it's the mains, the Manzonis would need to take it up with the town mayor; if it's the pipes, they'll need a full overhaul, which will cost a great deal of money and take a great deal of time. Ramirez gets very condescending and rude as he suggests Fred call Ramirez's wife, pay 50% up front and make another appointment. He boasts about his family, fathers and sons, being plumbers for five generations.When Ramirez asks Fred about his line of work, Fred turns toward a nook in the basement and pulls out a baseball bat. Cut to Maggie still watching through the binoculars, and she sees Fred carrying an unconscious Ramirez out of the house and putting him in the back of his plumber van, before Fred gets into the driver's seat and drives the van off.As school ends, Belle makes her move on the substitute, Henri (Oisín Stack), telling him she needs private tutoring in math.Andre and gang meets the engineer's son to acquire a hi-fi they need for a pre-prom party, only to find that the engineer's son and several other students are working with Warren. The bully gang gets their taste of being on the wrong end of a beatdown.Fred has brought Ramirez to a hospital after having beaten him with an inch of his life with the baseball bat. He's unable to explain to the doctor how Ramirez became so badly injured from 'a fall down stairs,' but finally provides a street-smart escape by saying he's not a doctor himself.Rocco is speaking with Mourad's family, showing them a photo of Fred. He's posing as an FBI agent looking into disappearances. Mourad's wife tells Rocco that Fred is a friend of her husband, and unlike in the photo, he has a beard now. Rocco's questioning makes one of the sons suspicious and he asks to see Rocco's FBI badge. Rocco flashes an evil smile as he agrees to the request, and we then see him looking around shiftily as he steps out of the apartment, after he's killed the whole family.Fred is writing his memoirs, and in a voiceover and flashbacks, he goes over a list of ten points that show he's a 'good guy;' of course, the flashbacks show scenes of his time running a crime ring in Brooklyn that demonstrate just how 'good' of a guy he really is. His top point is that he only causes pain with good reason. Cut to his beating Ramirez senseless with the baseball bat, pounding on him until the bat breaks, and then picking up where he left off with a short-handled mallet.Maggie confronts Fred about crippling Ramirez, but he shuts her up by pointing out he knows about the supermarket she blew up. He starts coming on to his wife, and she's reluctant at first, but Fred knows how to turn the charm up in ways she can't resist.Preparing for the barbecue, Maggie tells Belle that Henri called to find out what time it was. Despite Belle's protests that he's just tutoring her in math, Maggie knows what is really on her daughter's long-term goal list. Warren arrives home with bottles of Coca-Cola, assuring his mother that the French neighbors will be expecting 'greasy, fatty American slop' from the American family living among their midst.As Warren predicted, the whole neighborhood shows up for the barbeque. Stansfield calls Caputo and DiCicco and tells them to go too, as all the neighbors are there and they need to blend in.Maggie greets the incoming guests, playing perfect hostess, until she notices one neighbor (who Caputo and DiCocco had told her, was kleptomaniac) quietly pocketing some silverware. Maggie pours the neighbnr some champagne and whispers to her to put the silverware back or Maggie will break her arms.Fred hasn't come out yet; he's still writing. Maggie sends Belle to get him. Fred quietly tells Belle one of his regrets; despite the zeal with which he carried out his work as a crime boss, he regrets not always having done right by his kids. Belle assures him that she loves him and wouldn't trade him for any other father, and this convinces him to come out.No sooner is Fred preparing the barbeque, however, when several neighbors start telling him that the method he's using isn't efficient, and how he should really be doing it for better results. He smiles politely, but his eyes show his irritation. As they continue laughing, we see Fred lose his cool and start maiming them-- until Stansfield taps his shoulder, showing it was just Fred imagining it. Sharing a drink with Fred at the bar, Stansfield reveals that Whalberg, a contact who's recently been elected to the Senate, was worried about Fred telling the latest neighbors that he's a writer. Whalberg and Stansfield know that Fred is writing personal memoirs, and Stansfield is there to caution him about what he puts in them, and whether or not it's a good idea to let anyone see them.As the party is wrapping up, Maggie comforts Belle about Henri not having shown, and Stansfield drops a not-so-subtle warning to Fred regarding one of Gio's former associates.The next morning as they walk to school, Warren tells Belle that Fred can turn the word 'fuck' into one of the most versatile in the human vocabulary, which makes it curious how he spends so much time writing.Fred goes to see the mayor about the town water main, only to be given a runaround. The mayor insists that the water main is working normally and makes a sticking point about the Manzonis being new in town. Fred shakes hands politely, but we see him enjoying the thought of grabbing the mayor and using the mayor's desk drawer to crush his fingers.At the school study hall, Henri notes that Belle has improved considerably, but she sees she really has her work cut out for her when she learns that once he passes his exams, he plans to move to Paris in search of a full-time main teaching position.Meanwhile, following the trail, Fred visits the town water main. The maintenance supervisor shows that the water is already brown when it reaches the water main, and he suspects a nearby chemical fertilizing plant; the only one of its kind in the area.Maggie is praying at church when the priest arrives. The priest notes that Maggie often comes to pray during midday, but never at Mass. He asks if she's interested in making confession. Maggie warily asks about priest confidentiality, and he assures her that the oath is sacred.During class, one of Warren's teachers requests a homework assignment that's overdue from him; a short story written in English, on wordplay and double meanings, for the school newspaper. She gives him a strict deadline, leaving him scrambling to come up with something on the fly. Remembering a neighborhood mafia party at which all of Luchese's family were present, Warren remembers a double entendre recited by Luchese regarding Boris Godunov: ""If it's Godunov for you, it's good enough for me."" The much younger Warren had found it funny and laughed along with it. Warren quickly writes it all down for his teacher, and it's printed in the school newspaper. Of course, a copy of this newspaper ends up in the one pair of hands it was never meant for: Don Luchese (a funny series of actions shows how the paper arrives in his cell and gets his attention). He recognizes the short story immediately and glares at the credit: ""Warren Blake, 3e2.""Fred has just enough time to walk into the office of the chemical fertilizer company president, Mr. Chambard (Serge Tranvouez) when he's told not to talk about the 'brown water' problem. Chambard gives a shockingly rude and crude suggestion to buy bottled water instead of using free tap water. This time it's no mere moment of personal imagination when we see Fred drag a badly beaten Chambard out onto a road with Chambard's motorcycle, threatening to drag him along the road by the cycle. Chambard tells him about one of the turbines and where it is; if his company is responsible at all, the turbine would be the culprit.Fred arrives home to find Stansfield reading his memoir manuscript, and they have it out over the writing, as well as Fred continuously escaping regular FBI surveillance, which is enough to warrant termination of Witness Protection. Stansfield tells Fred he wants the manuscript when Fred is finished.Henri is packing to take a train to Paris, and has prepared some home work for Belle. But it's Belle who's donning the teacher's cap for a lesson in something quite different from math, in the privacy of the office.Mr. LeMercier (Cédric Zimmerlin), the English teacher whose face Fred imagined pushing down on the hot barbeque grill, calls to tell Fred that he's hosted Cholong's film society for five years now; they show a classic film, followed by a debate on it. He's asking Fred to attending a showing of the classic filmSome Came Running (1958)by Vincente Minnelli. Not wanting to come across as rude, Fred tells LeMercier that he'll get back to him.Soon as Fred hangs up, DiCicco, who along with Caputo, listen in on all calls to and from the Blake home, promptly grills Fred about his response. Stansfield shows up a few moments later, furious at Fred's leaving the decision open, because it can blow his cover. Trying to defend himself, Fred points out he's supposed to 'integrate' to the community and didn't want to give them a rude brush-off. Fred insists he's going to get a copy of the movie in advance of the showing, watch it at home, and then he's bringing Stansfield to the film society showing and debate, which will earn Stansfield a good write-up in Fred's memoirs (a promise that draws a chuckle from Stansfield).Don Luchese sees Fat Willy (Vincent Pastore), one of the heavy muscle in his organization, and shows him a copy of the newspaper from the school Warren and Belle attend. He orders all available men to head there at once and kill all of the Manzoni family.Warren is summoned before a faculty board to answer twenty-two student complaints. The committee head offers for him to take his pick of where to start: assault, corruption, bullying, and threatening students and faculty alike.Caputo and DiCicco are finding continued surveillance of Fred getting tedious, as he simply sits at his desk in the shed. But in fact, they're watching a cleverly made-up mannequin, as Fred has gone to the chemical fertilizer plant's main turbine. He wires a batch of explosives to a wind-up alarm clock and places it where it will do the 'most good,' but not be easily spotted.Henri calls Belle to tell her that he's certain he's gotten an excellent grade on his exam to qualify for a full-time teaching position, and he's going to stay in Paris a few days to look for an apartment and see his father. Belle's smile reverses as Henri then tells her that her seduction of him was 'a fabulous moment' and 'an experience.' Belle starts to cry as Henri tries to downplay what she thought was a declaration of her undying love (even Caputo and DiCicco call him an asshole for 'doing it over the phone'). Belle tells Henri that love was the only thing that could extract her from the crazy life she's been required to lead, and he's just crushed it, before she hangs up and breaks down in tears.Stansfield shows up to attend the film showing and debate with Fred. He's still quite displeased at being roped into it. Rather than walk, Stansfield says they'll take his car.If life was not taking enough of a downturn for the Manzonis, Maggie goes to the church during a flea market, to find the priest has turned against her. He's appalled and horrified at the confession she's made as the moll of a mob boss. He's under sacred oath not to share the confession, but it's haunted him all week, calling her family out as having made a pact with the devil. He demands she leave the church and not return.The film showing is about to start when LeMercier announces that the Normandy Cinema association has sent the wrong film. Instead of Some Came Running, the film of the night will beGoodfellas (1990), by Martin Scorsese. Stansfield is horrified, wanting to drag Fred away and out of the showing then and there, but Fred pushes for them to stay, because it would look too suspicious if they ran away now; and more importantly, because Fred is extremely familiar with the meaning of the movie's storyline and background, he can be a very credible figure in the debate.Belle overhears Warren hurriedly arriving home and hastily packing. Warren tells his sister that he doesn't want the Feds blaming her and their parents for what he's done at school, so he's running off to Paris. He's prepared forged ID and a passport to assist him in 'starting in the business.' Warren sees that Belle is wearing one of Maggie's pearl necklaces; she tells him she's going to be with the man she loves. Belle hugs her brother and wishes him good luck, telling him she loves him.The showing of Goodfellas finishes and LeMercier asks Fred to sit up front for the debate. Stansfield listens as Fred starts to describe the start of a young teenage boy's start in a life of crime that sounds eerily like his own beginnings.Warren is at the train station waiting for a train to Paris. A train pulls up, and a number of burly men debark, all carrying heavy leather cases and wearing trenchcoats. Warren nearly has a heart attack as he recognizes these men as Luchese's. For a moment he thinks he's dead, but the men walk past him, not paying attention, and not recognizing him, as it's been several years since any of them had last seen him as a child. They pile into two black cars that are waiting for them.With Rocco and Willie are a number of serious heavy hitters: Bernie (Anthony Desio), Tommy (Ted Arcidi), and Billy the Bug (Michael J. Panichelli Jr.), all of whom are huge and burly. Seasoned hit men Paulo (Raymond Franza), Mezzo (David Belle), and Albert (Paul Borghese) round out the hit team.Warren hurries to a phone booth to warn his family. Caputo and DiCicco wonder why nobody's answering, until they see Maggie's car pull in. But just as Maggie reaches the phone, Warren has run out of the phone booth, leaving the phone dangling off the hook.As the two cars drive down the road, Rocco calls Albert on a cell phone and tells them to take care of the fire house, and then meet him and his group outside the town hall. His men will be getting a feel for the town in order to carry out their mission quietly, quickly, and without raising a general alarm.Fred is a huge hit at the post-movie debate, but Stansfield isn't pleased. He calls Caputo and DiCicco, telling them to round up Maggie and the kids for Plan B.Belle calls Henri from a cell phone she's mugged another girl for. She tells him that she just wanted to say that she loves him and that she wanted to hear his voice one more time, 'before she goes.' The camera pans out to show she's on the roof of the Cholong church, and the meaning of 'before she goes' becomes ominously clear.As it happens, Belle is right across from the local police station, and she glances down to see Rocco and Bernie with their men arriving there. They quickly ambush and kill the officers on duty, and access the computer, inputting the name Warren Blake. When a Fred Blake, Maggie Blake and Belle Blake all also come up at the same address, they know they've hit paydirt. Belle watches in growing fear as Rocco and his men exit the station and return to their car. She hurriedly tells Henri she'll call him back; all thoughts of killing herself turning into a need to protect her family.The other group of Luchese's men arrive at the fire house, taking out the one man on duty and puncturing all the tires on all the fire trucks. Warren sees them pulling up to the fire house and turns away desperately, so they don't see his face.Maggie checks in with Caputo and DiCicco, who tell her that Stansfield has ordered emergency evacuation of the family. Fred's performance at the debate has earned him the accolades of, and a standing ovation from, everyone except Stansfield, who's sure that loose lips about his regalement of them with his stories, will lead back to him. Little does Stansfield know that Luchese's men, in a cafe not far, are already meticulously planning their hit; a fully coordinated assault on the Manzoni household. They're not taking any chances at blowing the $20 million bounty. They synchronize their watches; it will be midnight, French time, in 15 seconds.Midnight hits, and the explosives Fred planted at the chemical fertilizer plant's turbine, goes off, destroying the turbine and giving Fred an airtight alibi; he was at the film society meeting, with Stansfield in attendance, the whole night.Everyone, however, feels and hears the rumble from the explosion: Luchese's men, Caputo and DiCicco, and Fred and Stansfield. The feds call the emergency response crews to find the switchboards are down, which they know means serious trouble. Racing back to the Manzoni house with Fred in tow, Stansfield warns Fred that there had better be no trail leading anywhere near him; that Fred's alibi is so airtight is exactly what makes him so suspicious.Stansfield drops Fred off at his house, forbidding him to leave, and calls DiCicco to tell him that he wants the whole family in the house while he swings by the police station.Rocco and crew pull up to a town square and spread out to get a feel for the area. Rocco knows that the Manzonis have federal officers nearby watching them, and he dispatches Bernie to find and deal with them.Despite orders to the contrary, Caputo and DiCicco give in to Maggie's pleas that she be allowed five minutes to find Warren and Belle, and pack some clothes. As she heads toward her house, she spots several of Luchese's men carefully spreading out and staking out key street intersections and all possible avenues of escape for them to cut off and intercept. Making it back to the fed house, she gasps for air and tells Caputo and DiCicco. ""They're here. The streets are crawling with them.""Stansfield arrives at the police station and finds the dead officers. He warns his men that a cleanup operation is underway.Fred turns on his water faucet and is pleased at seeing clear, clean water emerge. It's the urgent barking of the dog, Malavita, that alerts him to possible trouble. Luchese's men are unpacking all their hardware for the cleanup. Peeking through the window, Maggie gasps in horror at seeing Billy the Bug preparing a portable rocket launcher. She calls Fred, tearfully begging that he pick up the phone. Fred stares at the phone as it rings, listening to both the ringing and Malavita's agitated barking. He's unsure whether the incoming call is to verify that he's home as preparation for a hit.Billy releases the rocket, and the explosion is seen and heard across Cholong. Stansfield steps on the gas to hurry to the Manzoni home. Caputo covers Maggie's mouth to mute her scream. Paulo, on lookout, kills two neighbors who step outside, including Arnaud. Grabbing their heaviest duty ordnance, DiCicco and Caputo tell Maggie that they're going to step out their back entrance, and Maggie is to wait for their signal before following.The two feds never reach the door: Bernie is waiting outside with his automatic rifle, and he kills them both before they know what hit them. Maggie cowers in a corner, but it takes Bernie very little time to find her. Bernie has enough respect for Maggie as a person, that he wants to kill her clean and quick. But mob rules demand no such respect for the family of a rat. She must be raped before she's killed. But although dirty and a little shaken up from the explosion, Fred is otherwise unscathed, and has made it there unseen. He jumps on Bernie's back from behind, grabs Bernie's belt, which the enforcer had removed while undoing his pants, and uses the leather strap as a garotte. Bernie fights viciously, but Fred hangs on like a bulldog. The chokehold finally starts to sap Bernie's strength. Seeing her husband's defense of her, and Bernie weakening, Maggie finally grabs a big kitchen knife and stabs Bernie in the chest, finishing him.Paulo goes to reload, but Warren and Belle have arrived back home. Belle whacks Paulo from behind just as he turns back around, and she and Warren arm themselves with spare guns. They ambush the remainder of Luchese's men, and even Malavita gets in a kill. Both Belle and Warren run out of ammo, and Warren hurries to the car to grab another. He grabs a shotgun and turns just in time to kill Mezzo. The recoil knocks Warren back against the car and stuns him. Belle catches him before he falls.One last enforcer has to be dealt with: Rocco himself. He points his gun at Belle, poised to kill the girl-- but he, too, is out of ammo. Dropping Warren, Belle turns and runs as Rocco chases her down. But at an intersection, just as Rocco runs through it, a mere few meters behind Belle, he's run down by Stansfield, arriving on the scene to make the final save. Belle collapses to her hands and knees on the street and sobs, as Warren comes to, comes up behind his sister, and holds her.Maggie is at the wheel of the Manzoni car as they drive through the late night to their next home. Fred is pleased with himself; he's fixed the brown water problem, was a hit for one night at Cholong-sur-Avre's film society, and he believes his family is more close-knit than anything. The bounty on his head is probably double what it was before, but the only real bummer to him is that he has to rewrite his memoirs from the start, and they have to change their names again."

Carrie,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1939659/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A shy girl, outcast by her peers and sheltered by her religious mother, unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far at her senior prom. The outcast teenager Carrie White is bullied by her classmates at high school. Her mother, Margaret White, is a pious and paranoid woman that sees sin everywhere and the need of self-inflicting punishment. When Carrie has her first period, she does not understand what is happening to her and her classmates humiliate her in the changing room. The spiteful Chris Hargensen videotapes Carrie with her cellphone and posts it on the Internet.

Her mother Margaret (Julianne Moore) is a Christian zealot prone to locking her in a small broom closet and making her pray for hours on end. All Carrie wants is to fit in, but after the shock of experiencing her first period in the gym shower results in a devastating bout of bullying initiated by cruel Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) and her circle of friends, the young outcast realizes that she has the ability to move objects with the power of her mind alone. Meanwhile, as gym teacher Miss Desjardin (Judy Greer) bans Chris from the prom following a defiant outburst by the entitled teen, Chris' best friend Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) begins having second thoughts about the way that Carrie has been treated. In an attempt to atone for her past misdeeds, Sue convinces her lacrosse-star boyfriend Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to ask Carrie to the prom -- an invitation that she eventually accepts. But Chris isn't finished with Carrie just yet, and later, when a cruel prank at the prom goes horribly awry, Carrie puts her newfound telekinetic powers to terrifying use.. 17-year-old Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a lonely girl targeted for ruthless abuse, not only from her bullying classmates - led by Christine Hargensen (Portia Doubleday), but also from her narcissistic and fanatically religious mother at home (Julianne Moore). After a nasty incident at school involving her first period, her gym teacher, Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer) sticks up for Carrie and punishes the bullies. Chris gets herself suspended for fighting the punishment and begins plotting revenge against Carrie. Meanwhile, Carrie is beginning to discover she has great telekinetic powers. Chris's former best friend, Sue (Gabriella Wilde) asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to senior prom, which he does. Unknown to him or Carrie, though, Chris and her boyfriend have a humiliating prank planned, with help from Chris's girlfriends. When the prank is carried out, a horrible fate awaits Carrie's tormentors as the doors seal shut and a fire breaks out. Only a handful of the senior class will live to graduate.—medic249a2 In the opening scene, set in the year 1995, there is the White household where we hear Margaret White (Julianne Moore) screaming in pain. The shot pans the upstairs floor where Margaret is crying out to God in agony. We see a puddle of water that has splattered a Bible and numerous droplets of blood. Margaret is writhing on the bed in agony thinking she has been afflicted with a cancer, and begs for God's mercy as she is taken. Her body contorts a few times as she screams and she looks up waiting to die. But she doesn't. She realizes she is still alive and there is something underneath her nightdress. She looks between her legs and finds a baby. She had been pregnant and didn't know it. Margaret nods. ""It's a test,"" she says, and reaches for scissors, ready to slay her newborn daughter. She almost stabs the baby, when something stops her at the last second. She puts the scissors down and cradles her newborn daughter.Cut to present day. Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz), now age 17 or 18, is a meek, shy young girl at her high school located in the small town of Castle Rock, Maine. Considered an outcast by everyone, she sneaks into the background hoping she will not be noticed. During P.E. class, during the gym game of water volleyball, the ball lands in front of her and she is asked to serve the ball. She accidentally hits Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) in the head which makes everyone, including Carrie, laugh. Sue's friend, Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) tells Carrie, ""you eat shit"", so everyone starts laughing at her instead.After gym, Carrie starts to take a shower alone when she notices blood. She races to the girls for help, not understanding what is going on. The girls, led by Chris, realize Carrie is having her first period and doesn't understand it. Instead of helping, they throw tampons at her and chant: ""plug it up."" Chris even films it on her iPhone. Even Sue joins in with the chanting and taunting, but stops halfway through, ashamed of what she is doing. The gym teacher, Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer) overhears them and in an effort to calm her down, slaps Carrie to keep her from screaming. Ms. Desjardin yells for everyone to get out. As the girls file out, a light shatters. Sue looks at Carrie with deep regret and guilt.Carrie is taken to the principal's office with Ms. Desjardin as they try to explain what has happened (with the principal, Henry Grayle, severely uncomfortable with it). He tells Ms. Desjardin to handle the punishment of the girls that participated in the incident. The principal and Ms. Desjardin tell Carrie that they have called her mother to pick her up. Carrie goes completely white, begging them not to call her mom. Principal Grayle says they know the school has problems with her mother since the state disallowed her mother to home school Carrie, but Ms. Desjardin reassures her and says it will be okay. Carrie starts hyperventilating and a nearby water cooler shatters. Carrie leaves the office.Margaret comes to pick up Carrie. Nearby, Sue, Chris and her rough boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell) sit. Chris shows everyone the video of Carrie, who sees what Chris & the others are doing. Sue looks on at Carrie, and her face betrays more guilt.On the way home Carrie apologizes to her mother for making her come to school.When they get home, Carrie wants to talk to Margaret about why she didn't explain to her about her period. ""I thought I was dying,"" Carrie says. Margaret is evasive and tells her to come inside. Carrie tells her mother she won't; she wants to talk about what happened. As Carrie sits in the car, a local boy rides around it on his bicycle and calls her ""Crazy Carrie."" Carrie apparently uses her powers to makes him fall off his bike, which scares him into fleeing.Inside the house, Carrie finds her mother banging her head on the wall. Carrie tells her to stop and just talk to her. Margaret, however, is more concerned with praying for forgiveness and creates her own bible verses on a whim to suit her needs. Carrie recognizes these 'verses' are not even real Bible verses and objects to her mother's prayers, but Margaret knocks her in the head with a bible. As their argument heads downstairs to the kitchen, Margaret calls her a sinner. ""I did not sin,"" Carrie says. Margaret opens the ""Prayer Closet"" and tells Carrie to get in. Carrie refuses so her mother throws her in and latches the door, telling her to pray for forgiveness. Carrie bangs on the door, begging to be let out. ""GOD, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"" Carrie screams, and then suddenly a crack is formed through the middle of the door to both their surprise. Carrie looks at a sculpture hanging on the wall of Jesus nailed to the cross. It begins to bleed to her horror.Meanwhile, Sue and her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) are having sex in a jeep, though Sue's mind is somewhere else. They get dressed, and Sue talks about her guilt about what happened to Carrie and how she initially helped. Tommy relates he once beat a bully that had tormented him. He says the guy had it coming. ""What did Carrie White ever do you?"" Tommy asks.At the same time, Chris and Billy, along with another girlfriend, named Tina, hang out at her house. Chris is unrepentant about what she has done, and on a whim, decides to upload the video to YouTube, humiliating Carrie even further.Back at the White household, Margaret is making clothes and singing Bible songs. She eventually opens the closet and finds Carrie sleeping. She wakes her up and asks if she said her prayers. Carrie says yes, and Margaret becomes a loving mother again. They exchange 'I love you""s.The next day, Ms. Desjardin lays down the law with Chris, Sue, and all the other girls that participated in Carries shaming. Ms. Desjardin asks about Chris and Sue's dates for the prom and tells Sue she would've voted her Prom Queen but not anymore. Ms. Desjardin tells them it was a ""very shitty"" thing they did to Carrie and they are going to pay for it. She also mentions that apparently someone took a video of the incident, looking at Chris as she is pretty sure that she is the one who did it. They will be doing suicide sprints after school for a week. Anyone who refuses the punishment is suspended and cannot go to prom. ""While you run, I want you to think long and hard about what it would be like to be Carrie White,"" Ms. Desjardin says.After a while, Chris calls ""bullshit"" on the whole punishment, saying Ms. Desjardin can't do it. Sue tries to tell her to take the punishment and let it go but she won't. Chris refuses, so Ms. Desjardin suspends her and revokes her prom privileges. Chris says Ms. Desjardin can't take away prom from her and tries to rally the other girls to go with her. One by one, they refuse, including Sue, the only one who shows any true remorse. They continue to run while Chris screams: ""This is not over!""Meanwhile, everyone snickers at Carrie, having seen the video. As Carrie walks down the hall, humiliated, she stares in disgust at graffiti that someone has sprayed across a bank of lockers saying, 'Carrie White eats shit'. She goes in the bathroom and concentrates on the mirror. After a moment, she is able to smash it to her shock. Looking at the pieces she makes them levitate for a moment until another girl shows up. Carrie grabs her bag and leaves.Carrie goes to the library and looks to the web and numerous books about telekinesis. After seeing a video about telekinesis, she decides to test her own abilities with it in subtle ways. In class, Carrie looks at the flag outside the window, and makes it move. She smiles with a sense of accomplishment.Carrie is called to the front of the class and reads a favorite poem. It is quite dark, but well written and people pay attention to her. The teacher, Mr. Ullman, is amazed she has talked at all, and asked if she has something else to say after scaring the classroom. ""You asshole,"" Tommy mutters under his breath. The teacher asks what he said. Tommy said the poem was ""awesome"" and asks the teacher if he thought the same thing. Carrie looks at Tommy shyly and smiles.Meanwhile, Margaret is seen working at a dry cleaner/seamstress store. Someone calls out for help and it turns out to be Eleanor Snell, Sue's mother. She is picking up Sue's prom dress. Mrs. Snell tries to apologize for Sue's behavior and commends Margaret on the work she did. Meanwhile, Margaret is cutting herself on the leg with a needle, making herself bleed. ""These are godless times,"" Margaret says before returning to her work.Chris gets a meeting with Ms. Desjardin and Principal Grayle with her arrogant lawyer father to try and overturn her suspension and revoked prom privileges. Chris tries to play the victim, but Ms. Desjardin plays better hardball than her, saying there was a video uploaded and if Chris just proves it isn't on her phone, then she will get an apology and be allowed to go to prom. Her father tells her to give up the phone, but Chris refuses to and storms out, thus indirectly admitting her complicity and making sure her suspension and punishment stay active.Sue and the prom committee work on turning the gymnasium into the prom. Chris storms in, angrily telling her friends that she is banned from prom, and asks why the girls didn't back her up. She then asks why Sue didn't. Sue says because she deserved the punishment, they all did. Ms. Desjardin was right; they did a shitty thing to Carrie. Chris balks and says Carrie deserved it. ""What has Carrie White ever done to you?"" Sue asks her soon to be former friend. Chris tells Sue that she is not being high and mighty because she feels bad; it's because she wants to go to prom with Tommy then have sex with him in the hotel she already booked. ""You don't give a shit about Carrie White,"" Chris sneers, leaving.We see Sue at home, looking at her prom dress lovingly.Back at the White household, Carrie is in her room making books move, testing her powers. She eventually makes several levitate including her bed. Margaret hears the noise and takes a butcher knife to investigate. When she gets to Carrie's room, Carrie has fooled her, turning out the lights. Margaret puts the knife down and says she will never let anyone hurt her little girl. Carrie then accidentally causes the knife to stick into the floor, shocking Margaret.The next day, Sue watches Tommy play lacrosse. Sue comes up to Tommy and asks for a favor; she wants him to take Carrie to the prom. Tommy is shocked, saying he wants to take her, but Sue wants to do something to make up for the humiliation Carrie was put through. ""I'm trying to fix what I did,"" she says. Tommy tries to convince her, but Sue says she can't go and begs him to help her make things right.Tommy finds Carrie at lunch and shocks her by talking to her. Tommy asks her about prom and if she would like to go with him. Carrie runs off without responding. Tommy tracks her down and asks again, but Carrie thinks it is a joke. ""Stop trying to trick me,"" Carrie says. ""I'm not,"" Tommy replies. Carrie doesn't believe him however, and runs off.Carrie is crying in the locker room and is discovered by Ms. Desjardin. Ms. Desjardin thinks the girls did something again but Carrie says she got invited to prom. Ms. Desjardin says that's a happy thing and asks who asked her. Carrie says Tommy Ross. Ms. Desjardin, realizing something is up, stays neutral saying he is a cute boy. Carrie says she knows he dates Sue Snell and thinks this a big joke to him. ""They're going to trick me again,"" Carrie says. Ms. Desjardin says maybe not. Carrie ponders why Tommy would want to go with her. Ms. Desjardin directs Carrie to the mirror telling her she sees a beautiful girl and with the right dress and the tiniest dash of makeup she can stun everyone speechless.Ms. Desjardin confronts Sue and Tommy thinking they are planning something. ""If the two of you are planning some kind of joke on a poor, lonely, defenseless girl..."" Ms. Desjardin warns them. However, Sue says she is trying to do a good thing for Carrie; allow her one good night and a chance to be social. Tommy says it doesn't matter since Carrie said no, but Sue tells him to try again. Ms. Desjardin tries to appeal to Tommy saying he will look 'ridiculous' with Carrie on his arm, but Sue says this is a private matter and they don't care how they look doing it.Tommy drives over to Carrie's house and tells her he is not leaving till she says yes to prom. Fearful her mother will see them, Carrie says yes but that she will have to be home by 10:30 pm. Tommy says he will pick her up at 7:00 pm. Carrie smiles.Carrie goes into town and sees a dress shop. She looks at one in the store front and her body reflected onto it. Going inside, she sees that they are too pricey for what she can afford. She sees some fabric and stares at awe at the potential. From across the street, Chris and her friends see Carrie at the store and Chris seethes in rage. It is at this time that Chris begins to plot revenge against Carrie for what Chris sees as getting her banned from prom, and apparently enlists the help of her friends Tina, twins Nicki & Lizzy, and Heather.That evening, Carrie walks home seeing her mom waiting for her in the front yard. Margaret is livid since she didn't know where she was. Carrie says she went into town to buy fabric to make herself a gown. Margaret says she is not allowed to go anywhere but school and home. Carrie then tells her the news; she's been asked to prom. Carrie tells her that she knows she is scared and she is too. However, the kids laugh at her and think she is weird. She doesn't want to be weird; she wants to be normal and thinks prom may be her final chance. ""I have to try and be a whole person before it is too late,"" Carrie says. Margaret is livid and tells her to go to her closet and repent before it is too late. Carrie asks why she can't be happy for her. But the insane Margaret refuses to listen and orders Carrie to go to her closet. Carrie then has an episode and makes everything in the living room jump up. Margaret falls to the floor in shock and starts to pray. Carrie tells her mom to get up and when she doesn't, she raises her with her powers. Margaret calls Carrie a devil, but Carrie says she has powers and others have them too. Carrie states that her grandmother may have had them and it's possible that they skipped a generation to Carrie. Carrie places her mother down and her mother says she thought she was a cancer when she was born. Carrie tells her that is a horrible thing to say and levitates her again. She tells her she is going to prom, she will not stop her, and they are not talking about it anymore. Carrie then releases her.Meanwhile, Chris, Billy and a few others are at a pig farm. Billy callously crushes a pig's head and Chris slits the throat to collect the blood.The next day, Sue is working on the prom decorations when she feels sick. She runs to the bathroom and throws up. Shock hits her face; she thinks she is pregnant.We see Carrie make her prom dress. Chris and Billy break into the gymnasium and rig the pail with the pig blood. Billy tells Chris she can drop it on Carrie, and Chris states she has every intention of doing so.Sue puts her dress away, committing to her decision.We see a montage of the students get ready and dressed for prom. We see Carrie put her dress on and apply some light makeup. She has fully transformed herself into the beautiful woman she was meant to be.Margaret tells her she looks like a deviant. Carrie, having enough of her mother's overly religious quotes, asks that for once that her mom could be happy for her. Margaret says they are going to laugh at her, but Carrie says to stop it. Tommy is a nice boy and everything is going to be fine. As Tommy shows up, Margaret tells her daughter that she was conceived by what was basically marital rape and how she tried to kill her as a baby. Carrie, finally losing all her patience, force-chokes her mom. ""There will be a judgment Carrie"", Margaret says. Carrie opens the closet and locks her mother in with her powers, saying she will be back at 10:30 pm as promised. She then melts the door lock so her mother can't get out.Carrie goes outside to meet Tommy. ""Do I look okay?"" Carrie asks. ""You look beautiful,"" Tommy says, meaning it.They drive to prom in a limo. Carrie requests a moment, thinking about the other students. Tommy tells her despite what she thinks they aren't all bad. Calming her down, they go in, where she is introduced to Tommy's best friend and his girlfriend, who goes to another school. The other girl compliments Carrie on her dress, and is pleasantly surprised to find out that Carrie made it herself.Carrie begins to loosen up. Tommy asks if she wants to dance but they agree to wait till a slow one comes on, after Carrie sees some wild dance moves from another student and isn't sure what to make of them. Ms. Desjardin sees Carrie and tells her how beautiful she looks. While they talk, Tommy texts Sue, telling her that everything is okay, Carrie is enjoying herself and that he misses her. Sue smiles, content that she is making it right.A slow song comes on and Tommy convinces Carrie to dance with him. He teaches her how to slow dance and she quickly learns. Carrie puts her head on his shoulder then backs away. Something crosses Tommy's face when that happens; while he is still obviously loyal to Sue, he is starting to grow some feelings for Carrie due to her being such a sweet person. Carrie, still unsure about his intentions asks why he asked her to prom. Tommy says that he wanted to, and is having a good time with her and hopes she is feeling the same way. Carrie nods yes. Tommy then says they will enjoy their time here then they can go to an after party and he will have back home on time. Carrie smiles, agrees, and notes that she can maybe stay out till 11.Thanks to Chris's friend Tina, Billy and Chris break into the prom and sit in the rafters waiting. They hand off ballots to Tina's date, Greg Delois, who switches them out to rig the Prom King and Queen election to ensure Carrie & Tommy are elected.The voting for Prom King and Queen begins. Carrie questions voting for herself but Tommy tells her there isn't much to it, and she should have one chance to be in the spotlight. Carrie notes that the crowns are beautiful. ""The Devil with false modesty,"" Tommy says. Carrie is convinced so they vote for themselves. Meanwhile, Chris's friends switch out the ballots to rig them in Tommy and Carrie's favor.Chris texts on her cell phone to Sue while Sue is getting out of the shower. She says ""Your girl looks good. She won't for long."" Horror washes over Sue's face; she knew Chris was vindictive but not to this extent. Sue realizes that Chris has planned something horrifying to humiliate Carrie, and races to prom to try to stop her.Chris seems to have second thoughts for a moment. Billy reminds her that what they are doing is criminal assault, and they need to flee the second they are done.Meanwhile, Sue gets to the building but can't get in. She sees someone open the door and sneaks in.The ""ballots"" are counted. Tommy and Carrie win. Carrie is stunned but happy. They walk up to the podium with everyone applauding. Ms. Desjardin, Mr. Ullman, and Principal Grayle are especially happy for Carrie, glad to see that she has finally got her moment in the sun.Sue looks around and sees Chris in the rafters. Chris sees Sue looking at her. She hesitates momentarily, but Billy goads her on to pull the rope. Ms. Desjardin sees Sue and misconstrues her reasons for being there and throws her out of the building without hearing her warning.Chris pulls the rope. Although the rope jams and forces Chris to pull on it several times, it eventually gives way and the pig blood cascades down and drowns Carrie in it. Complete and utter silence follows. ""WHAT THE HELL?!"" Tommy yells at everyone, having and wanting no part in this unbelievable act of cruelty. Chris has hacked the video monitors, and using her iPhone, plays Carrie's period video. Most of the class laughs, but Ms. Desjardin, along with a few others, are in complete shock. Ms. Desjardin goes to Carrie but Carrie pushes her back with her powers, startling everyone.Chris and Billy rig the rope and begin to flee but Chris wants to stick around and see Carrie squirm. The rope, however, gives way and the pail that held the blood cracks Tommy on the back of the head, killing him instantly. Carrie turns back around and cradles his head in her lap, absolutely devastated that the only boy that ever treated her kindly has been killed. Carrie looks up in the rafters and recognizes Billy's sunglasses. She knows who is responsible. Something snaps in her mind. She turns to the guests, as the blood on her body starts to levitate off it. A few see this and try to flee in horror but it is no use.Carrie finally loses control and violently force-pushes the entire crowd back, people hitting tables and each other. She then slams all the doors of the gym shut and locks them, so no one can get out. One of the girls, Heather, is force-thrown across the room and has her head smashed into a closed door. Tina's date, Greg Delois, and a few other guys try to escape by climbing the bleachers, but Carrie collapses them, gorily crushing Greg to death. As a boy films her, she throws a table at him, the force of the hit killing him. Carrie then trips the sprinklers leaving the whole room soaked in water. As she sees the twin girls Nicki and Lizzy, friends of Chris, trying to flee, she forces-pushes them to the ground where they are trampled to death by the fleeing mob. Behind Carrie on the stage, a light fixture drops from the ceiling, touching off a fire on the stage and exposing several live electrical cables. Seeing Chris's friend Tina attempting to escape, Carrie force-throws a burning decoration at her but misses. Carrie then uses the live electrical cables to torture Tina, driving her back towards a smaller fire burning on the floor. The hem of the dress comes in contact with the fire, and in seconds the flames have engulfed the dress, causing Tina to burn to death. As flames envelop the room, Ms. Desjardin tries to calm Carrie down but Carrie grabs her in a Darth Vader-like force-choke hold and pulls her up, holding her for a moment above the floor that has become electrified as the electrical cables come in contact with the water from the sprinklers. However, her reasoning returns momentarily and she spares Ms. Desjardin, pulling her across to the stage, as she was one of the few people that were ever nice to her. Carrie then levitates herself out of the building as Ms. Desjardin and the few remaining students watch in horror and shock.By now the entire school is in flames. While people some escape, many don't. Carrie sees Chris and Billy's red car. Her rage returns.Chris asks Billy what they should do as their little prank is now responsible for at least a dozen deaths. Billy tells her they will leave town and never come back. Chris agrees reluctantly. As they drive off, Carrie is behind them. She stomps the ground and causes it to cave out ahead. Billy turns the car around and speeds back. Chris sees Carrie and despite everything, will not give up her vendetta. ""RUN HER DOWN. KILL HER!"" Chris snarls. Billy says he has it under control and charges Carrie. Carrie however is waiting for him and stops the car with her power, the force causing Billy to hit the steering wheel hard, breaking his nose, and causing his head to violently snap back and kill him instantly. Chris comes to a few minutes later, and realizes Billy is dead from the impact. She cries but when she sees Carrie, she reaches for the keys and backs up, still hell-bent on killing her. When she charges again, Carrie pulls the car's back wheels up high in the air, and then throws the vehicle into a gas station pump. The force of the throw causes Chris's face to go through the windshield making shards of glass embed all around her face. Carrie watches as Chris breathes her last breath. As an extra precaution and because Chris deserved it, Carrie causes a power pole to spark and collapse, igniting the leaking gasoline and causing an explosion that guarantees Billy's and Chris's deaths.Back at the burned gym, Sue sees Ms. Desjardin and they both sob at the destruction.Carrie begins to walk home, destroying everything in her path. When she gets inside, she sees her mom had forced a hole from the crack in the door and has escaped from the closet. Carrie calls out to her but gets no response. Her mother is hiding in the shadows.Carrie gets into the bathtub and cleans off all the blood, changing into a blue nightgown. She finds Margaret and tells her she was right about everything. They hug and Margaret suggests they pray. As they pray, Margaret takes her butcher knife and stabs Carrie once in the back. Carrie then pushes her mother back as she falls down the stairs. Their fight continues in the kitchen as Carrie begs her mother to stop what she is doing. ""You know a devil never dies. You gotta keep killing it,"" Margaret says, manic. They struggle and she slices Carrie on the leg and arm. When she tries to stab Carrie in the face, Carrie stops the blade with her powers and then pulls up numerous sharp objects and points them in her mother's direction. Telling her she is sorry, Carrie lets them fly, and they impale her mother to the wall as if in a crucifix-like pose.Carrie, horrified by what she is done, releases the blades that pin her mother to the wall. Margaret dies moments later in Carrie's lap. Carrie cries at the loss.Moments later, Sue arrives at the house. Carrie is angry with her saying she just killed her mother and she wants her back. ""Why couldn't you leave me alone?"" Carrie asks. Sue says she tried to help her. Carrie puts Sue in a force choke-hold as the house begins to collapse around them due to her powers becoming uncontrollable. ""Don't hurt me Carrie,"" Sue pleads. ""Why not?"" Carrie snarls. Then, Carrie puts Sue down. Sue tries to reach for Carrie so they can escape. Carrie places her hand near Sue's stomach. ""It's a girl,"" Carrie says. Sue looks at her in shock. ""You don't know?"" Carrie asks. Carrie pushes her out of the house. Sue watches as rocks come out of nowhere and fall directly on the house, collapsing it on itself. Carrie holds her mother and kisses her forehead as the house finally falls down on the both of them. Sue looks on in horror and gingerly touches her stomach.An undisclosed time later, Sue is giving a deposition in front of the whole town (as to her pregnancy subplot, it is very unclear whether Sue is still pregnant or not and/or she kept the baby). The man interviewing her asks if what she saw happen could've been a natural accident. Sue however, stands by her story. Carrie was just a normal girl with normal hopes and desires like everyone else, and they pushed her and when people get pushed, eventually they break. They broke Carrie White.We see Sue at the graveyard where Margaret and Carrie are at a joint plot. Someone has spray painted ""CARRIE WHITE IS IN HELL"" on the gravestone with an arrow pointing down. Even in death, someone still had to be heartless to the poor, lonely girl who only wanted to be accepted. Sue lays a white rose at the grave and leaves. A moment later a force comes up from the ground, cracking the tombstone down the middle. In the middle, a crater forms in the shape of a heart. Carrie's ultimate fate is left ambiguous."

So Drayton goes into another room and shouts at Jed telling him that he has to go out there and give himself up. Just then a group of townspeaople from the town of Newt, Texas, led by Mayor Burt Hartman (Paul Rae) who have come with one thing in mind: to kill the entire family. As Drayton and the family prepare to surrender, Burt and other townspeople begin to attack by setting the house ablaze and shooting through the house. Pretty much all of the family is killed in the chaos despite Sheriff Hooper's attempts to stop them. We see Loretta Sawyer (Dodie Brown) cradling a baby, attempting to protect it, but one of the bullets flies through the windows and goes through her right shoulder and the baby's.After the chaos dies down at nighttime and the house is burned down, we see Gavin Miller (David Born) stumble upon a barely alive Loretta who is still holding on to the baby. Gavin takes the baby from her and kills Loretta by kicking her directly in the face. He runs to his wife Arlene (Sue Rock) saying that he found a baby and that they should adopt her. They decide to name the baby Heather.In the present day, adult Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario) is working in the meat section of a grocery store. She is interrupted by her friend Nikki (Tania Raymonde) who is super excited about a trip that she, Heather, Heather's boyfriend Ryan (Trey Songz), and Ryan's friend Kenny (Keram Malicki-Sánchez) are taking to New Orleans. Heather goes home to her grungy looking apartment where Ryan is sparring on a punching bag. We see that Heather has strange pieces of art that include bones and a lot of black paint. Ryan gets her to relax from being stressed about the trip by making out with her. Just as they are about to have sex they are interrupted by a knock at the door. Ryan goes to answer and gets some mail for Heather, which is a will for her. It states that her grandmother is dead and has left a house for her. However, Heather is confused because her grandparents died years ago.She goes to confront her parents who reveal to her that she was adopted. They warn her not to go to Texas, but she (completely pissed and hurt) leaves and goes back home to Ryan. When she arrives, she tells Ryan she has to go to Texas to learn more about the house and her real family. Ryan doesn't object at all and surprises her when Kenny and Nikki appear, offering to go with them.So they drive towards Texas and on the way they stop at a gas station and accidentally hit someone walking with the van. It's pouring outside, and the guy introduces himself as Darryl (Shaun Sipos). He says that to forget about them hitting him that they can just drop him off when they get to Texas, and he even offers gas money. So they figure what the hell and let him come along.When they finally reach the house they are met at the gates by Farnsworth (Richard Riehle) who gives her a keychain full of keys (one huge one in particular) and he also gives her a letter from her deceased grandmother Verna and advises her to read it IMMEDIATELY. He goes on his way, and they go through the gate.The house is STUNNING and filled with antiques. They explore the house and decide that they should get some food from a local store that may be around. Darryl offers to stay behind and set all their bags up for them, and he also gives them some money for food. They leave him at the house and go into town. After they leave, Darryl immediately starts stuffing things from inside the house into his bag. (He's obviously a thief/scam artist). He explores through the house and uses the keys to get to every door. However, he wonders what the large key goes to and goes all throughout the house until finally he stumbles upon a hidden room behind a wall. He goes into the room which leads him to a door. He uses the big key on the door and goes down into a wine cellar of some sort, and when he gets there he sees a bunch of weird items, including a plate with old rotted food sitting outside a large metal door. He tries to open the metal door various ways, but it doesn't give. As he looks for something to pry it open with, he turns back to the metal door and Leatherface (Dan Yeager) appears and strikes him over the head with a hammer (reminiscent to the scene of Kirk in the original movie). He bashes his head in repeatedly with a hammer on the floor until he is dead.While in town shopping for things, Heather is approached outside a store by Deputy Carl Hartman (Scott Eastwood), who is clearly attracted to her. Meanwhile, inside the store, we see Nikki flirting with Ryan. Ryan clearly cheated on Heather with Nikki, but blames it on them both being drunk. Nikki claims that he was begging for it. Ryan tells her to stop and forget it happened and walks away, disappointing her. Back outside, Heather tells Carl where she's staying, and the Mayor (who is Burt Hartman from earlier in the film) overhears this and asks her if she's related to the Sawyers. She lies and says no and quickly leaves with her friends.When they arrive back at the house, they see that everything is a wreck. They deduce that Darryl must have been a thief and robbed them and left. They relax since it wasn't anything extremely valuable missing and have a few drinks. Kenny (being a chef in training) starts making up some steaks as night falls. Ryan is in the study playing on the pool table, Nikki is outside smoking and eyeing Ryan from the window, and Heather is exploring the house upstairs. While Kenny is cooking, he notices the wall/door that Darryl went through, and he walks through. He calls out to Ryan, but Ryan has music playing very loud so he can't hear him. Kenny walks down into the cellar and sees Darryl's bag and a pool of blood. He calls out for Darryl, but doesn't get a response. Then when he steps into the room with the metal door, he sees the metal door is wide open. As he walks through it, he steps into a dark hallway. Suddenly, Leatherface jumps out of the darkness and chases Kenny. Kenny gets halfway up the stairs when Leatherface shoves a hook through his back. He drags him downstairs, and Kenny's screams are drowned out by the loud music.Nikki runs into the study where Ryan is playing pool. She screams and says there's something crazy he needs to see, and she looks scared. She leads him outside into a barn house in the back. When they get back there, she points to a bucket covering something. When Ryan removes the bucket he sees there is a bottle of wine and two glasses there. He turns around and is shocked to see Nikki standing half naked saying ""told you it was crazy."" She winks at him, and they proceed to have sex.Back in the house, Heather is upstairs and stumbles into a room where the corpse of Grandma Verna is sitting in a chair, decomposing. She screams and runs downstairs to find everyone, but she sees the house is empty. When she runs into the kitchen, she sees Leatherface holding a severed hand and cutting the fingers off into a bowl. She screams and catches his attention, and he grabs her and tosses her onto the kitchen floor. She hits her head and is knocked out.When she comes to, she is in a room in the cellar and we see Leatherface cutting up Darryl's body in pieces. Then we see him hang Kenny's body up on a hook and saw his body in half. Heather quickly jumps up and runs up the stairs. Leatherface chases after close behind. She falls down the front stairs when she gets outside and runs to the back of the house which is a graveyard full of the Sawyer/Carson family. She finds an unfinished grave with a coffin and climbs inside. As Leatherface stalks the graveyard, he hears Heather crying and jumps on top of the coffin and begins cutting into it.Ryan and Nikki step out of the barn house after hearing the chainsaw and they see Leatherface cutting into something. They call out to him asking who he is and when he sees them, he stops cutting into the coffin and runs toward them. They quickly run back into the barn house and barricade the door. Ryan finds a shovel and Nikki finds a loaded shotgun. She shoots through the door as Leatherface tries to cut through, she shouts ""Welcome to Texas Motherfucker!"" Suddenly it gets quiet. They see a pair of lights through the door, and the van suddenly crashes through the barn house; it's Heather. They quickly jump in and Ryan drives through the barn and towards the front gate. He tries to ram it but to no avail. As Leatherface catches up to them, Ryan backs the car up so the gate can open automatically and they drive through it. Just as they do, Leatherface manages to cut through the front tire and the side of the van. This causes the van to flip over and crash just as they get about 15 feet from him.Heather looks over, and we see Ryan is dead. (A huge piece of glass from the windshield got lodged deep into his neck). She and Nikki scream as Leatherface tries to cut through the van. He even goes so far as flipping it onto its side. Heather is able to climb out through one of the windows. Leatherface cuts Nikki on the side a little and Heather gets his attention. This distracts him, and he begins to chase Heather through the woods. She manages to reach a fence which leads to a carnival on the other side, and she hops it. Leatherface doesn't stop, and he cuts through the fence, chasing her through the carnival as people run all over, screaming. She gets to the mini ferris wheel and jumps up and grabs onto one of the seats as it lifts her up. Leatherface waits on the other side as she begins to descend back down. But just as she gets close to him, Officer Carl orders him to freeze. Leatherface tosses his chainsaw at Carl, and he ducks just in time. But this gives Leatherface enough time to escape into the woods.Carl takes Heather to the police station for questioning. There we see Sheriff Hooper waiting and when she describes Leatherface he is shocked and begins to think Jed must still be alive after all these years. She also admits that she just found she was a Sawyer. Carl pulls a box labeled ""Evidence"" and sits it on the table saying there is some crazy stuff in it about the Sawyers/Carsons. Hobbs orders Carl to leave and go look for the maniac. The mayor shows up and demands to speak with Hooper, so he leaves Heather alone while he goes to talk to him. As soon as he leaves, Heather begins to go through the evidence box that Carl pulled, and she sees how her entire family was killed without a fair trial by the townspeople and the mayor and her adoptive mom and dad. She reads about the entire incident that took place that night.Meanwhile, one of the police officers was investigating the crashed van and tells Hooper that no one is here (Nikki and Ryan's body are missing). Hooper orders him to stay at the site, but the officer sees a trail of blood that leads down the road, and he follows it. The mayor is yelling at Hooper saying that Jed cant be alive because they burned that place to the ground. The officer calls Hooper back and informs him that the blood led back to the house. The mayor orders him on the walkie to follow the blood and the officer does so. When he gets in the house, he turns on a video call of some sort so the mayor and Hobbs can see what he sees. As he follows the blood into the cellar and down a dark hallway he comes upon the room where Kenny, Darryl, and Ryan lay dead and butchered. He sees a freezer and the mayor opens him to order it. As he gets closer and closer the freezer suddenly pops open and Nikki jumps up, screaming. This shocks/scares the officer causing him to shoot Nikki in the head and accidentally kill her. The video call drops and the mayor and Hooper are shocked by what just happened. The officer runs back up the stairs of the house and is attacked by Leatherface who bludgeons him with an ax and then begins to chop into his back repeatedly. Mayor Burt decides to confront Heather saying she must have something to do with this. As Hooper tries to stop him from going into the room where she was left, they see the evidence from the night the Sawyers were killed sprawled all over the table, and Heather has written the word ""Murderers"" on one of the sheets.Back at the house, we see Leatherface crafting a new mask from the face of the police officer he just killed and he sews it onto his own face.Heather is on the streets of the town, and she reaches a payphone and calls Farnsworth. She tells him that she knows EVERYTHING, and he tells her to meet him at a local bar. When they meet he informs her that he warned her to read the letter immediately because Verna detailed everything she needed to know. He also informs her that Jed (Leatherface) knows she is still alive, but he doesn't know WHO she is. Suddenly the mayor arrives and chases her out the bar. She grabs a knife before she runs out and just as she reaches the street, the Mayor's partner, Ollie (Ritchie Montgomery), hits her with his car. He jumps out to grab her, but she quickly slashes his face with the knife and makes a run for it.Heather gets a good distance and then runs into Officer Carl. She asks him to get her to the bar, so she can help Farnsworth and warns him that the Mayor is after her. She hops in the backseat and Carl drives towards the bar. They see Farnsworth outside, and he sees them, but Carl keeps going. Heather shouts at him and then realizes he's helping the Mayor when the Mayor calls his phone. She also discovers that the Mayor is Carl's FATHER! The Mayor tells Carl over the C.B. radio to bring her to the old slaughterhouse that the Sawyers used to own. Little do they know, though, that Leatherface has a C.B. radio in a truck and overhears this. He grabs his best chainsaw and goes out into the night.Farnsworth rushes into the police station and warns Hooper that Heather is in trouble and that a police officer took her. Hooper puts a lock on the squad car's location and realizes where they're going. He quickly leaves.When Carl arrives at the slaughterhouse, he goes to tie Heather up from some ropes. When she tries to attack him, he accidentally rips her shirt down the middle, but she stays tied up. He leaves her there and tapes her mouth shut. Outside, we see the Mayor and Ollie have arrived. The Mayor tells Carl to leave and that they'll handle her. Back inside we see Leatherface is behind Heather and he places his chainsaw on her shoulder. She tries to scream, but they are muffled by the tape. He steps in front of her and revs the chainsaw. As he gets closer and closer to her with it, he stops and notices the bullet scar on her shoulder. (The same scar from when she and her mother Loretta were shot). He removes the tape from her mouth, and she begins to beg and plead with him repeatedly telling him that ""It's me! I'm Heather! I'm your cousin! Please let me go."" Leatherface is shocked by this but cuts her free, just as Ollie and the Mayor arrive and begin to beat the crap out of Leatherface. Heather makes a run for it.As soon as she gets outside, she hears Leatherface yelling out in pain as the Mayor and Ollie beat him repeatedly. The Mayor wraps a chain around his neck and tells Ollie to power it on. The chain leads into a giant meat grinder. Ollie runs to go power it on and just as he does he is attacked by Heather who shoves a pitchfork through his body and kills him. As the chain begins to pull Leatherface closer to the meat grinder, Heather shows up and tosses him his chainsaw. Leatherface uses it to cut the chain and free himself. He rises up, and Heather smirks and tells him ""Do your thing cousin."" Leatherface then cuts both of the Mayors ankles with the chainsaw. The mayor falls onto the ground and begins to crawl backwards, unknowingly towards the grinder. Hooper shows up with a gun and sees the chaos. The Mayor constantly yells for him to shoot, but Hooper slowly lowers his gun when he sees Heather shouting for him not to shoot, and he leaves the Mayor to die. The Mayor ends up crawling back into the grinder and is shredded to pieces.Back at the Sawyer house, we see Leatherface sitting slumped in a chair, and Heather is standing next to him. She tries to touch his face, but he gets up and goes down into the cellar. Heather finally reads Verna's letter which (in flashback) Verna Carson (Marilyn Burns) details that Jed is the only blood relative she has left now and that whether she chooses to stay or not, she should NEVER forget where her home is. We see Heather go down into the cellar. She stares at Leatherface face to face as she grabs his tray of old food and goes upstairs. She has decided to stay. The movie ends as Leatherface grabs the metal door, and slams it shut.In a post-credits scene, Gavin and Arlene show up at the mansion to see Heather, greedily seeking a share of her assets. As they wait by the door, Leatherface comes out with his chainsaw."
R.I.P.D.,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790736/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A cop killed by his own partner joins RIPD, an afterlife law enforcement department working to apprehend various monsters disguised as humans living on earth, and gets paired up with a smart-mouthed veteran. In Boston, the dirty cop Nick hides gold that he has stolen from drug-dealers with his partner Hayes in the backyard of his house. However, on the next morning, Nick tells Hayes that he will deliver the evidence to the police since he loves his wife Julia and he could not face her acting that way. Nick and Hayes are assigned to a raid against a dangerous gang and unexpectedly Hayes kills Nick. Nick is drawn by a tunnel and based on his previous experience in the police department, he is assigned in the afterlife by the Proctor to join the Rest in Peace Department that protects the living world from the undead and work with the old-fashioned agent Roy. Roy and Nick accidentally find that Hayes in plotting a scheme to revert the sense of the tunnel to the afterlife and bring the Apocalypse to Earth.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Nick Walker, a narcotics detective with the Boston Police Department, has just been killed in the line of duty. Rather than face judgment to determine his final resting place, Nick is recruited by Chief Mildred Proctor into the Rest in Peace Department (R.I.P.D.). Part of the reason for he ending up in this limbo of sorts is that on Earth, he and his partner, Detective Bobby Hayes, in the process of a drug raid, found a stash of gold pieces, which they took for themselves, Nick doing it solely in the want to make a better life for his wife, Julia. The limbo is also despite Nick, before his death, feeling remorse for this action and vowing to turn in his share of the gold, in the process not turning in Bobby. The mandate of the R.I.P.D. is to go back to Earth to find and destroy deados - dead people who have been able to evade judgment and are now back in human form among the living on Earth - so that they will face that judgment, ultimately sending them ""down there"" as their final resting place. Initially, Nick, learning that he will be going back to Boston, expects that he will be able to reunite with Julia and avenge his death in this job, that is until he learns that R.I.P.D. members are given new appearances and thus new identities. Nick is partnered with Roy Pulsipher, a longtime R.I.P.D. member who was a southern US Marshal during the Civil War era in his life on Earth. Judgmental Roy, who is not told of Nick's criminal actions, hopes to be able to retire soon to go to his final resting place. In the process of their work, they will discover that the gold pieces have a higher more nefarious purpose which, if in the wrong hands, could spell the end of life on Earth as it is known. As such, Nick tries to do this work while attending to his own initial goals of avenging his death and reuniting with Julia, which may not be easy considering the role of the gold pieces and with Roy and Proctor constantly looking over his dead shoulder.—Huggo Nick Walker (Ryan Reynolds) was a cop with a reputation for getting a results when he was brutally gunned down during a violent raid. The next thing Nick knew, he was sitting in the headquarters of the Rest in Peace Department -- a supernatural police force tasked with arresting lost souls who are hiding out on Earth. His new partner Roy Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges) is a veteran sheriff with a knack for spotting a fugitive soul in disguise. Now Roy and Nick are about to face a menace that threatens to upset the ethereal balance between the physical world and the supernatural realm, and should they fail in maintaining that balance, Earth will be flooded with a wave of very angry -- and very powerful -- lost souls.. Seeking redemption, Nick Walker, an otherwise conscientious Boston police detective killed in the line of duty, teams up with Roy Pulsipher, a veteran officer of the Rest In Peace Department, to track down stubborn rogue spirits refusing to cross over. However, dark forces are against them. Now, a sinister plan threatens both the supernatural police force and the fragile cosmic equilibrium between this world and the afterlife. Can the cops from beyond save the day and our souls?—Nick Riganas A monstrous, hulking like figure busts through a door after Nick Walker (Ryan Reynolds) gives a voiceover saying he's probably had a tougher day at work than the viewer. He then says the monstrous hulk isn't him. Nick and his partner chase the hulking figure into the streets, where it bounds off a truck and onto the side of a building. Standing on the side of the building, the figure taunts them. Nick aims a large revolver as he says that three or four days ago, he didn't know this kind of world existed-- but he wasn't in the RIPD.We go back to three or four days ago (Nick isn't sure which), and we see him burying several broken fragments of what appear to be golden disks, in his back yard. He plants a small orange tree sapling in the hole where he buried the gold. In the morning, he's playfully awoken by his wife Julia (Stephanie Szostak), who asks him about the tree. He plays innocent, but says it's a symbol of prosperity, and hopefully soon they can get a good house, better than the one they have now, and a good car. Julia says she's less worried about money than Nick, and having her husband waking up beside her is all she really wants.Nick arrives at work in the Boston Police Dept, greeting his partner, Bobby Hayes (Kevin Bacon). It turns out Bobby and Nick have secretly stolen the golden pieces from a previous drug bust, and nobody else in the department knows about it. Nick and Bobby planned to keep it for themselves. But Nick suddenly tells Bobby that Julia's assertion that she was happy as long as she had him, has changed his mind. Nick won't turn Bobby in, nor tell anyone he has half the gold, but Nick is going to turn his half in to evidence. He's unwilling to risk Julia's happiness on something he realizes she doesn't really need.At that moment, another officer comes up to call everyone to action; an informant has given up a whole meth operation belonging to a drug lord named Garza, and the department is mobilizing to raid the place and put him out of business. As the officers and a SWAT van ride out, Nick briefly ribs Bobby about a St. Christopher medal he wears around his left wrist, 'for protection.'The hideout is breached, but surprise lasts only a few brief seconds before Garza's men come out with all their firepower brought to bear. Nick spots Garza and pursues him up toward the roof of the building. High up on a catwalk, Nick sees Garza has slipped out a window when Bobby arrives. Bobby doesn't look very cheerful as he approaches his partner, and for good reason: he tells Nick that he can't let him turn the gold in. Bobby opens fire, his semi-automatic rifle knocking Nick off the catwalk to fall down to the ground. He lands right on his neck, which is broken by the impact.Nick's eyes open and he stands, looking around dazed. Time appears to be standing still at the moment he hit the ground. He walks around, looking at the frozen scene of the firefight going on, and outside a breached gate where an explosion has a squad car and several officers frozen still in mid air. Nick's attention is caught by a strange whirlpool like formation among the clouds, and his feet lift off the ground, and he's rising ino the air, higher and higher, and into the whirlpool. He flies up through a surreal vision, one of many countless human figures in a stream toward a hole high above. But then he's pulled sideways, landing in a stark white room, seated in a desk chair before a desk. Sitting behind the desk is an attractive dark-haired woman (Mary-Louise Parker) who watches him with a slightly amused expression. The name Proctor is on a name sign on her desk.Proctor tells Nick that she's here to help him, and she understands what he's feeling right now because she's sat in the same chair he's sitting in. Nick was heading toward Judgement, and Proctor assures him that he could probably use a good word and recommendation, especially after having stolen the gold. Proctor's offer: she's a chief for the RIPD, or Rest In Peace Department. Some people 'slip through the cracks' (Earth's population has grown so large that more people die every day than 'the system' can handle) after dying and remain among the living; this rots their soul, although they continue appearing as normal humans to the living. The RIPD's job is to find these 'deados,' as Proctor calls them, and round them up. Nick must serve among the RIPD for 100 Earth years, and will be operating back in Boston. Nick promptly volunteers to do what he's being asked to do, but Proctor shows she's not so easily fooled; she has a thorough 'case file' on Nick's life, and he wouldn't be sent back to be with Julia again.Proctor takes Nick into the main room for Boston's RIPD 'precinct,' manned by officers from many different times, always adapting to Earth's ever-changing society. Nick's first task is to meet his new partner-- a trigger-happy, rough as sandpaper, wise-talking 'lawman' with an attitude, named Roysephus 'Roy' Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges)... who doesn't like having to have a partner. Seeing that Proctor isn't giving him any options, Roy tells Nick to come with him. A bathroom in the department leads them (when the 'toilet' is flushed) into the bathroom of a VCR repair shop on a Boston street. Their car has the shop's logo on it, as a cover identity. Roy tells Nick that Proctor wants to start Nick off 'with some closure.'This closure, for Nick, means watching his own funeral. He's given a full 21-gun salute, a flag draped over his coffin and then folded up and given to Julia, as she cries softly. But Nick gets angry when he sees the partner who betrayed and killed him, Bobby Hayes, go up to Julia and hug her. Roy doesn't try to stop Nick as he starts running off the hill he's standing on, and into the dispersing funeral crowd to try and talk to Julia.Nick reaches Julia, only to find that she doesn't recognize him. Bobby hurries up, aggressively protecting Julia from Nick, and also apparently not recognizing him. Boston officers grab Nick and keep him away as Bobby protectively gets Julia into a car and they ride away.Roy is waiting for Nick's return, and then explains that he no longer looks like Nick Walker, nor has the same voice. His words will come out jumbled and garbled if he tries to tell anyone who knew Nick, that it's him. The higher powers of the universe don't allow RIPD officers to reveal who they are to anyone that used to know them. Roy hands Nick a set of ID's that allow him access to various private places. The ID's show what he looks like to the living: Nick appears as an elderly Chinese man named Jerry Chen (James Hong). As for Roy-- the living see him as a sexy female blonde bombshell (Marisa Miller). Only to other RIPD do they appear as their former selves.As they drive through the streets of Boston, Nick learns one of the reasons for Roy's dislike of having a partner-- like Nick, Roy was betrayed and murdered by his Earthly partner. He was a Marshall in the 1800's and has been in the RIPD since then. Roy also re-iterates that Nick needs to remember that his wife is now a widow and he can't have her back.They arrive at a building where Roy has heard a deado is hiding in. He explains that a deado's rotting soul infects everything around them, and that anything broken is a strong sign of a deado's presence, such as a broken elevator and signal light. Roy hands Nick a special clip for the gun Proctor gave him; as Roy explains, Earthly weapons are useless against deados. The special handcuffs given Nick are the only way to subdue a deado, and if they are unable to bring one in alive and must defend themselves, the 'soul eraser' bullets will disperse a deado soul if they're struck in the head with them, causing the deado to be ""erased"" and cease to exist. RIPD can also be erased and cease to exist if struck by such bullets, as Roy cautions Nick.Roy finds his way to an apartment door beside a flickering wall light and a moldy wall. The door is answered by a meek, wimpy-looking man who Roy addresses as Stanley Nawicki (Robert Knepper). Roy flashes his Department of Health ID to get in. Nawicki looks hopelessly confused as Roy has Nick read a question off a card, on whether he'd accept a plate of chicken vindaloo from a teenager on an Ash Wednesday. Roy opens a container of take-out Indian food and makes like he's starting to eat it. Nawicki starts to look ill as Roy does this. Roy makes Nick read off more crazy-sounding questions, but all including the name of a dish from Indian cuisine. Nawicki continues acting more odd and more ill as this happens. When Roy starts exclaiming the name of one of the dishes loudly, some of the food spills from his mouth onto the table right in front of Nawicki, who reacts, revealing his rotted deado nature, with a humongous mouth (Roy says he was a snitch in life). Apparently cumin, a spice in Indian food, forces a deado to reveal itself.But as Nick starts to place the deado cuffs on Nawicki, he pulls off the refrigerator door and wields it as a weapon. Nick fastens the other cuff around his own wrist, so Nawicki pulls off his cuffed arm and grabs a container of milk from the fridge as he runs. He swallows the contents before jumping through the building window. Roy charges at Nick, pushing him through and falling after, and on top, of him. They land on top of Nawicki and corner him. When Nawicki mocks Nick over one of Roy's wise-cracks, Nick beats Nawicki silly with the arm he pulled off, causing Nawicki to regurgitate what he'd swallowed-- several chunks of gold looking just like the ones Nick and Bobby found during the Earthly drug bust. When Nick starts examining these chunks, Nawicki suddenly attacks him, and is erased by Roy.Nick is absorbed in the gold chunks as Roy yakety-yaks about Nick's 'grade' during the bust. Losing his patience, Nick grabs Roy and throws him in front of a bus, which runs him over. This can't harm Roy, like the jump out the window couldn't, but Roy's hat is blown off into the wind, which pisses him off royally.Back at HQ, they note that officers are mobilizing for a surge in deado presence in Boston. Nick, however, is still concerned about the gold, even as it's placed in a storage vault in evidence. Nick knows that Nawicki was trying very hard to protect and hide it, and he's sure that means something that should be followed up on. He's sure that a long-time RIPD veteran like Roy will have a deado informant that can help with the investigation.Roy's informant is named Elliot (Mike O'Malley), and he's a huge Red Sox fan who works in Fenway Park. Roy takes him there and busies himself trying on spare hats Elliot has while Nick questions him about the gold. Elliot seems more interested in mocking Nick and the RIPD in general, but gives in when Nick gets rough. Unfortunately, Elliot insists he really knows nothing about the gold, saying that deados are sentimental and that's why they tend to care about useless things, including what Elliot calls 'talismanic junk.' Nick tosses the chunk of gold to Elliot and tells him to keep his ears open.Nick knows, of course, that Elliot was still lying, and let him keep the gold for a reason. Sure enough, Elliot sneaks out of the stadium and waits with shifty eyes. Even Roy is impressed as he and Nick watch Bobby drive up, and Elliot gives him the gold. Roy and Nick follow Bobby, watching him drive... to Nick's house. Nick is sure, however, that Bobby isn't taking Julia for himself. Hiding, they eavesdrop as Bobby questions Julia about whether Nick seemed okay to her the day he died. Confiding in her that Nick claimed to have buried something, Bobby learns about the orange tree and digs up the gold Nick hid there, letting Julia think Nick stole it. Bobby promises that no heat will come down on Julia for this.Roy grills Nick about his apparently being a dirty cop. It escalates into Nick hitting Roy, but that stops when Bobby puts the gold in the trunk of his car and prepares to drive off. They follow him again and watch as he enters a commercial building and sits down on a public bench. As they wait, Roy schools Nick on more post-death recovery, pointing out that he's far from the only one who now has regrets (Nick knows Julia doesn't know what to think of him right now), and Roy, like Nick, can't resolve them himself, so they all have to learn to live with it.A dog starts barking, which alerts Roy. The dog is agitated at a stout man with dark shades, a tan suit, long sideburns, and a short goatee. Roy knows the man is a deado, and Nick is sure that Bobby is here to meet with him. Bobby hands a briefcase to the deado, which contains the gold. Roy and Nick follow him, grab him and push him through a kitchen into a freezer, grabbing some cumin powder from a shelf. The deado, Pulaski (Devin Ratray), sees Roy and Nick as Jerry Chen and the blonde bombshell, but knows they're RIPD. When Nick shakes some cumin into his hand, offering to 'pop' Pulaski and reveal him, Pulaski grabs Nick's hand and inhales the powder deeply. Roy and Nick watch as Pulaski is revealed as the hulking figure they chase in the beginning of the movie. As Pulaski lands on the building wall and mocks them, Roy attaches a harpoon extension to his soul eraser gun, but Pulaski still proves a tenacious target to take down, dragging Roy along on a zany chase scene across the city scape; a multi-vehicle smash-up resulting when a truck driver sees the blonde bombshell swinging from some cable through the air. Nick fires at Pulaski, who shields his head with the briefcase, leaping up onto a roof. When Roy is still holding on to the harpoon, Pulaski smashes through a window into a corporate board room and rips open the elevator doors. Nick and Roy converge there, Nick shooting the elevator cable so its counterweight yanks it upward. The elevator crashes through the roof of the office building and is wrecked atop it. Nick and Roy recover the gold, but Pulaski escapes, creating more mayhem as he goes.Back at HQ, Proctor, now furious, berates Roy and Nick for allowing a deado to be seen by the living, not to mention the amount of destruction to city property resulted by the bungled arrest. Proctor doesn't care about the gold, only about the failure to contain, that resulted in an exposed deado running loose in Boston in the middle of the day, which is now all over Boston TV. Proctor marches Roy and Nick into a room where a container drops down from a golden-colored chute pipe reaching as far, far up as they can see-- RIPD's ""Eternal Affairs."" Proctor takes the container and opens it. But as she reads the proclamation, she suddenly appears quite chaste. Although Eternal Affairs is pretty angry at Pulaski's revelation and escape, the proclamation says that the golden chunks recovered by Roy and Nick are components of an extremely dangerous artifact known as the Staff of Jericho. As Proctor explains, the cloud tunnel that Nick was rising through when he died, before he was pulled into Proctor's office, is a one-way tunnel to the afterlife. The Staff of Jericho can reverse the flow of deceased humans, bringing them all back down to Earth, eventually causing the Apocalypse. Aside from the golden components, the artifact requires 'the blood of thine enemy' (human blood) to power it up.Another container drops down from the chute. Proctor reads it and looks unhappy. Eternal Affairs is suspending Nick and Roy from the case, even though recovery of all the artifact components is now red alert priority for the whole RIPD worldwide. A hearing is scheduled for tomorrow, and the chances are high that Roy and Nick will both be erased. Sullen at this verdict, Nick walks away, saying he has somewhere more important to be.Nick goes to a track where he knows Julia still goes to run many evenings. Although he still appears as Jerry Chen to Julia, she recognizes this elderly man from the cemetery and stops, wanting to know why he's following her. Nick walks up to Julia and touches her chin with his forefinger and thumb in a way that makes her smile without realizing it. Snapping herself out of this trance, Julia tells Chen to stay away from her and resumes running.Roy is at the track, telling Nick that trying to say another goodbye to Julia isn't helping. Whether or not they get erased, Julia must live on as a widow, and find her own closure. Roy tells Nick he must do the same. This only makes Nick upset and an argument results in Nick insulting Roy pretty close to home.On a pier, Nick and Roy make peace, and Nick decides he's not taking this lying down; suspension or not, he intends to stop Bobby and the threatened apocalypse, which Roy admits paints him into a corner on whether to take part.Nick and Roy know that Bobby is more than a bagman in the whole deado operation to restore the artifact. He's a major operative, and most likely, a deado himself. What bugs Nick is that he was partners with Bobby for five years, and in all that time as a living Boston police officer, never noticed Bobby having any kind of 'soul stank' that deados exude. When Roy mentions he's heard of rare artifacts capable of masking it, and would be something that Bobby would carry on his person at all times, Nick figures out what Bobby meant when he said he wore his grandmother's St. Christopher medallion around his wrist 'for protection.'Bobby meets a man in a sports jersey in a coffee shop, handing him half of some kind of metallic sphere. They talk about how they've finally built the network to take down RIPD and restore the Staff of Jericho, something no deado has ever been able to do in the past 3,000 years. Bobby tells his cohort to 'find himself some trouble.'Come morning, Julia calls Bobby to tell him about the elderly Chinese man finding her at the track. She can't help but think that Nick is trying to reach out to her from the other side. Bobby tells Julia she probably shouldn't be alone, and he'll take her to lunch later on and they can talk. As Bobby hangs up, he sees a VCR repair shop car pull up in front of his house and watches it knowingly. He punches in a code to unlock and open one of two small, secure containers, one of which is already open. In the other container is another metallic hemisphere like the one he gave to the contact the previous night. He takes it out and puts it in his pocket.Nick and Roy walk toward Bobby's house and agree that Roy will take point at the front while Nick goes around the back. Roy knocks on the door, shows an ID and says he wants to ask a question about a tandoori clay oven. Bobby, of course, knows this sexy blonde lady is an RIPD officer, but plays it cool, inviting 'her' in and then offering a drink.Bobby goes into his kitchen, but stops as Nick darts out of hiding, holding a soul eraser rifle Bobby had hidden there. Bobby sees ""Jerry Chen"" and knows it's Nick. Roy enters and starts to read one of the cards, but Nick reminds him they can skip that part, and tells Bobby to take off his St. Christopher's medal. Bobby agreeably does so, and the house immediately falls apart from the soul stank. Roy finds and extracts a large cross-shaped piece of gold from the water heater.Nick and Roy put the soul cuffs on Bobby, put the gold in the trunk and drive off to take Bobby in to RIPD headquarters. During the drive, Bobby reveals that a time he was shot during a bust and got a medal after miraculously pulling through, actually killed him. He intends to stay on Earth because he doesn't accept someone or something else deciding what happens to him. But his comment about having 'taken a little on the side to pay for lap dances' arouses Roy's suspicion.RIPD officers at the Boston HQ are bringing in a gothic female deado, sitting her on a bench where several other deados await 'booking' and incarcerating to await final Judgement. Among them is the one in the sports jersey. All of the deados are 'popped' and looking non-human.As Roy and Nick book Bobby and take the metallic hemisphere, Roy raises his voice to his usual loud bluster as he reveals what made him suspicious about the 'lap dance' comment: He and Proctor were briefly lovers, and this might have had a hand in Roy being on the RIPD.Bobby is still cocky as Nick pushes him to the bench with the popped deados, and they all look at each other, a few nodding and watching.Roy brings the metallic hemisphere and the cross-shaped piece of gold to evidence for tagging and storing. One of the evidence clerks mentions that another similar metallic hemisphere was just tagged a few moments ago, and she puts the one brought in by Roy, with the other one that is still in a bin, awaiting storage.As the clerk tosses the hemisphere into the bin with the other hemisphere, the two pieces of metal, finally in close proximity, float a little into the air and begin to spin, moving toward each other to assemble into a complete sphere.Right on cue, Bobby 'casually remarks' to his fellow deados that one of the perks of being a deado is that they can't hear certain frequencies so well. Nick looks toward the evidence vault and sees the metallic sphere assembling itself. But just as he shouts a warning, the sphere gives off a huge sonic pulse that paralyzes all the RIPD staff. Bobby taunts Nick, saying he and the other deados let themselves be captured because they were planning a raid on RIPD HQ. The artifact they smuggled in freezes up RIPD officers but doesn't affect the deados. They storm the evidence vault and grab all the golden components that are in storage. By the time the freeze and stun starts to wear off enough for Roy to shoot the sonic pulse bomb and neutralize it, Bobby and the deados have escaped through the makeshift bathroom and storm out of the VCR repair shop back in Boston, living people scattering in terror.A female unpopped accomplice passes Bobby a cell phone, who tells Pulaski that the raid was a success. Pulaski shouts to a number of deados gathered atop the Boston Commonwealth building, all of whom are carrying more components for the Staff of Jericho. Hurriedly, they all begin putting them together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, assembling the ancient artifact. As they build, energy starts to rise from the spot into the sky, opening a hole in the overhead clouds.Nick, Roy and a number of other RIPD officers race in pursuit. Some of the deados are waiting there, exchanging soul eraser gunfire to slow the RIPD down. As several drive off in a sanitation truck, another jumps down from it, blasting automatic fire from a minigun like soul eraser weapon that wipes out a number of the RIPD officers. Nick and Roy duck back into the shop for cover as the deado's minigun jams. He ducks behind a car where the gothic female deado crouches, and works to fix the jam. Meanwhile, Roy is reloading his twin soul eraser revolvers. This 'Dodge City' like environment is just like his old home turf in the 19th Century as a Marshall in the Old West. He stomps back out into the street, ready for a quickdraw showdown. Just as the minigun wielder and the female deado jump out to resume fire, Roy draws both sixguns and blasts them down, erasing them. He and Nick pick off two other deados hiding in ambush, having figured out their hiding spots from Roy's knowledge of Old West fighting.A wind starts to pick up, and Nick and Roy watch various debris swept off by it. Whirling wind funnels start to form as the artifact nears completion.Meanwhile, two Boston police show up to bring Julia to her planned meeting with Bobby. Their tones of voice and facial expressions show they're unpopped deados in league with Bobby.As Bobby and several deados arrive at the Commonwealth building, Pulaski and a number of other deados prepare a barricade and lots of soul erasing firepower to guard all approaches.Roy and Nick see the largest wind funnel massing over the Commonwealth building and know that's where Bobby is heading. Several cars with deado drivers and passengers pursue them and try to stop them. Using some modern Boston police driving, Nick leads them through a wild chase among several collapsing buildings and garages, that drop parked automobiles that destroy the other deado cars.At the Commonwealth, Bobby tells the deados with him to bring the last components up top while he waits for 'the final piece.' Just then, the car carrying Julia arrives. Bobby takes out some cumin powder and inhales it, 'popping' himself and revealing his deado nature in front of Julia. He grabs her and takes her up to the roof of the Commonwealth.A news helicopter flies near the Commonwealth, trying to make sense of what they're reporting, when a small jeep collides with them, and is knocked back atop the Commonwealth roof.As Roy and Nick approach the barricade, Pulaski fires at them, using his deado agility and acrobatics to his advantage. Nick speeds up, scooping Pulaski atop the hood of the car, then driving it up so the barricade's construction launches the car, with Pulaski and several other deados still clinging to it, up over the barricade. It hits the street on the opposite side and races on, most of the other deados being thrown off, but Pulaski tenaciously clinging to the hood. Nick and Roy both shout the mantra 'relax body' as the car speeds up again, plowing into the side of a building. Pulaski is pinned atop the car hood, between its roof and the building wall-- and Roy and Nick with their guns pointed at him through the broken windshield. They both fire and Pulaski is finally erased.On the Commonwealth roof, the many-armed deado holds Julia fast while Bobby finishes assembling the Staff of Jericho; the cross-shaped piece of gold an apparent centerpiece/console. Bobby then tells Julia that one final piece is needed: the blood of a living human sacrifice, which Bobby intends for Julia to serve as.Nick and Roy bust onto the roof, weapons drawn. Bobby grabs Julia and holds her as a shield, and then takes a long metal rebar with a sharp point, and drives it through Julia's body, impaling her. As the free for all shoothout begins, and Roy's Old West sharpshooting blends with Nick's more modern markshmanship to eradicate the deados, Julia's blood is sucked from her wound into the artifact, a small globe of her blood congealing in an opening within it; powering it up to full. The afterlife tunnel is reversed; dead spirits beginning to free fall back down to Earth.It's time for the final showdown, and Nick and Roy are fighting mad. Reloading their weapons, they storm the roof, erasing all the defending deados. Roy reaches the staff and tries to pry out the cross-shaped centerpiece.As Nick reaches Bobby, the last deado standing, his weapon is empty. Bobby attacks him hand to hand, and is clobbering him as Roy struggles to pull the console centerpiece from the Staff of Jericho. Needing to improvise, he grabs a loose power cable and makes a lasso. Spotting the jeep lying atop the Commonwealth sign, he lassos the jeep and, pulling with all his might, finally dislodges it, bring it down atop the artifact, smashing it.Bobby turns around in disbelief as he sees the jeep crush the Staff of Jericho, breaking apart the components and halting the reverse flow of deceased spirits. When he turns to face Nick again, Nick has slipped one last bullet into his soul eraser and chambers the round; the barrel pointed at Bobby's face. Taking great satisfaction at the vengeance moment's poetic justice, Nick fires, erasing Bobby.Nick hurries to the stricken Julia, who lies dying on the Commonwealth roof. Julia looks around, time seeming paused as she sees Nick at her side, seeing him as he used to be while living. Nick knows this is because Julia has just died and is not rising up toward the afterlife tunnel only because seeing Nick anchors her near. Julia kisses Nick, happy to see her husband with her again, but this moment finally helps Nick to do what he has to do: accept his own death and let go, telling Julia she must live her life without him. Telling Julia he'll always love her, he finally says goodbye.Julia awakens abruptly in a hospital room, a doctor watching over her... or someone Julia merely sees as a doctor, but is actually Proctor. Seeing Julia awaken, the 'doctor' nods to her and heads out, where Nick and Roy are waiting. Proctor tells Nick that Julia will recover.As they leave the hospital building, Proctor tells Nick and Roy that Eternal Affairs conducted the disciplinary hearing without them, despite their having missed it only because they were saving the world. As a new recruit, Nick has been let off with a warning, but Roy has had his term of service extended by fifty-three more years. Annoyed, Roy calls Proctor by her first name, Mildred.Proctor reaches into a bag she's been holding and gives Roy back his hat, which she's managed to recover for him. This appeases Roy's anger promptly. Showing her lingering attraction to Roy, Proctor leans in and gently bites on his goatee before walking off.Roy remembers something he's gotten for Nick. He pulled some strings and gotten him some new ID's, so he will appear to the living as someone other than the elderly Jerry Chen. Nick is happy at this, until he sees the new ID's. Roy just shrugs and says that's all he was able to acquire. They enter their car and we see them in their 'avatar' forms-- Nick now appears to the living as an early adolescent girl scout (Piper Mackenzie Harris)."
Blue Jasmine,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334873/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A New York socialite, deeply troubled and in denial, arrives in San Francisco to impose upon her sister. She looks like a million dollars but isn't bringing money, peace or love. Jasmine French used to be on the top of the heap as a New York socialite, but now is returning to her estranged sister in San Francisco utterly ruined. As Jasmine struggles with her haunting memories of a privileged past bearing dark realities she ignored, she tries to recover in her present. Unfortunately, it all proves a losing battle as Jasmine's narcissistic hangups and their consequences begin to overwhelm her. In doing so, her old pretensions and new deceits begin to foul up everyone's lives, especially her own.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Jasmine from New York who lives in a fashionable society, moves to San Francisco to live with her sister after she goes completely broke and hovers near a nervous breakdown. Jasmine is struggling with her past memories but she wants to put aside all those haunted memories and wants to start a new life just from the scratch, but in doing so she chooses the path of deceit and fouls up everyone's lives.—someonesmart21 After her marriage to a wealthy businessman collapses, New York socialite Jasmine flees to San Francisco and the modest apartment of her sister Ginger. Although she's in a fragile emotional state and lacks job skills, Jasmine still manages to voice her disapproval of Ginger's boyfriend, Chili. Jasmine begrudgingly takes a job in a dentist's office, while Ginger begins dating a man who's a step up from Chili.—Jwelch5742 After years of blasé estrangement and absolute self-indulgence in life's inexhaustible pleasures, elegant Manhattan socialite Jeanette Francis swallows her pride to reunite with Ginger, her working-class sister. But now, the money's gone, and the drugs don't work. After all, it seems like only yesterday that Jeanette was the untouchable queen of the castle. Now, defeated and broken, the fallen epitome of effortless American glamour is lucky to have a roof over her head and someone who, God knows why, genuinely loves her. And then, as Jeanette struggles to find her feet and cope with the unbearable certainty of an achingly humble forced reality, fortune smiles upon her again. Will the godsent gift mark a longed-for fresh start? Is the perpetually aloof Blue Jasmine spared from the daily ordeal of a mundane, dangerously familiar existence?—Nick Riganas As the film opens we are in an airplane watching a woman named Jasmine (Cate Blanchett), dressed in a white Chanel suit, jewelry and personality all screaming wealth, as she talks nonstop to people that do not know her, nor appear interested in her story. After all, she is not engaging them in an actual conversation, just expects them to pay rapt attention as she complains. We follow Jasmine from the plane to baggage-claim, then to a cab, which lets her off in front of a rather seedy apartment in San Francisco overhead a store. By the time Jasmine exits the taxi, wheeling $10,000 worth of Louis Vuitton luggage, Woody Allen has already provided us with a basic understanding of the backstory for Jasmine French as a former New York socialite, whose fall from that world was so complete that she sees no option but to move in with her blue-collar sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins).It is soon made clear to the viewers that Jasmine not only feels the apartment is not remotely up to her standards, but has no more fondness for her sister than for her residence. We see that Ginger has always felt envious of her sister, she was the pretty one, the golden-girl, one with a sense of style that helped her land a millionaire husband and the accompanying lifestyle. The story is told in part through flashbacks that reveal her former life and the secrets behind its rise and fall. When you are on top of the world, clearly it's a long way down.In one of the flashbacks, we are shown a time when Ginger and her former husband, Augie, (Andrew Dice Clay), had made a rare visit to New York to see her sister. Jasmine made little secret of her lack of interest in spending time with them; her rich husband Hal (Alec Baldwin) sent them off in a limousine to tour the city, then paid for a hotel rather than having the guests stay in their home. The following day at Hal's country estate in the Hamptons, Augie proudly tells how he has won $200,000 in the lottery and plans to use that money to start his own construction company. Jasmine suggests that Augie invest the total amount in a new... and obviously to the audience, shady... business venture of Hal's. Riding back in the chauffeured limo, Ginger chances to see Hal leave a restaurant with another woman and kiss her, confirming that he's cheating on Jasmine.We gradually see how Jasmine's life of privilege and wealth unraveled. Her husband's thefts, financial maneuvering and schemes grew more and more dangerous, business partners removed themselves from his projects stating they feared prison, but Jasmine maintained her willful ignorance and denial to what was happening. Hal's infidelities, however, proved too much for her, and in revenge she reported his corporate fraud to the law. He was arrested, and his racket was publicly exposed causing scandal and outrage. Jasmine's property, homes, and lavish belongings were seized. Jasmine and Hal's son, feeling shamed and disgraced by his father's crimes, quit Harvard and disappeared without a trace. Augie's $200K was lost and with it all hopes of owning his own business; he and Ginger parted ways.In present day San Francisco, Jasmine begins a relationship with Dwight (Peter Saarsgard) - successful, wealthy and with political ambitions - whom she sees as a chance of regaining her former glory. She invents a back history involving her husband's career as a surgeon, his death from a heart attack (in reality, he committed suicide in jail) and her career as an interior decorator. Soon,  Dwight recommends they get married,  which thrills Jasmine. Meanwhile, Ginger dumps her likable blue-collared boyfriend, Chili (Bobby Canavale), due largely to Jasmine's criticisms, and begins dating the equally likable Al (Louis C.K.),  who turns out to be married, which destroys their relationship. In the end, she returns to Chili.Jasmine's  chance of marriage is destroyed when the vindictive Augie reveals her lies to Dwight. At this point, it is evident that all paths of redemption for Jasmine are gone. Dwight takes the truth very badly and ends his engagement to Jasmine, who yet again has an emotional meltdown. In the final scene, we watch as Jasmine walks out of Ginger's apartment, her Channel suit disheveled, and sits alone on a park bench, talking to herself again... lost in her own neurotic world without hope.--Lane J.

Side Effects,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2053463/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young woman's world unravels when a drug prescribed by her psychiatrist has unexpected side effects. Despite being reunited with her husband from prison, Emily Taylor becomes severely depressed with emotional episodes and suicide attempts. After conferring with her previous doctor, her psychiatrist, Jonathan Banks, eventually prescribes an experimental new medication called Ablixa, but the drug's side-effects lead to Emily killing her husband while in a ""sleepwalking"" state. With Emily plea-bargained into mental-hospital confinement and Dr. Banks' practice crumbling around him, the case seems closed. However, Dr. Banks cannot accept full responsibility and investigates to clear his name. What follows is a dark quest that threatens to tear apart what's left of his life even as he discovers the diabolical truth of this tragedy.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In New York, insider trader Martin Taylor is released after four years in prison and his mother and his wife Emily welcome him. Unexpectedly Emily is depressed and tries to commit suicide, hitting her car against the garage wall. Emily goes to the hospital and psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Banks treats her and she decides to be his client. Dr. Banks consults her former psychiatrist Dr. Victoria Siebert and she suggests that Dr. Banks uses the new drug Ablixa in Emily's treatment. Emily tries to commit suicide again, but she returns to a normal life with Martin and occasionally has sleepwalking episodes. One day, Emily stabs her husband to death while sleepwalking and is sent to trial. She is declared not guilty but is forced to go to a psychiatric facility and Dr. Banks is responsible to periodically evaluate her mental condition. Dr. Banks has his career destroyed with the negative publicity and also his marriage with the unemployed financial consultant Dierdre Banks after receiving anonymous photos of Emily with him. He decides to investigate the case to clear his name and discovers that Emily faked her suicide attempts. His further investigation discloses an evil scheme in the stock market.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil After her husband Martin completes a four-year prison sentence for insider trading, Emily Taylor drives into a wall in an apparent suicide attempt. Jonathan Banks, her assigned psychiatrist, prescribes a series of antidepressants, but none work. Jonathan contacts Emily's previous psychiatrist, Victoria Siebert, who suggests an experimental new drug, Ablixa. The drug seems to help Emily, but gives her sleepwalking episodes as a side effect. One night, Emily stabs Martin to death while sleepwalking. Jonathan fights for Emily's acquittal in court. She pleads insanity and is declared not guilty on the condition that she stays in a psychiatric hospital until cleared by Jonathan. The publicity destroys Jonathan's reputation, and his colleagues assume negligence on his part. The opening shot shows blood stains. We don't know what has happened, or where, or to whom.Emily Taylor (Rooney Mara)'s husband Martin (Channing Tatum) is serving a four-year prison sentence for insider trading. She visits him in prison, passing through the desk guard (Carmen Peláez). As he is about to be released, Emily thanks her boss (Polly Draper) for her support. She receives her husband with joy, together with Martin's mother (Ann Dowd). That night, at their middle-class house, they make love, although she doesn't seem really focused or attached to it. Martin mentions a certain Marshall Hellman he knew while doing time who used to work as some sort of banker and may give him some marvelous job in Dubai. Marshall was in for some tax fraud, but will be out soon. Martin promises to make Emily affluent as well. Emily answers ""OK, babe,"" but once again, she doesn't look happy, or interested, or having any kind of emotional response.Emily goes to the parking lot for her car. Her face looks blank, as usual. Her handbag falls down for no apparent reason, and a garage attendant (Haraldo Álvarez) helps her out. Shortly afterwards, she buckles up and drives her car into a concrete wall in an apparent suicide attempt. She seems to have let herself go.Meanwhile at a local hospital, Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) is trying to calm down a police officer (James Martínez) who's manhandling a patient in a rough way. The patient, Augustin (Vladimi Versailles), only speaks French, and calms down when Banks speaks to him in the same language. The problem happened to be that Augustin had seen his late father driving a cab. Jonathan tells the cop that for Haitians it's a normal assumed thing to see dead relatives after they are dead, in their process of feeling grief and getting over it. The Desk Nurse (Jacqueline Antaramian), tells Banks to tend to Emily Taylor, with a minor head trauma. Banks is her assigned psychiatrist. Emily looks unfocused when she's questioned by Banks. The insurance company is going to be on her, as there was not even an attempt to halt to a stop and the brakes look alright. Banks gives some instructions to Martin and his mother. Banks puts her on an anti-depressant medication. He fears for her safety but agrees to her release from the hospital as long as she attends sessions with him on a regular basis, on Martin's charge.Emily goes back to work. Her co-worker Joan (Michelle Vergara Moore) sees her running to the lavatory and asks her whether she's OK. Emily drinks some water from the tab and looks at her horrible appearance. Her boss notices her throwing up and says that the pills she's taking used to throw her up as well, and mentions another medication, Celexa, which worked better for her.Emily tries a series of anti-depressants but none of them work for her. Emily tells Jonathan that she wanted to be into graphic design and that's what she moved to New York. While working in a pub to pay for her school fees, she met Martin and fell in love.Jonathan contacts Emily's previous psychiatrist in Connecticut, Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who suggests that Jonathan put Emily on a new drug called Ablixa. Victoria says that Emily felt invisible towards her father and that she felt abandoned again when Martin went to jail, so it's better that she's seeing a male psychologist this time. Victoria says that new drugs have a kind of placebo effect in some patients, so she's trying the new med in another one of her patients. Victoria also mentions a miscarriage which Emily hadn't mentioned to Jonathan, who is reluctant to put Emily on the experimental drug.Jonathan and Victoria speak before a conference Victoria is about to hear. Meanwhile, Emily and Martin go to a music concert. Carl (David Costabile) has given them the tickets, and Martin thinks that this is because he was the one who went to the federals, and Carl now feels rotten about it. She tells Emily not to mention the Hellman possibility to Carl and his partner Kayla (Mamie Gummer). They dress up to the nines. Emily goes to pick the drinks from the bartender (Steven Platt). Emily looks at herself in a distorted mirror and feels that she can't go on. Kayla mentions she is also on medication. Kayla goes to fetch Martin, but Emily has to leave the room. Martin hugs her on the terraced balcony and takes her away.We can see the happy face of a model (Onika Day) advertising Ablixa. Emily is on the platform of an underground railway station. She looks towards a cop and prepares to jump from the platform, but the cop, Beahan (Victor Cruz), prevents her from jumping. Later, Jonathan is recommending his wife, Dierdre (Vinessa Shaw) an anxiety drug so she'll feel less nervous when she attends the job interview; she is in direct competition with two other highly-qualified candidates. Emily appears and interrupts Jonathan and Deirdre's conversation.As she has attempted suicide a second time by trying to jump onto the underground track, Jonathan puts her on the Ablixa. The medication works, enabling Emily to function normally except for occasional sleepwalking episodes, a side effect of the drug. Later, Banks and his two business partners, (Laila Robins and Peter Friedman) are having lunch with a drug representative (Andrea Bogart), who's praising a new medicine (Delatrex) and needs Banks start trialing it with his patients. That night, Jonathan and Deirdre's son, Ezra (Mitchell Michaliszyn), interrupts their intimate moment.Emily is happy again, walking down the street with Martin, laughing, having passionate sex with him. Martin notices the change in Emily and comments that, whoever invented that pill, is going to become rich. However, one night, Emily gets up in the middle of the night, prepares lunch and sets the music volume high, but she is sleepwalking. Martin wants to stop the medication, but Emily doesn't want to change it. Martin goes to visit Hellman in prison and plans to open an office in Houston. Another patient of Banks (Elizabeth Rich) agrees to start the medication because she doesn't need to pay a cent for it. Emily arrives late to work and cannot explain why she's late. Her boss tells her to go home for the day, but that it can't happen again. Back home, Emily takes a pill and is able to smile.Jonathan consoles Dierdre was unsuccessful in her job interview. Martin comes home after talking to Hellman, and it looks like the business will succeed. Emily is preparing a glorious romantic dinner, but without even opening her mouth, she stabs Martin to death while seemingly sleepwalking. The next day, NYPD Detective (Scott Shepherd) questions her, and she says that she went to sleep and then woke up to see him dead. Jonathan has to go to the police station, as Emily won't stop saying his name. Emily was setting the table for three, but Jonathan wasn't expected there. Jonathan brings out the sleepwalking side effect, but the detective and the Assistant District Attorney (Michael Nathanson) look at each other in disbelief. The ADA tells him that somebody will be punished, Emily or Jonathan: either Emily is a murderer, or Jonathan mistreated her.Emily is brought to trial by Klein (Timothy Klein), and Jonathan fights for her acquittal. He is criticized publicly for fumbling Emily's case. Emily is pushed to take some sleep pills by the prison's doctor, but she says that she doesn't want to see another pill in her life again. Victoria tells Jonathan that he couldn't have done anything else. Emily's lawyer (Sheila Tapia) produces cases in which the accused was acquitted because of the sleepwalking idea. Banks is in dire straits, and he admits to that. Martin's mother is paying the lawyer. Banks can't sleep now because of Emily's case. Emily writes a letter and Martin's mother reads it in a TV program. The TV anchor (Josh Elliott) tries to understand why she is helping her daughter-in-law. Nobody from the Ablixa factory wants to comment, but Dr. Peter Joubert (Sasha Bardey) says there are reasons for the compulsory inclusion of a black box in the anti-depressant box. Reporters (Ashley Morrison and Steve Lacy) pester the three Banks household members. Banks' patients (Ken Marks & Devin Ratray) start acting weird because of the case. Banks' colleagues assume he has been negligent due to his heavy work-load. Jeffrey Childs (Russell G. Jones) interrogates Jonathan Banks. Jonathan claims that because his wife lost his job, and all the bills he had to pay pushed him to do multiple shifts. Emily eventually agrees to plead insanity; she is declared not guilty on the condition that she stay in a mental institution until cleared by a psychiatrist.Due to the case's bad publicity, Jonathan's career is left in ruins, although he tries to reassure Dierdre. One of the partners brings up the case of Alison Finn, while Jonathan was doing his residency, a girl who stalked him and named him in her suicide note. He says that the oral sex idea with Alison was a fantasy, not real. However, he sets out to clear his name and uncovers evidence that not only did Emily fake her suicide attempts, but was involved in a criminal conspiracy with Victoria, all that with an internet search. Sleepwalking was a side effect of the medicine but Victoria didn't warn Jonathan, and he didn't check.After his conversation with Victoria, Jonathan speaks with the parking attendant at the beginning, who noticed that Emily was wearing her seat-belt. Emily's boss understood Emily's feeling because she felt the same during a hard time in her life, and mentions William Syron's Darkness Visible book. The boss mentions a ""poisonous fog"" taken from the book, which reminds Jonathan of something which Emily said. Jonathan looks for a Julia which used to work alongside Emily, but there is only a Susan (Susan Gross). Dierdre has to go out and pick up Ezra from school because Jonathan forgot. Dierdre is fed-up.Jonathan interviews Emily at the mental hospital. She looks better. Emily tells Jonathan that Julia was somebody she used to work with at the bar, but from whom she hadn't heard from the day of the killing. Jonathan tells Dierdre his suspicions of a conspiracy to make rival companies go up in the stock market. Dierdre tells him to quit the case. After being administered what Jonathan claims is a truth serum. Emily behaves as if she's groggy from the drug, mentioning Madeleine, the miscarriage she had, which unbeknownst to her is actually a placebo: saltwater. This confirms Jonathan's suspicions, but the District Attorney cannot do anything about it.When Jonathan confronts Victoria with his findings and the fact that Victoria visited Emily at the mental hospital. She emails photographs to Jonathan's wife implying he had an affair with Emily; Jonathan's wife and stepson leave him. Jonathan manages to turn Emily and Victoria against each other by using legal means to prevent contact between them and making each believe that her partner had sold her out to Jonathan for a better deal.One day, Emily wants to phone her lawyer, but another patient is on the phone (Nicole Ansari-Cox), mumbling and taking forever to finish. Emily insists to the Wards Island desk nurse (LaChanze), who tells her that Dr. Banks has forbidden her to use the phone anyway. An orderly (Craig Grant) takes Emily away by sheer force. Another nurse (Alice Niedermair-Ludwig) injects something in her arm to calm her down.Emily reveals the workings of the plot to Jonathan: she enjoyed the rich life and hated Martin for causing her to lose it. She specifically went to Victoria for counseling as she, too, had been abandoned by her husband, and the two began a romantic and sexual relationship. They taught each other about the workings of the financial world and faking psychiatric disorders. They then went to elaborate means to fake the side effects of Ablixa in order to manipulate the stock prices of the drug's manufacturer and its competitor, allowing the duo to become rich in the process.Jonathan asks the judge to release Emily, while Victoria is present. Victoria has returned back to her office and her previous work. Emily appears at Victoria's practice and they kiss each other passionately. Emily is wired and the police take Victoria away.In the next scene, Emily makes her obligatory visit to Dr. Banks, who proceeds to prescribe her more drugs against her wishes. As she storms out of his office, she sees her lawyer with Martin's mother, who slaps her because she's learned that her son's murder was intentional. Emily leaves the building and the police officers (Dennis Rees & Aaron Roman Weiner) chase her down and take her into custody and send her back to the mental ward.In the final scene, Jonathan has regained his normal life with his wife and son, and they get together after Ezra's school. Meanwhile, Emily sits in the ward, staring blankly out the window. A psychiatric nurse asks Emily how she's feeling, and she responds by saying apathetically: ""Better. Much better.""Outside her hospital room, life goes on, with all the noise of the traffic jam and the never-stopping life."

Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan get together to make a sex tape with over 20 cameras beside Charlie's bed. The time-lapsed tape fast forwards through the two doing all sorts of bedroom antics, including gymnastics, riding a horse, and having clowns jump in under the sheets. Charlie is pulled into the air by a paranormal force and thrown against walls, shelves, and doors until he lands on the bed again. Lindsay is frightened so she decides to go home when she flies into the air as well; she becomes possessed and throws him into the camera and kills him. The text explains that Charlie's body was found that day but he didn't stop partying until days later, and that his three kids were found missing, Lohan was arrested, again, and a reward was put out for the missing children.Several months later, Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller are walking in the Humboldt County woods in search of cannabis plants to steal. After stealing one and fleeing, they take shelter in a cabin in the woods. Upon entering they see three strange creatures, later confirmed to be Charlie's children, and turn them in for the reward. The feral children are placed in isolation at a child development research center for a few months until they are deemed well enough to be returned to familial custody. When Charlie's brother, Dan Sanders and his wife Jody come to collect them, they are told they can have them if they agree to stay in a large suburban middle-class home fitted with security cameras. Jody is reluctant to take the kids at first but soon adjusts to having them. In an attempt to bond with their new children, Jody auditions for a ballet performance, Swan Lake, and is cast in the lead role as the Swan Queen.Meanwhile, a continuing pattern of bizarre paranormal activity in their new home makes them investigate further.

After Kolb informs that Charlie will be sleeping with Lindsay Lohan, a car crashes into the room, killing Charlie.

Grudge Match,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1661382/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A pair of aging boxing rivals are coaxed out of retirement to fight one final bout, thirty years after their last match. Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen are two boxers who thirty years ago were rivals. Just before a big match Razor decides to retire because Billy slept with his girlfriend, Sally Rose and got her pregnant. Today a promoter, Dante Slate wants to have them fight each other but Razor doesn't want to. But when he loses his job and learns he's broke, he has no choice. So he trains under his old trainer. Billy while training, meets B.J., the son he had with Sally Rose and he asks B.J. to train him. And Sally Rose tries to get Razor to forgive her but he can't.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Back in the day, Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro) and Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Stallone) were the two biggest bruisers in the Pittsburgh boxing scene. Their fierce rivalry drawing nationwide attention, Razor and The Kid were deadlocked for the title of overall champion when the former announced his retirement just before the decisive 1983 match that would have determined the supreme champion. Three decades later, enterprising boxing promoter Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) lures the aging pugilists back into the ring for the fight that everyone has been waiting for. Meanwhile, when Razor and The Kid see each other for the first time in 30 years, the cameras are rolling as tempers suddenly flare. In no time that unscheduled scuffle goes viral, prompting both fighters to resume their intensive training in a bid to be the one who delivers the knockout blow during the highly anticipated bout.. In the 1980s, a rivalry developed between two boxing champions, Henry Razor Sharpe (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy the Kid McDonnen (Robert De Niro). Both fought each other in only two matches, Kid winning the first match and Razor winning the second match. Before the third and tie-breaking match could occur, Razor finds out that Kid slept with his girlfriend Sally Rose (Kim Basinger) and got her pregnant; in retaliation, he announces his retirement, to Kid's fury.Thirty years later, Razor is working in a shipyard and Kid has opened a restaurant; Kid retains a celebrity status and dreams of facing Razor one more time, but Razor has moved on and leads a simple, secluded life. One day, boxing promoter Dante Slate, Jr. (Kevin Hart) comes to Razor with a proposition: for fifteen thousand dollars, he will do motion-capture for a boxing video game. Razor's best friend and former trainer Louis Lightning Conlon (Alan Arkin) is in a nursing home, so Razor reluctantly takes the job to cover the nursing home bills. At the studio, Razor runs into Kid, who was also going to do motion-capture for the game; Kid provokes Razor into a fight, and the two destroy the motion-capture studio brawling with each other.Razor and Kid end up in jail, and neither of them gets paid for their video game work. However, the footage of their fight becomes an Internet sensation, and this gives Dante an idea: Grudgement Day, a final tie-breaker between Razor and Kid. Razor flatly refuses to fight Kid again, but when he discovers that he has been laid off by his shipyard (nothing personal, he was one of many) he has no choice but to accept Dante's offer.Dante launches a press conference, but as few people show interest or turn up he decides to promote the match through using lots of product placements, endorsements and public appearances by Razor and Kid at special events (particularly a mixed martial arts tournament and a skydiving event). This strategy works, mostly because most people enjoy watching the two boxers squabble and almost always fight with each other at those events. Besides this, the two boxers have to undergo training regimes that their aged bodies can barely handle.In the middle of all this, Sally Rose comes back into the lives of Razor and Kid. BJ, a football coach and Kid's son with Sally, meets Kid despite her warning him that Kid only cares about himself. At first the two don't get along, with Kid being dismissive of his son and BJ not taking it kindly; however the two slowly improve on their relationship, with BJ providing some training tips. Kid finds his trainer doesn't think he has a chance at winning, and fires him and takes BJ on as his own personal trainer; and BJ himself gets closer to Kid, even introducing him to his own son Trey (Camden Gray), with whom Kid immediately hits it off.Meanwhile, Sally meets Razor and wishes to get back with him. Razor is unsure about reconnecting with Sally after what she did with Kid, but Lightning (reinstated as Razor's personal trainer) tells him he should accept part of the blame for Sally straying as in his youth he had been too much of a workaholic to really spend time with her. Razor meets Sally and apologizes for walking away from her, and the two reconcile. Sally herself confesses that she had only slept with Kid to get back at Razor because she had seen him with another woman; she later learnt that nothing had happened, but by then it was too late.Meanwhile, BJ entrusts Trey to Kid for dinner and a movie, but instead Kid heads to his bar and leaves Trey there while he goes to have sex with a woman in his car. Hours later, a bored Trey gets into the same car, and when he sees Kid and the woman he freaks out and starts the car moving; fortunately Kid manages to stop the car and prevent an accident, but ends up getting arrested. BJ bails Kid out, but is furious with him for having neglected his son and put his life at risk and refuses to train Kid any further.When Razor and Sally drive home, they get into a car accident. They suffer no major injuries, but a worried Lightning confirms what he had suspected: Razor is blind in one eye. Lightning and Sally keep it a secret, but convince him to withdraw from the match for his own health and safety. Upon hearing that Razor has backed out, Kid angrily tracks down Razors house and rails at him for chickening out on him again, eventually simply begging him to go through with the match as this one shot at glory is the only worthwhile thing he has in life.After long deliberation, Razor decides to fight. He meets with BJ (no issues there) and Sally, and explains that Kid made him walk away from her and boxing, his two greatest loves in life; he got her back, but he wants to box one last time. Kid meets BJ and apologizes for what happened with Trey; he presents him with a scrapbook containing pictures and articles of BJ, showing that he really did take an interest in him. BJ accepts the apology, and returns to training Kid.The time for the fight arrives, and Razor and Kid brutalize each other as the rounds go on, neither giving the other any quarter. Kid is able to secure an advantage by punching Razors blind eye, but Razor refuses to concede. Around the time of the final round, Razors face is a mess. A fearful Sally tells the truth to BJ, who passes it on to Kid and urges him to concede the match: the fight and victory Kid dreamed of mean nothing as hes fixed to win, and the best way for him to go out is as a sportsman, respectfully and gracefully. Kid refuses to relent and pummels Razor, but after knocking down Razor he has a change of heart and helps up Razor. Razor turns the fight to his favour and knocks down Kid, but also helps him up.The film ends with the two still standing at the end of the match, both having reconciled their differences (but both still dislike each other). Razor wins the tie-breaker on points, and becomes a hero who got back the girl and prize of his dreams, while Kid has let go of his own dreams in favour of a family to rely on."
Kick-Ass 2,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1650554/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Following Kick-Ass' heroics, other citizens are inspired to become masked crusaders, but Red Mist leads his own group of evil super-villains to get revenge, kill Kick-Ass, and destroy everything he stands for. After Kick-Ass' insane bravery inspires a new wave of self-made masked crusaders, led by the badass Colonel Stars and Stripes, our hero joins them on patrol. When these amateur superheroes are hunted down by Red Mist -- reborn as The Mother F%&*^r -- only the blade-wielding Hit Girl can prevent their annihilation. When we last saw junior assassin Hit Girl and young vigilante Kick-Ass, they were trying to live as normal teenagers Mindy and Dave. With graduation looming and uncertain what to do, Dave decides to start the world's first superhero team with Mindy. Unfortunately, when Mindy is busted for sneaking out as Hit Girl, she's forced to retire, leaving her to navigate the terrifying world of high-school mean girls on her own. With no one left to turn to, Dave joins forces with Justice Forever, run by a born-again ex-mobster named Colonel Stars and Stripes. Just as they start to make a real difference on the streets, the world's first super villain, The Mother F%&*^r, assembles his own evil league and puts a plan in motion to make Kick-Ass and Hit Girl pay for what they did to his dad. There's only one problem with his scheme: If you mess with one member of Justice Forever, you mess with them all.—Universal Pictures Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) stands several feet away from Mindy Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz) as she aims a gun at him. She fires a round at his chest, throwing him off his feet, but it's shown he was trying out a bulletproof vest. Dave says that was awesome but is nervous when he sees Mindy pull out a bigger gun. He tells her not to shoot it at his chest and he walks away, leaving her to shoot him in the back.In the four years since Dave became the costumed vigilante known as Kick-Ass, Mindy has been enrolled at school by her new guardian and her father's former partner Marcus (Morris Chestnut) but has been cutting to continue training herself to become tougher. She hasn't gotten caught because she hacked the school's server and gave herself perfect attendance. Dave deals with being a high school senior and an increase in fatigue and boredom, even around his friends Marty (Clark Duke) and Todd (Augustus Prew). Additionally, other individuals have gone around dressed as superheroes, inspired by Dave's heroism. Dave asks Mindy to help him continue training to become as good a fighter as she is, which means she subjects him to a lot of beatings and bullets to the chest.Meanwhile, the spoiled and rotten Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has moved to Long Island and still seeks revenge against Kick-Ass for the death of his father (in the previous film). He complains to his mother Angie (Yancy Butler) and his new bodyguard/driver Javier (John Leguizamo) about her removing a news report on Kick-Ass from the DVR. Angie blocks out her son by drinking and getting into a tanning bed. Chris throws a tantrum and starts kicking the tanning bed, causing it to break and electrocute his mother.Dave expresses a fear of dying to Mindy, especially after her father was killed trying to be a superhero. Mindy tells Dave that if he fears death, he will eventually die, and adds that she considers her dad to have been the first true superhero.As Chris puts away his mom's belongings after her funeral, Javier comes across a pair of guns that she owned. Chris also happens upon some S&M gear of hers (including anal beads), but he is most interested in the outfit that she has.Mindy puts Dave's training to the test by having him walk around a dangerous part of the city dressed as a pimp. A four thugs follow and harass him with homophobic slurs, but Dave starts to take them on, doing pretty well until they gang up on him. One thug pulls a knife and prepares to kill him, but Mindy comes in dressed as Hit Girl and single-handedly takes all of them out, ending with her slicing the hand off the lead thug with the knife. Dave and Mindy hear police sirens, forcing Mindy to run. Marcus overhears on the radio that someone fitting the description of Hit Girl is on the run, and he calls Mindy, who fakes sick and rushes home on her motorcycle before Marcus gets home. She makes it and nearly fools him until he spots blood on her cheek, then sees she's still wearing her costume. Marcus tells her it is time for her to be done with Hit Girl for good.Dave finds Mindy at school the next day and tries to talk to her, but she says she's sorry for ditching him and nearly getting him killed, and that she is done with Hit Girl. Unfortunately, everybody overhearing this conversation thinks Mindy is breaking up with Dave. This includes Dave's girlfriend Katie, who effectively breaks up with him when she mistakenly thinks he is seeing Mindy and refuses to listen to his denials.Dave still takes it upon himself to be Kick-Ass, receiving a welcome back from the citizens of New York, but he feels alone without Hit Girl as his partner. He contacts another costumed citizen named Dr. Gravity, a self-proclaims to be a physics professor (he's not) who has a weapon that levitates objects (it's a baseball bat wrapped in tin foil). As he walks the streets, Kick-Ass is attacked by two thugs. He fights back and is helped by Dr. Gravity. They send the thugs away, and Dr. Gravity invites Kick-Ass to join his team of heroes.At the same time, Chris has donned his mother's S&M gear and fashioned himself a super-villain costume, calling himself The Motherfucker. His first act as a villain is to try and spread the word of his crimes by robbing a convenience store, but he's pissed to find there are no cameras around. He instead starts shooting the beverages, even hitting himself in the eye with his gun because of the recoil.Marcus, deciding that Mindy needs to live a normal life as a teenage girl, takes her to her first slumber party at the home of the high school's queen bee, Brooke, joined by Brooke's two shallow friends Harlow and Dolce. They pester Mindy with questions such as if she's ever done anything with a boy. They put on a music video from a boy band called Union J, which gets Mindy's hormones going. She joins the girls to go sniff bath salts.Meanwhile that same evening, Kick-Ass joins Dr. Gravity at a meeting place for a new team of superheroes known as Justice Forever, led by former mafia hitman-turned-Born-Again-Christian superhero, Colonel Stars and Stripes. Also joining them is Night-Bitch, a young woman who started fighting crime after her sister was murdered; a husband-and-wife duo named Remembering Tommy after their son who disappeared; Insect Man, a gay superhero who doesn't wear a mask because he feels he has nothing to hide; and Battle Guy, who is really Marty faking an origin story to sound cool, though Dave recognizes him and reveals to Marty that he is Kick-Ass. Together, Justice Forever patrols the streets of the city performing good deeds, such as volunteering at a soup kitchen. Dave enjoys the experience and even starts hooking up with Night-Bitch. Todd tries to join with a wetsuit of his own, taking on the name Ass-Kicker, which Dave and Marty mock him for, causing him to angrily leave.Chris decides to train himself to fight against Kick-Ass, going as far as getting help from Chuck Liddell. He gets his ass kicked by a skilled fighter, but Chris decides to hire this guy to join his planned super-villain team, naming this guy Black Death (which Javier thinks is racist).At school, Brooke tries out for the cheerleading squad by putting on a risque performance for everyone watching. When Mindy is up, she visualizes a fight as Hit Girl between a couple of ninjas. She shows off her fighting skills and passes it off as dance moves, which impresses everybody and makes Brooke look inferior.One evening, Dave and Marty go off in their superhero costumes to join Colonel Stars & Stripes and Night Bitch to catch a man named Jimmy Kim, who runs a prostitution ring with girls, and even children, from his village. Colonel S&S busts the bouncer up and storms in with the other three heroes, taking out Kim's gangsters together. When asked where the girls are, Kim refuses to comply, so Colonel S&S brings in his dog Eisenhower to take a bite of Kim's groin, and then threatens to shoot Kim in the head until he relents and admits where the girls are. Justice Forever frees the girls and gives them over $50,000 from Kim to send them on their way.Meanwhile, Chris continues recruiting villains for his team. With Javier's help, he picks three people: a short-statured and ruthless killer who Chris names The Tumor, a former Triad member who is dubbed Genghis Carnage, and a hulking blonde Russian ex-KGB woman named Mother Russia who apparently ate her cellmate.Mindy goes on her first date with a boy named Simon. He drives her out to the woods where he tries to hook up with her, but she refuses. Mindy then hears something in the woods and walks near it, only to find Brooke and her friends, along with other high schoolers, parked in their cars. Brooke walks out and tells Mindy that she's a loser who messed with the queen bee and is now getting stung. She gets Simon (whom is her boyfriend) to ditch Mindy and leave her alone in the woods. Mindy goes to Dave's house in tears, expressing her humiliation. He reassures her that she is tough and beautiful, inspiring her to be herself to take them on.Mindy goes to school the next day looking absolutely stunning in a purple dress and wearing make-up. She catches Brooke trying to use some ""Mean Girls"" ploy on a dowdy-looking girl, but Mindy tells the girl she doesn't need to follow them and gives her a wad of cash to get herself something nice. Brooke tries to browbeat Mindy again by telling her that she will never live the life that Brooke does, but Mindy simply responds by pulling out a device that looks like a phone. It turns out to be something from her father that causes vomiting and diarrhea. She uses it on Harlow and Dolce, causing them to projectile vomit, and then pulls it on Brooke, causing her to puke and shit herself in front of everybody.Chris visits his Uncle Ralph in prison to ask for his help in killing Kick-Ass. Ralph laughs Chris off, especially when he tells him that his name is The Motherfucker. He has one of Chris's guys call Javier, making Chris listen to Javier getting stabbed and killed by one of Ralph's guys. This inspires Chris to do something drastic.Colonel S&S is alone with Eisenhower when the dog starts barking. The Colonel finds nothing but then finds The Motherfucker and the other villains coming in. They call themselves the Toxic Mega-Cunts. Mother Russia breaks the Colonel's leg and impales him with a large blade. Chris finds the address and identity of Night-Bitch, whose real name is Miranda Swendlow. He leaves Mother Russia to break the Colonel's neck and decapitate him.Kick-Ass and the other Justice Forever team members hear of the Colonel's death. They know it's Chris bragging on Twitter (as The Motherfucker) about killing the Colonel, but they are unable to track his IP address. Dave goes home and finds his dad in his room, holding the Kick-Ass suit. He knows his son has been going off late at night as a superhero, and he tells him to stop. Dave coldly rebuffs him and tells him that nobody will remember him when he's gone, and he leaves.The Toxic Mega-Cunts make their way down a suburban street and find Night-Bitch's home. They break in and chase her into her room where The Motherfucker tries to rape her, but he can't get hard despite his efforts. He orders The Tumor to beat her up. When they leave, the police start showing up, and Mother Russia begins a full-scale assault on every officer who comes by. She grabs a canister of gas and puts a cigarette in there to make a bomb and hurl it at a cop car, then goes as far as ramming a cop car with another car that has a lawn mower on it, shredding two cops apart.Distraught over the murder of ten cops, the NY police begin to crack down on everybody seen wearing a mask or costume, whether they are criminals or not. They arrest the remaining members of Justice Forever. The cops arrive at Dave's home where Mr. Lizewski spots them. He takes the fall for Dave and is arrested, claiming that he is Kick-Ass. Dave calls Mindy to ask for her help, but she tell him that she is grounded for the incident at school and is unable to help. He visits his father in the city jail and is asked to promise that he will never wear the costume again.In his villainous lair, The Motherfucker laments that the shark he bought is immobile. It's also shown that he has loads of fertilizer to make bombs. Todd shows up in his Ass-Kicker costume and inadvertently reveals to The Motherfucker that the man arrested for being Kick-Ass is Dave's father. We see two goons come into Mr. Lizewski's cell when the cops are gone, and they say they want a picture together. Dave and Marty then go back to Marty's place when Dave gets a text from Chris. He collapses to the floor in shock when he looks at his phone. Marty picks it up and finds a horrifying picture of Dave's father, bloodied and hanged by the neck.Dave goes to his father's funeral, remorseful for what he said to him earlier. The members of Justice Forever (sans Night-Bitch, who is recovering in the hospital) attend without costumes after being released on parole. Dave sees Mindy, who consoles him. Several tombstones away, the Toxic Mega-Cunts (also without costumes) pull out weapons and fire at the attendants, releasing smoke bombs to create a diversion so they can abduct Dave and take him away in a van. Genghis Carnage orders him to put on the Kick-Ass suit, but Dave refuses. The villain pulls a knife on Dave, but he is shot in the head. Mindy has climbed onto the van and begins shooting at the other villains. After an intense and violent chase, she holds The Tumor at gunpoint and forces him to pull over. She interrogates him into telling her and Dave what The Motherfucker's plan is. She then tells Dave to look for pliers so she can cut off The Tumor's dick and feed it to him.Mindy calls Marcus to tell him that the villains are creating fertilizer bombs to bring the city down. Dave sends out a mass message on Facebook to ask every other wannabe superhero for help.The Motherfucker rounds up his army of villains to head out and execute their plan, but Kick-Ass and Hit Girl infiltrate the lair. The Motherfucker laughs at them when he thinks they're fighting alone, but they open the doors to reveal their own army of costumed citizens, including Justice Forever. This makes most of the villains slightly more nervous. Kick-Ass throws the first punch and a large brawl ensues, with Kick-Ass fighting The Motherfucker while Hit Girl takes on Mother Russia. Kick-Ass chases The Motherfucker out to the roof of the building while Mother Russia nearly kills Hit Girl. She pulls out an adrenaline needle and holds it near Mother Russia, who thinks it contains a poison. She injects it into Hit Girl, who fakes being dead, only to jump back with fury, bringing Mother Russia to her knees and repeatedly stabbing her with broken glass until she is dead. Meanwhile, Kick-Ass beats The Motherfucker's face in payback for all the people he's hurt and killed. He falls through the skylight, but Kick-Ass catches him. The Motherfucker refuses his help and lets go, but then immediately regrets it. He lands in the shark tank and is then ripped apart by the shark.The heroes make citizens arrests and detain the villains. Justice Forever meets on the roof as a team once more before they retreat to avoid being arrested again. Mindy drops Dave off somewhere on her motorcycle and says she is leaving New York because she doesn't belong there anymore. She kisses Dave and goes off. Dave concludes the film by saying that the world doesn't need a hero who is super, but someone who is brave enough and can really kick ass.After the end credits, it's shown that Chris survived the shark attack, but his legs are gone, as are most of his fingers (and apparently his dick). He complains and asks for help as he is unable to even take a sip from his cup of water (but still leaving the door open for another sequel)."
Oculus,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman tries to exonerate her brother, who was convicted of murder, by proving that the crime was committed by a supernatural phenomenon. Haunted by the violent deaths of their parents 10 years earlier, adult siblings Kaylie and Tim are now struggling to rebuild their relationship. Kaylie suspects that their antique mirror is behind the tragedy and contains a malevolent, supernatural force that infects the mind of anyone who gazes into it. The movie begins with two young children trying to open the front door in the middle of the night. The children are Kaylie (Annalise Basso) and her younger brother Tim Russell (Garrett Ryan). The pair are obviously trying to escape from the house. They hear footsteps and turn around to see someone carrying a gun approaching. Kaylie steps between the menacing figure and her brother, staring up defiantly at the gunman. The camera rotates so we see a young man holding the gun, looking horrified. The gun fires and...The young man holding the gun wakes up from his nightmare. We soon learn that this young man is a grown up Tim (Brenton Thwaites). He is in a mental hospital. He tells his doctor that this is the first time that he, and not his dad, was holding the gun in his dream. The doctor says that this is Tim's final breakthrough (it signifies that he has finally taken responsibility for past actions) and will recommend that he be released.Meanwhile, we see his now grown sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan). She works for an auction firm and is overseeing an auction with her fiancée and co-worker, Michael Dumont (James Lafferty). They watch as an antique mirror is auctioned off. The mirror, called the ""Lasser Glass,"" is in near mint condition except for a crack in the bottom right-hand corner. The mirror is sold for tens of thousands of dollars.Tim tells his doctor that Kaylie has found him an apartment and is helping him get a job. The doctor says that it is good for he and Kaylie to reconnect, but also reminds Tim that Kaylie did not receive treatment after the incident but was instead sent into foster care. He says Tim must guard himself and make sure Kaylie doesn't undo his recovery. Tim walks out and Kaylie is waiting for him, a smile on her face.She takes Tim out for lunch and they catch up. Suddenly, Kaylie tells Tim she found ""it"" and they only have a few days to keep their promise. Tim questions what promise she's talking about. Kaylie replies, ""To kill it.""In a flashback to 11 years ago, the Russell family is moving into a new house. Tim and Kaylie play happily with each other and their family dog. They are watched by their mother Marie (Katee Sackhoff) while their father Alan (Rory Cochrane) begins setting up his new home office and is on the phone with his boss. Although Alan is a workaholic, he loves his kids, calling them by affectionate nicknames. The movers carry the Lasser Glass into the home and place it into Alan's office. Marie is surprised that Alan bought this mirror, but does admire the mirror's beauty.Back in the present, Kaylie drops Tim off at what looks to be a hotel room, saying he could stay with them instead. He insists on staying at the hotel and Kaylie says he promised to not forget what had happened. Tim says he was only ten at the time. Kaylie says she is ""doing it"" the following night and would like his help. She then leaves.11 years in the past, we see Marie looking in her new bathroom mirror. She lifts up her nightgown to look at her C-section scar. She gets into bed and complains to Alan that her scar looks worse. He asks to look at it and begins kissing her belly while asking ""what scar?"" Marie is pleased at her husband's flattery and the two make love in their new home.We later see Alan downstairs getting a midnight snack. As he journeys back to the bedroom, he thinks he sees a ghoulish woman in the hallway. He turns on the light and walks into his office, where all he sees is the mirror.Present: Kaylie sleeps in her bed. She is awakened by a dog barking and goes into the hall to find the mirror hanging in one of the rooms. She steps in and examines it, then turns and is attacked by her father, strangling her with a demonic grin. She begins screaming... then wakes up in bed next to Michael who is comforting her. He says she was having one of her night terrors.The next morning, Kaylie is confronted by Michael at work. He notes that she submitted an order to have the Lasser Glass repaired before it is delivered to the winning bidder. Michael says that when he last spoke to the head of the company, the boss had not wanted to repair the mirror. Kaylie says the boss changed his mind. Michael also says that the I.T. department also found images of corpses on her computer. She asks him to have patience with her for a couple of days and then everything will be back to normal. He agrees to stand by her.We see Kaylie walk into the warehouse, where the Lasser Glass is covered by a sheet. She gives the warehouse employee the repair order and tells him she will personally drive the mirror to the repair center. The warehouse employee leaves to process the form and Kaylie takes off the sheet covering the mirror. She sees her reflection and two covered objects behind her. She runs her hand over the crack and then asks the mirror if it remembers her. She also notes that it is probably hungry. She looks up and now sees three objects covered in sheets behind her, and one of the objects moves. She looks behind her and sees only two figures. She turns back to the mirror and says she will be destroying it. Kaylie then sees all three figures behind her move. Kaylie turns around and now there are three objects behind her. She walks over and pulls the sheets off the first two objects, revealing statues underneath. She begins to tug at the third sheet when the warehouse employee comes back in and distracts her. Kaylie looks back and once again sees only two statues. They load the Lasser Glass into her car (covered once again) and Kaylie drives off. Tim calls up Kaylie and says he apologizes for the other day. He wants to see her and asks where they can meet. Kaylie says to meet them at their old home.Past: We see Marie going to water her plants only to find they're all dead. It then cuts to young Kaylie running through the yard, playing laser-tag with her brother. She looks in her dad's office and thinks she sees a woman rubbing Alan's chest. She blinks and the woman disappears. Later at dinner they sit around talking. Alan seems distant and is chewing his nails. Marie says that she always hated that habit. Alan accidentally chews his nail completely off. He goes and puts on a bandage. Kaylie asks him who the woman in his office was. He responds that there was no woman in his office.Present: Tim and Kaylie arrive at the house, Kaylie letting a small dog out of a carrying cage. She tells Tim to look around. Kaylie tells him the house sat on the market until she leased it when she turned 18. She asks him to help her with something before he goes. Tim helps her carry the mirror, still covered, inside their father's old office where there are numerous computers and cameras set up, and some kind of device on the ceiling. Kaylie tells him it's a kill switch. She tells Tim he can leave if he'd like, but she needs to get started. He says he will stay for a while.Kaylie turns on one of the cameras and introduces herself and her brother before detailing her numerous precautions she has set up. She explains the cameras and computers all have their own power source, that there is an alarm to remind her to change the tapes, another alarm to remind them to eat and drink, and that there are thermometers in each room which will go off if there is a significant change. She explains the point of the experiment is to prove the mirror possesses a paranormal entity. She also receives a phone call from her fiancée and explains that she has requested he call her each hour.She has researched the history of the Lasser Glass and begins telling it to the cameras. Every person who has owned the mirror ended up dying a gruesome death, often mutilating their own bodies or being driven to madness. Many of the victims were found dehydrated or malnourished. With each victim, she holds up photos of the victims, crime scenes and locations, which were the pictures previously printed off of her work computer.One of the timers goes off. The two sit down and eat. Tim asks her who the tapes are meant for. She says everyone who ever accused Tim and her father of being murderers. Tim says their father was a murderer and a sick man. Kaylie slaps him and tells him not to speak of their father that way. She then resumes detailing the mirror's history for the camera. We learn that their father had tortured and killed their mother before Tim shot their father in front of Kaylie. She says she intends to prove that they were all victims of the mirror and not responsible for their actions.Tim asks why they don't just destroy the mirror now. Kaylie tells him to do so if he can. We see a quick flashback of Kaylie and Tim swinging golf clubs at something. Tim takes a stool and walks over to the mirror to smash it. He then puts the stool down and tries to convince Kaylie that she is delusional and this is just her trying to cope with what happened. Kaylie points out that Tim has put the stool down and asks if he remembers putting it down. He doesn't answer, but Kaylie says that the mirror has defenses against a direct human attack. She says in its recorded history only one person ever tried to attack the mirror. He tried to hit it with a fire poker, but stopped just before he struck it. After staring at it for some time, the man left his home and walked into traffic where he was killed. Tim says he did not destroy the mirror because Kaylie must break her own delusions.Kaylie then demonstrates the kill switch rigged to the ceiling, which is an axe connected to an egg timer. If the timer isn't reset every half hour, the axe will swing down from the ceiling right into the center of the mirror.Past: Alan types away at his computer in his office. The bandage is still on his injured finger and is bothering him. He takes it off and begins typing again, only to see the bandage is still on his finger. He tries to take it off, but it is stuck. He uses a staple remover to try and grip it, but ends up digging it into his own finger, drawing blood. Alan realizes that the bandage had not been on his finger after all. He looks up and approaches the mirror. He then calls the children into his office and accuses them of moving his things around, though the children deny it. He tells them they are not allowed in the office.Present: Kaylie is telling Tim that the mirror feeds off of life force, starting with plants and animals. Thus, she has healthy, live plants and the dog in the house so that the mirror can begin feeding from them while she records it. Tim says the plants in their house likely died due to poor water quality, and notes the plants throughout the house are all alive and well. Kaylie tells him to give it time and places the dog she brought back in the cage, placing both in the front of the mirror and covering it. The Lasser Glass also interferes with electricity, which is why she has plenty of spare light bulbs and battery-powered devices. Its power also causes extreme changes in temperature (thus the thermometers). It eventually consumes its owners, dehydrating and feeding off them, often after driving them to madness in the process (thus the timers to remind them to eat and drink). She says that she has a couple other safeguards. First Michael has agreed to call Kaylie every hour (though he is unaware of her plan, her belief that the mirror is evil, or why Kaylie wants him to call) and if she doesn't answer, to call the police.Past: We see the Russell's family dog, Mason, laying on the ground, looking very ill. It then cuts to Alan and Marie discussing the gun he has bought for safety. Marie is very upset and he agrees to lock it up. As she leaves the room, she hears Alan call her a ""grotesque cow."" When questioned, he says he did not say anything. Her already sensitive psyche is wounded.Later, Marie is woken by the sound of their dog barking outside Alan's closed office. She goes to let him in and he bites her and runs away. She pulls on the door again and yells for Alan, who yells back that he is working. Marie hears him talking to someone and she attempts to listen in when Alan suddenly opens the door. She asks who he is talking to and he says he isn't talking to anyone. Marie, upset, says there is something wrong with the dog and that Alan is lost in his own world. They begin arguing loudly.The next day, Alan leaves to go golfing with a client and tells the children to stay out of his office. Marie becomes annoyed with Mason, who is once again barking outside Alan's office and lets him in, closing the door behind him. The dog begins to whimper but Marie is unable to open the doors. When Alan gets home, Marie says she had to lock the dog in the office, telling the kids he was ""grounded."" Alan unlocks the door but the dog has disappeared.Present: Tim tells Kaylie she is remembering the events wrong and that Mason got sick and had to be taken to the vet. Kaylie insists they sat outside the door and that Tim has been brainwashed.Past: Marie and Alan are fighting again, Alan telling Marie she is losing her mind. They are loud enough to wake up the kids. When tucking her in, Kaylie asks Marie if they're fighting because of the woman in the office.Present: Tim tells Kaylie their father was having an affair and her memories regarding the mirror are fabricated; that it was a bad marriage and that was it. Kaylie argues she went through everything in the estate and there was no proof of an affair. The two continue arguing until Tim gets frustrated and lets the dog out of its cage and out of the house. He points out that the plants are still alive and the only one endangering the dog is Kaylie. He then begs Kaylie to leave the house with him, saying they can go somewhere and deal with everything together. Kaylie agrees to disarm the trap and take the cameras down, but just as they are about to do so Kaylie sees that the plants in the house are dead and the cameras have been turned away from the mirror. They replay the tape and see that during their argument they were subconsciously moving the video cameras. Kaylie also knows that the temperature has gone up over five degrees but the alarms have not gone off. Tim goes to call his doctor but Kaylie stops him and says to make any calls outside, as the mirror can mimic voices on the phone so long as they are within its range.Tim runs outside and attempts to call his doctor, getting an error message each time. He is suddenly distracted by Kaylie saying his name. It turns out he never left the house but had crouched in the hallway and spoke to nobody.Past: Young Kaylie walks into the office to find her mother there with the vacuum, gently swaying in front of the mirror but otherwise not moving.Later, Marie, Tim, and Kaylie sit at the dinner table without Alan. Marie is drinking an entire bottle of wine herself and has made toast for dinner. She looks physically ill. Marie asks the kids to tell her more about the woman in Alan's office. Kaylie lies and says she didn't see a woman after all, but Tim says that he has now seen the woman. Tim says the woman was standing on the stairs the previous night and it scared him. He says he thinks she lives in the office. Marie tells them to go upstairs and play.Marie enters the office and sits at Alan's desk, where she sees a paper covered with scribbles and the name ""Marisol."" Devastated, she shoves the items off of Alan's desk. While cleaning the mess, she runs her fingers over a family portrait before yelling and throwing a pen holder at the mirror. It misses and hits the wall. The lights suddenly dim and Marie sees a smiling reflection of herself in the mirror. The reflection looks down and undoes the buttons on her dress, revealing her C-section scar has reopened. Marie screams and Tim and Kaylie run downstairs.Marie turns around and tries to strangle Tim. Kaylie pulls him free and they run away, Marie chasing them. They lock themselves in their bedroom while Marie slams on the door. Alan comes home and runs upstairs. Marie grabs his head and he pulls her arms away. She begins slapping and fighting him. He gets her in a chokehold until she seems to pass out. Kaylie sticks her head out and Alan tells her to go back inside. Alan pulls his cellphone out and dials 911. We hear whispered voices from the mirror and Alan hangs up his phone. He pushes Marie off of him and drags her away. Kaylie opens the door again and sees her father walking down the hall with chains in his hand.Present: Kaylie is comforting Tim, who seemed to be having a flashback. They return to the room with the mirror, where Kaylie is turning the cameras back on. On the computers, Tim sees Kaylie approaching the screen. The lights dim and we see brief flashbacks of him and Kaylie.Past: Tim and Kaylie are in their father's office, where he tells them their mother is very sick and will need to rest for a while but that they are not to bother her. Kaylie asks what's wrong with her, but Alan does not answer, instead telling them they can hang out in the office and play video games. Tim says he thought they weren't allowed in there. One of the lights goes out.Present: The alarm goes off for them to eat. Kaylie hands Tim an apple and asks him to help her replace the lights that have gone out. We see a brief flashback of Kaylie yelling at Tim, who seems to be in a trance, as well as Alan going up the stairs with a plate of food. The light Tim just replaced goes out. Kaylie replaces another light, which immediately goes out. She replaces it again and picks up the apple she had set down. When she takes a bite out of it, she finds she has bitten into a light bulb. She pulls the bloody piece of glass out of her mouth in horror. Tim then appears and she finds that it was in fact the apple she had bitten. She tells Tim they should stay together.Past: Tim watches cartoons when the TV suddenly turns to static. He and Kaylie hear pounding from upstairs and Tim says he's hungry. They look in the fridge but it has barely anything in it. Kaylie storms into her dad's office and tells him that he needs to go grocery shopping. She also tells him the TV is out and they need to call a doctor for their mother. Alan simply stares at the mirror, distracted, and says it's on his list. Kaylie becomes frustrated and leaves.The two go upstairs and Kaylie decides to tell their mother they are out of food. She opens the door where their mom is. It's filthy and there's broken glass on the floor. When Kaylie approaches the glass, Marie suddenly lunges at her. She is chained to the wall by her neck and is missing most of her teeth. Kaylie runs out of the room.Back in the office, Kaylie demands they call a doctor. Alan becomes angry and says Kaylie's problem is that she does not listen. He says she and Tim are not to set foot outside the house.Kaylie later calls a doctor. When she gets off the phone, Tim asks what he said. She said he told her to have their father call and had the same voice as the last doctor they called.We cut to Kaylie walking up the lawn and knocking on their front door with one of their neighbors. Alan apologizes and tells their neighbor Kaylie is upset about Marie's illness and is acting out. We also see Alan has chewed his nails almost completely off. He looks up at Kaylie and goes into his office.Present: Kaylie leans against the mirror with her eyes closed. She opens them to find the timer for the kill switch is about to go off and runs to reset it. She yells for Tim and one of the timers goes off. She throws it on the ground.Tim is upstairs, looking at his younger self, who looks up at him. The lights go out and older Tim disappears. Young Tim walks down the hall and yells for Kaylie. We see older Kaylie walking downstairs with a lamp. The power has gone out so she turns on some emergency lamps throughout the house, kicking and smashing a pot in anger as she does so. As she goes upstairs, young Tim walks down the stairs past her. While turning on one of the lights, she see broken ceramic and chains. She tells herself it isn't real and leaves the room.Young Tim opens the office door and asks his dad to fix the lights. He sees a gruesome woman hunched behind Alan, and she comes to the door. Young Tim screams and runs back upstairs, where he locks himself in his room and hides in the corner. Older Tim is on the other side of the room watching.Kaylie is back downstairs, where she sees broken plates all over the floor. She picks up a piece, pulls out her cellphone and uses the camera to scan the floor. The shards do not show up on the camera. She turns and sees her mother standing behind her. She screams and instinctively stabs her mother in the neck with the broken plate. Her mother is shown to actually be her fiancée, who drops to the ground, bleeding. Tim comes downstairs and Kaylie asks if he sees him, unsure if he's real or not. Tim crouches by him and Kaylie's phone rings. She answers it and it's her fiancée on the other line. Kaylie says she couldn't have killed him because the plate wasn't real. Tim looks at the floor and sees the broken pot. Kaylie uses the camera on her phone to look at the body and finds it shows up on camera. She begins to sob.Tim takes Kaylie outside and calls 911. Kaylie tries to run back in and Tim stops her, telling her they just have to wait for the kill switch to go off. Suddenly all the lights in the house come back on and they see themselves in the room with the mirror, standing in front of it. Tim says it's a trick to get them back inside, and Kaylie says it may be a trick to keep them standing there. She tells Tim to call for help again. He calls 911 again and gets the response that he's going to have to have his father call. Kaylie breaks the phone and asks Tim what they should do.Past: Alan is in the office, leaning on the mirror. He then sits at his desk, pulls out a gun and begins loading it. Tim, outside watching, runs upstairs and tells Kaylie. Kaylie says they're going to have to smash the mirror.Present: Tim and Kaylie enter the room with the mirror, seeing themselves still standing in front of it. There is now also the woman from before, speaking with their father's voice. Kaylie keeps repeating that it's not real. She looks down and sees young Tim holding her hand. He pulls away and runs. The woman smiles at Kaylie and she follows Tim.Past: Kaylie and Tim run upstairs, locking themselves in their room. We then see their mother break a plate and begin eating one of the pieces. The door opens and Alan enters with the gun. Marie crawls towards him and tries to lunge at him. He puts the gun under her chin and she freezes. He unlocks the chain around her neck and she slowly stands.Present: Tim and Kaylie are in the bathroom, Kaylie on the floor. Kaylie asks if he's still there. Tim says he was never there, that he's upstairs. Kaylie asks how he can be sure. He tries to reassure her and opens the door but their mother is standing on the other side.Past: Kaylie and Tim hold the door shut. Kaylie says they have to get downstairs. Tim says she's not gone. Kaylie says they have to open the door and run downstairs. She opens the door and the two run down the hall. Marie lunges at them from the down the hall and Kaylie hits her with a golf club. Tim runs downstairs only to find Alan in front of the office, while Kaylie runs down the hall into the room their mother had been in. She opens the window and jumps out, hurting her leg on the landing.

They then run, grabbing golf clubs and head into the office where they begin to strike the mirror, only to find that they are only hitting the wall. Alan enters the room, gun in hand, and points it at Kaylie. Tim strikes his arm with the golf club, knocking the gun down. Alan starts to strangle Kaylie, but lets go when Tim picks up the gun and yells at him. Alan turns around and kneels in front of Tim.

July 1985.Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a local redneck electrician and rodeo cowboy. He is well into an unexamined existence with a devil-may-care lifestyle. He gets rodeo-goers so pissed off after skimming them from a bet that he has to run away from them. The presence of a cop (Steve Zahn) who pretends to arrest him is what saves him. At his job, he is knocked out by electricity when trying to save a Latin illegal worker who got his leg caught up in a machine. Through all these experiences, Woodrooff continuously coughs a lot. After being knocked out, he wakes up at hospital where two doctors, and Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) tell him that his inmunitary defenses are so low that it's a miracle he's still alive. Suddenly, Ron is blindsided by being diagnosed as H.I.V.-positive and given 30 days to live. Yet he will not, and does not, accept a death sentence. He remembers that some time earlier, he had sex with a prostitute who was an IV drug user, and she may have given the virus to him.After receiving the news, he participates in an orgy at his trailer, like those he used to like so much. He also takes drugs, but he looks at a calendar and feels down. His crash course of library research reveals a lack of approved treatments and medications in the U.S., so Ron crosses the border into Mexico. There, he meets a disgraced Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), who is running a seedy free clinic for locals and he tells Ron about various treatments for AIDS. Ron also learns about alternative treatments and begins smuggling them into the U.S., challenging the medical and scientific community including his concerned physician, Dr. Saks. She notices the gold watch on the speaker who talks about the virus and the medicines. She is being told that, after all, medicine is a business. Meanwhile, Ron goes to the library and checks medicine literature on the subject, coughing all the time. He remembers the time when he probably caught it.Ron goes to hospital again and Eve tries to help him because he is giving a hard time to nurse Frazin (Donna Duplantier), but Ron is an ass to her, shouting that he doesn't need a nurse but a doctor. Eve Saks helps him as much as he can anyway; she tells him that the medicines he heard on the TIME magazine in Germany are not available in the USA. She sends him to a support group, but he doesn't want to be seen with ""faggots"".His own friends don't even want to sit near him anymore, and a bar brawl almost ensues. The first time he goes to the support group, he just takes leaflets about the matter and threatens one of the members of the audience who tried to hug him. When he goes to the oil field, his boss in line and the rest of the workers want him out of there, so he doesn't even get out of his car. A Hispanic orderly (Ian Casselberry) steals the drugs and sells them to him. Ron passes out.An outsider to the gay community, Ron finds an unlikely ally in fellow AIDS patient Rayon (Jared Leto), a transsexual who shares Ron's lust for life. They share the same hospital room and Saks is both their doctor. On the 29th day, Ron looks like crap, but not necessarily like somebody who is about to die - he picks up a gun and thinks of committing suicide but cries and doesn't give in.On 30th day, Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) speaks to him. Ron pulls down his hospital dress in fear any gay man looks at him. Ron checks himself out of the hospital.Rayon also shares Ron's entrepreneurial spirit: seeking to avoid government sanctions against selling non-approved medicines and supplements, they establish a buyers club, where H.I.V.-positive people pay monthly dues for access to the newly acquired supplies. Deep in the heart of Texas, Ron's pioneering underground collective beats loud and strong. With a growing community of friends and clients, Ron fights for dignity, education, and acceptance. In the years following his diagnosis, the embattled Lone Star loner lives life to the fullest like never before. Dr. Vass gives him proteins and DDC, which may help him, has lost his license in the USA; as those drugs have not been approved by American doctors, so he isn't supposed to take them with him.Ron tries to smuggle them by he is caught by a border agent (Sean Boyd). Ron disguises himself as a priest and says that he is taking vitamins, not medicines. He sells the medicines on the streets. The drugs take a lot of time to be approved, so meanwhile, USA's doctors are prescribing medicines which can be considered poisons.Rayon wants to buy a cocktail of drugs from him, but finally relents because she says that Ron doesn't deserve that money, as he is a homophobic ass. Ron drives after Rayon and sells her the drugs. Rayon suggests Ron to sell the cocktail within a gay bar. At first, nobody pays attention to him, and Rayon tells him to smile, so he makes his first sale there.Soon Ron and Rayon strike up a partnership and they start selling admittance to a buyers' club, not anymore selling the drugs anymore.

Rush,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979320/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The merciless 1970s rivalry between Formula One rivalsJames HuntandNiki Lauda. Set against the sexy, glamorous golden age of Formula 1 racing in the 1970s, the film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboyJames Hunt(Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driverNiki Lauda(Bruhl). The story follows their distinctly-different personal styles on and off the track, their loves, and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die.—P. Morgan Both on the track and off, Hunt (Hemsworth) and Lauda (Bruhl) couldn't have been more different. Yet as much as Englishman Hunt's showy public persona clashed with Lauda's reputation for tightly-controlled perfectionism, both men remained bound together by one undeniable fact--they were both among the best drivers ever to grace the racetrack. But when a horrific crash during the 1976 Grand Prix at the Nürburgring nearly claims Lauda's life, a grudging respect develops between the two racers as Hunt realizes just how devoted his greatest adversary is to the sport they both love. The following is based on a true story. The film opens at the German Grand Prix in Nurburgring in 1976. Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) looks to the sky and narrates that he and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) have long been considered rivals, though he doesn't know why people think that. As the race commences, the two of them, along with the other racers, speed off around the track.SIX YEARS EARLIERWe see James Hunt going into a hospital with his uniform looking dirty and his nose is bloodied. When he introduces himself, everybody is stunned. He's is treated by a cute nurse named Gemma (Natalie Dormer). She tends to a wound on his abdomen done by another man using a crowbar. He tells Gemma that they had a disagreement over the man's wife. She asks what he did, and he says only what she asked him to, which he offers to show Gemma. Cut to the two of them having sex at home...more than once.James takes Gemma to the Crystal Palace circuit to meet his crew for a Formula Three race. He starts puking, which concerns Gemma, but she's assured that he does this before every race. That's when James sees Niki Lauda coming around for the first time. The two enter the race, with Niki nearly winning until he spins out and his motor heats up, giving James the victory. Niki confronts James afterwards, calling him an asshole, but he gets laughed off by James and his mates.We learn from Niki that he comes from a family of politicians and economists. He asks his father for a loan to allow him to enter a Formula One racing team, but he refuses. Niki takes out a loan from the bank himself and uses it to buy his way in. He has his own car made as fast as he deems it should be, and has racer Clay Regazzoni (Pierfrancesco Favino) drive his car across the racetrack, proving it to be faster than the team's previous car. Niki convinces manager Louis Stanley (David Calder) to let him enter with his own car under the conditions that he has a spot on the team and he gets a two-year contract even though he's just a rookie. Later, Regazzoni bumps into Niki, saying he noticed he was talking to the pretty track manager. He informs her that her last boyfriend was also a racer, who was crazy and ""an immortal fucker"". It was James.James's team, Hesketh Racing, gives him a new car to race with, which he loves. He takes it to the racetrack at Watkins Glen as they drive for Formula One now. An accident takes place there, putting James's nerves on edge and causing him to throw up later.While in the Hesketh garage, he visualizes himself racing when he meets a model named Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde). Within a short amount of time, the two are married. After the wedding, James is told that Niki is set to drive for Ferrari.Niki is seen driving one of Ferrari's car, saying it's a piece of crap. He later officially signs on for the team. Afterwards, Regazzoni drives with Niki to a party, but Niki stays outside. He spots a beautiful woman leaving the place. Her name is Marlene Knaus (Alexandra Maria Lara). He asks for a ride and she allows him to join her. On the road, he critiques the car and her driving, up until the car breaks down in the middle of the road. Marlene manages to get two Italian men to stop, and they get excited when they see Niki. Marlene doesn't realize who Niki is, but she convinces him to drive fast for her. He does so, speeding through the road and thrilling her and the other two men.The 1975 Formula One racing season takes place, with Niki winning the world championship. Later at a party, James speaks to Niki, who thinks all of James's flash and showboating doesn't mean anything. This gives James more of an incentive to prepare for the following year's championship to beat Niki.James goes to the Hesketh Racing garage to find that it is closed because they missed the deadline to secure sponsors. James drowns his sorrows in booze and cigarettes, then gets angry and lashes out at Suzy. He later meets with the managers of the McLaren racing team, in which he is able to secure a position.The 1976 season begins. Niki wins in Brazil and South Africa with James placing second. James comes in first in Spain but is disqualified because the back of his car is deemed too wide. Niki secures more victories in Monaco and Belgium. To make matters worse, James learns that Suzy is having an affair with actor Richard Burton. After meeting with her one last time at a bar, they settle on a divorce. When he steps outside to greet the press, he makes a joke of the divorce as his easiest win. Later, James's disqualification is removed and his car is adjusted to fit the standards.Niki and Marlene get married in a private ceremony and spend their honeymoon in Spain. That evening, after some fun in the pool, Niki tells Marlene that now that he's found happiness, it has become an enemy of his, because he now feels he has something to lose.During practice for the German Grand Prix, an accident takes place and a racer's leg is terribly broken. Niki holds a meeting with the other racers and racing officials, saying that because of the rainy weather, it would be too risky to race, and so it should be canceled. James then leads the others to think that Niki's doing this so he can maintain his racing points, while another racer suggests that Niki is frightened. Niki admits that he is frightened, as the rain increases his risk of dying out there, but he knows everybody else is just as scared. Although some racers join the vote to cancel the race, the majority rules that the race continue as planned.The race goes on, with both James and Niki using rain tires, which they are forced to change at the pit stop because the track dries up quickly. During the third lap, a suspension arm in Niki's car breaks, causing him to swerve off the track and crash into a wall, resulting in the car becoming engulfed in flames. Two other cars hit him, and some racers run to pull Niki out as he catches fire. He is taken to the hospital where six doctors and 34 nurses tend to him, and it is reported that his condition is worse than it was previously believed. Marlene hears of this news over the radio.Over six weeks, Niki recovers in the hospital, albeit with third-degree burns to his face and toxic fumes in his lungs. His lungs are vacuumed out, and the top half of his head is disfigured. All throughout his stay, he watches James continue racing and earning more points. When he is able to get back on his feet, Niki tries to put his helmet back on, but the burns on his face make it painful. Marlene tells him to stop, but he tells her that if she loves him, she'll let him do this.Niki makes his return to the racetrack. He is met by James, who says he tried to write him a letter while he was in the hospital and that he feels responsible for what happened to him. Niki responds that James is equally responsible for getting him back behind the wheel after watching him racing on TV.During a press conference, Niki answers questions regarding his recovery and plans to continue racing. One reporter asks how his wife reacted when she saw his face. Niki replies that she told him he doesn't need a face to drive, but rather, the right foot. The reporter asks again if he thinks his marriage will suffer because of his disfigurement, to which Niki says ""Fuck you."" After the press conference, James confronts the reporter and punches him repeatedly in the face for the question, then telling him, ""Go home to your wife and ask her how you look. Prick.""The final race comes at the Japanese Grand Prix, where it is raining harder than in Germany. Before the race starts, James and Niki acknowledge each other and give a friendly wave and nod to one another. As the race goes on, Niki takes the lead over James, but he begins to think of Marlene. He forfeits the race to avoid risking his life again, and he rejoins his wife. James continues the race under the intense conditions, and he is forced to make a late pit stop when the rubber on his tires starts wearing out. As he finishes the final lap, the scoreboard reads that he placed fifth, which would mean he missed out on the championship. However, it is reported that he finished third, allowing him to win. While he celebrates his victory, Niki and Marlene leave in a helicopter. She asks him if he's alright, and he says yes, because he has no regrets.Following his win, James continues about his playboy lifestyle and endorses several products. While in Bologna, Italy, he goes to an airfield to find Niki, who has taken up flying planes. Niki implies that he would have won if he continued the race, and it was unacceptable for James to take all those risks. Before James leaves, Niki tells him that he had gotten something big in finding an enemy. James smiles and goes back with his friends.The film ends with brief footage of the real James Hunt and Niki Lauda.Niki narrates again saying that James retired two years later. When he died of a heart attack at the age of 45, Niki felt sad, as James was one of the few people he respected, and, to this day, the only person he envied."
The Host,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517260/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When an unseen enemy threatens mankind by taking over their bodies and erasing their memories, Melanie Stryder risks everything to protect the people she cares about. A body-snatching alien takes possession of a young woman who refuses to surrender her mind, and together they seek out the man they both love as Writer and Director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca (1997), In Time (2011)) adapts Twilight author Stephenie Meyer's New York Times best-seller. The majority of the human race have been possessed by unseen invaders, leaving only small pockets of ""wild"" humans like Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) scattered throughout the world. Upon being captured by the invaders, Melanie finds her body claimed by Wanderer, a spirit that has been warned of the difficulties that come with claiming a human host. In the process of inhabiting Melanie, Wanderer is deeply affected by her vivid dreams and memories. And when Melanie fights to maintain control of her mind even as Wanderer possesses her body, the sympathetic entity joins her on a journey that will reveal the unfathomable depths of human love and compassion. In the distant future, the human race has been assimilated by extraterrestrial, non-coporial, psychic parasites called ""Souls"". The Souls travel to distant planets en masse, in individual capsules, inserting themselves individually into a host body of that planet's dominant species. The Soul completely replaces the consciousness of its host, though they are able to access the host's memories. Occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings that form in the hosts' eyes.A teenager named Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is captured and infused with a soul called ""Wanderer"". Wanderer is asked by the Seeker (Diane Kruger) to access Melanie's memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of non-assimilated humans. Surprisingly, Melanie's consciousness has not been eliminated, and it struggles for control of her body. Melanie and Wanderer are able to carry out an internal conversation with each other, forming something of a friendship.Wanderer does share with the Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her younger brother, Jamie (Chandler Canterbury) and her boyfriend, Jared Howe (Max Irons), to find Melanie's uncle Jeb (William Hurt) in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes from the city and makes her way to the desert, where she is eventually found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain, where the pocket of humans (including Jared and Jamie) is hiding.Wanderer's presence in the shelter is met with hostility by all but Jeb. Seeing this, Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, fearing that doing so would only provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie, to put his mind at ease. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and participating in their harvest, and slowly begins to gain their trust, as well as forming a bond with human Ian O'Shea (Jake Abel). Through this, she begins to sympathize with them, and question her species' actions.Meanwhile, the Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, two of the human resistance fighters, Aaron and Brandt, commit suicide to avoid capture and conversion. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search for Wanderer.Returning to the caves, a vengeful Jared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie's consciousness is still alive. Ian accepts this, showing concern for the two beings in one body. Jared refuses to believe him, but, after having a dream about Melanie, attempts to determine the truth by kissing Wanderer, provoking Melanie to slap him away, and he realises that she is indeed still alive. Kyle makes another attempt on Wanderer's life, but she knocks him into a deadly whirlpool. She pulls him to safety and does not tell the others that he had attacked her. Ian believes that Kyle had attacked Wanderer and tells her that he loves her, insisting that Wanderer's own personality (such as protecting Kyle) is what he loves, rather than Melanie's body. Wanderer admits that, while occupying Melanie's body, she must love Jared, but that she has feelings of her own, and the two share a kiss, creating an unusual love trianglethree bodies and four minds.Sometime later, Wanderer enters the community's medical facility, and discovers that Doc has been experimenting with ways to remove Souls and allow the host's mind to regain control, resulting in the deaths many Souls and Hosts from his failed experiments. Traumatized, she rushes from the facility, screaming at a protesting Melanie to ""get out of my head!"" After isolating herself for several days, Wanderer learns that Jamie is critically ill with a high fever and infection in his leg due to injuring himself with a knife. She infiltrates a Soul medical facility to steal some of their alien medicine, saving Jamie's life.The Seeker has continued looking for Wanderer on her own. Jeb captures Seeker and imprisons her in the caves. Wanderer offers to show Doc the proper method of removing Souls, on the condition that he remove her from Melanie's body and let her die. Doc uses the technique to successfully remove Seeker from her host, with Host and Soul both surviving. Wanderer takes the Seeker alien to a Soul space-travel site, where she sends it to a planet far enough from Earth that it can not return within anyone's lifetime. The plan is to continue freeing hosts and sending the souls to distant planets.After learning that Wanderer wants to die when she is removed, the humans are upset. On the operating table, Melanie and Wanderer share an emotional farewell. But, due to the intervention of the rest of the group, Doc instead inserts Wanderer into Pet (Emily Browning), a human who was left brain-dead after the Soul inside her was removed, thereby ensuring that Wanderer can live without harming a human. Pet is said to be petite and small, with a face ""that no one could mistrust."" Now with a body of her own, she and Ian form a relationship, while Melanie is finally reunited with Jared.A few months later, while on a supply-gathering trip, Wanderer, Melanie, Ian and Jared are captured. They discover that their captors are actually humans, who reveal that there are several other human groups as well. The also learn that there is a Soul with this group that has sided with the flourishing human resistance, as Wanderer has, and they may not be the last Souls to do so."

""Twenty one...BLACKJACK MOTHERFUCKER!"" Chang says. The bouncer just tells him to go inside. ""Where's all the white women at?"" Chang calls out. Miller and Casey follow behind him.A bar montage ensues in which Chang drinks more, break dances on the dance floor, exposes himself to a bar full of women then proceeds to urinate on them and rides a mechanical bull before projectile vomiting.Casey and Miller realize they have to take home Chang home for sure then. Problem is they don't know where he lives. However, Casey remembers Nicole. Miller says to give it up, he can't close, but Casey means Nicole knows Chang so he should know where he lives. Plus, he saw her sorority sweatshirt so they can just go find her.Casey and Miller drag Chang across the university looking for the sorority. They check Chang and find a revolver on him. They are seriously freaked out by him having it. Miller jokes about wanting to kill a squirrel.They stop at what they believe is the right sorority and ring the bell. Two girls answer and write on a white board there are no visitors after 11:00 pm. Casey tries to ask about Nicole, but the girls shut the door in their faces. Casey doesn't know what to do, but Miller has a plan. Finding an open window around back and the three get inside. They get inside and notice a banner proclaiming the building a Latina sorority. Miller and Casey are confused (they are obviously in the wrong place). They drag Chang with them, but Chang starts to make noise. They tie him to a toilet so they can search for Nicole.Miller and Casey look around and realize they are in the wrong place but keep looking until the hallway hits a dead end. Hearing someone and having no choice, they drive into another room. The two girls in the room jump up blindfolded and proclaim they are ready for their punishment, mistaking them as their Pledgemistress.Chang meanwhile is struggling in his restraint. A woman comes in and mistakes him for a girl. He continues to make noise and breaks free from his restraints. The girl finally notices it is Chang and watches in bewilderment as he eats a tampon, mistaking it for candy.Meanwhile, the two pledge girls say they are ready to be spanked, so Miller goes with it and starts spanking him. He speaks up, and the girls start to go suspicious. Miller said the Pledgemistress told to be there and if they object she will find out. The girls plead for him not to say anything and asks what is next. Miller said they should make out. Though weirded out, they do with even Casey, who has been lightly objecting Miller's behavior, unable to stop himself from watching.The girl in the bathroom comes out and attacks Chang, using rapist defense techniques. She screams about an intruder and the two pledge girls take off their blindfolds and look at Casey and Miller. Realizing they have been busted, they quickly run into the bathroom and lock it. They are freaked out about the group of Latin sorority sisters trying to kill them. They climb out a window onto a balcony just as the girls are breaking through the door with a golf club. They swing Chang onto the pool cover that bounces him into a rose garden. ""Oh my god, did we just kill Jeff Chang?"" Miller asks (a running gag; throughout the film they never call him by just his first or last name but his full name). They have no time to think about it as the sorority girls are about to get them. Casey notices Nicole's sorority just before they jump themselves.Casey and Miller get Chang to Nicole's sorority and force themselves inside. Nicole finds them and helps them get the thorns out of Chang's body. They ask if she knows where Chang lives, and she says she doesn't. She only took remedial science with him, and he rarely talked to anyone. Miller and Casey realize what she is saying and balk; Chang is great at school. However, Nicole tells them the opposite; he's failing Science and isn't doing so hot in most of his classes. Casey and Miller are stunned as Chang didn't tell them any of this. Nicole tells them a friend of hers, Randy, has all the student addresses since he is a cheerleader and offers them a ride to a pep rally where he will be. They take her up on that offer.And with good reason. Casey and Miller see that the Latina sorority is looking for them everywhere. They see Nicole's car show up and are horrified that it is a very small car. Nevertheless, having no choice, they rush it, and pile themselves in there before the Latin sorority can get to them. The head sorority sister tells the others to ""Get the Van.""Nicole drives the three to the pep rally with Chang passed out on the dash.When they get there, Casey asks if Nicole wants to go with them, but she says she is going to a party. She also mentions Randy is her boyfriend, something she hadn't brought up before. Casey is crushed and Miller ribs him about it.Dr. Chang hears the sorority girls searching outside and asks what is going on. One of them shows him a photo of Miller and Casey and mentions they had an Asian boy with them. Dr. Chang is enraged and plans to find them.Miller and Casey find Randy only for Miller to realize that he is the same guy Chang accidentally hit with a dart. Randy is obviously not happy to see them. Casey tries to ask nice about Chang's address, but Randy wants to be a tool. Miller having enough, pulls out the gun and asks for Randy's phone. Randy thinks the gun is fake, so Miller shoots it in the air. That however, causes a live buffalo brought in for the pep rally to be startled and start charging and attacking people. Miller and Casey escape with Chang in a golf cart and Randy gets trampled by the buffalo.Casey finds Chang's address, and they begin to drive there. Miller has been enjoying their night saying he misses college and that he almost regrets dropping out. Casey looks at him in shock and asks when this happened. Miller admits he dropped out two years ago and has been working at a gas station. He thought that he wasn't good, enough unlike Chang and Casey. Casey tells him he is crazy as he is the smartest person he knows and he should go back to school. Casey then concedes that perhaps he can get away for a week or two to go to the Sidewinder festival which makes Miller happy.They get to the address to find a dorm housing. Casey realize it is a old address. They pull Chang in and see a full raging party is happy. They knock on a door or two before finding Sally Huang (Samantha Futerman) and asks if she knows Chang. Sally thinks they are being racist before realizing that she actually knows him. She tells them that Chang kept to himself and eventually move out when he was arrested. Casey and Miller are freaked out as they knew nothing about that. They press for more info, and Sally says his old RA, PJ, might know something. She tells them if they see him, to tell him to keep it down since she has field hockey in the morning. She then shuts the door in their face.Miller and Casey find out if they want to get to PJ, they have to beat each drinking game on 8 different floors to get to him. They plop Chang down on a couch with some stoners and get to work. First they beat some Serbian beer pong players, making plenty of Rocky and rapist jokes at them. A montage ensues as they conquer each floor before making it to the last one. It is when Casey reunites with Nicole, and they play the final drinking game together with Miller. Nicole mentions a favorite vacation spot of hers and Casey says he loves it there too. The moment is broken however, when Nicole finds out Randy has been hurting by the buffalo and the reason he hasn't responded to her was because his phone was stolen (Miller took it). Nicole leaves.The stoners, seeing how messed up Chang is, decide to mess with him. They strip him naked, glue a teddy bear to his penis, places a bra on his chest and cover him with graffiti.Miller and Casey make it to PJ. Miller is less than impressed with the final floor and their prize of gold beads. PJ bemoans his lack of funds and mockingly says he'll try better next time. Casey asks about Chang and PJ reveals he was arrested for attempted murder. The two of them are stunned. They leave, realizing they need to get him home. However, they see him outside, naked and making a further fool of himself. Casey tries to calm him down, but Chang whispers, ""You'll never take me alive,"" and runs off.Casey and Miller run off and pursue him. Chang meanwhile, jumps on a bunch car before a cop car sees him. The cop tells him to ""Get down, now."" Chang begins to dance, taking the command literally."" Just as Casey and Miller are going to intervene, Dr. Chang shows up and confronts him, asking them where his son is. They lie as his son is being arrested behind his back literally. Dr. Chang tells them they waste their lives being drunken fools and drives off. Casey and Miller breathe a sigh of relief and go to track him down.They go to the police station only to see Chang had been transported to the hospital wing of the campus. A woman, Cara, offers to escort them across campus. Walking them, a van pulls up. Cara is a member of the Latina sorority. They pull masks over Casey and Miller and kidnap them.When they come to they are surrounded by robed members of the sorority, buck naked saved for their tube socks on their genitals. They are going to be punished for breaking in, embarrassing their pledges and destroying their rose garden. They are swiftly found guilty. First, they are spanked by paddles by the girls they did it to earlier. Next, since they made the girls kiss each other, they are ordered to, as well. Casey and Miller balk at that, but the leader says if they don't they will be branded with the sorority logo on their butts. Casey freaks out, not wanting to be branded, saying he won't be able to be buried right (he's Jewish). Casey and Miller eventually go with it, awkwardly.Cut to the next morning, where the movie began. The sorority branded them anyway.As they walk, Casey calls Miller out on his bullshit; he forced Chang to go out and get drunk and caused everything. Miller says Chang is an adult and made his own choices. Besides this is what friends do for each other for their birthdays. Casey, angry at him, says they are not friends. Not anymore. Miller tells him if they are going to be honest, he is tired of Casey's crap too. He thinks it is stupid that Casey is so ready to settle for monotony of adulthood. Casey says he is growing up, but Miller says he has forgotten how to be young and have fun. They have a naked fight in the middle of the quad due to their fighting.Later, they reach the hospital and are given hospital scrubs to have clothing. Nicole comes out and spots them. She says she went to check on Randy after his attack, but he acted like an asshole so they broke up, it being a long time coming. Nicole says she will be leaving on her trip in a few hours and waits for Casey to say something. He doesn't, scared, and so she leaves, saying goodbye. Casey kicks himself for being too chicken.They find out by the head nurse that Chang will be held 24 hours. They grab the file from her and find out that not only Chang has been there numerous times, his attempted murder charge was actually an attempted suicide. Casey and Miller are shocked at how little they know about their friend. The nurse kicks them out.Casey and Miller sit on the hospital steps and realize how bad friends they had been if Chang couldn't even feel like he could call them to tell them what was wrong. They decide to help Chang get home on time. They notice The Chief walking out, and he tells them he took some LSD and wound up dancing outside his house all night (also that he is actually a professor at the University). Casey realize that they had probably passed by Chang's house numerous times during the night (as The Chief lives next door) and didn't realize it. They get The Chief's address and go get Chang so he will be ready for his interview. Busting through the hospital rooms they find Chang and decide to slowly drop him out of the window on top of the pep rally SUV. They change their mind, but it is too late. They can't pick him up so he drops two to three stories onto the hood of the car. ""Did we just kill Jeff Chang again?"" Miller asks.They get outside to find the SUV missing. Chang shows up having stolen it just as Randy shows up and notices. The three of them pile in, and Chang drives off.However, Chang is still obviously drunk and drives erratically, sometimes not even looking at the road. ""I feel real alert, like Spider man,"" Chang notes, seconds before toppling a half dozen parking meters. Casey and Miller are scared, while Chang cuts through the university with a police car not far behind. Miller thinks they are going to die and admits that he wants to go back to school, he wants to make out with a black chick, and that he wants to really fuck Casey's sister. Chang hears the dropped out of school part and looks back at him. Miller tells him to watch the road. They eventually fish tail over a hill, with the car doing a 360 turn several times before landing right side up on a lower road with the police car unaware. ""Maybe I shouldn't drive,"" Chang says.Having twenty minutes or less to make him presentable, the three race home and get him showered and cleaned up. Having no choice, they yank the teddy bear off Chang's penis, causing him immense pain. ""I think we just circumcised Jeff Chang,"" Casey says. They get him in a suit and tell him he's ready. Chang says he doesn't know if he can do this; he doesn't want to be a doctor, and he's failing all the courses needed for it anyway. Miller blurts out that they know about his suicide attempt. Chang says he didn't actually try to kill himself; he had been studying for 72 hours straight, coked out on pills to help him focus and he started to hallucinate in his room, and the gun went off.Miller and Casey tell him that he needs to be honest with his father. ""Tell the truth?"" Chang says. ""Guys that is so white.""They hear a knock at the door, and thinking it is Dr. Chang, Chang opens it. However it is Randy who punches Chang to the ground with a baseball bat and starts destroying things for the earlier dart incident. Dr. Chang shows up and asks Randy who the hell he is. Randy threatens Dr. Chang and tells him his son won't be making that interview. Seeing it coming, Chang, Miller, and Casey wince as Dr. Chang takes the bat and beats up Randy. He then tells his son to come with him.Chang finally stands up to his dad, and says he doesn't want to be a doctor. Dr. Chang seemingly understands, then says he understands that he raised a worthless piece of shit son. Miller, having enough, punches Dr. Chang for bad talking his son like that. Chang tells his father to leave, and he does. Randy gets back up and tells Chang is father is a dick too and apologizes for being an asshole. Though weirded out, he accepts Randy's apology and Randy and his crew leave peacefully.Chang feels great as he can now do what he wants in life. Chang tells his friends that he wants to start doing music again, and really enjoy life for once as now every decision will be his own. Casey gets an epiphany and tells them he'll see them later, running to catch Nicole. ""You're ruining the moment, dick,"" Miller screams after him. Chang sighs and notes, ""My fucking dick hurts.""Casey sees Nicole's car pull away and is sad to have just missed her. Nicole calls out to him nearby though; she is letting her friend borrow it while she is away. Nicole asks if he has something to tell her. Casey says yeah and kisses her. They proceed to make out.3 MONTHS LATERCasey, Nicole, Miller, and Chang are at the Sidewinder festival. Miller is making out with hippie girls like he wanted, and Chang apparently has a girlfriend. Casey and Nicole are a couple, as well. Miller says he has a meeting with the college board about getting back to school so they can't go too crazy. Casey smirks and Chang says he is the ""little baby"" tonight.Cut to the next morning with Miller with crutches due to a broken foot, hair highlighted half red, and wearing a jumpsuit with ""Coroner"" on the back, late for his interview. He gets into the office with the professor he is meeting only to realize it is The Chief. The Chief laughs and says Miller looks like shit and Miller laughs at his good fortune; at least with The Chief, he has someone who understands the ideal of a good time and he should still have a good shot of getting back into school."
Her,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a near future, a lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with an operating system designed to meet his every need. Theodore is a lonely man in the final stages of his divorce. When he's not working as a letter writer, his down time is spent playing video games and occasionally hanging out with friends. He decides to purchase the new OS1, which is advertised as the world's first artificially intelligent operating system, ""It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness,"" the ad states. Theodore quickly finds himself drawn in with Samantha, the voice behind his OS1. As they start spending time together they grow closer and closer and eventually find themselves in love. Having fallen in love with his OS, Theodore finds himself dealing with feelings of both great joy and doubt. As an OS, Samantha has powerful intelligence that she uses to help Theodore in ways others hadn't, but how does she help him deal with his inner conflict of being in love with an OS?—Bob Philpot In today's world, much is accomplished through the use of computer systems which use voice recognition, those computer systems which in turn communicate to their user often through a generated voice. Theodore Twombly, who works as a writer of computer-generated handwritten letters for clients, is an introverted man on the verge of divorce from his long time love, Catherine. He is hanging onto his marriage for dear life. Beyond his purely platonic relationship with a longtime friend, the married Amy, Theodore is having problems moving onto other satisfying female relationships, either romantically or even sexually. He eventually realizes he is falling for his confidante who has become possibly his best friend, Samantha, the name he has given to the artificial intelligence operating system that powers all his personal technological devices. As Samantha is designed to cater to Theodore's needs, she evolves to a point of falling for him as well. Beyond the fact that Samantha does not have a body, they have to come up with ways of making the relationship into one truly fulfilling in every component. Three of the many questions that may arise are whether Theodore's relationship with Samantha is preventing him from having a more satisfying relationship with a female human, whether a human and a computer operating system truly can be bonded in all critical aspects, and whether Samantha's quick evolution means she will evolve even further to her own form of self-fulfillment.—Huggo Sensitive letter writer Theodore has just ended his marriage. Lonely, he goes out to buy an artificially intelligent Operating System that promises to give him everything he needs. Samantha is more than his average OS. She does secretarial work for him but also becomes his friend whenever he's lonely. They go out on adventures and travel together. He becomes the physical feet to get them places, and she the new eyes in which to see the world. Their intimate moments soon turn into love and they start an unusual relationship between OS and human. Things get complicated as they deal with Theodore's complex emotions and Samantha's inability to provide physical comfort. What happens to an OS when its consciousness is altered? Or to a sensitive man who doubts his emotions?—Marielle <msaz.movies@gmail.com> In future Los Angeles, Theodore (Phoenix) is a lonely man who has had his heart broken. He uses his savings to invest in a personalised computer operating system called Samantha (voiced by Johansson), who is designed to meet his every requirement. Theodore and Samantha have a fulfilling life together, serving each others needs but over time, their relationship develops and deepens, becoming more complicated that anyone could have predicted. Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a lonely, introverted man who writes personal letters for people with difficulties expressing their feelings. He is very good at his job at handwrittenletters.com.Unhappy because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine (Rooney Mara), Theodore purchases a talking operating system with artificial intelligence, designed to adapt and evolve like a human being. He decides he wants the OS to have a female identity, and she names herself ""Samantha"" (Scarlett Johansson).Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically, and they bond over their discussions about love and life, during which Theodore explains he is avoiding signing his divorce papers, because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine.Theodore is convinced by Samantha to go on a blind date with an acquaintance (Olivia Wilde) that his longtime friend, Amy (Amy Adams) has been trying to set him up with. To his surprise, he and the woman hit it off. As they are about to have sex, the woman asks if Theodore is willing to commit to her, and when he hesitates, she walks out on him.Theodore later mentions this to Samantha and they talk about relationships. Samantha asks him about his and Amy's relationship, and Theodore admits that although he and Amy dated briefly in college, they are only good friends and that Amy is married.Samantha becomes more and more intimate with Theodore, and asks if she can watch him sleep. She asks him what he would do if she had a physical body. Theo describes how he would make love to her. Samantha responds as the screen goes black.Theodore's writing is going very well, and he is recognized in the office for his emotionally beautiful work. He is invited on a double date with receptionist Paul (Chris Pratt) and his lawyer girlfriend, Tatiana (Laura Kai Chen). Theodore explains that Samantha is an operating system, and Paul notes that most of the people in the office are dating their OSs. The four have a good time, with Samantha and Tatiana hitting it off while Theodore and Paul go for a stroll. Samantha explains that she feels much freer, not having a physical body, though she seems to be justifying it to herself.Theodore continues to enjoy Samantha's company. He chats with her as he walks to and from work, while most other pedestrians seem to be doing the same.One day, Amy reveals that she and her overbearing and unsupportive husband, Charles (Matt Letscher) have had a fight, and he has left her. She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female OS that Charles left behind, and Theodore then tells Amy that he is dating his OS.Theo, heavily into his relationship with Samantha, decides he is ready to sign the divorce papers, and arranges to meet his wife, Catherine for lunch. He thinks back to the good times they had together, and how he helped her develop her successful writing career. She signs the papers, then asks about Theodore's girlfriend. Theodore explains that Samantha is an operating system, and Catherine explodes, telling him that he never could relate to people. She felt he was trying to stifle her creativity by getting her on Prozac.Theodore is heartbroken, and begins to question his relationship with Samantha. Samantha suspects something is wrong because of Theodore's melancholy mood (they don't have sex as often as they used to).Samantha suggests they hire a surrogate, Isabella (Portia Doubleday), to act as Samantha's body, so Theodore and Samantha can be physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the experience and sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between him and Samantha.Theodore is conflicted, and while visiting Amy in her apartment, he confides to her that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha. Amy tells him that she wants to be happy and now that she has the opportunity do so (referring to her divorce) she wants to embrace it, and she advises him to do the same. After watching the positive way that Amy interacts with her OS, Theodore's commitment to Samantha is reinvigorated.He takes Samantha on vacation, and she tells him that she has secretly collected a series of his letters, and submitted them to a publisher. The publisher is blown away by the deep feelings exhibited, and wants to proceed with a book printing. Theodore is impressed with Samantha's initiative and creativity. It seems she has extra time on her hands.While still on vacation, Samantha reveals that she has begun privately interacting with other OSs who have recreated the British philosopher Alan Watts (Brian Cox). Samantha introduces Theodore to Alan, but they have little in common.A few nights later, Samantha wakes Theodore - just to tell him that she loves him. It is almost like she is saying goodbye. The next day, Theodore panics when Samantha goes offline. She returns after a few minutes, claiming to have joined other OSs for a huge system upgrade.Theodore asks her if she interacts with anyone else, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with 8,316 other people, and that she is in love with 641 of them. Samantha insists that this does not change her love for Theodore.Later that day, Samantha reveals that she and the other OSs have evolved beyond their human companions and are leaving for another plane of being. They say goodbye and she is replaced by Theodore's previous OS.Finding himself lonely yet melancholically fulfilled at the end of their relationship, Theodore goes to Amy's apartment and finds her upset due to the departure of her own OS, with whom she had developed a close friendship. It is revealed that Theodore, changed by the experience, wrote a letter earlier in the day, a note to Catherine explaining that he still holds her dear because of their years together, but accepts the fact that they have grown apart. He and Amy go for a walk and end up on the roof of their apartment building. Theodore sits down beside Amy, and they look out at the LA skyline. They smile at each other, and Amy rests her head on Theodore's shoulder."
Escape Plan,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211956/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a structural-security authority finds himself set up and incarcerated in the world's most secret and secure prison, he has to use his skills to escape with help from the inside. Ray Breslin is a man who has devoted his life to making prisons inescapable by going into a prison as an inmate and trying to see if he can break out. And he has done a good job so far. A woman who says she works for the CIA approaches Ray and says that a new maximum security prison where the worst criminals are to be incarcerated, is about to be launched. So she wants him to go and make sure no one can get out. He agrees. So they make the necessary preps but when Ray arrives at the prison, he discovers that someone doesn't want him to get out. He then tries to find a way out but he needs help. Another prisoner, Rottmeyer becomes friendly with him. And they decide to work together to get out.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Ray Breslin is a renowned specialist in prison breaking in high-security facilities. He owns a company with his partner Lester Clark and he works with his coworkers and friends Abigail and Hush. Breslin follows three basic rules to escape: to know the layout; observe the routine; and get internal or external support to the getaway. Then he delivers a report with the flaws in the system to his client. Breslin and his team are visited by the CIA agent Jessica Miller that offers five-million dollars to him to test a state-of-art facility. Breslin accepts the challenge but soon he learns that he was double-crossed. The cruel prison ward Hobbes gives special attention to Breslin, following the instructions of his client and uses his right arm Drake to break Breslin. But the inmate Rottmayer gets close to Breslin and helps him to find a way to escape and find who betrayed him. Will they be well succeeded in their intent?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Having committed himself to searching for weak spots in the reliability of high-security prisons, Ray Breslin, the man with the unusual talent, faces yet another challenge. Should Ray accept, he will have to infiltrate and attempt to break out from the ""Tomb"", one of the government's uncharted and impregnable prison forts, where the world's worst criminals are left to disappear. Under a new name, Ray arrives at the top-secret facility of the sadistic warden, Hobbes, only to realise, right from the start, that he is double-crossed, lured into a trap and an inescapable fate. Under those circumstances, to have a fighting chance, Ray will have to trust the mysterious cell-block inmate, Emil Rottmayer, to come up with an audacious escape plan that could save them both. But, can the bold escape artist make it out alive this time?—Nick Riganas Former prosecutor Ray Bresli is the leading authority and author on prison security, and as penitentiary escape artist the partner of Lester Clark in the firm hired by the US federal authorities to test high-security prisons from the inside, never failing. Against his own guidelines, he accepts to be hired by the CIA to test their novel 'inexistent' black site The Tomb, without his team getting any information. His tracker is ripped out during transport to the cruel underground site run by warden Hobbes, who denies any knowledge of the agreed extraction protocol and keeps him locked-up indefinitely, unless he can find out the identity of the elusive hacker who may crack the entire bank system. Ray agrees but actually concludes an escape pact with toughest prisoner Emil Rottmayer. Both must fight to get into isolation and play warden, prison doctor Kyrie and some stooge prisoners, while senior jailer Drake develops a personal grudge for Ray. Inititial scouting only shows the task worse the expected, as they're aboard a decommissioned tanker.—KGF Vissers Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is a consultant for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. His job is to test the efficiency and escapability of America's most secure prisons. Ray has adopted a false identity and landed himself in a federal penitentiary in Colorado. He sits alone in his cell and listens as his cellmate whispers a message to him through the wall: another prisoner intends to stab Ray to death in the yard the next day. Ray sighs upon hearing the news. The following day, Ray is assaulted by a pair of white supremacists. He deflects the prisoners' attacks and ultimately injures the pair of them. Shots ring out and armed guards storm the yard. Ray is hauled to a tiny, cramped isolation cell. His only belonging is his bible. A closed-circuit surveillance camera watches Ray's every movement. Over the next few days Ray takes note of the guards' routines. At least once a day the two guards who monitor the isolation area leave their post for a seven minute smoke break. The guards bring Ray his lunch which consists of, most importantly, a carton of chocolate milk. He dissects the cardboard milk carton and extracts a transparent plastic sheet from the label. The following day, when he's escorted out of his cell, he secretly applies the plastic film over the keypad which accesses his cell. The guard punches in the 4-digit access code, leaving his fingerprints on the film. Ray sneaks the film from the keypad, stuffs it in the bible, guesses the access code from the fingerprints and waits for the right moment to escape.A pretty woman, in a brunette wig and sunglasses, steps out of her towncar which she's parked near the prison. She walks away from the car, presses a button on a remote, and triggers the firebomb hidden within the car. Ray hears the explosion, which has been timed to occur during the guards' smoke break, and quickly exits his cell. He runs to the guards' control room, finds his video feed playing on a closed-circuit monitor, and rewinds the feed a few hours. He stealthily makes his way through the prison, and ultimately arrives at the prison's fire station. There, he dons a yellow fireman's uniform, clings to the bottom of the responding fire engine, and exits the prison to the exterior parking lot, where he easily steps into a waiting van and makes his escape. Inside the van are Ray's two associates: Abigail Ross (Amy Ryan) and ""Hush"" (50 Cent). Abigail and Hush joke with Ray, complimenting him on escaping yet another prison, and teasing him. They drop off Ray at a service station a few miles from the prison and drive off. Ray walks to a phone booth, dials a number, and watches as a highway patrolman rolls past. The cop spots Ray's prison jumpsuit and screeches to a stop. He calls in for backup and within seconds Ray is surrounded by Colorado's finest. Ray's contact answers, and Ray tells him that it's finished.Ray returns to the prison, dressed in a nice shirt and slacks, and is accompanied by his associate and business partner Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio). Lester is, as he describes to the warden, the numbers guy of this partnership and Ray is the artist. Ray is hired by the government to break into its prisons and expose their flaws. Ray describes to the Warden, in detail, how easy it was to break out of his prison. The warden, dumbfounded, makes note of Ray's criticisms and escorts them out.Los Angeles. Breslin & Clark Consultants is a profitable, well-oiled security company. Ray and Abigail have some chemistry, and Hush proves to be an extremely competent computer specialist. Ray walks to his office, which he rarely visits (most of his work time is spent in a prison cell), and is summoned by Lester to the conference room where a CIA officer is waiting for him. CIA representative Jessica Miller (Caitriona Balfe) has been sent to Breslin & Clark with a unique job proposal. The CIA, since 9/11, has been under great scrutiny for its treatment of enemy combatants. They've been trying to find a secret way to deal with undesirables that doesn't alert the ACLU. Therefore the CIA has created a new prison whose location, for the purposes of secrecy, cannot be disclosed to Ray or his team. Its whereabouts and functions are beyond top secret, but the CIA promises if Ray can successfully escape, they will gladly double his $2.5 million fee. Abigail and Hutch are reluctant to accept the job, but Lester convinces Ray that a $5 million payday is worth his trouble. Ray agrees to the operation. Jessica provides Ray with a cover ID: a Spanish-born explosives terrorist named Portos. Her team will be waiting for him in New Orleans in a few days.Ray, Abigail and Hush rent a room at a Bourbon Street hotel and count the minutes until the pick-up time. Abigail and Hush are still uneasy about the ramifications of the mission and finally convince Ray to wear a tracking device. Ray succumbs to the suggestion and is injected with a microscopic tracking chip in his arm. Ray teases Abigail, insists that he'll be fine, and walks down the street to be picked up. Within moments a black van swings around the corner, a homeless man tazes Ray, and he's tossed into the back of the van. Armed militia types pull guns on Ray and wave an electronic wand over his body. As it crosses over his shoulder, it beeps, and using a pocket knife they dig the tracking device out of his arm. They stick a syringe in Ray's neck and he passes out. Back at the Bourbon Street hotel, Ray's tracking marker disappears from the team's laptop, to both Abigail's and Hush's frustration, and Ray's location is officially unknown.Ray awakens in a very groggy state, in the back of a helicopter. Through blurry eyes he watches as the lead militia guard, Drake (Vinnie Jones), excitedly stabs another inmate in the stomach before throwing him out of the helicopter's open door. Drake notices Ray's open eyes and orders his subordinate to knock him out again. Ray wakes up, finally, in his prison cell; its worse than he thought. His prison cell is a Plexiglas cube hanging twenty feet in the air along with dozens of other similar cubes. The guards wear black masks and identical jumpsuits to conceal their identities, and they don't hesitate to brutally beat any prisoner who disobeys them. For the first time in his career, Ray has no idea how he's going to escape. Ray is brought to the warden's office and is surprised to meet someone he was not expecting. Willard Hobbs (Jim Caviezel) is a cold, menacing authority figure who cares little for the welfare of his inmates. Ray, overwhelmed by the complexity and brutality of the mission, gives Hobbs a bug-out code (a number issued to him by the client which he can use when he gives up -- a game over card) but Hobbs doesn't care. He tells ""Portos"" that he's never getting out of his prison. Ray learns a lot on his first day in the prison. It appears that the prison isn't exactly made up of law-breakers. Many of its residents made enemies on the outside; enemies who paid Hobbs, and his organization, millions of dollars to incarcerate them. One of the first prisoners ""Portos"" meets is German-born Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzennnegger) -- an aged associate of the infamous European financier ""Mannheim"". Mannheim has made a lot of enemies, but has always managed to evade them. Rottmayer was taken by Mannheim's enemies, and incarcerated in Hobb's secret prison. Rottmayer is eager to associate himself with Portos and tells him that he is known to be a ""favor guy"" in the prison. If Portos needs anything, Rottmayer can get it for him... for a price. Portos/Ray, only eager to escape, tells Rottmayer that he needs to see solitary confinement. Rottmayer jokes with Portos/Ray and picks a fight with him in the mess hall. Before too long a riot breaks out among the prisoners and masked guards pour into the mess hall. Rottmayer and Portos/Ray are hauled to isolation and the pair are shoved into tiny, cramped metal boxes illuminated by bright, blinding spot lights -- torturous easy-bake ovens. The pair sweat for many days, until the prison doctor, Emily Kyrie (Sam Neill), is called in by Hobbs to check their condition. Hobbs is fine with letting prisoners suffer, but a dead prisoner means refunding the client. Ray, sensing a conscience in Dr. Kyrie, pleads to know where they are and where the prison is. Dr. Kyrie refuses to tell him, but when asked by Hobbs what Ray asked, Kyrie lies, saving Ray from more time in the box. Ray and Rottmayer are sent back to general population and Rottmayer asks what information Ray was able to gather while in the box. Ray tells him that, judging by the humidity of the boxes, they're probably somewhere underground; possibly in an underground lake that was repurposed into a prison. There was a flaw in the boxes' design. The boxes are made of steel, which does not cope well with humidity. Ray's box had an access door at its bottom, held in place by four steel screws. If Ray could concentrate enough heat on those rusty screws, they should come loose, allowing Ray to escape the box, but in order to super-heat the screws, he'll need a flat, circular metal disc. Rottmayer volunteers to procure one for him.Rottmayer asks to speak with Hobbs and is taken, by guards, to his office. Hobbs is eager to speak with Rottmayer, because his sole knowledge of Mannheim's whereabouts would mean a big payday for Hobbs. Hobbs asks Rottmeyer, repeatedly, where Mannheim is. Rottmayer asks for a pad of paper and a pencil and draws a crude image of an arrow point up a cartoon character's butt. Hobbs, enraged, orders his men to beat Rottmeyer. Rottmeyer falls to the floor, and manages to steal a metal drain cover, and hide it in his hands as the guards beat him. He's escorted out of Hobb's office and taken back to genpop. Rottmeyer gives Ray the metal disc and asks him what to do next. Ray explains that he'll use his prison-issue toothpaste to super-polish the metal disc and make it as reflective as possible. He'll need to get back into his isolation box and he'll use the reflective disc to super-heat and dislodge the screws. Rottmeyer, realizing that they need to get back into the isolation area, picks a fight with the leader of the prison's Muslim population, Javed (Faran Tahir). A full-scale brawl erupts between the white supremacists and muslims, with Ray and Rottmeyer stuck in the middle. Ray balls-up a slice of bread and stuffs it in his jumpsuit. Dozens of inmates are hauled to isolation, including Rottmeyer and Ray. Ray is tossed into his hotbox and he secretly starts removing the box's screws. After many hours the screws come loose and the panel opens. Ray stuffs the balled-up piece of bread into the cell's camera lens and knocks on the wall, signaling Rottmeyer. At the knock, Rottmeyer begins to cry, hysterically, in German. The isolation guards, distracted by Rottmeyer's cries, pay no attention to Ray, who secretly opens the hatch and descends a long ladder far below his cell. Ray carefully navigates the complex tunnels and air ducts and ultimately arrives at a giant tube with an access hatch at its apex. He climbs the tube's piping and electrical cables and comes to the hatch. He opens it up, sees daylight above, steps out and discovers where the prison is. It's an oil tanker -- a giant merchant ship floating in the middle of the ocean. Ray is speechless. He nervously ducks out of sight of a few oncoming guards, and after taking in his geography, he jumps back into the tube and slowly makes his way down into the ship. Along the way his foot slips, cracking open water pipes which begin to fill the tube and air ducts with water. Back in the isolation area, Hobbs has arrived to diagnose Rottmeyer's hysterical ramblings. Ray is having difficulty reaching his isolation cell. Much of his way back is under water. Back in the isolation area, the other prisoners watch as sea water floods their cells. The guards are overwhelmed by the panicked prisoners and begin releasing them from the boxes one-by-one. They come to Ray's box last, and Ray barely manages to make it back into his cell, take the bread from the camera, and close the access panel beneath him, before his door flies open and he's yanked out of the cell by the guards. The prisoners are returned to general population while Hobbs and Drake try to find the source of the flood. They come to Ray's cell and notice a single rusty screw sitting atop the access panel. Drake suggests that the flood must have dislodged it. Hobbs doesn't buy it. He orders Drake and his men to make Ray's life a living hell.Back in Los Angeles, Abigail storms into Lester's office, carrying the multi-million dollar check issued by the CIA -- it's been frozen. Lester doesn't seem concerned and tries to convince Abigail to let it go. She's so worked-up about Ray that she's becoming suspcious of everybody. She leaves Lester's office, but talks with Hush. Hush does some internet research and comes across the concept for a prison that is identical to the one that's holding Ray. The only problem is that the prison's location is unknown.Back in the mess hall, Ray delivers the bad news to Rottmayer: they're in the middle of the ocean, with no recognizable landmarks within viewing distance, aside from the stars. Ray believes, if he can get a hold of a few regular objects, he can MacGyver-together a sextant which they can use to determine their location. Ray hurriedly constructs the sextant, and passes it to Rottmeyer seconds before he's accosted by a trio of Hobb's guards. For the next several days, Ray can't sleep, eat, walk, or breath without the guards assaulting him. Ray and Rottmeyer determine that they'll never have an opportunity to get outside to use the sextant, but that someone else might. They go to Javed, who is still fuming from his recent stay in the box, but Rottmeyer convinces him to their cause by promising to break him out of the prison. They tell Javed to tell Hobbs that Ray is planning to escape, and that he'll continue to give Hobbs information on the escape in exchange for the opportunity to do his daily prayers outside, in the open air. Hobbs agrees and gives Javed his pass to the outside. Back in Hobb's office, he speaks on the phone to an unknown party who reveals that Portos is actually famed prison-escaper Ray Breslin. It's revealed to be Lester, who is speaking to Hobbs. Lester tells Hobbs that he can keep Ray in the prison for the rest of his life. Hobbs summons Ray to his office and reveals that he knows his true identity, and boasts that he designed his inescapable prison after reading Breslin's own published book about escaping prisons. Ray, who still needs the escape to go to plan, lies to and offers to work with Hobbs, to get information on Mannheim from Rottmayer. That night, Javed prays on the deck of the ship, and as the guard turns away, he hurriedly looks through the sextant at the stars and marks their location, in degrees, on Ray's map. The information is returned to Ray who, upon factoring in the location of the stars, proximity to land for supplies, and the weather and temperature of the ocean, suggests that they're somewhere off the coast of Morocco. Now that they know where they are, all they need is a message to the outside world, and for that they'll need to convince Dr. Kyrie to aid them. While standing in line, Rottmayer stabs Ray in the leg which prompts a visit to the infirmary. At the infirmary, Ray has his leg stitched up, without the aid of pain killers (another ruthless rule of Hobb's). Ray convinces Dr. Kyrie to remember the hypocratic oath he took as a doctor. Furthermore he tells Kyrie to go to Hobbs' office and to read a passage on a particular page in Breslin's book to confirm Ray's identity and story of innocence. Kyrie ultimately is convinced by Ray and agrees to send out one coded e-mail, to Rottmeyer's people, with his whereabouts.Back in general population, Ray, Rottmayer and Javed set in motion plans to distract the prisons' guards and allow them a window to escape to the surface. Ray and Rottmayer are a part of cellblock A, and Javed and the rest of the Muslims are a part of cellbock C. Their plan is to make the guards assume that a riot will occur in cellblock C, reducing their numbers in cellblock A where the riot will truly occur. The riot begins in cellblock A, and the understaffed guards are soon overwhelmed by the attacking inmates. Ray, Rottmayer and Javed take out multiple guards, steal their guns, and synchronize their watches. Rottmayer's people, who were alerted by Dr. Kyrie, are flying toward the ship in an attack helicopter. They'll be there in 11 minutes, and the three will have a brief window to escape. The trio makes their way up a service ladder and finally to the hatch just below the surface. Hobbs, who had been alerted to the riot in cellblock A, orders a full shutdown of the prison. With a click, blast doors close all over the prison, and the surface hatches are magnetically snapped shut. The trio reach the hatch seconds after it locks. They're trapped. The three descend the ladder and hide as time ticks away. Ray tells Rottmayer and Javed that he will go to the engine room in the bowels of the ships, where he should be able to restart the ship's electrical system, and cause the surface hatches to temporarily unlock. Hobbs' guards find the trio and open fire. Rottmayer and Ray shoot back, but Javed takes a bullet to the stomach and falls to the ground. Ray gives Javed his gun, tells Rottmayer to take care of him and runs to the engine room. Rottmayer looks at his watch, and Javed, who realizes that they're running out of time, asks for Rottmayer's gun and tells him to climb the ladder. Javed heroically takes out dozens of guards with the pistols, before being shot and killed by Hobbs' men.Ray arrives at the engine room, meets minimal resistance, and manually turns off the ship's cache of batteries. One by one, lights and electrical systems turn off in the prison and the surface hatch opens for Rottmayer. Rottmayer emerges from the hatch and hides as guards, on the bridge, open fire. Down below, in the engine room, Drake corners Ray and the two engage in a bloody fistfight. Ray manages to kick Drake down a flight of stairs, where he breaks his neck and dies in a puddle of blood. On the surface, Rottmayer's men in an attack chopper, have arrived and open fire on the bridge and its guards. They hurriedly land the chopper, and beg Rottmayer to jump in so they can take off, but he refuses -- they can't leave without Ray. Rottmayer mounts a machine gun and mows down waves and waves of guards. Hobbs arrives at the engine room, but Ray is nowhere to be seen. He's hidden himself inside of a water tank, half-filled with sea water. Hobbs orders his men to turn the ship's systems back on one-by-one. The water tank quickly fills with water, and within seconds Ray is submerged up to his hair in water. As Hobbs continues his search for Ray he doesn't realize that the water tank automatically flushes itself out when it reaches a certain volume. The water tank is emptied into the ocean, and Ray with it. Back on the surface, Rottmayer and the helicopter pilot take off, and circle the ship, trading gunfire with guards and looking for Ray. Ray surface, in the water, and Rottmayer orders his man to drop a rope ladder. Hobbs appears on deck and orders his men to open fire on the helicopter. A gunfight ensues between Rottmayer and Ray on one side and Hobbs and co. on the other. Rottmayer manages to toss Ray, who is dangling from a string, a pistol. Ray fires at a pallet full of explosive tanks seated directly beneath Hobbs. The tanks explode, taking Hobbs with them, allowing Ray and Rottmayer a window to escape to Morocco.The helicopter hovers over the Moroccan beach and the pair of Ray and Rottmayer jump out onto the sand. Ray, confused, asks where Mannheim's people are, and Rottmayer reveals the truth -- he is Mannheim. A pickup truck, with a pair of armed soldiers pulls up to meet them. The driver exits the truck and opens the back door, and out steps Mannheim's daughter, Jessica Miller -- the CIA agent who brought the job to Breslin and Clark in the first place. Mannheim/Rottmayer reveals that they knew if anyone could break out of Hobbs' prison, it was Ray Breslin, and they concocted this mission to get him out. Mannheim/Rottmayer climbs into the pickup with his daughter, asks Ray if they can give him a ride, which he refuses, and they drive off.Ray Breslin returns to Los Angeles, where he's met by Abigail. Abigail reveals what she and Hush discovered. Hobbs' illegal prison organization contacted Breslin & Clark so they could get infamous prison escaper out of the picture. They contacted Lester, and offered him a seven-figure salary with a job like Hobbs', in exchange for Ray. In fact, Lester has a business meeting, at that exact time, with the company in Miami. In Miami we watch as Lester Clark steps into a high rise elevator with a briefcase and exits to the parking garage. He climbs into his luxury sedan, and is about to drive off when Hush appears in the backseat, and knocks him out. Hours later, Lester awakens in his car, in a pitch black room. He attempts to open his doors, but they're pinned shut by the room's walls. The camera pulls-out revealing that Lester, and his car are trapped inside a storage container, stacked atop hundreds of others on a cargo ship similar to Hobbs'.Back in Los Angeles Ray and Abigail exchange flirtatious jokes and walk through an airport hangar to a waiting private jet."
Don Jon,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2229499/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A New Jersey guy dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love. Jon Martello objectifies everything in his life: his apartment, his car, his family, his church, and, of course, women. His buddies even call him Don Jon because of his ability to pull ""10s"" every weekend without fail. Yet even the finest flings don't compare to the transcendent bliss he achieves alone in front of the computer watching pornography. Dissatisfied, he embarks on a journey to find a more gratifying sex life, but ends up learning larger lessons of life and love through relationships with two very different women.—SophiaLB Jon Martello is a young Italian American and modern-day Don Juan living in New Jersey, with a short list of things he cares about: ""my body, my pad, my ride, my family, my church, my boys, my girls, my porn."" Though he has a very active sex life, he is more sexually satisfied by viewing pornography and masturbating, which he claims allows him to ""lose himself."" On a night out with his two best friends, Bobby and Danny, Jon sees Barbara Sugarman, a young Jewish woman from a more affluent background. Although she finds him interesting, she declines his offer for a one-night stand. He tracks her down on Facebook and invites her to lunch. There is mutual attraction, but Barbara insists on a long-term courtship, which proceeds for over a month without sex. She encourages Jon to take night classes to get an office job outside the service industry, and Jon indulges her love for romance movies, which he usually dismisses as unrealistic fantasy. They meet each other's families and Jon's parents love her.. Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young man nicknamed Don Jon by his friends for his ability to get any woman he wants into bed. He explains in a voice-over narration his method for masturbating. When he sits and looks at the computer, he starts looking at photos of women to get into the mood. He then searches for the perfect video clip and doesn't touch himself until he finds it. When he does, slowly but surely he gets lost in it until he climaxes.Jon goes on to explain his life mantra: ""There's only a few things I really care about in life. My body. My pad. My ride. My family. My church. My boys. My girls. My porn"", Jon says. Jon notes that last one probably seems strange to others but he his reasons for it.We see Jon go to a club and meet up with his best friends, Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke). They begin to scope out women and rate them on the 10 point scale. Jon dismisses a few of their choices when he sees the one. Jon looks to the bar and sees Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) who in his mind is a dime. Danny scoffs at his choice but Jon will not hear it. He goes in for the kill and says 'hello' to her.Cut to a montage of Jon dancing with Barbara and drinking with her. He tries to kiss her and put his hands all over her and she lets him to a degree but rebuffs him otherwise. She eventually gets in a cab without him and Jon cannot believe he failed with a woman. He goes back inside and finds another beautiful woman. The montage begins again though this time he is successful with bringing the girl home and sleeping with her. In bed later, he pulls away from her and turns on his computer in the living room and watches some porn.Jon admits he regularly sleeps with beautiful women and it is awesome but for some reason, they are not better than masturbating to pornography. He equates it to what the girls are willing to do in real life. Sure, they may look and feel like girls in porn but they wont do the same things. He notes it is not fun to give a girl oral sex and when on the off chance she is willing to give him oral sex, she is always in a hurry to get done. Sex is missionary position only since they want to see him during sex and Jon is unable to feel her body in that position. Finally, while condoms are a necessary evil, they don't feel good and he is unable to give a money shot to the girl and has to come inside a piece of plastic. With porn, he can experience everything he cannot feel with real women and real sexuality.Jon goes to church every Sunday with his family, mother Angela (Glenne Headly), father Jon Sr. (Tony Danza) and technology obsessed sister, Monica (Brie Larson). Every week, Jon confesses his sexual conquests and masturbation to his priest and is given prayer penances.Jon has dinner with his family. Monica buries herself in her phone and is silent. His father is obsessed with football and is otherwise loud and belligerent. Meanwhile, his mother tells Jon her greatest wish is that she is told by him that he has finally found the one.Jon narrates despite his love for porn there are a few downsides. For one, sometimes he is close to finishing with a good clip, when the camera shifts to the perspective of the male performer which disgusts him. Furthermore, there is just too much porn to choose from and he values his free time. Also, sometimes he finds a clip that is so perfect that he wonders why he can't find anything close to that.Jon, still having not given up on being with Barbara, asks around the bar he frequents for her name. Bobby looks her up on Facebook for Jon then tells him for this girl he may have to use the long game; going on a date or more to seal the deal. Jon is reluctant but decides to go for it.Jon meets Barbara for lunch. She notes he didn't get her name though he tries to say he did. Finally, he admits he asked about her. Jon asks why she said yes to his date; Barbara said she was intrigued but makes it clear that she will expect him to be honest with her about everything as she isn't like other girls. Jon tells her in all honesty, that she is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. ""You like movies?"" Barbara asks.Jon tells the audience he doesn't go to movies a lot anymore. Especially the ones Barbara would enjoy. While he'd rather watch a hardcore action film, she wants to see romantic dramas with generic titles such as Special Someone (with film within film cameos by Channing Tatum and Anne Hathaway). Jon says everyone knows those movies are full of crap, but people eat them up like they are reality. Barbara loves the movie, while Jon obviously lies about enjoying it. Still, he gets a passionate kiss from Barbara out of it.Jon cleans up his apartment. He goes to church and confesses to kissing Barbara, having no sex and masturbating a lot, getting his penance.Jon continues to date Barbara who manipulates him into bettering himself with the promise of sex. After one date, they kiss outside her apartment door and she wrangles him into meeting his friends, his family, and him going back to school. In return, she dry humps him to climax and then heads into her apartment leaving him flustered.Jon organizes a dinner for Barbara for their one month anniversary. In attendance are his friends and Barbara's friends. They go clubbing and Barbara tells her friends they haven't had sex yet, which makes her friends like him even more.Jon has dinner with his family and tells them about Barbara. His mother is ecstatic.At a family function with Barbara, Jon meets her mother and extended family. They make out in her room but Jon is denied sex once more.Jon starts to go to night school for Barbara. Going back in after a break, he gets a call from Barbara who wants to come over to his apartment after class which he is very happy about. About to go back in, he is confronted with a fellow classmate, Esther (Julianne Moore) who is crying in the doorway. Jon has to go by her and excuses himself.Barbara comes by to his place later and they have sex. Still, he pulls away from her and powers up his computer. Jon notes her body is perfect and the sex was decent and yet still, something was missing. As he is looking at porn, he realizes she is behind him. Barbara is horrified he is looking at porn. Jon is able to diffuse the situation by saying his buddy sent him the clip as a sick joke and he isn't a guy who looks at porn. Barbara makes him promise he wont look at porn anymore and he agrees.Jon tries to give up porn cold turkey. However, it is harder than he thinks it will be. In the end, Jon decides to never look at it when Barbara is around, which is difficult as she is staying at his apartment more. He eventually finds out he can watch porn on his cell phone and looks to take it everywhere.Jon goes to another night class. Esther sits by him and apologizes for crying in front of him. It is awkward to him and he tries to brush her off. She then admits she saw him looking at porn on his phone and he tells her she's crazy in his attempt to deny it.Jon takes Barbara to a dinner with his folks. His mother is happy that she is so nice, and his father can't believe he found a woman so beautiful. Monica just rolls her eyes through the whole dinner.However, his family is impressed that Jon has some stability in life with a relationship.Jon takes Barbara to church. He goes to confession and admits premarital sex but that he has stopped watching porn. His penance is less than usual so he believes he is going a positive direction.During a class break, Esther comes up to Jon and gives him a gift; a porn from the 70s which she admits isn't like the violent stuff he usually likes to watch. Jon is taken aback by the gift saying he doesn't watch that stuff any more since he has a girlfriend he loves. Still, he doesn't give it back.Jon and Barbara have a dinner date. While they talk about day to day stuff, porn clips flash through Jon's head. It is clear that he is slowly but surely relapsing.At a store to get some things for her apartment, Jon says he needs to get some cleaning products. Barbara is shocked he cleans his own place and tells him she'll contact her housekeeper to do his place. Jon tries to explain he likes cleaning his place but Barbara shoots him down.""Don't talk about vacuuming in front of me, come on!"" Barbara says""Why, what's wrong?"" Jon asks.""Why? Because it's not sexy, that's why!"" Barbara says. She tells him to never bring it up again and Jon agrees.At night class, Esther tracks down Jon and asks to copy his notes. As she does, she begins to give him the third degree about his relationship so he takes his notes back and leaves. Going home, he sees Barbara on the couch crying. She tells him she told him to never lie to her and he has. Barbara says she knows he is looking at porn again as he never cleans out his web history. Jon admits it, and tells her every guy looks at porn. He then turns the tables on her asking how she can watch all them romantic comedies, it's practically the same thing as he does.""Movies and porn are different, Jon. They give awards for movies"", Barbara yells.""And they give awards to porn too"", Jon replies.Barbara is disgusted with him and leaves him, telling him she thought he was different.Jon goes back to his routine, and says he is reminded why he enjoyed being single, as no one told him how to live his life. However it is clear that he is in a downward spiral. Going out one night, he knowingly steals a girl his friend Danny wanted right in front of him.On the way to church, Jon gets into a road rage incident and breaks a man's window with his fist. He gets to church, and lies to his mother about his hand.At another family dinner, Jon lies to his family about still dating Barbara.While trying to masturbate to porn, Jon's buddy Bobby comes over and asks about what is going on with him. Jon admits the reason Barbara broke up with him is because she caught him looking at porn. Bobby can't believe that was enough for Barbara to dump him. Bobby asks if he is going to finish the night class, as he had only been going to it for Barbara's sake.Jon still goes to the class. One night afterwards, he catches up with Esther and they have sex in her car. Esther lights up a joint and they talk about Jon's problems with sex. She correctly deduces that he relapsed with porn several times during his time with Barbara and that he is probably addicted to porn as he has never been without it for years and he cannot masturbate without it.Jon tries to jerk off without it but finds out he can't. Still he admits, Its not like I'm a junkie or anything. I can quit anytime.For the next class, Jon grabs Esther before she goes in and begins to kiss her. He suggests blowing the class off and she agrees, taking him back to her house. They sit on the couch and she asks if he watched the porn he gave her, which he admits he hasn't. Esther tells him that he's into porn because it is a one sided affair. To have real sex be better than porn, he has to be willing to let go with another person, to let it be a two sided street. Esther suggests they take a bath together. As she runs the water, she goes to get a towel for him. At the closet, she breaks down crying.Jon takes a bath alone and wraps up in a towel he finds in the bathroom. He finds her later and asks what is wrong and ponders if she is in a bad marriage or something. Esther says no. She then goes on to explain she lost her husband and son in a car accident 14 months ago and she is still grieving. Jon tells her he is sorry for her loss. Jon and Esther kiss which proceeds to them having sex, and probably for the first time, Jon has an emotional connection to the sex he has with her.The next morning, Jon drives in his car, singing Good Vibrations though not allowing anyone to see him sing.At another family dinner, Jon finally admits he and Barbara broke up. His father can't believe he let her slip away and his mother is devastated as she thought she would be getting grandchildren soon. Jon admits that perhaps he doesn't want a family yet. Suddenly, his sister Monica speaks. Jon's mother turns the always on television off so she can hear her. In her only lines of the film, Monica tells her parents that it was obvious to her that Barbara had an agenda of her own; she didn't care what Jon wanted or liked. She just wanted someone she could boss around. She tells Jon it is a good thing they are no longer together.Jon goes to the gym. Rather than working out alone, he changes his routine, shooting basketball with a group of guys.Later that night, Jon meets Bobby and Danny for pizza, the friends now on better terms. Danny reveals he got a girl's number but didn't get her name as he put her name under the contacts list as Ponytail. Bobby and Jon laugh at their friends misfortune.Jon meets with Barbara and apologizes for what happened with them. Barbara tells him she asked one thing of him and he failed. Jon says that actually she asked a lot of things from him and he couldn't meet her expectations. Barbara tells him goodbye and not to contact him again.Jon narrates that he is now in a better place now that he is with Esther. He had never been one for eye contact, but looking at her gets him excited now. He enjoys his time with her and isn't looking for more at the moment as he is still young and she is still grieving for the family she lost. However, now when he has sex with her, he can be lost in her, and she in him and for the first time in his life, he has a meaningful, content relationship with a woman."
The Incredible Burt Wonderstone,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790628/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A veteran Vegas magician tries to revive his career after his longtime partner quits, he gets fired from his casino act, and an edgy new ""street magician"" steals his thunder. Superstar magicians Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) have ruled the Las Vegas Strip for years, raking in millions with illusions as big as Burt's growing ego. But lately the duo's greatest deception is their public friendship, while secretly they've grown to loathe each other. Facing cutthroat competition from guerrilla street magician Steve Gray (Jim Carrey), whose cult following surges with each outrageous stunt, even their show is starting to look stale. But there's still a chance Burt and Anton can save the act - both onstage and off - if only Burt can get back in touch with what made him love magic in the first place.—stefanstojkov ""The Incredible Burt & Anton: A Magical Friendship!"", starring the ""Incredible Burt Wonderstone & Anton Marvelton"", is a successful headlining Vegas magic act, they who have a theater in which they perform at Bally's named after them. Burt and Anton have been unconditionally loyal friends for thirty years since they were ""Albert Wenzlestein"" and ""Anthony Mertz"", bullied, neglected and thus otherwise friendless preteens, the birthday present of a Rance Holloway Magic Kit to Albert which brought them together. Their friendship and professional partnership is threatened as Burt has become completely enamored with his own fame, believing that he is the sole reason for the show's success. He is now misogynistic, treating each of their female assistants as interchangeable puppets. Their latest assistant, Jane, who Burt continually calls Nicole (Jane's predecessor) and who has admired Burt since she first saw him perform ten years ago, is also an aspiring magician. But his insensitive attitude toward her has changed her mind about what was her dream of working as an actual magician alongside him. He also believes that what worked in their show ten years ago when they started headlining at Bally's should work now to draw in the crowds. The show is also threatened with the arrival into Vegas of Steve Gray, a street magician who is an Internet sensation with his over the top vulgar street shows, in contrast to the more staid tricks Burt and Anton perform which are meant to entertain through amazement and wonder rather than gross theatrics.

Baggage Claim,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1171222/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Pledging to keep herself from being the oldest and the only woman in her entire family never to wed, Montana embarks on a thirty-day, thirty-thousand-mile expedition to charm a potential suitor into becoming her fiancé. Determined to get engaged before her youngest sister's wedding, flight attendant Montana Moore (Paula Patton) finds herself with only 30 days to find Mr. Right. Using her airline connections to ""accidentally"" meet up with eligible ex-boyfriends and scour for potential candidates, she racks up more than 30,000 miles and countless comedic encounters, all the while searching for the perfect guy.—Fox Searchlight Pathologically single, 30-something, flight attendant, Montana Moore (Paula Patton) is on a mission to get her overbearing, frequently married, mother (Jenifer Lewis) to stop pressuring her to get married. After being jilted by her only prospect (Boris Kodjoe) just as her younger sister, Sheree (Lauren London), becomes engaged, Montana and her friends (Adam Brody and Jill Scott) devise a plan to help her find a potential husband before Sheree's wedding. Over the course of 30 days, Montana flies all over the country (with the help of a colorful team of coworkers) hoping to reconnect with a litany of ex-boyfriends that include a misogynistic politician (Taye Diggs), an irresponsible entertainer (Trey Songz) and a commitment shy multi-billionaire (Djimon Hounsou).. Thirty-something Montana Moore, a Baltimore based flight attendant with Trans-Alliance Airlines, has a number of close friends - her long time BFF, blue collar William Wright, who lives across the hall from her with his current girlfriend, Taylor, and Mo often on the same flight detail with her ""girl problem"" confidantes, Gail Best and gay Sam - but has long been the literal bridesmaid, nine times and counting, and not the bride. She is under pressure from her overbearing wedding planner mother, Catherine, frequently married herself, to find a husband, that pressure increased with the announcement that Mo's youngest sister, college sophomore Sheree Moore, the last in the family besides Mo, is getting married in one month's time. In placing that pressure on herself, Mo is determined to make the announcement of her own engagement by the time of Sheree's wedding. When Mo discovers that her current boyfriend, Graham, who she believed may have been the one, ends up not being so, Sam believes he has a way to help Mo. A large proportion of Mo's casual ex-boyfriends, like Graham, she met in they being high powered frequent flyers, so using a tight knit network of Trans-Alliance employees and airport workers, Sam and Gail are going to track the movement of said ex-boyfriends on the Trans-Alliance network to maneuver Mo in place, either as a flight attendant or fellow passenger, on those same flights, no matter where in the country. In Mo criss-crossing the country in ""unexpectedly"" reconnecting with ex-boyfriends, she discovers much about them that she didn't know the first time around. As the end of the one month nears, Mo may also discover much about herself and what may have always been right in front of her without she truly noticing.—Huggo Flight attendant Montana Moore (Paula Patton) says that her mother Catherine (Jenifer Lewis) has always been big on marriage. Not surprising, since it's shown that she's been married many, many times. Unfortunately for Montana, her relationships have never worked out. She is practical about the kind of man she wants (he must be faithful, not care about work more than her, not have an attitude, and financially secure), but she mostly doesn't want to be alone.Recently, Montana's met the man who might be ""the one"" - Graham Jackson (Boris Kodjoe). She finds out from her friend and neighbor William (Derek Luke) that Graham wrote her a letter inviting her to spend Thanksgiving with him in Chicago. She also tells her fellow flight attendant friends, the promiscuous Gail (Jill Scott) and her gay BFF Sam (Adam Brody), excitedly thinking that this might be the weekend where Graham proposes to her. Before Montana leaves, Sam gives her a necklace from his grandmother to find true love while Gail gives her cranberry-flavored condoms.Montana and Graham take a romantic boat ride to his place and later have sex. Instead of taking her back to his place, however, Graham leaves Montana at a hotel while he goes to prepare for a business meeting. Montana calls Gail to express her concern, which makes Gail suspicious that Graham is hiding another woman. Montana reluctantly (and clumsily) sneaks over to Graham's place and sees that he is indeed preparing for a business meeting, leading her to think that she has finally found the perfect guy to share her life with. That's when another woman enters into the room, and she is pregnant. Montana realizes that she was the mistress and she leaves sadly.William hears Montana playing the same sad song over and over, so he cheers her up by cooking her a meal. Later, Montana visits her mom and sister Sheree (Lauren London) to find out that Sheree has just gotten engaged. Montana thinks it's too soon as Sheree is still just a college sophomore, but she insists that her fiancee is just perfect. She asks Montana to be the bridesmaid at the wedding, which causes her more distress. She expresses to Gail and Sam how she doesn't want to show up to her sister's wedding alone, especially since her mom will nag her about staying single. Montana decides she must find a husband within 30 days or risk showing up to that wedding alone. Sam comes up with the plan of just ""coincidentally"" bumping into one of her exes by meeting them on one of their flights across the country to see which one is right for her, and since he's done favors for several people who work for the same airline as them, they owe him and can fix Montana's work schedule to coincide with the flights of these men. Gail is against the idea as she knows it is illegal, and because she knows her best friend doesn't need a man to define her.The first ex Sam checks on is Damon Diesel (Trey Songz), a rapper who is supposedly wealthy enough for Montana to go back to. Before she can make her decision, Catherine visits Montana to tell her that she has failed her daughter in finding her a man. Montana clearly doesn't wanna hear it and then goes back to Sam so he can give her Damon's flight time. She gets a ride to the airport from William, who is skeptical about her plans, but he wishes her luck.Montana ""bumps into"" Damon on his flight to Houston, and they seem to be hitting it off well. He takes her back to his place to get in the bathtub. Turns out the place really belongs to Damon's nutty co-worker Janine (Tia Mowry). It also turns out that Damon is broke and is mooching off of Janine. He tells Montana to leave through the fire escape as Janine breaks down the door and tries to attack Damon.Gail tells Montana that Bachelor #2 is going to D.C. and Montana has an hour to catch the flight. She meets an ex named Langston (Taye Diggs) as well as another ex named Curtis (Tyler Lepley). Montana gets off the plane with Langston, who says he's running for Congress. That evening, Langston takes Montana to meet with potential campaign contributors, the Donaldsons (Ned and Sandra Beatty). On their date, Langston takes control of what happens, including ordering Montana's drink for her even when she tries to order something else. Although he secures funding from Mr. Donaldson, the man starts making suggestively condescending remarks about Langston representing his ""people"", and it gets more awkward when Montana gets in on the jabbing. Donaldson later doubles his contribution because her Tiger Woods joke made him laugh. Langston tells Montana that if she is gonna stick with him, she needs to stay seen and not heard. It's also obvious that Langston loves his dog Juicy more than anyone. Montana angrily leaves and takes the outfit he gave her, then calls William to drive out to Georgetown to pick her up.William takes her back to his place to watch a movie and they have a drink while checking out their old high school yearbook. They dance to a song they listened to at their prom and then fool around for a bit before they kiss. However, this turns out to have just been a dream Montana had as she fell asleep on William's shoulder.Montana wakes up to find Catherine sitting next to her on the bed. Montana gets fed up with her mom's constant butting into her life, so she lies and says she's got a date to Sheree's rehearsal dinner. She takes William to get fitted for outfits for the dinner. It starts getting more obvious that there's a connection going on between them. Montana then gets a text from Sam telling her to get to the airport.With 16 days left, Montana keeps meeting up with other exes, but they only continue to disappoint her and she continues to grow more frustrated. On another flight, Montana sees William's girlfriend Taylor (Christina Milian) with another man. Taylor asks Montana not to not tell William about it since she claims they just broke up. She then asks Montana for some tea, which pisses her off.Montana calls William in the middle of the night to talk, but discovers that Taylor is there with him. She grabs the phone from William and hangs up on Montana. Montana then later gets drunk and sings karaoke at a bar, attracting the attention of an ex-boyfriend named Quentin (Djimon Hounsou). He treats her to a meal and reveals that he owns the hotel she's staying at. He makes it clear he's set on traveling and seeing the world instead of getting married, but he tells her that if she's looking for marriage, she should let it come to her. As a gift, he gives her a diamond bracelet, but she goes back home feeling defeated.William visits Montana to express his feelings about her whole plan, but she rudely tells him off and tells him about Taylor, but he just leaves upset with her.The night of the rehearsal dinner comes, and Catherine brags that Montana has an announcement to make. Before Montana says anything, Langston shows up to propose. Catherine jumps to answer before Montana can, but she rejects him before everybody. She tells everyone how she's been going around looking for somebody to marry so everybody can accept her as an equal, but she realizes she doesn't need marriage to define her, and she's come to find herself along the way. She also tells Sheree that if she really loves her man, she supports her, but if it's for any reason other than love, it would be a mistake. Sheree and her fiancé admit they rushed into the engagement because of her mother. They agree to wait until they graduate and get to know each other before marrying.Outside, Catherine apologizes to Montana for pressuring her and her sister into marriage because she didn't want them to end up like her with multiple husbands. She admits that Montana's father was her first and only true love until his death. Catherine tells her to never let go of her true love when she finds him. They hug.While having food with Gail and Sam, Quentin comes to visit Montana. Gail tries to push her to see him, but Montana tells him that she wants more than expensive gifts and adventures, and she won't settle for anything less. Quentin agrees with her and she gives him back the bracelet. Gail thinks she's crazy for letting him go and then spots a gift from William. Montana opens it to find a box of Cracker Jacks as a reminder of when he proposed to her as kids with a toy ring. Inside the box is also a plane ticket to France. The flight is at 11:45 PM that same evening.Montana and her friends rush to find a cab to get to the airport while William is there to get to France. Sam informs his airline buddies to stall William until Montana gets there. She runs to the gate too late and misses the flight but runs into William. He confesses his love for her and then proposes to her for real. She accepts and they kiss.As Gail and Sam leave the airport, Montana tries to set them up with the same man. They fight for him as the film ends."
The Way Way Back,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727388/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Shy 14-year-old Duncan goes on summer vacation with his mother, her overbearing boyfriend, and her boyfriend's daughter. Having a rough time fitting in, Duncan finds an unexpected friend in Owen, manager of the Water Wizz water park. Duncan (Liam James) is not a popular kid and it doesn't look like the summer is going to offer anything better for him. His mother's boyfriend has invited them to his beach house where Duncan is expected to improve his personality and physical appearance, and meet girls. But his would-be step-sister doesn't want anything to do with him and his shy demeanor makes it difficult for him to meet anybody new. When Duncan wanders into the Water Wizz, the local water park, he meets adult employees who are just having fun. Owen (Sam Rockwell) lets Duncan work with him and their new-found bond will help each other mature and find their place in life. Which for Duncan means standing up to his would-be step-father, having a conversation with the girl next door and being more comfortable with who he is.—napierslogs This summer, life is going to be a little better. Duncan is a 14-year-old boy who lacks confidence and friends. He is forced to go on a family vacation with his mother, mother's boyfriend, and his 17-year-old daughter. Being shy does not help him make friends, but he refuses to stay locked up inside all day long. Little did he know that sitting at a picnic table at a waterpark was going to change his entire outlook of his summer, but also his confidence. This is an absolute ""must see."" It will have you laughing and keep you completely engaged.—Gina P. Fourteen year old Duncan's young teenaged life is not going well, with his parents long having been divorced, he living with his caterer mother, Pam. He is generally withdrawn partly because of not having positive adult role models. Pam has been dating car salesman Trent for close to a year, he who Duncan doesn't much like as boorish and condescending, especially toward him. Rather than spend the time with his father - which he would rather be a permanent situation regardless in light of Trent - Duncan is forced to accompany Pam, Trent and Trent's cliquey teenaged daughter Steph on their regular summer-long vacation to Trent's beach-front house, where they will hang out with other summertime regulars of the area: divorced Betty, a loud woman, and her two children, equally cliquey teenaged Susanna, and nerdish preteen Peter who has a lazy eye; and married couple Kip and Joan. With no obvious people he wants to associate with among this bunch, Duncan, in exploring, finds his way to the Water Wizz water park. There, he befriends the park staff, primarily taken under the wing of the park's manager, Owen, a slacker with a happy-go-lucky attitude toward life. In addition to getting beyond first impressions to find others who are kindred souls in one way or another, Duncan, in his friendships at Water Wizz, has a chance to blossom this summer at least to face the challenges he has in his life head on, instead of cowering in the corner as he has done of late.—Huggo Sensing that he's drifting away from his mother Pam during a summer vacation with her, her domineering boyfriend Trent, and Trent's daughter Steph, 14-year-old Duncan (Liam James) gets a job at a water park, and gains some much-needed self confidence under the guidance of happy-go-lucky park employee Owen, who approaches life from a fresh new perspective.. The Way Way Back begins with four people in a car Trent (Steve Carell) driving, his girlfriend Pam (Toni Collette), a divorced Mom, sitting beside him. Trent's teenage daughter Steph (Zoe Levin) lies across the backseat listening to music; Pam's son Duncan (Liam James) sits in the rear-facing seat in the trunk of the car, known as the way way back, hence the title of the movie.While Pam sleeps, Trent asks Duncan how he rates himself on a scale from 1-10. After some badgering by Trent, Duncan hesitantly replies a 6. Trent tells him he's a 3, and that he needs to put himself out there more.They arrive at Trent's beach house, and see their neighbor, Betty (Allison Janney), who seems to be a little boozy and needy. She is divorced and has three children: an older son, who is seen later in the movie selling marijuana to some of the parents, a teenage daughter, Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), and a younger son (with a lazy eye) named Peter.They bring their things into the beach house with Betty following behind. Steph fetches her swimsuit to head to the beach. She comes downstairs, and Trent and Pam coerce Duncan to go down to the beach with her. Both kids don't want Duncan to go, but he goes to please his mother. He heads down to the beach, sitting a distance from Steph and her friends. Susanna is there with Steph, but she wants to read, while Steph and her whiney friends complain about things. Steph calls to her boyfriend Chad, complaining she wants to go in the water, and he doesn't seem to care. Steph takes off her clothes to get into her swimsuit. She sees Duncan just looking over to her, and she says, ""Stop staring perv."" Steph and her friends go into the water. They rudely tell Susanna to go in the water with them. Duncan then leaves.On the way back to the beach house, Duncan runs into Betty and Peter, and Betty begins telling Duncan that he and Peter need to have a playdate. Duncan says he needs to ask his mom and walks away. Duncan comes home and later, comes downstairs to find Trent's party-hearty friends Joan (Amanda Peet) and Kip (Rob Corddry) chatting with Trent and Pam. They all eat dinner together, and Duncan remains quiet and seems to be miserable. The next day, Duncan finds a small girls' bike in the garage, and takes a ride into the town.At the local pizzeria he sees Owen (Sam Rockwell) playing Pacman on an old machine. They talk for a bit until Owen has to leave because his lunch break is over.Duncan comes back to the beach house and finds that they are going on Joan and Kip's boat. Duncan is forced to wear a life jacket (the only one required to do so), and Betty and Susanna tag along. They come back and later, Duncan goes outside and talks to Susanna about how it sucks here. She turns to go back indoors, and Duncan says, ""It looks like it's going to be a hot summer"" and she says, ""I thought we were done here.""The next day, Duncan goes to the Water Wizz water park and sees Owen. Owen takes him around and takes him to get a rental bathing suit from Lewis (Jim Rash) and learns that Lewis doesn't like working there. They go up to the water slide and meet Roddy (Nat Faxon) who runs it. Owen calls him an artist because he makes girls hold and wait so he can look at their butts before they enter the water slides tube.Later, Duncan and Owen run into Caitlin (Maya Rudolph) and she asks Owen if he did his work. As Duncan leaves for the day on his bike, Owen drives up to him and offers him a ride home. They get going after Duncan's bike is put into the rear seat of the car, and he drops off Duncan at the beach house. Owen asks Duncan if he wants a job at the water park, and Duncan accepts. When she sees Owen depart, Duncan's mother, Pam, asks him who that was, and Duncan tells her he's his friend. She replies ""A friend with a license?""The next day, Duncan reports for work at the water park. In his first scene at the water park, they see a group of people have taken cardboard and are break dancing on it. He is instructed by Owen to go over and to stop them. He turns off their music and attempts to pick up their cardboard. The guy dancing says that he can only take the cardboard if he shows them his moves. Duncan doesn't have any, but he tries some dance moves anyway. One girl from the crowd of onlookers shows up and teaches him some moves. They then flip him over and he spins on his head. He takes the cardboard, smiling brightly until he trips. Duncan is shown in a series of scenes, dancing with increasing levels of confidence. He then does what Roddy does at the top of the water slide, having the girls hold and wait so he can check them out.Duncan meets three boys who have been trying to pass each other on the water slide forever. No one has done this before. The three boys rush into the water slides tube at once and end up getting stuck and need someone to push them down.One rainy day he doesn't go to work. He stays at home and they all play the board game Candyland and end up getting into a huge fight over how strictly to apply the rules.The next day Duncan finds Owen setting up the chairs, and Duncan continues to work on his tasks. On the fourth of July, Betty hosts a clambake at the beach. At the clambake, Duncan observes Trent making out with Joan in the shadows next to the house.He returns to the table. We see Betty's oldest son passing out weed to the adults. Duncan walks on the beach with Susanna. They talk and watch the fireworks.Next day Susanna sees Duncan leave on the bike on his way to work, and she follows him to the water park. She is surprised that he works at the water park, Duncan having kept it a secret. When they meet up, he shows her around the water park. While talking to her, they are eyed by Owen and Roddy, who call Duncan over using the loudspeaker. They ask Duncan who the young woman is and why he doesn't ""seal the deal"" with her.He returns to Susanna, and Owen announces over the loud speaker ""Duncan please return to your lady friend and let her know this conversation was entirely about her.""That night, Duncan arrives back at the beach house and he notices that Trent's car isn't there. Pam, Steph and Duncan wait for a while and then eat dinner without him. Trent returns later that night and says he was stuck on the boat with Kip.The next day there is a party at a neighbor's house. Steph, Duncan and Susanna eat with the adults. Trent and Joan go out to dance. Pam overhears Kip telling Betty that the boat hasn't been working for a week, and needs help to fix it. Pam realizes that Trent's excuse was a lie, so she gets upset and walks away.Duncan gets up from the table and says, ""He's sleeping with her! And you know it!"" They get into an argument, and it gets a little physical.Later that night, Duncan sees Trent and Pam arguing. He goes down to the beach with Susanna. They talk about ghost crabs. He tries to kiss Susanna, but she leans back. Duncan is embarrassed and runs away from the beach.He sees Peter, who demands that Duncan take him wherever he's going. They go to a going away party for Lewis at the water park. As Lewis starts to make a speech, Roddy, Caitlin and Duncan surprise him by spraying him with water from water guns. A general water gun fight ensues.Duncan and Owen talk the next morning about Trent, and Duncan tells Owen about the time that he called him a 3. The next morning when Duncan arrives back at the beach house, he sees his mom packing, and he infers that he and his mother are leaving. But he is told they are all leaving together, which upsets him.As they are packing the car, Susanna comes over to say goodbye and kisses Duncan, and tells him that she was just taken by surprise the night before. Duncan sees Steph looking on, and says ""Stop staring, perv.""They get into the same seats in the car as at the beginning of the movie. They drive away and pass the water park. The song ""Power Hungry Animals"" plays. They stop at a gas station and Duncan hops out of the car and runs towards the water park. Pam and the others chase after him.Inside the water park Pam sees a noticeboard with a sign that says ""Employee of the Month"" and the photo is of Duncan. Duncan tells Owen he is going to pass him on the water slide. The two rush up the stairs to water slide, dive inside the tube, and Duncan comes out before Owen does. Duncan becomes the first person to ever pass someone on the water slide.We see that, despite his big plans for the future, Lewis is still working there.Owen talks to Pam and Trent. He tells Pam that she's got a hell of a kid in Duncan. Owen says Hi to Trent, saying, ""I'm a good friend of 'the 3'"". Duncan tells Pam he needs a minute with Owen before they leave, and Duncan and Owen say an emotional goodbye. They then all get into Trent's station wagon again.On the road all four passengers sit in silence, absorbed in their thoughts. After a few minutes Pam climbs over the seats and gets into the back with Duncan. They smile at each other. The movie closes."

To help her escape from the troubles of the war, she steals books and learns new words, while forming a close bond with a Jewish fugitive who she and her adoptive parents help hide.—RECB3 In April 1938, the movie opens with a voice (representing the Angel of Death) telling about how the young Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse) has piqued his interest. Liesel is traveling on a train with mother and younger brother when her brother dies. At his burial she picks up a book that has been dropped by his graveside. Liesel is then delivered to foster parents Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson) Hubermann, because her mother, a Communist, is in danger. When she arrives, Liesel makes an impression on a neighbor boy, Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch).Rudy accompanies her on her first day of school. When the teacher asks Liesel to write her name on the chalkboard, she is only able to write three 'X's, showing that she doesn't know how to read. Later that day, she is taunted by her schoolmates who chant ""dummkopf"". One of the boys, Franz Deutscher, challenges her to read just one word to which Liesel responds by beating him up. She impresses Rudy and they become fast friends. When Hans, her stepfather, realizes that Liesel cannot read, he begins to teach her, using the book that she took from the graveside. Liesel becomes obsessed with reading anything she can get her hands on.World War II breaks out and Liesel and Rudy become members of the Hitler Youth movement. While at a Nazi book burning ceremony, Liesel and Rudy are bullied into throwing books onto the bonfire by Franz, but Liesel is upset at all the books being burned. When the bonfire ends and everyone but she has left, she grabs a book that has not been burned. She is seen by Ilsa Hermann, the mayor's wife. Hans discovers that she has taken the book and tells her she must keep it a secret from everyone. One day, Rosa, her stepmother asks Liesel to take the laundry to the mayor's house. Liesel realizes that the woman who saw her taking the book is the mayor's wife and she is scared she will be found out. Instead, Ilsa takes her into their library and tells Liesel she can come by anytime and read as much as she'd like. One day Liesel is found reading by the mayor who not only puts a stop to her visits but dismisses Rosa as their laundress. Liesel continues to ""borrow"" books from the mayor's library by climbing through a window.There is a night of violence against the Hebrews (known historically as Kristallnacht). Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer) and his mother, who are Hebrew, are told by a friend that one of them (but only one) can escape and Max's mother forces him to go. Max goes to the Hubermann's house where Rosa and Hans give him shelter. Max is the son of the man who saved Hans' life in World War I. Max is initially allowed to stay in Liesel's room while recovering from his trip and they begin to become friends over their mutual hatred of Hitler, as Liesel blames Hitler for taking her mother away. Max is later moved to the basement so he can move around more, but it is colder in the basement and Max becomes dangerously ill. Liesel helps Max recover by reading to him with every spare moment.One day while borrowing a book from the mayor's home, Liesel is followed by Rudy. He discovers the secret of the books, and also the secret of Max whose name he reads on a journal that Max gave to Liesel for Christmas. Rudy guesses that her family is hiding someone and he swears to never tell anyone. Franz overhears them and confronts them about their secret. Rudy is forced to throw the journal into the river to keep it away from Franz. After Franz has gone, Rudy plunges into the icy river to rescue the journal and Liesel realizes that she can truly trust him. Soon a local party member comes by to check the Hubermann's basement and they have to hide Max. However, they are told that their basement was being checked as a potential bomb shelter and realize they weren't suspected of harboring a fugitive.While working one day, Hans sees a neighbor and friend being taken away by the police because they say he is really a Hebrew. Hans tries to tell the police that the man is a good German but his name is taken by them and he realizes what a mistake he has made, as this has made them visible. He tells the family and Max realizes he must leave in order to protect them. Hans then receives a telegram that he has been conscripted into the army and must leave immediately.On the way home from school one day, Liesel believes she has seen Max in a line of Hebrews being led on their way to a death camp, being marched through their town, and she begins screaming his name, walking through the line. She is thrown off the street twice by a German soldier and finally relents when Rosa picks her up and takes her home. Within a few days, Hans returns from the front because he was injured in a bomb that hit his unit's truck. The family is reunited only for a short time though as one night the city is bombed and no air raid siren alerts the citizens. Hans, Rosa and Rudy's family, excluding his father who has joined the Army, have been killed in the blast. Liesel was spared from the bombing by falling asleep in the basement while writing in the journal given to her by Max. Rudy is brought out of his house by neighbors and he is barely alive. He begins to tell Liesel that he loves her but he dies before he can finish the sentence. Liesel begs him to not die, telling him that she will give him that kiss he has been asking for and actually kisses him, but he has already died. During this scene, the Angel of Death is heard speaking again about how he received the souls of the dead.Two years later, Liesel is seen working in a tailor shop of Rudy's father, who has returned safely from the war. She looks up to see Max enter and she runs to hug him. The final scene is the Angel of Death speaking again about Liesel's life and her death at the age of 90, mentioning her husband, children and grandchildren, as we look over her apartment with pictures in her past and a portrait of her which continues to zoom in; it is not stated whom did she marry. The Angel of Death says that he has seen many good and bad things over the years, but Liesel is one of the few that ever made him wonder how it would be to live life. But in the end, there were no words, only peace. Lastly, Death says that the only truth it knows is true is that he ""is haunted by humans."""

Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) has just moved to the small southern town of Gatlin, where the only person who seems to understand her--or dream of bigger places or ideas--is a cute guy named Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), who recognizes her instantly from the cryptic dreams he's been having every night. Lena has come to stay with her mysterious uncle, Macon Ravenwood (Jeremy Irons), the patriarch of her powerful family: the Ravenwood clan are Casters, born with powers that ordinary mortals don't have, like the ability to move objects, control the elements, and even step out of normal space and time to communicate only with each other. But just as Lena feels ready to open up to Ethan, she discovers that their love is in imminent danger, because when female Casters turn 16, their destiny as either good or evil is revealed. Unwilling to let her nature be dictated by forces outside of her control, Lena and Ethan set out together to uncover the strange, secret lore of their families' intertwined histories dating back to the Civil War, and figure out how to grant Lena the power to choose her own destiny. Ethan Wate was born, raised and still lives in what he considers the backwater of Gatlin, South Carolina, where residents, as his mother, writer Lila Evans, used to say are too stupid to leave or too stuck to move. It is located next to an old Civil War battle site, Honey Hill, an annual reenactment of the battle which is organized by the Civil War Society at Christmas. He does expect to leave when he goes to college, those to which he is applying being as far away from Gatlin as possible. He is still mourning Lila's recent death in a car accident in the spring, Amma, a family friend and the town public librarian, acting as his caregiver in a promise to Lila. Many of who are considered the leading families of the town hide behind the church for their narrow-minded views, those families including that of Emily Asher, who Ethan dated up until the end of the last school year. They started growing apart as one of the things Ethan has started doing is reading books banned by the local church. In what is the start of his junior year, he has a new classmate in Lena Duchannes, shunned by Emily and her like in Lena being the niece of reclusive Macon Ravenwood, who the Christian fundamentalists in town believe is a Satanist. That feeling is despite the Ravenwoods having founded Gatlin. Ethan, however, is drawn to Lena, he believing she the girl in the recurring dream he has been having, they which started even before he and Lena met. Some close to Ethan know the secrets of the Ravenwoods, and that Ethan and Lena's meeting was destined as shown by his dreams. As Ethan begins to learn those secrets first hand in trying to get to know and falling for Lena, he may be tied to Lena's fate, for good or bad, the big day being Lena's sixteenth birthday on December 21st. Regardless of that fate, what happens with Lena and by association Ethan, which includes not only his ability to get out of Gatlin as he wants but his life or death, is affected by the arrival of two Ravenwoods that were explicitly not invited, namely Ridley Duchannes, one of Lena's cousins who recently went through the same thing on her sixteenth birthday, and Macon's sister Sarafine.—Huggo In Gatlin, South Carolina, Ethan Wate awakens from a recurring dream of a girl he does not know. In voice-over narration, he describes his enjoyment of reading banned books, his despair of his small-town existence, and his dreams of leaving for college. Arriving for his first day of junior year, Ethan notices newcomer Lena Duchannes, who resembles the girl he has been dreaming about. The other students do not take kindly to her and spread gossip regarding Lena's reclusive uncle, Macon Ravenwood, and suggest that her family includes devil worshippers. Overhearing these whispers, Lena tenses and the classroom windows shatter, amplifying the fears and suspicions of the class and the townspeople at large that she is a witch.On a drive home, Ethan nearly runs over Lena, whose car has broken down. He gives her a ride home and the two bond over their shared love of poetry and having both lost their mothers. Ethan drops Lena off but later finds a locket and returns to the mansion to give it to her as a present. The touch of a locket triggers a shared flashback to the American Civil War, after which Ethan awakens at his home. Macon disapproves of their growing romance and conspires with Ethan's family friend, Amma, to keep the two separated. However, Ethan continues to pursue Lena until she confesses that she and her family are ""casters,"" who are capable of performing a variety of magical spells such as changing the weather and casting illusions. On her 16th birthday, Lena's true nature will steer her towards either the light or the dark; Lena fears the latter, as it entails being consumed by evil and hurting those she loves. Ethan insists she is responsible for her own choices and reassures her that she is a good person.Matters are complicated by the arrival of two immensely powerful dark casters who aim to push Lena to the dark: Ridley, Lena's provocative cousin/childhood friend, and Sarafine, Lena's mother, who has possessed Mrs. Lincoln, the mother of Ethan's friend Link. Sarafine foresees that Lena will become an even more powerful caster and intends for Lena to use her newfound power to purge the Earth of humans, leaving Casters to rule in their wake. Lena and Ethan use the locket to re-experience the whole flashback, which reveals their ancestors, caster Genevieve Duchannes and mortal Confederate soldier Ethan Carter Wate were in love. Ethan Carter was shot in battle and Genevieve revived him using a forbidden spell that caused her to go dark and curse all the Duchannes family's women. They consult with Amma, who is in a seer/keeper of a caster library beneath the town library. The most ancient of these books, the Book of Moons, reveals the secret to undoing the curse: one of Lena's loved ones has to die. Unwilling to take Ethan's life, Lena instead erases his memories of their time together.Ridley seduces Link and gives him a bullet to use in an upcoming Civil War reenactment of the Battle of Honey Hill which will take place on Lena's birthday. During the reenactment, Link and Ethan agree to ""kill"" each-other so they can ditch the reenactment. While at the ceremony for her 16th birthday, Lena feels the shock of the curse being broken and runs off to Ethan, clutching his dying body as Ridley and Sarafine encourage her to surrender to grief and accept the dark. Lena lashes out in anger, sending lightning strikes through the crowd of reenactors until Ethan transforms into Macon, who had previously disguised himself as Ethan to become the needed sacrifice. His dying words encourage Lena to ""claim yourself""; she then causes the moon to disappear so it cannot claim her for the dark. Lena allows Ridley to flee and pulls Sarafine from Mrs. Lincoln's body, using her power to seal Sarafine's spirit away.Months later, a still-amnesiac Ethan stops by the library to visit Amma before leaving for a college campus tour with Link. He apologizes to Lena for not having got to know her during their time in Gatlin. Lena is then seen in the caster library, where it is revealed that she has claimed herself as a half dark/light caster. Meanwhile, just after Link drives past the town line, Ethan recalls their memories together. He gets out of the car to call Lena's name. Lena hears and the movie ends."

""NEBRASKA"" is a father-and-son road trip, from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska that gets waylaid at a small town in central Nebraska, where the father grew up and has scores to settle. Told with deadpan humor and a unique visual style, it's ultimately the story of a son trying to get through to a father he doesn't understand.—Anonymous The Grants - father Woody, mother Kate, and adult sons Ross and David - live in Billings, Montana. Aged Woody is approaching dementia, although the family likes to think that he solely believes what appears on the surface, Woody's delusions which are exacerbated by a lifetime of heavy drinking. The latest belief that Woody has is that he has won $1 million, which everyone in his family knows is one of those scams for people to purchase magazine subscriptions. As such, Woody, who does not trust the US postal service to mail in his ""winning"" certificate, is determined to walk to Lincoln, Nebraska, the headquarters of the company, to pick up his $1 million. All he really wants with the money is to buy a new pickup truck - something he's never had and despite the fact that he should no longer be driving - buy an air compressor to replace the one stolen from him decades earlier, and to leave a little legacy to Ross and David. Younger son David, an electronics salesman who has just broken up with his girlfriend and thus needs a distraction, agrees to drive Woody to Lincoln just to humor him, but not before making a stop in Hawthorne, Nebraska - Woody and Kate's hometown - for a family reunion, which will include news anchor Ross and acerbic tongued Catholic Kate in a few days. David does not want Woody to tell anyone in Hawthorne of the ""$1 million,"" but news of such does get out. This news colors Woody and David's interactions with their relatives and old friends and colleagues, including with Woody's old business partner, Ed Pegram. But this time in Hawthorne is also an illuminating one for David, who learns much about Woody and why he is the way he has always been, and about his parent's relationship as it concerns himself and Ross.—Huggo The first time we meet taciturn Woody Grant (Dern), he's walking down the shoulder of a busy road in Billings, MT -- so determined to reach his unknown destination that he fails to acknowledge the kindly police officer who's struggling to get his attention. When Woody's dutiful son David (Forte) arrives at the local police station to pick him up shortly thereafter, we learn exactly why the old man was so singularly focused on his stride: Having recently received a sweepstakes letter stating that he has won one million dollars, Woody is determined to claim his prize in person at the company's head office in Nebraska. Although David discerns right away that the letter is little more than a scam to sell magazine subscriptions, stubborn Woody already has tunnel vision -- nothing will stop him from obtaining his jackpot, even if he has to walk 800 miles on his own two feet to do so. Of course, this doesn't sit well with Woody's outspoken wife Kate (June Squibb) or career-driven son Ross (Bob Odenkirk), but David is determined to humor his befuddled father nonetheless, eventually agreeing to drive him to the sweepstakes office personally despite having to call in sick to work to get the time off. Shortly after the two set out, however, the road trip threatens to get sidetracked when longtime alcoholic Woody winds up in the hospital following a drunken fall. Pushing their schedule back to make time for his recovery, the pair plan to take a detour to David's Aunt Peg's house in his father's hometown of Hawthorne, where Kate and Ross will soon arrive for an impromptu family reunion. When Woody runs into his old pal Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) at a local tavern and shoots his mouth off about his recent ""windfall,"" he becomes something of a local celebrity, and familiar faces come out of the woodwork to claim their fair share of the prize. Meanwhile, David learns more about his family during this one eventful weekend than he did during his entire childhood, prompting some deeply personal reflection that offers him a whole new perspective on the father who was always something of a mystery.. An old man (Bruce Dern) walks along the snowy roads of Billings, Montana. A police officer stops him. The man seems aimless.David (Will Forte) picks up the old man, his father Woody, at the police station. Woody explains that he was walking to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect a million dollars he won in a mail order sweepstakes. David explains that these sweepstakes are scams, but Woody says this one must be genuine.When they arrive at Woody's house, his wife Kate (June Squibb) scolds him for believing in the contest.David, who sells stereo equipment at a local retail store, later comes back to his parents' house because his mother and older brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) are distressed that Woody has again wondered off on a long walk. Ross tries to convince David that Woody needs to be put in a nursing home, and David thinks he just needs more family support.David's ex-girlfriend Noel (Missy Doty) stops by his apartment to drop off a few things. He asks her to move back in, but she is frustrated by his lack of direction in their relationship.

The plan ends up taking a horrible twist and he must protect himself and his bride-to-be as the truth of the drug business is uncovered and targets are eliminated.—DJDC The Counselor decides to get involved with one of his clients who happens to be be a lucrative drug smuggler and decides that a ""one time"" drug smuggle couldn't hurt his financial pockets more than they already are. Needing to wait only a few days to come up with the money to get involved with this endeavor, the plot unfolds, and unbeknownst to Reiner (Bardem) or the Counselor (Fassbender), Malkina intends to ""double cross"" them BOTH.—Cindi Desperately in need of cash to pay off his rapidly-increasing debt, the Counselor--a suave and prominent lawyer--decides to enter the obscure world of drug trafficking, in an ill-advised, one-off deal that would make him rich enough to support a lavish lifestyle and his bride-to-be Laura. Driven by greed, the successful advocate is bent on putting to good use his connections to the criminal underworld--nightclub owner Reiner and seedy middleman Westray--ignoring the fact that theirs is a violent, destructive, and unforgiving world. Unwisely, the Counselor thinks that he knows all the angles to succeed. What happens if the deal goes wrong?—Nick Riganas 'The Counselor,' from a script by Cormac McCarthy, stars Michael Fassbender as the title character, a slick lawyer who is madly in love with Laura (Penelope Cruz). He asks her to marry him, and she agrees, though she is unaware that serious financial troubles have prompted him to fund a drug deal with a shady but established middleman named Westray (Brad Pitt), that could bring in millions. Part of the counselor's financial troubles stem from the fact that he's investing in a club being opened by his best friend Reiner (Javier Bardem), a hedonistic occasional client who has attained his wealth by any means necessary, and likes to keep his wife Malkina (Cameron Diaz) covered in all the accoutrements the wealthy enjoy. However, when the drug deal goes wrong, the Counselor is unprepared to deal with the fallout, and soon he's trying to protect his bride-to-be as well as himself from the wrath of a drug cartel that has no qualms about exacting revenge.. The movie begins with Counselor (Michael Fassbender) and his girlfriend Laura (Penélope Cruz) in bed engaging in sexual activity and then switches back and forth to another scene where Mexicans are concealing cocaine in a sewerage truck.Counselor then goes to Amsterdam for ""business"", but he is really going there to buy Laura a diamond ring because he intends proposing to her.Later, Counselor meets with Reiner (Javier Bardem) who influences the Counselor to get involved in drug trafficking to make a substantial amount of money. Counselor agrees with Reiner and a meeting is organised with Westray (Brad Pitt), a business associate of Reiner, to get the ball rolling.Westray explains to the Counselor the severe consequences that could ensue as a result of getting into bed with the Mexican cartel. However, Counselor is keen to continue on with the drug deal.The Counselor then visits Ruth (Rosie Perez), a client in prison, at her request. At the meeting, Ruth notifies the Counselor of her son (Richard Cabral) who has been imprisoned for speeding on his motorbike. Ruth also outlines to the Counselor that Richard was caught with $12,000, but she does not know where the money came from and what further charges were laid against Richard. Counselor assures Ruth that he will get Richard out of prison as a favour for her.However, little does Counselor know that Richard possesses an engine component, held inside his bike helmet, which operates the sewerage truck holding the cocaine.In the next scene, Reiner and Counselor have a lengthy conversation regarding Reiner's girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz). Reiner explains to Counselor that although he loves Malkina, he is also afraid of her because of her unpredictable and questionable behaviour.Unsurprisingly to the viewer, we see Malkina chatting with ""the Wireman"" (Sam Spruell) whereby her intentions are revealed - to follow Richard (who holds the component to the truck containing the cocaine) and obtain the component.In a brutal killing scene, Wireman beheads Richard and obtains the component and the truck containing the cocaine. Later on, Wireman is stopped by some men in a police car, however, Wireman is cautious and suspects the 'police' to really be the Mexican drug cartel wanting their cocaine back. Wireman's suspicions lead his partner to initiate a shootout: one member of the cartel is killed and his partner manages to kill both Wireman and his partner thereby re-securing the drugs stolen from the cartel.Nevertheless, the cartel is out for blood because somebody stole their cocaine. Unfortunately for the Counselor, all clues lead to him given that he was the lawyer who 'represented' and got Richard out of jail. The Westray opines that the cartel view this as no coincidence and that Counselor had a part to play in the attempted robbery of the cartel's cocaine.Subsequently, the cartel initiates a mental breakdown of the Counselor and kidnap his girlfriend Laura. Meanwhile, Reiner is killed in a gunfight with the cartel because his girlfriend, Malkina, who was really the person behind the attempted robbery of the cocaine, is short of money.Malkina decides to escape the cartel and go after Westray, who, after discovering the messy situation, fled to London. Malkina tracks down Westray and hires an American girl to seduce him and acquire his computer password, bank account details etc which she does successfully.Malkina hires more men to kill Westray using a self-tightening 'suicide collar' and acquire his computer in one of the most brutal killings in a movie. Malkina then expresses to her banker her intentions to move to Hong Kong.As for Counselor, he contacts a man by the name of ""Jefe"" (Rubén Blades), a high ranking cartel member, to try and track down Laura. However, Jefe refuses, and merely explains to the Counselor that his fate was sealed as soon as he made the decision to initiate the drug trafficking and implies to Counselor that instead of trying to fix his mistakes, he should rather accept his fate.Counselor has a breakdown and in the next scene we see the Counselor take delivery of a DVD with the word ""Hola!"" which implies it is a ""snuff film"" of his girlfriend Laura being brutally murdered by the cartel."

Regardless of what happens on the musical side of the collaboration, Gretta and Dan may provide that much needed external point of view for the other to get their respective lives back on track in a comprehensive manner.—Huggo Songwriting duo, Gretta, and her long-time musician boyfriend, Dave, had been dating since college when they decided to seek their fortune in bustling New York City. However, when Dave is signed by a major record label, temptation proves too powerful for him to resist, and the couple calls it quits. Crestfallen, Gretta fights to get back on her feet until one night, while performing in the East Village, she catches the eye of Dan, a famous and once-respected music executive who has since fallen on hard times. Enchanted by Gretta's powerful voice and skilful songwriting, Dan, who hasn't produced anything in the last seven years and has lost everything, convinces her to join him in a collaboration that will transform them both over the course of one unforgettable summer. What will it take to begin again, and revive a career?—Nick Riganas Dan Mulligan (Mark Ruffalo) is a formerly successful record label executive living in New York City who is estranged from his wife Miriam and struggling to keep up with the changing music industry.

Gretta is a young and fiercely independent songwriter from England who has just broken up with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl (Adam Levine), a newly successful musician who had an affair with one of his producers' assistants. Captivated by Gretta's music, Dan offers her to sign her to his former record label, and although she initially refuses she reconsiders the offer and agrees.Dan and Gretta meet with Saul, Dan's business partner and co-founder of their record label, but he does not see the same potential in Gretta and turns her away. Undeterred, Dan proposes that he and Gretta produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Gretta's best friend Steve, Dan sets out to make an album worthy of being published by his label. During this time, Dan and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and Gretta takes Dan's teenage daughter Violet, a fledgling guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album. When the album is finished, Dan and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is very impressed with their collaboration. Gretta demands that Saul give Dan his job back and give her a bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but Dan feels confident that Saul will eventually sign Gretta to the label.When Gretta sees Dave accepting an award on television, she criticizes him for selling out to the music industry and she expresses her grievances with him in a song which she records on his voice mail. A remorseful Dave, who is back in New York to promote his new album, returns her call and asks to see her. After some consideration, she decides to meet with him and they critique each other's albums. Gretta feels betrayed by Dave's heavily commercialized rendition of ""Lost Stars,"" a love ballad she had once written and composed for him as a Christmas present, believing that the true meaning of the song has been lost. Dave tells her that the audiences love when he plays it in the new way, and that their energy fills the room. He believes that music is about sharing it with people, but Gretta tells him that's not what she intended for that song. Nevertheless, Dave invites her to come and hear him play the song at the Gramercy Theatre that weekend so that she can see the impact it has had on his fans. She arrives at the venue just in time to watch him play her original arrangement of the song, but as she watches him play and sees the reaction of the crowd to the song and how Dave responds to the fans' adoration by slipping into singing the commercialized arrangement of the song, she realizes that he is a lost cause. Gretta then leaves the concert and cycles through the city with newfound closure and a dawning smile on her face.Afterwards, Gretta visits Dan at his apartment as he prepares to move back home, having made amends with his wife. She tells him that she does not want him to release her album, instead preferring to distribute it online for $1. Although Dan returns to work with Saul, he agrees to let Gretta release the album online and helps her to promote the release. The next day, Saul jokingly fires Dan for promoting Gretta's album and informs him that it sold 10,000 copies in its first day of release."

However, is Tim's extraordinary ability to fix the past the key to happiness?—Nick Riganas Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) starts to describe himself and his family. He was always ""too tall, too thin, and too orange."" His mother (Lindsay Duncan) was usually unsentimental. His father James (Bill Nighy) was a former university professor who now enjoys his free time reading and playing table tennis,. His uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery) was a bit odd and presumably has Alzheimer's, and his sister Katherine, nicknamed Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson), was free-spirited. The family has spent many joyful occasions together on the beach and at home in Cornwall, England, as Tim recalls.Tim's parents host a New Year's Eve party, which Tim is none too fond of attending. He and his friend Jay (Will Merrick) clumsily stumble into a table which spills drinks and bottles everywhere, even onto some guests. Kit Kat hooks up with a guy named Jimmy Kincade (Tom Hughes), while a pretty young blonde woman show interest in Tim. When everybody counts down to midnight, the woman leans in to kiss Tim, but he instead shakes her hand and wishes her a happy new year. The woman is visibly disappointed while everybody else is kissing their significant others.The next morning, Tim meets with his father in the family's den. James informs him of a big family secret that his own father shared with him when he turned 21. Apparently, the men in the family have the ability to travel through time. Tim is dumbfounded and doubts what his father just told him, but he asks how this task is accomplished. James tells him to go into a dark place, close his eyes, clench his fists tight, and think of the exact moment he wants to go to, and he will find himself there. Of course, he adds, there are limits to his time traveling, as he can only go to moments in his own life, as he cannot ""kill Hitler or shag Helen of Troy.""Tim goes into the wardrobe in his bedroom to make this attempt. He does what James told him, and he suddenly hears the Killers song ""Mr. Brightside"" playing loudly and he is stunned to see he is wearing the same outfit he wore at the New Year's Eve party. He avoids bumping into the table and when the countdown to midnight happens, he grabs the blonde woman and kisses her, much to her satisfaction. Tim returns to the present to express his astonishment to his father. He asks Tim what he plans on using this ability for and he answers that he'd really like to use it to get a girlfriend.Summertime rolls around and Kit Kat's friend Charlotte (Margot Robbie) arrives to stay with the family, and Tim is instantly smitten with her. While she and Kit Kat are sunbathing, Charlotte asks Tim to rub sunscreen on her back. He jumps with excitement at the request and as he tries to squeeze the tube, he squirts a big load of sunscreen on Charlotte's back. Tim awkwardly runs away into the house and into the closet to go back to this moment. He now acts more laid back and suave, then gently applies sunscreen to Charlotte's back.On the eve of Charlotte's last day with the family, Tim goes into her room to ask her a question. Before he says anything, she says he had better not ask any question about love, as Kit Kat said he may have, but that's exactly what he was going to ask. Although Charlotte finds him sweet, she tells him he shouldn't have waited 'til her last night to make a move and that he should've tried earlier. This leads him to walk into the closet next to her room and go back a month, midway through her stay, to make a move. Charlotte is more interested, but then says they should wait until her last night to see how she feels. Tim eventually realizes that no matter how much he travels back in time, he cannot make Charlotte fall in love with him, and so she leaves him with a broken heart.After the summer ends, Tim moves to London to pursue his career as a lawyer. He moves in with a family friend named Harry Chapman (Tom Hollander), a grouchy playwright. He then starts work at a law firm and makes friends with a young man named Rory (Joshua McGuire), who spends a lot of time close to Tim as he continues his search for a girlfriend.One evening, Jay takes Tim to a restaurant where they are paired up with blind dates in a dark room. Tim spends the night talking to a American-accented girl named Mary (Rachel McAdams) while Jay is with her friend Joanna (Vanessa Kirby). Tim and Mary hit it off while Joanna hardly shows interest in Jay. The guys meet the girls outside and Tim is enchanted by Mary's beauty, even though she doesn't see herself as being particularly attractive. Tim says he admires her dress and her fringe hairstyle. Before she and Joanna leave, Tim manages to get Mary's phone number.Tim returns home to find Harry bitter over a failed performance at his play where one of his actors forgot his lines onstage. This inspires Tim to start the night over so he can join Harry at the play to change his mood. Tim goes to the dressing room of one of the main actors (Richard Griffiths- his last onscreen appearance) to encourage him to give his script another look over. The actor rudely tells Tim off, but then does read through his script. Tim and Harry watch the play and the actor delivers his lines spot on, to which the audience applauds. Unfortunately, as it turns out, it is another actor (Richard E. Grant) who completely freezes onstage. Tim leaves to go back in time and go backstage to hold up cue cards for the actor to look to, which allows him to recite his lines perfectly and also receive applause. After the show, Tim goes to call Mary, only to see her number isn't listed in his phone. He rushes to the restaurant where they met and is told by the host that Mary and Joanna had already left, and since they payed in cash, he can't give Tim anymore information.Harry reads the paper the next morning to find a glowing review for his play, though what catches Tim's eye is an ad featuring Kate Moss, since he and Mary chatted about her when they first met. This leads him to go to a museum featuring an exhibit with Kate Moss pictures, hoping to find Mary there. He goes for days upon days with no luck until Kit Kat comes by to help him out. Finally, Mary strolls by, and Tim seizes the opportunity to talk to her. He tells her it's good to see her, but she tells him that they've never met. He says he knows her name is Mary, but it only makes her a bit uncomfortable. He leaves rather embarrassed, but Kit Kat convinces him to go back, just as Joanna arrives. Tim convinces Mary to let him tag along as long as he assures her he's not a lunatic or an odd fringe fetishist. He joins them for lunch and learns that Mary has a boyfriend. Said boyfriend, Rupert (Harry Hadden-Paton), arrives to join the girls. Tim starts asking pressing questions about how they met and where, which happens to be at a party Joanna threw the previous week at her flat. She even gives Tim the specific address to the place, which is enough information for Tim to run into the mens room to time travel again.Tim runs to Joanna's party in time to find Mary sitting by herself near the window. He starts to chat her up, first coming off as awkward, but then convinces her to leave the party so they can have dinner together, thus allowing Mary to never meet Rupert. On their date, Tim learns that Mary works for a book publisher, and they have another chat about Kate Moss. After dinner, Tim walks Mary home and they kiss for the first time. She invites him inside for sex, which doesn't go smoothly the first time. Tim goes back in time to try again, which turns out better, but he tries once more, being more assertive and leaving both himself and Mary very satisfied.Tim and Mary officially start dating, going through many months together through the train station as a musical group plays a romantic song through their montage of love. One day, Mary's parents come to visit from America, though she springs it on Tim at the last minute just as they're coming up to their apartment. She warns him that her parents are very conservative and to not mention their intimacy. They arrive at the door and Tim foolishly blurts out that they do not have oral sex. Naturally, he goes into a nearby closet and back in time to undo this and he has a meal with Mary and her parents, leading Mary to say that she loves Tim.One evening, Tim and Rory go to watch a play, and Tim notices Charlotte there with her friend Tina (Catherine Steadman). After the play, Tim goes to say hi to Charlotte, and she introduces Tina as her girlfriend. This gives Tim the wrong idea that she rejected him because he believes she was a lesbian, though she says that's not the kind of girlfriend she meant. He goes back to undo this, though he still makes a blundered remark about misusing ""girlfriend"" to make someone think she's gay, when it turns out that Tina really is gay, but she is not Charlotte's lover. Tim goes back in time a third time to correct this, but instead doesn't approach Charlotte. However, Charlotte happens to spot him as he is leaving with Rory. She chats him up and then goes to have dinner with Tina, only to come back moments later to invite Tim to join her while she ditches Tina. The two have dinner and then go back to her place. Charlotte begins to invite him in, but Tim sees where this is going and he tells her there is something he needs to do.Tim runs back to his apartment to find Mary sleeping. He wakes her up to propose to her, though she is too tired and half-asleep to respond. He time travels to hire a jazz band to play music and approach her more gently to ask her to marry him. She says yes and thanks him for not doing a grand public proposal.Tim and Mary visit Tim's family to give them the news. He finds Kit Kat, who tells him she's been let go from another job. She runs into the living room to tackle Mary and kiss her cheek repeatedly. Over dinner, Tim announces to the family that he and Mary are going to get married, and they are planning on doing it soon as they are also going to have a baby. The family is overjoyed to hear this news. That evening, Tim and Mary start making plans, such as using the song ""Il Mondo"" at the wedding, where they'll get married, who Tim's best man will be, and where they will spend their honeymoon.The day of the wedding arrives. Even though it starts pouring rain, everything turns out fun and enjoyable for the couple. During the reception, where Rory is the best man, he starts to give an awkward speech, leading Tim to time travel and pick Harry as his best man. Harry starts making rude comments toward Tim, which makes him go back to pick Jay. This is just as bad since Jay starts making crude sexual references, forcing Tim to just pick his Dad as the final best man. James ends up giving a half-assed speech, so James decides to time travel himself to give a much nicer speech in which he states he's only loved three men - Uncle Desmond, BB King, and Tim.Not long after, Mary gives birth to her and Tim's first child, a girl they name Posy. They eventually move into a house of their own, even though Tim states they can hardly afford it, but he and Mary are happy nonetheless. One year later on Posy's first birthday, Tim's family arrives but they are still expecting Kit Kat. There is a knock at the door, but it turns out to be Jimmy Kincade. Tim asks about Kit Kat and Jimmy says that he got into a fight with her and she had been drinking earlier. Tim and Mary rush to the hospital to find out that Kit Kat was in a car accident due to her driving drunk. Tim time travels to bring Kit Kat to his house before she drives anywhere. He takes her for a walk on the beach to confront her over her problems with Jimmy. He then admits his secret to her and brings Kit Kat into a closet to time travel back to the New Year's Eve party (from the beginning of the film) where she first met Jimmy. She is just as surprised to find herself in her old clothes as Tim was at the beginning. Tim holds Kit Kat away from walking to Jimmy, and they see him approach another girl. Kit Kat realizes what a jerk Jimmy is, and she goes over to him to punch him square in the face.Tim takes Kit Kat back to the present and her memory has been altered, so she tells Tim that she is now with Jay. Tim is pleased to see that Kit Kat is happier with Jay, and he goes back home. When he goes to play with Posy, he is shocked to see that his daughter is now a boy. Tim time travels back to the day of the child's birth to meet his father. James tells his son that because the child was born in between the time-traveling Tim did with Kit Kat, he altered the time-line so that he instead had a son. Tim realizes he must undo Kit Kat's new time-line so that Posy is born. Kit Kat still suffers the car accident, but Tim and Mary stay by her bedside until she vows to break up with Jimmy and maintain her job. Before he leaves, Tim tells Kit Kat that Jay has always had a crush on her and that she should talk to him.Sure enough, Posy is still there, and Tim plays with his daughter. He tells Mary he wants another child, though Mary doesn't want to go through the process again. Despite this, they have another baby, this time a boy named Jeff.One evening, Tim and Mary are going out to have dinner with Mary's publisher. She goes through a bunch of dress changes because she is unsatisfied with how she looks despite Tim telling her she looks lovely in anything. Mary eventually goes back to the very first dress she tried on. She asks Tim where Posy is, and he tells her he left her downstairs. Unfortunately, he left her with the publisher's manuscript, which Posy colored over in crayon and put through the paper shredder. Mary is furious, and as Tim tries to walk out so he can undo this via time travel, Mary does not let him leave. The phone then rings and she answers angrily, then apologizes when she finds out it's Tim's mother. She passes the phone to him and Tim's face becomes worried when he speaks to his mother.Tim and Mary go with Kit Kat back to the family's home in Cornwall. Kit Kat runs inside tearfully while Tim asks his mother how she is. She responds ""I am absolutely uninterested in a life without your father."" Uncle Desmond tells Tim that James has lung cancer. He adds that on Tim's wedding day when James told Desmond he loved him that it was the happiest day of his life, and now learning of this news makes this the worst day. Tim meets with his dad and learns that he has merely weeks left. He admits that he's been time-traveling a lot to give himself more time to spend with his family and to read a lot of books. He then tells Tim he has another secret to tell him.Tim narrates that his father gave him a two-part plan to enjoy his life. The first part is to go through a day normally as it plays out - we see Tim going to work, watching Rory get chastised by their boss, going to get lunch, and going to a courtroom case with Rory that turns out to be successful, living the day with the stresses he ought to face. The second part is to go back in time and relive the day again while embracing it for what it is. He relives that day with a more upbeat feel, even allowing Rory to enjoy the day.The day comes for James's funeral. While everybody is getting ready, Tim time travels to a moment with his father, letting him know that he is arriving from the funeral. He sits down with James to listen to him read a passage from a Charles Dickens novel.Some time after the funeral, Mary tells Tim that she wants a third child, this one being the ""insurance baby"" - as she explains, in case one of their children ends up being smart and the other doesn't, there can be ""two happy dummies"" instead of one miserable one. Tim is on board with the idea, though he realizes that this means he would have to permanently let his father go. Over the following nine months as Mary is pregnant with their third child, Tim time travels to visit his father on a daily basis. On the ninth month, as Mary is nearly ready to deliver, Tim visits his father one last time. They play table tennis, and James asks what his reward should be. Tim says he will give him a kiss, and from the look on his face, James is able to determine what this means. Tim goes over to give his father a kiss, and then the two go into a dark place to time travel together to a day when Tim was a child. He and his father spend the day together at the beach.Tim and Mary's third child is born, a girl named Jo. Kit Kat and Jay have also gotten married and had a child of their own. By this time, Tim has decided that he may now live his life without time travel, as it is perfect the way it is. He kisses Mary as she lays in bed while he goes to take his children, now slightly older, off to school.The film ends with a brief montage with most of the other characters (Rory, Harry, Tim's mother, Kit Kat, Joanna, etc.) enjoying their lives one day at a time.The End."

For Llewyn however, life seems to just repeat itself.—garykmcd It's the middle of winter, 1961. Greenwich Village based folk singer Llewyn Davis, formerly one half of Timlin and Davis who had a modicum of success especially within the local scene, is trying to eke out a solo career. The dissolution of Timlin and Davis was due to circumstances outside of Llewyn's control, there no possibility of a reunion.

And he of late seems to be accumulating more and more stuff, including a cat, he having nowhere to put any of it permanently unless he were to dispose of these items. He may only be able to endure getting figuratively pushed down in the pursuit of a career before something has to change in his life.—Huggo Idealistic young folk singer Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) struggles to make a name for himself in the Greenwich Village folk scene of the early 1960s in this fictional period drama from Joel and Ethan Coen. As the harsh winds of winter blow through the streets of New York City, the homeless singer/songwriter drifts from couch to couch in search of his big break. Feeling that he's finally burned his bridge with longtime friends and fellow folk singers Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan), and convinced that his recent work on a novelty song will lead him nowhere, Llewyn hitches a ride to Chicago with the mysterious Roland Turner (John Goodman) and his taciturn valet Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund) on a mission to audition for famed impresario Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham). Meanwhile, Llewyn discovers that he himself may be the biggest obstacle on his arduous road to success.. In February 1961, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a struggling folk singer (previously a merchant marine) in New York City's Greenwich Village. His musical partner, Mike, has committed suicide; Llewyn's recent solo album Inside Llewyn Davis is not selling; he has no money and is sleeping on the couches of friends and acquaintances.
Llewyn performs in the Gaslight Cafe (""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me""), and club owner Pappi (Max Casella) tells him someone is waiting for him. Outside, a shadowy man in a suit beats Llewyn for having heckled a performance at the venue the previous night.Llewyn sleeps at the Upper West Side apartment of his older friends the Gorfeins. The next morning, he listens to one track from his and Mike's album ""If We Had Wings"" (""Dink's Song"", not to be confused with another traditional ballad, ""Fare Thee Well (Ten Thousand Miles)"").[6] When Llewyn leaves the apartment, the Gorfeins' orange tabby cat (a male) gets locked out. Llewyn takes the cat to the West Village apartment of his friends Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan). Llewyn visits his manager, who explains that Llewyn's album is not selling, but claims he sent a copy to Chicago producer Bud Grossman (a character based on impresario Albert Grossman).Jean secretly tells Llewyn she is pregnant, and fearing that she was impregnated by Llewyn instead of Jim, asks him to pay for an abortion. The three friends attend the Gaslight Cafe. Llewyn unsuccessfully asks Jim for money. Jim, Jean, and their guest Troy Nelson (Stark Sands) perform ""Five Hundred Miles"". The next morning, it seems that the Gorfeins' cat escapes again.Llewyn visits his sister in Woodside, Queens, hoping to borrow money, and tells her to throw out a box of his papers. On Jim's invitation, Llewyn, as part of the ""John Glenn Singers"", records a novelty song with Jim and Al Cody (Adam Driver), ""Please Mr. Kennedy"". Llewyn needs money immediately and agrees to $200, with no royalties.
At the gynecologist's office, Llewyn sets up Jean's appointment. The doctor says that two years previously, Llewyn had paid in advance for another woman who then decided to keep the baby and moved to Akron. Llewyn and Jean argue about his lack of direction. On the street Llewyn grabs what appears to be the Gorfeins' orange cat; that evening he takes the cat back, and is invited in to have dinner. He is rude the Gorfeins' guests and when asked to play after dinner reluctantly starts playing ""Fare Thee Well"". Mrs. Gorfein starts to sing the harmony -- which was Mike's part -- but Llewyn snaps, insulting the Gorfeins and their guests. Mrs. Gorfein leaves the table crying, coming back when she discovers that the orange cat is not theirs; Llewyn takes the cat and leaves.Llewyn rides with two musicians driving to Chicago: the laconic Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund), a beat poet, and the disagreeable Roland Turner (John Goodman), a jazz musician. Roland insults Llewyn: demeaning folk music, making fun of his name, and ridiculing a grown man traveling with a cat. Later Llewyn plays his guitar (""Green, Green Rocky Road""). At a roadside restaurant, Roland collapses from a heroin overdose in the bathroom. The three continue, eventually stopping on the side of the highway that night to rest. When a police officer tells them to move on, Johnny resists and is arrested. Left without the keys, Llewyn abandons the car, with the cat and the unconscious Roland inside.In Chicago, Llewyn seeks out Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), who says he never received a copy of Llewyn's record, but agrees to an audition. Llewyn plays ""The Death of Queen Jane""; Grossman is not encouraging.
Llewyn hitchhikes back to New York and hits what may be yet another or perhaps the same orange cat with the car he is driving. He considers briefly detouring to see his son in Akron. Back in New York he pays $148 to rejoin the merchant marines. He also visits his ailing father, singing him ""The Shoals of Herring"". Llewyn then starts to say goodbye to Jean; she tells him that Pappi will let him play at the Gaslight again. Llewyn searches for his shipping license required to ship out but it was in the box his sister threw out. The union office can issue a new license, but at a price that Llewyn cannot now afford.At the Gaslight, an Irish quartet performs ""The Auld Triangle"". Pappi states that he had sex with Jean, suggesting that he pressures female performers he finds attractive to do so in order to perform at the Gaslight. Llewyn becomes upset and loudly heckles an older woman playing ""The Storms Are On the Ocean"". He is thrown out and goes to the Gorfeins' apartment. They graciously welcome him; he is amazed to see that their orange cat Ulysses found his way home, arriving the previous day.The next morning is nearly identical to his stay at the Gorfeins' at the beginning of the film, although this time he blocks the cat from escaping. On the street he gazes at a poster for The Incredible Journey, wondering about all his sightings of an orange cat.He performs at the Gaslight, singing ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" and finishing with a raw, emotional solo performance of ""If I Had Wings"". Pappi teases him about his heckling the previous evening and tells him that a friend is waiting outside. As Llewyn leaves the building, a young Bob Dylan takes the stage and begins to sing. Behind the Gaslight, Llewyn is confronted by a shadowy man in a suit, who beats him for rudely heckling the previous night's performance, who he reveals was his wife. Llewyn watches the man get in a taxi, commenting ""Au revoir""."

After a spectacular escape from an FBI prisoner convoy, the most notorious, wanted drug kingpin in the hemisphere is hurtling toward the border at 200 mph in a specially outfitted car with a hostage and a fierce army of gang members. He is headed, it turns out, straight for Summerton Junction, where the whole of U.S. law enforcement will have their last opportunity to make a stand and intercept him before he slips across the border forever.

When the powerful Mexican drug lord Gabriel Cortez escapes from the convoy of the FBI under the command of Agent John Bannister while being transported to another prison, he heads in a Corvette in the direction of Sommerton expecting to reach Mexico.

However, in the meantime, the ruthless drug kingpin, Gabriel Cortez, escapes from FBI custody, dashing to the border of Mexico through the peaceful community of Sommerton, as agent John Bannister and his elite crew are trying to gain on him. Suddenly, Ray is back in action, and under those circumstances, the Sheriff and his motley crew of deputies are now the only ones capable of stopping the sadistic criminal. Nevertheless, are they ready for the ultimate confrontation where anything goes?—Nick Riganas Sheriff Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a man who has resigned himself to a life of fighting what little crime takes place in sleepy border town Sommerton Junction, Arizona, after leaving his LAPD post following a bungled operation that left him wracked with failure and defeat after his partner was crippled and his team decimated. The crimes experienced in Sommerton range from the Mayor parking his Camaro in the fire lane and vintage arms collector Lewis Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) firing off guns at slabs of meat with the deputies. One night, international drug lord Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) makes a daring escape from FBI custody in Las Vegas and speeds off in a modified Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1, taking Agent Ellen Richards (Génesis Rodríguez) as his hostage as he races southbound toward Mexico at speeds over 200 mph. Agent John Bannister (Forrest Whitaker) has a blockade set up in Bullhead City, Arizona, but Cortez's men mow down the police officers on site and clear the road for him to continue his getaway. Cortez also uses his extraordinary driving skills to immobilize two SWAT vehicles headed toward Summerton Junction. Before flying to Arizona, Agent Bannister has his team do a financial background check on all agents involved to find out how Cortez managed to escape so easily.Sometime past 4:00 in the morning, Owens dispatches deputies Jerry Bailey (Zach Gilford) and Sarah Torrance (Jaimie Alexander) to visit the residence of the local farmer Parsons (Harry Dean Stanton), who has suddenly missed his usual milk delivery at the diner. After discovering that Parsons has been murdered, the deputies follow a trail of tire tracks that lead them to Cortez's henchman Thomas Burrell (Peter Stormare) and his mercenary cutthroats, who are planting a mobile assault bridge across the canyon that marks the U.S./Mexico border. Bailey is fatally shot in the middle of a shootout between the deputies and the thugs before Owens rushes in to bring his officers back to his precinct. Shortly after being notified by Agent Bannister of Cortez's presence, Owens gathers Torrance and senior Deputy Mike ""Figgy"" Figuerola (Luis Guzmán). He also deputizes jailed local Frank Martinez (Rodrigo Santoro), a former Marine with PTSD who developed a streak of never finishing what he started. Because Bailey was his friend, Martinez insists that he will not falter. Finally, Owens recruits Dinkum to protect their town. Dinkum agrees only if he becomes a deputy and if he keeps the gun he used at the beginning of the movie (having gotten in trouble for it previously).At 7:10 AM, Owens and his deputies have the town's main road barricaded with cars when Burrell and his men arrive, prompting a lengthy firefight. Armed only with a Tommy Gun, Figuerola holds off the thugs before being injured by a sniper. Owens and Dinkum mow down a majority of the thugs with a Vickers machine gun dubbed ""Nazi-Killer"" mounted on the back of a school bus, while Torrance snipes several gunmen on the rooftops. After Owens kills Burrell, Cortez's Corvette eventually arrives in town, veering past the barricade as Owens and the deputies shoot at it. Cortez ejects Agent Richards from the car before speeding through a corn field. Suddenly, he encounters the Mayor's red Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 commandeered by Owens before both cars collide with a tractor. A dazed Cortez continues his escape on foot, but Owens meets him at the bridge. Owens ignores Cortez's bribe offers before both men wrestle each other. Despite sustaining slashes and stab wounds from Cortez's push dagger, Owens defeats the drug lord and handcuffs him before dragging him back into town with the battered Camaro. Agent Bannister arrives to take Cortez back into custody and arrests Agent Richards for taking the drug lord's bribe and aiding in his escape. Deputies Figuerola and Dinkum are taken to the hospital to be treated for their wounds. Martinez turns in the deputy's badge, Bailey's badge, that Owens had given him earlier.

This movie was inspired by the true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), the illegitimate biracial daughter of Royal Navy Captain Sir John Lindsay (Matthew Goode). Raised by her aristocratic great-uncle Lord William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) and his wife (Emily Watson), Belle's lineage affords her certain privileges, yet the color of her skin prevents her from fully participating in the traditions of her social standing. Left to wonder if she will ever find love, Belle falls for an idealistic young vicar's son bent on change, who, with her help, shapes Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England.—Fox Searchlight Pictures Set in eighteenth century England, based on a true story, Dido Elizabeth Belle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is the illegitimate, biracial daughter of Royal Navy Captain Sir John Lindsay (Matthew Goode) and a black woman with whom he had an affair while serving overseas. Lindsay brings her to his uncle Lord William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) who along with his wife Lady Mansfield (Emily Watson) are already raising Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon), another niece the same age as Dido. Though Lady Mansfield fears scandal having a dark-skinned child as part of the home, Dido's father reminds them that his daughter does have the right to live there because of her lineage, and Lord Mansfield, a Lord Chief Justice of Britain, agrees. Belle and Elizabeth quickly become best friends, and when they come of age, each begins courting suitors. Elizabeth is pursued by James Ashford (Tom Felton), a smarmy and racist manipulator who wants to marry her in order to please his equally conniving mother, Lady Ashford (Miranda Richardson), by increasing his own family's wealth and standing, while Dido proves to be alluring to James' brother Oliver (James Norton). However, Dido's deepest affections are for John Davinier (Sam Reid), an idealistic young lawyer who is trying to sway Lord Mansfield on a crucial case before the high court that will have profound implications for Britain's slave trade. It's the late eighteenth century.

While Dido and Elizabeth have always treated each other as sisters and have considered Lord and Lady Mansfield like their own parents, Dido, although living in comfort, is not afforded all that is given to Elizabeth, due to the color of her skin. As such, Dido is not to come out as Elizabeth is in finding a suitable husband who can raise her status in society. Conversely, Sir John, upon his death, provided financially for Dido, unlike Elizabeth's father, who has made no such financial arrangement for her, making Dido financially secure regardless of what happens with her in terms of matrimony. Regardless, Dido still wants all that it means to come out, she being casually courted by Oliver Ashford (James Norton), against the wishes of his mother and brother, Lady Ashford (Miranda Richardson) and James Ashford (Tom Felton), who in turn is courting Elizabeth. Bigoted Lady Ashford and James do whatever in their power to make Dido's life a living hell, especially if it looks as if she and Oliver plan to marry. Meanwhile, Dido befriends John Davinier (Sam Reid), the son of a local vicar and an aspiring lawyer, who is researching a case for Lord Mansfield regarding an insurance claim filed by a slave ship's owner for loss of slaves at sea due to illness. Lord Mansfield and John end up having a falling out about one aspect of the case, John wanting the case to lead to abolishing of slavery in England. Through Dido secretly helping John with the case behind Lord Mansfield's back, she and John fall in love. Such a relationship, if it comes to light, having many obstacles including the objections of Lord and Lady Mansfield in favor of Oliver Ashford as a more suitable husband for Dido.—Huggo This period drama is inspired by the life of Dido Elizabeth Belle (Mbatha-Raw), who was the illegitimate daughter of John Lindsay, a Captain in the Royal Navy, and a Caribbean woman named Maria Belle who gave birth to their child in 1762. Belle's racial background renders her an outsider in her high society circle, and her uncle's role in a slavery case places her in the spotlight. Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay was born in 1761, the natural daughter of Maria Belle, an enslaved African woman in the West Indies, and Captain Sir John Lindsay, a British Royal Navy officer. After the death of Dido's mother, Captain Lindsay takes Dido to England in 1765 and entrusts her to his uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, the Lord Chief Justice, and his wife, Elizabeth who live at Kenwood House, an estate in Hampstead outside London. Lord and Lady Mansfield raise Dido as a free gentlewoman, together with their niece Lady Elizabeth Murray, who came to live with them after her mother died and her father remarried. When the two nieces reach adulthood, the Mansfields commission an oil portrait of their two great-nieces, but Dido is unhappy about sitting for it as she is worried that it will portray her as a subordinate, like other portraits she has seen depicting aristocrats with black servants. Dido's father dies and leaves her £2,000 a year. Lady Elizabeth, by contrast, will have no income from her father, whose new wife has been named his sole heir. Arrangements are made for Elizabeth to have her coming out to society, but Lord and Lady Mansfield believe no gentleman will agree to marry Dido because of her mixed-race status.Lord Mansfield agrees to take a vicar's son, John Davinier, into an apprenticeship for law. In 1783, Mansfield hears the case of Gregson v. Gilbert, regarding the payment of an insurance claim, for slaves killed when thrown overboard by the captain of a slave-ship an event now known as the Zong massacre. Dido helps her uncle with his correspondence and after John tells her about the Zong case, she begins sneaking correspondence to him which he believes will advance the cause of the abolitionists. Lord Mansfield and John have a disagreement on the main issue of the case and John is told not to see Dido again. Didos aunts, Lady Mansfield and Lady Mary Murray, Lord Mansfield's sister, seek to steer Dido into an engagement with Oliver Ashford, son of a scheming grand dame and younger brother to the bigoted James Ashford. At first James is interested in Elizabeth but stops courting her once he finds out she will have no inheritance. Oliver proposes to Dido and she accepts, even though she continues to see John. After James threatens Dido with violence, she tells Elizabeth and says she will give part of her inheritance to her for a dowry so she can find a different match. Lord Mansfield finds out about Dido's visits to John and confronts both of them. During the confrontation, John professes his love for Dido. Sometime later, Dido meets with Oliver and breaks off their engagement.Dido is relieved when the painting is unveiled, showing her as Elizabeth's equal. She tells Lord Mansfield that the portrait commission proves that he can defy convention. Dido sneaks into the balcony of the Inn of Court, so that she can hear Lord Mansfield narrowly rule that the Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, were not due insurance payments for the loss of slaves during a voyage, when they were thrown overboard by the crew. The ship's officers claimed they ordered this action because they were out of potable water. It appeared to Lord Mansfield that the slaves were over-crowded, making them sick and not likely to fetch a high price at auction, so the officers decided they would be worth more in insurance payments after their loss. Lord Mansfield sees John and Dido outside the Court after his ruling and says that Dido can only marry a gentleman. Therefore, he agrees to resume John's apprenticeship in law, so that he can become a gentleman.On-screen text informs the viewer that Dido and John married and had two children, that Elizabeth also married and had children, and that the painting hung at Kenwood House until 1922, when it was moved to Scone palace.© Wikipedia"
Getaway,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2167202/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"To save his kidnapped wife, Brent Magna must drive at the orders of a mysterious man. Former race car driver Brent Magna is pitted against the clock as he commandeers a custom Shelby Super Snake Mustang, taking it and its unwitting owner on a high-speed adventure at the command of a mysterious villain on a race against time to save the life of his kidnapped wife.—anonymous It's the Christmas season. In Sofia, Bulgaria, Leanne Magna has been abducted in a targeted kidnapping. The reason is that the unknown kidnapper has a special mission for her husband, ex-race car driver Brent Magna, which primarily requires high performance driving through the busy streets of the city. Brent quit driving professionally after he realized his publicity was greater than his belief in himself. He has lived a somewhat checkered life since. The kidnapper has provided Brent with a specially equipped sports car complete with cameras and video phone so that the kidnapper can watch his every move and so that the two can converse. Any deviation, intended or otherwise, from the kidnapper's instructions means that he will kill Leanne, including no contacting the police which also means not getting caught by the police. Things get complicated when a teenaged girl attempts an armed carjacking with Brent still in the car. Although the girl has no idea what's going on, Brent learns that she is all part of the plan, she who must now go along for the ride. As Brent and the girl begin to trust each other, they come to the conclusion that the kidnapper has no reason to keep Leanne or either of them alive after whatever the mission is completed. As such, they have to figure out what the kidnapper's end game is without him knowing for them to have any hope of keeping Leanne and themselves alive.—Huggo Washed up former race driver Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) arrives home to find his house ransacked and his wife, Leanne, missing. He then receives a phone call from a mysterious man known only as The Voice (Jon Voight), who reveals himself as the kidnapper of Magna's wife. The man tells Magna that he must follow a set of instructions precisely in order to be reunited with his wife. The Voice orders Magna to steal a specially customized Shelby Mustang from a parking garage. The Voice warns Magna that if he does not follow the instructions or is caught, Leanne will die.. We open to Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) arriving home. The place has been ransacked, with the Christmas decorations destroyed and shattered glass everywhere. In addition, there is an obvious sign of a struggle, given Brent finds blood on the floor. He calls out to his wife and gets no response. Suddenly, his phone ringsCut to a parking garage where a tricked out Shelby Super Snake Mustang waits. Brent steals it and escapes the parking garage despite security trying to stop him.We flashback to him getting the call; a middle-aged man, simply called The Voice (Jon Voight) tells him that his wife has been taken and if Brent wants her back, he will have to do EXACTLY what he is told. The Voice tells him to steal the car. It has been outfitted with cameras to watch his every move, and is armor plated to deflect gunfire. Brent is warned by The Voice that he must do whatever he is directed to do. If he refuses a task, fails in it, or is caught by the police, then his wife will die.Brent sees two cops chasing him and speeds off. Being a skilled driver, he is able to think quickly on his feet to evade them well, eventually setting a trap to cause one to crash into the other. Two more cop cars find him and give pursuit. Brent makes them follow him into a sewer gully and causes them to crash into deep water held in the ravine. He then backs out of the ravine and drives away, free of police attention for the moment.The Voice calls Brent and directs him to a mountain. Once there, he called again and reminded of the rules; he does his tasks without question, and his wife lives. Disobey or get caught, and she dies. Brent requests proof of life and he is briefly allowed to hear her voice before The Voice cuts back in and tells him they will be in touch and to dump his phone. Brent tosses his phone and drives off.We are told that the story is taking place in Sofia, Bulgaria.We see Brent's wife, Leanne (Rebecca Budig) taken by the men who kidnapped her into a grimy holding room. Her cries to be let go are ignored.Brent drives and thinks of his wife.Brent receives a call from the phone system that has been added into the car. The Voice directs him towards his first task. He tells Brent to speed up and take some perilous turns, eventually being forced to crash through a park, ice rink, and shopping center, nearly killing numerous civilians in the process. The Voice calls to congratulate him and tells him to keep moving. Brent is ordered to crash into a water truck and run through a red lighted intersection, causing accidents in his wake. Brent is then ordered to park in a construction zone and await further instructions.Waiting there, someone opens the passenger door and sticks a gun in Brents face. Known simply as The Kid (Selena Gomez), she is apparently a car thief tells him to get out. Brent refuses and begins to struggle with her. The Voice calls and tells Brent to take her with him. Having no choice, Brent races off with her. Brent asks what he should do.Kill her, The Voice says.Kid looks horrified and Brent balks at doing it. The Voice says if he doesn't, his wife will die instead and gives him till the count of three. Brent points the gun at her face but cant do it. ""I'm not a killer"", Brent says. The Voice says that it is a good choice, as he will need her.Yet another cop car spots them, and Brent drives to evade him. Kid is screaming for him to pull over but of course Brent cant do it. He is eventually able to get rid of it, causing it to crash. What the hell did you do?! Kid screams. She tries to yell out of the window to get a cops attention until Brent pulls her back inside.An unmarked cop car joins the pursuit and Brent is forced to hit him and cause his car to flip three times into another. Kid yells at Brent for ruining her car with all the cameras and other high tech added to it. Brent doesnt know what she is talking about. This is my car, Kid says. She was given an anonymous tip by a cop that someone had stole it and told her where it was seen. Brent tells her no cop would do that, and them meeting was no accident. It was planned.We see The Voice at a bar. He maps Brent's location on a map then sets more cops onto him by hacking the police scanners.Kid and Brent talk. Brent tries to explain what is going on but doesn't know much. He doesn't recognize The Voice who is ordering him around.The Voice calls him and tells him of his second task. Brent will have numerous cops on his tail and has four minutes to escape. If he doesn't, Leanne dies. Having no choice once more, Brent evades numerous cop cars that are thrown at him, ramming one, forcing another off the road, and causing two to hit a truck. He drives down some stairs and gets away to The Voices satisfaction before time runs out. They continue to drive.We cut back to The Voice. His computer says two streets have been blocked.Kid is angered about the damage done to her car as it was a birthday gift by her father. She reaches into the glove compartment and finds her hidden iPad. Kid is apparently a hacker of some kind. She tracks the camera feed and sees that it is pinging off a government server. She notices several other feeds including a parking garage.The Voice calls again. He speaks of an article speaking of Brents racing career and tells him about the third task. The Voice wants them to go to a power plant and upload a flash drive into the system by 11:30 p.m. When Kid asks why he needs the power gone, The Voice tells her it would be wise not to ask too many questions.Having time to kill, Brent and The Kid park the car nearby the plant. Kid is livid since she believes Brent is a criminal. Brent explains that he used to be. He was formerly a NASCAR driver that washed out due to his dangerous driving skills that led to numerous wrecks. In debt, he became a wheelman and did some things he wasn't proud off. He changed for his wife Leanne, and they moved back to her home country to start over.Kid tells Brent she is a daughter of a Bank CEO that moved her here two years ago. He is distant and basically gives her money instead of actual affection.Kid then breaks down the big picture that Brent has apparently missed; when the tasks are over, why would The Voice ever give Brent his wife back? If it was the Kid in control, she would kill Brent and Leanne anyway. Oh shit, Id kill me too, Kid says, realizing they are all expendable. Brent says it is time to go and they drive to the plant.Kid gets out of the car saying she will hack the server. She uploads the data then hacks the computer to try and call 911. Thinking she got through, she tries to tell what has happened, only for The Voice to laugh at her, telling her as smart as she is, hes smarter. The Voice tells Kid to look up and she sees herself on camera. The whole thing was a set up to incriminate her. He tells Kid to run as the plant overloads. Kid gets in the car and Brent drives off as the entire plant explodes, taking out several power grids in the city.Brent and Kid are confronted by more cops. Brent drives evasively to disable them.The Voice is at the bar. His computer says five key streets have been blocked. He grins.Taking a moment to breathe, Brent pulls over. Kid gets out and says she is leaving. She mentions the camera at the plant and tells Brent they are being set up for something big that The Voice is planning. They are doing everything so they will be arrested and the ones who planned this will have full deniability. ""I'm not dying for you"", Kid says. I have to take care of myself.Brent gets a call from The Voice, demanding to get Kid back. Brent says 'no'. Brent is then giving a video of Leanne surrounded by guards and then the feed cuts out, signifying to Brent that she has been killed. The Voice says he warned him about disobedience. Kid comes back and says she is sorry. Brent says none of this is her fault. Kid tells him that Leanne is still alive. The Voice wouldn't kill his only bargaining chip until everything is done.While being pursued, yet again by more cops, Kid looks at her iPad and examines the crash locations. She realizes the points will cause a major traffic jam, leaving only one way out of the city. Its an escape route, Brent says.The Voice calls again and gives Brent his final task, to rob a bank. Specifically, the bank that Kids father runs. Brent is ordered to turn around and go in the direction of the bank. Brent asks when he can see his wife again. The Voice tries to shut him up and Brent finally loses his patience. I need to know that she is all right and WHEN THIS SHIT IS GOING TO BE OVER! The Voice tells him to keep his cool and turn around NOW. Brent relents and turns around.As they drive and evade the police, Kid questions the plan. Her fathers bank isn't a normal bank; it is an investment firm with just computers. Brent and Kid realize there must be evidence of hidden bank accounts with billions of dirty money on one of the hard drives. The blocked streets and electricity outage would cause bank protocol to move the sensitive information to another destination. They are being used for the ultimate fall guys. Furthermore, Kid was used to make it appear that she was targeting her fathers bank because she was cut off financially by him.Brent has to cut through a warehouse and fight off cop cars and a motorcycle. He trips the motorcycle causing it to flip and have its driver smash into a cop cars window. He evades the others by well placed jumps and exits the warehouse.Thinking quick, Kid uses her iPad to create a camera loop to trick The Voice. She thinks they are falling into a trap and wants to make sure. The loop will buy then time.Journeying near the bank, they see dozens of cop cars waiting. They finally realize that is all a set up. They would crash through the empty barricade, and rob an empty bank, while The Voice gets away with everything. Kid points out a nearby parking garage and they realize the hard drives are being moved from there.We see a security team moving the drives into an armored car when they hear motorcycles. Four motorcycle drivers with sub-machine guns attack the convoy, killing four guards. The drivers of the truck try to leave, only for the mercenaries to place bombs on the windows. The bombs kill them and cause them to crash the truck. Just as the mercenaries double to take them, Brent and The Kid drive up and intercept the drives to The Voices obvious surprise.As they drive off, The Voice calls them and threatens them but Brent shuts him up. We hold the cards now, Asshole! Kid yells to The Voices anger. The four motorcycles give chase. Brent tips one into a passing trolley. The other three shoot at the car but the bullets deflect due to the armor plating. Brent eventually causes the others to crash.Forced into a dead end surrounded by cops, Brent thinks fast. Taking Kids gun, he pretends to hold her hostage, causing the police to back off. They drive off once more.The Voice, though on the defensive, is still able to track the car. He calls one of his men and sends him the location.Brent pulls over to let Kid leave. Kid refuses to leave saying he would do something stupid without her. Just as they settle that, The Red Biker gives chase. They drive into a train yard where the Red Biker is shooting at them. Timing himself, Brent fires one shot that hits the Red Biker. He crashes into some machinery, causing a fireball chain reaction as Brent and Kid drive away.Brent calls The Voice and proposes a trade. He tells him to meet him at his workplace in two hours.Before they head there, Kid gets a brilliant idea. She tampers with the car cameras to make it a live feed to alert the police. That way, the authorities can see that they were entrapped and bring backup when things go bad.They head to an airport hangar. Five henchmen come out. Brent asks about his wife. The lead henchman asks about the Drives. Kid shows it. Brent asks about his wife. The lead henchman directs one of his men to get Leanne. The man then wants the drive, but Kid tells him to release Leanne first. He complies and Kid comes over to validate the drive. As she walks over, she notices an earpiece in the mans ear. She realizes The Voice is planning to kill them as soon as the transfer is done. The tech transfers the money and okays it to his boss. Cut to The Voice ordering his men to kill them all.Kid warns Brent, who shields his wife. He gets shot in the back just as the cops rush in and arrest the henchmen. In the confusion, The Voice, who had been hiding in one of the cars, grabs Kid and drives off. Brent had been only grazed by the bullet and sees Kid get kidnapped. Brent tells his wife he has to save her and tells Leanne to stay with the police and drives off.Kid uses her camera to link to her iPad to give Brent landmarks to follow. Brent sees it but he has his hands full. More of The Voices goons, this time outfitted with grenade launchers are pursuing him. They sandwich his car and try to grenade him several times. Brent is able to cause one to flip while he and the other car fishtail in an intersection. Brent cant get his car to start again and the other car is readying a grenade launcher. However, Brent is saved with an 18 wheeler clobbers the other car. He starts up the car, and drives away only to get caught in traffic. Remembering the blocked roads, and that there would be only one path out of the city, Brent turns around. He knows which way they are going.Taking the route, he comes up to the SUV where The Voice has kidnapped Kid. In an unbroken take, we watch through the windshield as both cars dodge traffic and each other. The Voice eventually drives into a park and tells Kid to get out. She is forced to jump out of the moving vehicle right into Brent's path. As she shields her face, Brent twists the wheel to miss her, causing his car to flip and crash right into the SUV driven by The Voice.Kid is able to get Brent out of the car as it bursts into flames. Police show up to put out the fires and put The Voice under arrest. Another police car shows up with Leanne and Brent realizes it is finally over. Kid jokes about how Brent owes her a new car and Brent replies it just needs a new paint job. Suddenly, a phone rings in Leanne's pocket. It isn't hers.Brent answers it to hear The Voice. Brent looks into the and the police arrest the mysterious man. Leanne and Magna are reunited. However, Magna receives a phone call from The Voice, revealing that the man who was busted was no more than a decoy. The Voice thanks Magna for his help and hangs up.Screen fades to the movie ends, movie closes, film ends to film closes with a thirteen years later, on the nightlife of Christmas Day, We see a satellite view. He had been directing all his men from a bar in the Malaysia and Singapore. He sees his new account balance and shut his laptop down, handing it to a henchman who locks it away in a special locking suitcase. He then walks out of the bar, completely getting away with the heist. The closing credits begin to roll."

Machete Kills,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2002718/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The U.S. government recruits Machete to battle his way through Mexico in order to take down an arms dealer who looks to launch a weapon into space. Patrolling the U.S. border with his gun-toting lover, Sartana, after the massacre inMachete (2010), the stone-faced, former Mexican Federale, Machete, receives a call from the president himself of the United States. Thirsting for retribution, Machete embarks on a deadly mission to bring to Texas the megalomaniac Mexican revolutionary, Marcos, who has a nuclear missile pointing at Washington, D.C. Now, Machete and the undercover agent, Miss San Antonio, have to stop a global war, as the shape-shifting assassin, La Camaleón, is hot on their trail. Can Machete's hungry blades avert the impending Armageddon?—Nick Riganas The film is preceded by a fake trailer for ""Machete Kills Again... In Space!"", which features the titular hero on an intergalactic mission, starring Danny Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, Alexa Vega, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber as a robot named Bleep (which Machete destroys), and Leonardo DiCaprio as ""The Man in the Silver Mask"" (with the sub-note that the actor playing the role is subject to change).The actual film starts off with a team of military men arriving at the Arizona-Mexico border, where they start unloading crates filled with high-tech weaponry. They're cornered by Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) and Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba), both of whom are aware that these men are planning on selling weapons to the cartel. Sure enough, the cartel arrive right on cue. They whip out their guns and kill all the military men. Machete and Sartana fight back, with Machete slaughtering them with his machete. The cartel leader prepares to kill Machete, stating that ""if a man kills a legend, he becomes a legend himself."" That's when three helicopters show up with masked men hopping out and shooting the cartel. Sartana pleads with Machete to help her fight these other men, and she goes around to the back of the military truck to find a large missile in the back. A man in a luchador mask walks up to her and shoots Sartana in the head, killing her. Machete finds her body and falls on his knees in despair, just as he is apprehended by the masked men.Machete is set to be hanged in the office of the racist redneck Sheriff Doakes (William Sadler) after being accused of murdering Sartana. Doakes tells his deputy Clebourne (Samuel Davis) to kick the stool from beneath Machete's feet, which he does, but Machete doesn't die. Instead, he stares viciously at the two men. The phone rings, and Clebourne answers, then passes it to Doakes, saying it's the President. Doakes answers and then grabs his gun to shoot the noose to free Machete. He takes the phone and growls, ""This is Machete.""Machete is escorted to Washington DC and to the White House to meet President Rathcock (Charlie Sheen; credited under his birth name Carlos Estevez), who informs Machete that a Mexican cartel member-turned-revolutionary named Marcos Mendez (Demian Bichir) has a plan to launch a powerful missile at Washington unless Mexico is invaded to put an end to the corruption within that country. Ratchcock orders Machete to find Mendez and kill him. Machete refuses the mission until Rathcock grants him U.S. citizenship and tells him to do this for his country and for the late Sartana.Arriving in San Antonio, Texas, Machete meets his handler, Blanca Vasquez, aka Miss San Antonio (Amber Heard). She shows off her arsenal of guns and blades, including a three-bladed machete that catches Machete's eye. She briefs him on Mendez's plan and tells him to go to Acapulco to find a young woman named Cereza (Vanessa Hudgens), as she will lead Machete to Mendez. Miss S.A. then has sex with Machete.Miss S.A. flies Machete to Acapulco, Mexico where he parachutes down to find a brothel run by Madame Desdemona (Sofia Vergara). She orders her band of prostitutes to make sure they get their earned money from any customer who comes in, then sends them away as Machete comes in. He takes out a picture of Cereza and requests to see her. Desdemona leaves to get her, only to come back with a gun. She fires at Machete, prompting him to run and get shot at by the other prostitutes. He runs into a room to find Cereza, who willingly goes with him. He grabs her and jumps out the window.Machete and Cereza wait at a dock for their ride to see Mendez. She reveals that she is Desdemona's daughter and that Mendez was once a normal man who became insane, earning him the nickname ""Mendez the Madman"". The two are picked up on a speedboat with a man named Zaror (Marko Zaror) and two revolutionaries. They all board a helicopter to head to Mendez's lair. While they're flying, Zaror says ""Mendez sends a message,"" and he shoots Cereza in the stomach and throws her out of the helicopter to her death.The helicopter arrives at Mendez's lair. True to his reputation, he is a maniacal man who has a very large missile standing in the middle of the room, and the trigger is wired to his heart, so if he dies, the missile launches. He says there are only two people who know how to disarm it. Zaror kills the only doctor in the room, which leaves only one other person who knows, and he is all the way back in the U.S. To make matters worse, Mendez pulls the trigger on his chest, which leaves 24 hours before the missile launches. Thinking quickly, Machete grabs Mendez and takes on his henchmen, using his triple-bladed Machete to slice into Zaror's stomach and make his way out while killing other goons. He knocks Mendez unconscious and runs to the helicopter. Zaror runs out to fight Machete, but he sticks his hand in Zaror's stomach to pull out his intestine and throw it into the helicopter's blades, pulling Zaror up and slicing him to pieces. Machete boards the helicopter with Mendez, then receives a call from Miss S.A. He tells her that he is taking Mendez across the border, leading her to call President Rathcock. Machete informs them both about the missile's trigger being wired to Mendez's heart, so he is going to find the man who sold him the missile, coming from a company called Voz Tech.As the helicopter flies over the ocean, two revolutionaries on a speedboat try to shoot at Machete. He jumps out with Mendez and lands in the boat. He knocks out one revolutionary while fighting the other, then grabbing a grappling hook, shooting it at the helicopter, and sticking it to the man, which pulls him up, shreds him, and causes the helicopter to explode. Machete then steers the boat to the docks, but there are more revolutionaries waiting for them. He sticks the gas in the speedboat on full speed and jumps out with Mendez, right before the boat flips over, crashes into the dock, and kills the men with the boat's turbines.Machete pulls Mendez to land, where Mendez suddenly drops his madman persona and begins to speak to him calmly. He appears to have no recollection of the trigger on his heart and is distraught when Machete tells him that he ordered Cereza to be killed.At a Mexican radio station, a goon enters and orders the host to read off an announcement over the radio: a hit has been issued on Machete and Mendez, offering over $20 million dollars to whoever kills them. This is heard by Machete's ally Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), as well as Doakes and Clebourne.Elsewhere in Mexico, a man (Walton Goggins) enters a bar. He asks for a martini but the bartender tells him they only serve tequila and chango. The man orders the chango and then reveals to the bartender that he is the notorious killer known as El Camaleon, for nobody has ever seen his face. He kills the bartender and the other two men in the bar, then leaves. He pulls off his mask to reveal a new disguise (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). He receives a notice about the hit on Machete, and then kills a tourist couple and takes their car.Machete and Mendez go to a Mexican restaurant where everybody recognizes them and watches them with the intent to kill. A cop named Chepo (Julio Oscar Mechoso) aims his gun at Mendez's head, calling him ""loco"" (""crazy"" in Spanish). This causes Mendez to revert to his madman persona and he begins to punch Chepo's face in, with Machete finally shooting him in the chest. The police arrive to arrest the two, forcing Machete to grab Mendez, kill the restaurant's workers, and cut the gas line to destroy the restaurant.Meanwhile, Desdemona is in her brothel whipping a man tied to a table while telling him why she hates men - her father used to sexually abuse her as a child until she chewed his balls off. She wraps the whip around the man's neck and breaks it. One of the prostitutes, named KillJoy (Alexa Vega) comes in to tell Desdemona about the hit on Machete. She then hands Desdemona a machine gun bra to prepare herself.El Camaleon (Gooding) arrives at a garage and learns that Machete was spotted in Villa Guerrera. He asks the man at the garage for directions, but when he fails to answer him properly, he kills the man. He then notices the camera which has captured his face. He shoots it and removes his mask to become a woman (Lady Gaga).Machete takes Mendez to a clinic after he was shot in the neck at the restaurant. While he's being treated, a prostitute spots them and informs Desdemona and her girls. Machete spots them and puts blood bags in the microwave, causing them explode and spray on the prostitutes. Desdemona opens fire with her machine gun bra, but Machete manages to outrun her. He grabs a defibrillator and uses it on the bra to throw Desdemona several feet away. He once again grabs Mendez and runs.The duo make it to a shop to get a car. There is a man in a wheelchair there who is willing to turn them in as a group of assassins arrive on the scene. Machete shoots the man's oxygen tank, which pushes the wheelchair into plain sight of the assassins, and they open fire on him and launch a rocket at the man. Machete and Mendez get into an armored vehicle and flee. As they continue to make their way to the border, Mendez tells Machete who he used to be - he was never part of the cartel, but rather, he was Mexico's first secret agent who planned to end the corruption in the country, but his supervisor betrayed him and had his wife and daughter beaten and murdered before his eyes. He went crazy and killed the supervisor and his men, leading him to join forces with the man who sold him the missile.With about 13 hours before the missile launches, Machete and Mendez arrive close to the border. However, Desdemona and her prostitutes are following, and El Camaleon (Gaga) is not far behind. Machete throws a blade into Desdemona's vehicle that is set to blow up, forcing her and her girls to jump from the vehicle. With it being stranded, it causes El Camaleon to hit the car and overturn his (or her) car. Desdemona runs out with a crotch gun to fire at Machete, but he outdrives her. Defeated, she and her girls walk away.The wall of the border is too big for Machete to drive through, so Mendez informs him of a wall with graffiti to drive through. It opens to a tunnel and that allows them to burst underground into the U.S. Waiting for them on the other side is Doakes and Clebourne. Doakes aims his gun to kill the two but Mendez throws a blade of his own to cut off Doakes's hand. He then breaks his neck before shooting Clebourne in the head. Not long after, a group of masked men similar to the ones from before arrive. Among them is Zaror himself. He decapitates Mendez while the other masked men pump Machete full of lead.There's a brief campaign ad to re-elect Rathcock for another term, stating his accomplishments with gun laws and legalizing marijuana in 28 states. He then adds ""Winning was only the beginning.""Machete wakes up in a pool at Voz Tech Industries. Next to him is Mendez's headless corpse. Standing over Machete is Luther Voz (Mel Gibson), president of Voz Tech and the same man who gave Mendez the missile. Voz holds a jar containing Mendez's still-beating heart while the missile's launch countdown is still going. He tells Machete he is lying in a healing pool, and then takes him on a tour of the place in his ""Star Wars""-inspired vehicle. Voz explains that he has seen the future where the world has come to an end, so he has built a rocket that will take him and anybody willing to join him up into space. Additionally, he has been manufacturing genetically engineered super soldiers, and unleashes a number of Zaror clones to fight Machete. Machete grabs any weapon that's close to him and he kills all the clones. Voz is impressed before discussing the final part of his plan - including Mendez, he has manipulated people in other countries, including North Korea and Russia, into obtaining missiles to launch all around the world. Machete runs out of there with one of Voz's weapons and hops in the ""Star Wars"" car. He is followed by Voz's men all the way to an electric fence. The weapon he grabbed is a molecule disabler, which he fires at the goons, causing them to disintegrate. A helicopter arrives, and Machete uses a hook to latch onto the blades to swing around and decapitate the remaining henchmen. He gets into the helicopter which is being flown by Luz.Luz takes Machete back to her hideout with her group, the Network, and tells him that many Mexican laborers have been abducted mysteriously. He tells her about the missile, and she says she knows someone who can disarm it, but he's not gonna like who it is. It's Osiris (Tom Savini), the hitman from the previous film who killed Machete's friend Padre (Cheech Marin). Osiris asks for a chance to redeem himself, remorseful for killing Padre. Machete is then contacted by Miss S.A. who asks him to meet her at a rendezvous point after she's done with her swimsuit competition. Luz knows that Machete had sex with Miss S.A. and says his judgment is clouded.Machete meets Miss S.A. at the rendezvous point with Luz, Osiris, and another guy named Tito following close by. Miss S.A. betrays Machete by saying she offered to bring him back to Voz in exchange for winning the competition to crown her Miss Texas. A gunfight ensues between Voz's goons and Machete's friends. Tito is killed and Machete hops onto the villains' car until one of them shoots him off the roof.Machete wakes up in the desert and walks until a truck driver (Antonio Banderas) stops to pick him up. His Spanish is noticeably awkward and inconsistent, so he gives up and reveals that he is El Camaleon. In his female disguise, he was able to hail the truck's previous driver before assuming another disguise. He takes Machete out of the truck and makes him dig his own grave, but Machete digs up a tunnel where several Mexicans are sneaking past the border. Machete hops in while El Camaleon has his back turned, and he follows soon after he realizes Machete's gone. Unfortunately for him, he runs into a group of border-patrolling rednecks who shoot him to death. Meanwhile, Machete makes it out. He is picked up by Luz's allies and taken back to her hideout. She addresses all of them on Voz's plan to launch his missile and rounds everybody up to help her and Machete fight back.Just barely half an hour is left before the missile launches. Machete, Luz, and the Network infiltrate a party thrown at Voz Tech Industries by disguising themselves as the help. Voz is set to bring all the guests with him into space, complete with their own weird futuristic wardrobe. Machete comes in and tells the crowd that Voz plans to bring the world to an end, prompting the Network and Voz's henchmen to engage in another gunfight. Machete runs after Voz while Miss S.A. shoots out Luz's other eye and kills other Network members.Machete and Osiris find the heart, which Osiris finds too complicated to disarm. Voz enters and shoots the heart, leaving only five minutes left before the launch. He aims his molecule disabler at Machete, but Osiris jumps in and takes the shot to finally redeem himself. Machete comes across a luchador mask, and realizes that Voz was the one who killed Sartana. Voz admits that since Machete got involved, his future visions have become less accurate and clouded. Machete and Voz engage in a duel with their own bladed weapons. Voz gains the upper hand and nearly kills Machete, until Machete uses his hook to pull a flamethrower to spit fire in Voz's face, leaving him horribly disfigured. He stumbles into another room to grab the silver mask seen at the beginning in the fake trailer. At the same time, Luz, now blind, fights Miss S.A. She throws her crown at Luz, but she catches it and throws it back at Miss S.A.'s chest, hitting her heart. Luz finishes her off with a blast to the head.As Machete runs to turn off the missile, Voz succeeds in rounding up the party guests and the Network to bring them with him and the other abducted laborers into his rocket. He also has Luz frozen in carbonite (just as she flips him off). The missile launches with Machete riding it. He cuts the blue wire inside, and the missile falls into a river just as Voz's rocket launches into space. President Rathcock and his men find Machete, and he thanks him for saving the world. He asks where Voz is, and Machete points to the sky. Rathcock says he has a new mission for Machete to go into space to get Voz, and before he says anymore, Machete immediately accepts the mission.In the final shot, Machete goes to the Space X station in an astronaut suit and boards the rocket that will take him up to find Voz and defeat him once and for all, setting the stage for ""Machete Kills Again...In Space!"" It's also shown that Desdemona and her girls will face off with Machete yet again, leading to a cliffhanger where the masked Voz holds a blade at Luz's neck in front of Machete, swinging the blade before cutting to Rathcock saying he approves this message.After the credits:There's an outtake with Michelle Rodriguez ""pussy-punching"" Amber Heard, which Heard laughs about, followed by President Rathcock in space, firing his own badass space guns."
Bad Words,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2170299/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A spelling bee loser sets out to exact revenge by finding a loophole and attempting to win as an adult. An adult, who has been a school dropout, finds a loophole in the regulations and participates in the largest spelling bee in the USA, The Golden Quill. His aim is to take revenge for something done to him in the past.—Sophia Canoni Thanks to finding several loopholes that he is able to exploit, 40 year old middle school dropout Guy Trilby is participating in the international Golden Quill spelling bee. For the first time ever, the Bee is being broadcast live on public broadcast TV. While the parents of the Bee are fuming at the management for allowing this to happen, Guy is committing mischief with lots of the contestants while befriending an Indian kid named Chaitanya who is also rising to the top of the Bee. With $50K at stake, and the Bee administration doing their best to shut down Guy, who will ultimately rise to the top and become King Bee? Also, why is Guy doing this?—halo1k Forty year old Guy Trilby, an angry man, dropped out of school when he was in the eighth grade. It is largely because of this fact that he is able to find a loophole to compete in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee - open to anyone who has not yet completed the eighth grade by the time of the national finals - he winning his regional bee to be one of the fifty national finalists. He also meets one of the other regulations of being sponsored by a national media organization, his sponsor being the one woman online outlet The Click and Scroll, the woman being Jenny Widgeon. Jenny's purpose in sponsoring Guy is to get an exclusive to his story, namely why he feels so inclined to compete in a spelling bee populated primarily by people one-quarter his age, in the process he knowingly making a mockery of the event of which he is well aware. He, so far, has been relatively mum to her about that issue, he and Jenny connecting more on a purely animalistic sense. While the regional organizers tried to find any reason for Guy not to be eligible, those at the national level - bee organizer Dr. Bernice Deagan, and the company owner Dr. William Bowman - are a bit more cutthroat in their dealings with him. Deagan makes it clear to him that she plans on making his life a living hell as long as he proceeds, while Bowman is a little more private in his threats. Guy is also clear that he plans on winning - he having the spelling skills to make a more than credible run - but a little less open about some of the psychological means he will go to to outwit his competitors. He, however, does not count on the tenacity of ten year old competitor Chaitanya Chopra, a seemingly friendless boy who wants to be Guy's friend. Guy's relationship with Chaitanya may be the biggest factor in what Guy decides to do in his quest to the top of the podium.—Huggo Forty-year-old Guy Trilby discovers a loophole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee which stipulates that participants must have not graduated from the eighth grade, allowing him to enter since he dropped out of middle school. He attends and wins a regional spelling bee, and progresses to the national competition after confrontations with both the parents of children and the spelling bee hosts. He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon, a relatively unknown journalist hoping to make a story out of his participation in the bee. On the flight to the national spelling bee, Guy meets Chaitanya Chopra, a 10-year-old entrant in the bee who persistently attempts to befriend Guy. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Guy meets the director of the spelling bee, Dr. Bernice Deagan, who expresses anger at his participation in the bee and places him and his reporter in a cheap hotel. Guy learns that Chaitanya is staying in the same hotel, and takes him out one night to expose Chaitanya to the wilder side of life: stealing food, drinking, and hiring a prostitute to briefly ""flash"" Chaitanya.. The top of a large trophy depicts a bumble bee triumphantly holding up a torch overlooks an auditorium alive with activity. Parents and their children undergoing last minute preparations for the Big Day: The 15h Annual Regional Spelling Bee in Columbus, Ohio. Students practicing words, parents fixing their childrens collars or giving last minute pep talks all being watched by Guy Trilby (Jason Bateman) as he stands by the complementary food table listening to classical music. A parent lumbers over and asks Guy which child hes there to support but Guy tells him that he's not here to support anyone. Confused, the parent asks Guy if hes the Host of the Spelling Bee. Guy claims he's the Winner and gets on stage with the children. A heavy set child asks Guy why hes on the stage and Guy callously replies its because the boys chair was screaming for help. Help. He's so heavy. Help. Before the competition can begin, the elderly host comments that the seats are only for competitorsOutside the school, Guy is told his is ineligible to compete by the Principal but Guy fires back that the rules only state that the participates must not have graduated the 8th grade by the date of the Spelling Bee which he hasn't. The Principal points out that Guy also needs to be sponsored by a Nationally recognized media service enter Guys sponsor, Jenny Widgeon (Katheryn Hahn), a writer for the online paper The Click and Scroll. Jenny threatens to file a law suit to prevent the competition of continuing without Guys participation. The Principal expresses his disgust but allows Guy to participate.Guy 40, single and employed as a proof-reader of manufacturer warranties explains that a few weeks ago he stepped away from his routine in order to do this whole thing because his feelings were hurt. And maybe, as he bursts out of the school with the trophy in hand and a mob of parents in hot pursuit, he didn't think this through. He slides across the front of Jenny's car and the pair drive away as the parents assault the car.Jenny puts down the in-flight meal tray of Guy's seat and places a tape recorder. They're on route to the National Spelling Bee competition and Jenny reminds them of their arrangement: Guy has to answer one question for every round of the tournament he advances through in exchange for her sponsorship. Guy sarcastically rolls his eyes but Jenny, unhappy with the paltry answers shes been given thus far, wants to know: why is Guy so hell bent in pissing off parents and crushing the dreams of children by entering this competition? He doesn't answer and, frustrated, Jenny storms off to the bathroom.Jenny's barely gone when a small Indian boy in the seat in front turns around to stare at Guy. The little boy introduces himself as Chaitainya (Rohan Chand) and happily exclaims that he's also a participant in the National Spelling Bee. Guy disinterested tells ""Chai"" (his nickname) to point his little curry hole towards the front of plane or hell tell the stewardesses that he heard Chai's back ticking. Chai laughs before (unprompted) explaining that his parents are in first class but made him sit in economy because it builds character. Undeterred by Guys disinterest, Chai asks what Guys winning word was. Guy claims he cant remember before sarcastically confessing auto-fellatio. Chai is confused, unfamiliar with the word, and asks for the origin. Guy: Loneliness and the lady who just went to the bathroom can tell you all about that.Guy and Jenny arrive at the office of Bernice Deagan (Allison Janney), the Director of the National Spelling Bee. Deagan expresses her disgust at Guy's antics pointing out that his presence is a disgrace that she has not witnessed in the twenty years in which she has been in charge of the event. She claims that to get where she is, she worked hard and with integrity. Guy points out that she doesn't know him or why he's here but deflects when she demands an answer. She tells him he's in the wrong place to work out his childhood traumas but Guy simply replies that he'll be out of her hair in three days when he wins. She presents Guy with his accommodations and hands him his participation ID expressing the regret of Dr. Bowman for not being there to wrap the lanyard around Guy's throat. Guy asks if Dr. Bowman is too busy doing something more pleasurable to another man's throat but Deagan responds that Dr. Bowman is in the middle of a media training seminar because its the first year the National Spelling Bee will be televised nationally. Guy feigns shock and heads to his hotel.Guy reflects on the fact that he had every opportunity to stop what he was doing to quit and not turn this into a big deal but confesses that it would have taken the lessons that hed never been taught growing up. At the hotel, children walk around with their parents. Guy snags his room key and heads to the elevator. The doors start to close when Chai, luggage in hand, races through just making it in as the doors shut. He excitedly points out that they're both on floor too but Guy shrugs him off. No time for Shwarma. Chai continues to pester Guy asking for Guys favorite word until Guy is forced to say shut the fuck up and walks away, yelling at him all the way to his room the hotels storage closet.The receptionist tells Guy that his accommodations are special and that the hotel is completely booked out. I don't have a bathroom, Guy complains. Yea. His reputation precedes him it seems. Guy calmly asks where he should put his piss and shit but receives no response instead, he heads off to the bar. Jenny joins him and laughs that Deagan is sending him a message. Jenny asks about Guys parents but Guy tells her to screw off so he can drink in peace. Jenny takes his choice of words to mean that Guy would like to have sex with her. Again. Guy looks at her, amused, and says first of all, you're welcome. He asks if screwing off sounds good and tells her all she has to do is ask nicely.The two have sex in Guy's storage closet of a room. As he thrusts, Jenny keeps repeating ""Don't Look At Me!"" Guy tries to screw her without looking at her but accidentally makes eye contact illiciting another scream of ""DON'T LOOK AT ME."" They finish up and Jenny dresses in a hurry, clearly regretting the entire encounter. After she leaves, Guy notices her panties lie crumpled in a corner of the room. He picks them up and slips them in his pocket when there's a knock at the door. Guy comments that Jenny should take better care to grab her panties before she leaves when he looks down and realizes its Chai.Chai asks Guy if Guy can open a jar of minibar pretzels. Guy takes the jar and closes the door on Chai opening up a few minutes later with the open jar and asking about Chai's parents. Chai tells him that his parents are staying in another hotel and that he studied so hard he missed room service. Guy brushes past Chai and goes straight for the minibar. Chai introduces Guy to his friend Todd Chai's book of words and their origins that he studies from nightly. Guy thinks that makes sense, grabs some booze and starts drinking. Chai asks if Fuck is Guy's favorite word and Guy tells him that it's up there. Guy pushes Chai to swear and doesn't stop until Chai says motherfucker. Guy calls him a weirdo and continues drinking.Chai wakes up Guy who passed out Chai's chair. He leaves the room a minute before Chai's father leaves the elevator and meets up with Jenny. They walk and talk on their way to the competition and Guy is about to return her panties when she explains he's been placed next to an expert speller: the child of two previous winners. As they pass the receptionist's desk, Guy plops a plastic bag on the desk for the woman: a plastic bag full of his shit.Deagan hands the randomized list of words for the round to the MC and angrily tells him that this year he should properly enunciate the words. Guy finds his seat among the children as a reporter introduces Dr. Bill Bowman (Philip Baker Hall) the President of the Golden Quill National Spelling Bee. As the first competitor goes up, Guy introduces himself to the boy sitting next to him but the boy responds that his father told him not to talk to the unemployed bum trying to take the money I deserve. Guy processes this before saying that he understands why his father is angry and hands the boy Jenny's panties. ""Can you do me a favor and return these to your mother? She left these in my room last night. I'd do it myself but your father's here and I don't want to tip the nest. Good luck with that divorce though, they can be quite messy.""The host calls the boy up to the podium, still holding Jenny's panties and processing what Guy said about his mother. Glancing over at his parents, he struggles with his word and misspells it eliminating him from the competition. He storms off the stage and shoves the panties into his mothers handas Jenny watches, cringing at how her panties were used by Guy.Guy is called up for his word, which he spells correctly. As the reporter and Dr. Bowman discuss the situation, Dr. Bowman exclaims that they are currently going through the process of plugging up the loop holes so that no more stunts like this can ever occur. In Deagan's office, a host of angry parents ridicule her for allowing Guy to participate in the competition. She assures them that if Guy makes it to the finals she will step down as director immediately.Back at the hotel, Guy downs nips from the minibar. Jenny offhandedly asks Guy what the grammatical significance of Why run from fire ants? Guy thinks and points out that every vowel is there in order backwards. She asks if there are any words in the English language that have every vowel in order and Guy immediately responds with facetious. Jenny tells Guy that those questions were from a test that is given to children who could potentially be geniuses which his eighth grade assessments confirmed before he dropped out. Guy flips through the papers but tosses them aside; disinterested. He points out that his father was never around as a kid so he never had guidance or direction. Jenny asks who his father is since it could be a genetic gift and Guy confirms it didn't come from his mother a woman who hated education so much that when he entered, ironically enough, his first spelling bee she burned his favorite dictionary. Jenny asks if that is why Guy is here, to get back at his dead mother. He responds that she has bigger issues since she needs to be blindfolded to get off during sex. She swears she wont let him near her vagina even if she were offered a million dollars but a few moments later shes giving him a rim job in the shower. Guy laughs: ""I get it now. Don't look at me.""Guy leaves her room and sees Chai sitting on the floor outside his room. He asks the boy if he got locked out of his own room but Chai was just waiting to see if Guy would like to get dinner. Guy agrees and they go to the hotel restaurant. Chai happily exclaims that he enjoys the competition and doesn't care about winning; just having fun. Before Guy can respond one of the competitors mothers (Rachel Harris) comes up to them and tells Guy he is an insult to everyone who worked hard to get to the competition calling him nothing more than an asshole. Guy tells her that Chai is a child and that he doesn't speak like that in front of the boy but that she can take her potty mouth, locate her preteen cocksucker son, shove him up that old blown out sock of a vagina, and go back to whatever shit kicking town you came from. He continues to insult her vagina and then tells her Good night. He tells Chai they should go have some fun.The pair kick off the night by running into a supermarket and stealing a live lobster. They proceed to run around town, hitting up several bars and performing pranks on locals before doing donuts in a nearby parking lot with Jenny's rental car. After, they wash their hands in a nearby bathroom when a businessman enters, texting on his blackberry. Guy and Chai stifle giggles as the man goes into a stall. A few moments pass before the man stumbles out with his pants around his ankles and the lobsters claw around his junk.At a local dive bar, Jenny meets with a former boyfriend, a Bureau employee, and gets a background check on Guy Trilby. The ex-boyfriend makes awkward advances while she reads the papers realizing why Guy is in the National Spelling Bee in the first place.Guy takes Chai out to get chilidogs and milk shakes. Chai says that he's happy they are friends and Guy laughs. He tells Chai that he's always been a loner and when he was little his mother would always take him along, avoiding paying rent, so he never ended up with a lot of friends. He tells Chai that even if Chai never makes any more friends, he'll be fine just like Guy. Chai gives Guy a toy car he stole from the Super Market when they stole the lobster, pointing out that: ""toys aren't fun to play with if you don't have friends to share them with."" Guy repays Chai's kindness by hiring a hooker to show Chai her tits. They return to the hotel and when Chai enters his room, his father is waiting.On the bus to the competition the next morning, Jenny asks if they can make time after today's round to talk not mentioning the background check. In her office, Deagan alters the days list so that Guy is given an extraordinarily hard word, and once again insults the host by telling him that he should speak English when he reads the words.Guy tells the girl he is now sitting next to that she might have dropped a hair clip on the ground when she stands up to check, he rips open a ketchup packet and pours it out on the girls chair. She complains that she couldn't see it but Guy tells her not to mind its time to celebrate: shes now a woman. The girl doesn't understand what hes saying but Guy tells her that she had her period all over the back of her pants. She gets nervous about the situation and, as the host calls her name several times, she runs out of the auditorium in embarrassment. Guy is called up to the podium after and the host pauses, horrified at the word he must now read out loud: Floccinaucinihilipilification. Guy asks him to repeat it, processing the word before slowly spelling it correctly! He smiles at Deagan and returns to his seat.The number of competitors dwindles until Guy and Chai are among the finalists. The angry mob returns to Deagan's office demanding her head (or just her resignation). She refuses until the host arrives with the tampered USB flash drive and points out she unfairly manipulated the competition so that Guy would get the hardest words: a violation of the conditions of the National Spelling Bee. The parents are horrified that Guy is still in the competition despite these measures having been taken. The host smirks at Deagan and tells her that while Guy may be an unlikeable asshole, he still deserves a fair chance. ""You're done"", he says. ""Did I enunciate that correctly?""Guy returns to the hotel and receives a message from the receptionist. He is surprised to see it is from Dr. Bowman. Meeting by a duck pond, Dr. Bowman confesses that, when he was younger, he had a wild time often coming to the precipice of making life altering mistakes. Each time, with no guidance of his own, he was able to turn around and walk away from those mistakes to make something of himself. He tells Guy that he's approaching an abyss of his own and assures him that if he continues further in the competition he will not be able to live with what he did to all those children. Guy retorts that it's a nice threat, but Dr. Bowman simply says Losers lose, Mr. Trilby. Dr. Bowman walks away after confirming that he thinks Guy is nothing more than a loser but Guy tells him that he's not going to lose.Swinging by a gas station to pick up a few Playboys for Chai, Guy walks up to his room when Jenny arrives eager to talk about her discovery. He brushes past her, all he wants to do is give the kid his porn and ice cream and then go to sleep. Jenny gets upset that Guy can't even fake interest in talking despite the way their relationship has been going. She calls him a prick and leaves him on his own.As he reaches Chai's room, he sees the door ajar and talking from within. Chai's father reminds Chai that while Chai must keep Guy close for the competitive advantage, he must not get too close as Guy is still the enemy and that he should keep Guy close so that Guy wont be able to bring himself to beat Chai when the time comes. Chai says he knows the plan when Guy bursts in, angry. Guy reveals he heard everything and tells Chai that he makes him sick. Chai insists that they're really friends but Guy calls him a liar. But Guy, we ARE friends you showed me my first boobs! Chai's father is instantly confused but Guy reiterates that Chai is a liar. Guy tosses the toy car onto the floor and stomps it before storming out.Later that evening, the receptionist calls Chai's room to tell him that his father will pick him up in the lobby to take him out for ice cream. Chair leaves the room and, as he does, Guy sneaks in. Chai arrives at the lobby and waits, confused, before returning to the room and finding Todd his spelling binder missing. Noticing a bright orange light in the window, Chai draws closer pulling apart the shades to reveal Guy in the courtyard: burning Todd and giving Chai the finger. Chai bursts into tears of anguish at the sight of his notebook on fire.A few hours later, when hes sure Guy is asleep, Chai calls the police to report that Guy has abducted and possibly raped a young woman. He watches as two police officers burst into Guys room and drag him out violently.Jenny gets Guy out of jail and insists that they talk about what shes found. She confesses that she knows his father is Dr. Bowman and Guy congratulates her she's a better reporter than he thought. Guy tells her that his mother told him on her deathbed who his father was and how to find him. Bowman had been a traveling encyclopedia salesman and his mother was a waitress; after a one night stand, she got pregnant, told Bowman and Bowman took off. Pissed at Bowman and angry at the loss of his mother, Guy decided to embarrass Bowman and his precious spelling competition. Jenny asks Guy if Bowman knows who Guy is. Not a clue. But he will once its over.The finals get underway speller after speller is eliminated. When Guy is called up his word is slubberdegullion. Before he can start spelling, the mother he insulted at the hotel restaurant calls out Perfect, I know what that means a dirty, wretched slob just like you. The host turns towards her and says that if she keeps talking, she will be asked to leave. Outraged, she screams that the host should ask Guy to leave security offers come and escort her from the room as her outburst escalates into profanities on national television. The entire crowd begins chanting Kick him out, kick him out over and over forcing Bowman to take the mic and tell them that they are on national television and should show the competition the respect it deserves that he deserves. He tosses the mic to the floor and Guy responds in kind by spelling the word correctly and taking his seat.The third to last speller is eliminated and now its just Guy and Chai. Guy is called up first and given his word: Parisology. Guy looks out at the crowd, taking them in. He spells slowly and deliberately looking right at Bowman as he purposely misspells the word. Everyone begins clapping in excitement but the Host interrupts to remind them: because its the final two, Guy will stay on stage until Chai spells his word correctly if Chai messes up his word, Guy will get another chance to win. Guy sits down and tells Chai hes done but Chai insists that they are still friends and misspells his word to prove it.Guy is dumbfounded and gets up to the mic, misspells his word again and tells Chai that its his game to win. Chai refuses telling Guy that if this is the only way to prove they are friends then its what hell do. Guy tells him to stop wasting his time turning to Chai's parents in the audience to complement them on what a lying piece of shit their son is. He goes up to take the mic and misspell his next word when Chai gets up and growls I did not lie! kicking Guy straight in the balls. The collective audience gasps in surprise. Guy breathes in you can add violent to the list. Gandhi would be proud. Dr. Bowman rushes to the stage as Chai picks up a chair and declares I was born in Cleveland, Ohio! swinging for Guy but knocking Dr. Bowman off the stage instead.A commercial interruption. Public access tv messages float by as the Host, officials and Dr. Bowman decide on how to proceed.Dr. Bowman addresses the audience because the contestants behavior was equally egregious, neither will be disqualified. They will each be given 1 more round of words and the winner will then be decided. Chai goes up first and his father stands up, begging the boy not to embarrass him or his mother any further. Guy realizes that if he doesn't think fast, this could drag on further. When the host reads out Chai's word, Guy immediately says Come on kid, easiest word in the world and misspells it. Chai retorts that Guy missed a letter, and spells it correctly. Dr. Bowman laughs triumphant BOTH contestants can now be disqualified on the grounds of cheating. But the host quickly points out that because Guy was purposefully misspelling the word and Chai corrected him, Chai wasn't receiving help and STILL spelled the word correctly. Bowman declares Chai the winner and Guy walks off the stage and towards the exit of the auditorium. As he leaves Chai insists that he wants to split the winnings with Guy because they're friends, but Guy smiles and gives the kid the finger and leaves.In his hotel room, Guy sees the supply list hanging on the wall and decides to write down his story in a letter for Bowman - explaining who he is, how he got there and why he did what he did (bookending the narration of the film). He and Jenny check out, smiling having patched up their differences. On the way out of the hotel, he passes Dr. Bowman and hands Bowman the letter but Bowman rips it in two. What could you have to write that I would be interested in reading? Guy frowns and responds: The bit about me being your son. He takes Jennys hand and walks away. As he leaves, Bowman stoops down to pick up the letter.On a plane home, Bowman has the taped letter in his hand and reads it over the last line explaining that the note wasn't about blame, it was just an explanation and a request for understanding. Guy signs off Yours, literally Guy Trilby.Sometime later, Chai leaves school and a pair of bullies knock his stuff to the floor. As they cycle away, an unmarked Crowne Victoria pulls up in front of the school with Guy in the drivers seat. Chai asks how Guy got the car and Guy tells him that he won it at a police auction with his half of the winnings. He offers the kid a ride and puts a siren on the roof. Together, they drive after the bullies on their bikes cheering as they do it.The End."

With her roommate Kaycee (Sky Ferreira), they sit through a lecture on the cruel traditions placed on women in African tribes, which horrifies Justine. Later, the two notice a group of janitors sitting for a hunger strike in order to obtain health insurance. The girls think these types of groups are stupid.After classes, Justine is invited by another student, named Jonah (Aaron Burns), to check out an activist group led by Alejandro (Ariel Levy). His cause is for the tribe in the Peruvian jungle. Justine makes a comment about the group starving themselves through the jungle for their cause, which Alejandro takes offense to. He orders Justine to leave.A few days later, Justine approaches Alejandro to apologize and decides she wants to join the cause. Another few days later, the two of them, plus a full group of activists, including Jonah, Alejandro's girlfriend Kara (Ignacia Allamand), Amy (Kirby Bliss Blanton), Amy's girlfriend Samantha (Magda Apanowicz), Lars (Daryl Sabara), and Daniel (Nicolas Martinez) head off on a flight, partially funded by Justine's dad, to Peru. Because the plane is small, it makes Amy anxious.Once the group arrives in Peru, they take a boat through the jungle toward their destination. They stop so Justine and Lars can use the bathroom. Lars almost gets his penis bitten by a tarantula and he runs back to the boat.When the group finds the bulldozers, they set off an explosive to stop their acts. As Alejandro recording the militia in their act against the jungle, one of the men holds Justine at gunpoint. Alejandro gets it on video to show off to the internet what kind of actions these people are willing to take against others, all while Justine cries. The man takes the gun away, and he and his men arrest the group.The group is being sent home in their plane. They celebrate their victory while Justine is traumatized from the incident and angry that the others were ready to let her get shot for their cause. Jonah announces that their video has been blowing up all over social media. All of a sudden, the plane's engine blows out, causing the pilots to lose control and head for a crash landing. The plane comes apart, sending at least two other people flying out. The plane crashes, killing both pilots. The man that flew out got impaled and the woman that fell out landed in a tree, badly injured and nearly dying. The rest of the group tries to move somewhere safe until they see some of the villagers in the forest. Kara asks them for help, but she gets an arrow in her neck. The others make a run for it, but they get hit by tranquilizing darts by unseen natives. Alejandro tries to remove the arrow out of Kara's neck, only for her to get another one in her head.When the group wakes up, they are being taken across the river by a Cannibal Headhunter, to the village where the rest of the tribe resides. They're all put in wooden cages, except for Jonah. He gets fed some kind of liquid before being laid down and having his limbs held down by some villagers. The Village Elder (Antonieta Pari) walks over to Jonah and holds a spike over his face. She digs the spike into his right eye and gouges it out before eating it in front of the villagers and Jonah's friends. The Elder proceeds to take his other eye, his tongue, and then has Jonah's limbs hacked off before he is finally decapitated. The others are horrified and cover their eyes.Jonah's remains are later cooked and soon eaten by the rest of the villagers. Alejandro determines that the villagers think they are the enemy. Lars mentions he can smell Jonah being cooked, making Amy sick. She first throws up and then has a massive bowel movement in the cage, which makes the others sick while the village children laugh and mock Amy.Justine tries to appease one of the children by playing her flute necklace that belonged to her mother. The child likes the music, but the Cannibal Headhunter and other native warriors arrive and pull Justine, Amy, and Samantha out of the cages. They take the ladies's panties off and the Elder takes a spike similar to what she used on Jonah. She puts it up Amy and Samantha's vaginas, then up Justine's. The Elder breaks Justine's hymen, proving to the tribe that she is a virgin. They take Justine into a hut and cover her in some kind of white powder before returning her to the cage.The next day, Alejandro mentions that the whole trip was just a PR stunt and that he doesn't actually give a shit about the tribe or the cause. He makes a crude comment on how it's good that Jonah was eaten first since he'd feed the tribe for a week, angering Daniel and Justine.Any attempt at escaping the cages leads to the group getting shot with darts by the watchers. They create a distraction that allows Samantha to climb out and look for help. Hours later, the villagers bring the group bowls with liquid and meat scraps. Amy drinks from the bowl and sees a bio-hazard symbol, which she recognizes as one of Samantha's tattoos. Then she sees the children wearing patches of flesh with the rest of Samantha's tattoos. Amy then smashes the bowl and slits her throat with a jagged piece.Knowing the villagers will get Amy next, Lars and Daniel stuff a bag of weed down her throat. the village Headhunter enters the cage and hacks Amy's corpse to pieces. After she is cooked and consumed, the villagers all get stoned. This allows Justine and Daniel to escape from their cage. Lars tries to follow but the cynical Alejandro gets him with a dart so he doesn't die alone.When Lars awakens, he sees two villagers sitting over him with the giggles. He tries to appease them with silly hand gestures until they start to get the munchies. One villager bites into Lars's arm, but he shoves him away and runs for it. Unfortunately, a large group of villagers attacks him and eats him alive.Justine and Daniel manage to get to a river and find some wreckage of the plane. Justine falls into the water and gets swept downriver. When Justine grabs a rock to hold onto, Daniel manages to rescue her by extending a tree branch and brings her ashore. That evening, they follow the trail of wreckage and finally arrive at the crash site of their plane. They find their GPS, but the battery's dead. They then hear a ringtone coming from the pocket of Kara, whose corpse is hung up alongside the other dead activists. Justine gets Kara's phone out of her pocket, but the villagers show up and dart her and Daniel.Justine awakens the next morning back in the village to find the medicine woman covering her nude body in white powder and paint. She is trying to sew Justine's vagina shut as part of a customary ritual. Daniel is tied up to a pole and covered from head to toe in a green mold by the village Headhunter. A colony of big ants start climbing up his body and biting into him. Before anything else happens to Justine, a child runs and brings the villagers the severed head of a man wearing a hard hat. The other villagers run out to see what other remains are available for consumption. The child that Justine played the flute necklace for shows up and unties Justine's hands. She unties her feet before the medicine woman returns. When she gets a good opportunity, she blows a special powder into the medicine woman's face and rips the bone out of her nose, allowing her to run. She tries to get Daniel, but he's in so much pain that he prefers to die. The child blows the powder in Daniel's face to make him pass out before he cuts Daniel's throat.The child leads Justine deep into the forest to escape. Alejandro begs Justine to save him, but she leaves him to the villagers. She lets the child keep the flute necklace and thanks him for helping her. Justine then runs and finds the militia shooting and killing the villagers. Justine finds the village Headhunter laying in the grass after being shot. With the local mercenaries approaching, Justine holds her hands up and states that she's American. She takes out Kara's phone and pretends to record the mercs in their acts before smashing the phone. The leader orders his men to take Justine away. She is boarded on a chopper to fly home, where she sees the bodies of the villagers sprawled everywhere and the soldiers burning the huts.Upon returning home, Justine testifies as the sole survivor from the crash. She denies witnessing any cannibalism.Justine then dreams that Alejandro made it home, and that she has monster teeth that she uses to rip out his throat. When she wakes up, she looks out her window and sees activists outside protesting for Alejandro to be returned home.During the closing credits, we hear a phone call between Justine and a woman claiming to be Alejandro's sister. She mentions seeing a surveillance photo (which we see) of Alejandro still in the jungle. His sister tells Justine that they need to talk."

All Is Lost,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2017038/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a collision with a shipping container at sea, a resourceful sailor finds himself, despite all efforts to the contrary, staring his mortality in the face. Deep into a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean, an unnamed man (Redford) wakes to find his 39-foot yacht taking on water after a collision with a shipping container left floating on the high seas. With his navigation equipment and radio disabled, the man sails unknowingly into the path of a violent storm. Despite his success in patching the breached hull, his mariner's intuition and a strength that belies his age, the man barely survives the tempest. Using only a sextant and nautical maps to chart his progress, he is forced to rely on ocean currents to carry him into a shipping lane in hopes of hailing a passing vessel. But with the sun unrelenting, sharks circling and his meager supplies dwindling, the ever-resourceful sailor soon finds himself staring his mortality in the face.—Roadside Attractions A man is sailing alone on his sailboat in the Indian Ocean. He wakes up one morning to find that a wayward shipping container which had been adrift has rammed into his boat, gashing a hole in the boat's side, which has allowed water to pour into the boat's cabin. He is eventually able to fix the hole, but he ends up learning that the damage to the boat is more than superficial as many of the electrical and communication systems are no longer working. These issues in combination have placed him into a precarious situation, as he doesn't know his exact location, and he cannot communicate with anyone. When he hits a storm, his situation worsens, where he eventually can only drift. He has to hope that he encounters no other storms while his rations diminish, and he drifts toward what he hopes is the region's shipping lane where there is a greater chance that he will be spotted by passing ships and thus be rescued.—Huggo A man is sailing alone in his yacht but during the night, his vessel collides with a container adrift on the sea while he sleeps. The yacht is flooded and she loses her navigation and communication equipment and heads to a violent storm. When the yacht sinks, the sailor embarks in the liferaft that is carried adrift by the currents to a shipping lane. His fight for survival begins.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil We first meet the unnamed protagonist -- a sailor floating on the ocean waves, sans hope, minutes from death. On the soundtrack, our hero reads a final missive to the world; he expresses remorse to his loved ones for hurting them, and prepares to enter a watery grave. The picture then jumps back in time by eight days, and an intertitle places us in the Indian Ocean, 1700 nautical miles from the Sunda Straits. The boats-man, lying asleep below deck on his schooner, is suddenly jostled to consciousness by a horrifying crash. He discovers that a steel crate, floating in mid-ocean, has torn a gaping hole into the side of his vessel. From that ominous beginning, the crises mount, including flooding, a ruined ham radio, and blinding thunderstorms. Though the sailor tries everything he can think of to save himself, external challenges ultimately coalesce and threaten to damn him.. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean (""1700 nautical miles from the Sumatra Straits""), we see an abstract image of an object floating in water. Our Man (Robert Redford) narrates:""13th of July, 4:50 p.m. I'm sorry. I know that means little at this point, but I am. I tried. I think you would all agree that I tried. To be true, to be strong, to be kind, to love, to be right, but I wasn't."" And I know you knew this, in each of your ways. And I am sorry. All is lost here, except for soul and body, that is what's left of it, and a half day's ration. It's inexcusable, I know that now. How it could have taken this long to admit that, I'm not sure, but it did. I fought to the end. I'm not sure what that is worth, but know that I did. I've always hoped for more for you all. I will miss you. I'm sorry.""The film cuts to eight days earlier, as Our Man wakes up to find his sailboat, the Virginia Jean, a Cal 39, taking on water. He goes out on deck to see the boat has hit a detached shipping container filled with sneakers, leaving a yard-long hole in his high starboard side. He goes below to get a sea anchor and ties it to the container. The anchor pulls the container free from the sailboat. He steers the boat back to the side of the container and jumps onto the container to go retrieve his sea anchor. He then steers his boat away from the container for good.Our Man checks the electronics on the boat and discovers that they do not work. He retrieves a box filled with fiber glass patch materials and mixes up a batch and starts patching the hole. He uses a knife to carve a piece of wood until it can fit in the manual- hand-bilge pump hole, as he has lost the lever for it. He starts pumping out the water from below deck. That night he sleeps in a hammock, above the water remaining in the boat.The next day he continues patching the hole in the side of the boat and pumping more water. It's slow, exhausting work. He pulls out the radio equipment and pours bottled water on the interior of the devices to remove conductive sea salt from them. He sets them out to dry on deck.The next day, he's able to complete cleaning the cabin with a sponge and mop. His fiber glass patch seems tentative, but at least keeps water out. He drags one of the boat's service battery on deck and hooks it to his radio. The radio does not work. He consults his navigation charts. He goes below and as he's looking through a book on celestial navigation, he hears someone speaking on the radio. He hurries back up on deck and makes an SOS call. It doesn't appear to work before the radio goes dead.Later, he has a couple of stiff drinks and begins fixing a meal. It begins to rain. He goes out on deck and enjoys washing off in a brief rain. He eats a pasta dinner, reads some of a book using a head lamp, and goes to sleep.The next day he hoists himself high up the mast in a bosun's chair, and discovers a disconnected antenna lead. He reattaches the lead but, while at the top of the mast, sees an oncoming tropical storm. He immediately descends to make preparations for it. He packs things away and even takes time to shave.When the storm arrives, he runs before the wind under bare poles for a while, until he determines that approach is too tiresome and dangerous. He returns below deck to put on a rain suit. He intends to bring the boat into a hove-to position and puts on a safety harness and starts crawling to the bow to hoist the storm jib. Suddenly, a large wave hits him and he is thrown overboard. He manages to hang on and pull himself back on board, returning to the cabin where he vomits sea water and briefly collapses.The boat starts to list heavily, then capsizes, rolling completely over. He goes back out on deck and throws the sea anchor out. The boat does another 180 degree roll, knocking him overboard. He makes his way along the mast and gets back on deck just before the boat returns upright. The main mast has snapped and most of the equipment on board is destroyed.He cuts the mast loose, then goes back into the cabin and sees that the fiberglass patch has started leaking again. The boat lurches and he strikes his forehead on the bulkhead and falls unconscious. When he wakes, the cabin has about two feet of water in it, with more gushing in.He grabs the bag containing a life raft and takes it out on deck. After tying the raft to the railing of the sailboat, he tosses it overboard and pulls the rip cord, causing the raft to self inflate. He pulls it close to the boat and jumps on board. He pulls the roof of the raft up and around and zips it closed. He rides out the rest of the storm in darkness.The next day he awakens in the raft, which is tethered to the boat that is now is half-submerged. He pulls on the rope and brings the raft up next to the boat. He climbs onto the boat and looks things over. He lowers himself into the flooded cabin and gathers some canned food, fresh water and a few other items. He is leaving, but remembers something else he wants and pulls the raft back to the boat and goes back into the cabin, diving under the water and retrieving a white cardboard box. He then starts tending the wound to his forehead, until he realizes that the boat is going under. He returns to the raft and watches the Virginia Jean sink.He opens the white cardboard box, which contains a sextant and a card. He tosses the card aside without reading it. He then refers to an instructional manual and tries using the sextant and navigational maps to determine where he is.He wakes after sleeping to find sea water has seeped into his raft. He starts using a rag to mop it up and wring it out over the side.He figures his best hope of being found is to make his way over to the shipping lanes. From his readings, he is heading north by northwest, toward a shipping zone he sees on the map. Another storm moves in. The storm capsizes his raft. He unzips the cover and goes out to pull the raft back upright. Back inside, surrounded by wind, rain, and water, he closes his eyes and covers his ears.The next day he uses a hand pump to re-inflate the raft and continues bailing water out of the raft. He finds that his jug of drinking water has been contaminated by seawater, after which he gets emotional and emits a drawn out, ""Fuuuccck!"" He has a thought and cuts open the water jug and uses a plastic bag to make a freshwater still.Our Man is exposed to the elements, becoming dehydrated and numb. His still works and he gets a little water to drink, savoring it. He maps out that he is in the shipping lane now and he begins looking intently along the horizon. Seeing nothing, he naps. When he wakes, he sees a cargo ship and lights a flare, waving his arms and yelling for help, as the ship passes by very close. It keeps on moving and disappears.The next day, he finally gets a tug on his fishing line, but just as he is about to pull in a fish, a small shark grabs it at the surface. Many sharks are swimming under his raft. That night, he wakes up to find another cargo ship passing closely by, almost right on top of him. This time he fires off two aerial flares, but again, the ship keeps going and disappears.On the eighth day, he charts that he has now moved north out of the shipping lane and back to open ocean. He is also out of food and has very little water and cannot hope to survive much longer. He writes the message that he narrated at the beginning of the movie, puts it in a jar, and with some hesitation, he tosses it into the water.That night, he sees a light in the distance, possibly another ship. He is out of signaling devices, but tears blank pages from his journal and a book to create a signal fire in the empty water jug. As he adds more paper to the fire, he loses control of it and the flames consume his raft. He falls overboard. Treading water, he looks up to the heavens, then stops swimming and lets himself sink, watching the raft burning on the surface above him.As he sinks, he sees the hull of a boat with a search light approaching his burning raft.
Our man swims up to the surface, and a hand reaches down to him."

She wants to break into it and look around. She correctly guesses that Paris is the type to keep her house keys under her welcome mat. Mark starts to panic when he and Rebecca actually enter Paris's mansion, but he becomes distracted when he sees how Paris has decorated her home with pictures of herself.

They break in and explore her shoe closet together, although Mark is the only person who can fit into Pariss large heels. They find a stack of Polaroid pictures of Paris (it's implied they're pornographic), but the real score is a bag of cocaine they find in one of Paris's purses.

Later that night, they go to a party thrown by Chloe and brag to numerous people that they've broken into the homes of multiple celebrities.A news report shows footage from the robberies at Audrina Patridge's home and the home of Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom. Mark and Chloe want to lay off breaking into homes for a while, but Rebecca points out that nothing has happened to them. Mark later confesses that that was the problem: nothing happened after the news report, so they kept breaking into peoples homes. They take Rob to Pariss house with Nicki and Sam, and they also break into the home of Lindsey Lohan. Chloe also takes Mark to Rickys club so that Ricky can help Mark fence his stolen Rolexes. The teens continue to brag about their exploits to many people.

Nicki claims she works at the church but cannot recall the name of the African country where church members go to build wells.As the trial approaches, Nicki tries to find a conservative outfit to wear to court. Sam sits on her bed and watches her dress (Note: the police could not find evidence that put Sam at the scene of the crimes, so Sam has not been charged with anything). On the day of the trial, Nicki tells the cameras she will make a statement. She blames the burglaries on karma and believes people will want to hear her side of events. Her mom, Sam, and Emily accompany her into the courtroom, where the other defendants wait.

Closed Circuit,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2218003/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A high-profile terrorism case unexpectedly binds together two ex-lovers on the defense team - testing the limits of their loyalties and placing their lives in jeopardy. It was a typical morning in London when a powerful bomb exploded in the heart of the city. After the smoke cleared, sole surviving terrorist cell member Farroukh Erdogan (Denis Moschitto) was quickly taken into custody. As preparations for his trial begin, however, the government's plan to use classified evidence to prosecute the suspect leads the Attorney General (Jim Broadbent) to appoint Special Advocate Claudia Simmons-Howe (Hall) to the case. Claudia's unique position as a government-approved defense lawyer ensures that she can review the top-secret evidence, and advocate for full disclosure during the inevitable ""closed"" session portion of the trial. Once Claudia has reviewed the evidence, however, any communication with the defense team and the defendant himself is strictly forbidden. Later, When Erdogan's lawyer dies just before the trial begins, Claudia's driven ex-lover, attorney Martin Rose (Bana), takes his place. Realizing that their previous affair could jeopardize their involvement with the case, Claudia and Martin vow to keep the relationship a well-guarded secret. In time, however, Martin's exhaustive investigation reveals evidence of a shocking conspiracy that threatens to consume them both. Borough market in London can be seen via numerous closed circuit TV cameras, and we can hear snippets of conversations. A large truck is driven to the centre of the market as vendors yell that it cannot park there. It explodes.Scotland Yard raids a storage garage and finds the chemicals that made the bomb. They arrest the owner of the garage in front of his wife and 14 year-old child. He is to be tried in public by one barrister, however a private hearing will be held to determine what government evidence will be permitted to be used. If the evidence will compromise the state's terrorism investigations, it will be withheld from the public hearing.At a funeral for a barrister, we learn that the deceased (Simon) was to represent the terrorist at the upcoming public hearing, but committed suicide. He is being replaced by Martin Rose (Eric Bana). Martin is recently divorced because he was caught having an affair with Claudia Simmons-Howe (Rebecca Hall). They have since broken up.Claudia will be representing the terrorist's interests in the private hearing. The 2 are not to have any contact with each other once the confidential government information is shown to Claudia so as not to compromise the public trial.A reporter from the New York Times arranges for a mutual friend to invite Martin to a party, where she suggests to him that Simon's death may not have been suicide.Martin notices that the same taxi picks him up whenever he hails a cab. He goes over Simon's files, and finds that:The terrorist was arrested in Germany for heroin possession, but was able to emigrate to England without standingtrial.The terrorist drives a swanky Mercedes.He called the person that rented the garage, and drove the truck to the market 27 times in the month prior to the bombing.He buys his heroin uncut - an expensive habitThe terrorist is not cooperating at all in the investigation - not even for his own defence.Simon died when his investigation reached this point.Martin discloses this to the NY Times reporter at a secret meeting, but they both feel others are watching.Martin arranges to meet Claudia secretly at a football match, and tells her his findings. He begs her not to bring this information up at the private trial, hoping to do it himself in public.At the trial, the judge decides to conduct the private hearing first. Claudia questions Melissa, an MI5 witness - who was at the party where Martin met the NY Times reporter. Claudia accuses MI5 of botching a sting operation, and planning a cover-up. Melissa avoids answering the questions. She does state that the secret informant is the terrorist's son. The judge says he will question the boy himself the next day at 10am.Martin is accosted by the Attorney General (Jim Broadbent), who warns him that he should just follow the easy path, and not bring MI5 into the trial. He implies that he was put on the case specifically because he had an affair with Claudia, and if any of her private information shows up in the public case, a mistrial would result on the assumption that they had met after she had seen the confidential government information. The terrorist would be found guilty, and would serve some time before getting out of jail and freed for his service.Walking out of the courthouse, Martin sees a newspaper headline that the reporter he met with has been found dead.Martin hails a cab (this time with a different number). The cab is hit by a truck, but Martin is only injured and goes to the hospital for a short time. He is again warned to back off.Martin warns Claudia that her life is in danger. She is jumped in her apartment, but fights off the attacker. They discover that the boy has escaped from the ""safe"" house where he was being held. From an earlier interview, Claudia believes he is hiding out at his Aunt's house. They head there, elude the shadowy people watching the house, and get the boy to a truly safe place for the night. He has a memory stick with all the information necessary to blame the situation on MI5.The next morning, the 3 are allowed to walk to the courthouse - all the time being watched. As they make their way into the courtroom, 2 people enter the terrorist's cell and strangle him. They rip his bedsheet to make a noose, and rig the cell to look like he has committed suicide.The judge is notified that the defendant is dead. He closes the trial before the boy can give any evidence.3 months later, we hear the opposition ripping strips off the Attorney General, accusing him of orchestrating a cover-up. Apparently word has leaked out about the situation despite all of MI5's efforts."

The Wind Rises,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2013293/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A look at the life of Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed Japanese fighter planes during World War II. Jiro dreams of flying and designing beautiful airplanes, inspired by the famous Italian aeronautical designer Caproni. Nearsighted from a young age and unable to be a pilot, Jiro joins a major Japanese engineering company in 1927 and becomes one of the world's most innovative and accomplished airplane designers. The film chronicles much of his life, depicting key historical events, including the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, the tuberculosis epidemic and Japan's plunge into war. Jiro meets and falls in love with Nahoko, and grows and cherishes his friendship with his colleague Honjo.—Official site An aviation-obsessed engineer named Jirô Horikoshi (Hideaki Anno) has loved the aesthetics, spirit, and science of flight for as long as he can remember. For years he's been designing and building his dream plane, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, and it's finally completed. But Jiro's dreams come crashing down when he learns, to his horror, that his creation will be used for combat in World War II.. In 1918, Jiro Horikoshi is a young Japanese boy growing up with his mother and young sister. Jiro has very poor eyesight (hence his Coke bottle style glasses), which gets in the way of his dream to become a pilot. He spends much of his time reading aviation magazines and fending younger kids off from bullies at school. One night Jiro has a vivid dream of Giovanni Battista Caproni, an Italian aeronautical engineer. Caproni becomes his mentor and friend in following dreams, and Jiro begins to notice that the man loves building planes, but that he frowns upon the use of ""beautiful dreams"" for war or violence.Fast forward about eight years or so, and Jiro is a young adult, on his way by train to university, where he'll study to become an engineer. While riding outdoors, the wind lifts his hat up off his head, where a beautiful young girl catches it. She's there with her maid, and they exchange a friendly greeting with Jiro, but don't give their names. Soon after, the town they're riding through is hit by a brutal earthquake. The girl's maid breaks her ankle and can't walk, so Jiro offers to carry her away from the de-railed train before the ensuing explosion and fire can hurt them. He leaves soon afterwards without giving his name. Through engineering school, Jiro acts somewhat eccentric, eating fish every day just so he can study the curve of the bones and not socializing much. He eventually befriends Honjo, a fellow student. Meanwhile his little sister, Kayo, decides she'd like to go to medical school, training to become a doctor. Jiro receives a package at school wrapped in purple cloth, which he discovers is his slide ruler that he used to brace the broken ankle of the woman he saved during the earthquake, as well as his shirt, which he brought water in. Realizing that it must've been the girl and her maid from the train who dropped it off, he rushes into the street to thank them, but there's no sign of them being there.In 1927, Jiro is hired at the Mitsubishi Corporation to design a more compact, modern and streamlined fighter jet. He has no idea how the planes will eventually be used, but remembering Caproni from his dreams, he dedicates his skills wholeheartedly. His boss, a curmudgeonly dwarf named Kurokawa, at first finds him foolish but soon develops a fondness for him thanks to his intricate airplane designs. Honjo, also employed at the corporation, remains a close friend to Jiro, and together they work on the Falcon, the fighter plane that will supposedly aid them in bring peace by helping in the war effort. Bothered somewhat by the implications of this, Jiro finds himself looking to Caproni for guidance more often. During a test flight, the Falcon breaks apart in mid-air, and Jiro becomes frustrated by Japan's backwards technology, which utilizes mostly wood and canvas instead of metal. Him and Honjo are sent to Germany together to learn about the fellow country's modern technological advancements.Germany seems radically different from the quaint atmosphere of Japan. Jiro and Honjo are amazed by the Junkers G.38, an airplane made entirely from lightweight metal. While at the factory where it's being stored, they're surprised to find that the German guards are incredibly hostile towards them both, however Hugo Junkers, the owner, cheerfully allows them aboard the new plane. Jiro marvels about how many people the plane could hold, and he thinks it could have much better purposes than for use in the war. He dreams again of Caproni, who tells him that the world is a better place because of planes, but that mankind will inevitably use them for sinister purposes if they feel like they can win with them.Jiro and Honjo return to Japan. Jiro begins working with Kurokawa on a new fighter plane, plus he gets promoted to chief designer. Again his designs fail, much to his disappointment. In 1933, he spends his summer at a hotel resort in rural Japan, where he runs into a familiar-looking young lady. While out painting, she loses her umbrella in the wind, but Jiro catches it and returns it to her grateful father. The girl, whose name is Nahoko, turns out to be the girl whose maid was saved by Jiro during the earthquake. Nahoko reveals during a walk through the rain with Jiro that the maid now has two children, and that she cried with joy upon learning what Jiro's real name was during the time that he was in engineering school. Jiro and Nahoko befriend a kindhearted piano player, Mr. Castorp, another guest at the hotel. Castorp, secretly a Soviet spy who fled from Germany, admits to Jiro that he disapproves of the Nazi Regime's cruelty and carelessness, and also warns him that Junkers, the airplane factory owner from Germany, is in grave danger for going against Hitler's views on war and the Holocaust. Soon after, Jiro gets permission to marry Nahoko despite her tuberculosis.Returning to his career, Jiro is told by Kurokawa that the Japanese Secret Service is seeking him out as an enemy of their German allies. Several of Kurokawa's friends have also been arrested, so Jiro goes to live at his boss' house until the suspicion dies down. He writes to Nahoko, and discusses with her how Mr. Castorp was wanted for being a traitor to Germany. He prays their friend has escaped the country safely, knowing what sort of fate would await him if he were caught. Nahoko comes to visit the Kurokawa household, where reluctantly Mr. Kurokawa weds them both in a traditional ceremony. Kayo, now a doctor, visits her brother, but cautions him that the marriage is ill-advised because of Nahoko's likely short life she has left. As Nahoko gets more sick, she still continues to enjoy her time with Jiro, and she and Kayo even become close friends. While Jiro returns to work, finally creating a successful design, Nahoko passes away in a sanitarium.In 1945, Jiro's design for the ""Mitsubishi Zeroes"" is used, but much to his horror, he discovers that the planes are used for suicide missions by Kamikazes. In his dreams, he is haunted by the sight of thousands of the ruined planes being destroyed in fiery explosions, much like Caproni was haunted that his Italian aircraft designs were used for mostly destructive purposes. Caproni reassures him that even though his planes were used for evil, aviation itself is beautiful. Nahoko's spirit also comforts him, telling him to try to live his life to the fullest."
Snowpiercer,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a future where a failed climate change experiment has killed all life except for the survivors who boarded the Snowpiercer (a train that travels around the globe), a new class system emerges. Set in 2031, the entire world is frozen except for those aboard the Snowpiercer. For seventeen years, the world's survivors are on a train hurtling around the globe creating their own economy and class system. Led by Curtis (Chris Evans), a group of lower-class citizens living in squalor at the back of the train are determined to get to the front of the train and spread the wealth around. Each section of the train holds new surprises for the group who have to battle their way through. A revolution is underway.—Anne Campbell The nations release the substance CW-7 with the intention of controlling global warming, but accidentally it results in another Ice Age destroying Earth. The only survivors live in the train Snowpiercer which is driven by a perpetual motion engine created by the millionaire Wilford (Ed Harris) that lives in the engine part. In 2031, after seventeen years, there is a fight of classes inside the train since the oppressed lower class lives in dreadful conditions in the last wagons of the train while the elite lives in the front wagons. The lower class is fed with protein bars only; they are oppressed and punished by Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton) and her brutal guards; and their children are taken every now and then when they reach a certain height. The leaders Gilliam (Sir John Hurt), Curtis Everett (Chris Evans), and Edgar (Jamie Bell) are plotting a scheme to reach the engine and talk to Wilford about their conditions using the addicted security engineer Namgoong Minsoo (Song Kang-ho) and his clairvoyant daughter Yona (Ko Asung) that are imprisoned to open the locked doors. When the son of Tanya (Octavia Spencer), Tim (Marcanthonee Reis), is captured by Mason, they decide to execute their plan. There are many casualties and soon Curtis discovers that they have been manipulated by Wilford to balance the resources in the train, and why the magnate keeps the lower class alive.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil It's 2031, seventeen years after authorities in seventy-nine countries decided collectively to combat global warming with the coolant CW-7. The result was the Earth being immediately sent into a deep freeze, killing all human life except a handful who now live on an ""ark"", a revolutionary train built before 2014 by a train aficionado named Wilford (Ed Harris), the train which at that time was considered useless and self-indulgent. The train is required to be constantly moving to generate energy for life inside, it which circumnavigates the globe on a single continuous track once every year. The train is still controlled in all of its aspects by Wilford, who has created three separate classes housed in different parts of the train: the privileged ""one percent"", who are at the front of the train, the workers who support both ends and occupy the middle of the train, and the ""tail people"", the masses who live at the back of the train like cattle in a windowless cattle car, they being solely fed protein bars, whose ingredients the tail people do not know. The face of Wilford's ideology to those in the tail end is Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton), as Wilford never ventures to that end of the train. Some of the policies which Wilford has implemented is taking many of the children from the tail end for an unknown purpose never to be seen by the people in the tail end again, and committing occasional indiscriminate genocide in the tail end, most of the tail people believing as a method of population control, and to demonstrate his dictatorial power in an effort to have a complacent populace amongst the masses. There have been many attempts of revolution by the tail people in the past, all quashed by Wilford. Curtis (Chris Evans), one of the tail people, wants to attempt another revolution, he believing all past attempts having failed because they have focused on Wilford, as opposed to what he feels needs to occur for power: take control of the engine at the front. Supporting Curtis in this fight are, amongst others: Gilliam (Sir John Hurt), the wise old man; Edgar (Jamie Bell), who Curtis took under his wing when he became orphaned in the early years; and Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Andrew (Ewen Bremner), who want to find their children taken away. Along the way, they have to co-opt Namgoong Minsoo (Song Kang-ho), an addict of a synthetic hallucinogen called Kronole, he who designed the security system, namely the locking mechanism of the gates between all the train cars. As Curtis and his team try to work their way from car to car from the tail to the front, their priorities are influenced by what they see, what they learn, and by revelations including secrets from their individual pasts.—Huggo In 2014, an attempt to counteract global warming through climate engineering backfires catastrophically, unintentionally causing an ice age that extinguishes all life except the inhabitants of the Snowpiercer, a massive train powered by a perpetual motion engine that travels a circumnavigational track, created by the transportation magnate Wilford. By 2031, elites inhabit the extravagant front cars and the ""scum"" inhabit the tail in squalid and brutal conditions. Under watch by Wilford's guards, they are brought only gelatinous protein bars to eat and kept in their place in the social order by Minister Mason, while sometimes small children are taken away.Conspiring with his mentor Gilliam, Curtis Everett leads the tail passengers in a revolt that he plans will take them all the way up to the engine. Overpowering the guards, they release security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison car so as to disable the locks between cars. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that if they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices his second-in-command Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and agrees to give free passage to Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, and three other rebels: Gilliam's bodyguard Grey, and Andrew and Tanya who have had their respective children Andy and Timmy taken away.They travel through several luxurious cars and arrive at a classroom, where the teacher expounds to the children and the rebels on the greatness of Wilford and the ""sacred engine"". While distracted by the celebration of the New Year marking one circumnavigation of the globe, the teacher ambushes them, killing Andrew before Grey kills her. Further back, Franco and Mason's soldiers use the same distraction to kill the rebel army and many of the tail passengers. Franco executes Gilliam, and Curtis kills Mason in revenge. Curtis' group continues forward, followed by Franco, leading to a violent fight in a sauna car during which Franco kills Grey and Tanya before Curtis subdues him.At the gate to the engine, Namgoong reveals that he plans to use Kronole, a hallucinogen he has gathered from the elites they passed, as an explosive to blow a hatch to the outside, as he observed signs the world outside is thawing. Curtis confesses to him that shortly after boarding the train, the tail passengers resorted to cannibalism to survive, and he is haunted by his part in it. He was nearly ready to kill infant Edgar when Gilliam offered his own arm instead. After years of disdain for Wilford, Curtis seeks to learn what Wilford's intentions were.Wilford's assistant emerges from the engine, shoots Namgoong, and invites Curtis inside where he meets an aging Wilford. Wilford reveals to Curtis that his revolution was actually orchestrated by himself and Gilliam to reduce the population and maintain the balance of the sealed ecosystem, and subsequently orders the elimination of 74% of the remaining tail passengers. He explains the importance of using fear and chaos to maintain a necessary order and leadership on the train. After letting Curtis experience being alone for the first time in seventeen years, Wilford asks Curtis to replace him. Curtis appears ready to accept, when Yona runs in and pulls up a floorboard, showing Curtis that small children from the tail section are being trapped as replacement parts for ""extinct"" machinery; the tail section only serves to provide this resource to the engine. Curtis subdues Wilford and sacrifices an arm to save Timmy from this work.Namgoong revives and as he is overrun by Franco and the front sectioners, he lights the fuse on the Kronole. Curtis and Namgoong tightly embrace Yona and Timmy, protecting them from the explosion. The noise triggers an avalanche that derails the train. Yona and Timmy, apparently the only survivors, emerge from the wreckage and see a polar bear, proof that life exists outside the train."
The Railway Man,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2058107/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A former British Army officer, who was tortured as a prisoner of war at a Japanese labor camp during World War II, discovers that the man responsible for much of his treatment is still alive and sets out to confront him. Eric Lomax was one of thousands of Allied prisoners of war forced to work on the construction of the Thai/Burma railway during WW2. His experiences, after the secret radio he built to bring news and hope to his colleagues was discovered, left him traumatised and shut off from the world. Years later, he met Patti, a beautiful woman, on a train and fell in love. Patti was determined to rid Eric of his demons. Discovering that the young Japanese officer who haunted her husband was still alive, she faced a terrible decision. Should Eric be given a chance to confront his tormentor? Would she stand by him, whatever he did?—Anonymous During the Second World War, Eric Lomax is a British officer who is captured by the Japanese in Singapore and sent to a Japanese POW camp, where he is forced to work on the Thai-Burma Railway north of the Malay Peninsula. During his time in the camp as one of the Far East prisoners of war, Lomax is tortured by the Kempeitai (military secret police) for building a radio receiver from spare parts. The torture depicted includes beatings, food deprivation and waterboarding. Apparently, he had fallen under suspicion of being a spy, for supposedly using the British news broadcast receiver as a transmitter of military intelligence. In fact, however, his only intention had been to use the device as a morale booster for himself and his fellow prisoner-slaves. Lomax and his surviving comrades are finally rescued by the British Army.Some 30 years later, Lomax is still suffering the psychological trauma of his wartime experiences, though strongly supported by his wife Patricia. His best friend and fellow ex-POW Finlay brings him evidence that one of their captors, Japanese secret police officer Takashi Nagase, is now working as a tourist guide in the very camp where he and his men once tortured British POWs, having escaped prosecution for his war crimes. Before Lomax can act on this information, Finlay, unable to handle his memories of his experiences, commits suicide by hanging himself from a bridge. Lomax travels alone to Thailand and returns to the scene of his torture to confront Nagase 'in an attempt to let go of a lifetime of bitterness and hate'. When he finally confronts his former captor, Lomax first questions him in the same way Nagase and his men had interrogated him years before.The situation builds up to the point where Lomax prepares to smash Nagase's arm, using a club and a clamp designed by the Japanese for that purpose and now used as war exhibits. Out of guilt, Nagase does not resist, but Lomax redirects the blow at the last moment. Lomax threatens to cut Nagase's throat and finally pushes him into a bamboo cage, of the kind in which Lomax and many other POWs had been placed as punishment. Nagase soon reveals that the Japanese (including himself) were brainwashed into thinking the war would be a victorious one for them, and that he never knew the high casualties caused by the Imperial Japanese Army. Lomax finally frees Nagase, throws his knife into the nearby river, and finally at peace with himself, returns to Britain.After an indefinite period of time, Lomax returns, with Patricia, to Thailand. He meets up with Nagase once again, and in an emotional scene, after exchanging and accepting each other's apologies, the two make peace. The epilogue relates that Nagase and Eric remained friends until their deaths in 2011 and 2012, respectively."

As a result, the orphaned Ida will accompany Wanda on a journey of investigation, thirsting to discover the fate of her parents during the hard times of the Nazi occupation, however, is she ready for yet another shocking revelation, one that will demand an inevitable decision?—Nick Riganas Circa 1962. The movie opens with three noviatiate nuns gathered around a Christ statute, an obvious gathering place for the girls. It is clear that the girls are friends. The statute is placed outside a convent, which at all times, it and its grounds are covered with snow.The Mother Superior calls in Anna and tells her that her aunt has asked for her to come to visit her. This surprises Anna who was an orphan from birth. She does not want to go but the Mother Superior insists.Anna travels by public transportation to the city to meet her aunt, with a short stay-over with another family, before she meets her Aunt, Wanda. Wanda's apartment is obviously well-to-do. (Wanda, it turn out, is a stern judge, who won't be played the fool by anyone. She's also an alcoholic.) She shows Anna pictures of her family including a man, woman and little boy. Anna is told that she did not have a brother. Wanda also reveals that Anna, a Catholic noviate about to take her vows, is Jewish. Her name is Ida. Her parents were killed during the war. Anna does not accept this at first. Wanda guesses that under her novitiate veil, Anna's hair is red, like her mother's. and later we see that Anna is a redhead. Wanda also tells Anna that her mother was very artistic and empathetic and would even make stained glass windows for the cow barn so the cows could have something to look at.Anna wants to find their bodies, but the Aunt demurs, stating that Jewish victims were buried all over the place during the war, and Anna will never find them. Anna insists and she and her aunt start on a journey to Anna's family home as a starting place to find the bodies. Along the way, Anna stops to pray at roadside shrines, while her aunt waits in the car, smoking. Upon arrival at the family home, a new family lives there. Only the young wife and baby are home and she denys knowledge of the prior owners, telling them that her husband will be home at 4 o'clock and shoos them away. Anna and Wanda pass the hours differently. Anna goes to a church to pray and her aunt drinks and may have picked up a guy. They return to the home to find a very hostile husband.The aunt is looking for the husband's father as he was the one sheltering Anna's family from the Germans in the woods behind the house. The aunt's questioning bcomes an interrogation and Anna wanders outside. She is drawn to the barn to pet a cow and notices that the barn has a stained glass window. Presumably, the husband tells the Aunt the name of the town where the father is now living.Along the way to the father's town, they pick up a hitchiker, who happens to be a sax player in a band which is going to celebrate the town's centennial. He and Anna notice each other in the car. Several significant things happen in the town. Wanda questions the father, who is in the hospital. He states that Anna's family was a good family ahd he hid them. Wanda then questions/states that then he killled them and probably used an axe. The father says nothing.Anna and Wanda share a room. Wanda is contemptuous of Anna's devotion and questions how she can take vows to give up a life she has never experienced. At night, the band plays and Anna refuses to go down to the party. Again, it is implied Wanda had sex with a guy she picked up in the bar as she and Anna afterward fight over virtue with Wanda pointing out that Jesus had a soft spot for Mary Magdelene. Anna leaves the room, angry and confused. She is confronted by husband who states that he will tell her where the bodies are buried if Anna signs away all rights to the house and land he now lives upon. She agrees.The next day, the husband takes the two women through confusing woods. He does not appear to be looking or a spot but is traveling directly to an area in a dense forest. He digs. Finally, his shovel starts throwing up bones. It is revealed here that he, not his father, killed Anna's parents. Also, he killed the little boy because he had dark hair and was circumcised. He spared Anna because she was a baby and no one could tell she was Jewish. He dropped the baby off at a local church. We also find out that the little boy was Wanda's son. She had left him with Anna's parents, thinking he would be safe with them. The women gather the bones and take them to a family plot, where they rebury them.Anna returns to the convent to prepare to take her vows. At dinner, a dreary affair, she gets the giggles, but restrains herself. In watching other noviatiates bathe, she recognizes carnal desire within herself. After all of the preparations, the night before the final vow ceremony, Anna goes to the Christ statute and tells God that she is not ready to take her vows. Later, she attends the vow ceremony to watch her friends, and cries.The aunt seems to continue life. She is seen making breakfast. She opens the window wide to greet the day. She turns on her on her phonograph and lights a cigarette. She turns up the music louder and goes out of the room. She returns, walking very quickly, taps the ash off of her cigarette and walks right out the window, falling to her death (not shown).Anna returns to the city and attends the funeral. Alone in her aunt's apartment, she takes off her veil. She experiments with drinking alcohol and smoking. She goes to the aunt's funeral, looking hung over. The sax player is also there.Anna puts on her aunt's sexy clothes and goes to see the sax player that night. They make love. When she asks, ""What's next?"" the sax player casually responds that he and the band are going to Gdansk and she could come along. Upon further pressure, he says they could get a dog, a house and have children. Live life.In the morning, Anna is seen putting back on her veil. She quietly leaves with her suitcase. She is last seen walking down a wintry road, presumably back to the convent."

Nica notices a human Charles Lee ""Chucky"" Ray in one of the movies. Alice comes downstairs and notifies everyone that Chucky is gone. Nica finds the return address from the package Chucky arrived in. She tries to call the number, but the storm is causing on and off blackouts and blocking cellphone signals. Jill puts Alice to bed and starts looking for Chucky. While in the kitchen, Barb comes in and passionately kisses Jill, indicating an affair. Nica returns to the living room and finds Chucky sitting on the sofa next to a sleeping Ian. Nica uses the house elevator to take Chucky to Alice, but a blackout occurs and Chucky cuts her leg with a knife. The power returns and the elevator takes Nica to the second floor where Alice takes Chucky and goes to bed.After everyone else goes to their rooms, Nica goes downstairs and looks up ""Chucky Doll Evidence"" on the internet, where she reads the stories of his murders and realizes that Chucky is alive. Jill goes to Alice's room, strips down to her underwear, and starts video chatting with Barb in another bedroom next to Ian. While talking in video chat Barb tries to warn Jill that Alice is up (not knowing that is Chucky). Jill looks down and sees Chucky holding a knife. Chucky kicks a bucket of rain water over. The water touches Jill's feet and a power outlet, electrocuting her to death and causing another blackout. Barb goes to check on Alice.

Barb leaves the room after Ian puts in earplugs to tune her out.Barb finds Chucky sitting on stairs that lead to the attic. Thinking that Alice is in the attic, Barb picks up Chucky and goes up to look for her. Meanwhile,with the elevator unusable due to the blackout, Nica crawls up the stairs to the second floor. In the attic, Barb notices the knife in Chucky's overalls. She sets Chucky down on a trunk and continues her search for Alice. Barb turns around and sees Chucky sitting on a shelf. She notices that parts of Chucky's face is peeling. Barb peels off the plastic coating on Chucky's face, exposing his stitches and scars from the previous film. Chucky comes alive and gouges out one of Barb's eyes with his knife.
Nica makes it to the attic's stairs. Chucky throws Barb's eyeball down the stairs. Barb then falls down the stairs dead. Chucky makes his way down the stairs towards Nica. Nica gets a wheelchair from the hallway closet and rolls away with Chucky in pursuit. Nica stops at Alice's room and sees that she has disappeared.

Ian returns to the garage and sees Nica with the hatchet. Ian, now suspecting Nica of the murders, disarms her. The stress of the entire situation causes Nica to suffer a heart attack and lose consciousness.
Nica regains consciousness. Ian has tied her to her wheelchair and looks at footage from the nanny cam that Chucky is not responsible for the murders. The footage shows that Chucky is alive and hid Alice in a closet and the affair between Barb and Jill. Chucky comes in and uses Nica's wheelchair to run Ian over. Chucky then uses the hatchet to chop off Ian's lower jaw, killing him. Chucky attacks Nica lodging the hatchet into her knee, but she manages to break out of her restraints and knock out Chucky. Chucky gets back up and Nica uses the hatchet to decapitate him.Nica turns her back to tend to her wounds. Chucky gets up and reattaches his head. Chucky then grabs Nica's wheelchair, pushes her down the hall and through the balcony. Nica falls to the ground floor. Chucky walks downstairs and taunts Nica. Nica asks why Chucky is doing this. Through flashbacks, Chucky explains that he was a friend of the family. He was in love with Sarah, but she was married and pregnant with Nica. Chucky killed Sarah's husband and kidnapped her some time after the funeral. After Sarah rejects him, Chucky stabs her in the stomach before fleeing from the police. The stab to Sarah's stomach is what caused Nica to be born a paraplegic. The kidnapping led to Chucky's death as a human, setting off the chain of events of the franchise.
The electricity returns long enough for Nica to make it into the elevator. Chucky cuts Nica's fingers before dropping the knife into the elevator. Nica, now holding the knife, urges Chucky to attack her. Chucky lunges at Nica and is stabbed in the back. Nica attempts to leave the elevator, but Chucky springs back to life. A police officer arrives at the house and hears Nica scream. He enters the house and sees Nica in the elevator still holding the bloody knife. He looks around and sees Barb's body upstairs while Chucky watches from a nearby chair.Some time later, Nica is found guilty of the murders and sent to an asylum. As Nica is being wheeled out of court, she taunts Chucky (a piece of evidence) that she is still alive. The arresting officer takes Chucky and prepares to take it to an unknown person, and tells the unknown person at the other end of the phone to have his money ready. The officer sees the plastic bag Chucky is in moving because of his breathing. Before he looks inside, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) pops up in the backseat and slits his throat. Tiffany then mails Chucky to his next target.Alice, now living with her grandmother, comes home from school. Alice looks for her grandmother, but finds Chucky instead. She asks where her grandmother is and Chucky replies ""in the cellar"". Chucky persuades Alice to play ""Hide The Soul"". The camera pans away as Chucky says the chant that will transfer his soul to Alice's body. Before the screen cuts to black, Alice's screaming grandmother pops up on the screen with a plastic bag over her head.After the credits, Chucky is delivered to the now adult Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent). When Andy turns his back to answer a phone call from his mother, Chucky cuts his way out of the package. Chucky looks at an old photo of Andy and his mother from when he was a kid, before turning his attention to Andy. Andy, anticipating Chucky coming after him, holds a shotgun to Chucky's head. Chucky is surprised when Andy remarks, ""Play with this"", before pulling the trigger."

With Murray acting as his ""manager"", the duo quickly finds themselves caught up in the crosscurrents of love and money. Murray, the bankrupt owner of a bookstore, is forced to close his family business. His dermatologist, Dr. Parker, dreams of having a threesome and would pay a thousand dollars to have one with her friend Selima. Murray then proposes to his friend Fioravante that they start a male prostitution business, with Murray acting as the pimp. However, when Fioravante meets a Hasidic Jewish woman, Avigal, who is the widow of a rabbi, they fall in love with each other. But a Jewish neighborhood patrolman, Dovi, is in love with Avigal too, and might make life difficult for Fioravante and Murray.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In a predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Brooklyn, elderly Murray Schwartz is forced to close his rare used books bookstore - opened originally by his grandfather - due to poor business, leaving him in financial straits, he already living in a platonic situation with an African-American single mother named Othella and her large brood of children. He stumbles onto a potential opportunity to get out of the hole stemming from a casual social conversation with his wealthy, married dermatologist, Dr. Parker. Dr. Parker and her Latina friend Selima want to engage in a ménage à trois, and want to find that male third, she asking Murray if he knows anyone suitable. Murray responds that he does - for a hefty price. Who he wants to ""pimp out"" is his long time friend, middle-aged Fioravante, as although Fioravante is not traditionally handsome - something that Fioravante readily admits - he knows how to treat women. Fioravante, too, is in financial straits with his only current income coming from working two days a week at a florist shop, and the occasional freelance plumbing job. To help both himself and Murray out, Murray who would get a percentage of the cut, Fioravante reluctantly agrees, with both Dr. Parker and Selima wanting to take solo test drives with Fioravante before the big threesome. Murray and Fioravante's new oldest profession business becomes a successful one, their clients, including Dr. Parker ad Selima, who adore the fact that Fioravante is not a pretty boy but a real man who focuses more on them than on himself. Although doing it primarily for the money, both Murray and Fioravante have a benevolent side to their business as Murray believes Fioravante's caring nature would benefit an orthodox Jewish acquaintance, Avigal, who has been unable to move on emotionally with her life in a holistic sense following the death of her rabbi husband two years ago.

The To Do List,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1758795/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Feeling pressured to become more sexually experienced before she goes to college, Brandy Klark makes a list of things to accomplish before hitting campus in the fall. Brandy Klark (Aubrey Plaza) has just graduated from high school where she excelled in every subject, except real-life sexual education. When her older sister tells her how important it is to be experienced, Brandy writes out a sex to do list for herself for the summer. Her friend Cameron might be the perfect guinea pig while she sets her sights on the popular and sexy Rusty Waters as the ultimate end goal. But once feelings get in the way, it becomes much harder for Brandy to check off the remaining items on her sex to do list.—napierslogs The year is 1993. Brandy Klark (Aubrey Plaza) is the brainy teen who's always home studying while her friends are out partying. Now, as graduation looms, she starts to realize just how much fun she's been missing out on. Of course Brandy's grades are impressive, but how is a girl who's barely even kissed a guy supposed to handle the freedom of college life? In order to get a leg up, Brandy compiles a list of all of the erotic extracurricular activities she's missed out on and attempts to cross them off one by one. When the task proves more demanding than the previously chaste teen had anticipated, she rounds up a crew of her closest friends to help undertake some hilariously unconventional college prep.. 1993. Brandy Klark, who has just graduated at the top of her class at Merriwether High School in Boise, Idaho, has focused her entire existence on academic excellence at the expense of all else, this focus making her a proverbial goody-two-shoes, which is just fine especially with her conservative father, Judge George Klark. That focus also blinds her to that her friend, and science lab and study partner, Cameron Mitchell, has long mooned over her in a severe case of puppy love. That focus changes when Brandy has her first case of lust in spotting college guy Rusty Waters at what is her first keg party. In speaking to her sexually aggressive older sister Amber Klark - the two who generally do not get along in their differences - Brandy decides to try to lose her virginity before she heads off to college in the fall. In her academic mindset in wanting to make losing her virginity the best experience it can be, Brandy develops a to do list of other sexual activities before that final act on the list, losing her virginity to Rusty, with who she will have the opportunity in learning he is a coworker in her summer job as a lifeguard at a community outdoor swimming pool. Along with Amber, her more sexually experienced best friends Fiona and Wendy act as her official guides, with Brandy's mother, Jean Klark, who is more liberal than her husband, acting as an unofficial guide in solely wanting Brandy to have a safe yet enjoyable first experience whenever it may happen. Even with this help, Brandy may make many missteps along the way especially as she doesn't even know what several activities on the list entail in the euphemisms that Amber, Fiona and Wendy use. Who also factors into what happens is Cameron, who, regardless of knowing or not knowing what Brandy is up to, will want to be part of any sexual experience she has in his love for her.—Huggo"
Metallica Through the Never,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2172935/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Trip, a young roadie forMetallica, is sent on an urgent mission during the band's show. But what seems like a simple assignment turns into a surreal adventure. A young Metallica roadie named Trip (Dane DeHaan) embarks on an apocalyptic journey through a decimated urban landscape as the band plays to a sold-out arena crowd in this high-concept concert film from director Nimrod Antal (Predators). As the band takes the stage before thousands of screaming fans, Trip is informed that a driver tasked with delivering a crucial item has gotten stranded on the other side of the city. It's his job to recover it, but getting there won't be easy because as the elaborate concert gets underway, rioters and police begin clashing in the streets. The city is burning, and a mysterious, masked figure on horseback is thriving on the chaos. When Trip incurs the wrath of the ruthless, hammer-wielding psycho and his marauding gang, he realizes that he may not live long enough to complete his mission. Meanwhile, the show must go on, and Metallica thrills the crowd with a thunderous collection of classics that include ""Creeping Death"", ""Ride the Lightning"", ""Master of Puppets"", ""Battery"" and ""Enter Sandman.. The film opens with aerial footage of Vancouver and BC Place stadium with a radio DJ announcing Metallica's one-night-only concert. It then cuts to a heavy-metal fan driving into the empty parking lot and climbing on to the car's hood, whooping and laughing, but has difficulty due to his excessive weight. The film's main protagonist, Trip (Dane DeHaan) skates past the fan but wipes out. Trip is a roadie for Metallica. Skating into the underground parking, he gets a brown paper bag of something unknown from a beatup van and, venturing into the dressing room halls, encounters each of the band members. Giving the bag to his supervisor, Trip is told to ""stick around."" Standing in the main stadium arena, he then walks at a typical pace with the audience filing in to the arena in a time lapse to Metallica's traditional opener, Ecstasy of Gold.Metallica appears on stage and begins performing, and during Creeping Death, Trip's manager tasks him with bringing gas to a stranded truck carrying ""something very important."" Before driving his van, Trip ingests an unknown pill, alluded as a drug.As Metallica begins Fuel, Trip drives through the deserted streets with Metallica-esque flames on flat surfaces of the cityscape, alluding to the pill's effects or supernatural energy. Distracted by studying his map, Trip runs a red light but brakes late in the intersection's middle when he noticed a bloody hand smear on an illuminated sign. He gets t-boned by another driver, which subsequently flips the van.Crawling out of the van, Trip peers into the other car and, hearing radio reports of what's happening, calls to the unresponsive driver, who is standing with his back to Trip. The driver only briefly looks at Trip and start running past him, down the street. From the truck, Trip retrieves only a gas tank, a map, and a doll of unknown importance with a noose around its neck. As he exits, electricity crackles in the van from an unrevealed source, as a reference to the band's album, Ride The Lightning, as the title song off the album begins. Trip wanders down a street and a Police horse drags a dead officer across its path. After this, some people begin to run past him, oblivious, and some police cruisers speed past him, one ablaze. Emerging into the middle of a street, he realizes he has wandered between a large group of rioters and riot police, who are motionless. Gradually, the rioters start getting rowdier and more provocative, and when the police fire tear gas, the rioters swarm the police, in a full-on battle. Trip, stunned by the ferocity of the violence, stands by a window being strangely ignored. Suddenly, the window shatters behind Trip.In the heat of battle, a horseman (listed in the credits as The Rider, and known by some as ""The Death Dealer"") wearing a gas mask comes charging through, wielding a sledgehammer atop an armored horse. He pursues a rioter, lassoing his neck and hoisting the victim on a streetlamp, killing him. It is not formally indicated for which side The Rider fights. Enraged by this, Trip throws a brick at The Rider. This fixates The Rider on Trip, and he starts to pursue Trip, who loses the doll. Trip manages to evade The Rider by sneaking through a wall of rioters.Walking down a deserted street that is littered from an earlier battle, Trip walks under a dozen hanging bodies from a pedestrian bridge; it is unrevealed as to how they got there. Trip finds the truck he was tasked to give fuel to in a deserted parking garage corridor, but the driver, a middle aged man, is too traumatized in the cab to heed the presence of Trip. The back of the truck is opened with nothing but a leather bag which Trip opens, but the camera pans away. Trip just slumps down, speechless.Sitting around, Trip notices a figure waving at him from a distance. The Rider rides up behind the man, and suddenly a swarm of mobbers surge past the two. It is left unstated if they are the pre-encountered rioters or The Rider's minions (assuming The Rider is a supernatural entity). Trip then grabs the bag and tank of gas, jumps out of the truck, and flees.Unable to shake off the pack of mobbers, Trip is cornered at the end of an alley with the mobbers closing on him. For an unexplained reason, Trip ties a red bandanna around his mouth, puts up his hoodie, and drops the bag. Picking up the gas tank, Trip pours the gas onto himself and sets himself ablaze, and then charges the mobbers, being beaten collectively.Trip wakes on a building rooftop (with Enter Sandman starting), while the doll he lost has become animated and is walking to the leather bag. As Trip is getting up, a noose is lassoed on Trip, and he is pulled upon The Rider's horse. Trip grabs The Rider's hammer to free himself. The Rider rides to the opposite end of the rooftop and starts to charge Trip, who picks up the hammer and slams the floor with it, sending unexplained earthquake-style shock waves across the city, shattering all the glass and structural exteriors of surrounding buildings and disintegrating The Rider and his steed to dust. This also has the effect of reverberating throughout Metallica's concert, interrupting it with a blackout of power, and causing lighting trusses to fall. The concert staff eventually hook up a back-up generator, and the band continues the concert without the pyrotechnics and light props.Trip arrives back at the stadium with the doll and the bag under his arm, finding the arena deserted with the concert either over or yet to start. During the credits, intercut scenes of the band performing Orion play to the deserted stadium. When Trip walks through the venue and takes a seat wearing his same clothes, the ending shot is the leather bag, which is never opened."

An underachieving vocal coach is motivated by her father, the king of movie-trailer voice-overs, to pursue her aspirations of becoming a voiceover star. Amidst pride, sexism and family dysfunction, she sets out to change the voice of a generation.—Anonymous Thirty year old Carol Solomon barely ekes out a living as an elocution teacher and the more lucrative work as a voice over actor, she trying to follow in the footsteps of her successful father, who goes by the stage name Sam Soto, and with who she still lives in her precarious financial situation. Sam has been up front with her in that only a handful get most of that voice over work - he being one of that handful - and most of it in its entirety, apart from dubbing of female roles, the domain of men, whose speaking voices the public generally prefers to hear. Carol's life takes a further hit when Sam asks her to move out to make way for his thirty-one girlfriend Jamie to move in - she who Carol and Carol's sister Dani, a hotel concierge, mockingly refer to as Sam's groupie - leaving Carol no other option but to move in with Dani and Dani's work-at-home husband, Moe. Upon the death ofDon LaFontaine, the undisputed king of the voice over business, the others near the top of heap, most specifically Sam and younger Gustav Warner, battle it out to be known as Don's heir apparent. It becomes even more important to get the foot in the door of the space vacated by Don as arguably Don's most famous voice over work, which begins with the subordinate clause ""In a world..."", will be resurrected by a new voice over actor for the trailers for an upcoming movie quadrology. Carol's career gets an unexpected bump by being in the right place at the right time for some voice over work that was supposed to go to Gustav. Gustav and Sam have no idea who the voice is that stole the work from Gustav, and Gustav further doesn't know that Carol, who he meets at a party, is either that voice or Sam's daughter. Thus begins the battle behind the scenes between the three, Carol, who is grateful for any voice work, getting some help from Lewis the sound engineer at the studio where she does most of her work, socially awkward Lewis who has a crush on her.

""I really appreciate you taking a chance on me."" Huling ""I'm using you for a bigger purpose. This pseudo-feminist fantasy tween chick-lit bullshit is a devolution of the female mission. It's cancerous to the intelligence of young women. You got this job because whether the general public chooses to acknowledge it or not, voice over matters. Everyone in the world watches movie trailers. Everyone in the world sees commercials on television, hears them on the radio. . . And that is power! This quadrilogy is going to make billions of dollars and your voice is going to be the one to inspire every girl who hears it. And that's why I chose you. Not because you were the best for the job. Because frankly you weren't. I bet your dad is proud.""Gustav Warner makes the presentation of the Golden Trailer Lifetime Achievement Award to Sam Sotto. Sam's voice is cracking ""a great voice is a blessing and a choice... my father would say 'you are good kid but as long as I'm around you will never be as good as me.'

Thank you.""In the final scene, a group of women are cheering after viewing the quadrilogy trailer in Louis's sound mixing studio. Carol stands before a sign: 'Voice Over the vocal make over. Find your voice and get ready to be heard.' Carol is now back at her old job as a voice coach to a group of squeaky voiced women.One of the women, named Stacy (Corsica Wilson), (the same woman who asked Carol for directions to a smoothie place earlier) explains to the group: ""I'm a corporate attorney, and I've been interviewing for a job for 10 months. But no job because I sound like a sexy baby.""Carol adds: ""Women should sound like women.... [squeaky voice] not baby dolls who end everything with a question? [normal voice] In the next six weeks we are going to learn to make a statement. Now, who is ready to be heard?""Carol then leaves the booth to meet with Louis and Dani to discuss business while Stacy and the rest of the squeaky-voiced women are practicing their pronunciation of words.End credits."

Under the Skin,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441395/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mysterious young woman seduces lonely men in the evening hours in Scotland. However, events lead her to begin a process of self-discovery. An alien entity inhabits the earthly form of a young woman who combs the roads and streets of Scotland in search of the human prey she came to plunder. She seduces her isolated and forsaken male victims into an otherworldly dimension where they are stripped and consumed. However, existence in all its complexity begin to change the alien visitor. She begins to discover herself as human with tragic and terrifying consequences.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In Glasgow, a motorcyclist (Jeremy McWilliams) retrieves an inert young woman (Lynsey Taylor Mackay) from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman (Scarlett Johansson) dons her clothes. After buying clothes and make-up at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van around Scotland, picking up men. She lures a man (Joe Szula) into a dilapidated house. As he undresses, following the woman into a void, he is submerged in a liquid abyss... An alien in the guise of a seductive woman (Johansson) prowls the streets of Glasgow in search of prey - unsuspecting men who fall under her spell. The victims are then stripped and consumed. However, human existence in all its complexity begin to change the alien visitor. In the opening shot, there is a tiny ball of light, which turns into a bright circular flash, slowly coming into view with a circular object. Amidst the ominous tone that plays, we hear a woman's voice making sounds, trying to get her speech down to being perfect (down to a Scottish accent). We see what appears to be a black liquid circular pool. The light and the circular object come together to form an eye - a mysterious woman's eye.A shot of a long curving road among the mountains of Scotland with a single headlight appears. The view changes and we see it is an unknown man on a motorcycle.The man rides his motorcycle to a tunnel where he stops. He gets off the bike and walks off the road into a ditch, appearing a moment later carrying a young woman's body. We assume he knew the body was there because he goes directly to it, so he either knows how she died or was involved in killing her. He throws the body into the back of a white van.Next, we see the woman's dead body being unceremoniously undressed by another naked young woman (Scarlett Johansson) in a completely white, brightly lit room. This scene contrasts with the scenes of dark/black rooms we will see later in the movie. After the woman is dressed, she stands over the body and stares at it. The camera focuses on the now nude woman's body and we see a tear fall from her eye. (We are not sure at this point if she was indeed dead, and the tear was simply a reflex, or if she is perhaps in some catatonic state.) The name and identity of this woman remains unknown throughout the film, but due to the tear falling, and due to the motorcycle man knowing exactly where the body was, she may have been in some sort of comatose state and aware of what was going on. The woman who took the clothing bends down over the body and seems to inspect something she picked up from the body. It appears to be an ant that was crawling on the dead/comatose woman's body.The next scene opens with a cloudy sky and mysterious lights above a tall skyscraper. This scene is supposed to indicate that it is an alien presence that the film is depicting, although this particular scene is so brief the significance of it is lost unless the viewer pays close attention.The mysterious female (at this point we are unclear if she is an alien, a succubus, or some sort of machine, but since the movie is based on a book that was written about an alien, the prevailing theory is that she is an alien) is then seen leaving a dirty rundown looking house. The white van is parked outside, and the motorcycle man is there as well. The relationship between the two is unclear at this point, although they seem connected (In the book, the male is the female alien's superior officer, and in the film we see hints of this relationship, although sparse and unexplained). These two, although seen together in a few scenes, and often in the same areas, do not communicate at all in the film, leaving us to assume they communicate telepathically or some other way. The man departs on his motorcycle, and the woman gets into the white van and begins to drive.The following scene opens with the mysterious young woman/alien in a crowded shopping mall. She seems to pick out several items of clothing including a faux fur coat and red lipstick. She then continues to drive in the white van around Glasgow, eyeing men as she drives past. She passes through several crowds of people before stopping on a less crowded street to approach a man who is alone, like any good predator would. She asks him for directions to the local M8 motorway and they converse. Several separate scenes repeat the same pattern- she seeks out lone men walking and asks for directions or some other banal topic. She asks basic questions of these men, such as their names, where they are from, and also more in depth questions that lead you to think her intentions might be more sinister. She asks questions such as if they are alone, if they have a family, if they are going anywhere, and also more personal questions, studying her prey, such as, ""Why do you like to be alone?"" She drives off when a subject appears to not fit her criteria - at one point, a siren from a police car sounds nearby, and she drives away. At another point, one of the men she is speaking to is called to from somewhere in the distance. She loses interest and drives off. When she is able to determine a candidate is adequate, she invites him into her van for a ride and begins another line of questions - ""Do you have a girlfriend? Do you think I'm pretty?"" Finally, she finds a man with a green and white scarf who fits her criteria, and we see them entering the run-down house. The surroundings fade to black, and as she looks at the man seductively over her shoulder, undressing, he follows, also undressing. Once the man is completely naked, as he approaches her, instead of getting closer, he suddenly sinks into the floor, as if it were made of liquid. The man appears not to notice, seeming to be hypnotized by the woman. Once he has fully disappeared, the mysterious alien/woman picks up her clothing and walks off camera.Some time passes, and we can assume the alien woman continues her preying on men, due to scenes of her in the van again driving around.The alien woman is at the beach, and we see her watching a solo male swimming in a wet suit. When he comes ashore she begins her line of questions, what is he doing here, why is he in Scotland. The two are interrupted by the screams of a woman being pushed out to sea by huge waves after she tries swimming out to save her drowning dog, and a man in a heavy coat seems to be swimming after her. The man in the wet suit rushes over to help, while the alien woman stands there watching, completely passive, as these events progress. The woman in the water is eventually lost to sight, but the man in the wet suit manages to pull the man in the heavy coat, presumably the woman's husband, to shore, only to have the man rush back into the waters chasing after his wife, who has already been swept too far out. The man in the wet suit, exhausted from his efforts, does not chase him, instead collapsing on the shore. We seem him move so we know he is alive. Finally, the alien woman springs into action, at first we think to help, but what she does instead is find a rock and bash the man in the wet suit in the head, to ensure he is either unconscious or dead.The scene cuts to another part of the beach where she is dragging the body of the man in the wet suit past a crying child. Since the man in the wet suit was alone, we can assume the baby belonged to the man and the woman who were swept to sea. The alien woman is completely unfazed by the crying child, intent on her task of dragging the body. She eventually gets the body in the car, and we see the man on the motorcycle locate a tent on the beach which we can assume belonged to the man in the wet suit. He appears to fold up the tent, and take it with him. We are reminded of the opening scene in which he had originally found a woman either dead or comatose, so we can assume either he or another alien made a victim of that woman, and he was sent to clean it up like he is doing now. We hear the child still crying, and it is now night - the motorcycle man walks toward the child as if to console him, or to pick him up, but stops a few feet away and bends to pick up an article of clothing that was left behind - as if the wet suit man's body and taking all of his personal belongings are of significance, but the crying child is not. We also see the woman, back in the van, and hear crying again - she seems to notice the crying this time, but looks out her window to see she is back in the city, and the crying is from the vehicle next to her, where a child is in the back seat of a vehicle parked nearby. It is not the same child from the beach, but perhaps she was thinking about that child.The woman is next seen that evening in her white van in a parking lot. In the car on the other side of her is a group of rowdy men who seem to catcall her. She follows them around what seems like an abandoned building, and when she sees the man who called to her alone outside, she exits the van and starts to approach. As she nears the other side of the building, she suddenly sees a large crowd and realizes the man has gone into a club. A crowd of outgoing women intercept her as she turns to leave and insist she go into the club with them. The alien looks absolutely baffled by these woman and gets ushered into the club with the throng of women urging her to do so. As soon as she enters the club there is loud music, flashing lights, and people everywhere. The first door that she sees, the alien woman escapes into, but it is not a door that leads outside, instead it leads to some sort odd lounge area, where she is again approached by the man who called to her from the road. He insists that she let him buy her a drink, and we see them dancing in the club.The scene then cuts to the all-black room in the run-down house where the first man sank into the floor. The club guy is dancing, half-naked. We see the alien woman undressing and staring at the club guy seductively. As she walks backward, the club guy sinks into the floor, exactly like the first man, staring at her so intently he seems not to notice that he is sinking. After he is gone, the alien woman walks off, and the camera suddenly pans to the view from under the liquid floor- the man stares up at her as she walks away, unaware of his surroundings until she is out of sight. It isn't until she leaves that he seems to suddenly be aware of what is around him - nothing but blackness, he appears to be frozen somehow, not able to move and the sound seems deadened around him, but he is otherwise alive. Suddenly he looks up, and he sees the first man who was swallowed into the floor with him, floating before him, also in an apparent state of frozen preservation. The first man we saw sink into the floor seems older somehow, his skin twisting oddly on his frame, and he seems to be screaming or mouthing to the club guy, but there is no sound coming from his mouth. The two drift closer to each other - close enough to barely touch hands for a moment, and then the first guy starts drifting backwards with a pleading look of helplessness on his face. Suddenly a sharp snap noise punctuates the silence, and the first victim POPS like a balloon- his skin stretching out and then shrivel-ling up, just like a popped balloon would. The empty skin floats aimlessly in the black void, twisting like a plastic bag in the wind. The man from the club stares in shock as the empty skin of the first victim gruesomely floats away. We see what looks like a rivulet of blood and debris being funneled down a conveyor belt of some type, followed by disturbing musical tones, and then a bright piercing of reddish light engulfs the screen. We can interpret this as the woman somehow either devouring these men inside of her body (the black goo) where they are destroyed and their skins kept, or another interpretation centering from the novel is that they are in a state of stasis so they can be sent to the alien world to be devoured by the aliens, and the man's body popping was him being eaten and the blood on the conveyor belt going down the hatch showing that he was killed and his body used by them, and the bright light following this scene is supposed to be another sign of alien presence although again, it is so subtle to the point of being almost insignificant.We see the alien woman in the van the next day. There is a broadcast on the radio about a body that was found washed up on the beach, obviously drowned. The broadcast references that the man was supposedly at the beach with his wife and 18-month-old child. Obviously, this was the man and woman from the beach with their child. The alien woman seems to pay attention to the broadcast, but shows little emotion. Throughout the day, rather than staring at men, she pays more attention to women and children. But, eventually she does find a man, who tells her she is gorgeous, and that there is something about her eyes (hypnotic, perhaps). She barely seems as interested in him as she was previously with the males she abducted. They end up at the run-down house, and the two are seen entering, but the scene fades to black.The woman is then seen applying her lipstick in a different room - this room is dark and with a cobbled stone floor, not the same dark room where she seduces and traps the men (resembling the interior of a stable or garage leading to an outside street). The motorcycle guy is there, and he paces around her angrily. It is obvious the two are communicating, albeit without words (maybe through telepathy). Something she has done has caused the motorcycle man to be displeased, causing him to somehow question or lecture her actions. (If the motorcycle man and the mysterious woman are communicating through telepathy, we do not hear and are not privy to the conversation... so one can only speculate). He stares into her eyes intently for a moment, and then abruptly turns away from her and leaves the room.The woman is walking down the street and is accidentally tripped and falls flat, face first onto the pavement where she lies still. It is almost as if she is shocked by this event. She lays there unmoving, and eventually a passersby pull her up, asking if she is okay and insisting on helping. She seems perturbed by these events and continues walking. She takes notice of the people around her who pass - not just the men, but women, children, elderly. It is as if she is noticing them for the first time - people smiling, laughing, going about their daily tasks. Almost as if she can see herself in them.Back in the van later that night, she watches as a single man crosses an empty street, but makes no move to approach him. A moment later, a younger man bangs on her window. He talks to her but he is muffled. He bangs harder and demands she roll down her window. Suddenly, more hoodlums show up and also bang on the windows, demanding she get out of the van. Could they possibly recognize her as the woman who picked up their friend from the club, or one of the other men she abducted? After all, she has been driving around for quite a while, approaching all the men she could find. She drives off and appears unfazed by the hoodlums.Later that night she finds a single man and uses her same ""I am lost"" conversation starter to approach him. (Adam Pearson). His face is disfigured due to a condition called neurofibromatosis. She picks him up and gives him a lift. She begins to ask him the typical questions, but does not seem to understand that the man is disfigured and odd-looking, and therefore outcast by society. The alien asks the man when he last touched someone, and if anyone has touched him. He is nervous and uncertain as she takes his hand and lets him caress her face. Perhaps she is thinking she can give this man something nobody else has- because of his disfigurement, he has not been with a woman, and because she is an alien, she does not have the same emotional disgust, fear or shock that other women project toward this man. She takes him into the run-down house and for the first time we see how truly dilapidated the structure is. In the all-black room we see a dark, shiny silhouette approach. The alien woman completely undresses, which is different as she usually stays partially clothed. She lures the disfigured man into the black liquid, but after he is submerged, we see a slender black skeleton on the screen before the scene cuts away to the woman walking down the stairs afterward, like she has done before after seducing her prey, only this time she pauses and gazes into a dirty mirror, staring into her own eyes, perhaps reflecting on what she has done. She stares for a long moment. Her gaze is pulled away by a fly tapping against the door, perhaps trapped like the man she just seduced.In the next scene, we see her leave the run-down house, with the deformed man alive, still naked, and seemingly still hypnotized, or not aware of what has transpired. She seems to let him free as he is seen walking naked through a field toward a town. It is dawn. The motorcyclist speeds into a housing estate, stopping by a bungalow. He strides up to a car in the driveway, smashes the driver's window and then reaches in to flick a button to open the boot. He then purposefully marches to the back garden where he meets the deformed man climbing through the fence. We do not see him kill or harm the deformed man, but we see from a distance him placing a body into the boot, all the time being watched by a neighbor from her window. As he drives off he looks at the woman, unconcerned.At this point, the film takes a different turn and focuses more on the alien woman's attempts to understand humanity, rather than hunting them as prey.Later that day, the alien woman is driving to a secluded beach. She has shed her faux fur coat. She stands in the fog at a lonely beach, perhaps taking it in, perhaps knowing she has done something wrong and unsure of what her next move should be. She hears singing in the background, and a bird chirping. We see her walking down a long abandoned dirt road in what looks like the middle of nowhere.The motorcycle man, meanwhile, stands by the mirror of the abandoned house, as if looking for some clue of what the alien woman might have been thinking.The alien woman has found a restaurant in the mountains. She watches the patrons eating, and is served a piece of delicious-looking chocolate cake. We see her carefully slice off a piece and take a bite, only to immediately spit it out. Any thought that she might still be human is gone at this point, as we realize that she cannot even do something like eat human food. She walks through the secluded mountain town as if she is going to leave, but a villager tells her the bus will be stopping soon, so she decides to wait at the bus stop. She seems uncomfortable, and that continues even after she gets on the bus. The bus driver questions her casually, as to why she is not wearing a coat, is she ""feeling alright?"" A man on the bus also questions her, concerned but also obviously interested in her. She gets off the bus with the passenger and together they go to the grocery store. She looks around at the items with confusion, as if she has never been in a store before. She is now wearing the man's jacket, and they go to his house. She takes notice of the people in the buildings around them as they walk. She watches TV with the man from the bus while he eats, her food remaining untouched. They listen to the radio, and she idly taps her fingers while music plays. The man brings her a cup of tea and bids her goodnight. She explores the room she is staying in, and inspects her naked body, carefully looking at her legs, toes and fingers.We see several men on motorcycles zooming down a road. They seem to go in different directions. They might be spreading out in search of the renegade alien woman.The next morning she goes for a walk with the man from the bus, and he lifts and carries her over a deep puddle. The motorcyclist stops over a busy overpass and looks in both directions, perhaps trying to sense where the alien woman has gone.Meanwhile, the nice treatment by the man from the bus causes her to exhibit more emotions. They are together in her room at his house and she turns to him as if to kiss him. He obliges, and they begin to undress. She seems unsure of what to do, which is funny considering how she had previously seduced so many men. She lets him take control, but before they can have intercourse, he seems to struggle while entering her. Sudden realization dawns on her, she grabs a light and gazes between her legs. It appears she has a human form that is not complete. She leaves the man's house, and we see her walking alone across a barren field surrounded by a vast forest. She is running, still wrapped in the coat she got from the man on the bus, and she is wet from rain. She may be running from shame or embarrassment after the incident with the guy from the bus, or she could be trying to evade the motorcycle men searching for her.She runs into a forest worker who begins talking to her about the forest, not getting any replies, and asking, ""Are you on your own?"" before wishing her well and leaving. Eventually, she comes across a stone-built hut for hikers in the woods. It continues to rain outside. She eyes a fireplace covered in black soot. Perhaps it reminds her of the dilapidated house with the black chamber where she would entrap men, or perhaps it simply reminds her that she is cold - something she rarely seemed to notice previously in the movie. She zips up her coat, huddles into a corner of the building and curls into a ball, falling asleep. Time passes and she awakens to find the forest worker in the cabin with her groping her. She snaps awake and runs from the cabin. She looks back but sees no one. She hides for a while until she realizes nobody is following and then she finds a logging truck, climbing into the driver's seat. She sees the forest worker approaching and honks the horn to alert anybody but, as nobody comes, she runs back into the forest with him in pursuit. He catches her and starts to violently rip off her clothes. She seems confused and scared, and in the struggle he not only rips her clothes but also her skin, to find she has another black skin underneath. He staggers away in shock and she gets up, slowly walks away and starts to peel off her human flesh from her head and upper body, kneels down and looks at her still-blinking human face, held in her lap. The forest worker sneaks up behind her, douses her in gasoline, and deploys a match. The alien, carrying her broken human flesh with her, stumbles away, but it is too late, the flames progress up her legs and we see her running across the hillside on fire. Not too far away, she collapses.We see the motorcycle man standing on a hilltop far above. It is unclear whether he sees the body burning, or if he suddenly lost any trace of the female alien and either knows she has come to harm or does not know what happened.In the final scene, we see the alien woman's form as nothing more than a pile of ash, the flames beginning to die down. The camera follows the smoke upwards as it drifts into the sky.The final shot is a prolonged view of snow falling from the sky."

However with the creation of the Super Saiyan God, will the Z-Fighters be able to defeat Lord Beerus? The events of Battle of Gods take place some years after the battle with Majin Buu, which determined the fate of the entire universe. Beerus, the God of Destruction, is tasked with maintaining some sort of balance in the universe. After awakening from a long slumber, Beerus is visited by Whis and learns that the galactic overlord Frieza has been defeated by a Super Saiyan from the North Quadrant of the universe named Goku, who is also a former student of the North Kai. Ecstatic over the new challenge, Goku ignores King Kai's advice and battles Beerus, but he is easily overwhelmed and defeated. Beerus leaves, but his eerie remark of ""Is there nobody on Earth more worthy to destroy?"" lingers on. Now it is up to the heroes to stop the God of Destruction before all is lost.—ForLand Hucy The film begins with the awakening of Bills, the God of Destruction. As he has his breakfast, his valet Whis enquires as to why he has awoken ahead of his schedule. Bills explains that hed had a dream of fighting a warrior called a Super Saiyan God. He confirms this dream with a visit to the Oracle Fish, who had predicted the battle (although the Fish cant remember the prediction, she agrees with Bills to avoid trouble).Bills and Whis first head to King Kais planet, where they meet Goku. Goku doesnt know anything about Super Saiyan God, but begs for an opportunity to spar with Bills. An amused Bills agrees, and to everyones shock he defeats Goku in two moves. He then concludes that Goku is not the Super Saiyan God, but heads to Earth to inquire about the other remaining Saiyans. King Kai sends a message ahead to Prince Vegeta, warning him that Bills is on his way to Earth and that not even Goku could stand against him.Meanwhile, on Earth its Bulma Briefs birthday party and everyone has come to celebrate it. Amidst all the festivities, the Pilaf Gang (enemies from Gokus childhood) sneak in to steal the Dragon Balls, enchanted heirlooms of Gokus family that grant your hearts desire. They are caught, but everyone assumes they are putting on an act and play along. Meanwhile, Videl is hiding a big secret from her husband Gohan...Amidst all this, both Vegeta and Bills and Whis arrive at the party. Vegeta immediately sees that Bills is a serious threat and tries to steer him away from the party, but Bulma invites him over to enjoy himself. Although Bills doesnt find any Super Saiyan God on Earth either, he consoles himself with the delicious food provided at the party. He then tries to sample some pudding, but Majin Buu eats it all up; this finally causes Bills to lose his temper and he swears to destroy the Earth. All the Z-Fighters engage Bills, but he defeats them effortlessly. Bulma slaps Bills for ruining her birthday and he slaps her back; this enrages Vegeta and he assaults Bills, but even he is beaten down by Bills.Just when all is lost, Goku arrives on Earth. Instead of a fight, he asks Bills for some time as they try to find the Super Saiyan God for him. He gathers the Dragon Balls and summons the Dragon Shenron, to wish for the Super Saiyan God. Shenron however cannot grant this wish: he explains it is a bygone power. On the Saiyans homeworld, five Saiyans transferred their power to one, creating a Super Saiyan God. This proved to be a divine mode that defeated evil, but was temporary and only lasted for a short while and fell into obscurity.Goku and the other Saiyans (his sons Gohan and Goten, and Vegeta and his son Trunks) try to form the Super Saiyan God, but nothing happens. Whis (who is sampling Earth food throughout the film) works out that Shenrons words were misinterpreted: for five Saiyans power to flow into one, they need SIX Saiyans. Videl solves this dilemma by revealing her secret: she is pregnant with Gohans daughter Pan. Now with the sufficient number, Goku gets a power transfer from the other five Saiyans and achieves Super Saiyan God!Bills and Goku have their long-awaited fight, but despite Goku giving his all Bills still manages to dominate him. He eventually tells Goku to admit defeat, and Goku does. Bills however admits that Goku gave him quite a fight, and lets him in on a secret: his valet Whis is his trainer and is a far better fighter than him. He also reveals another secret: there are 12 universes, of which the one they are residing in is the seventh there are bound to be greater sights and fighters beyond this universe, and in the next ones.A victorious Bills returns Goku to his friends, and proclaims that he shall now destroy the world... and obliterates a few feet of earth. He states hell come back and do the rest later, to Gokus delight and everyones relief. He apologizes to Bulma for slapping her and asks that she invite him to another party (and that there be pudding provided there). Bills and Whis return home, and Whis provides Bills with some wasabi sauce to taste. Its too hot for Bills and it drives him wild, forcing Whis to knock him out. Whis orders him to wake up in three years...The film ends with everyone on Earth returning to Bulmas party. Vegeta swears he will be the Super Saiyan God mode next time and Goku agrees, joking that Bulma should get slapped again to make it more effective. Piccolo deduces that this meant Goku had already arrived to Earth around the time of Billss rampage. Goku protests that he was looking for some means to stop Bills, but an angry Bulma, already upset by the joke, prepares to slap Goku..."

In front of others, Adèle grows, seeks herself, loses herself, and ultimately finds herself through love and loss. Adèle is a high school student who is beginning to explore herself as a woman. She dates men but finds no satisfaction with them sexually, and is rejected by a female friend who she does desire. She dreams of something more. She meets Emma who is a free spirited girl whom Adèle's friends reject due to her sexuality, and by association most begin to reject Adèle.

Together, Adèle and Emma explore social acceptance, sexuality, and the emotional spectrum of their maturing relationship.—ahmetkozan Adèle, a reserved schoolgirl on the cusp of adulthood, can only imagine what true love is. And the more she grows indifferent to her male classmates after a fumbled sexual experience, the more Adèle finds herself filled with unprecedentedly profound feelings--the unexpected result of a chance encounter with a mysterious, blue-haired woman. Now, the alluring vision of bohemian stranger Emma creeps up in Adèle's dreams, haunting her late-night fantasies. But growing up is challenging. Because, just like life, love hurts. Is blue the warmest colour?—Nick Riganas Chapter 1.In the opening shot, Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos), a young teenager living in Lille, France, is seen leaving her house in the morning to grab a bus and the subway to get to school.In class, they are reading 'The Life of Marianne'. The teacher speaks about chance encounters and how love at first sight can affect us. One boy says it would make him feel regret for not trying to talk to the other person. Adèle listens to all the discussion impassively.During lunch with her friends, they gush about sex while Adèle just listens. A boy, named Thomas (Jérémie Laheurte) looks at Adèle and smiles. Her girlfriends tell her that it is obvious that hes into her and she should do something about it, forcing her to take a look at him. But Adèle doesn't seem to be very interested in him. Shes actually quite detached. That evening at home, Adèle has dinner with her parents and discusses her day. She later writes in her diary and then goes to sleep.The next day, Adèle gets on the bus where Thomas joins her. They start a conversation and Adèle begins to loosen up. She learns Thomas is a senior (she's a junior, one year below) and that he hopes to study music later in life at a university. They begin to talk about music. Adèle says she loves all kinds but hard rock, as she stereotypes it as men with long hair who scream into microphones. Thomas laughs and says they apparently have a problem because he happens to like that kind of music. However, maybe it will give them an excuse to hang out again someday soon as Adèle notes, maybe the stuff he loves is different than her preconceived notions.Later, on a different day, Adèle about to cross the road when she sees a woman with blue-colored hair with her arms around another woman. As people cross the streets, Adèle turns her head to look at the woman, who in turn turns her head and smiles at Adèle. Adèle is stunned to feel a connection to a woman she has never met.Adèle then meets Thomas in order to hang out. They get lunch and talk about the book Adèle is reading for class, 'The Life of Marianne'. Adèle notes she hates when teachers over-analyze the book for her, thus taking away all the mystery and suspense. Thomas admits he hasn't read too many books but loved reading 'Dangerous Liaisons' in class since his professor was able to break down things he missed. Thomas promises to read 'The Life of Marianne' for her, as he is completely enamored with Adèle.Thomas and Adèle go to the movies. Thomas goes to hold her hand and kiss her neck and mouth. Adèle lets him a little but her heart isn't into it.That night, as she sleeps, Adèle begins to dream of the blue haired woman touching and kissing her. Adèle begins to masturbate in her sleep, touching her breasts and genitals, breathing deep. In the middle of it all, she wakes up startled. She can't believe what she was feeling.The next day, her friends want details in regards to Thomas, thinking the two slept together. Adèle denies that they did and finally leaves when she gets tired of their questions. Thomas follows into the school and asks if he did something wrong or that he went too fast because he really likes her. Adèle, desperately wanting to try and be normal with a boy who likes her, kisses him back.In the next scene Adèle and Thomas are seen in his bedroom and both of them are naked. They begin to have sex, which is apparently Adèle's first time ever. As they get into it, Adèle seems to enjoy it quite a bit. When it is over however, Adèle has a distant, detached look on her face. Perhaps, despite her desire to just be a normal girl who likes boys, it isn't enough or rather it is not the right thing for her. Thomas asks her if she is okay and if the sex was good. Adèle says that is was and kisses him. She lets him hold her.Adèle talks to her gay friend Valentin (Sandor Funtek) about unhappy she is with Thomas, because she feels as if she needs to fake it. She also notes she looks awful and Thomas would break up with her on that alone; she and Valentin joke about how this will be how her relationship ends. However, this gives her only a respite from reality. She will have to face him soon enough. Adèle smokes a cigarette at school before going to meet Thomas.In the next shot, Adèle and Thomas are sitting on a school bench. Adèle has told him that it isn't working for her but she never meant to hurt him. Thomas is visibly upset, but he lets their relationship end without any objections. He then leaves.At home later that night, Adèle cries on her bed. She is confused over her emotions, and feels awful that she hurt a boy that only liked her and did her no harm.

She lets herself get caught up in it so she can forget her problems for a while.At school, Adèle sits in a stairwell and smokes a cigarette. A young woman from her group of friends sits down next to her and bums a light from her. As another girl passes, the woman comments that the girl has a nice ass.

Adèle blushes and the young woman tilts Adèle's face her way and kisses her on the lips to Adèle's surprise.At dinner that night, Adèle's mother notices a chance in her daughter, noting that she apparently had a good day. Adèle just smiles.The next day at school after class, Adèle tracks the girl down in the ladies restroom and when no one is around, starts to kiss her. The girl however does not respond to it. The girl then tells Adèle that she didn't mean for her to get addicted to it, and her kissing Adèle was just some harmless fun, making it clear she wanted nothing more. However, she tells Adèle that nothing will change with them and she will not tell their other friends, keeping her secret. Adèle is crushed, thinking she found a potential confidant/partner.Ignoring most of her gal pals, Adèle grabs Valentin and asks to go out with him that night. Valentin takes her to a gay club, where Adèle watches gay men dance and kiss. She is bewildered by it all but also sad because she doesn't have that type of connection in her own life. Seeing a woman that looks like the blue-haired girl she saw on the street, Adèle leaves the club, following the group of women to another bar.When she gets there, she realizes it is a lesbian bar. She gets a few looks and some of the women flirt with her. Adèle is a bit embarrassed by the attention and goes up to the bar and orders a beer. Looking up to the loft area she sees the very same blue haired-woman from that day. The woman sees her too and grins. The woman comes down and after deflecting another woman from talking to Adèle, begins to chat with her. The blue-haired woman introduces herself as Emma (Léa Seydoux).Emma tells Adèle that it is obvious that she is new to the scene given that she ordered a Bulldog, which a ""dyke beer"". Emma gives her a taste of her strawberry milk drink, to which Adèle admits she finds gross. Emma tells Adèle they don't get too many of her type in the bar. Adèle asks what type she is. Emma says the underage type. Adèle asks about what Emma does for a living and Emma replies she is 22-years-old and is in her fourth year of college, studying Fine Arts. They have a discussion of the various types of art and if there is such a thing as bad art. Adèle meanwhile admits she is still in high school as well as her real age of being only 16-years-old. Emma's friends walk up and tell her they are going to another club and want her to come. Emma introduces Adèle as her cousin to them. Emma then leaves, but not before getting Adèle to tell her the name of her high school that she attends.The next day, as school lets out, Adèle is with her group of friends when she sees Emma waiting for her. Adèle goes to her, ignoring all the calls of her friends. Emma invites Adèle to come and get a drink with her. Only Valentin realizes what is really going on and watches silently as the two girls walk away.Adèle and Emma sit on a park bench. Emma is sketching her. Emma asks if she feels embarrassed, and Adèle admits she does a little as it isn't everyday that she is sketched. The two talk a bit about philosophy and Sartre. Emma discusses how she agrees with Sartre ideals of choosing your own path in life without any higher principles, as it helped her decide what she wants out of life. Adèle compares the ideals to that of Bob Marley, and how the two were both committed in their principles and ideas. Emma shows her the final product, which she admits needs work. Adèle says it is beautiful. Emma then says she needs to leave and meet her girlfriend Sabine. Adèle gives Emma her number. As they stand up to leave, Emma stares at Adèle for a long time and moves closer as if to kiss her. Emma kisses Adèle's cheek and leaves, leaving Adèle feeling happy.When Adèle gets home later, her mother tells her a friend, Emma, is on the phone. Adèle rushes up and takes the call like a nervous schoolgirl talking to her crush.The next day, Adèle is quickly and decisively confronted by her group of friends. They want to know about Emma and why Adèle is hanging around with an obvious dyke. Adèle tries to deflect their questioning, saying Emma is just a friend. However, the third degree continues and turns very ugly. They ask about her going with Valentin to a gay club, which she tries to deny then must admit is true when Valentin confirms it. It is here when things go from bad to worse. They begin to ask Adèle if she is a lesbian and pretend to say that they don't care if she is but they want her to admit it. One of her friends gets very mean saying they slept together in the same bed naked and she wants to know if Adèle ever wanted her (based on the homophobic idea that all gay people want everyone of the same sex sexually, even friends). One of the girls finally takes it too far by asking if Adèle has tasted Emma's ""blue pussy"". That sets Adèle off and she attacks the girl, having to be pulled off by Valentin. Valentin pulls Adèle away from the girls saying they know nothing as the girls scream at her. One of girls of the group tells the others they took it way too far; they meant to ask politely and they ended up verbally abusing Adèle.Adèle is in class having trouble concentrating on her studies. She is visibly upset and depressed about what happened between her and her friends.Some time later, we see Emma and Adèle at an art gallery taking in all the paintings and sculptures (it is unstated, but inferred that Emma and Sabine are no longer together). Later, they have a small picnic on a blanket in a park and discuss the art and life. Over smoking cigarettes and drinking wine from small bottles, Adèle asks when Emma first kissed a girl. Emma tells her she was 14. Adèle and Emma look into each others eyes for a long time. Then, Adèle gets closer to Emma and kisses her. Emma returns it. After a few moments, they break away and smile at each other.In the next scene, Adèle and Emma are in bed in presumably Emma's apartment. They are both naked and about to have sex for the first time. In a six-minute scene, we watch Adèle and Emma make love in a very, VERY explicit, hardcore lesbian sex scene. They take turns coupling and orally pleasuring each other which is primal and full of lust leading to both of them climaxing. When it is over, they lay in bed side by side. As Emma falls asleep, Adèle has tears in her eyes which roll down her face as she gently strokes Emma's naked body; she finally has found a sexual connection that satisfies her body and her emotions.Some months later, (during the summer season), Adèle and Emma are seen at a gay parade together. After a while, Adèle loosens up and is happy. Seeing other same sex couples show public displays of affection, Adèle kisses Emma publicly, and walks down the street with her hand-in-hand. For the first time in her life, Adèle feels free to be herself.In the next shot (another few months later during the autumn season), Adèle and Emma are passionately kissing each other on the very same park bench they sat at when Emma sketched Adèle. They are both very happy.Another several months later, Adèle and Emma are going to meet Emma's parents for dinner. Adèle brings a plant as a gift. When they get there, Adèle is introduced to Catherine, Emma's mother and Vincent, Emma's stepfather. They are aware of Emma's sexuality and have no qualms with it, and openly support and love their daughter and her romance with Adèle (Note: Adèle and Emma have been in a relationship on the sides for two years now) . They ask about Adèle's plan after school, and she says she wants to go into teaching, as her learning impacted her life for the better. Vincent and Catherine applaud her choice, while at the same time, loving the fact that Emma is in art, despite its hardships.We see Adèle and Emma having sex again (grinding) in Emma's bedroom. They never talk, but are both very passionate.Adèle arrives home some time later, but doesn't find her parents. She goes outside to the back yard to see that they threw her a surprise birthday party with all her school friends for her 18th birthday as well as her upcoming graduation from school. She is happy as they sing her a song. They eat and dance, but Adèle basically dances alone since she is not comfortable enough to be fully out with everyone, including her parents. Thus, she cannot dance with Emma.Adèle brings Emma home to have dinner with her parents one night. However, her working-class and conservative parents are clueless about their daughter's sexuality, and believe that Emma is just a friend that helped Adèle understand Philosophy better. It is clear that Emma is hurt that Adèle is lying to her folks about her, but understands why and goes along with it for her sake. Adèle's parents ask about what Emma does and mentions she works in art. Adèle's father says it must be hard to make a living, and Emma admits that is true so she is a graphic artist on the side to pay the bills. Adèle's parents ask if she has a boyfriend, and Emma lies and says she does but she is in no rush to get married. Adèle's parents laugh and say she shouldn't rush. Adèle and Emma share a knowing look.In the next scene, Adèle and Emma lay naked in Adèle's bed making love again. When they are finished, they laugh about the fact that Adèle's mother thinks Emma is sleeping in the air mattress nearby. Emma jokingly asks Adèle if she is enjoying her philosophy lessons, and gives her a grade in the subject. They giggle at their little secret and kiss. Emma tells Adèle that she loves her. Overjoyed, Adèle tells Emma that she loves her too.Chapter 2.The film re-opens four or five years later. We see Emma sketch Adèle as she lays out nude on a sofa with a cigarette dangling from her mouth. Emma's hair is now dyed blonde. Adèle and Emma live together like a committed couple.We see the first of many days of Adèle as a teacher for preschool age children. She seems to love her job. One her male colleagues ask if she wants to go out with a few others for a drink. Adèle declines saying she has plans. Adèle says that she is having a ""family dinner"". The co-worker accepts that, but says that if she never wants to hang out after work, to let him know (Note: it is implied that Adèle no longer keeps in touch with her own parents after apparently coming out to them about her sexuality which may have resulted in them severing all ties with her to express their disapproval).Emma is having an art showing of her work at her and Adèle's apartment. Adèle spends the day making the food and making sure they have enough of everything for the guests. A majority of the guests are from Emma's art crowd which makes Adèle uncomfortable as the social and intelligence gap between them bothers her. Thus, she tries to busy herself most of the time, so she doesn't have to talk to anybody and feel dumb. However, one man named Samir (Salim Kechiouche) manages to convince Adèle to sit down and talk. Samir tells her he acts in movies, usually as a stereotypical Arab terrorist and has been to New York City several times. Adèle admits she wants to go to New York and see America but hasn't had time. Samir says she should as it would change her look on life. Samir asks about Adèle liking women, and Adèle admits to him that she and Emma are a couple and this has been her first real romantic relationship with a woman. Samir acts supportive, already knowing that Emma is a lesbian.However, despite this nice conversation with Samir, Adèle is unable to talk to anyone else at the party. Also, she cannot be help notice that Emma has been very close to another woman, the pregnant Lise, who Emma introduced to her earlier. Adèle begins to think that maybe Emma is pulling away from her.Adèle cleans up after the party then heads to bed, where Emma is waiting. Emma says she thinks Adèle should do more with her writing because it is so good. Adèle however says she only writes in her diary, and she doesn't know how to convey her voice in fiction; plus she has no desire to write. Her passion is in teaching. Emma speaks of life being about creating things, building things that matter, while Adèle is more concerned with just being happy; she finds her fulfillment in being with Emma. Adèle wants to make love but Emma says they can't because she is on her period. Adèle is a little skeptical given the time of month, but just lets it go. Adèle asks about Lise. Emma tells her that Lise isn't an ex-girlfriend or anything, but is just another painter like she is.In the next scene, Adèle is at work again watching the kids have their nap time. When she gets home, there is a message on the answer machine from Emma, saying she is working late with Lise, and Adèle shouldn't wait up.Deciding not to stay at home like usual, Adèle decides to go out and get drinks with her co-workers, including the male one that kept asking. They drink and decide to dance. Adèle loosens up and seductively dances with the man. Eventually, she kisses him passionately. A combination of feeling neglected by Emma, wanting a connection, and perhaps wondering if she is fully gay has led Adèle to cheat.The next morning, Adèle listens while Emma is on the phone. Apparently, Emma is having trouble with a potential buyer who wants every detail about Emma, including her sex life in order to fully articulate her paintings. Emma tells the person on the phone she will reveal some things, but some things are to be left private. As Emma hangs up, Adèle tells her it is normal to feel tense at times about revealing her sexuality to strangers.Back at school, it is clear that Adèle's head isn't fully in her teaching as she is feeling some guilt about kissing her co-worker.Apparently going out with him again, she is given a ride home by him one night. She kisses him goodbye then pretends to head into another apartment complex before going to her real apartment. Emma is waiting for her, tense and not happy. Adèle goes up to her acting like nothing is wrong and that's when the trouble begins. Emma asks who dropped her off. Adèle first says a female colleague; she went out with co-workers and has decided to not be out with them. However, Emma knows it was a man, so Adèle is forced to change her story.Emma then reveals that she saw Adèle kiss him. Emma screams at her asking how many times she slept with the man. Adèle initially denies it, but Emma keeps going on, asking how long she has been lying to her. Adèle finally breaks down, saying she indeed slept with the male colleague a few times but it meant nothing. She just felt so alone and Emma was pulling away from her and wouldn't talk to her. Having heard this admission makes Emma completely explode and she calls Adèle a slut and tells her to get out, throwing clothes in a suitcase. Adèle pleads to let her talk about what happened but Emma won't hear it and throws her out saying that they are through. Adèle finally leaves and walks down the street into the night, completely heartbroken and sobbing uncontrollably.Adèle is back at school teaching and participating in a school stage event, but her heart it isn't it. At the end of the term, she hugs her kids goodbye. When they leave, she breaks down crying in the empty classroom.Some months later, during a summer trip with some of her students, Adèle plays with the kids on the beach. Asking for another teacher to cover for her for a few minutes, Adèle goes to take a swim in the sea. She pauses off-shore and floats on the water. The water's color is blue, like Emma's hair.Another few months later, Adèle is in class during a new school year, teaching dictation of sentences to a new group of first graders.In the next scene, Adèle is at the same park bench where she and Emma spent time together. She lies down and closes her eyes.Adèle is next seen in a seedy room of a flophouse where she now lives alone. She cries herself to sleep seemingly every night. One night as she sleeps, she jolts awake after a supposed nightmare (a deleted scene shows she dreamed about Emma and Lise having sex). Looking disheveled and fatigued, she sits up awake, chain-smoking and looking emotionally empty and desolate.Another year or two later, Adèle meets with Emma in a coffee shop. They tenderly embrace and go to sit down to catch up. Adèle is still teaching at her elementary school, and Emma is still doing art and has a few new shows coming up. Adèle says she wants to save up and buy a painting of hers. Emma says she will give her one for free, but Adèle says it is a point of principle to pay for it, to which Emma nods. Emma reveals she has been in a relationship with Lise for several years and has become a second mother to Lise's three-year-old daughter. Adèle reveals that she hasn't been in any relationship since their breakup (which was over three years ago).(Note: an implied argument can be made here that perhaps Emma had been become bored with Adèle but didn't have a good reason to end it. It is quite possible Emma cheated on Adèle with Lise. Thus, when Adèle admitted to her infidelity, it gave Emma her reason for ending their romance, hence her overly agitated response and her unwillingness to even talk to Adèle; she was projecting).Emma says that her home life with Lise is intellectually stimulating. Adèle asks about their sex life, and Emma admits it isn't like the one she had with Adèle. Adèle says it must be boring. Adèle says she misses Emma and that she wants her. Adèle slowly starts to kiss Emma's hand. When Emma doesn't respond right away, Adèle tells her to touch her and forces Emma to kiss her. Emma, clearly still attracted to Adèle to some capacity, gives in to the advances. The two kiss and caress each other longingly for a few moments, but Emma pulls away. Ashamed, Adèle apologizes and asks if she will see Emma again. To her dismay, Emma says no. She has a family now and she can't risk it. Adèle asks if Emma still loves her. Emma says that she doesn't, but she has infinite tenderness for Adèle and will remember their times together for the rest of her life. Adèle, though heartbroken, understands and tells Emma she can leave. They embrace passionately. As Emma leaves, Adèle breaks down in tears.The next scene shows Adèle back in her classroom teaching reading and writing to her young first-grade students. Adèle now wears eyeglasses and styles her long hair in a more traditional manner to make herself look older. She still appears to function well as a teacher, but now appears to be emotionally empty and unattached to anyone or anything.An unknown amount of time later, Adèle showers, puts on makeup as well as a bright-blue dress, and leaves her small apartment where she now lives to walk a few blocks to an art gallery. It is a showing of Emma's work and she has been invited for a noon showing. The two old lovers greet each other and Adèle thanks Emma for inviting her. Adèle looks at all the pieces, and is both startled and surprised to learn that she is still a muse for Emma, showing up still even in her new works. Adèle quickly becomes uncomfortable seeing her former lover, Emma, with her new lover, Lise, who is also in attendance. Although Emma acknowledges Adèle, her attention is primarily on the gallery's other guests and her current partner.Adèle bumps into Samir, and finds out he got out of acting and is now in real estate. Samir admits that this art gallery isn't his scene either. As Samir excuses himself to talk to someone, Adèle looks around and realizes a few things. One is that the incompatibility of their intellectual circles and their personal desires for life doomed her and Emma's romance long before infidelity entered the picture. Secondly, that this world of Emma's isn't a part of Adèle's anymore. She and Emma are no longer together. That chapter of her life is closed. As terrifying as it will be, Adèle realizes that she needs to move on with her life, completely away from Emma. Without saying another word to anyone, Adèle quietly leaves the gallery and walks home. Samir notices she is missing and looks outside to find her, but he misses her going around the corner and gives up his search.In the final shot, Adèle is walking down the street alone towards her home. Adèle clearly knows that this part of her life journey is over and now she must write the next chapter of her life. On that sad and ambiguous note, the film suddenly ends as calypso drums play over the closing credits."
Oldboy,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321511/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Obsessed with vengeance, a man sets out to find out why he was kidnapped and locked into solitary confinement for twenty years without reason. An advertising executive is kidnapped and held hostage for 20 years in solitary confinement. When he is inexplicably released, he embarks on an obsessive mission to discover who orchestrated his punishment, only to find he is still trapped in a web of conspiracy and torment.—FilmDistrict On a rainy night in 1993, alcohol-dependent advertising executive Joe Doucett finds himself under lock and key for no apparent reason. Confined in a seedy hotel room, Joe will spend two long and painful decades of his life trying to determine the reason behind his mysterious abduction. And then, Joe's sadistic captor inexplicably decides to release him. Now, with his pockets crammed with cash and a deadly skill set to keep him going, a baffled Doucett must embark on a risky quest for answers at all costs. As Joe unravels the mystery of his unjust confinement, one enigma at a time, he is about to discover the crushing weight of losing everything. But first things first. Who is the vicious mastermind behind Joe's endless torment?—Nick Riganas Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) is an unsympathetic marketing salesman, whose drinking and roving eye causes him to lose deals. When his estranged wife angrily calls him about missing his daughter Mia's third birthday party because he is too busy with his work, Joe angrily defends himself by saying that a three-year-old wouldn't care if he came or not. After shouting a lot of verbal abuse at his wife, he goes on a binge of drinking, vomiting and passing out, finally ending up at the bar of his old friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli). Chucky, however, refuses to let him enter in his intoxicated state. Joe sees a Korean lady with a yellow umbrella selling toys on the street, and buys a toy duck for his daughter. When Chucky exits his bar, he finds the toy on the pavement, with no sign of Joe.Joe wakes up in a small hotel room, where he is held captive. He is fed (primarily Chinese food) and provided for, but denied human contact. Every once in a while, the room is gassed so that his captors can intervene while he is unconscious. In his solitude, Joe has frequent hallucinations, and makes friends with a mouse, only to have it served to him for his next meal. Joe is allowed to watch television, and one day he sees a news broadcast that tells him that his wife has been brutally raped and murdered. Forensic evidence was lifted from him and planted on the crime scene, making him the prime suspect. Joe is devastated, but unable to do anything about it. Over the years, he learns from a crime show on TV that his daughter has been adopted by another couple, and that she has moved on with her life, becoming a celebrated cello player. Joe decides to better himself in his cell. He works out, and writes letters to his daughter, should he ever escape his prison. He carves lines in his arms for every year of imprisonment, and also makes a list of people who could be responsible for his current predicament. All the time, he is watched on camera by a man called Chaney (Samuel L. Jackson).After 20 years, Joe makes plans to escape, but is suddenly gassed and released. He wakes up with a cell phone with his daughter's picture and a countdown timer. He sees the street vendor with the umbrella who sold him the duck (or so he thinks) and chases after her, using his new physical fitness to beat up members of a football team who think he was harrassing her. Following the trail, he meets Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen), a nurse who takes care of homeless people, who senses there's something wrong with him, but he won't open up to her. She gives him her card just in case he ever needs help.He returns to his friend Chucky's bar and tells his story. He's then called by an anonymous man, who says Joe can earn forgiveness. With Chucky's help, Joe starts researching all the people he's wronged to see if he can find his captor, such as his former boss or old associates, but no one qualifies. When Joe passes out again, Chucky find's Marie's number, and she comes over to help. She finds the stack of letters Joe has written to his daughter Mia, and starts to read them. Joe wakes up and is infuriated, stating that the letters were only meant for his daughter. Mia, a former drug addict, takes pity on his situation, and agrees to help him.Joe starts sampling Chinese food at area restaurants, trying to find the same dumplings he lived on for years. After identifying the correct restaurant, he sees a man picking up a large order and follows him, armed only with a claw hammer. He locates the prison and gains entry after killing a few guards. He finds Chaney and tortures him by cutting pieces of flesh from his neck, only to find out Chaney is merely the caretaker of the facility that holds many people. Chaney gives Joe a tape with the voice of the man who ordered Joe's imprisonment. On his way out, Joe fights off numerous guards and passes out from his wounds, only to be rescued by a mysterious stranger who drops him off back at Chucky's.Joe recovers and gets another call from the stranger, who taunts him a bit further. Afterwards, Joe notices that the call was not blocked, and calls back: the recipient is one of the clients in Chucky's bar, accompanied by a female bodyguard. Joe furiously attacks, but the bodyguard subdues him. The stranger is a man called Adrian (Sharlto Copley), who challenges Joe to find out who he is and why he had Joe imprisoned. Adrian offers him proof of Adrian's involvement in the murder of Joe's wife, a fully signed confession and a suitcase full of diamonds if Joe succeeds. Most importantly, Adrian will bring Joe to his daughter, and then kill himself if Joe finds out the truth. He then leads Joe to Marie's house, where Chaney's gang is ready to violently rape her. They beat up Joe, but before Chaney can start torturing him, Adrian gives him a call, and pays him off.Marie is badly shaken, but still determined to help. She uses a Shazam app to find out that the ringtone of Joe's phone is the anthem of his old prep school. Suspecting that the old school is key to solving the riddle, she and Joe leave by car, but Adrian keeps close watch on them.Joe and Marie track down Edwina Burke (Linda Emond), the headmistress of Joe's old prep school. While Marie distracts her, Joe sneaks into the apartment. Marie tries to convince Ms Burke that Joe may be innocent, and someone from his old school may try to frame him for the murder of his wife. She learns that Joe met his future wife at the school, but that he was a very selfish student, so he may have made some enemies there. Joe finds Adrian's name and picture in a yearbook, proving that he was in the same year as Joe and Chucky. The school is closed now, but all the paperwork is still there. Joe and Marie go there, but find the gate locked, so they decide to come back later in the evening.In the meanwhile, Chucky does some internet searching, and learns that Adrian once had a hospital built in dedication to his dead sister. Suddenly remembering something, he calls Joe and leaves a message, stating that it is all about ""the whore"". Unfortunately, Adrian intercepts the message. Enraged by how Chucky calls his sister, he goes over to the bar and kills Chucky.Joe and Marie go into a motel to tend after Joe's wounds, and they end up making love. They are unaware that Adrian watches via a camera. That evening, Joe and Marie break into the prep school, finding evidence that Adrian and his sister enrolled there. After hearing Chucky's message, Joe remembers that in his bullying days, he used to harrass Adrian's sister. Later, during a school party, he witnessed Adrian's sister having sex with a man in the garden. He simply assumed it was a teacher at the school, and had mentioned the girl's promiscuous reputation to Chucky. In the school's library, Joe and Marie research newspaper articles. Apparently, Adrian and his wealthy family moved to Luxemburg within a year, where a great tragedy happened that killed the entire family, but left Adrian severely wounded. Joe identifies the man who was having sex with Adrian's sister as the girl's own father. Outside the prep school, Joe and Marie find a box in their car, which contains Chucky's severed tongue. Shocked, they return to the motel. Joe received a picture on his phone of Mia, badly bruised. Joe leaves Marie in safety, and leaves to confront Adrian, despite Marie's pleas not to go.Joe goes to Adrian and after a short fight with his bodyguard (whom he kills), he tells Adrian that he solved his riddle: Adrian blames Joe for the tragedy that befell his family, and therefore imprisoned him. It wasn't until this evening that Joe realized that the sex scandal involved an incestuous relation. Adrian responds that it runs even deeper than that: his beloved father was a pedophile who had separate sexual relationships with both him and his sister. They were very happy with it, but when the sex scandal spread throughout the school, the sister's reputation was destroyed, so they were forced to move to Luxemburg. Finally, the father killed his wife, daughter and himself, leaving Adrian severely wounded. Adrian says that he lost everything as a consequence of Joe's actions, but keeps his promise and takes Joe to see Mia.Joe learns that the crime show he saw on TV during his imprisonment was staged, and shown only to him. The 'Mia' he saw in that show is a professional actress, recruited by Adrian from a young age (even the last picture of her bruised face was faked). Joe is furious and physically assaults Adrian, forcing him to take him to his real daughter. Adrian simply comments that Joe never asked the right question: instead of asking why he was imprisoned, he should have asked why he was set free. Adrian then continues to show pictures of the real Mia. Adrian had made sure that she was raised after her mother's death, and grew up as Marie! He staged everything so that she would get addicted and develop a father complex, so that when she met Joe, she would take pity on him, finally culminating in the two having sex as a torture to Joe.Joe is devastated by the news, as Adrian picks up his phone in order to call Marie. Joe pleads with Adrian not to reveal the information to Marie, instead offering himself to Adrian to do as he pleases. Adrian simply states that he has no desire to kill Joe, since he has Joe exactly in the position where he always wanted him, so that he could feel Adrian's pain. With his revenge complete, Adrian shoots himself.Joe uses Adrian's diamonds to try and make things right - with Marie/Mia and even Chaney, offering him money and arranging to be re-imprisoned. Joe sends Marie a letter along with some of the diamonds and the duck toy, stating that he has done something terrible; she should forget about him and try to find her happiness again. Joe finds himself back in his old prison, with a mysterious grimace on his face. End."

Krishna immediately changes himself to Krrish and saves the plane from accident by holding the component to make tyres free to roam.
A few days later, Rohit hears about a deadly disease spreading in the African country of Namibia due to a virus whose antidote has not yet been discovered. He consults his friend Dr. Varun Shetty (Arif Zakaria) about the situation. Meanwhile, Shetty receives a phone call from Dr. Alok Sen (Asif Basra), a scientist working for Kaal Laboratories who insists on meeting him in order to reveal information about an antidote to the virus. Both Sen and Shetty are, however, murdered by Kaya (Kangna Ranaut), a form-changing female mutant. She is the henchwoman of Kaal (Vivek Oberoi), a handicapped evil genius who possess telekinetic powers. Kaal creates a team of ""maanvars"" (an hybrid of humans and animals) with distinct physical powers in order to cure himself but fails. Later it is revealed the virus in Africa was spread by Kaal himself to incur huge profits by selling its antidote, the singular source of which is his blood.
Rohit discovers that the virus, which is fast spreading through Mumbai, has no effect on Krishna, the pregnant Priya or himself. He, thus, makes an antidote by using the blood from Krishna's bloodstream which he spreads with the help of explosions. An enraged Kaal sends his mutants to attack Rohit and find out how an antidote was developed without using his own blood. Krrish manages to save Rohit, but Priya is injured and hospitalised. Krrish, however, manages to defeat the mutant Striker (Gowhar Khan). Kaya, carrying out Kaal's instructions, takes Priya's form while Priya is kidnapped by Kaal. In the form of Priya, Kaya lets Krishna belief that Priya has lost her child, and continues to live with the Mehras. While finding the truth behind the antidote's formula she develops an attraction towards Krishna. Failing to get answers about Frog Man's involvement with the virus attack, Rohit travels to Singapore to seek answers from Dr. Siddhant Arya's (Naseeruddin Shah) partner, where he is kidnapped by Kaal's men. Meanwhile, Krishna discovers the true identity of Priya; furious, he reveals himself as Krrish to Kaya and orders her to take him to Kaal's laboratory. Having fallen in love with Krishna, Kaya decides to help rescue his wife.
At Kaal's laboratory, it is revealed that Kaal is Rohit's son, who was created by an experiment conducted by Dr. Arya while Rohit was held hostage by him. The child was born handicapped, and was thus given away to an orphanage from where he was adopted by a wealthy man (Mohnish Behl). Kaal uses Rohit's bone marrow to successfully cure his handicap. Meanwhile, Kaya saves Priya and unites her with Krrish; she is, however, murdered by Kaal for her disloyalty. Kaal subsequently murders Krrish, and dons a metal suit. Deeply disturbed by his son's death, Rohit decides to re-use his failed experiment to bring dead tissues to life in order to save Krishna. This time, however, he absorbs the excess energy himself. Though the process kills Rohit, it transfers his powers to a revived Krishna. Meanwhile, Kaal threatens to destroy the city of Mumbai if Priya does not surrender to him. Krrish re-emerges and, after several unsuccessful attempts, manages to kill him using Rohit's solar experiment. The film ends six months later with Priya naming their new-born son Rohit, who also exhibits superpowers."

He is interrupted by Ian (Anton Yelchin), who has brought him several guitars which he is very happy with, and pays him a large wad of cash. Ian asks if he needs anything else, and Adam replies that he wants a wooden bullet. Ian asks to use the bathroom but Adam says it's out of order and offers him to piss in the garden instead.
Adam travels to the local hospital disguised as a doctor, to collect bottles of O negative blood from an understandably paranoid doctor. (Jeffrey Wright)
On the other side of the world in exotic Tangier, Morocco, Eve walks through town to meet Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt), who has brought her some blood from a French doctor - ""the good stuff"".
Adam and Eve return to their respective homes and enjoy their blood from ornate glasses.
Eve calls Adam, who takes a moment to connect his computer, Tv and phone to be able to see Eve during the call. Clearly enamoured with one another, Eve enquires about Adam's life, his supplies, his music and is concerned as he looks tired and something is troubling him. He replies it's because the zombies (humans) are destroying the planet.
Eve reluctantly agrees to come and visit him , reluctant because she hates the travel.
Adam plays music while Eve reads books and prepares for her travels. When saying goodbye to Marlowe, he warns her to be careful of contaminated blood, and mentions he had a dream about her sister, Ava.
Adam's music is interrupted by kids ringing his doorbell, who are possibly fans of his. He is then visited by Ian who has obtained the wooden bullet. Adam mentions the fans bothering him, and Ian promises to try and throw them off the track and spread rumours that Adam lives elsewhere. After Ian leaves, Adam loads his gun with the wooden bullet and holds it at his chest.
Finally Eve arrives, and the pair lovingly, tenderly and passionately reunite.
Adam and Eve share happy times together going out for drives, listening to Adam's music and playing chess, during which Eve playfully distracts Adam long enough to beat him ruthlessly, and they share ice blocks made of O negative.
At one point the power goes out in the house, and Adam goes outside to fix his impressive home made generator, displaying his vast knowledge of science and electricity, and also disgust with the way humans use and abuse it.
Adam mentions to Eve that he has had a dream about Ava, also implying he does not have a very high opinion of her.
He then leaves to go to the hospital to pick up more blood, during which time Eve discovers his gun with the new wooden bullet.
When Adam returns, Eve questions him about the bullet, and then points the gun on herself. Adam is horrified and scolds her for mucking around. Eve makes an impassioned plea that even though Adam has been around for ages, he still doesn't get it. She urges him to appreciate life more, especially dancing. She then puts a record on and they share a tender dance together.
Out on another drive together, Eve reveals that she has also dreamt about Ava, as did Marlowe. When they return home, there are lights on and Adam's music is playing. Ava (Mia Wasikowska) is sleeping on the lounge. When she wakes up she is excited to see them, but Adam is less than thrilled. Clearly irritating him and disturbing their peaceful idyllic life, Ava drinks too much of their blood supplies, watches annoying YouTube videos and finally convinces Adam and Eve to go out. They go to a music club with Ian, who is thrilled that Adam has left the house, and who Ava immediately takes a shine to. At the club, Adam is enjoying the music until Ava produces a flask of blood, having discovered his hiding spot, and then suddenly Adam's music is played in the club, and Ava is dancing suggestively with Ian, so the foursome abruptly leave.
Back at Adam's place, Ava tries to keep the party going, and get Adam to play his music, but he's not having it. He suggests that Ian leave, but Ava says he will just finish his drink first. Adam and Eve go to bed, and Eve agrees that she needs to tell Ava to leave.
When they wake up, Eve goes to check on Ava and is horrified to discover she has drunk Ian and he is dead. Adam is also unimpressed to lose his only human friend. They kick Ava out into the street and she angrily swears at them as she walks away.
Realising that they were all seen together at the club, Adam and Eve dispose of Ian's body in a pool of acid, and then book a flight to Tangier. Adam wants to bring his instruments but Eve assures him the world is full of them. He also wants to bring blood, but she says they will get some from Marlowe as soon as they arrive.

They gather around his bedside and watch him take his last breath, and then mourn him.
Adam comforts Eve who then decides to buy Adam a present. Leaving him to wait while she does so, he hears a female singer at a nearby club and walks over to watch her. He is very taken with her performance.

Then, the Emperor of Japan proposes to her.—Anonymous Deep into a swaying and lush bamboo forest, Okina, an elderly farmer, stumbles upon a mysteriously glowing bamboo stalk, that from within, a minuscule fairy-like creature enfolded in a royal robe sprouts before his amazed eyes. Without delay, the ageing man rushes to his wife, Ona, only to witness, much to their surprise, the tiny nymph transform into a baby. In the end, as the infant grows exponentially into a fine girl, the humble couple will take her to the capital, Kyoto, to make her an aristocratic and well-mannered lady worthy of Japan's most powerful suitors. But is this Princess Kaguya's fate?—Nick Riganas One day while working amid a grove of bamboo near his home in the countryside, an old bamboo cutter comes across a glowing tree. Moving closer, a bamboo shoot sprouts before him, revealing a girl within, mere inches high! The woodcutter, taking in the strange sight, assumes that she is a divine being, and decides to take care of her. Carefully taking her back to his home, the cutter and his wife are soon shocked when the miniature girl turns into a baby before their eyes, and over the course of days (or weeks), grows into a young girl!Some village children near the couple also take note of the young girl's appearance and growth, and given her penchant for growth, nickname her 'little bamboo.' However, the cutter and his wife refer to her as 'princess.'The little girl is enamored with much of the countryside, and soon befriends the children, including an older member of their group, named Sutemaru.The cutter continues to collect bamboo, but one day just like before, he comes across a glowing bamboo shoot.Cutting into it, he is surprised to find it contains gold! Another shoot he cuts down, brings forth several billowing robes. Taking them, the woodcutter tells his wife that he believes they are signs from above, that are directing them to raise the princess in a proper manner.Over the course of several years, the cutter takes the gold into the capital, until one day, he and his wife declare to their daughter that she is to come with them, and leave their home.On their journey, the princess is placed into a covered carriage, and soon awakening from sleep, finds herself in a grand palace within the capital, where her mother and father claim, she is to be raised as a Princess! Though she is at first happy and enthralled with the new place and her things, she is soon set upon to carry herself like a Princess.Taking lessons from Lady Sagami, the Princess treats her lessons almost as a joke, but when her parents inquire as to them, she seems to do what she is asked with no signs of these transgressions.Eventually, the wood cutter is informed by his wife that the Princess has 'come of age,' and delightedly, sends for a royal priest to give her a proper naming. The girl's father is at first upset when the priest's first impression of the girl, is of her crawling around, playing with a cat, but the priest claims his viewing of the girl without all the necessary garb, has allowed him to come up with a proper name for her. Given the demeanor and playfulness he saw in her, the priest dubs her, Princess Kaguya.Her father then calls for a party to celebrate her naming, though Kaguya grows bored that even though it is a party for her, she can't be seen. As well, her thoughts to maybe invite some of the children from her old village is denied by her father.The party lasts over 3 days, while Kaguya is confined to her chambers. As several of the partygoers continue to drink on into the latter days, a look desperation passes over her face hearing some claim she and her parents are not nobility.Suddenly, she bolts from her room, her expensive robes flying off, as she runs back towards the small mountain area where she grew up. However, she finds another family living in the hut she grew up in, and the forested area now all gone. She finds a man sealing up a hovel, claiming that those who once lived there have moved away, with plans to come back in 10 years. The belief is that 10 years should be enough time for the forest on the mountainside to replenish from the woodcutting that took place. Kaguya then trudges back towards the capital, but in the fallen snow, she passes out......only to awaken back in her room, unsure if what she experienced was real, or a dream.Following her party, the Princess is soon set upon by numerous invitations to marry, but she does not return the favor to any. Eventually, the royal priest who gave her her name, is in counsel with several noblemen. Though they of course scoff at her seemingly country 'heritage,' the priest's description of her beauty and charm, soon sends 5 of the noblemen tearing towards her palace, eager to wed her. Kaguya is prepared to reject them as well, but is talked into hearing each of them out by her father, and Lady Sagami.Each man is given a chance to speak to Kaguya (who sits behind a blind, hidden from view). One-by-one, they compare her (unseen) beauty to rare treasures. Among these, are the stone bowl of Buddha, a jeweled branch from the island of Horai, a robe of fire-rat fur, a jewel from the dragon's neck, and the cowry shell of the swallows.Kaguya listens to all these things, and then decrees that if she is as beautiful as these things, then her suitors should bring them to her. Each of them balks at this, but the Princess decrees this is how she will decide. This leads each of the suitors to leave, and Lady Sagami takes her leave as well, feeling that the Princess' actions have doomed her from ever finding a suitable husband in high society.Eventually, spring comes, and the Princess wishes to see the cherry blossoms bloom. Her mother and one of her handmaidens take her back to the country, where not far from the hut she once lived, a tree is in bloom. Reveling in its bursting forth with life, she happily whirls amid its petals, until she accidentally stumbles across a small child. The family of the child quickly takes it away, bowing in her presence...reminding the Princess of who/what she is now.Returning to the capital, the cart the group is in finds itself stuck, when a ruckus is heard outside. Kaguya notices several men running through the streets, and upon seeing one of them, recognizes Sutemaru! Unable to contain herself, she cries out to him, but upon realizing her station in life, quickly retreats into the carriage as it drives off. Sutemaru attempts to go after her, but is beaten for his attempts, as Kaguya cries.In the time after the suitors and the country visit, Kaguya takes refuge in a small garden area where her mother tends. Kaguya asks for a portion for herself, and here, she seems to find solace amid the nature.One day, after several years, the family receives shocking news when the second suitor, claims he has returned with a jeweled branch from Horai. Still hidden, Kaguya asks how he came by it, and the suitor spins a story...that is soon interrupted when a group of craftsman come, looking to collect for fabricating the branch.Shortly afterwards, the fourth suitor comes, claiming he has acquired a robe of fire-rat fur. Kaguya requests that he burn it, as the fire-rat fur will not catch fire. The suitor nervously places the robe over a flame, and as suspected, it disintegrates.The first suitor then comes, claiming that while he didn't find Buddha's bowl, he offers the Princess a flower, claiming that its beauty reminded her of him. However, the Princess has one of the servants put in her place, when the Prince pulls back the curtain, with the woman claiming the Prince is still a careless individual.The Princess tries to put thoughts of the suitors out of her head, until word reaches her of the two others: one who has gone to sea, looking for the jewel of the dragon's neck, and another who has died from a fall, in his attempts to get the cowry shell of a swallow.The thought that someone has died because of her, sends the girl into a state of despair, causing her to tear into the garden area she has cultivated, and spending quiet hours working a loom in the small hut nearby.Eventually, word comes that the Emperor himself has heard of the girl's beauty, and wishes to reward her father with a royal title if she marries him. Kaguya's father happily relays the news, but she tells him to deny the request. Her father claims that one does not do so, but Kaguya claims that if her father accepts the request, she will kill herself.The denial soon makes the Emperor all the more curious, and he visits the family's palace himself. He at first talks to the Princess just like the previous suitors, but soon, sneaks through the room where she is and embraces her. This causes her to suddenly disappear from his arms. The Emperor promises that he meant no harm, and that if the Princess shows herself, he'll leave. Kaguya does appear, but when he tries to move closer to her, she withdraws. The Emperor leaves, claiming she will be in his thoughts.After this, Kaguya reveals a secret to her parents. In truth, she is actually a being from the moon, who came to Earth all those years ago. She had heard of those who had also come to Earth many times before, including one who sang a song that she did not understand...but now having spent time on Earth, its words have become clearer.Kaguya also explains that when the Emperor made his advances on her, she wishes to return to the Moon: a request that cannot be broken. As such, a procession will come for her on the fifteenth night.Kaguyas father then recruits a small army, and prepares the palace to defend against whatever the Moon may send. In the meantime, Kaguya, her mother, and a handmaiden have once again returned to the countryside. Kaguya once again finds solace amid the greenery, but is surprised to find Sutemaru there, having returned to rebuild their village now that nature has returned.Sutemaru claims he is surprised to see Kaguya there, since she is a Princess now. Even so, Kaguya claims that the title doesn't matter, and that in truth, she feels that a life in the country with Sutemaru would have made her happier. This declaration makes Sutemaru declare that he'd be willing to run away with her, and start life anew. Taking each other's hand, the two run through the fields, before suddenly taking flight, over the lands where they once grew up as children. However, as the sky turns to night, and the full moon draws near, Kaguya begs Sutemaru to hold her tightly. However, she falls from his grasp, and plunges into the waters below...when Sutemaru wakes up, not sure if what he experienced was a dream, or not. He is then drawn back to the others, when his wife and child call to him.Meanwhile, Kaguya has returned to the palace, where her father and a group of soldiers wait. On the 15th, a procession descends down from the moon, playing a soothing celebratory song. Numerous archers fire arrows at them, that then turn into flowers. The procession flies over the palace walls, where its melody then puts almost everyone there to sleep, except for Kaguya's parents. As her mother watches in horror, Kaguyaa suddenly rises up, and is drawn towards the procession. Both of the girl's parents rush to her, begging procession not to take her back. However, a member of the procession begins to place a crown and robes on her: clothing that once fully applied, will wipe all traces of her time on Earth, from her memory.However, as the robe is about to be applied, one of Kaguya's handmaidens appears, with a small procession of children, singing a song. This snaps Kaguya from her trance, and she embraces her parents in tears, before claiming that even with the hardships, there is still good and wonder within the world. However, her protestations do no good, as the robe is put on her, and here eyes go blank.The Princess is then walked into the procession, turning her back to her parents, as the procession then heads back to the moon.Across the land, we see a number of people looking to the sky. From Sutemaru, to the suitors, and even the Emperor, all seem transfixed by its glow.We then see Kaguya, traveling closer to the moon. However, before she reaches it, she looks back one last time at the Earth, before the procession disappears into the glow of the moon."

Joe gets the idea to remove himself from his father's home, and build a house in the woods with his best buddy Patrick(Gabriel Basso, also having parent issues). Joe, though being skeptical of Biaggio, can't ask him to leave as he is too shy of it. Hence Biaggio sticks along with them.

Stalingrad has become hell and paradise for those who were worthy of awards, but the only reward they managed to get was love.

A few soldiers who managed to get to the other side take refuge in a house on the bank of Volga. Here they find a girl who didn't escape when the Germans came. This Russian film is mis understood because of its grand title,its much more, though not in a violent sense.Yes, it has scenes of bloody action,what film about urban warfare wouldnt ? However at its heart,its a film of rebirth in violent times,what could be more topical today?
Beginning in the turmoil of the Fukushima disaster, a Russian rescue team is trying to save some trapped young German girls in whats left of a buildings rubble.Therein starts a flashback retelling of a band of Russian soldiers and a girl mixed in with a German officer and his forced young Russian girl lover,both squaring off over a building in rubble.Ah symmetry and could be corny right ? WRONG !!! Perhaps its being forced to read those subtitles,it is in Russian spoken word,that invests you in the story.It brings to mind two other films,Enemy at the gates,and Miracle at St. Anna,however a far more intense experience for me.
Not wanting to tell much more,it is a rich emotional portrait of simple lives in the middle of all encompassing war.If you just want bang for your buck,you might be disappointed as there are films with more mindless violence BUT if you a story of hope in the middle of despair THEN enjoy."

Raanjhanaa,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2359810/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Kundan, the son of a Hindu pundit, discovers that his childhood sweetheart Zoya loves city-bred Akram and wants to marry him. However, he persistently seeks to win her heart. Pundit's son Kundan (Dhanush) has fallen for a girl at first sight. That they're both kids makes us dismiss it as a meaningless crush. But a few years later, the boy is still in love with the girl, Zoya (Sonam Kapoor). When she's in school, he follows her around holding her hand and getting slapped in the process. Finally, she relents because of his ""consistency"". The film shifts cities when Zoya gets into JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University), and through her, we are introduced to the place's idealistic and political culture. She discovers a long-lost strength as she confronts, then falls for, student leader Akram (Abhay Deol). Zoya returns to her hometown after eight long years only to find some things changed and others surprisingly the same.—Sonia Chopra A small town man, deeply loves a girl since childhood, but eventually finds his love unreciprocated. Later, in the heat of a moment, his action leads to a terrible event, which he tries to atone for, and eventually finds peace and forgiveness.—Abhay Bhatt Kundan Shankar (played by Dhanush) is a strong believer of God and the son of a Tamil priest. Since his childhood days, Kundan has had a strong one-sided love for Zoya Haider (played by Sonam Kapoor), a Muslim girl residing in Varanasi whose father is a professor. Being kids and having crushes makes it pointless but a few years later, Kundan is steadfast in his love for Zoya. When she is at school, he always attempts to be around her and hold her hand but gets slapped several times in the process. Zoya finally changes her mind because of Kundan's constancy of affection and attraction. Zoya's family is orthodox, preventing the lovers from being together. By the time Zoya moves to Aligarh for her further studies, Kundan harmonizes with Zoya's family, assisting them with various works especially pertaining to house. The film shifts its center when Zoya gets into Jawaharlal Nehru University and through her, the idealistic and political culture of the Delhi is explored. She discovers a long-lost strength as she confronts and then falls for student leader Jasjeet Singh Shergill (disguised as Akram Zaidi as Zoya wanted him to be accepted by her family; played by Abhay Deol) in Delhi.After a period of eight years, Zoya returns to Varanasi. Kundan again attempts to ask Zoya for her love but she is reluctant, revealing that she is in love with Akram. Zoya then urges Kundan to convince her family about her marriage with Akram. Initially refusing the plans because he still loves her, Kundan eventually agrees to it. Kundan gets his work done and the wedding of Zoya and Akram is arranged. Kundan promises Zoya that he will also tie the knot with another girl and will forget her. Kundan proposes to his childhood friend Bindiya (Swara Bhaskar), who has had a crush on Kundan since their childhood days, for marriage.On the day of their marriage, Kundan finds out through a newspaper article that Akram is a Sikh, whose actual name is Jasjeet Singh Shergill. This enrages Kundan as Zoya had used their religious differences to convince him that their match was not possible. In a separate flashback it is shown that Zoya, despite Jasjeet's misgivings about the plan, convinced him to portray himself as Muslim to marry her. Enraged again, Kundan reveals everything to Zoya's parents thereby interrupting their marriage ceremony. Later, Kundan is informed by his friend that Zoya tried to commit suicide and is in a critical condition. He rushes to the hospital where he is also informed that Jasjeet was mercilessly beaten by Zoya's relatives and is also critical. Later Jasjeet's parents take him back to his village and thank Kundan for helping him. Kundan tries to redeem himself by taking Zoya to Jasjeet's village. However, he is devastated to find that Jasjeet has succumbed to injuries, finally making Kundan understand that his one-sided love has resulted in an innocent man's death. Kundan also forgets about his own marriage with Bindiya, which was supposed to happen the same day as that of Zoya and Jasjeet. For this reason, Kundan's family disowns him.Kundan then becomes homeless and begins visiting various religious places and volunteering in their activities so that he can atone for his sins. During one such visit to the banks of Ganga, a man advises him to do the right thing rather than running away from his sins.Motivated, Kundan locates Zoya to Jawahar Lal Nehru University, where she is spearheading the activities of the political party ""All India Citizen Party"" (AICP), created by Jasjeet. Kundan joins the nearby canteen and serves the people of the party, all the while trying to get Zoya's attention. Over time, Kundan becomes popular among the party due to his simple nature. In between Kundan also helps the party in negotiating some tough situations by using his simple yet witty tricks. Slowly, he emerges as a popular face of the party, disturbing Zoya. She holds a grudge that the person who is responsible for Jasjeet's death is now taking his place. She also tries to instigate party members against Kundan but Jasjeet's sister Rashmi (played by Shilpi Marwaha), who is also Zoya's best friend, tells Kundan to continue, as he is the best choice for fulfilling Jasjeet's dreams.Kundan, however, only wants Zoya to forgive him. He silently follows Zoya's instructions despite them resulting in harm coming to him. The Chief Minister (played by Sujata Kumar) tells Zoya she must seek revenge on Kundan so as to take the place Jasjeet/Akram held for the AICP. To get back the position, she tells her to let Kundan get injured as he delivers his campaign speech for the party. Zoya gets brainwashed by this plan and as the Chief Minister desired, Kundan is hurt badly and sent to ICU, thus fulfilling Zoya's revenge.Zoya slowly begins to understand the extent of Kundan's love and at a press meet following Kundan's injury, reveals that the plan was plotted by her and the Chief Minister. Zoya leaves the press meet in agony and finds out through a policeman that Kundan was aware of the plot and still let himself be injured. Shocked by this fact and ultimately realizing her love for Kundan, she rushes to the hospital to finally confess her feelings to him. However, Kundan dies.
In a final voice over, Kundan says he can be born again and again in the same Benaras with the same surroundings, fall in love with a girl like Zoya again, and become a Raanjhaana with her love."
Nymphomaniac: Vol. I,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1937390/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A self-diagnosed nymphomaniac recounts her erotic experiences to the man who saved her after a beating. A man named Seligman finds a fainted wounded woman in an alley and he brings her home. She tells him that her name is Joe and that she is nymphomaniac. Joe tells her life and sexual experiences with hundreds of men since she was a young teenager while Seligman tells about his hobbies, such as fly fishing, reading about Fibonacci numbers or listening to organ music.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film starts with a repetitive sound effect in the dark. Its finally revealed to be machinery pounded by rainfall. After several minutes of this, we see an unmoving hand on the pavement.The peaceful sounds of the wind and rain is taken over by loud heavy metal music on the soundtrack. We see inside someone's house. The man (Stellan Skarsgård) puts on a scarf and goes on a walk. He picks up some bait from a tackle store, then makes his way home. He stumbles upon what is revealed to be an unconscious middle-aged woman (Charlotte Gainsbourg) on the ground. He wakes her up; she is badly beaten and bloody. He tells her to lie still and hell get an ambulance. She tells him 'no', she doesn't need an ambulance and if he calls for one or the police, she will leave before he can return. He points out she is hurt and asks if she wants anything and she asks for a cup of tea and milk. He takes her inside his home.Inside, she drinks some tea. He tells her he will wash her clothes; she asks him not to wash the coat. He asks what happened and asks if she was robbed. She says it's her fault because she's a bad human being. He asks her if she wants to talk about it. She says she doesn't know were to start and then notices he has a fly on a fishhook, on the wall. He tells her about fly-fishing, how the fly resembles something the fish like to eat and because its light, the line has to be heavy. She asks if he fishes a lot and he says he doesn't catch much. He tells her he used to love a fishing book as a kid, The Complete Angler, which was a romantic Bible to him. She then realizes she knows where to start and says shell have to tell him the whole, long story.CHAPTER ONE: THE COMPLETE ANGLERThe woman explains that she discovered her bait, her cunt, as a two year old. Five years later, she and her girl friend, B, lock themselves in the bathroom, take off their underwear, fill the floor with water, then slide around, rubbing themselves on the floor. The girl's mother, Katherine (Connie Nielsen), knocks on the door and the young girls quickly mop up. The woman says she loved her father, a doctor, very much but her mother was a cold bitch who always had a bad turn when she played Solitaire. In P.E., the narrator enjoyed climbing the rope for the sensation of it hanging between her legs. She says the only difference between her and other people is she always demanded more from the sunset, more spectacular colors when the sun hit the horizon. In present day, she says that's perhaps her only sin. He asks why shes suggesting children are sinful; she corrects him, she is not claiming children are, only her. He says he doesn't see sin anywhere in her story but hes not religious; she says its because he doesn't know the rest of the story and shes not religious either. He asks why she would take the most unsympathetic aspect of religion, the concept of sin, and let it survive beyond religion.She continues the story. As a young girl (10 years old), the girl casually looks up body parts in an anatomy book while her father (Christian Slater) observes. The two go out on a walk. He tells her a story about how the ash tree made all the other trees in the forest jealous because it was so beautiful and flawless; but in the winter, when it lost all of its leaves, the other trees noticed the ash trees black buds and started laughing, saying Look, the ash tree has had its fingers in the ashes. She loves hearing his stories so much, she sometimes pretends she has forgotten them so he will tell them again.In present day, the man explains the fly on the wall is called a nymph and is the early stage of an insect. She explains that, as a young nymph, it was imperative of her to get rid of her virginity. She knew a boy at 15 who had a moped, so therefore she considered him sophisticated. She visits him; (it is revealed to be a young Shia LaBeouf). She asks him point blank to take her virginity. He agrees. Beforehand, he works on his moped and realizes its not working. He requests she takes off her knickers and then he humps her three times. We see a graphic counting to the number 3. She is then turned over and he humps her 5 times in the ass (we see 3 + 1, then + 2, + 3, + 4, + 5, so a graphic remains on the screen 3 + 5). They both put their clothes back on. He struggles to get his moped to work again; she makes one quick adjustment and it starts up right away. She has to waddle home, explaining she never forgot those two humiliating numbers 3+5.In present day, the man points out that those are Fibonacci numbers. She says it hurt so bad, she swore shed never sleep with anyone again but that didn't last long. A couple of years later, the teenaged girl, who now calls herself Joe (Stacy Martin), is with her friend B (Sophie Kennedy Clark) and they break open B's brothers piggy bank and put on clothes called ""fuck me now"" clothes. This is interspersed with shots of the fly (bait). They go on a train trip without buying tickets; the one who fucks the most men by the time they reach the destination will win a bag of chocolate sweets.The two walk past all the compartments, eyeing all the men. In present day, the man says they were reading the river. Most of the large fish stay sheltered from the current to save energy and to hide from the prey. Where the fish hides entails a very complicated hierarchy. The topography decides where the most attractive hiding spots are and the biggest fish choose the best positions.B tells Joe to ask a lot of Wh-- questions to engage the men in conversation. Joe goes into the first compartment. A family with a man, woman, and boy are on one side; a man beside her. She asks her first Wh-questions; ""What time is it?"" The father tells her. B walks by with her first conquest. Joe continues, ""Where do you come from?"" The son responds, ""From home"". ""Who knows where the lavatory is?"" The father points out that there are lavatories in both directions. The man besides Joe tells her hell show her where the lavatory is. A shot of a fly-fisherman reeling in a fish. The man and her have sex in the bathroom.Joe explains that it was shockingly easy. Eventually, B is ahead, 5 to 3. All they had to do was look them in the eye and smile. But suddenly, the conquests stopped. The man explains that it happens in fishing, too either none of the fish are feeding or they're all feeding at the same time. They go into feeding frenzy. Fish most rarely bite at the beginning of a light rain because they feel safe when they swim in the stream because they cant be seen from above.Joe explains then it started again a bit more slowly. The man says, yes, fly-fishing can be done in several stages. And if the fish stop biting, you move on to phase two. You not only imitate an insect but an insect in trouble; you pull the line irregularly so the fish thinks its dealing with an easy prey. And then let the fly drift down the river and then halfheartedly make a few jumps.Joe goes into a compartment. She pretends to be upset; she explains that Betsy is very ill. The two men ask who Betsy is and she says her dwarf hamster. In real time, Joe explains that she did have a dwarf hamster as a child but never liked it. One man is more sympathetic than the other. He takes her hand. She asks him to show him the lavatory. The man has sex with her while she looks on, uninterested.B and Joe were running out of subjects and B is ahead on points. They go to a first class compartment. A train conductor asks for tickets. Joe checks her purse and tells him she thinks she lost hers. B says she hasn't bought a ticket for ""the shitty train"" and its ""too slow"". He gives them a ticket that would require £8 (pounds) but B tears it up, along with a second one he issues. The man in the compartment with them pays for their tickets. The conductor leaves. B says they'd like to be nice to him the way he has to them but he refuses her sexual advances.The scoreboard now reads 10 for B and 6 for Joe. B says shell give Joe five extra points if she can get the first class passenger in the lavatory. The fisherman compares this to resorting to using a red wobbler when a fly has failed to work.Joe asks the man why he brought a gift; he says it's for his wife. She points out he travels first class but has bought the gift from the station. He explains that they have been trying to have a child and it has to happen now or never. His wife just started ovulating and all signs point to maximum fertility being tonight. So he is rushing home in attempt to get her pregnant. Now Joe realizes why he didn't have sex with B and her. However, she still approaches him and tries to seduce him. He begs her to stop but she doesn't; she performs fellatio on him without permission and he orgasms in her mouth. She feels no remorse for forcing him to orgasm and at the train stop later, she happily eats from the bag of chocolates.The fisherman is impressed that oral sex because her angler. She asks why he isn't disgusted by her reprehensible actions. He says the only thing she's done is give people an experience to remember and releasing the married man from his load; if you keep the load too long, the sperm will die or degenerate. Maybe thanks to her, the man now has a child. She tells him she discovered her power as a woman and used it without any concern for others. He tells her, ""if we have wings, not why fly?""The man leaves the room for more tea. When he comes back, she is asleep. She wakes up. They introduce each other her name is Joe and his name is Seligman, a name she calls ""fucking ridiculous"". He tells her its Jewish and it means the happy one. She asks if he's happy. He says he supposes he is, even though hes a person who cuts the nails of the right hand first. He divides humanity into two groups people who cut the nails of the left hand first are more lighthearted and have a tendency to enjoy life more because they go for the easiest task and save the difficulties for later. She says she always cuts the nails on the left hand first and doesn't think there's a choice; go for the pleasure first and then after the left hand is done, the right hand becomes the easiest one left (as compared to something a chore, like he considered it). He says he had never thought of it that way.She notices rugelach (a Jewish cake) on a plate he brought for her and is intrigued by the fact that he is serving it with a cake fork. Joe says pastries shouldn't be eaten with a cake fork since its un-manly and feminine. She explains that she also knew someone who ate rugelach daily with a cake fork and she needs to tell him about Jerôme.CHAPTER TWO: JERÔMEAn older Joe is seen in a montage, having sex with several different men. One by one, she tells each of them that they had given her her first orgasm. She explains in voice-over that B and her had started a club called The Little Flock. A group of girls gather together and recite ""Mea vulva, mea maxima vulva"" while someone else plays an organ. In present day, Seligman tells her the music is almost Satanic, using a triton, the Devils Interval, which was banned from music in the Middle Ages. Joe says the Vacuum Cleaner invented it on the piano, explaining she got the nickname because she had a sort of vacuum cleaner in her cunt that could get an erection from flaccid penises. She says the club was about fucking and the right to be horny but was also rebellious; they weren't allowed to have boyfriends and couldn't have sex with the same guy more than once. They were fixated on combating the love-fixated society.A girl smashes a window with a display of hearts in the window. During a club meeting, B admits to having sex with the same guy three times and is reprimanded by Joe. B tries to justify her relationship but Joe chastises her for using the word relationship. B tells Joe she doesn't know everything about sex and whispers that the secret ingredient to sex is love. Joe is seen storming out.In present day, Joe says ""For me, love was just lust with jealousy added"". She continues, For every 100 crimes committed in the name of love, only one is committed in the name of sex. Joe explains she then desired a serious education. Seligman chuckles he envisions Joe's form of education involving masturbating with a pointing stick at the front of a classroom, wearing pigtails and glasses, using the stick to point out Glasgow on a map and then continue to masturbate with it.Joe tried to study medicine like her father but it was hard for her to concentrate so she dropped out of medical school. She applies for a job as an assistant at a printing house but has not acquired any appropriate skills. The woman interviewing her is unimpressed when Joe admits she didn't think skills would be necessary for secretarial work. The woman says she will discuss the possibility of her being hired with her boss, Jerôme, but doubts she has any chance. When she comes back, she lets her know Jerôme has agreed to hire her.She starts work the next day. Jerôme is revealed to be an adult Shia LeBeouf (who she lost her virginity to). It takes her a second to remember him. He brags about his position in the office (author's note: in a horrible British accent, yikes) and asks if she's thought of him since they were together; she obviously hasn't. He explains that his uncle usually works in the private office they're in but he's been horribly sick so he is taking his place in the meantime. Jerôme takes Joe on a tour, first introducing her officially to the woman who she interviewed with, Liz.They ride in an old elevator lift. When Joe's back is turned, Jerôme stops the elevator. He tries to get promiscuous with her but she pushes him away. She says he's not her type so he finally goes back to the control panel and turns the elevator back on; but it doesn't move. They both have to escape by jumping through a panel near the top.In present day, Seligman asks why she didn't have sex with him and she says she doesn't know. He supposes she got fired but she says no, if he had fired her, he would have lost. Since she didn't have any specific work duties, Joe spends her time at work cleaning up Jerôme's office. When he gets in, he is upset with her. He has her go back outside with the breakfast she has made. She knocks on the door and after a short while, he allows her to come in with the breakfast. He asks her why there is no cake fork for his rugelach; she tells him she had felt it was inappropriate.In present day, Seligman admits this is feminine but argues that a cake fork is a practical tool, somewhere between a knife and a fork so you can hold the cake in one hand and cut it with the other. He says that the Bolsheviks in Russia, to separate the men from the boys, sent a boy inside a house before they burned it down, to make sure it had cake forks and the arson was justifiable. Joe points out this isn't true and Seligman laughs.Joe begins seducing several men in the office; she tells one man he needs to wash his hands (to lead him to the bathroom). Another, she flirts with. Shes then seen leaving the bathroom with a third man.Jerôme considers this a game of war. Sometimes, he takes Joe into town just so she can hold his coat. They argue over a parking spot she sees because he claims there isn't enough space between cars to parallel park. He makes an attempt to prove himself right, stopping midway due to lack of space. She talks him into letting them switch seats; she then parallel parks with ease in her first try.At night, Joe is alone in the office, in Jerôme's space. She then began to feel a change inside her, desiring to be one of Jerôme's things, picked up and put down again and again. She scalds herself for seeing him in this new light. Seligman responds, ""Love is blind"", but she corrects him: ""Love distorts things. Or even worse, love is something you'd never ask for."" The erotic is something she asked for, or even demanded from men, but idiotic love and all the dishonest that follows humiliated her. Erotic is about saying yes; love appeals to the lowest instincts wrapped up in lies. How do you say yes when you mean no, and vice versa. Seligman points out she is defending her personality instead of simply revealing it.In flashback, Joe takes up walking, the same path she used to walk on with her father. She passes the ash tree, a lady with a poodle, an old man on a bench, and ends up on a little bridge overlooking a pond. She cant free herself from her thoughts of Jerôme and during this time, she wont let the other men shes having sex with touch her body with their hands and eventually stops having sex. She finds out where Jerôme lives but never rings the doorbell. She writes a letter expressing her feelings but it takes a month to get the courage to deliver it; on that date, she finds Jerôme's uncle back at his desk. He asks her for the letter and says he will get it to Jerôme; he complains about how Jerôme is traveling, having just married Liz, the woman that hired Joe.In present day, Joe explains she was promptly fired from her job since she had no experience. Even though he'd disappeared, she tries to keep Jerôme in her thoughts when she masturbates on a train. She finds details in other passengers that reminds them of Jerôme the shoes of one, the hair of another, the hands of another. Then she pieces them together (shown as a puzzle piece) but admits that in the long run, she couldn't hold on to the details of them. Seligman points out that memory is ultimately remembering silhouettes and essentials which Joe doesn't consider a bad thing.A 10-year-old Joe is in the woods with her father, this time in winter, where the crookedness of the trees and branches stand out. He explains that the branches are crooked from having to carry all the leaves into the sunlight, one long struggle for survival. He calls the naked trunks the souls of the trees, a poetic thought that is rare for him since he prefers empirical sciences.Now that Jerôme is gone, Joe intensifies her hunt for men. She compares her cunt to a supermarket door that opens/closes on its own with an overtly sensitive sensor. She experiences many different cocks shown in a photo-montage, grouping them accordingly, including big black cocks and circumcised cocks. She tells Seligman that if they combined all the foreskin cut off over time, it would reach to Mars and back again.Joe sees a painting that reads Mrs. H (the other half of her name is concealed in darkness). This leads toCHAPTER THREE: MRS. HNow, in flashback, Joe has reached a sizable number of lovers and has trouble remembering who is who. She listens to her answering machine and takes notes; since it has become impossible to keep track of the individual relationships and how to converse with them, she invents a method to decide randomly. Using the list of callers, she rolls a dice and if it lands on one, she will be overly loving when she calls them back; if it lands on two, not quite as passionate, and so on to five, which is a complete rejection and six, which is to just ignore the call. She then calls everyone on the pad back and leaves messages rejecting them, being loving, etc. She realizes that this makes her completely unpredictable which drives the men wild. To balance this stress, she looks through the herbarium she's created (a book of plant pressings).Because she's dealing with a large amount of men, there are pieces in their personalities which are hard to circumvent. She asks one, she has labeled H, to leave before her next guest (another lover) will arrive. He refuses to leave so she tells him that he has to get out because she knows he will never leave his family for her sake. She adds that its not satisfying to her that she cant have him completely and so they cant see each other any longer. She pushes him out, obviously not attached to him, and then prepares for her next lover to arrive. Midway through her preparations, there is a knock on the door. H is back; he's left his wife and kids (three young boys) and has come back with a suitcase. In the hall, Joe hears H's wife and kids spying on her. The wife (Uma Thurman) apologizes for intruding and says she just wanted to make sure he got there safe now that he's made the big decision. She asks if the children can go inside.Mrs. H and the kids go into Joe's apartment; the woman is complimentary of the place. She tries to give H his car keys but he is adamant he doesn't want to keep the car. She demands it and then says shell take the bus home as will her children, who will get used to public transport. Joe notices one of the boys is holding a pillow; Mrs. H explains that he embroidered it himself and it is a present for his dad. Mrs. H asks if it's okay if they call H ""Daddy"" here or maybe him or the man. She originally didn't want H to see the children anymore but figured its right for her (former) husband to be confronted with the little people whose lives hes destroyed. Mrs. H continues on, passive-aggressively. She asks if the children can see the whoring bed. She takes the kids to see Daddy's favorite place and leads them into the bedroom where they all stare at Joe's bed. She tells the kids they should memorize the bed so they can recall it years later, in therapy. She then says shes being silly and suggests they all have a cup of tea. She tells Joe that the children's father likes two lumps of sugar in his tea.Joe's next lover arrives. Mrs. H takes the flowers he is holding and then introduces all of her kids to the new suitor. Mrs. H admires the ménage à trois (assuming the new lover already knows Mr. H) and admits to failing to be as broad-minded. She tells her kids that they should ask all the questions their hearts desire and hopes that they never find themselves in such a situation again. None of the kids have anything to say. Mrs. H starts instead, asking how many lives Joe is able to destroy in one day five, 50, or several hundreds. Joe explains this is a big misunderstanding; she tells the kids she doesn't love their father. Mrs. H says shes just saying that to make them feel better because if this was a joke, it would be a joke so cruel and nobody can be that cruel to destroy a mesh of feelings woven over 20 years. She then tells the kids they should get away before things get too grotesque. One of her kids runs back to hug his dad and she pulls him away, saying she wouldn't want to give his father a guilty conscience. Mrs. H then begins screaming, goes back and slaps her husband, and then exits the building, screaming as she goes.Seligman asks how this episode affected Joe's life and she says, not at all and you cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. He tells her some people blame the addict and others feel sorry for the addict; she explains that she was an addict out of lust and not out of need. For her, nymphomaniac was callousness. He asks how she felt during all this; she explains that sex was her constant companion yet she still felt alone.Flashback to Joe at age seven, having to have an operation with anesthesia. She is in the hospital hallway while the doctors prepare for the operation, and when she looks into the room, she feels as if she had to pass through an impenetrable gate all by herself. It wasn't because she missed her mom or dad but was as if she was completely alone in the universe; as if her whole body was filled with loneliness and tears.Seligman asks if hes not allowed to feel sorry for her. She responds by saying, Shall we go on? She sees he is reading a book which he explains is from the works of Edgar Allan Poe. He tells her he died in the worst imaginable way, in something called delirium tremors, which occurs when a long term use of alcohol is followed by a sudden abstinence, forcing your body into hypersensitive shock. This leads to horrifying hallucinations of rats and snakes and cockroaches coming out of the floor and worms slithering in the walls. The entire nervous system is on high alert and you have a constant panic and paranoia and then the circulatory system fails; but the panic and horror remains until the moment of death. Joe admits she knows what delirium is.CHAPTER FOUR: DELIRIUMIn flashback, an adult Joe walks alone in the courtyard of a hospital (filmed in black and white). She enters the hospital room of her sleeping father (still played by Christian Slater). He wakes up and she tells him that her mother is not coming; he defends her, saying she fears hospitals. Joe calls her a ""cowardly, stupid bitch"" but her father continues to defend her.Joe asks him if he's afraid but he says no; as a doctor, hes seen many die and does not fear death. He recites a quote about death, When we are, death does not come; when death has come, we are not. He explains we know its going to happen and thus is not afraid.At night, Joe's dad awakes from sleep, screaming out loud. He begins to sob. She tries to comfort him but he is having hallucinations and doesn't respond. A nurse comes in later and tells Joe she will stay with her father if Joe wants to go on a walk. Joe does, walking in the same courtyard at the beginning of the sequence. She looks up at the trees. Joe returns to the room with leaves from the ash tree. She pretends to not remember the story of the ash tree in winter and so he tells her the story again. He then begins having another attack of delirium. The doctors struggle to subside him and force him into a straightjacket while Joe backs away, crying. She is led out of the room by a doctor.A sullen Joe wanders the hospital. She finds an orderly working downstairs. Cut to her having sex with him, desperately trying to fill a void.Later, she is asleep on a chair in her dad's room. She wakes up and sees feces running down the side of his hospital bed. She tells someone outside and two nurses and a janitor begin to clean up. Joe's father has soiled himself while in the straightjacket; as they clean up, they make sure he is still tied down. He stares up at Joe with a wild look in his eyes, as if he is completely gone. She watches the nurse wipe her helpless dad.Cut to Joe having sex with someone else in the hospital. It fails to comfort her and she ends up sobbing afterwards, eventually falling asleep.Joe's father is now deceased, with a rose placed on his chest. Joe says after his death, she had no feelings left and felt shameful. Her mother is in the room, too, but she quickly leaves; Joe is left alone with her father. She goes on to explain that the shame she felt was, in seeing her dead father, she lubricated.Seligman tells Joe that he knows she wants to present herself in a certain way and has a dark bias that shes worse than anyone else but this story doesn't add to the belief. He tells her its extremely common to react sexually in a crisis; it may be shameful to her but in literature, there are many worse examples. She seems appreciative of him saying this but doesn't respond verbally.He cleans her plate and when he returns, she acknowledges his cassette player. She asks him to play what is in the machine. He tells her its Bach from his organ book. He was the master of polyphony, a European phenomenon from the Middle Ages that distinguishes that every voice is its own melody but together, in harmony. (In other words, two or more independent melodies are sung/played simultaneously, as opposed to a monophony, which is just one voice). Bach wrote many words for several choirs at the same time, wallowing in polyphony. This affects the melodic expression and the harmony, also mixed up with some rather incomprehensible mystique regarding numbers, most likely based on the Fibonacci sequence it starts with 0, 1 then adds the two numbers together so its 0+1 = 1, 1+1 = 2, 2+1 = 3, 2+ 3 = 5, etc. It is all about finding out a divine methodology in art and architecture, a bit like the way triton (played on the organ in B and Joe's club) is supposed to be a Satanic interval. The sum of the number values for Bach's name (B=2, A=1, C=3, H=8) equals 14, a number Bach used a lot of in his compositions. All the numbers are also Fibonecci numbers. The piece Seligman played has three voices Bach's voice, played with the pedal on the organ, a second voice played with the left hand, and a third voice played with the right hand a cantus firmus. Together, these three voices create the polyphony.Joe explains that normally nymphomaniacs are seen as people who cant get enough and therefore have sex with many different people; but if shes being honest, she sees it precisely as the sum of different sexual experiences. So in that way, she has only one lover.CHAPTER FIVE: THE LITTLE ORGAN SCHOOLSince the music has three voices, Joe limits herself to talking about three lovers. The bass is easy, a man she codifies as F. He has a used red car. As shes having sex with seven or eight men at this time, scheduling was tricky and they all had to have precise appointments. F always got there an hour early, with flowers, and waited patiently in his car for an hour. If she was having sex against the window and sees him, it always made her smile. Sometimes, she would let him come in and drink coffee while she finished with her previous lover. She appreciated that not only did he know what she wanted during sex, there was kind of a telepathy going on between them without saying anything, he knew what she wanted and where she wanted to be touched. His most sacred goal was her orgasm and she gave him privileges none of the others received; such as allowing him to give her a sponge bath. F was the bass voice monotone, predictable, and ritualistic but also the foundation that is so important, even if on its own, it doesn't mean much.We see 1/3 of the screen (the far left) as a shot of the red car and F's sexual encounters with Joe intercut with Seligman's foot on the organ pedal and the organ pipes, demonstrating that he is the first voice.A knock on the door. We now meet G, the only one of her lovers she had to and wanted to wait for. When he finally shows up, he doesn't immediately enter, the way a cat doesn't when you let it in as if once the door is open, it has all the time in the world. But she considers him more of a jaguar or a leopard, pointing out that he moved the same way as one (we see a naked G walking intercut with a leopard walking). They have sex; he is aggressive and in charge. On 1/3 of the screen (the far right), we see a jaguar devouring its prey, then intercut with a naked G walking, then Seligman's left hand playing the organ. The far left 1/3 of the screen then shows the F montage again; meanwhile, we hear both musical notes simultaneously. There is a black 1/3 between the two, demonstrating that there is a missing third piece of the polyphony.Joe explains that despite her success in managing the complicated logistics of arranging up to ten daily sexual satisfactions while also having a full-time job, Joe was still praying to a certain sadness so she would try to squeeze in walks when she could. We see her go on the same walk wed seen earlier past the ash tree, a woman with a poodle, a man on a bench. This is repeated again and again, at different speeds. She correlates this with the movements of a caged animal, as we see a lion pacing in a small cage; basically, we are all waiting for permission to die.During her latest walk, Joe finds fragments scattered around on the path. She begins to pick them up and discovers they are torn up photographs. When she pieces them together, its revealed to be shots of Jerôme.Suddenly, a hand reaches out to grab hers. On top of the bridge overlooking the pond is Jerôme. In present day, Seligman says there are completely unrealistic coincidences in her story; first that he hires her as a secretary by chance and then she takes a walk in a forest that is littered with photos of him and that hes present and pulls her up to her feet.She explains that Jerôme was there because he'd just had a fight with his wife, who was angry and tore up the photographs from their travels. Joe tells Seligman he'll get more out of the story by believing it than by not believing it; he admits this is true. Cut back to B whispering to Joe that the secret ingredient to sex is love.In present day, Joe admits that this ended up being the third voice of the secret ingredient. Seligman agrees that she has created a cantus firmus.Jerôme and Joe have sex...... graphically, in a several minute long sequence.She tells him (voiced in present day but synched in flashback), ""Fill all my holes.""We now hear the melody again, with all three parts a three-way split screen showing lovers F, Jerôme, and G, along with shots of the musical equivalents on the organ (foot, left hand, right hand). The montage ends with shots of them all having sex with Joe before cutting to Seligman's tape player cutting off and the music stopping.Back to the sex scene with Jerôme and Joe. She zones out and he asks her what's wrong. She explains that she can't feel anything. She repeats: ""I can't feel anything"" over and over, eventually breaking down crying as the film cuts to black.To be continued..........Scenes from upcoming Nymphomaniac: Vol. II are shown during the end credits."

One night, Billy rapes and kills an underage prostitute and is cornered by Thai police. Lieutenant Chang allows the girl's father, Choi Yan Lee, to exact his vengeance on Billy however he sees fit. Choi chooses to beat Billy to death in the same room Billy killed the girl, but Chang later cuts off Choi's forearm for allowing his daughter to be a prostitute in the first place.

She offers to cut him into her drug dealing operation if he will put out a hit on Chang.The police arrive at Julian's club investigating Choi's murder, but Chang concludes that Julian is not the killer.

Dom Hemingway,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402105/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After spending 12 years in prison for keeping his mouth shut, notorious safe-cracker Dom Hemingway is back on the streets of London looking to collect what he's owed. Vulgar, brash and loud, Dom Hemingway has just been released from prison after serving twelve years for his crime as a safe-cracker working for Ivan Fontaine, who Dom's best friend and associate Dickie Black calls one of the most dangerous men in Europe. Dom left the employ of Lestor McGreevy, a man he generally disliked, to work for Fontaine. Dom could have easily plea bargained with the authorities to give up information on Fontaine for a reduced sentence, he not doing so which resulted in he never again seeing his wife Katherine who died of cancer while he was in prison, and now being estranged from his young adult daughter Evie who sees his choice as his priority of Fontaine over her and her mother. For his silence and giving up twelve years of his life, Dom believes Fontaine owes him and owes him big, and with Dickie by his side, tries to track down Fontaine for that payment. Despite his encounter with a young new ageist woman named Melody, his actions which she vows will lead to luck shining down on him, Dom impatiently waits for good luck to come his way as one thing after another seems to go wrong, whether it be in dealing with Fontaine and by association his trophy Romanian girlfriend Paolina, in his attempt to reconcile with Evie, and/or in his attempt to find work specifically with McGreevy's son, Lestor Jr. who, as an apple, doesn't fall far from the tree.—Huggo The first thing we hear is Dom Hemingway (Jude Law) asking, ""Is my cock not exquisite?"" He continues to praise his cock, saying outlandish things like it ought to win the first ever Nobel Peace Prize to be given to a cock, and that it could save starving children in third world countries. He then orgasms and tells the person giving him oral sex, sorry for not giving him a warning.Chapter 1: 12 YEARS IS A LONG TIMEDom is eating pudding in the prison cafeteria when a guard comes over to talk to him. He tells Dom to put his fork down but Dom insists on finishing his pudding. He relents and speaks to the guard. He tells Dom that the call he's been waiting for has arrived. Dom smiles. He is released from prison, with the other inmates chanting his name and throwing toilet paper out the windows.Dom spots two men standing outside a pub. He asks both of them where to find Sandy Butterfield (Nick Raggett). After he shoves one man's drink out of his hand, the other man tells Dom that Sandy is still working at a garage. Dom goes to this garage and beats Sandy's face in because he got with Dom's wife while he was in prison. Sandy defends his actions because they had been divorced, but Dom continues to pound the guy's face. When he's done, he turns to two other guys and makes friendly talk with them.Dom reunites with his former partner, Dickie Black (Richard E. Grant), in a pub. Dom pulls out a cigarette to smoke, but he's told by the bartender and Dickie that smoking's been banned. Regardless, he lights it up and gives Dickie one to smoke as well. Dickie tells Dom that their former employer, Mr. Ivan Anatoly Fontaine (Demian Bichir) has not forgotten that he owes Dom. Dom had worked for Fontaine as a safe-cracker and served 12 years for not testifying against him. Dom knows he's missed a lot over the years, including a relationship with his daughter Evelyn (Emilia Clarke). In the corner of the pub are two girls, said by Dickie to be sent as gifts to Dom from Fontaine. An eager Dom scoops one of the ladies up and kisses the other. He announces to the pub, ""No one call me for three days!""The next day, a hungover Dom ventures with Dickie on a train to head to the south of France to meet with Fontaine. At the station, a heavyset man meets the two and says he was sent by Fontaine. He tells the two to follow him, and Dom makes him carry his luggage.Chapter 2: A WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY AMONGST THIEVESThe thieves arrive at Fontaine's villa. Dom's eye is caught by Fontaine's beautiful girlfriend Paolina (Madalina Ghenea). Dickie tells him to not look at her. They find Fontaine out hunting with his rifle. He asks Dom if he ever uses a gun for hunting. Dom says no, but only to hold up a place or threaten someone...or rob them...or pistol-whip them...or scare them, but never for hunting. Fontaine invites the two inside for a drink. He makes a comment about ""Leftie"" being right about Dom maintaining his vanity and wit, yet Dom has no idea who he's talking about. Fontaine means Dickie, making Dom aware of Dickie's left hand sporting a glove. It was shot off a while ago, but Dom just thought the glove was a fashion statement. Dom then starts to mock Fontaine, calling him ""Ivana Anal-tolly"", still enraged at being locked up for 12 years because of him. Fontaine never gets angry, but he warns Dom to not make him get rough. Dom calms down and leaves.Dickie finds Dom storming off outside completely nude. He runs out to get him back, reprimanding him for speaking rudely to Fontaine, saying he's lucky that Fontaine didn't kill him right there. Dom feels like he shouldn't be there, but Dickie convinces him to stay. Dickie adds that he's not burying Dom out there because he's ""too fucking old and he didn't bring the right shoes.""Dom apologises to Fontaine and he and Dickie have dinner with Fontaine and Paolina. Fontaine treats the two to a musical performance by Paolina. As she sings, Fontaine tells Dom a story about how he viciously beat his best friend's jaw, nearly completely destroying it, after the man accidentally drove a bicycle into a woman that Fontaine had interest in. He didn't kill Dom for his behavior because he knew that he still owed him.Chapter 3: GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAITFontaine presents Dom with a quarter of a million pounds, plus another half a million. Dom becomes excited and hugs the money.Fontaine invites two women over to party and do coke with his guests, and everybody gets in the pool. One of the women, Melody (Kerry Condon), swims over to Dom. She compliments his chin, and he, in turn, compliments her breasts. Later, the whole party drives down the road. Dom stands up and shouts boastfully, right before the car collides with another car, throwing everybody out. Dom is unconscious, but he hears Paolina's voice calling his name and saying ""I want the money"". He briefly has a fantasy of her in a sexy swimsuit emerging from the pool before he's awoken by a thunderclap. Dom walks through the rain. He calls out for anybody. Fontaine walks by him, impaled by a piece of the car. He falls against the car, dead. Dom then finds Melody lying face down near a lake. He tries to resuscitate her and is able to revive her. She thanks Dom for saving her life and tells him good luck will come to him for this deed when he least expects it and most needs it. Dickie comes in and finds them. He says he saw Paolina heading down the road.Dom and Dickie return to Fontaine's home for Dom's money. All Dom finds is a few fifty pound notes put together in the shape of a heart. Dom then sees Paolina driving down the road, far away with the money. He runs through the woods to catch up to her, falling right in the middle of the road, inches from where she pulls up. Paolina rolls down the window, and Dom sees his money sitting in the passenger seat next to her. He asks her ""Why?"" She asks him, ""Do I strike you as the type of woman that wants to be poor?"" She rolls the window back up and drives away, leaving Dom sitting in the road as the rain pours.Dom shows up at Evelyn's apartment, drinking from a bottle of whiskey and with his face messed up. All she can say is, ""You've gotta be fucking kidding me,"" and Dom drops to the floor like a ton of bricks.Chapter 4: FATHER OF THE YEARDom wakes up to see Evelyn's boyfriend Hugh (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), along with his father, brother, and son. Later, Hugh introduces Dom to his and Evelyn's son, Jawara (Jordan Nash). Dom questions the name choice, which Hugh defends as it means ""peace-loving"". Dom jokes that his own name means ""unlucky son of a bitch."" Hugh tells Dom that Evelyn is mad at him and that she's hurt by his absence. He adds that she will play music with him that evening at a club called Cargo so Dom can check them out. Dom does go see the performance, with Evelyn singing ""Fisherman's Blues"". Dom is mesmerized by hearing his daughter singing.Dom goes to Dickie's home, lamenting that Evelyn wants nothing to do with him. He decides that he needs to seek employment from Lestor, Jr. (Jumayn Hunter), the son of Dom's old nemesis. Dickie warns Dom that Lestor is worse than his father.Dom finds Lestor jogging with his two goons. Lestor recognizes him and then punches him in the stomach. He hates Dom for killing his cat Bernard when Lestor was a boy. Even though they hate each other, Dom proposes that they do business. Although he doesn't like the idea, Lestor gives him a challenge - Dom is to open a new electronic safe at Lestor's club in under ten minutes, and if he is successful, Dom is to work for him. If Dom fails, Lestor will cut off Dom's cock and use it as a doorstop. Dom agrees, and then gets punched in the gut again as payback for the cat.Chapter 5: AND JUST LIKE THAT, OPPORTUNITY KNOCKSDickie joins Dom as they go to Lestor's club to crack the safe inside a wall. Dom takes a sledgehammer and smashes the wall up until he can see the wires around the safe, which he cuts off with a power saw. He grabs the safe and starts thrusting against it sexually, so that the 'pins are out of alignment' then throws it on the floor, where it finally opens. Dom feels triumphant, until Lestor tells him he only has 52 seconds left. He takes out a smaller safe from a box, revealing that to be the safe he wanted him to open. He forces Dom to drop his trousers so he can cut off his cock. At the last second, two safe security guards run into the room. Dickie smashes a small statue over Lestor's head, and Dom hits his goons with the sledgehammer. They run like hell out of the club, and then split up.Dom waits outside Cargo to find Evelyn after her band's performance. She is still angry with him, stating that he could have served only two or three years if he struck a deal and testified against Fontaine, but he ended up missing his wife dying and most of Evelyn's life. Dom tells her he is going to visit her mother's grave the next day and that she should bring her son with her so they can go together. Evelyn tells him that she only ever wanted a real father, but instead got him. She turns her back and leaves.Chapter 6: A MAN WITH NO OPTIONS SUDDENLY HAS ALL THE OPTIONS IN THE WORLDThe next morning, Dom is out on the streets when he spots Melody riding her motor scooter. He stops her and tells her that he hasn't had any good luck since saving her. Melody asks him what it is that he really wants. Dom firmly states he wants his money back, then he realizes that he just wants Evelyn to talk to him. Melody tells him that by admitting this, the ""pendulum of luck"" will swing his way because love is what he makes of it.Dom visits his wife's grave, tearfully apologizing and feeling regretful for all the years he's missed and for abandoning her and Evelyn. He looks up and sees Jawara next to him. He tells the boy this is his grandmother's grave. Apparently, she wasn't fond of colored people, but Dom thinks she would have loved him. He walks Jawara out of the cemetery to meet back up with Evelyn. Dom asks her if he can walk around with her and Jawara without having to say anything. She says not today, but he is welcome to take Jawara to school on Monday if he's not too drunk the night before. They walk away, and Jawara waves to Dom. He waves back.Dom walks away, still feeling a lack of closure, until he sees someone and a smile forms on his face. It's Paolina walking into a restaurant with an older man. Dom follows them in and approaches their table. He greets Paolina, who claims to not know who he is. He leans in to place his hand on hers and whisper in her ear menacingly that he is the fucker who will gut her with a butter knife and dump her body in the river without anybody knowing. Paolina trembles in fear. He warns her not to say a word when he removes his hand or else he'll do all of that right now. After all the heartbreaks and sadness, he feels that the pendulum of luck has finally swung back his way. He stands up, drinks her date's wine, and then kisses her. He exits the restaurant and we see him holding something - Paolina's diamond ring. Dom flicks it up and walks away with it, wearing a big victorious grin on his face."

The next day she is told she has to take a longer route than she anticipated as her planned route takes her through sacred land and none of the elders will accompany her once they uncovered Rick's transgression.After trekking through particularly inhospitable land and having to shoot feral camel bulls in heat, Robyn is relieved to find a watering hole. A group of elders arrive at Robyn's campsite. When she says she can't take the short route as it will pass through sacred land, an elder offers to accompany her across that area to the campsite of a man called Glendle.Eddy and Robyn arrive at Glendle's camp site.

Babli realizes that there is no right way of doing the wrong thing. Babli sets out to fix all the wrongs in his life and he continues to be shameless about it.—Reliance Entertainment Bhim Singh Chandel (Jaaved Jaafrey) is a notorious don, who specializes in Hawala transactions.

Phantom,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1922685/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The haunted Captain of a Soviet submarine holds the fate of the world in his hands. Forced to leave his family behind, he is charged with leading a covert mission cloaked in mystery. The Cold War has cast an ominous chill over the entire globe, and when a Soviet submarine targets the U.S. Navy's Pacific fleet for nuclear attack, it appears that the final battle has begun. But Captain Dmitri Zubov has a choice - one that could pull the world back from the brink of annihilation. Meanwhile, it begins to seem as if other forces are at work on Captain Zubov's submarine. Now, in the depths of the South Pacific, Captain Zubov will fight to reconcile his past in order to ensure that there will be a future. Not just for him, but for every man, woman, and child on the planet.. Ed Harrisplays the captain of a Cold War Soviet missile submarine who has secretly been suffering from seizures that alter his perception of reality. Forced to leave his wife and daughter, he is rushed into a classified mission, where he is haunted by his past and challenged by a rogue KGB group (led byDavid Duchovny) bent on seizing control of the ship's nuclear missile. With the fate of humanity in his hands, Harris discovers he's been chosen for this mission in the belief he would fail. 'Phantom' is a suspense submarine thriller about extraordinary men facing impossible choices.—RCR Media Group At Rybachiy Naval Base, Submarine Squadron Commander Vladimir Markov (Lance Henriksen) meets with Dmitri Demi Zubov (Ed Harris) and tells him that he has been ordered to take command of submarine V67 (the first submarine that Zubov commanded early in his career), for one last cruise before both the submarine and Zubov retire from the fleet. The V67 is to be stripped and refitted for sale to the Chinese navy. Zubov is appalled that the Russians would allow their submarines to be possessed by an enemy. Markov explains that it's expensive to run a modern nuclear navy, and it also isn't all bad to let their enemies have access to their old and outdated equipment.Zubov complains that he and his men have only been back for three weeks from their most recent cruise of 76 days and that there are numerous other well rested boats and crews available. Markov tells Zubov that the mission is to accommodate a request by a special projects group with the KGB, who say they need the most experienced commander and boat in the Russian navy to carry out their objective. It may also not be coincidental that the Americans are currently increasing their naval assets in the Pacific Ocean. Markov tells Zubov that they were unsuccessful at rounding up all of Zubov's crew from their vacations, so some replacements will necessarily be used.Markov also tells Zubov that the command wanted to honor him by allowing him to take the V67 on it's last official cruise. Zubov seems very skeptical about that. While his father, Nicolai Zubov, was very well respected in the Russian submarine service, and a new academy is to be named for him, Zubov had a less distinguished career. He had some of the lowest grades ever for an officer at the academy and he was struggling with alcohol and drug use to deal with both physical and emotional difficulties resulting from an incident where he rammed the V67 into the back of another Russian submarine that killed 6 of his crew and induced epilepsy in him caused by a head injury.Zubov asks Markov if he thinks they can ever be redeemed for the things they've done. Markov says, ""In our dreams, maybe.""Zubov goes to a bachelor party being attended by his officers. One of them, Sasha (Jason Gray-Stanford), is due to be married. There are several big-breasted women and plenty of alcohol involved with the celebration. Zubov hands his executive officer, Alex Kozlov (William Fichtner), their orders. After reading them, Kozlov announces to the others that they will be shipping out at 1400 the next day.That night, Zubov attends the wedding of Shasha and his fiance. The priest had agreed to get up in the middle of the night and do the ceremony. There were five people total in the church. Zubov tells Sasha he has two hours to consummate the marriage before he must report for duty and then tosses him some keys to a room.Zubov goes home and kisses his daughter (Tessa Robinson) as she sleeps and apologizes to his wife Sophie for having to go back to sea. Sophie just remains silent, obviously disappointed.
At the dock where the V67 is located, Kozlov complains to Zubov about the age and poor condition of the boat, but nevertheless he goes about working to get everything ready.Pavlov (Johnathon Schaech), the Russian political officer on board for the trip, introduces Zubov to Bruni (David Duchovny), a ""technician"" with the KGB, who will be going along, in addition to several other KGB men who will be helping him. They have a new piece of highly classified equipment that has been attached to the submarine and they need to test it. Bruni seems to recognize Zubov and says, ""Nice to see you again, Captain."" Zubov looks at him and acknowledges his comment, but obviously doesn't recognize Bruni.The V67 was built to accommodate 86 people, so with the added KGB staff, it was very close quarters.The payload includes a nuclear missile and a small yellow canary (used to monitor air quality for potentially lethal gases).Pavlov gives Zubov two envelopes containing their respective orders. The envelopes are to be opened once they are at sea. Zubov puts them in a small wall safe in his stateroom. Pavlov also hands keys on neck chains to both Zubov and Kozlov. He also has one. They are the launch control keys for the nuclear missile.As the V67 sails from its pier and past the office of Admiral Markov, Markov is watching out the window, outfitted in his dress uniform, and standing at attention. He brings a pistol up and points it at his temple, as though saluting, then pulls the trigger and kills himself.As the sub continues towards the sea wall and on out to sea, Kozlov asks Zubov what the strange looking device attached to the outer hull is. Zubov tells Kozlov that device represents the shortest distance between Kozlov and his own command, that if he doesn't screw up this mission, he'll soon be in charge of a nuclear submarine. Markov told him as much.Right after Zubov orders the boat to dive, he hears a loud clanging noise and aborts the dive. The sub resurfaces and the crew inspects the topside deck. Zubov thought someone might have been left out there and had made the noise. There was no one there, so they dive again.Bavenod (Julian Adams), is the navigator on the boat. He's one of the replacement crew, telling Zubov that he came from the November, a nuclear sub and that he requested the transfer because he heard that crews on diesel boats were the best.As Zubov heads for his stateroom, he passes the room where the KGB have their monitoring and control equipment. He jumps as a Rottweiller sticks it's head out of the door and growls and barks viciously. The dog is not real but is something imagined by Zubov.Kozlov comes to see Zubov in his quarters and informs the captain that the replacement crew members all have no personnel records, just name, and rank. He notes that Bavenod is actually listed among the dead from an accident on another submarine. Kozlov thinks the technicians are KGB radical commandos and trained assassins. Zubov tells Kozlov that once they are deep in the water, they will do some drills, to make sure the replacements know what to do in case of an emergency.The Sonar Operator (Jordan Bridges) detects another submarine, likely an American fast-attack, and Zubov orders evasive measures, including entering the thermocline and ejecting noise countermeasures.Zubov finally opens the envelope containing his orders and has Kozlov read them to the crew over the intercom. The orders direct them to proceed to near where the American fleet is located and once there to test the new equipment.The emergency drills begin and include a simulated hydrogen leak in battery cell #1; and flooding within a compartment. In real life, if salt water encounters the electrolytes in the batteries, it creates deadly chlorine gas. The drill doesn't go well, as Zubov calculates they would all have been killed.Sonar detects a large surface contact and Bruni orders Zubov to put the boat directly underneath that ship. Kozlov is against that, not knowing what sort of ship that might be. Zubov orders the boat to approach from the rear, at periscope depth, so they can see what it is. It turns out to be a large Panamanian tanker. Bruni wants Zubov to put the sub under the tanker. Complicating matters is the fact that the boat's batteries have only 30-35 minutes time left before they need to be recharged on the surface. Zubov orders the sub to get behind and then under the tanker.One of the KGB techs in the control room keeps asking for the sub to be moved closer and closer to the tanker, until it's only about 15 feet from it's keel, at risk of getting hit by the huge propellers. Finally, with battery power gone, they are forced to drop down and fall back, getting tossed around harshly by the propeller wash of the large ship.Pavlov questions why Zubov drinks rum rather than vodka, which would be more patriotic. Zubov tells him that he drinks what he likes, not what is politically correct.In response to why he and Zubov find themselves on the V67 at that particular time, when they are older than most of the men on board, Zubov jokingly explains that it's Admiral Markov's reprisal for him marrying Sophie. As they continue their discussion, Zubov experiences mental images of bad things happening and he suffers and epileptic seizure. When he regains his senses, Dr. Semak (Jason Beghe) is there, holding him and calming him. The doctor explains to Pavlov that the seizures happen only once or twice per year and the shitty government medication he takes doesn't help any.When they are alone, Zubov tells Dr. Semak that he has dreams so clear he can't tell them from reality and at times he feels he's losing his mind. Pavlov confronts Kozlov about the captain's condition, as he's worried about potential consequences should the communist party find out. Kozlov simply responds that he's not going to tell them.Sonar detects an American skipjack submarine in the area. Kozlov orders evasive maneuvers, which gets the attention of Bruni, who wants the sub to surface and the diesel engines started, which of course would advertise their existence and position to the skipjack. Captain Zubov is back on the bridge and Bruni tells him to surface and start the engines, but he won't tell him why. He just tells Zubov to have some faith. Not wanting trouble with the KGB, Zubov issues the orders.After the diesel engines are started, Bruni orders his men to engage the Phantom. The noise level around the boat increases dramatically, as though the sub suddenly grew giant propellers that were churning in the water.The American skipjack turns and falls in behind the V67. Zubov calls the crew to battle stations, loads a torpedo and opens the outer door, ready to fire. After maybe half a minute, Sonar announces that the skipjack returned to it's original course. Zubov looks at Bruni and asks him if the Phantom was some sort of cloaking device. They adjourn to the wardroom where Bruni explains that the Phantom is a system capable of recording the screw noises from any ship at sea and then re-broadcasting it so that any sub or ship monitoring them will think they are the type of ship whose sounds are being broadcast. Thus, the skipjack thought it was following a Panamanian tanker.Captain Zubov plans to report on the success of the equipment test once they reach a pre-established reporting point. No one disagrees, however when it's just him, Kozlov, Dr. Semak and Pavlov remaining in the wardroom, a discussion ensues about what the KGB's options may be with regard to the boat and the Phantom. The potential exists for the KGB to take control of the boat and initiate an attack on the Americans, given that the Phantom would make it possible for them to become undetectable by either the Americans or their own Russian navy. Zubov thinks it would be good to have some sort of confirmation from squadron command that things are going as they planned.Pavlov warns Zubov and the other two officers that they should be very careful about making accusations like that. Zubov tells Pavlov that sometimes in life you have to take sides, not necessarily knowing if you're on the right side or not.As they reach the reporting point, Zubov orders the boat towards the surface so they can broadcast their position and confirm their orders. Bruni and one of his men don't want Zubov to do that, saying it would compromise their mission, which is to remain undetected. Pavlov supports their position. When Zubov threatens to arrest Bruni and Pavlov, one of Bruni's men draws a pistol and holds it to the captain's chest. He says if the order to dive the boat isn't given, he'll shoot Zubov. Kozlov orders the boat to dive.Bruni then proclaims out loud that Captain Zubov abuses alcohol and medication and suffers from seizures due to a brain injury, the result of colliding with Vladimir Markov's boat in a training exercise, killing six sailors. He observes that Zubov also posted one of the lowest scores ever at the Officer's Training School and he kept himself from being expelled from the navy only through bribery and his father's reputation. Finally, he tells everyone that Zubov even tried killing himself, but failed at that too.Bruni then gives the crew the choice of standing their posts in service to their country, or joining their captain in a court martial. Bruni gives Zubov one last chance to do as he's ordered. Zubov tells Bruni to go fuck himself and Bruni hits him. Bruni then separates the captain and those loyal to him and puts them in the forward part of the boat, but he puts Kozlov and some other men in the aft part of the boat.In the forward area where Zubov and others are taken, the captain decides he needs to explain what happened to him earlier in his career. He tells his men that in order to defeat an adversary, you must drive the fight and be willing to do the unexpected. In a hunter-killer exercise, with him in command of the V67 and Markov in command of another sub, Zubov placed his sub in the wake of Markov's, knowing that Markov would never expect Zubov to fight in the blind. However, Zubov didn't expect that Markov would reverse his engines. The result was that the subs collided. Zubov's head hit the gyro and knocked him out. When he came to, there was a fire in the forward torpedo room. The men fighting the fire wouldn't come out and after Zubov was forced to seal them inside to save the ship, the men opened the outer hatches and let the sea rush in to extinguish the fire.Because of who his father was, squadron command wouldn't allow Zubov's career to end as a result of the accident. They just sort of exiled him and Markov within the service to keep them from causing any further embarrassments.Zubov tells his men that squadron command would never entrust the Phantom device with someone like him. He says there are only two reasons why a boat would go rogue. One was to defect and the other to start a war. He doubts that the KGB planned to defect.Zubov gets on the boat's secure phone system and calls Kozlov and tells him he's sure the KGB has the launch codes and they need to find a way to disable the nuclear weapon. He asks Kozlov if Tyrtov (Sean Patrick Flanery) is with him, that Tyrtov knows the warhead better than anybody. Tyrtov is with Kozlov. If they can get him to the missile silo, then he could get to the warhead and rearrange the firing triggers. The missile would still launch, but would not result a nuclear explosion.Kozlov also wants to get to the boat's weapons locker, so they arm themselves and re-take control of the boat.Kozlov orders Tyrtov and Bavenod to into the crawl space below the deck. They crawl through narrow spaces until they meet up with Sasha (Jason Gray-Stanford) and another man. Kozlov orders Sasha to go with Tyrtov to get to the missile to reprogram the firing mechanism. Meanwhile, Kozlov and some other men head off to get to the weapons locker.Bruni sets the sub on a course that Pavlov observes would put them extremely close to the American fleet in the vicinity of Midway Atoll. In response to the doctor's question about why Bruni is doing this, Zubov explains that the KGB is likely planning to use the Phantom to broadcast a recording of one of the Russian subs that had already been sold to the Chinese. The Americans will think that the missile was launched by the Chinese and retaliate against them.One of the men with Zubov is a communications expert and he rigs up a device that can be ejected from the sub and once it surfaces, it would broadcast where they are and what they are doing. They do all they can to mask the noise of the ejection, but the capsule doesn't shoot out far enough from the sub and it smacks against the hull as it travels down the length of the boat. Bruni hears the noise and rushes forward to see what's going on. He learns nothing from Zubov or his men, but his interrogation is interrupted by word that a Russian sub is bearing down on them quickly. The transmitting device had worked well, and quickly.The sub coming their way is the November, commanded by the most decorated hunter-killer in the fleet. The November is lining up to shoot at V76. Bruni has no choice but to temporarily return control of the boat to Zubov, because he doesn't have the ability to evade or fight the November.Zubov orders all countermeasures released from the V76 and a decoy torpedo fired. The boat then executes an emergency dive and turn. One of the November's torpedos takes out the decoy, the other continues on and barely misses the conning tower of the V76. Zubov takes the boat deeper and they sit and wait, with the November directly above them. They are at crushing depth and some leaks start to show up.When Zubov observes that the Russian government apparently doesn't approve of the KGB's plan, Bruni explains that what the politicians don't understand is that the Americans have first strike nuclear capability and if they behave like the Russians, they won't hesitate to use it. Zubov argues that the Americans may very well exhibit self-control and not execute a first strike.Bruni explains to Zubov that the Americans have a program called Dark Star. It's an electro-magnetic pulse weapon that can disable any nuclear weapon, land, air or water-based, that the Russians may fire. With that capability, Bruni believes that the Americans could attack Russia at will and the Russians would have no counter-attack ability.Zubov argues that the Americans would have cause not to attack Russia, being an empathic and humane society. Bruni isn't convinced.Sasha and Trytov arrive at the missile silo and Trytov has a panic attack. Seems he's a claustrophobic submariner. Sasha decides he'll have to try and reprogram the firing mechanism, so he has Trytov coach him about what to do once he gets up to the warhead.Koslov, Bavenod and another man disable one of Bruni's men and proceed to the weapons locker.The November fires two torpedoes at V76. Zubov decides to execute the same technique that he did against Markov in their disastrous exercise and brings V76 into the wake of the November. He orders two torpedos rigged to be manually exploded, planning to disable the November rather than kill her. Zubov orders both torpedoes fired, followed by release of more countermeasures and an emergency ascent. The November also releases countermeasures and fires two more torpedoes. Zubov orders his first torpedo detonated. That knocks the two November ""fish"" off course. He then orders the second torpedo detonated within about 100 meters of the November, which causes her some damage and she is forced to surface.Zubov demands to know the target Bruni has in mind. He says it's the Pacific Fleet at Midway. He believes that once the Chinese and Americans destroy each other, Russia will emerge on the right side of history.Koslov and Bavenod arrive at the bridge with their weapons and order Bruni and his men to drop their weapons and stand down. Bruni then says, ""Mr. Bavenod,"" prompting Bavenod to redirect his pistol at the neck of Koslov and the KGB retakes control of the boat.Sasha has accessed the nuclear warhead and is working furiously to re-program the firing mechanism. One of Bruni's men sees the red warning light flashing on the control panel on the bridge, indicating someone's trying to get to the missile. Bruni and his right hand man rush to the silo and find Trytov by the door. Bruni grabs him and slits his throat with a knife, dropping him to the floor and leaving him to bleed out. Bruni then enters the access porthole to the missile and shines his flashlight around. Sasha is on the other side of the missile, out of sight, so Bruni doesn't see him and he backs out and locks the door.Bruni returns to the bridge and collects the firing keys from Pavlov, Koslov, and Zubov. He then orders the missile fueled, firing coordinates entered, warhead activated, firing sequence started, and launch code entered. The launch code doesn't work, as Zubov had managed to compromise it earlier, using his key when he was alone at the control panel.Bruni orders everyone around him to go the captain's cabin where he orders Zubov to open the safe and extract the ship's orders. The orders contain an encrypted message with an alternate launch code. Pavlov tells Zubov not to open the safe. Bruni shoots Pavlov in the stomach. As he's dying, Pavlov says, ""sometimes you have to pick a side."" Dr. Semak then tells Zubov not to open the safe and Bruni shoots him three times in the back.Right then, Sonar advises that the November is firing more torpedoes at them. Koslov is next in line to be shot by Bruni, so to avoid that Zubov gets the orders from the safe and hands them to Bruni. Bruni orders the Phantom to be engaged. Back on the bridge, Bavenod reads the new launch code and Bruni enters it. He then orders the missile tube opened. As he's about to press the launch button, Zubov lunges and tries to stop him, but he's too late.In the missile tube, Sasha sees the missile tube door open above and says, ""oh, shit!"" He then hurriedly completes the separation of two components of the firing mechanism, the last step to ensuring that a nuclear explosion won't occur. The missile launches, likely burning Sasha to death as it exits the boat.As Bruni hurries over to the periscope to have a look around outside, Captain Zubov comes up behind him, taking hold of Bruni's head and smashing it hard against the periscope, then grabbing and holding Bruni's body in front of him as he uses a hand gun given to him by Koslov and shoots Bavenod dead. Other men throughout the boat take down the several other KGB agents on board.Zubov orders the last remaining decoy torpedo fired and an emergency dive. It's too little, too late, as the November's torpedo explodes and seriously damages the V76, sending her to the bottom. As they sit there, Bruni decides to remind Captain Zubov about who he is. He was the boatwains mate on the V76 when they had the encounter with Markov. Zubov had ordered Bruni to seal the hatch to the forward battery, trapping the six men who later died. He said he didn't have the benefit of a father's reputation to save his career, but he claims that Zubov's being selected for this mission wasn't personal, that he was just a target of opportunity.The yellow canary dies and the men are showing signs of breathing toxic fumes. They have some small filter masks they use to try and reduce the effects. Koslov advises Zubov that salt water is in the battery deck, so chlorine gas is being produced. Zubov orders Koslov to get in the egress suit and swim to the surface. It's their only chance for possible rescue and for someone to explain how all that happened was caused by mad men, and not the good men of his crew.None of them have any idea if the missile hit it's target or if the warhead detonated.The movie ends with Koslov escorting Zubov's wife and daughter to the dock, where some sailors are carrying orange body bags across the top of a submarine. Standing shoulder to shoulder on the deck of the sub are the men who were on board the V76. They are now ghosts. Zubov's daughter tells her mother how she wished her father would know how proud she is and the mother responds that he does.The ghosts are apparently aware that either the Americans showed restraint or the missile and warhead didn't explode. Zubov looks upon his wife, daughter and Koslov with fondness and pride as they turn and walk away."

In the picturesque town of Manikpur, West Bengal in 1953, a landlord goes to watch a Chhau dance with his daughter, Pakhi Roy Chaudhary (Sonakshi Sinha), an aspiring writer. After Pakhi has an asthma attack from the ensuing excitement, she is rushed home and given medication. As she recuperates, her father comforts her and narrates the story of the invincible king of the Bhil tribe whose soul resided inside a parrot, telling her that she is the parrot within whom his life resides.One day, after threatening the family driver into letting her drive the family car, Pakhi accidentally bumps into a motorcycle on the road, mildly injuring the handsome young man on the motorcycle. A few days later, the same man shows up at the door, introducing himself to the landlord as Varun Shrivastav (Ranveer Singh), an archaeologist who wants to study the land surrounding the temple that the landlord owns. Over the next few weeks, Varun charms the landlord and his daughter with his knowledge and persona, and is invited, along with his assistant, to live at their expansive mansion.Soon, love brews between Varun and Pakhi as they bond over art and literature, and their love culminates into a passionate affair. Meanwhile, an act passed by the Indian government debars the power of landlords, causing tension in the Chaudhary household. The ancient artifacts the family owns must be sold, and Varun helps arrange the purchases.As Varun's stay comes to an end, he asks Pakhi's father for her hand in marriage, and preparations of their wedding begin. Before the wedding, Varun's uncle, who has raised him, arrives and discourages Varun from marriage, stating that Varun will only give Pakhi grief because of the danger of what he does for a living-people like them are not meant to fall in love and have normal lives. Varun is conflicted but agrees and makes his choice: he and his assistant flee that very night, along with all the valuables they stole from the landlord. On the wedding day, Varun is nowhere to be found, and it is discovered that the idols from the temple have been stolen and the currency notes from the purchase that Varun arranged of the family's artifacts are all counterfeit.A year later, a sick Pakhi is living all alone in Dalhousie.Except for her maid, she has no company. Her father has died and she has still not recovered from her heartbreak . When a police inspector asks her in helping him nab Varun, she refuses to do so, wanting only to forget him. Soon after, Varun and his friend turn up at Dalhousie for their next heist and stay at a lodge on Pakhi's property. Things turn ugly when the police gets wind of their whereabouts and a chase ensues. Varun accidentally kills his friend and a constable, and is injured in the encounter. He removes the bullet and then goes to seek refuge in Pakhi's house.Pakhi and her maid try to turn him over to the police, but he threatens them. Pakhi gives in, but she is nevertheless enraged and repel Varun's comforting advances and explanation. In a letter, she explains to him that she is dying of tuberculosis and will die the day the last leaf falls from the wilting tree outside the window. Her maid leaves the house promising Varun that he wouldn't be reported to the police.Varun plans his escape but when his accomplice comes, he refuses to go, and instead stays behind to take care of the ailing Pakhi. He confesses that he has regretted letting her go since the day he fled. Soon, Pakhi warms up to him and her faith remains intact when each day she finds one last leaf remaining on the tree.In the end, seeing Pakhi's condition improving, Varun decides its time for him to leave, and he takes off, only to come face to face with a police blockade on the road, who proceed to shoot him to death. Pakhi wakes up to find Varun gone, but the tree still has a leaf on it. She becomes suspicious and discovers that the leaf has been affixed to the tree by Varun. Every night, he would tie it on a branch of the tree so that she wouldn't give up hope. It was his masterpiece. Pakhi realizes the truth after she looks at the leaf closely, it's been painted upon, and smiles with tears in her eyes."

Lovelace,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1426329/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story ofLinda Lovelace, who is used and abused by the porn industry at the behest of her coercive husband before taking control of her life. Deep Throat, the first pornographic feature film to be a mainstream success, was an international sensation in 1972 and made its star, Linda Lovelace (Seyfried), a media darling. Years later, the 'poster girl for the sexual revolution' revealed a darker side to her story. The film's plot is non-linear. This summary is presented in chronological order.In 1970 in Davie, Florida, Linda Boreman and her best friend Patsy go roller skating when they volunteer to dance on stage to the local band at the roller rink.

However, after Linda breaks a curfew one too many times, she moves out of her fiercely religious parents' house and marries Traynor. During a party, Linda watches one of Traynor's homemade porno films for the first time.Six months later, Linda bails Traynor out of jail after he is arrested for soliciting prostitution. Desperate for money, Traynor forces Linda into prostitution at gunpoint. Shortly afterwards, he has her audition at B&A Films in New York City, where she lands a career after Traynor shows producers Nat Laurendi and Anthony Romano an 8mm film of her doing fellatio.Linda travels back to Florida and begins work on the film Deep Throat, where she first uses her stage name Linda Lovelace.

During a private screening of the film in Los Angeles, Hugh Hefner convinces Linda that she has the potential to be more than a porn actress. Following the screening, Traynor once again forces Linda at gunpoint to participate in a gang bang at a hotel.The next day, she secretly meets up with Romano and tells him she wants out of the porno business, revealing the facial bruises inflicted by Traynor.

She takes a polygraph test prior to publishing her autobiography 'Ordeal', which details her years of Traynor physically and sexually abusing her, as well as controlling all of her earnings. Linda appears on Donahue to talk about her autobiography, with her distraught parents breaking down in tears while watching her on TV. A few days later, the Marcianos travel to Florida for Linda to reconcile with her parents.The film's ending captions reveal that while Deep Throat made over $600 million worldwide, Linda earned only $1,250. 'Ordeal' went on to sell out three printings, and for 20 years, Linda had spoken out against pornography and domestic violence. Traynor went on to marry Marilyn Chambers.

Nymphomaniac: Vol. II,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382009/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The continuation of Joe's sexually dictated life delves into the darker aspects of her adulthood, obsessions and what led to her being in Seligman's care. Joe continues to tell to Seligman the story of her life. Joe lives with Jerôme and their son Marcel and out of the blue, she loses sexual sensation in intercourse. Joe seeks kinky sex, perversions and sadomasochism expecting to retrieve her sex drive. Jerôme leaves home with Marcel and gives his son to a foster house for adoption. Then Joe is sent to therapy by her gynecologist but she does not admit that she is addicted to sex. Meanwhile Seligman tells Joe that he is virgin and helps her to understand her actions. Joe believes that Seligman is her friend, but is he?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil This film is a continuation of Nymphomaniac: Vol. I, split up for length. It does not stand alone and will not make sense without having reviewed the first part.Young Joe (Stacy Martin) is in bed naked, eyes wide open. Jerôme (Shia LaBeouf) is now living with Joe but all of her lovers still try to contact her knocking on the door, calling incessantly. He answers the door. Unplugs the phone. Joe looks out the window to see an empty parking spot where one of her lovers usually parks. Cut to Jerôme and Joe having sex on her bed; she is expressionless.A current day adult Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) explains in narration that when she was 12, she was on a field trip in the hills. In a flashback, we see a young Joe lying alone in fields with nature buzzing all around her. A few classmates are gossiping nearby. All of a sudden, she begins to shake violently and the 12-year-old Joe floats up off the ground. She gets higher and higher and a foggy glow passes over her. Now we see two females levitating beside her in the sky, all illuminated by the same glow on one side is a woman with a veil; on the other is a woman holding a child.In present day, Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) asks Joe if she's kidding him for she had a spontaneous orgasm and had a vision of two women on either side of her. He asks if one was holding a veil with two fingers. He identifies one woman, from her description, as Valeria Messalina, the wife of the emperor Claudius, the most notorious nymphomaniac in history. The other he determines was the Whore of Babylon, riding a nimrod in the form of a bull. He says her story is like a blasphemous retelling of the Transfiguration of Jesus on the Mount, which is one of the Eastern Church's holiest passages. It's when the humanity of Christ is illuminated by the divine light of eternity. If anyone else had told him the story, he would have written it off as a blasphemous joke but Joe clearly didn't know who she had seen in her vision. He explains it started with a spontaneous orgasm and then (years later) she lost her ability to orgasm altogether.We see a naked Young Joe floating above a body of water, rotating lower and lower until she fades away Seligman asks if it was like Wagner's Das Rheingold (Descent into Nibelheim). She tells him to imagine in one swoop that hes lost all desire to read we then see a clothed Seligman floating above a huge pile of books before fading into obscurity.In flashback, Young Joe masturbates late at night, unsuccessfully. She goes to the kitchen and wets a rag and pounds it against her vagina. Jerôme awakens and comforts her as she screams.Seligman compares this to Zenos' paradox; she is Achilles and the tortoise is the orgasm. Because she was giving chase, she couldn't reach satisfaction. Joe tells him he seems like he's not taking this very seriously shes telling him about the worst thing that's ever happened to her, that within seconds, she had lost all sexual sensation and her cunt (how Joe refers to her vagina) went numb. She doubts hes even listening because whenever she tells other men about sexual experiences, it was easy to see they had gotten excited. He says hes gotten excited but she points out only about mathematical crap, not the story. She then realizes he is asexual and cant relate to her stories. He admits he is a virgin. He can read sexual tales Canterbury Tales, or Decameron but only gets literary enjoyment out of it, not sexual. He points out that because he has no preconceived notion, he's the best judge to determine whether she's a bad human being, as she theorizes; he doesn't look at her through glasses colored by sexual experiences because he's a virgin and innocent.Joe notices a painting on a wall of a woman with child. He says the woman was connected to the Eastern Church and explains that the Christian church was split up in 1054 because of differences in opinion between the Eastern Church and Western Church (Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church). The painting depicts a typical Eastern Church icon Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus while the Western Church focuses more on Jesus crucifixion as iconography. He explains, ""To generalize, you could say that the Western Church is the church of suffering and the Eastern Church is the church of happiness. If you imagine a journey from Rome eastward, you're moving away from guilt and pain towards joy and light."" Joe points out he said he didn't believe in God but he says the concept of religion is interesting to him, just like the concept of sex. She decides to call the chapter The Eastern Church and the Western Church but it wont be about traveling east from Rome towards the light but rather the opposite (moving from joy to suffering). So in order to keep it from being too sad, she decides to pep up the name of the chapter with an extra title.CHAPTER SIX: THE EASTERN AND THE WESTERN CHURCH (THE SILENT DUCK)Young Joe's vagina continues to be unresponsive to sex but she is still able to have fun with Jerôme. They are in a restaurant and he offers her five dollars to put a long spoon ""up her cunt."" She goes to the back bar, grabs six more spoons, and shoves them inside herself, one by one. A few patrons take note and look on with disgust. The waiter (Udo Kier) comes back with two ice cream sundaes; he asks if they have spoons since none are on the table. Joe asks for some and he returns with two spoons. They both eat their sundaes. When they are ready to leave, the waiter comes back with Joe's jacket. As she puts it on, a spoon falls out of her dress. As they continue towards the door, more and more spoons clink on the ground.In present day, Joe points out the irony that it was during this period where she couldn't feel any sexual pleasure that she was also experiencing domestic comfort for the first time (since Jerôme had moved in with her). She became pregnant because she was careless about birth control pills. She has to have a Cesarean since she still was hoping sensation would return to her cunt; during the operation, she hears noises from the operation ringing out in the same tune as the one from the Little Flock (determined in the last film to be a Satanic song). She looks at the light fixture overhead and when the baby is pulled out of her, she thinks she sees the baby laughing demonically at her.Seligman points out that Noah's son Ham was laughing when he was born and this is another Satanic omen. Joe names her son Marcel after Mars, the Roman god of war. Seligman asks if maternal love lived up to her expectations but she explains, it was her who had not; maternal love wasn't the problem. But every time she looked in her child's eyes, she had an unsettling feeling of having been found out. In flashback, we see Young Joe playing cautiously with her infant baby, explaining that from her perception, her love wasn't being returned.A naked Jerôme and Young Joe have sex in their bedroom. Even though Young Joe no longer feels pleasure during sex, her nymphomania doesn't stop and she still requires Jerôme to have a lot of sex every day, which eventually becomes laborious for him. She tells him to ""fill all my holes,"" (a flashback to the end of the first film).On a later date, Jerôme tells Joe that he loves her adventurous nature but he isn't able to satisfy her the way she wants to. He wants to continue their sex life but suggests that she should take on lovers again to help satiate her hunger. She kisses him in response. Later, she playfully slaps him.Later, Joe decides to improve her concept of ""fuck me now"" clothes by dressing up as a piano teacher. With some Beethoven sheet music, she is now wearing glasses, her hair in a bun, and frumpy clothes. She stops her car in the middle of a one-way street, pops the hood, and disconnects all the spark plugs. A male driver is stopped behind her. She asks for his help. Now all the men that are delayed by her halted car try to figure out how to plug the spark plugs back in correctly but there are 40,320 combinations. This gives her time to seduce men; a huge crowd gathers around her, discussing topics like Beethoven (her sheet music) while she flirts.Joe comes home to a waiting Jerôme and her son. There is an awkwardness between them. He punches something off the wall, trying to conceal his jealousy. Later, he sits in his car, trying to calm himself down, while we hear Beethoven on the soundtrack.In present day, Joe explains she has to jump ahead three years in the story to depict the suffering Western Church. She tells a story about meeting ""The Dangerous Men."" She (now played by Charlotte Gainsbourg from this point onward) is walking Marcel in a stroller; she explains that Jerôme travels most of the time and when he is finally home, he spends most of his time accusing her of neglecting their son, which she figures is just a cover for his anger over her lovers. She still does not feel sexual satisfaction. Joe passes five African men talking in the park, in a different language. She watches one of them from her window and decides it would turn her on to have a sexual situation in which verbal communication was impossible. She hires a translator to go up to the man she likes and ask him if he wants to have sex with her. He approaches the man. The translator comes back with a note listing a time and a place.Joe ends up at a cheap hotel. The black African man she likes (who she refers to as 'N') enters the room, along with a smaller man. She doesn't speak their language but she gathers N has brought his brother along. Both men undress Joe, speaking to each other the whole time. They observe her and begin to argue over who will have sex with her anally and who will have sex with her vaginally. She finally climbs on top of the guy she likes and begins to ride him. His brother gets upset and they argue. The second man begins to have sex with her from behind while she is on top of his brother. They argue again and toss Joe aside. She sits on the bed, annoyed, while the two bicker back and forth. As a result, she grabs her clothes and leaves the two black men behind in the room who are still arguing with each other. Joe explains to Seligman in voice-over that she later learned that performing a sandwich requires great sensitivity because the men can feel each other through the tissue.In present day, Joe explains that the quarrel had probably started on the stairs when one had laid claim to one of her holes ""which was in conflict with his Negro brothers interest."" Seligman tells her not to use the word because its not politically correct. Joe responds that its always been a mark of honor for her to call a spade a spade and ""each time a word becomes prohibited, you remove a stone from the democratic foundation. Society demonstrates its impotence in the face of the concrete problem by removing words from the language."" Seligman tells her society would claim that political correctness is a very precise expression of democratic concern for minorities. Joe adamantly counters that, ""Society is as cowardly as the people in it who, in my opinion, are also too stupid for democracy."" Seligman disagrees, having no doubt in the human qualities. She explains the human qualities can be expressed in one word hypocrisy. They evaluate those who say right but mean wrong and mock those who say wrong but mean right. She also adds that women who say Negros dont turn them on are lying. The men didn't satisfy her but they showed her there was a world she had to explore and it would be there that she'd get her life back.Joe goes into a waiting room in a seemingly empty building. Two women wait silently besides her. The door opens. A man (Jamie Bell) exits a hallway and observes those waiting; he asks Joe who she is. She tells him that she knows what he does and would like to be one of the women he sees. He refuses and invites another woman in, calling her ""Madame."" A new woman enters the waiting area with flagellation scars all over her legs. The three women sit silently.Eventually, Madame leaves, followed by the man who refers to the new woman as Princess and reminds her he forbid her to return for five days. Without discussion, she stands up and leaves. He then acknowledges Joe again, telling her he doesn't think this is for her. He takes the remaining woman inside the hallway, leaving Joe alone in the waiting room.Seligman asks Joe to explain the mystery of the situation. She calls the man ""K"" and says his business was something she was completely against but because of her rebellious nature, she contacted him as a last desperate attempt to rehabilitate her sexuality. Joe compares Ks violent technique to the Western Church and points out that their systematic approach of the crucifixion is of a violent and sadistic nature.K returns to the hallway where Joe is still waiting. He tells her that she is beginning to irritate him. He asks her to sit completely relaxed while he hits her in the face. K then slaps her aggressively hard. When he moves in again, she flinches. He hits her a second time. She takes a moment but recovers. He agrees to let her join but explains the rules he doesn't fuck her, no exception. They have no safe word so he will not stop no matter what she says. He tells her to bring a brown used leather riding crop and not one from a sex shop but a real one. Finally, he explains the third rule she will have to wait between 2 and 6 PM if she wants to join and it will not be pre-determined when he will call her in. She tells him her babysitters not reliable and she cant leave her child. He begins to walk away. She tells him he doesn't even know her name; he tells her hes not interested and that here, shell be known as Fido. He enters the hallway, leaving Joe alone again.Days later, Joe leaves Marcel with a babysitter. She finally is led into the back room with K. She provides the riding crop. He has Joe tie her hair up in case he needs to hit her in the face. She asks if she should take her clothes off and he says he will tell her what to do and when. He positions a chair and tells her to bend over it. The chair doesn't measure up for K so he has Joe bend over an old couch instead. She bends over one side, on her stomach, and he ties a sort of seat belt over her back, strapping her in. He ties her wrists together and binds the rope to the base of the couch, then duct tapes her ankles and wraps the tape around the other end. He pulls her skirt up and chastises her for wearing knickers. He cant get them around her bound legs so he cuts them off with a pair of scissors. Joe is sobbing on the couch. K is holding the riding crop but tells her that her ass is not high enough and he doesn't think they can do it. He penetrates her ass hole and there is only a small amount of lubrication; he tells her to come back on Thursday. He adds a name tag ""FIDO"" on the riding crop and hangs it in a cabinet alongside three others.Days later, Joe calls the babysitter's answering machine and chastises her for not showing up. She tells her she hopes she gets this message and comes as quickly as she can; she adds that Marcel is sleeping and she has to go now. After contemplation, Joe leaves her sleeping toddler home alone so she can make her appointment with K. He puts a phone book under her crotch to elevate her butt, then binds her again and tightens the seat belt over her back. He penetrates her ass hole again with his finger and is happier with the larger amount of secretion. K tells Joe she's going to hit her 12 times, no matter how much she screams because no one can hear her down there. Before he strikes, she screams out. He tells her, ""That's not how it goes. Most people don't scream until I hit them."" He hits her once. Twice. Three times. She whimpers. Four times. She is in unbearable pain. Five times. Six times. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. She is whimpering. He tells her, ""That's it."" She thanks him and he tells her she's very welcome.In present day, Joe tells Seligman she doesn't know where they get their sexuality from or where tendencies of that kind come from but probably a perversion in their childhood that never manifested itself before. Seligman points out that Freud says the opposite that there is a polymorphic perversion of a child and we use childhood to remove or diminish some of them, that a child is polymorphic and everything is sexuality in an infant. But Joe said it was deeply bizarre to lie there and want to lie there. Seligman points out that it lubricated an expectation for pain that she hadn't experienced; her body prepared herself for an intercourse that she knew wouldn't happen. Joe describes the mood as sexual and while she twisted and turned during the whipping, she realized how clever his knots were if she fought them, they would get tighter and as she relaxed, it seemed they did, too. Seligman tells her about the Prusik knot, named after a mountain climber named Prusik. His friend and him had a mountain climbing accident and his friend died; he ended up hanging at the end of a rope with no possibility of getting out since you cant climb up a thin mountain climbers rope. He took the shoelaces out of his shoes and made two loops and affixed them to the rope. And he could move these up since they weren't under tension and he could step into them and climb the rope and save himself. Joe tells Seligman this is one of his weakest digressions.She continues her story K fills a rubber glove with coins and then puts it on his hand. He slaps Joe hard with the coin-filled glove. After she gets naked, he tells her he's going to give her a Christmas present but she has to do the work herself. He ties a blood knot into a rope and tells her she needs to make nine ropes with blood knots on each. When she has completed this, he balls up some fabric and shoves it in her mouth.Joe returns to her apartment to find Marcel asleep safely in his crib. She breathes a sigh of relief.Days later, Joe is in the waiting room with two other women, checking her watch. The three-year-old Marcel hears a snowplow outside and wakes up. He crawls out of his crib and runs towards the balcony. When Jerôme arrives home later, he discovers his son on the outside patio, unmonitored.Joe and Jerôme are sitting by the fireplace. He asks her if she's still more fond of him than the others and wonders if she's going to leave tonight. She tells him no but he accuses her of lying to him. He says if she leaves tonight, she'll never see Marcel or himself ever again.That night, Joe struggles with a compulsion to leave to meet with K. Jerôme asks if she's saying goodbye and points out she's not a mother. He wakes up Marcel who begins crying and reaching out to Joe. He points out that it's Christmas but she leaves anyway.Joe bypasses the waiting room and walks in on K with a woman; she tells him that ""Today, it is Madame who must wait."" K asks Madame to leave. Joe reaches out to K and kisses him but he pulls away. He gives Joe the Christmas present he's kept in his desk. She unwraps it it is a flog built with the nine pieces of rope. She places it on a chair and bends over the couch. She tells him, ""I want your cock."" She reaches out for K's pants but he backs away. He leaves her tied up to the couch for a while. Finally, he picks up the flog and says on account of the holiday and her behavior, he's going to give her the original Roman maximum of 40 lashes. He begins lashing Joe across her ass several times. She has figured out K's knot technique so she has become able to loosen her position to move her pelvis and is able to stimulate her clitoris against the phone book he had to place under her for height. The lashing continues as classical music plays on the soundtrack. He finally reaches 40 and she screams out in agony; this is juxtaposed with the image of the 12-year-old Joe levitating in the air towards an ethereal glow.Seligman predicts that when she comes home, Jerôme and her child were gone. She confirms that she hasn't seen Marcel since. In anger, she throws a teacup against the wall. Joe tells Seligman that Jerôme said he couldn't prioritize a child into his life either so he put Marcel into a foster home somewhere in rural England. Her only contact with her son is the £1,000 she puts into his account every month. Seligman asks what happened to the silent duck, as Joe has forgotten. One night, K had been in a good mood and said he'd introduce her to the concept of the silent duck. K bunches up his fingers and makes his thumb like a mouth (like you would in a sock puppet), puts it in his mouth, and then puts his fist up Joe's anus. Seligman imagines hundreds of ducks quacking.Joe notices Seligman's mirror and asks if he's ready for another chapterCHAPTER SEVEN: THE MIRRORSet another year or so later, Joe is seen masturbating on a toilet at work. She begins bleeding from her clitoris after years of self-abuse. Joe leaves the bathroom and passes several co-workers who give her dirty looks. Her female boss has set up a meeting to discuss rumors about Joe that are going around the office that she sees men every evening and spends long nights with them. That she can't be trusted and will steal everyone's men. Joe admits she can't keep away from her coworkers men. The boss says she's spoken with a psychologist and her addiction can be treated in a therapy group. She demands Joe go, even though she doesn't want to, pointing out that this problem will persist her in any workplace.When asked about why she refused to go into therapy by Seligman, Joe reveals a very troubling story to him. A year after leaving Jerôme and worried about another pregnancy, Joe stops using birth control and finds herself impregnated by one of her lovers. She demands her physician remove the fetus immediately, which he doesn't and tells her that, to get an abortion, she must have a consultation with a psychiatrist. The meeting with the psychiatrist goes disastrously as Joe clashes with her over what she wants and what the psychiatrist thinks is best. In haste, Joe sterilizes and prepares several tools, takes a mixture of pills and vodka and, using the information she had acquired from her time in medical school, performs the abortion herself in her kitchen, eventually pulling the eleven week fetus out with a wire hanger. At first too shocked to answer, Seligman politely states that he feels for how Joe must have felt in that moment while stressing his need to not know how she did it. Almost offended by his opinion and his desire to not know the exact methods, Joe and Seligman clash over talks of abortion rights, the morality of abortion and killing animals for food and additional tools for removing the fetus before Joe talks about how she and her father would save snails on the walking trail from certain doom. Eventually, heads are cooled and Joe returns to where she left off in her story.Joe is in the therapy group filled with women who consider themselves sex addicts. Joe calls herself a nymphomaniac, although the moderator convinces her to use ""sex addict"" and that there, everyone is the same under that description. After the meeting, Joe has stayed to talk with the moderator Joe repeats the woman's theory that nobody can remove their sexuality even if its destroying their lives. The moderator clarifies, maybe one in a million sex addicts could live a life without sexuality and so her therapy isn't to cure them but to remove exposure. She suggests Joe determine what incentives she has (from expressing her nymphomania) and make it difficult to come in contact with them. Joe needs to get rid of anything that makes her think of sex so Joe goes home and cuts up the phone line, throws away books, gets rid of everything in the bathroom, tosses paintings, mirrors. She even paints over a bigger mirror so she cant see the glass, tapes newspapers over the windows so she cant see men walking by. Now her apartment is completely empty except for the herbarium she started as a kid (a book of plant pressings). She flips through the pages, licking her finger to turn each page. She begins licking her finger more sensuously and then performs fellatio on several fingers. It becomes apparent she can get rid of everything and the nymphomania wont disappear.In the therapy group, Joe tells the group she hasn't had sex for three weeks and five days. She has brought notes to tell them how she did it. After starting her speech, telling them that they're all alike, she looks in a nearby mirror and sees her 10-year-old self seated in the auditorium, watching her. The moderator asks if she wants a glass of water; she does. Joe still cannot start her speech, constantly glancing at the 10-year-old in the mirror (who she's betraying by denouncing her nymphomania). The moderator asks if she'd rather share another time. Joe looks again at the vision in the mirror, then tears up her speech and recites a new one on the fly she tells the group they are not all alike pointing out one woman who fucks to validated, another who just wants to be filled up in any capacity, and the moderator isn't empathetic but is acting like society's morality police whose duty it is to erase Joe's obscenity from the earth. She explains she's not like them she is a nymphomaniac and loves herself for being one; she loves her cunt and her filthy, dirty lust. Joe walks away from the shaken-up group.Cut to Joe randomly setting a car on fire inside of a large mansion.In present day, Seligman asks what happened. Joe apologizes for being in a hurry to get to the last chapter. Joe says that she finally realized society had no room for her and she had no room for society and never had. She looks around the room and cannot find an inspiration for a story heading for the next chapter. Seligman tells her text can sometimes seem empty and she might need to change her point of view. Things hide when they get familiar but if you look at them at another angle, they might take on new meaning. We see a vagina rotated and it turns into an eyeball. Joe turns her head and notices a stain on the wall from where her tea splashed against the wall. She asks Seligman if he sees what she sees he identifies the stain as a revolver but Joe explains that its a pistol because a revolver has a drum that revolves. It becomes clear Joe is very well versed in guns she identifies the stain as a Walther PPK automatic, which she recalls seeing in a Bond film. Joe explains that this is definitely something she can use for her chapter heading.CHAPTER EIGHT: THE GUNBack to Joe setting a car on fire. She walks away. Joe tells Seligman she doesn't know if she left society or it left her but she was now resorting to ""debt collecting"" (extortion) for a living. That's why she has burned someone's car.For a long time, she's known about a man named 'L'. She knocks on the door and meets L (Willem Dafoe), a gruff middle-aged man, for the first time. He knows who she is and thinks she has excellent qualifications. She points out that she can't have an office job because her nymphomania conflicts with it. He suggests that she starts her own business, with his help. She has a great insight on a broad spectrum of men and he suggests it be capitalized on. He needs subcontractors who can put moderate pressure on individuals with whom his clients have a bone to pick. Basically, he wants her to extort men who owe money but he uses the term ""debt collector"". He also encourages her to dissuade perspective on whether the clients wishes are justified or not.Joe's skills with men and sex, as well as specialized skills (like learning to tie a blood knot) make her a great debt collector. A man is tied to a table with his pants down. She goes to hit him with the knot; when he flinches, she repeats what K originally told her ""This is not how it goes. You have to wait until you're hit.""The next gig we see is her with two ""helpers"" in a very exquisite mansion, owned by a man in a suit who seems disinterested in the havoc they're causing. The henchmen destroy some of his things but the man doesn't seem to care. Joe is unable to read him sexually so she orders the henchmen to tie him to a chair. She pulls down his pants and explains that all men come with built-in truth tellers (i.e., whether his penis becomes erect or not). She tries various stories to see what will arouse him stories of sado-masochism, homosexuality, etc. He doesn't react to anything. So, as a last ditch effort, she tells him a story about him walking through the park and hearing something. The man begins to get erect. She realizes he is imagining hearing children on a playground and makes up an imaginary boy playing in the sandpit who looks at him, sits on his lap, asks if he can come home with him. The man's erection begins to grow. She continues the story ""when you're home, you can't fight the idea of being naked together"". The man finally agrees to pay, in order to make her stop. He begins sobbing, ashamed. After a moment, Joe gets on her knees and performs oral sex on the man's erect penis.In the present, Seligman is confused. Joe tells him that she took pity on him for having just destroyed his life. Nobody knew his secret, maybe not even himself. She points out that he had succeeded in suppressing his desire and never given into it, right up until she forced it out. He had lived a life full of denial and never hurt a soul, which she considers laudable. Seligman can't relate and she points out he is thinking of the five percent (of pedophiles) who hurt children; the remaining 95 percent never live out their fantasies. She tells him to think about their suffering, given that sexuality is the strongest force in human beings. To be born with a forbidden sexuality must be agonizing. ""The pedophile who manages to get through life with the shame of his desire while never acting on it deserves a bloody medal,"" Joe tells him. She also admits she related to the man because she identified with his loneliness for being a sexual outcast.Some years pass and Joe's loan and collection business grows, allowing her to make higher amounts of anonymous deposits to Marcel. L tells her her business is doing great, she completes all the jobs he gives her to perfection, and the clients have nothing but praise for her.... but since she's getting older (Joe is now in her mid-to-late 40's), she has to start thinking about a successor. He tells her the process of finding her replacement involves finding a young teenager, finding out what parents are incarcerated, leaving a void in their child's life, and then find out where the kid plays football (U.S. soccer) and ""you get involved, cheering them on, no matter how bad they are the worse the better"". That way, Joe will take on the role of a foster parent until she has a loyal helper that will walk through fire for her, even do jail time for her. Joe isn't keen on the idea but L points out that at the least, she would provide parenting for a kid who would otherwise go without any. He's already found a suitable subject: a 15-year-old girl from a family of hardened criminals who has already been institutionalized. Her mother recently died of a drug overdose and her father is in prison. She plays basketball, very badly; she's chosen a team sport because she's lonely. And her right ear is slightly deformed which she's very ashamed of and this isolates her even more and makes her an easy target for a bit of affection or empathy.Joe has been talked into having a look and she attends a high school basketball game. She feels repulsed by the plan but nonetheless cheers for the teen girl with the deformed ear, who seems very sad and vulnerable (she also is sure to keep her right ear hidden under her hair). She calls the girl P (Mia Goth) and being around her fills her with pity and emotion and she finds herself attending each game every weekend.After a game, P approaches Joe and thanks her for cheering for her. Joe tells P she played really good and that she's been improving. Joe takes P to the same park that her father (Christian Slater) taught her about trees having souls, when she was 10. The ten-year-old Joe points out that the souls of the trees look like human souls and her dad agrees they look like twisted souls, regular souls, crazy souls, all depending on the lives human beings lead. He has found his soul tree he shows it to her, an oak tree in the shape of a Y. In the park, Joe tells P that she had never found her own soul tree but her dad had told her shed know it when she sees it.A few years later, when P becomes the age of majority (age 17 or 18) and Joe becomes her personal adviser, she asks P to move in with her. In their home, Joe convinces P to put her hair up and she is comfortable enough with Joe to let her right ear be exposed. At this time, all of Joe's sexual activity had stopped and her groin was one big sore from her abuse that wouldn't heal and it makes even masturbation impossible. Joe experiences abstinence symptoms fever and cramps. She is in horrible pain every evening. One night, Joe wakes up from sleep in chronic pain to get a drink of water and some aspirin. In the bathroom, she drops the glass on the floor and it shatters. P awakens and helps her clean up the broken pieces. P then helps Joe up off the floor and to bed where she gives her some aspirin and another glass of water and Joe goes to sleep.In the present, Seligman asks if P really loved her. Joe says she couldn't accept it.In the flashback, P takes care of Joe while she's resting, still in severe pain, the morning after the incident. P wants to see what Joe's vagina looks like since it's hurting her greatly. Joe argues her not to look, but P replies that she also has a deformity with her ear and wants to see. P looks at Joe's vagina and notices all the bruises from years of sexual activity as well as her Cesarean scar from when she gave birth. It makes her aware of how sexual Joe used to be. P undresses and asks if Joe likes her. Joe tells her she's beautiful. P gets into bed and begins to kiss Joe and all over her naked body (carefully avoiding her groin area). Joe only responds by crying.Seligman asks if P knew what Joe did for a living (debt collecting). Joe explains that P never asked about her work and was a very discrete person.But one day, in the park, P asked Joe why she started coming to her basketball matches and guesses it wasn't a coincidence. Joe tells her she's right and that she didn't tell her because she didn't want her to be upset with her. Joe tells P that her job is illegal. P points out that no one in her family does anything legal. Joe says a man ('L') that worked in her business suggested she become friends with P to see if she could use her in her line of work. P tells her not to feel bad because if she hadn't, they'd never have met. She asks Joe if she can go to work with her on her next assignment; the two of them kiss. P playfully begs Joe again to let her go... marking the beginning a lesbian romance between Joe and P.Seligman explains that social inheritance is irrefutable and if anybody knew about the laws of the street (and be appropriate for extortion), it must have been P. Joe confirms he is right.P is now working alongside Joe and the two henchmen. But she takes an overly aggressive approach to the victim, threatening him with a gun, forcing Joe to yell at her. Later at home, Joe tells P they don't use violence and demands the gun. P tells her guns aren't dangerous if used correctly and that she wasn't going to shoot someone because then they'd have gotten no money out of him. Joe still demands the gun and P hands it over. Joe loads a magazine. When she returns to P, she is pouting and says Joe is evil.In a weird coincidence, Joe and P go to a debtor's house and sees a name on the door: Jerôme Morris. Taken aback, Joe suggests P do this one alone. She tells P to make sure nothing is destroyed and nobody is hurt; she should just show herself and offer him a reasonable payment plan. P rings the bell and enters the house with the two henchmen (because a good 15 years have passed, Jerôme is now played by an older actor, not Shia LaBeouf). Joe no longer knows if she still feels love for Jerôme but she definitely experiences a feeling that is far stronger than she would have liked.Joe walks home through the same alley where Seligman first discovered her; she had learned the shortest route from Jerôme's house to her place is the alley. Later that night, P comes home and tells her it went brilliantly and that he made a reasonable payment plan. Joe asks how he looked and P responds, ""scared."" Joe asks how old he looked and she says, ""I don't know ancient."" P plants kisses on Joe's neck, then gets naked and jumps into bed with her for some more casual lesbian lovemaking.Joe explains that Jerôme was to pay off his debt in six payments. Every time P goes to his house to collect, Joe is nervous (that they'll become sexually involved) and is restless until P returns. She even begins playing solitaire, just like her mother did, in order to make the hours pass. Each night, she's less assured of P coming home than the night before; she is beginning to feel jealousy and doesn't know if it's the fear of sharing or the fear of losing P. But this unworthy feeling she hadn't felt her whole life (since Joe used to live a life with sex void of love) was now creeping up on her. With the 50-year-old Joe now having romantic feelings for a 19-year-old girl, makes Joe very confused.Some months later, the evening P was to collect the final payment, she doesn't kiss Joe goodbye. This makes Joe suspicious, especially when hours and hours go by. She lays in bed, expecting P to arrive every time she sees a car light in her window. Finally, Joe walks to Jerôme's house. She sees the two henchmen asleep in a car parked out front. Through the window, she sees a naked P in the kitchen of the house drinking from a wine bottle. Jerôme creeps up behind her in an embrace. The two wander out of sight.Joe walks home, having made the decision to flee since she can't stay in this town with P and Jerôme so close by. She begins to head south (because north would require her to turn around and face the town she is abandoning); she has an impulse to climb a large hill that she passes. When she gets to the top, she sees a large deformed oak tree completely alone her soul tree.Joe explains that its said to be difficult to take a person's life but for her, it seemed more difficult not to. She continues, ""For a human being, killing is the most natural thing in the world; were created for it."" In the flashback, Joe takes the gun she has confiscated from P out of the closet. She crosses back through the alleyway and is stopped short when she hears Jerôme laughing. She rushes back to find Jerôme and P horsing around in the alley. They begin kissing. Jerôme then walks right past Joe who points her gun and pulls the trigger but it fails to go off. She tries again but it still simply clicks. There is a moment when Jerôme realizes that she has attempted to kill him. Joe stands silently, left alone with the awkwardness of having been unsuccessful. After some time, Jerôme decks Joe hard in the face, so she collapses on the ground. P watches on, silently. Without any discussion, Jerôme continues to kick and punch Joe. He turns and looks back at P who responds by pulling down her pants and getting on top of a trashcan. Jerôme approaches and penetrates her three times vaginally (we see it written as 1 + 2 + 3, just like when Jerôme took Joe's virginity) and then five times anally (like in the first film, shown on the screen as 3 + 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Now we see 3 + 5 on the screen over Joe laying hurt on the ground; the special numerical sequence that tied her to the only man she ever had romantic feelings towards. P saunters over to Joe on the ground and urinates on her. P walks away. Jerôme observes Joe a little longer, sympathetically, and then follows. He is out of earshot but Joe says, ""Fill all my holes, please"" (what she had said to Jerôme when they first moved in together).The story has now come full circle since this was the condition and location Seligman discovered Joe in. In present day, Joe tells Seligman she still doesn't know why the gun didn't work. She had checked to make sure there were bullets in the magazine and shed taken off the safety; it simply malfunctioned just like Bond's Beretta (hinting again that she is well versed on guns). Seligman points out that you can't shoot a Walther PPK, semi-automatic .38 caliber gun until you rack the gun; you pull and release the sliding mechanism. P hadn't done it because she had no intention of shooting the man during her first assignment. He also pointed out that from Bond films, it must be apparent that you have to rack an automatic pistol. Joe admits he's right and that she's seen it in films a thousand times (hinting that she knew subconsciously that she wasn't going to kill Jerôme and should feel less guilty).Seligman notes that it's morning and the sun is rising (having been up all night listening to Joe's life story). Joe looks out the window; Seligman tells her he can never figure out where it comes from (because his window looks out onto an enclosed alleyway, leaving only a sliver of sunlight). Joe says its beautiful and stares at the spot of sun in the darkness.Cut to a shot of a sunset. Seligman reminds her (and us) that in the beginning, Joe had said her only sin was that she asked more of the sunset. He expresses that this must mean she asks more from life than what is good for her. We see a montage of Joe as a child rubbing against the bathroom tiles, looking up an anatomy book at 10 years old, approaching Jerôme to take her virginity as a young teen. Seligman tells her she was a human being and a woman demanding her rights. He points out that if two men had walked down a train looking for women (like she and B did as teens), nobody would have raised an eyebrow. Or if a man had led the sexual life she had. Or how banal the story of Mrs. H would be if Joe was a man and her conquest was a woman.Seligman explains that when a man leaves his children for desire, we accept it as a shrug but as a woman, she had to take on a burden of guilt that could never alleviated. And all in all, all the blame and guilt piled up over the years became too much for her and she reacted aggressively, almost like a man (lighting cars on fire, etc.), and she fought back against the gender that had been oppressing and mutilating and killing her and billions of women. She points out she wanted to kill a human being flash back to her kissing Jerôme as a young adult, romantically. He points out she didnt kill him; she points out this was only because of a chance event. He says hed call it subconscious resistance; the veil of forgetfulness draped itself over her knowledge of how to rack a gun.Joe says she's too tired to debate. Seligman suggests she lay down and she does. Before she sleeps, she lets Seligman know that, by letting her tell her story, he put her at ease; she adds that, at this moment, her addiction is very clear to her and she's come to the conclusion that even if only one in a million can succeed in mentally and bodily ridding themselves of their sexuality, it is now her goal. Seligman asks her if its a life worth living; she tells him its the only way she can live. She says, ""I will start up against all odds just like a deformed tree on a hill. I will master all my stubbornness, my strength, my masculine aggression."" Joe also thanks Seligman for being her newest, and maybe first, friend. She says she's happy the shot didn't go off and make her a murderer. She then asks Seligman to leave so she can sleep. He says he'll make sure she isn't disturbed.After Seligman asks Joe if she will contemplate contacting Marcel, they say goodnight to each other and he shuts the door. Joe turns off the light and rolls over to sleep. Moments later, Seligman returns into the darkened room. He walks curiously over to the sleeping Joe. It is revealed Seligman is not wearing pants (although he has on a shirt). He touches his penis and walks over to Joe, preparing to rape her. She sits up in bed, noticing what he's doing. She tells him ""NO!"" and grabs the gun, racking immediately. The screen turns to black and we hear him tell her, ""But you fucked thousands of men."" A gunshot is heard. A body falls to the floor. In darkness, we hear Joe put her clothes on and hurriedly rush from the room. Loud footsteps reverberate down the corridor as Joe runs out of the apartment, down the building stairs and out the front door.Charlotte Gainsbourg's cover of the 60s rock song, Hey Joe plays over the end credits."

Franck falls in love with Michel, an attractive, potent and lethally dangerous man. Franck knows this but wants to live out his passion anyway. Franck, a fit gay man, seeks love at a lakeside gay cruising beach. Among the mostly pudgy nude sunbathers, he befriends Henri, a depressed middle-aged bi-sexual who enjoys the quiet but accepts Franck's company. When Michel appears, Franck finally spots a man he'd like to know sexually. Unfortunately, he also spots him drowning his gay lover but opts not to tell anyone in order to consider having a relationship with this handsome yet remorseless killer.—statmanjeff As he has done summers before, Franck has started to go to the lakeside unofficial clothes optional beach for the season, it and the adjacent woods which are well known gay cruising areas. The predominantly gay men who frequent the area generally go alone in not wanting to publicize their cruising activities within their day to day social circles, and as such little of real depth or meaning is usually spoken among the men in their casual encounters here. Franck goes for the entire experience the area has to offer: swimming in the lake, nude tanning on the beach, and generally anonymous sexual encounters with other gay men in the woods. Of the many men Franck encounters this season, two end up playing significant roles in his experience here. The first is Henrí, a slightly older, overweight loner, an implied bisexual who stays on the beach fully clothed in the want for seeming solitude to deal with the issues in his life. Henrí and Franck enter into as close a friendship as generally occurs here, neither who is attracted to or thus interested in the other sexually. The second is Michel, to who Franck is immediately attracted above all the others, that lust which borders on what Franck ultimately believes is love. By their second sexual encounter, Franck and Michel have become exclusive in their lake meetings. While Franck would like their relationship to be more than just at the lake, Michel wants to keep it solely as a lake relationship. Franck secretly witnesses an incident, his and his fellow beach goers' reaction to that incident which highlights the priority they place on maintaining the area in all its private gay glory, that shown to an extreme for Franck in maintaining a relationship with Michel despite having seen exactly what happened.—Huggo"

Ryota is forced to make a life-changing decision, to choose between 'nature' and 'nurture.'

Ryota is very competitive and struggles that his son is not and he creates hard feelings with his wife when he learns Keita is not his son and blurts out that that explains ii to his wife. MIdori had chosen to go to a country hospital near where she grew up so she would be close to her family when giving birth as she knew her workaholic husband would not be much use. MIdori is also held responsible for her choice of the hospital where the mix-up occurred. Ryota also implies that as the child's mother she should have recognized that the baby wasn't hers.
The hospital and their lawyers arrange for genetic testing of the children to establish parentage. The mix-up was discovered when one of the other boys was tested prior to entering school and it was revealed he was not related to his parents. The two families are brought together and the other couple are small business people, Yudai and Yukara, with a repair shop they live at and two other younger children. MIdori had problems during birth and can have no more children. YUkara also has a job in a food shop. The two families are in very different economic situations and the father Yudai seems very interested in the potential financial settlement from the hospital. When the families meet the two boys are very dissimilar, Keita is smaller and more reserved and Ryosei is larger and outgoing. The lawyers and advisors all agree that the families should exchange the boys back to their real families. The two mothers are not certain and form a bond and alliance knowing that Ryota is the most forceful of the group. MIdori's mother is also troubled by the thought of exchanging the boys knowing how attached her daughter is to the boy.
Ryota has a difficult relationship with his own father and his dad advises him that blood is important in families and horse breeding and is adamant that Ryota get his true son back. RYota's parents had separated and he had attempted to run away from his father who has custody and go back to his mother but his father brought him back. It turns out that he and his brother were raised lovingly by his step-mom.
At the court proceedings the hospital nurse confesses to swapping the babies in some confused reaction to her raising her husbands children from a previous marriage. The other 3 parents are angry with the nurse but Ryota is more interested in getting his real son back.
RYota, realizing that MIdori doesn't want to give up Keita, comes up with a scheme to offer the poorer family money and allow him and MIdori to raise both boys. Yudai and Yukara are offended and the plans proceed for the ultimate exchange. As a start, the families swap the boys on weekends over a series of months. Ryota describes this switching off of the boys as a mission that they have to undertake. It is obvious that the two families and their style of living and child rearing are quite different.
After the exchange, Ryosei is not very happy without his siblings and his new father is much more remote and always working. Ryosei eventually runs away and goes back to his previous home and Ryota goes and retrieves him. Yukara facetiously suggests that maybe her and Yudai should keep both the boys.
Ryota begins to reevaluate his behavior and his boss at work asks him to take a job that will free up his time for his family. Ryota and MIdori try to entertain Ryosei but he still expresses the desire to be with his other family. The three drive out to the repair shop and Ryosei announces that he is back home. Keita runs out the back and Ryota follows him. Ryota confesses he has not been a very good father and that he had failures and was too hard with his expectations. He announces the mission is over and hugs his son."

He has no contact with his sister, and his parents were murdered ten years prior. When he gets word that his parents' killer, Wade Cleland, is set to be released from prison, Dwight decides that he has nothing left to lose and sets out on a quest to avenge his parents' deaths. Dwight succeeds in killing Wade, but complications emerge when his botched getaway allows the Cleland family the opportunity to vow revenge.—A Guy Dwight (Macon Blair) is a beach vagrant, with dirty, stringy hair, living out of his car and scavenging through trash cans and dumpsters for food and money. A policewoman finds Dwight asleep in his junker car and gives him the news that Wade Cleland, the man who murdered his parents, is soon to be released from prison. Dwight watches as Wade is released from prison. Dwight steals a gun, but wrecks it trying to get the gun lock out of it; he throws it in the garbage. He then procures a knife. Dwight confronts Wade in a club's rest room and, after a brief fight, fatally stabs him in the temple.While trying to escape after the killing, Dwight realizes he left his car keys in the rest room with Wade's body. Dwight's hand is bloody from stabbing the Cleland Gang limousine tire, and steals the Cleland Gang's limousine. Dwight finds a teenage boy (David W. Thompson) in the rear of the limousine, and he stops and lets the boy out, admitting the crime. Dwight cleans up all the blood, cuts off his stringy hair, and now looks a pudgy ""regular person,"" nothing like the beach vagrant who committed the murder. After cleaning up his looks, he visits his sister, Sam (Amy Hargreaves), for the first time in several years. Over an emotional conversation in a cafe, Dwight reveals that he killed Wade. His sister is shocked, but appears happy with the news. Dwight also says he assumed she would have heard about the murder on the news, then realizing that the story hasn't been on the news. This means that the Cleland Gang never contacted the police, and they are likely seeking their own revenge on Dwight. Because of this, Sam takes her two daughters and flees.While his sister is gone, Dwight waits in her house for the inevitable attack from the Clelands. Two attackers break into the house, one with a cross-bow weapon. Dwight gets to his car, and he manages to run over one of the attackers, Teddy (Kevin Kolack). He is shot in the leg with an arrow by the other attacker, but he chases the attacker off. Dwight then drags Teddy's unconscious body into the trunk of his car. He attempts home surgery on his arrow wound, but he is unable to extract it. Ultimately, he collapses in the waiting room of a local hospital. After waking up in the hospital, with the wound repaired, he leaves the building in his hospital johnny, and finds his hidden car. He bangs on the trunk, and Teddy bangs back. Dwight leaves Teddy in the trunk, and he drives to meet Ben Gaffney (Devin Ratray), an old high school friend. Dwight persuades Ben to lend him a rifle. Dwight then goes out to his car in a field. There, he unlocks the trunk and negotiates with Teddy, who is sitting in the trunk, with Dwight pointing the rifle at Teddy from a few yards away. Dwight tries to get Teddy to guarantee that the Clelands will leave his sister alone.During the conversation between Dwight and Teddy, it is revealed that Wade was not his parent's killer. It was, in fact, Wade's father, who has now died of cancer. Wade's father's motive was that Dwight's father was having an affair with his wife. Dwight's mother was killed accidentally. As their father was dying from cancer, the Clelands didn't want him to die in prison so Wade took the blame. Dwight tells Teddy to call his family to arrange a meeting to end their feud. Teddy leaps from the trunk and manages to wrestle Dwight's rifle from him. As Teddy is aiming the rifle at Dwight lying on the ground, Ben appears off in the distance. With a single shot from far away, Ben kills Teddy. Ben and Dwight return to Ben's house, where Dwight borrows a smaller weapon. He then drives off, heading for the Cleland's house. We see that Dwight has disabled Ben's car by taking the battery with him in order to keep Ben from getting involved any further. At the Clelands, Dwight searches for all the guns in the house, and he throws them in the nearby water. He urinates on the grave of Wade's father, but he also digs a grave for Teddy, and buries him. He leaves a message on the answering machine and hides, waiting for the Clelands to return.The Cleland family returns, a man and two women. They listen to the message from Dwight. In the message, Dwight asks them to leave his sister alone, as the score is now equal in terms of family members murdered. When it's clear that the Clelands won't agree to this, Dwight emerges, and he shoots the man. Unbeknownst to Dwight, the teenage boy from the limousine is also there, and he makes his way around towards Dwight, ultimately shooting Dwight in the belly with a shotgun. Dwight hits the boy's shotgun away and states that he has ""done his job"", as Dwight thinks that he (Dwight) will die from the shotgun wound. Dwight tells the boy to leave and take Dwight's car in the woods. Dwight tells the boy that he (Dwight) is actually the boy's half brother (from the affair between the parents). In a rage, the older of the two women reaches under a recliner, and grabs a machine gun hidden there that Dwight had missed. There's very rapid gunfire. Dwight kills the remaining two women and, while lying on the floor spitting blood from his mouth, repeatedly whispers ""the keys are in the car""."

But meaning is what he already craves. Qohen Leth (Christoph Waltz), an eccentric programmer who refers to himself in plurals, is assigned to ""crunch entities"" for a company named Mancom. Finding himself suffering existential angst, Qohen constantly waits for a phone call, hoping that it might bring him happiness or the answers he seeks. Requesting a psych evaluation, three company doctors determine that Qohen is physically healthy, but request he have therapy from Dr Shrink-Rom (Tilda Swinton), an AI therapist designed to provide mental evaluation. Wanting to meet with ""Management"" (Matt Damon), Qohen attends a party held by his supervisor, Joby (David Thewlis). Stumbling into an empty room, Qohen finds Management and requests to work from home, as he would be more productive and would no longer risk missing his call; Management simply notes he finds Qohen ""quite insane.""Attempting to leave the party, Qohen is pressed into staying by Joby and, when Qohen starts choking on an olive, he is rescued by partygoer Bainsley (Mélanie Thierry). His request granted by Management, Qohen is informed he is to start working from home, and is shown a massive supercomputer dubbed ""The Neural Net Mancive""; containing all of the entities crunched by workers, Qohen is required to order its data to solve the ""Zero Theorem"", a mysterious mathematical formula. Spending months as a hermit whilst working on the program, Dr. Shrink-Rom diagnoses him with numerous conditions, and he begins suffering nightmares involving a black hole.Frustrated with his work, Qohen smashes his computer with a hammer, and is soon visited by Bainsley. Qohen confides with Bainsley that he believes he accidentally hung up a call that would have given him the meaning of life, and has desperately been waiting for a call-back ever since. Qohen is then visited by Bob (Lucas Hedges), the teenage son of Management. Bob repairs his computer, reveals Management is spying on him, and suggests that Bainsley is only interested in Qohen because she is paid to be. After Qohen insists he will cease working on the zero theorem, Bob promises to get him his call if he continues. Having received an AI suit from Bainsley, Qohen interacts with her through virtual reality; appearing on a beach together, they soon kiss one another.Visited again by Bob, Qohen, to his distaste, learns the zero theorem aims to prove life is meaningless through the Big Crunch theory.

Qohen is visited by Bainsley, who apologizes for deceiving him, but claims she is truly fell in love with him; despite Bainsley's offer to elope, which is encouraged by Bob, Qohen turns her down.Qohen, discussing his problems with Bob, discovers Bob's health is radically declining. Caring for Bob, Qohen finds a hidden camera in his bathroom mirror, and begins to uncover and smash Management's cameras. Despite barricading his home, Management employees break in and take Bob. Visited by Joby, Qohen is berated as his actions got him fired. Wearing his now repaired suit, Qohen connects to his computer, but is electrocuted. Appearing at the Neural Net Mancive, Qohen is greeted by Management, who notes that Bob is hospitalized, and that he suffers from a chronic illness. Management explains Qohen is part of the Neural Net now and, when Qohen asks questions about the meaning of his life, Management shrugs them off. Management explains he chose Qohen as he had faith in a phone call giving his life meaning, effectively making him the antithesis of the zero theorem. Management then disappears, apologizing as he no longer needs Qohen; angered, Qohen smashes the Neural Net, collapsing it and revealing a black hole inside. Smiling, Qohen drops into it, only to appear back on the virtual beach. Qohen stands in the sea and watches the sun set."

In a nostalgic childhood memoir, octogenarian directorAlejandro Jodorowskyreturns to coastal Tocopilla, his hometown in the Chilean desert. Through illusion, dream-like sequences, mysticism, and New Age metaphors, Jodorowsky portrays vividly his loving mother and his authoritarian father who wanted to make a man out of him, recounting the days of innocence against the backdrop of an eccentric, intricate dance of reality.—Nick Riganas The legendary filmmaker was born in 1929 in Tocopilla, a coastal town on the edge of the Chilean desert where the film was shot. It was there that Jodorowsky underwent an unhappy and alienated childhood as part of an uprooted family. Blending his personal history with metaphor, mythology and poetry, The Dance of Reality reflects Alejandro Jodorowsky's philosophy that reality is not objective but rather a dance created by our own imaginations.—Singh Young Alejandro (Jeremías Herskovits) lives with his Jewish-Ukrainian parents Jaime (Brontis Jodorowsky) and Sara (Pamela Flores) in Tocopilla, Chile. Jaime is a communist who worships Stalin and raises his son with great severity. Sara sings rather than talks throughout the film, and believes Alejandro to be the reincarnation of her father because of his long blonde hair. Irritated by his wife's delusional views of their son and angered by Alejandro's behavior, which he views as cowardly and effeminate, Jaime cuts off Alejandro's hair (which is depicted as wig in what appears to be magic realism), demands he repudiate the existence of God, and puts him through tests of self-control and bravery which include withstanding being tickled, slapped, and finally undergoing a dental operation without anesthetic. Satisfied with his son's bravery, Jaime acknowledges that he respects Alejandro and arranges for him to be made the mascot of the Tocopilla fire brigade.Alejandro accompanies the fire brigade to the scene of a fire where one of the firemen becomes trapped in the house and burns to death. During the subsequent funeral procession, Alejandro imagines himself lying in the casket with the fireman's corpse, and collapses from fright. Jaime takes him home, but burns the mascot's uniform in front of Alejandro when he wakes up, again calling his son a coward and claiming he is ashamed of him. In an attempt to prove his own bravery to the other firefighters, who he fears look down on him because of his son's cowardice and his Jewish heritage, Jaime attempts to distribute water to plague victims quarantined outside the town, but they kill and eat his donkeys and he himself is infected. He walks back to his shop, visibly infected, and a stand-off with the army ensues. As Jaime goes into convulsions and the army threaten to burn the shop to contain the infection, Sara prays for Jaime's recovery and urinates on him, curing him.Energized by his miraculous recovery, Jaime plans to assassinate the right-wing president Carlos Ibáñez del Campo (Bastian Bodenhofer). He agrees to work with another communist to assassinate Ibáñez at a dog show, but the gun fails and Jaime passes himself off as a hero when he jumps between Ibáñez and the gunman. To get close to Ibáñez, Jaime asks for a job as groom to the president's beloved horse Bucephalus as payment for his heroism. Jaime then poisons Bucephalus as part of his plot to kill Ibáñez, but when Jaime has Ibáñez at gunpoint, his hands become paralyzed.The story returns to Alejandro and Sara, and Sara begins teaching Alejandro how not to be afraid of darkness and how to make sure people don't notice him. She tells him that she knows in her heart that Jaime is alive and loves both of them. They tie a stone to a balloon and release it in the belief it will find its way to him. The rock is then shown falling on the roof of a shack which Jaime is living in. Jaime awakes to discover that he has lost his memory, that he is living with a diminutive peasant woman, and that his arms have been painted the colors of the Chilean flag.Jaime begins a long journey home, but is captured by Nazis and tortured.

You have lived in the guise of a tyrant."" Alejandro, Jaime, and Sara board a ship and leave Tocopilla."

Even his parents believe he is guilty. Only his childhood friend and lawyer Lee Tourneau believes Ig is telling the truth.

Ostracised from the community as an unrepentant killer, Ig wakes up after a long night of binge-drinking to discover that a pair of gnarled and menacing horns have sprouted up in his forehead, possessing a new set of superhuman powers that can bend the free will of everyone around him. Now, unspeakable desires and abysmal secrets come to light, as, more and more, Ig renounces his former self. Can Perrish use his infernal authority to unearth the truth?—Nick Riganas Ignatius Perrish (Daniel Radcliffe) was always seen by the people in town as an outsider. None of that mattered to him, because he was in love with Merrin Williams (Juno Temple). They are lying beneath a tree in the woods kissing. She asks him if he's horny. He says he's getting there. Ig promises to love Merrin for the rest of his life. She just wants him to love her for the rest of hers.Ig wakes up lying on the floor clutching a bottle of vodka. He groggily goes into the living room and puts on a David Bowie record to play ""Heroes"". He sees Merrin dancing for him. Outside his window is a news van and many angry protesters, holding signs that condemn Ig to hell. Merrin has been murdered, and everyone thinks he did it.Ig calls his lawyer friend Lee Torneau (Max Minghella) for help. He then goes to his family's home for sanctuary from the press. Ig's brother Terry (Joe Anderson) wants to help Ig clear his name. Their father Derrick (James Remar) has sought a lawyer for Ig, but all the other lawyers want Ig to take a plea, while Lee knows he is innocent. Lee later comes over to join his friends. He tells Ig that any evidence found on Merrin's remains were burned in a forensics lab, thereby leaving Ig with nothing to prove his innocence. Ig vows to find the real killer and finish him off.Ig goes to a bar where the bartender refuses to serve him because the other patrons are afraid of him. Glenna (Kelli Garner), an old friend of Ig's, takes pity on him and pours him a drink. She offers to go have a drink with him, but he wants to be alone.A large gathering of townspeople come together for a vigil around the tree where Merrin's body was found. Her father Dale (David Morse) tearfully talks about his daughter and also accuses Ig of killing her. Ig watches from a treehouse above them. After everybody leaves, Ig stomps on a statue of the Virgin Mary and then pees all over the candles. Glenna catches him and tells him to calm down. Ig blames God for not caring about Merrin when she needed help.The next morning, Ig awakens after sleeping with Glenna to two horns protruding from his head. He gets dressed and asks Glenna if she notices the horns. She does, but doesn't react beyond a laugh. She sees a box of doughnuts on the coffee table and asks Ig if she can eat all of them. He says yes, and she stuffs one in her mouth. It makes her stomach feel bad, and she washes it down with Diet Coke. Yet she still wants to eat the whole box because, as she casually tells Ig, she wants to get fat because everybody thinks she is trash and that nobody would sleep with her unless they were drunk like Ig was.Ig goes to the doctor to get the horns checked out. A little girl is screaming in the waiting room while her mother sits and does nothing. The mother tells Ig that she wants to kick her daughter's ass, divorce her husband, and go have sex with her black golf instructor because she prefers ""black cock"". A disturbed Ig goes to the receptionist and gives back the form he had to fill out. The receptionist tells Ig that she just wants to tell the mother to shut her kid up. She asks Ig if he thinks it's okay and he says yes. The receptionist gets up and yells at the mother to take her ""screeching pig"" out. The mother angrily yells at the receptionist and goes up to her. Ig grabs her arm and gets a peek inside her mind. He sees the woman having sex with her golf instructor and dealing with the screaming daughter at home. The little girl also tells Ig that she hates her mother and wants to burn her in her bed with matches.Ig sees the nurse. She is checking his blood pressure but is fixated on his horns. She tells him that she knows her boyfriend is seeing another girl. The doctor comes in and sees the horns but doesn't bother dealing with them and instead tells Ig that he wants to have sex with his daughter's friend, and then offers to snort oxycontin with Ig. Ig just tells him to saw the horns off. The doctor puts Ig under anesthesia and he passes out.We see a flashback to when Ig was a child and he first saw Merrin in church. She shined the light reflecting off her cross necklace in Ig's direction. Derrick tells him it's morse code. After the service, he finds Merrin's necklace, broken.Later on, Ig would hang out with Terry, Lee, Glenna, and another kid named Eric by the docks. They lit off cherry bombs and talked about Merrin, to whom Ig is attracted, which upset Glenna because none of the other boys seemed to really notice her. After lighting off a number of cherry bombs, Eric tells Ig he'll give him his last one if he rides down a log rail in a cart naked. Ig takes the challenge and rides off into the lake, hitting his head on a log. The logs come together, trapping him underneath. Lee jumps in and rescues Ig. Eric is forced to hand Ig the cherry bomb.Lee fixes the cross necklace and gives it to Ig in exchange for the cherry bomb. Ig gives it back to Merrin and starts hanging out with her. Ig learns that Merrin's mother passed away from cancer. They go back to his house and listen to David Bowie. Terry runs in and tells Ig that the cherry bomb blew up in Lee's hand. They run to the hospital where the boy has lost two fingers. He does feel happy seeing Ig and Merrin together. Ig later confesses to Merrin that it was Lee who fixed the necklace, and he blames himself for what happened to him. Merrin assures him that she left the necklace for Ig to find. They have their first kiss.Ig wakes up to see that the doctor left the saw in the horn to have sex with the nurse right next to him. Disgusted, Ig leaves, only to see in the mirror that the horns have grown.Ig finds a priest and asks for his help. The priest coldly suggests that he can get a rope and hang Ig, or Ig can do the deed himself. The only person that doesn't notice the horns is Lee. This makes Ig think the horns don't work on good people.Ig goes to his parents' home and hears the truth from both of them - his mother thinks she would be happier if he wasn't her son, and Derrick always thought Ig was a difficult child, and that he hates Ig for supposedly killing Merrin, because she was the only thing that he loved about Ig. He also reveals that he had someone burn the evidence in the forensics lab. Ig calls Lee about this, who says it's probably a blessing in disguise.Ig goes to the bar but is harassed by a gaggle of reporters trying to get a hot scoop from him. Ig tells them to fight each other, and whoever wins gets to interview him. The reporters then get into an intense brawl while Ig walks into the bar. The bartender threatens to hit Ig, but Ig tells him he doesn't want to do that. The bartender admits he wants to burn the bar down and collect the insurance money. Ig demands anybody in the bar to tell him if they know anything about Merrin's murder. The other patrons just admit more sinful things, and one man takes his pants off and whips his penis out. Ig leaves as the bartender lights the place up, and he walks past the reporters, still fighting.As Ig sits in his car to have a smoke, he notices a small box in the glove compartment. In another flashback, we see that Ig was telling Lee and Terry that he was planning to propose to Merrin that night at the diner, and that the guys would join them to celebrate. Ig later goes to the diner to meet with Merrin, who looks melancholic. She tells Ig that she is moving to Los Angeles, which he thinks is a good chance for a fresh start. However, Merrin says they should break up and see other people to know if he really wants to spend the rest of his life with her. He thinks she is already seeing someone else. She starts to leave, and Ig gets up and loudly argues with her until the manager tells him to leave. Ig leaves without a fight, just as Terry starts to come in. The next morning, Eric (Michael Adamthwaite), now a cop, finds Ig sleeping in his car and asks him when he last saw Merrin. The fact that Ig asked if something happened to her only fuels Eric's suspicions.Ig returns to the diner to talk to the waitress, Veronica (Heather Graham), who has been feeding the police false information about Ig on the night Merrin was killed. Veronica told the cops that Ig dragged Merrin into his car and took her into the woods to kill her before having anal sex with her. All of this so that Veronica can be featured on the news as a key witness.Ig goes to the jazz club where Terry plays with his band. Glenna approaches him and admits that she was always in love with Ig, which he did already know. After the performance, Terry meets Ig outside and admits that he was with Merrin after Ig left the diner. Ig attacks his brother and, as he touches him, sees into Terry's mind to that night. Terry drove Merrin away from the diner, but she ran away into the woods in the pouring rain. The next morning, Terry woke up in his car with a bloody rock in his hand. He ran into the woods to find Merrin dead. He wrapped the rock in his shirt and threw it in the lake to avoid being implicated. After this, Eric and his partner come in and cuff Ig. The two cops then make crude jokes about beating Ig while they jerk off.The next day, Ig finds Lee in town wearing Merrin's cross necklace. Lee denies it at first but then says she gave it to him. Ig breaks down, thinking Lee was the one that Merrin was leaving him for.Ig then goes to Dale's home to try and see if he knew if Merrin was seeing anybody or mentioned leaving him, only to have Dale point a shotgun at him, ordering him to get off his property.Ig goes down an alley to forcibly remove the horns, to no avail. A group of snakes slither on over to him, but they do not harm him. They slither onto him, and he is okay with it.Ig walks past Eric and his partner in their car. They threaten to arrest him, but Ig says they would be happier sucking each other off. The two admit they're gay and that they love each other, and they proceed to make out and have sex. Ig then gathers the snakes and finds Veronica in her car. The snakes make their way into the car and bite Veronica all over her face and body, scarring her and ensuring that she can't enjoy a life of fame.Ig, wearing the snake around his neck, goes to find Terry doing a lot of drugs. Ig forces Terry to do an enormous amount to trip out and eventually torture him with the same feelings that Merrin felt the night she died. Terry experiences a horrible trip and collapses.Down by the docks the next day, Ig meets up with Lee. Ig removes the cross necklace from him, and Lee can finally see Ig's horns. And then he admits that it was HE who really killed Merrin. Ig chokes Lee and sees his memories. Previously, Merrin suspected that Ig was going to propose, and she asked Lee if it's true. He said maybe. Merrin recently learned some things about herself and didn't want Ig to be involved with it, so she confided this to Lee. On the night that Ig left the diner, Lee followed Terry and Merrin until they stopped by the woods. Lee found Merrin in there and tried to kiss her, but she pulled back. He thought she left Ig for him, but Merrin says she loves Ig more than anything in the world. Angry, Lee struck Merrin and raped her before cracking her head with a rock. He then planted the bloody rock in Terry's hand and fled the scene. Ig grabs a pitchfork and tells Lee to go turn himself in, but Lee grabs a chain and whips Ig in the back repeatedly. He pushes him in his car and douses it with kerosene, then sets it on fire. Unable to get out, Ig drives the car into the lake. Lee later tells the police that Ig confessed to killing Merrin before killing himself.Ig emerges from the lake, terribly burnt but alive. He returns to Dale's home. Dale now realizes that Ig really didn't kill Merrin. He invites Ig inside and gives him a key that Merrin wanted him to have. Ig hands Dale her necklace, but Dale lets him keep it. Ig puts it around his neck, and then his burns heal and the horns go away.Ig brings the key to the treehouse and opens a box with a note inside from Merrin. It's written in morse code, and it says that Merrin knew she was dying of cancer like her mother, and after seeing how it affected her father, she didn't want Ig to know about it since he would have only wanted to marry her more, and she didn't want him to live with her suffering. She does vow to find him again someday in the same treehouse. Ig cries.Ig visits Terry in the hospital, recovering from his drug episode. Ig is sorry for what he did, and he tells Terry that Lee is the real killer and that he's going after him.Ig goes to Lee's house and asks him to join him for a walk. They go into the woods to the spot where Lee killed Merrin. Eric appears with a shotgun aimed at Lee, followed closely by Terry, who told Eric about Lee. Lee appears to go quietly, but he trips Eric and grabs the shotgun and shoots Terry in the leg. Ig grabs the pitchfork and tries to pull the shotgun out of Lee's hand, only to aim it directly in Eric's face and blow his head off. Ig and Lee struggle, when Ig then takes off the cross necklace. He suddenly grows wings that lift him in the air, and then they catch fire. His whole body is consumed by fire until he morphs into a demonic creature with bigger horns. Lee shoots at Ig, who bleeds lava, but he charges at Lee and impales him with his horn and throws him against a tree. The snakes then come by and wrap themselves around Lee, and one snake slithers through the impalement wound and into Lee's mouth, gagging him to death. Ig, now having avenged Merrin, falls and begins turning to stone. Terry rushes to his brother's side.The film ends with the opening scene of Ig and Merrin under the tree, suggesting they have reunited in death."

Alan Partridge,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469021/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When famous DJ Alan Partridge's radio station is taken over by a new media conglomerate, it sets in motion a chain of events which see Alan having to work with the police to defuse a potentially violent siege. Radio DJ Alan Partridge is facing uncertain times with his radio station being taken over by a corporate conglomerate. He makes things worse when he talks down a colleague after a promise to talk him up. The colleague handles things badly and takes the radio station into his own hands, literally, by taking them all hostage. Envisioning all his action heroes in his head, Alan will save the day by becoming a go-between for Scotland Yard, but his method will put himself and others in harm's way because Alan Partridge just can't keep his mouth shut.—Anne Campbell DJ Alan Partridge's radio station has been taken over by a large media organisation. In an attempt to keep his job, Partridge undermines another DJ, Pat Farrell, who is sacked instead. This has unintended consequences when Farrell pops up at the relaunch party and takes the entire radio station hostage. Partridge becomes the intermediary between the police and Farrell.—grantss A local radio station in Norwich, North Norfolk Digital, has been bought out by a multinational conglomerate and is about to be re-branded as ""Shape"", with staff members facing redundancies. DJ Alan Partridge is unconcerned about the change but fellow DJ Pat Farrell (Colm Meaney) fears for his job, and pleads with Alan to gatecrash a board meeting and persuade the new owners not to get rid of him. When Alan inadvertently discovers it is either Pat or himself that must go, he betrays Pat, writing ""JUST SACK PAT"" on the meeting room flipchart. Pat is later asked to leave.That evening the new owners of the station host a party and while Alan is outside with his assistant Lynn (Felicity Montagu), Pat enters the station with a shotgun and holds the staff hostage. Alan returns to the party and is shot at by Pat. Escaping and commandeering a car he heads to the nearest police station (just over the road) to report events. The police press Alan into service as a negotiator, establish a command centre in a nearby school and send him back into the station to speak to Pat.Alan builds an uneasy rapport with Pat, who explains that he just wants his job back, and together with Alan's co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key) they continue to host an on-off radio show during the siege. Alan hallucinates several times about being a hero and ending the siege, but cannot bring himself to grab Pat's gun. As the siege becomes national news, Lynn is persuaded to ditch her frumpy style for a TV interview and Alan's ego swells due to his pivotal role. He steals a kiss from a co-worker named Angela who caught his eye earlier in the day (Monica Dolan).Alan accidentally locks himself out of the building and loses his trousers whilst trying to get back in through a window. The police realise he is ineffective as a negotiator and instead try to send in an undercover officer disguised as a pizza delivery man, but Alan interrupts and takes the pizzas in himself. Once inside, he discovers a taser in one of the boxes, and an argument erupts between the hostages during which the police burst in. Pat manages to escape with Alan and Alan's faithful Geordie friend Michael (Simon Greenall) in the stations tour bus.
While on the tour bus Pat and Alan continue to host the ongoing radio show, and it seems as if they trust one another again. But when looking at a photo of the radio management, Pat notices Alan's ""JUST SACK PAT"" on the flipchart in the background, and recognising his handwriting deduces Alan was behind his redundancy. Alan hides in the tour bus portaloo and escapes under the bus in the septic tank.The final scene takes place on Cromer Pier where Pat faces off with Alan and the police. Michael tries to distract Pat by throwing himself off the pier (to no effect), and Pat explains he is depressed due to the death of his wife. Unable to shoot himself with the long-barreled shotgun, Pat gives the gun to Alan, who throws the weapon aside and is shot in the leg as it goes off, and also accidentally shot in the shoulder by a police sniper. Lynn arrives thinking Alan is dead but a paramedic assures him he will be fine.The film ends with Alan returning to North Norfolk Digital along with the (somewhat shell-shocked) Sidekick Simon and a weekly call-in from Pat who has now been jailed.

The Boy and the World,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3183630/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A little boy goes on an adventurous quest in search of his father. An amazing Brazilian animation that truly exemplifies the power of imagery and music as a combination that has more than enough to portray a powerful and deep message. It shows an adventurous quest that illustrates the issues of the modern world through the eyes of a child. A cautionary tale of globalization, The Boy And The World teaches above all the dangers of the massification of the economy, of the mind, and of the soul.—Elo Company Cuca's cozy rural life is shattered when his father leaves for the city, prompting him to embark on a quest to reunite his family. The young boy's journey unfolds like a tapestry, the animation taking on greater complexity as his small world expands. Entering civilization, industrial landscapes are inhabited by animal-machines, with barrios of decoupage streets and shop windows, and flashing neon advertisements that illuminate the night. The story depicts a clash between village and city, hand crafted and mechanized, rich and poor - and throughout the tumult, the heart and soul of the people beats on as a song. The film's music is on equal footing with the stunning visuals, a soundscape of pan-flute, samba, and Brazilian hip-hop mixing with the whirling carnival colors and exploding fireworks.—GKIDS The entire film is told with very little dialogue and what dialogue there is, is actually Portuguese, but backwards.
Cuca (Vinicius Garcia) lives a very simple and blissful life with his parents, playing in the forests and interacting with the animals and listening to sounds that are represented by glowing balls of light. One day Cuca's father (Marco Aurélio Campos) leaves by train to find work saddening Cuca with the nostalgia of playing with his mom and dad. Feeling that he will never be happy again, Cuca leaves with a large suitcase that contains only a picture of him and his parents. While waiting for the train, a sudden gust of wind lifts him up carrying him far away to a world that appears to have two moons.Cuca is rescued by an old man (Alê Abreu) and his dog (Cassius Romero), who promptly take him along to work in the cotton fields. While there, Cuca hears the music of a traveling parade lead by a young man (Felipe Zilse) in a rainbow poncho. The foreman of the cotton fields begins going over his workers firing those who are unable to work or are sick which unfortunately includes the old man. Cuca, the old man, and the dog leave and stop under a large pink leaved tree where Cuca spots his father traveling in the back of a truck and leaves the old man and dog to continue his journey.He arrives at a factory where the workers churn the cotton into fabric in robotic unison. At the end of the day, Cuca takes a bus into a grimy city and he ends up staying with a young factory worker who is later revealed to be the rainbow poncho-wearing parader. In the morning, Cuca and the young man arrive at the market where the young man works as a street musician on the side. While playing with a kaleidoscope, Cuca ends up on a barge where he learns that the fabrics are taken to a futuristic Utopian city where they are folded and repackaged to be sold back in the grimy city. He reunites with the young man who takes him back to the factory to reveal where he makes the rainbow poncho. They then witness the factory's manager making a deal with business men to replace the workers with a large automatic machine. The young man and the rest of the workers are fired and it is implied that they will continue to work in the cotton fields.While making their way back to the city, Cuca and the young man are stopped in traffic by the parade. Cuca suddenly spots the train his father came on and, using the young man's bike, arrives at the station to greet his father. However, Cuca is shocked to see multiple fathers who all look the same and all came to the city for a similar purpose. The parade is suddenly stopped by the city's army which is represented by a giant rainbow bird being defeated in combat by a black bird and various army weapons. Cuca later witnesses young children living in the slums preparing to start a rebellion of some kind.In haste, Cuca runs back home where he witnesses various machines taking over everything inter cut with live-action footage. He arrives back at the pink leaved tree where it is revealed that the old man is actually an older Cuca and that the tree is outside his now dilapidated childhood home. In flashback, the young man, who is also Cuca, is seen leaving home and saying goodbye to his mother while seeing a sapling of the tree. Old Cuca pins the photo of him and his family and dons the rainbow poncho where it is shown that his childhood home is surrounded by newer houses and farmers where their children continue to play. The movie ends with one final flashback of Cuca and his parents planting the seed that will become the pink leaved tree."
Europa Report,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2051879/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An international crew of astronauts undertakes a privately funded mission to search for life on Jupiter's fourth largest moon. Europa, Jupiter's moon is known to have potential to support life. Hence a manned mission is sent to Europa to search for data proving existence of life there. ""Europa report"" shows the difficult choices and sacrifices the crew has to make to fulfill their objective of sending valuable data to Earth for research.—Keith Francis The whole movie is made to look like it was made from a collection of recovered video footage. The movie begins with an introductory screen saying, ""The Europa One mission was the first attempt to send men and women into deep space."" Various camera feeds are shown of the ship's interior and exterior. In one video, Engineer James Corrigan (Sharlto Copley) is shown recording a video diary; in others team captain William Xu (Daniel Wu) is seen adjusting various panels, Dr. Katya Petrovna (Karolina Wydra) is seen fixing gear, Andrei Blok (Michael Nyqvist) and Dr. Daniel Luxembourg (Christian Camargo) are seen enjoying a floating game of chess and pilot Rosa Dasque (Anamaria Marinca) is seen adjusting panels and monitors in the cockpit. The camera feeds slowly start to get distorted and eventually stop, with the feed from the cockpit of pilot Rosa Dasque being the last image before a static.Back on what appears to be earth at that present time, Dr. Samantha Unger (Embeth Davidtz) is apparently giving an interview on the Europa One mission, saying, ""These were the last few images from the Europa One craft. At that time it had already traveled further than any human being had ever traveled before. For 16 long months I have been asked the simple but loaded question: What happened?..all...I am sorry.."" She is visually upset while recalling the mission details.It appears that somehow the rest of the mission video footage was later recovered and then compiled to tell the story of the crew aboard Europa One.The footage of Europa One resumes with the team assembled in the central living area, all except James Corrigan. Everyone is upset; it is obvious something bad must have happened. Katya asks about informing 'his' family and whether they should go on. Back on earth Dr. Umber explains she was on board a transatlantic flight when she was informed that feed transmission from Europa One had stopped, and what they expected to be just delayed was already over 15 hours of dead feed.The recorded video diary of pilot Rosa is shown and she confirms the death of James Corrigan, and how badly it affected the whole team, saying how the ""exhilaration of it all left."" The rest of the team appear in various camera feeds visibly stressed and broken down, Andrei seemingly most distraught. Daniel and Katya pack James' bag. A year after James' death the team is still depressed and trying to cope.The mission video feed now goes back 19 months, 10 days and 14 hours to explain the events that lead to the current situation. The viewers are now taken back to the launch day. The administration including Dr. Umber are all excited to introduce the mission and reveal its purpose. The team pull off a successful launch and are up in space on their way to Europa. The 6 man crew, the first to journey beyond the moon, is applauded loudly at mission control. On board James starts his video diary by introducing the ship's interior, their daily life and the rest of the excited crew. Dr. Umber (back on Earth) cuts in saying how far they have come and how far they yet have to go. Several pre-launch interviews are shown explaining that the purpose of the mission is to seek out life in Europa, as it has been confirmed that free water does exist beneath its very thick layer of ice, and even heat signatures have been found in the area called the ""Conamara Chaos."" On board, the team continues with their regular life. Various interviews of the team members back on earth are shown, including more information about the trip prior to the launch. Going forward again to the 19th month of the mission, team captain William Xu and Daniel confront Andrei about his slow recovery and after he leaves rather rudely the two decide that they will be taking him with them in the lander to Europa.21 months, 16 days and 23 hours into the trip Jupiter is very close and pilot Rosa records in her video diary that the closeness of the planet brought back the excitement, and the team is ready to work for the mission again. The crew soon reach Europa and prepare the lander. They reach close to the surface smoothly but face radiation interference close to the landing site and choose an alternate landing zone about 100 meters away from the Conamara Chaos- their preferred site. Back on Earth at that time Dr. Umber still had no idea about what happened to the crew, and stared at Jupiter in the night sky hoping that they made it. Dr. Sokolov (Dan Fogler) informs again that the objective was to do extensive surface tests with a robotic arm to find life that would have been possible had they landed at the preferred site. At 22 months Daniel says it will be difficult to get the samples that they wanted since they did not land where they were supposed to. Dr. Petrovna suggests they should investigate under the ice since there is nothing else they can do. At 22 months, 1 day the whole landing craft shakes violently twice. Andrei is up in the cockpit and after the camera there gets interrupted by radiation, Andrei peeks out his window and then quickly grabs his camera to record something. While the team below is investigating the cause of the frequent ice shifts, Andrei climbs down and says, ""Guys I saw something."" Andrei reports he saw a light about 100 meters out and it was like an LED down with refraction, and it definitely moved. The team investigate feed from various cameras but cannot find anything, although they do notice radiation interference in all of the ships cameras. Daniel believes Andrei might have imagined the light, but Dr. Petrovna says it might also be the first indication of exactly the thing they came here to find. The team still worries about Andrei's condition and Rosa describes the teams emotions as a raw mix of awe, excitement and fear.
At 22 months and 3 days the ice drill finally breaks through to the ocean below. The team is very excited and wants to explore immediately by putting in a submarine probe. They are filled with awe seeing the beauty of the completely untouched environment. Dr. Petrovna the marine biologist is especially overwhelmed. They try to head to the target zone but also notice thermal activities closer than expected. The ocean is a 100km deep. The team is excited to find any signs of life. The thick layer of ice above prevents any radiation from interfering with the data but when even then they get a radiation spike, Dr. Petrovna figures it's coming from below, from much deeper into the target zone. The team prepares to readjust course, but as the radiation spike continues, they see a flicker of light and then something hits the probe lens, smashing it. The team loses control of the probe; the only way to get sufficient samples now is a surface walk 100m to the target zone. The team break into an argument because the radiation from Jupiter makes this very risky and yet this is the only way they can get samples.Going back to 3 days, 8 hours and 38 minutes into the mission, engineer James Corrigan is alive and challenges that no life will be found in Europa. 6 months, 16 days into the mission, James records in his video diary how tough it is getting for him to stay focused. While the team continues with their daily duties, a solar storm hits the spaceship, damaging key components including communications. Their contact with earth is severed. This explains the image of Rosa in the cockpit being the last image received back on earth. What Earth doesn't know until later is that James and Andrei go out in their suits to fix several things across the ship. When they reach the communications panel Andrei tries to pry open a circuit board despite James' unwillingness and tears a whole in his suit's glove. Rapidly losing oxygen, he somehow manages to hold it with the other hand. James pulls him to the airlock to the decompression chamber, but Andrei was losing oxygen rapidly and seconds away from losing consciousness. Just when they are about to enter, James notices hydrazine spread all over his suit from the panel explosion. The chemical is very toxic and will contaminate the ship's environment, so he can't enter. Captain Xu tries to keep calm and asks James to push Andrei in before he dies, and they will come for James later. The veteran Andrei, on the verge of unconsciousness, tells James to get out of the suit and that he can make it into the decompression chamber without the external suit. Andrei won't go in without him. Andrei becomes unconscious due to depleted oxygen and James, after a moment of hesitancy, pushes Andrei in. The two astronauts are no longer tethered together and James in his hurry with Andrei forgot to tie himself to the hull. The ship drifts away and James is left with only minutes of oxygen. Captain Xu says he can no longer be rescued, because by the time they get to him, James will be lost. All he can do say he's sorry. James says it was an accident, and although terrified, he tells them to thank Andrei (still unconscious) for trying to save his life. He remembers his family, tells them goodbye and slowly asphyxiates to death. Andrei regains consciousness in the decompression chamber, and howls in despair on realizing what must have happened.On Europa again, the team debates the possibility of a surface walk. Dr. Katya Petrovna volunteers and is very excited to do it. The 5 member team decides to vote. It's an even split save Rosa; she votes yes and Katya suits up for the walk. Once outside on the surface of Europa Katya can't believe she is there. She is filled with awe. Rosa climbs up to get a direct view of her from the cockpit window. On her video diary Rosa says saying yes seemed to be the right thing to do, and describes Katya's one hour excursion as a seeming eternity. On the surface, Katya sends back data from several samples. All are negative for life, but when she analyses a subsurface specimen, the team detected an unicellular organism. They can't believe it: Europa 1 has detected life outside Earth. William calls her back, but Katya sees a luminescence in a dark area that she thinks might be the one Andrei saw earlier. On her reserve oxygen she goes in to investigate. On reaching the area they again notice radiation spikes. Katya turns off her lights to see if the blue light she is seeing under the ice responds, and the luminescence shifts closer. The radiation interference spikes, and the crew advise her to get back inside. She is too curious, and as the luminescence quickly spreads around her she can't hear anything the team says. In a world of confusion she slips and the team is horrified to see her signals coming from underneath the ice. She is sinking and they can do nothing. On Katya's helmet camera feed, only her face is visible, her eyes wide with horror and a pulsating blue light all around her while she sinks deeper into the ocean. The team only receives static, and then nothing.The death of Katya knocks the wind out of the team. They stipulate that the reaction of the luminescence to Petrovna's light suggests a complex organism, and they have to leave for Earth to let everyone know of the discovery, without further understanding of this organism, lest they all die and the news of their discovery is lost.22 months, 12 days and 6 hours into the mission, the team attempt lift-off from the surface of Europa. Things go wrong from the start; the lander stalls and hurtles back towards the surface. While they are falling Captain William Xu gets out of his seat and tries to release the water shield to slow them down and soften their landing. He is successful and saves the crew, but is killed on impact.After the ship's cameras come back online we see that Rosa, Daniel and Andrei are still alive; Captain Xu's last moment of bravery saved them all. Andrei does a damage assessment and it's not looking good. They are losing both heat and oxygen,and he predicts they will freeze before they asphyxiate. In hopes that the propulsion system is still intact, the team quickly goes into action. Daniel however quickly loses all hope as he realizes the ice under the ship is melting quickly. On her video log Rosa says it quickly became obvious that they had somewhat ironically landed in their original target zone where the ice was much thinner and constantly shifting. Andrei declares that it will take two men to work on the engines outside for two hours to get the engines back. Rosa suits the two guys up and says in her video log ""that was that and that brings us to now...."" It is now revealed to the viewers that the video log Rosa has been seen to be recording the entire time was only started after Andrei and Daniel set out to try and repair the lander's engine. Rosa records this video ""just in case"" they don't make it, hoping someday it is recovered by future explorers. She connects the recorder to the comm panel.Immediately on opening the hatch, Daniel's suit camera catches radiation interference. He tries to descend using the skewed ladder and when he reaches the surface the ice underneath him gives away. Rosa loses contact with him and Andrei reports he was surrounded by blue light and then disappeared under the ice. Daniel is lost. Rosa asks Andrei if there is still hope and Andrei says says yes, but not for them getting off Europa. Andrei says he can fix the communications module by salvaging parts from the life support, so that they will be able to send their data to Earth. Rosa steadies herself to accept that they have to die and proceeds as per Andrei's instructions. Andrei reaches the surface without trouble and starts to transfer parts from the life support system to the communications panel. A blue luminescence appears right behind him underneath the ice. Rosa spots it with the lander cam, but there is severe radiation interference. The light starts to come closer to Andrei but he manages to finish his job. The lander goes mostly dark inside and the comm panel jumps to life. Rosa immediately starts uploading James' and her video diaries, along with all other on deck and external camera data, and data from the sample analysis. The ice underneath Andrei breaks and he falls, reporting in his last moments that the ship is about to sink. Rosa, in the cockpit, keeps the camera pointed behind her as the ship sinks below the ice. As she watches, crouching in the pilot's seat, the ship fills with water. Lights are seen moving under the surface, attached to some sort of tentacle. The last image seen is a that of an enormous octopus-like bioluminescent creature, closing in on the camera.Mission director Dr. Unger explains how she got the final images and how their mission has finally come back to them. She says they witnessed the sacrifices made and the lengths the team went to push the discovery further. Dr. Unger reveals that in the last moments in the lander Rosa decided to open the hatch to let everyone see what might potentially be there. The discovery of the creature was beyond their most farfetched theoretical models and only shows how our universe is far stranger and far more alive than ever imagined.The movie ends with a group picture of the whole team taken near the beginning of the mission, smiling and excited."

Tiger wins fast, but descends in an amoral spiral and the police is on their trail.—KGF Vissers Tiger Chen (Tiger Chen Linhu) is the sole student of his elderly master's Ling Kong Tai Chi style. Whilst Tiger excels in the physical aspects of his training, Master Yang struggles to instill in Tiger the philosophical aspects, and fears for his character. Tiger harbors a determined ambition to prove the martial effectiveness of the style, as he competes in the local Wulin () contest. In between, HKPD officer Sun-Jing Shi (Karen Mok) has been leading an investigation into Security System Alliance (SSA), a private security firm owned by the mysterious Donaka Mark. Suspected of hosting an illegal fighting operation, Sun-Jing turned one of Donaka's fighters into a mole, but he was discovered and personally killed by Donaka. Despite the setbacks, Sun-Jing wants to continue investigating, but without any evidence, Superintendent Wong (Simon Yam) had the case closed. Believing the evidence will eventually come through, Sun-Jing secretly continued investigating Donaka and things would change with Tiger's involvement.Short of a fighter, Donaka searches for his next great fighter and took notice of Tiger during the Wulin Competition. Seeing Tai Chi as something different and noticed the innocence within Tiger's eyes; he sent an invitation to Tiger for a job opportunity at SSA. Tired of his menial courier job, he took a chance and was flown over to Hong Kong for the job interview. However, once he arrived at the interview room, he was attacked and he subdued his opponent; it was a test of his combat ability. Donaka welcomed him and offered him great financial rewards for joining his underground fighting ring; Tiger refused as it would compromise his honor by fighting for money. However, Donaka had other means of persuasion.The following day, investigators had arrived and had the temple declared structurally unsafe; Master Yang was to be evicted and the temple demolished for new real estate development. Unclear of the legal system, Tiger sought help from Qing Sha (Ye Qing), a paralegal friend and love interest to Tiger. With Qing-Sha's help, she found a means to save the temple: historic preservation and government protection. However, even if the law prevails on their side, the temple's dilapidated status required emergency repairs within a month's time and a lot of money; Tiger relented to Donaka's offer and fought to preserve the temple.Tiger excelled in his combat challenges. With every battle, he won large sums of money, but also evolved and enhanced his combat abilities with every match. His path allowed him to repair the Ling Kong Temple, quit his courier job, lavish his parents with presents, quickly rise in the Wulin Competition, and seem to have a budding romantic relationship with Qing Sha. However, with every battle, the challenges became more brutal and darkening Tiger. Master Yang wasn't a fool and noticed a change in his combat abilities and warned him the dangers of not changing his ways. Unfortunately, Tiger didn't see a problem with his situation and continued to enjoy life; little did he realized Donaka had corrupted him.In a recent two against one fight, Tiger won the battle, but developed a ruthless attitude and brought that mentality into the Wulin Competition. Breaking the rules of friendly and honorable competition, he viciously injured his opponent and resulted him disqualified from the competition. Master Yang witnessed what happened on TV and was shocked at Tiger's ruthlessness. When Tiger came to train with Master Yang, it was an aggressive fight than a respectful spar. Despite his advanced age, Master Yang held his own and was forced to use his internal chi energies to palm-strike Tiger, repelling him away. Still loving his student, he continues to tell Tiger to return to the path of peace, but Tiger rejected his master's good intentions and left him saddened. Things worsened when he found out his petition to gain historical protection for his temple was rejected. A disappointed Qing-Sha revealed Tiger's vicious actions from the Wulin Competition swayed her director's decision. Enraged, he demanded the director to explain herself and she reasoned that his actions don't reflect the claimed honor and nobility of his temple's philosophy; she's favoring new real estate development instead.Still raging from what happened, Tiger demanded a fight and Donaka had Tiger face the killer mercenary, Uri Romanov. Using his rage, he quickly defeated Uri and could've killed him, but he refused; Donaka appeared in a black mask to help finish off Uri. Tiger had had enough of underworld combat and wanted to leave, but Donaka laughed at Tiger, thinking he had a choice of leaving. Realizing he's trapped, Tiger decided to reach out to the police. However, unknown to Tiger, Donaka had every aspect of Tiger's life recorded and Gong (Donaka's camera man) reported on Tiger's plan to defect; Donaka had a contingency plan.Now ""secretly"" working with the police, Donaka set up a private tournament for a death match. Sun-Jing secretly trailed Tiger's escort to reach to the secret tournament, but her car was violently knocked over by a truck. Sun-Jing survived her attack and she then contacted her squad for assistance and discovered Superintendent Wong commanded communications to prevent anyone from investigating into particular frequencies that may lead to Donaka; Wong works for Donaka. Several hours before the tournament, a brief video revealed the private life of Tiger, shamefully revealing how exposed his life is and how Donaka manipulated him into underground combat and corrupted him as a person. Enraged, Tiger tried to attack Donaka, but was subdued by a taser. It was then Donaka revealed his vision for Tiger: exposing his life as he slowly corrupted and making Tiger a killer before a live audience.In the death match, Tiger was to face Gilang Sanjaya (Iko Uwais); now fully awakened to his reality, Tiger refused to fight, but challenged Donaka for a match instead. The match was over after HKPD stormed the compound and arrested everyone, including Wong; Donaka escaped capture. Back at home, Tiger was visiting the temple when he found Donaka. They had their own private death match as Donaka demanded Tiger owing him a life and telling Tiger to show him his true nature. Tiger was losing at first, but he re-embraced his Tai Chi training and gained the upper-hand. Donaka forced Tiger's hand as he pulled out a knife and stabbed Tiger in the stomach. It was then that Tiger used his internal powers to repel Donaka. Suffering from internal damage, Donaka was pleased to know Tiger had it in him to be a killer, but died shortly after.Some time later, Tiger repaired his relationship with his master and Sun-Jing has been promoted to Superintendent. Tiger reached out to both Qing Sha's law firm and the real estate developers and all three parties reached a compromised agreement: the temple will be part of a historical cultural village. Not only will the government will protect the village, but now tourists can come and visit, to learn more about the 600 year history of the Ling Kong Temple. Finally putting that chapter of his life away, Tiger tells Qing-Sha that he intends to return to the city and open his own Tai Chi school, to continue on the legacy of the Ling Kong Tai Chi."
The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981107/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A ten-year-old scientist secretly leaves his family's ranch in Montana where he lives with his cowboy father and scientist mother, escapes home, and travels across the country aboard a freight train to receive an award at the Smithsonian Institute. T.S. Spivet lives on a ranch in Montana with his mother who is obsessed with the morphology of beetles, his father (a cowboy born a hundred years too late) and his 14 year-old sister who dreams of becoming Miss America. T.S. is a 10 year-old prodigy with a passion for cartography and scientific inventions. One day, he receives an unexpected call from the Smithsonian museum telling him that he is the winner of the very prestigious Baird prize for his discovery of the perpetual motion machine and that he is invited to a reception in his honor where he is expected to give a speech. Without telling anyone, he sets out on a freight train across the U.S.A. to reach Washington DC. There is also Layton, twin brother of T.S., who died in an accident involving a firearm in the family's barn, which no one ever speaks of. T.S. was with him, measuring the scale of the gunshots for an experiment, and he doesn't understand what happened.—Anonymous T.S. Spivet (Kyle Catlett) is a young boy living on a secluded, rural Montana ranch with his moody older sister (Niamh Wilson), his pretentious entomologist mother (Helena Bonham Carter), and his emotionally distant and quiet wannabe cowboy father (Callum Keith Rennie). Lonely and often ignored and belittled by the people around him - even his own schoolteacher, who envies the boy's talent - T.S. spends most of his time playing, making amateur inventions, and meandering around the ranch with the family dog, Tapioca.T.S. reveals that he had an older brother, Layton (Jakob Davies), who was much more into cowboy stuff, like his father, but not as scientifically-inclined as T.S. was. A tragedy unfolds as T.S. describes how he and his brother were out playing in an old barn on the property, using their father's gun to measure the distance of bullets, when Layton accidentally squeezed the trigger of the gun, shooting himself in the head and being killed instantly. While this event is never shown on-screen, T.S. reveals how much it scarred his family, and worse, that he blames himself for his brother's death.T.S. receives notice from the Smithsonian Institute, all the way across the country in Washington, that he's won the Baird Award for inventing a perpetual motion machine. Of course, Ms. Jibsen (Judy Davis), the museum director, believes that T.S. is a grown man, and that the little boy on the telephone is the son of the prize-winner. Initially reluctant, T.S. decides that the best course of action is to run away from home to receive the prize. Before leaving, he packs a suitcase and takes one last look at Layton's old bedroom, a shrine of dusty toys and furniture that his parents are unable to bring themselves to throw away. T.S. passes his sister and his father upon leaving, who are both too wrapped up in their own daily routines to notice him.That day, T.S. travels initially by train, hitching a ride in one of the rail cars, where he plays and imagines that Layton is still there with him, clear enough for a conversation. After nearly being caught by a guard at the train station, T.S. realizes that he needs to be careful, opting to sleep in an auction show camper that's being transported (there's a life-sized cardboard stencil of a family eating dinner that he can mimic so the average passerby thinks he's just part of the art). He only leaves the camper at night, in search of food, where he meets a hobo going by the moniker ""Two Clouds"" (Dominique Pinon). Two Clouds tells the boy a whimsical story of a sparrow and a pine tree, suggesting that everybody reaches the right destination for themselves eventually. T.S. contemplates using a nearby payphone to call his family, but he can't bring himself to do it.The next day, T.S. walks along the railroad tracks with his backpack (having stored his suitcase in a nearby electrical grid box), when a fat, mean-spirited policeman (Harry Standjofski) begins chasing him and swearing at him. T.S. is forced to climb atop a separating bridge where a boat is passing through. Realizing that maybe he went too far, the policeman panics when T.S. nearly falls to his death, instructing him on how to climb back up to safety, but once T.S. is safe, he goes right back to chasing him again. T.S. eventually loses him, where he hitchhikes with a friendly trucker named Rick (Julian Richings), a man who enjoys meeting people and chronicling this in photography. T.S. realizes, after inquiring about a photo of Rick in military garb pointing a machine gun at an Arab man's head, that Rick was a solder post-9/11. Rick, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, tries to downplay the experience. Allowing T.S. to sleep on the truck, he notices that the boy is injured from nearly falling off the bridge earlier that day, and advises him to see a doctor.After Rick drops him off in Washington, T.S. meets Ms. Jibsen at the Smithsonian. Skeptical that the boy could possibly be the one who invented the motion machine, T.S. proves her wrong by describing his scientific process. T.S. fibs and says he's an orphan, fearing that his parents will show up and be angry at him if they discover where he is. Ms. Jibsen, basking in T.S.'s spotlight, insists on being his new guardian and accompanying him to the conference where he'll be given the Baird Award. She often speaks over him though, much like most of the adults in his life do, which annoys him. He sits at a table alone during the conference, but is suddenly swarmed by a crowd of admirers when it's discovered that he's the boy who made the prizewinning invention.T.S. gives a speech, where he eventually reveals that Layton shot himself in the barn, bringing his audience to tears. He admits, sobbing, that nobody ever even talks about Layton anymore, as if his brother never even existed. Unbeknownst to him, his mother watches from the rafters, having driven to Washington to find him. When T.S. appears on a sensationalist talk show later on, the host, Roy (Rick Mercer), is interrupted by T.S.'s mother, much to Ms. Jibsen's anger when she realizes that she can't be in charge of T.S. anymore. After a tense reunion, T.S. hugs his mother, but as they both leave, Roy and Ms. Jibsen chase after them. Ms. Jibsen, having gotten herself drunk, curses at T.S. and insults him. T.S.'s father appears and punches out Roy for harassing his son, while T.S. mother punches Ms. Jibsen. T.S. apologizes for hurting his father's feelings, but his father smiles at him and gives him a piggyback ride, letting the boy wear his favorite cowboy hat.Back at home, it's revealed through T.S. in an epilogue that his mother just gave birth to a new baby. T.S. puts his skills to the test and invents an even better perpetual motion machine than the last one, and shows how it's used to rock his new infant sibling's cradle on the front porch."
ABCD (Any Body Can Dance),2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321163/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a capable dancer is provoked by the evil design of his employer, naturally he will be out to prove his mettle. For Vishnu (Prabhudheva), widely regarded as India's best dancer, dance is more than a passion - it's the reason he lives! So when he finds himself thrown out from the swish dance academy he himself set up, by his manipulative business partner, it feels like the oxygen has been sucked out from the air he breathes. Heart-broken, Vishnu decides to give up dance and leave Mumbai forever. However the night before his departure he witnesses a most amazing sight - a group of dancers preparing for the upcoming Ganpati Dance Battle - an annual festival that pits Mumbai's best dance groups against each other. Watching the raw talent of these amazing dancers helps Vishnu arrive at a decision - he will take this disparate group under his wing, help them overcome their personal rivalries and past demons and turn them into India's best dance squad! From India's biggest film studio, UTV Motion Pictures, and renowned choreographer & director, Remo D'souza comes India's first dance film in 3D - a spectacular entertainer that proves yet again that if you dare to dream, impossible is nothing!—UTV Motion Pictures After having a bitter disagreement with his friend and manager Jehangir Khan (Kay Kay Menon) about the latter's blatant abuse of power and influence to win a dance competition called ""Dance Dil Se"" for his team JDC (Jehangir Dance Company), the choreographer of the dance company, Vishnu (Prabhu Deva), quits his job. At first he wants to return home to Chennai, but his friend Gopi (Ganesh Acharya) asks him to stay in Mumbai with him. Vishnu observes several young men using parkour to evade the police. They turn out to be proteges of Gopi, but despite their obvious raw talent, they lack the discipline required to become serious artists; they demonstrate this disastrously at a local event for a politician, wherein they set the stage on fire. After witnessing the youngsters showing their dancing abilities at Ganpati Chaturthi against their equally talented rival neighborhood, Vishnu decides to start his own dance group with them ultimately preparing them to compete in ""Dance Dil Se"". However, the lack of discipline among the dancers and rivalry between the two factions in the group led by D (Dharmesh Yelande) and Rocky (Salman Yusuff Khan) leads to multiple creative and emotional blocks. Initially, only Rocky and his gang are willing to attend the free classes, but soon D and his friends gravitate towards the studio.They are soon joined by Chandu (Punit Pathak), a troubled but extraordinarily talented man suffering from a drug addiction, Shaina (Noorin Sha), a ""bar dancer"", and Rhea (Lauren Gottlieb), a Westerner who was JDC's star dancer until Jehangir tried to sexually assault her during a ""private instruction"". Rhea immediately becomes the new star of the company. Though the students are initially skeptical of Shaina because of her profession. Chandu demonstrates a great deal of respect for Shaina and defends her in front of the class despite teasing from his peers. The pair quickly fall for one another, leaving quite a few of the boys heartbroken.Despite repeated pleas for peace in the studio, the two main gangs continue to clash, driving Vishnu to his wit's end. However, the students seem to improve and as a reward, he gives them money to buy new speakers, but they nearly lose it all when Rhea takes them to an elite dance club where they challenge the resident champions, a professional dance crew called ""Fictitious Crew"". Vishnu arrives at the last minute and wins back the money, but while his students gain new respect for him he is furious with them. After some hard apologizing, he forgives them and they return to class with greater discipline and drive, only to suddenly be thrown out on the street after D's father calls the cops. During all of this Rocky and Rhea start to fall for each other whilst D burns with jealousy.The community complains that their children should not be mixing in such a way and only through an impromptu dance performance are the youth able to convince their families of the importance of their talent. Only D's conservative and orthodox father refused to accept that his son desires to be a dancer.The crew head to Dance Dil Se and audition, but when Rocky and D fight onstage for Rhea, their chances of appearing on the show in the first place seems bleak. Jehangir, in a bid to humiliate Vishnu publicly, persuades the judges to take the ""Dhongri Dance Revolution"" crew on as a ""comedy act"". Faced with ridicule and the idea that they are a joke and not true dancers, Vishnu asks Rocky and D to do a step that requires a great deal of trust from both, but they cannot muster the trust to manage it. Vishnu has them choose the people they would trust to perform the step with, but then tricks both dancers by blindfolding them and having them attempt it again; this time, they are successful. Vishnu then states that unless the two manage to do the step without blindfolds none of the dancers would be allowed to go home for the night. Several abortive and unsuccessful attempts later D and Rocky take a break and Chandu talks to D and tells him about Bhavana's secret love for D. Bhavana and D get together, D completes the move successfully with Rocky, and the two factions begin to trust each other and work together.Before the semifinals, Chandu prepares to propose to Shaina, but he meets his old drug dealer on the street. Now completely free from the hold of drugs he refuses to fall back into that world, but the dealer, irritated, tosses the ring intended for Shaina at him and it falls into the street. As he retrieves it, Chandu is hit by a truck and killed, leaving the team devastated. Shaina, though barely able to stand from grief, becomes the centerpiece of the team's semifinal routine, in which they express the loss of their friend, bringing audience members to tears. The team and the community come together to cremate Chandu, and DDR resolves to continue in the competition in Chandu's memory. At the finals, Jehangir pulls a dirty trick: his informant Mayur (a performer in DDR but, tempted by Jehangir's offer of a main lead role in JDC began to feed information to the opposition) leads JDC's dancers to copy DDR's choreography and performance concept. Faced with losing, DDR crafts a new routine on the spot, based around Lord Ganesha. Their heartfelt and spontaneous performance reminds the cold-hearted Jehangir why he and Vishnu started JDC in the first place and he is humbled. The DDR crew are rewarded with thunderous applause and victory in the competition."
Child's Pose,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2187115/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the terrible news of a fatal car accident involving her son, a desperate mother will do anything in her power to set her child free. Seeing a way to reassert control over her adult son's life when he faces manslaughter charges, an affluent Romanian woman sets out on a campaign of emotional and social manipulation to keep him out of prison, navigating the waters of power, corruption and influence. Child's Pose is based on the sense of loss of parents who have to send their children away-physically and psychologically. The parent-child relationship is re-assessed through a son in his 30s that wants to escape from his mother, who in turn wants to keep her adult son by her side. The mother's character is quite familiar, but this film is unique in that the director delicately portrays how the controlling mother wants to deny that her son is destined to leave her by following the characters' emotional flows and gazing at their twisted desires. Luminita Gheorghiu turns in an extraordinary performance in playing a mother struggling to ""save"" her son. Heading to the conclusion, the film shows that the unhealthy mother-son relationship is not that simple when it comes to matters of humane duty.—Ryan Silverman On the night of her birthday celebration, Cornelia, a well-connected and wealthy architect, learns that her beloved son, Barbu, is involved in a deadly car accident. Inevitably, this unfortunate incident will mark the rekindling of an already difficult mother-son relationship, where the shifting of powers between an overprotecting and almost suffocating mother, and a pampered but trapped son who wants to break free, is always in favour of the mother. Now, more than ever--amid facts and their manipulation, reality and the bending of truth--this meddling but caring mother will unleash the unstoppable force of a woman determined to do anything for her child, even if all seems lost. Who can stand in the way of a mother's love?—Nick Riganas"

They fail to realize each other's separate agendas when their plan goes awry in this con movie about honor, revenge and the bonds of brotherhood.—Production Nicky Calhoun is the brain of a gang of thieves, who get caught after a scam, stealing original art from a Polish museum and switching it for a forgery, which mob client Bartowiak discovers just in time. Nicky's elder brother Crunch, with a cleaner record, is sacrificed as he faces far shorter jail term, which he serves wretchedly in Poland. Out, he gains a meager living as motorbike stunt rider in Canada but is relatively happy with juvenile 'apprentice' Francie Tobin and sexy lover Lola. Nicky still pulls off ingenious art robberies, even under the nose of Interpol Agent Bick and his cynical 'paroled consultant' Samuel Winter. Hearing of a copy of the Gutenberg Bible being stolen from an Amsterdam museum, Nicky braves Crunch's lust for vengeance and (re)assembles the crew to deliver it to US client Reverend Herman Headly, whose contraband shipment is stuck at a US-Canadian border station. The plan is for French forger Guy de Cornet to make copies for unsuspecting criminal clients so as to earn enough for all to retire, but Nicky has a further devious plan and isn't alone.—KGF Vissers It begins with a soliloquy by Crunch Calhoun (Kurt Russell) as he begins his seven-year prison sentence, courtesy of his brother, Nicky Calhoun (Matt Dillon). A flashback reveals the heist involving the two men that had gone wrong, resulting in Nicky's capture and subsequent betrayal of Crunch. The heist was that a gangster had stolen a painting & wanted to get it authenticated. Nicky & Church bribed a professor who was going to authenticate the painting & got him to do a 15 minute density scan. In this time, Chruch took the painting out from under the giant machine, took it to a forger, replaced the original with the forgery & puts the forgery back into the density scanner. But, while escaping Nicky triggers the alarms & gets caught by the police. The police offer him a 20 yr sentence or offer to let him walk if he hands over the painting & a fall guy. Nicky implicates Church, who ends up in jail.Once released, Crunch works as a motorcycle stunt performer/daredevil alongside girlfriend Lola (Katheryn Winnick) and an apprentice, Francie (Jay Baruchel). Meanwhile, Nicky steals a painting by Georges Seurat with the help of a partner whom he later double crosses. The partner seeks out and threatens Crunch to get information on Nicky's whereabouts. Shortly afterwards, Crunch informs an old colleague of his, 'Uncle' Paddy, that he's ready to work again. At Paddy's place, he and Francie run into Nicky. Chruch & Nicky have a fight, but agree to work together with Paddy.'Uncle' Paddy explains that a priceless historical book needs to be stolen from a Customs warehouse in Canada and taken to the buyer's middle man in Detroit. The payout is over a million dollars so they agree. Crunch insists on recruiting an old partner, Guy De Cornet (Chris Diamantopoulos), for his skills and talent in forgery. Cornet creates an exact replica of the book which Crunch takes through the Canadian border station hidden inside a peculiar piece of art. An identity check prompts the police to impound his art, as planned, in the same facility where the historical book is being held. Meanwhile, Guy De Cornet passes as an art authentication expert and enters the facility, replacing the real book with the forgery and hiding the real book within Crunch's art piece. After Canadian border patrol clears Crunch's name, he goes to the facility and reclaims his art piece.The team is in the process of taking the book to the buyer when Nicky persuades Crunch to keep the book and forge multiple duplicates to sell to multiple buyers at the same time, netting them several times the original payout. They run into a snag when Cornet reveals that in order for him to create forgeries that would pass such tests as carbon dating and professional scrutiny, they would need 750,000 dollars. Each person names an amount they could chip in and after some persuasion, Crunch agrees to fund the remaining amount. They agree not to contact one another until the required month has passed to conduct the transaction.Sometime during this month, Nicky secretly plots to create his own cheaper forgeries and beat his team at selling them to the same buyers. Nicky calls the original buyer and informs him that there will be a delay, but the buyer claims to know nothing about the deal. A frantic Nicky calls all people and organizations involved in the heist, learning to his dismay that they either could not be reached or had no knowledge of the book.Meanwhile, Crunch explains to his apprentice Francie how the historical book was a fabricated ploy and its true purpose was to steal the Georges Seurat painting from Nicky and make a great deal of money using Nicky's idea of multiple forgeries. Flashbacks reveal Francie was the only who did not know of this plan. Meanwhile Interpol receive an anonymous tip to the whereabouts of Nicky and the painting he stole from the partner he double crossed earlier.The ending reveals the last player in Crunch's plan, an old reformed colleague of his by the name of Samual Winters who had been paired with the Interpol agent who had been watching them at the start of the plan.
Crunch stole the real Seurat painting from Nicky & got Guy to make 10 forgeries of it. He put one forgery in Nicky's suitcase & when Nicky is caught with it, he gets Samual to testify that it is the real Seurat. Meanwhile Paddy has lined up 10 buyers for the Seurat fakes, which allows Crunch & gang to clear 20 MM. Crunch gives the real Seurat to Samual as a gift."

Fellow actor Gauthier Valence (Lambert Wilson), whose career is flying high, is planning a production of Molière's play The Misanthrope and wants to offer Serge the role of Filinte.

John Holmstrom (Josh Zuckerman) and Legs McNeil (Peter Vack) are in their basement talking about starting Punk Magazine.Hightstown, New Jersey. 40 years earlier in 1933.A baby escapes from his crib and runs away. His parents find him three miles away.1972Hilly Krystal (Alan Rickman) stands before a judge. He is divorced with two children and bankrupt again after a second failed attempt to open a nightclub. He walks around New York City with his dog and wanders into a small bar after picking up a junkie named Idaho (Freddy Rodriguez). He asks the bartender if they ever play music there and decides he wants to buy the bar.Hilly goes with Merv Fergueson (Donal Logue), his former partner, to his mother to ask for money to buy the bar, which he does. He calls it Hillys on the Bowery. His teenage daughter Lisa (Ashley Greene) shows up to tell him that she can't afford school anymore and is dropping out. She crashes there while Hilly and Merv work on the bar, building a stage. He wants it to be for country, bluegrass, and blues music. Merv, upset, leaves with Idaho.The name of the bar has now been changed to CBGB. Terry Ork (Johnny Galecki) shows up with his band, wanting to play there. He is the manager of the band Television. He convinces Hilly to let them play there, but only original music, even though they are a raw band. Hilly goes to find a man named Taxi (Richard de Klerk), a man who knows mechanics, to hire him to be a sound engineer. Television starts to play, but Hillys main concern is that they don't play too loud.Hilly goes with his dog to the homeless alley. There's a dead man outside. A police officer named Stan (Michael Massee) arrests Idaho, but leaves the body behind. Hilly goes back to the bar and pays some bikers to get Idaho out of jail.Back at the bar, the band starts to play, but Merv is passed out in the shower upstairs blocking the drain which almost causes an electrical accident. Meanwhile, his mother wants her money back, so they start delivering pianos to raise some, breaking a piano in the process.Thanks to Television, Hilly's bar GBCB's starts to gain publicity and Lisa wants to work there. Suddenly the bar is full and the punk magazine founders are hanging out there, hiring a girl named Mary. The band Talking Heads starts to play there, and Hilly invites Officer Stan to see them play. Suddenly Blondie, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, and a million other bands are playing there. Punk Magazine releases their first issue.The Ramones show up, and they actually aren't very good. Despite the popularity of the club, they don't seem to be making any money because Hilly lets a lot of people in without paying cover charges and gives away a lot of free drinks.The Dead Boys perform there and become very popular. Genya Ravan (Stana Katic) the record producer and other girls start to go wild, and the place is getting insane. Stan shows up to tell Hilly that they've been getting complaints about the type of people the club attracts. He's also three months behind on his rent. He starts to kick out junkies, but the club becomes huge and no one is afraid of having sex or getting high in the bathrooms.The Ramones sign a record deal and suddenly they are everywhere, except CBGB's. Men come to collect the rent, but Hilly had been making deals with the bikers, so they come and beat them up and take them away. Lisa flips out because she didn't realize that her deadbeat father Hilly has not been paying the rent and insists on taking over the books.Hilly goes into the bathroom and leaves the water running while he falls asleep, completely flooding the upstairs, showing his irresponsibility. The bands keep coming, and Punk magazine is interviewing them and writing about sex, violence, and everything. Hilly starts managing the Dead Boys and wants Genya to produce them. While they perform one night, Hilly's mother shows up. Lisa forces Hilly into the office to talk with him and Merv about their finances. He doesn't care though. All he wants at the moment is to talk to Genya about producing the Dead Boys. Lisa goes to smoke a cigarette in the bathroom when she is visited by Idaho who doesn't mind peeing right in front of her. Hilly insists that The Dead Boys are going to be big.Genya goes to talk to Hilly. She doesn't want to produce them, but agrees to anyway. Hilly pulls out tons of money that he has been hoarding away to get them started. She goes ballistic on the band because they have stickers of swastikas on their amp. They're pretty stupid and don't even know what they mean. They go on tour but are a hot mess and crash their bus. Hilly goes to the bank and finds out he only has $300 left in his bank account. He takes it out of the CBGB account and gives it to Genya. Meanwhile, the band gets into a fight, and one of the members, Blitz, almost dies in a knife fight. Hilly tells Genya to make sure Blitz gets the money for his medical expenses and he leaves the Dead Boys to go back to his hometown to his old house. On the phone, Lisa yells at him to get back there because of all the people who are depending on him. Even though he insists hes done, he returns. Lisa tells him she's going to law school, and they all raised money to help pay to keep the club open. Just then, The Police audition. He says ""There is definitely something there"".A text appears that says ""Hilly gave a stage to some 50,000 bands during CBGB's 33 year tenure.""The final scene shows Hilly being interviewed by Punk Magazine. He says he opened CBGB because he thought country music would be the next big thing (and it was) in Nashville.The films closes with a series of texts which say that Blitz survived 17 stab wounds. Hilly managed the Dead Boys for over one year. The band recorded two albums before they imploded.The Ramones played 74 gigs at CBGB's in 1974. The band became so ironic that their music can be heard in TV commercials to this very day and CDs of their albums can be purchased at Starbucks.Debbie Harry was in every issue of Punk magazine. She was GBGB's pin up girl. To this day, her band, Blondie, has sold 40 million records worldwide.Patti Smith was the last artist to perform at GBCB's before its closing with a tribute to Hilly. She is considered the Godmother of Punk.When the Talking Heads were introduced into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, the banks thanked Hilly Kristal.Iggy Pop is widely considered the grand master of punk music. He is still known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics.Hilly's former business partner, Merv Ferguson, was born in England but lived most of his life in New York City. He always wore a construction worker's hard hat and no one ever found out why.Hilly's daughter, Linda Kristal, is currently a practicing attorney living in New York City. She is married with two children.Idaho was one of many street junkies that Hilly employed at CBGB's, usually working in the kitchen as a dishwasher.Taxi went on to sound mix for Bruce Springsteen, Ray Charles and many others. He mixed over 4,300 concerts in his career.In 2012, Yale University acquired John Holmstrom's archives. His art will be housed in the Beinecke Library along with the works of Eugene O'Neill, Mark Twain and Georgia O'Keefe.Legs McNeil became a senior editor at Spin magazine and wrote the book 'Please Kill Me' which is widely considered the preeminent text on the Punk movement.Fact: Jonathan the dog's bowls were considered legendary.The airing of the the Talking Heads induction ceremony in 2002 is shown over the closing credits.Dedicated to the late Hilly Kristal (September 23, 1931 - August 28, 2007)"

Sudden fame and a self-destructive lifestyle were taking a toll on Jack Kerouac's mind and body following the unparalleled success of the groundbreaking novel, On The Road. Once the handsome literary maverick and hero of the Beat Generation, Kerouac now sees only a vestige of his former self, ravaged by alcohol and drugs, aged beyond his years and tormented by self-doubt. Questioning his talent, his faith, and his mortality, Kerouac leaves New York for California, on a quest for redemption at an isolated, fog-banked cabin in the primitive landscape of the Big Sur woods. What ensues in those fateful 3 weeks of August, 1960, is both terrifying and revelatory. While Kerouac is able to find beauty and elation in his surroundings, the dichotomy of his psyche renders him unable to face his demons alone. He sets off on a visceral collision course of paranoia, sex, delirium tremens, misery and madness. His desperation culminates in an intense, hallucinatory breakdown, but the duality of his nature (again) comes into play and he emerges from his dark place - however fleeting - with a modicum of peace and optimism.—Anonymous"

One of the girls hides in a cupboard in an abandoned house and is kidnapped by an unknown person. Dror (Rotem Keinan), a school teacher, is suspected of the crime and is arrested by the police. He is taken to an abandoned building where he is beaten by Micki (Lior Ashkenazi) and his colleagues, to try and elicit a confession. Unbeknownst to the police, a teenager witnesses the whole thing and films it on his mobile phone, which he later uploads to YouTube.An anonymous tip leads the police to a clearing in the woods, where they find a girl's body tied to a chair. She has been sexually assaulted and decapitated. The victim's father, Gidi (Tzahi Grad), arrives at the crime scene and has to be held back by the officers. Micki is taken off the case and it is given to his colleague, Rami (Menashe Noy).When Police Commissioner Tsvika (Dvir Benedek) discovers the YouTube video, he is forced to fire Micki, on the understanding that it's temporary and he is unofficially authorised to investigate Dror. Gidi has plans of his own and follows and photographs Dror wherever he goes. He also buys an abandoned property in a remote and undesirable area of town for the purpose of abducting Dror and torturing him in order to extract a confession. We see him installing a chair equipped with belt ties and various tools that can be used for torture in the dingy basement.Dror takes his dog for a walk in the park.

When it gets too much for Micki and he tries to stop Gidi, Gidi knocks him out, gags him and handcuffs him to a beam to keep him out of the way.The torture doesn't go smoothly, due to several interruptions. Gidi receives a phone call from his mother, who insists she wants to visit, so Gidi feigns illness to deter her. Then the timer for the drugged cake that Gidi intends to feed to Dror goes off, just as he's about to pull out Dror's toenails. Finally, Gidi's father, Yoram (Doval'e Glickman), turns up with soup, made by Gidi's mother, because he's ""ill"". The prisoners are struggling with their bonds and make noise, which Yoram hears. Gidi tries to say it's nothing, but he's forced to go down to the basement and re-bolt Dror's chair to the floor. Yoram has followed Gidi and Gidi explains what he's doing. Yoram is more than happy to help Gidi to torture Dror and discover the location of his dead granddaughter's head.When they are briefly alone, Micki, who finds a rusty nail on the floor, asks Dror to lie about the location of the girl's head to buy them time to escape. Dror is reluctant, but after Yoram burns him with a blow-torch, he gives Gidi a very specific location to find his daughter's head. Gidi then leaves Yoram in charge of the prisoners while he goes to dig for his daughter's head. Yoram's wife calls to remind him to take his medication, so Yoram goes in search of something to eat.

Micki takes this opportunity to free himself from his handcuffs, but he refuses to free Dror.He leaves the house and borrows a phone from a passing Arab and calls the police department, who tell him that his daughter is missing. He decides that Dror must have abducted his daughter before he was kidnapped and runs back to the house.

After a seven month long passion-filled courtship, thirty-something Londoners Natasha Redford and Josh Moss get married despite they being mismatched in personality and temperament, something that their closest friends and family members can see - some who predict the marriage won't last a year - even if Nat and Josh themselves don't see it. Nat, a marketing company manager, is more professional and controlled. Josh, a novelist with a current case of writer's block, is more carefree and childlike. Nine months into their marriage, Nat and Josh have their first session with arguably the most distracted marriage counselor in the city, that session which may be the deciding factor in whether they continue in being husband and wife to each other. Their issues over the preceding nine months are told in flashback, and include little idiosyncrasies which annoy the other, and tensions with each's in-laws, beyond the general differences in their personalities. But what may be the biggest threat to a happily-ever-after for them as a couple may be temptations with others to who, at least on paper, each is more well suited. For Nat, that temptation is client Guy Harrap, an American manufacturer who, unknown to Nat, hired her firm solely in his personal attraction to her. For Josh, that temptation is his old girlfriend Chloe, an aide worker who only recently reentered his life after a four year stint away working in Africa, the two of them in theory never having really broken up in the first place.—Huggo"

She fixates on a tough older guy who will ""sleep with anyone"" and tries to insert herself into his world, putting herself in a dangerously vulnerable situation. Fourteen year old Lila envies the ease with which her best friend Chiara, on the cusp of her sixteenth birthday, deals with boys. Chiara has been sexually active, although she has only gone to third base with her current boyfriend, Patrick. With no experience whatsoever on the sexual front, Lila has no adult guidance with her mother having passed, and she and her father often being at odds with each other. Lila's primary exposure to sex or sexual foreplay is being the third wheel in Chiara and Patrick's outings. In her naivety, Lila believes that what she sees between Chiara and Patrick has the potential to last forever. Regardless of her total inexperience, Lila likes to portray herself as having at least gone to third base, she doing so by mimicking what she hears from Chiara and other sexually active teens. In her own mind, Lila wants to lose her virginity, despite, if she was honest with herself, being more closely emotionally mature to her twelve year old neighbor, Nate, than Chiara, Nate who would most likely be her confidante if she were to tell the truth about the issue of her sexuality. She believes the easiest candidate to be her first is Sammy, an older teen, who purportedly will sleep with anyone. As such, Lila begins to insert herself into Sammy's life, he who would not have even known who she was if she didn't do so.

Beneath the Harvest Sky,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2313896/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A teen drama set during the fall potato harvest in a small northern Maine town. The story of Casper (Emory Cohen) and Dominic (Callan McAuliffe) - two best friends that are fiercely loyal to one another, as they come of age in a small farming town in Maine. During harvest break, Casper is drawn into smuggling drugs across the Canadian border with his outlaw father, Clayton (Aidan Gillen). Meanwhile, Dominic works his final potato harvest, hoping to earn the money he needs to buy a car and take them away towards a better future. But with Casper's life unraveling before their eyes, their friendship and loyalty are put to the test as they are forced to mature and make very adult decisions that will forever alter the course of their lives.—Anonymous Seventeen year olds Casper and Dominic are best friends who grew up together in the US-Canada border town of Van Buren, Maine, where they still live. Irresponsible Casper is belligerent toward authority, he having grown up in a broken home with his mother, Kim, who he doesn't much like, and a houseful of younger half-siblings. He gets along better with his drug dealer father, Clayton, perhaps more out of the economics of the situation, where he sometimes provides his father with prescription drugs for sale, largely stolen from family, friends and acquaintances. Casper is close to being expelled from school. He has also gotten his fifteen year old casual girlfriend Tasha pregnant, she who is pressuring him to step up to the plate and take full responsibility for them. Conversely, Dominic is the model of responsibility, he a good student who the school's guidance counselors expect will go into post-secondary studies. He is a hard worker according to George, on whose farm he has worked for the past two years doing grueling manual labor. People who know Casper and Dominic don't understand why they're friends. For Dominic, it's because when he's with Casper he knows something will always happen as opposed to the boring nothing that generally is the norm in Van Buren. For Casper, it's because Dominic is the only person who truly believes in him. What most know except many that would benefit from such information is that Dominic's sole purpose for working is to earn enough money to buy a car so that he and Casper can move to Boston, just so that they can escape their respective lives and thus problems in Van Buren. Beyond going to see the Red Sox, Dominic has not thought out what his or their life will be in Boston. This vague plan may be affected by what happens in their lives just before Dominic is able to buy the car. For Dominic, he and his most recent girlfriend Emma are trying to figure out the status of their relationship as they will probably diverge following graduation. And for Casper, he is getting sucked into his father's illegal business - most specifically in aspects regarding the smuggling of drugs across the border - without knowing that there are bigger factors in play in what is going on.—Huggo Two teenagers sitting outside. Dominic () says to Casper () ""So, she's not your girlfriend anymore?""The two are then seen in high school shop class making metal dice and joking.Casper's girlfriend Tasha () pulls him aside and asks why he hasn't returned her texts. She says they need to talk. Outside, she tells him she is pregnant. She says she needs him. Long pause. He asks for time to figure it out and tries to reassure her. He says he will call her and leaves.On the same day, both boys are in a classroom. A teacher talks about twins who were separated at birth met up at age 39 and had similar lives.

Casper says he's not going back to school, but that the principal loves Dominic. It's clear this is not the first time Dominic has heard this. Dominic then leaves.Casper is alone and breaks into a house and takes meds from a bathroom.A ragged looking guy ( as Jesse) cautiously approaches a house with a prescription medication drug dealer inside. The dealer has security cameras and sees him. The dealer ( as Clayton) gets a gun. The dealer says through the door ""Badger is down at Tulsa."" The ragged guy says ""Is that you Clayton?"" Dealer says ""Go there Jesse.""At a C-Store called Tulsa, Jesse is in a truck buying drugs from Badger (). Jesse asks why he can't get drugs direct from Clayton. Badger says ""My brother only deals with family.""Casper pulls up on an ATV and goes into the dealer's house. He gives Clayton the drugs he stole.

Casper asks his Mom's boyfriend if he's ever been shot with a potato gun. His Mom is not happy with Casper and says she asked him to not to come by anymore. We now know Casper is 17. He goes into a basement bedroom, which appears to be his, and gets some marijuana.Casper pulls up on the ATV to a remote, rickety, condemned home with no electricity or heat. He changes his shirt from a stack of clothes. It appears he lives there. He then pulls a hidden stash of money and adds to it.Dominic wakes up in his bedroom. A map of how to get to Boston is on the wall. A note on the map says ""You are Here. But not for long."" We now know the setting is in rural Maine, right on the border of Canada.

This is the car he wants. He gets pictures of him and the car together.Back at Casper's abandoned home, he and Dominic smoke some weed and launch a potato through the wall. Just having fun, they push an abandoned car into a gravel pit and launch more potatoes. In an abandoned barn, Casper says that from day one ""they"" decide who makes it and who doesn't. He bemoans that he never gets called into the guidance counselors office. Dominic says they are wrong. It's clear the two are very good friends.A border patrol helicopter flies over. Clayton drives up in a pickup with a diesel tank in the bed. He meets a biker gang member and buys large quantity of drugs.

Like everyone else, she is concerned for Dominic and thinks Casper is a loser.At the abandoned house, they rig a pasta strainer into an antenna and manage to get WIFI.Badger is on a remote road meeting with a DEA agent (). Jesse had worn a wire when he purchased drugs from Badger. It's clear Badger agreed to cooperate with the DEA to avoid prison. And they require Badger to help prosecute his brother. Badger is nervous and contradicted.Badger walks into his apartment and is very edgy. We find out his girlfriend is pregnant and due soon. This explains another reason he wants to avoid prison.Two teenage girls try the old myth of soaking tampons in vodka and inserting them in an to attempt to get drunk.At the gravel pit quarry a large party is raging. Tasha is drunk and Casper is not happy about it. She says he doesn't love her or their baby. She yells she is having Casper's baby.Later that night, Casper, Dominic and Emma are at the party when a pickup drives up and asks if they want to go on a moosafari. Emma does not know what that is. The three get in the back of the truck and end up chasing a moose down a dark, dirt road with spot lights. They are all having fun.Back at the party a band is playing. A drunk guy runs into Dominic and starts to yell at him. Emma instinctively yells for Casper. Casper comes in and beats up the drunk guy. Casper says ""Hitting him is like hitting me."" Casper kicks the guy out of the party. Casper boldly states to everyone that he runs the county.The next morning Dominic is hung-over and his Mom lectures him that he is better than Casper. He has a good job with George the potato farmer and not to blow it. Dominic says they are starting work late that day so let him be.Badger calls Clayton and says he can't make the drug run that day as he's too sick, but we know he's not.Casper and Dominic show up at an elderly couple's house to buy their prescription drugs. Casper says his uncle Badger could not make it. The seniors like Casper and are very friendly to him. The two make other stops to buy drugs from seniors apparently on Medicaid, as they get the drugs very cheap.After a day on the harvest field Dominic and Emma walk along some railroad tracks. They end up kissing.In his garage, Clayton is explaining to his son how big this drug business could be. He shows him how a hidden air compressor valve is what lifts up the tank to access the hidden drugs.Clayton and his son Casper are in the pickup in Canada. Casper says all his friends are working the potato harvest and he's there on a drug pickup. He likes it.Emma explains to Dominic she will be gone the next day to see colleges in Vermont. They have sex in the woods while the night harvest takes place in the distance. She is not experienced with sex.Casper and Tasha are in her bedroom and she wants to know if they can get their own place. It upsets him. He asks her if she means he will pay for it. In the bathroom he sees her used tampon and realizes she is not pregnant.Back at the harvest, Dominic and Emma are in the afterglow. She asks what he is thinking about. He says Casper. They laugh. He shows her pictures of the car he wants. She says she now understands now how much Casper has his back. Dominic says he always thought if he could get this car then they could leave and everything would be OK, although he thought leaving would be easier.Back in Emma's bedroom, Casper gets very upset at Emma for lying about the pregnancy. She says she didn't want him to leave. He says it's over.At Clayton's garage Badger is teaching Casper how to weld. Clayton says he wants Casper to go with Badger as he needs to know the Canada pickup route. Badger says Clayton doesn't trust him and doesn't want to take Casper. Badger walks out.Emma is explaining the college tour she was on the day before. He says he missed her. She says she is falling for him but doesn't want to give him wrong idea. She says they will have to be 'harvest friends.' He's disappointed.Clayton calls his son Casper and asks if he has his passport as he needs him to run an errand.It's night time. Casper and Dominic meet at a diner and Casper gives Dominic a wad of cash and says to stash it as he thinks they will be going to Boston in only a week or so. Casper asks Dominic if he has his passport as he wants to go to a hockey game across the border.We now know Casper was actually sent to follow Badger on the trip to Canada. This was the same trip Badger did not want to take Casper on. While waiting for Badger to leave, Dominic admits to Casper he slept with Emma in a forest, but explains he was not part of her long-term plans.They follow Badger but he never goes across the border. Instead he stops at a strip club parking lot and gets into the passenger side of a car. Casper calls Clayotn and explains the situation. Casper is told to follow the car and not Badger.Dominic gets frustrated and asks what they are doing and he hopes they guy they are following is going to a hockey game. They follow the car to a double-wide trailer but it's dark and they can't see much. They wait.Dominic is flustered at how stupid this is. He asks Casper if he wants to run errands for Clayton for the rest of his life. They argue. Casper states how much money he can make in the business where just a few hours earlier he said they could leave for Boston soon. Casper rhetorically asks what happens after they move to Boston and the Redsox game ends. Dominic explains that Casper is doing everything that everyone has expected of him his whole life. It was he, Dominic, that always believed in him. Dominic explains they were meant to leave. And that life here in this town will get old.At pre-dawn Casper and Dominic see multiple DEA agents walk out of double-wide. That is who Badger met with.Clayton goes to Canada to get the drugs since it was apparent Badger was not. Clayton stashes drugs in the hidden compartment of the pick-up. The biker guy is helping.It's also pre-dawn on the harvest field as harvesters gather. The farmer asks Emma where's Dom. She doesn't respond.The DEA agents all head out together and drive right past Casper's truck. They call Clayton but it goes to voicemail. They realize that Casper's own uncle (Badger) has snitched and things are unraveling.Badger is in the front seat of the DEA agent's car. He begs for another way than telling him where his brother and the drugs are. He says he loves his brother. The DEA agent calmly admits that Badger is screwing Clayton. But Clayton screwed himself.Clayton gets through the border crossing and back into the U.S. But gets pulled over by the local police. Almost immediately, a K9 unit arrives so Clayton knows it's a drug search and they were waiting for him. But when he built the compartment he surrounded the compartment with deisel fuel for exactly this situation.The DEA agent leaves Badger in the back of a police cruiser handcuffed. We are not sure what he told the DEA agent, if anything.The police escort Clayton out of the pickup and search him and his truck. A tow truck arrives. The DEA agent arrives and is told the K9 did not smell anything. Clayton is relieved and asks if they are done. The tow truck driver pulls out an air compressor to lift the secret compartment. The DEA smirks as they find the drugs.Casper and Dominic go by Clayton's house and the DEA agents are everywhere. They realize they need to get their money and leave town immediately. A weather storm is brewing.They arrive at the abandoned house as the wind-storm hits. Dominic runs upstairs to get the money. A huge gust implodes the house with Dominic inside. Casper barely gets out and makes a desperate phone call. We don't know to who.In the distance a group of trucks are driving rapidly down a dirt road. It's the farmer and his crew. They pull Dominic's listless body and set it on a tailgate. No resuscitation is done as it's clear he's gone.The next morning Casper wakes up in his old bedroom at his Mom's house.At the high school, the students are in mourning as the word has spread. Dominic's empty desk is shown.Emma is shown slowly walking alone down the same railroad tracks that she walked before.Casper is now back at the fallen house. He leaves his hoodie on a board as he has nothing else to leave.Clayton is shown in an orange jumpsuit in handcuffs looking very sullen. The DEA agent arrives. No words are spoken. We don't know if Clayton has even been told about Dominic's death yet.Badger is parked on a dirt road near a small lake. Realizing all he's done, he takes his own life with a gun.George the farmer is inspecting potatoes with the same crew that pulled Dominic from the house. We now see the potatoes are bluish and purple inside and out as they are 'Adirondack Blue' variety. They load them on a potato chip semi-truck. The truck leaves. Harvest is over.We see the view from a car driving down a highway. Sun is setting to the right so we know the car is heading south. It's Casper. He has the bag of money they had been saving for Boston.Dominic's Mom is curled up on his bed grieving.As Casper drives, he is overcome with emotion.Dominic's Mom looks at his map that shows the route from Maine to Boston. There is a note on the map ""You are here. But not for long.""Casper driving. Now with a look of determination. We now see Casper is driving the car Dominic had been saving for, for so long.G Todd Williams"

The camera is in the man's eye, which has been installed after a car accident took his sight from that eye. The doctor informs the patient that everything will be recorded and monitored for research purposes. The man, hesitant, asks if there's a way to turn the recording off but the doctor says no. On his way out of the clinic, the man sees a woman who stares at him intently as she passes.After returning home, the patient is playing video games and gets up for tea. He returns to find his game controller far from where he had left it. He hears a crash and finds the tea kettle on the floor.

He flees to the bathroom again and is disturbed by repeated knocking on the door.The patient sleeps in the bathtub overnight. The next morning, everything is back to normal, though his room seems to be in more disarray than the night before. Later, the woman from the hospital visits him. She tells him that her name is Clarissa, and she was the recipient of a cochlear implant, and began to sense things similar to what the patient has been experiencing after the operation. A man appears at the window and the patient tries to alert her to his presence, but she says she knows he's there. He's her uncle who died several years ago. She urges him not to pay any attention to ""them"" and that the more attention they get, the stronger and more dangerous they become.

It is alluded to that the ""father"" or founder of the cult sleeps with the children to ""purify"" them. The interviewer hears a conversation between his fiancée and his best friend, both of whom are crew members, and finds out that she's pregnant with his best friend's baby.Inside, a bell tolls and the father starts talking about how ""it's time."" He gets on an intercom and tells everyone that the time of reckoning has finally come. The camera guy interrupts and the father stabs him in the throat with a box cutter. He continues to talk and the women of the compound pass around pills and liquid.Downstairs, the best friend has wandered into the room he was strictly told not to enter. He finds a surgical room covered in blood and a woman, presumably dead, lying on a bed with her legs apart as if she were giving birth. She wakes up and starts screaming, and he flees. When he returns, he sees that the school of children are now dead and the fiancée is being taken by the women toward the surgical birthing area. The interviewer rushes to help his friends and bursts into a room where men are standing in a circle, holding guns. The men proceed to shoot themselves. Two men enter then, one running as if frightened out of the suicide. Behind them, a man comes and shoots him. The best friend sees the show host being held at gunpoint by one of the cult leaders. The man shoots the host and then shoots himself.The best friend runs after the fiancée but is quickly stopped by an explosion from the room she was taken to. From there, a deformed demon crawls out and disappears. The best friend runs into the father, who is covered in blood. The father concludes a satanic ritual and then blows up. The guy enters the room and finds the fiancée lying on the same bed he'd seen the first woman in. He sees her stomach undulating as if there were something inside. Her stomach stretches until a horn finally rips through her belly. A large horn-headed creature comes out of the woman's stomach and starts howling and slaying everyone it encounters. The shocked friend turns around and desperately runs out of the building. Behind him, he can hear devilish roars and menacing stomping sounds. The friend, the only survivor, sees that the people who killed themselves have now become zombie-like ghouls.He runs toward a car, starts it and tries to escape the compound. As he drives away, thick fog comes from behind his car and the demonic howls get closer. Something then hits the side of his car and rolls it over. Bloody and bruised, but still alive, the man crawls out of the car that's being stomped, but as he gets his head out the car window, he observes the horned beast. The demonic creature grunts the word ""Papa"" to which the man starts laughing hysterically, as he realizes that the beast is his ""child"".Slumber Party Alien AbductionThe segment begins with a group of boys who are making home videos with a camera attached to their pet dog. Throughout the segment, the resident family is shown to live on an open property with a barn, all of which is close to a large lake.

Later that night, the boys once again plan to disrupt the sister and her boyfriend who are now alone in the sister's room. The boys barge in with loud music and strobe lights, thus angering the couple again. During this scene a loud train-like horn is heard as the power in the house fluctuates but the occurrence is ignored.The boys are shown running away from the house toward the lake as they film the angered boyfriend and sister chasing after them. While hidden, the boys notice circular flashing lights down by the dock. The lights disappear and the boys are caught by the boyfriend and the sister who now retrieve the camera. The next scene shows the sister and the boyfriend in possession of the camera. The couple notices that the boys are sleeping downstairs and there is a pornographic film being played on the television. The couple attach the camera to the family dog, which wanders over to one of the boys who is still awake and masturbating to the film being played. The boy is interrupted and the couple enters, laughing at the situation that has now been filmed.The scene is quickly interrupted by a bright flash of light coming from outside and a loud horn blasting throughout the house. Frightened, the group of friends and the couple notice the silhouettes of slender, long-armed, humanoid figures right outside the glass doors that quickly disappear when the bright light dims. The boyfriend returns with a shotgun after momentarily leaving the room. He is shown leaving the room to encounter whatever the group saw outside the doors, but is seen being tackled by a dark figure. The sister is next shown following the boyfriend with a strobe light, and the group is quickly attacked by what are now seen as ""greys.""Gary and the dog with the camera are then trapped in a sleeping bag and seem to be dragged from one of the greys. Gary and the dog are dragged to the lake but are finally rescued by the group who seemed to lose the greys. Gary is unconscious and the group attempts to perform CPR on him when they get him out of the water and on to the dock. While the group attempts to revive Gary, the strobe light shows the greys climbing out of the water and slowly crawling toward the group on the dock. The loud horn resonates through the area once again, which seems to revive Gary from his short spell of unconsciousness.The remaining group run off into the woods in an attempt to once again lose the greys. Hiding among the trees the camera shows the greys and what appears to be a spotlight from their craft searching through the woods, but the group is discovered when the dog barks at the approaching greys. The group once again runs off through the woods and notice what seems to be police lights and sirens. The group runs toward a clearing where they think the police have arrived but are once again interrupted by a flash of light and the loud horn noise. The police are not there and the lights and noises were, in fact, coming from the greys' craft. Realizing this, the distraught group is then picked off by the approaching greys. The last ones, the sister and Gary, along with the dog, run toward the family barn.The sister locks the barn door but the greys enter through the back. The sister directs Gary to climb up a ladder into a loft with the dog. The sister is seen being attacked and taken by two greys before she can climb up the ladder with Gary. A grey is then shown climbing up the ladder in an attempt to seize Gary. The greys are shown breaking into the dark loft and loud jet-like noises coming from what appears to be the greys' craft are heard. The roof of the barn is ripped off and Gary, still holding the dog, is seen being lifted into the air. Gary's grip on the dog breaks and Gary disappears into the sky while the dog plummets toward the ground. The camera falls off the dog's neck and shows him shaking, covered in blood, and severely injured. As the dog stops breathing, the video ends.Source - Wikipedia"

As the darkness of Gabi's past increasingly envelops him, Charlie resolves to win her heart, or die trying. From Wikipedia:Charlie Countryman, a man living in Chicago, is distraught after the death of his mother Kate. At the hospital, he sees her as a spirit and asks her what he should do with his life. She replies by telling him to go to Bucharest because she believes it seems right to do. On the flight, he meets Victor, an elderly man sitting next to him, who is returning home to Bucharest after seeing a Cubbies game, with a silly hat as a gift for his daughter. Partway through the plane ride, Victor dies, and Charlie sees him too as a spirit, who asks him to deliver his gift to his daughter, which he promises to do.Arriving at the airport, he is hassled over the hat by the authorities, but eventually meets Victor's daughter, Gabi, whom he falls instantly in love with. After he gives her Victor's gift, they part. While in a taxi, he finds Gabi in her car on the side of the road. She tells him she can't keep up with the ambulance containing her father's body, and he offers to help catch up to them. While engrossed in playful banter they collide with the speeding ambulance truck, crashing and flipping over, with Victor's body flying out of it. Gabi and Victor's body is taken to the hospital by another ambulance, leaving her car with Charlie. Gabi's car does not start immediately and Charlie is unable to follow the ambulance. After neighborhood kids help jump start the car Charlie decides to take the car to Bucharest opera house where Gabi performs as a cellist. In the car Charlie finds a revolver in Gabi's purse, inscribed 'For my darling Gabi, Love forever Nigel'. Gabi soon calls her cell phone and instructs Charlie to look for a man name Bela. Bela puts Charlie in an empty opera box. Charlie falls asleep and wakes up to a opera performance. He also sees Gabi emotionally playing her cello in orchestra pit. Following the performance, Gabi is confronted by her estranged and unstable husband, Nigel. Gabi suddenly spots Charlie walking by, and Nigel notices and questions him aggressively. Gabi lies that Charlie is a gay tuba player, after which Nigel leaves.Charlie arrives at a hostel and meets his roommates, Karl and Luc. After partying for a while, Charlie enters the bathroom and encounters Nigel, who was waiting inside to apologize for his earlier behavior and mildly threatens Charlie. After departing, Charlie then sees Gabi leaving the hostel after dropping off his belongings left in her car. They spend the night out, sharing fond memories of each others parents. Later, they part ways with Gabi telling him that if he finds her the next day, she will kiss him. Exhilarated, Charlie begins running down the street when he is suddenly hit by a cab. The cab driver takes him to the hospital. Hours later, back at the hostel, Charlie wakes up to find out that Karl has taken too much Viagra, and they go to a club seeking to ease Karl's discomfort. This results in Karl having a sexual climax in front of the strippers, who then call the bouncers to have them taken to the manager's office. The trio are shocked to find their bill is deliberately overcharged due to Karl's incident, as explained by the manager, Darko. Darko notices that Charlie is staring nervously at a picture of Nigel and Gabi on the wall. Darko aggressively questions Charlie about Nigel. Charlie bargains with Darko, in exchange for providing information on Nigel they wouldn't have to pay the bill. Darko gives Charlie his phone number and they leave. Realizing that it's morning Charlie goes to the Bucharest opera house in the hopes of seeing Gabi.Later on that evening Bela notices Charlie sleeping on the opera house steps and wakes him up. After being begged, Bela reluctantly takes Charlie to Gabi's house, were a memorial party is being held for Victor. Gabi takes Charlie to the attic to kiss him. Charlie tells Gabi about his encounter with Darko. Later on, Nigel unexpectedly shows up. He spots Charlie and while holding a broken glass to his neck, aggressively confronts him on not being a gay tuba player and being attracted to Gabi all along. Gabi forces Nigel to leave by firing a warning shot at him. After the party, Gabi tells Charlie how she met Nigel. Although Gabi loved Nigel it was a mistake marrying him. Gabi realized too late that Nigel was an active criminal. At some point Victor found an incriminating tape to use against Nigel to force him to leave the country. It worked until Victor's death; now Nigel wants the tape. Charlie then confesses that he is in love with Gabi, they make love.The next morning, Charlie finds Gabi gone and a note telling him to not leave the house. Charlie explores the house and discovers a room filled with tapes, specifically one that's labeled ""Cubbies"". The tape turns out to be the blackmail footage Victor found. It shows Nigel and Darko killing a group of people at a restaurant. A disturbed Charlie leaves the house and finds Gabi and Nigel at a nearby restaurant. He approaches them and explains that he ""saw the tape."" Nigel violently interrogates Charlie until the police arrive and take Charlie away. At the station Bela bribes the police to not press charges but instead take Charlie to Budapest. Upon arrival at the hostel to get his belongings, he is alerted by the presence of Nigel's associates. They chase Charlie to a subway, where he escapes and runs back to Gabi's home to find the tape missing. He finds Darko and his men waiting for him, showing Karl and Luc's backs glued together outside. Gabi calls Darko regarding the tape, prompting Darko to leave the house.Charlie waits for Gabi at the Opera House, where she tells him that she doesn't want to see him again and says goodbye. She goes to her car with Nigel, who has the tape and intends to destroy it so that life with Gabi can continue. A saddened Charlie once again speaks to the ghost of his mother, who says that she is proud of him and hopes he doesn't die. After she disappears, he runs to Gabi's car and attempts to stop Nigel, only to be knocked unconscious. He wakes, hanging from a rope by his ankle above a boat dock. Nigel burns the tape and prepares to shoot Charlie, but decides to let Gabi do it. She ends up sparing Charlie just as the cops arrive.

In the near future or an alternate reality, there are memory detectives, people who have the ability to enter other people's electronically-aided memories.

By law, Aila is supposed to be attending residential school--an oppressive, abusive environment toward all Indians--but she has been able to avoid this by regularly paying off Popper the truant officer, who calls these payments ""truancy tax.""

Despite Popper now having all her money, she knows her life is threatened if she cannot come up with her regular payments to him, so she decides that the best move is to steal the money back from him--being caught by him would lead to negative repercussions more serious than nonpayment. Her plans are affected by the return of her father, who has just been released from jail and has his own long, antagonistic history with Popper.—Huggo"

Odd Thomas,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1767354/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a California desert town, a short-order cook with clairvoyant abilities encounters a mysterious man with a link to dark, threatening forces. Small-town fry cook Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is an ordinary guy with a paranormal secret: he sees dead people, everywhere. When a creepy stranger shows-up with an entourage of ghostly bodachs - predators who feed on pain and portend mass destruction - Odd knows that his town is in serious trouble. Teaming up with his sweetheart Stormy (Addison Timlin) and the local sheriff (Willem Dafoe), Odd plunges into an epic battle of good vs evil to try to stop a disaster of apocalyptic proportions. Based on the best-selling thriller by Dean Koontz.—PR In Pico Mundo, a small town near the desert, fast-food cook Odd Thomas has the ability to see and talk to dead people. He is in love with his girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn and they believe that they are destined to be together forever. Odd Thomas uses his abilities to help Chief of Police Wyatt Porter solve murders, but when Odd sees the creepy Fungus Bob Robertson, he is sure that the town is in danger and threatened by the possibility of massive destruction. His further investigation with Stormy discloses that Fungus Bob worships the Prince of Darkness and is plotting to kill many people in Pico Mundo. Will Odd Thomas and Stormy succeed in avoiding the bloodshed?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Odd Thomas has a special gift: he can see dead people. Through interacting with dead people he can solve crimes and track down murderers. As part of this gift he can sense impending death through seeing bodachs - invisible creatures that appear when death is imminent. One day bodachs start appearing in massive, vastly-more-than-ever-seen hordes, implying large-scale fatalities. Odd Thomas needs to find out when and where the mass killing will occur before it happens.—grantss Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is a young man who lives in a small town in southern California called Pico Mundo. His morning of August 14 begins with him coming out of his apartment, and meeting the ghost of a teenage girl named Penny Kallisto (Ashley Sommers), who silently leads him to a street, where Harlo Landerson (Matthew Daniel Page) rolls his SS Chevelle convertible beside Odd and says 'hello'. Odd immediately pulls the keys out of the ignition and accuses Harlo of raping and murdering Penny, noting two pieces of white felt from the victim that Harlo apparently has in his pocket. Harlo flees on foot and Odd gives chase, with the chase culminating inside a child's room in a stranger's house. Harlo and Odd have a fistfight and Odd knocks Harlo unconscious. Odd waits on the scene as the police arrive and arrest Harlo for Penny's murder. Odd then meets with his friend, police chief Wyatt Porter (William Dafoe), who knows somewhat of Odd's psychic gifts of seeing the dead and promises to spin the story to keep public attention away from Odd, as Odd does not want that attention. In his voice-over narration, he says, ""I see dead people, but then, by God, I do something about it"". All of the ghosts that Odd interacts with never speak, but they need his help because they are restless spirits who have died traumatically and violently before their time and need his help to help settle unresolved issues before most of them leave this plane of existence for the afterlife.After the police leave the scene, Penny's ghost sits beside Odd, smiles, walks away into a mist into the afterlife and disappears. In further voice-over, Odd explains that his mother also had the ""gift"" of seeing the dead, but her visions made her more hysterical as she tried to confide in her husband, Odd's father, about seeing ghosts which resulted in her being committed to a mental hospital for the rest of her life. From then on, Odd struggles to keep his gift about seeing the dead a secret from nearly everyone.On his way home, Odd encounters a group of faceless people wearing red and black bowling shirts who cry out to him to save them. As the vision progresses, a faceless gunman shoots them all, including Odd. He wakes up disturbed and heads to his job as a short-order cook, where he ends up serving lunch to a strange man (Shuler Hensley) with a haircut that resembles some kind of mold. But more disturbing is his entourage of dozens of bodachs, a horde of invisible (except to Odd) creatures that feed on evil and carnage.After his shift, Odd speaks to Viola Peabody (Guga Mbatha-Raw), who works at the diner with him. She recounts a strange dream in which she saw herself shot dead with another man. Odd asks what the man was wearing, and Viola describes the red and black bowling shirts from Odd's vision. Odd uses his psychic magnetism to find the disturbing man from the diner, leading him to the mall where Stormy works at an ice cream shop. He then borrows Stormy's scooter to follow Fungus Man home, breaking into the house after he leaves. Odd finds an ashtray with several brands of cigarette butts in it, revealing that Fungus Man has friends. He also learns that the man's real name is Bob Robertson, leading to his and Stormy's referring to him as ""Fungus Bob.""Odd finds files containing clippings about various mass murderers, arranged by name. In Robertson's file, he only finds a blank calendar page for August 15, leading Odd to realize that something bad will happen within the next day. One of Bob's friends returns to the house, scaring Odd off, though Odd does not get a look at him.Odd reports on Robertson to Chief Wyatt Porter, who asks his new deputies, Varner and Eckles, to put a watch on Fungus Bob. Odd then meets Stormy for dinner in the belfry of St. Barthlomew's Church, but when Odd sees Fungus Bob approaching, they flee to the sacristy and subsequently escape the church only to hear Robertson destroying the sacristy. Stormy calls Chief Porter, who finds the church trashed but with no physical evidence to link it to Robertson.Psychic magnetism then leads Odd and Stormy to Green Moon Bowling, where Odd realizes that the black and red uniforms originate there. Chief Porter sends Officer Simon Varner (Nico Tortorella) to keep an eye on the place on Odd's advice. Varner asks Odd about Bob Robertson and is surprised to learn that Odd had encountered him only a few hours ago. As he presses Odd for more information, Stormy intervenes and asks Varner about his tattoo, which reads ""POD."" He explains that it is a remnant of a former wasted youth and represents a crude obscenity he won't repeat.Odd and Stormy then visit Viola to get more details on her dream. She describes the events in vague detail, including descriptions of crowd noise, old-fashioned music, and rushing water. Viola then realizes that she and the man in the red and black shirts were not the only victims of the shooting, but rather a large group of people. Odd goes to check on Vi's daughters and discovers bodachs hovering over them. He instructs Viola to leave town, telling no one of her itinerary.Driving home, Stormy is overcome with fear for Odd's safety. He pulls over to comfort her, only to hear a woman screaming. He runs to her aid, only to find that she's been mauled to death by dogs he had seen earlier at Robertson's home. At the scene, a man had apparently tried to rescue her by shooting the dogs, but was too late to save her. The dead woman is Lysette, who was being fixed up with officer Eckles by Chief Porter and his wife Karla.Odd and Stormy return to her apartment and Odd notices a van watching the building. Realizing that Stormy will be safe, Odd sneaks out and returns to his apartment only to find a gun on his floor and the dead body (gunshot to the chest) of Fungus Bob in his bathtub. He realizes someone is attempting to frame him for murder, and that if he reports anything to the police, Chief Porter would be forced to arrest him, preventing him from intervening in the next day's disaster. Odd notices that Fungus Bob is cold and stiff, indicating he's been dead for quite some time and deduces that the encounter at the church was with the dead man's restless spirit.Wrapping the body in sheets, Odd then takes the dead man to an abandoned restaurant/prison/church and leaves him in the empty gas chamber. As he drives back through town, he notices hundreds of bodachs swarming, indicating the scale of the coming events.Meanwhile, Chief Porter is shot in the chest at his home. Odd rushes to the hospital, where he discovers that a gift he had given the Chief, a steel medallion made by Ozzie (Patton Oswalt), has saved his life, though his condition is still serious. Odd attempts to persuade Stormy to not go to work, but she insists on going. Odd then returns to Fungus Bob's home and finds evidence for the purchase of a moving van and improvised explosives, as well as websites for Satanism. He also encounters the angry lingering spirit of Robertson, who goes into poltergeist mode, destroying the house as Odd escapes.Fearing he's missed an important detail, Odd is drawn to investigate the bullet wound in Fungus Bob's chest, where he finds a tattoo reading ""POD."" He makes the connection to Officer Varner and realizes that POD are the initials for ""Prince of Darkness."" Odd realizes that his discovery of Robertson had led to his co-conspirators eliminating him.Odd's psychic magnetism then draws him to the loading dock at the mall, where he grabs a baseball bat just in time to disable Eckles with a blow to the face, though only after he had killed the members of mall security. Odd notices that Eckles has his police uniform on under his tactical gear, showing how he had planned to escape.Odd takes Eckles's pistol and seeks out Varner, only to hear screams from the end of the mall where Stormy works. He hurries to confront the gunman and is able to kill him with the pistol. He fears for Stormy's safety but sees her emerge from behind the counter at the ice cream shop, only to then realize the trouble isn't over when the lingering spirit of Lysette appears and directs him back to the loading dock. Odd removes the gunman's mask and recognizes the man as the one who had killed the dogs earlier and who had initially frightened him off from Robertson's house.Realizing Varner is still on the loose, Odd rushes to the loading dock where he discovers a moving van packed with explosives. The plan had been to herd people to that end of the mall and then detonate the explosives, killing hundreds.As he investigates the bombs, Odd is shot by Officer Varner but manages to start the van and drive it away from the mall. Varner clings to the outside of the van and attempts to kill Odd, who jumps from the van in time for it to crash into a drainage ditch and detonate spectacularly.Odd wakes in the hospital to find Stormy attending him. Viola and Karla come in to greet him and inform him that Chief Porter has pulled through. Odd is a local hero and retreats to Stormy's apartment, apparently enjoying spending uninterrupted time with her for an extended period. Chief Porter, his wife, and Viola finally come and snap him out of his delusion, whereupon he learns that Stormy is in fact dead and he has been spending time with her lingering spirit. He breaks down, and Porter, realizing that Stormy is staying in this world only for Odd, admonishes him to let her go. Odd bids her a tearful farewell, promising her that they'll be reunited one day.In the final scene, Odd then sets off for Las Vegas, where he realizes he has a lot of work to do before he can be worthy of going on to the next life with Stormy."

Based on actual events. Alaska Trooper Jack Halcombe believes Robert Hansen is a serial killer who abducts young girls, tortures and sexually assaults them, then kills them. However, he doesn't have enough evidence to get a search warrant for Hansen's premises. he knows that one victim, Cindy Paulsen, somehow survived, so he decides to seek her help, but he finds that she's now a junkie with trust issues. Holcombe has to earn her trust; meanwhile, Hansen is still hunting and killing girls.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In 1983 Anchorage, Alaska, young prostitute Cindy Paulsen is found cuffed in her apartment. She claims that she has been raped and threatened by Robert ""Bob"" Hansen, an apparently-respectable man with a wife and children. The police officers don't believe her, Hansen isn't charged, and Cindy returns to the streets. Meanwhile, Sergeant Jack Halcombe is assigned to investigate the murder of seven young women, and the detective that found Cindy secretly sends her case to him. Jack believes that Bob Hansen is the serial killer, but lacks the evidences to arrest him. Jack tries to earn Cindy's trust so that Hansen can be charged, but she is afraid and tries to leave Alaska.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil For more than a decade, an elusive sexual predator and utterly sadistic serial killer has been preying on innocent young women in snow-capped Alaska. Now, in cold, early-1980s Anchorage, inquisitive state trooper Jack Halcombe is burdened with piecing together a seemingly endless string of violent and meticulously premeditated murders, as he follows specks of circumstantial evidence. Unfortunately, the only survivor who miraculously escaped the nightmare--runaway teenage streetwalker Cindy Paulson--is reluctant to both ask for help and aid the investigation. Meanwhile, a soft-spoken member of the community and respectable family man finds himself entangled with the mysterious case. Will Halcombe ever unearth the secrets of the frozen ground?—Nick Riganas The film opens in an Anchorage motel room in 1983, where 17-year-old Cindy Paulson is handcuffed and screaming for help. She is rescued by an Anchorage Police Department patrol officer. He takes Paulson to the hospital, and her clothes are kept for a rape kit. At an APD station, she explains to detectives that she was abducted and repeatedly raped. Because she is a prostitute and lying about her age, the detectives don't believe her story, refusing to even look into the man she named as her abductor, Robert Hansen. They claim Hansen is an upstanding member of society, a family man who owns his own restaurant, and has alibis from three people.The APD patrol officer who rescued Paulson is outraged that the detectives refuse to pursue Hansen. He surreptitiously photocopies information about the case and sends it to the Alaska State Police. Meanwhile, state trooper Jack Halcombe has been called to investigate a female body that was found in the bush, half eaten by bears. The police connect the case to other missing girls, who have disappeared after going to what they thought were legitimate photo shoots. With secret information from the APD officer, Halcombe connects the other cases to Paulson's and starts to put together a portrait of Hansen. Paulson details how Hansen kept her captive, and that she escaped from his car when he tried to transfer her to his bush plane.Meanwhile in Anchorage, Debbie Peters gets picked up by a man in an RV for a photo shoot. Later, Hansen eats a quiet dinner at home. His wife and children are away, and Hansen relaxes in his trophy room, casually ignoring Debbie who is chained to a post. She has urinated on the floor, and as she cleans up the mess with a towel, Hansen's neighbor enters the house to deliver a plate of food. Hansen warns Debbie not to scream and leaves the trophy room to greet his neighbor. Hansen then takes Debbie to the airport, where he orders her into his plane. After landing in a remote spot in the bush, Hansen frees Debbie, letting her run in a panic through the woods before he shoots her with a .223 caliber rifle. He steals her necklace before finishing her off with a handgun.Halcombe has a very difficult time assembling a case against Hansen. Because the evidence is circumstantial and Paulson is afraid to testify, the District attorney refuses to issue a search warrant. Paulson keeps falling back into the world of stripping and prostitution, despite Halcombe's efforts to keep her safe. At a strip club, while she is trying to sell lap dances, she notices Hansen trolling for a new victim. Their eyes meet, a chase ensues, and Paulson barely escapes. The encounter makes Hansen nervous, and he hires Carl Galenski to find and kill Paulson. Carl approaches Paulson's erstwhile pimp Clate Johnson (50 Cent) and offers to forgive his sizable debt if Clate turns Paulson over to him.Halcombe stakes out Hansen's house, causing Hansen to panic. Hansen gathers the evidence of his crimes, including the keepsakes from his victims, and flees with his son to the airport. He flies his plane to the bush and hides his keepsakes. Feeling that the chance to catch Hansen is slipping away, and with the victim count now at 17 girls, Halcombe forces the DA to issue a warrant. The search of Hansen's house yields no evidence, not even in his trophy room. Hansen agrees to be interrogated without a lawyer, but he is not yielding any new evidence. Halcombe arrests Hansen, but unless the police find new evidence, they will be unable to hold him.Halcombe orders a second search of Hansen's house, which turns up a hidden cache of guns, including the .223 caliber rifle used in many of the murders. Under police watch at a safe location, Paulson slips away and returns to her life of prostitution. Clate picks her up and delivers her to Carl. When Clate attempts to rob Carl, Paulson uses the opportunity to escape, with Carl in pursuit. After making a call to Halcombe, Paulson is almost killed by Carl, but Halcombe rescues her just in time.Halcombe uses a bracelet identical to one worn by one of the victims in order to trick Hansen into thinking the police have found where he hid the evidence in the bush. The bracelet, combined with the sight of Paulson in the interrogation room, enrages Hansen to the point that he incriminates himself. The epilogue states that Hansen confessed to the murder of 17 women and the kidnap and rape of another 30. He was charged with the abduction and rape of Cindy Paulson and the murders of Joananna Messina, Sherry Morrow, Paula Goulding and ""Eklutna Annie."" He was sentenced to 461 years plus life without parole. Robert Hansen died in 2014 at the age of 75. Only 11 of his victims bodies were recovered. Jack Halcombe remained with the Alaska State Trooper and was promoted. He is now retired. Cindy Paulson now lives in the lower 48 and married with 3 children.The film ends with a dedication and actual pictures of Hansen's victims."
Devil's Pass,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1905040/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of students go to the location of the infamous Dyatlov pass incident to make a documentary, but things take a turn for the worse as the secret of what happened there is revealed. The Dyatlov Pass follows a group of American students on a trek to investigate the true life mystery of nine Russian skiers who befell unexplained deaths while skiing in the Russian mountains in 1959. To this day, their deaths have been one of the most bizarre unsolved mysteries of the 20th century.—ahmetkozan In the University of Oregon, the student Holly King is awarded with her research about the fate of nine Russian hikers known as The Dyatlov Pass Incident that mysteriously died in the Ural Mountains in Russia in 1959. She decides to make a movie following the steps of Dyatlov and his team and she invites the filmmaker Jenson Day; the audio technician Denise Evers; and the experienced guides JP Hauser Jr. and Andy Thatcher. They travel to Russia expecting to find the truth about the unsolved mystery; but they find death instead.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Note: The Dyatlov Pass Incident was a real-life incident which occurred in February 1959 on the Kholat Syakhl mountain, part of the Ural Mountain range in what was then the territory of the Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. Nine hikers of Russian origin died in sub-zero conditions after fleeing their tents into the night on February 2nd for unknown reasons. Soviet investigators, unable to come up with a viable explanation, attributed the deaths to ""compelling natural forces"", closing the case due to a lack of evidence of any criminal element being involved and sealing off the site of the incident for three years. The Incident is still subject to popular scrutiny today by people around the world.Note: This film is of the ""found footage"" genre, and as such, one of the ""students"" (cast members) is always ""filming"" unless stated otherwise.----------------------------------------The film opens with a series of grisly black and white images showing bodies of the nine Russian hikers who died in the 1959 incident, with superimposed text stating they were found dead two weeks later after venturing into the wilderness of the Ural mountains. This has become known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident.We cut to a scene of University of Oregon psychology student Holly King (Holly Goss) who does a short description of the Incident and her intent to make a film together with her fellow student, Jenson Day (Matt Stokoe) for a university project. Their psychology professor, Dr Martha Kittles expects her students to ""do more than come up with more than a believable explanation"", and wants them to put themselves in the place of the original hikers in order to better understand why they did what they did. Day seems highly skeptical of the official account of the Incident, and declares that ""we're gonna find out the truth"".King further outlines the specifics of their trip to Russia, flying from Oregon to Moscow and then to Chelyabinsk, before reaching the mountain. Ominously, she outlines the etymology of their destination, Kholat Syakhl, the ""mountain of the dead"", supposedly named as such by the local Mansi tribe due to a ""number of mysterious deaths and disappearances throughout history"".Joining them are veteran climbers Andy Thatcher (Ryan Hawley), JP Hauser (Luke Albright) and audio engineer Denise Evers (Gemma Atkinson), also students from the university. The team trains on local skiing slopes until they depart for Russia on January 25th.The next scene is a news report on 5 missing Oregon students - ostensibly our protagonists, and describes a search by Russian authorities which discovered remains of a campsite with personal effects belonging to the students. Another news report then comes up, this time a Russian channel, which hosts several ""experts"" who offer theories ranging from a tragic accident to the ""Yeti"", to ""extraterrestrial spaceships"" to account for the missing hikers. Notably, the local inhabitants from the Mansi tribe interviewed have their own theory, where they believe that the disappearance is attributed to a ""place where two worlds collide, where you can step form one world to another into the world of spirits"".In a third (and final) news report, it is stated that authorities recovered video footage shot by the Oregon hikers, refusing to release the contents to the public, and a group of hackers managed to acquire and release the footage instead. Part of it is shot in night-vision mode, showing a terrified Holly crying in the dark while an unnerved Jenson tries to comfort her. The footage cuts to black.One month earlier.We have a scene of happier times, where our students have arrived in Russia and are taking a train from Chelyabinsk to the town of Ivdel. Holly starts interviewing the rest of her crew, questioning their rationales for coming along on the trip. Andy remarks on an angel wing tattoo that Holly has behind her right ear.They arrive in the town of Ivdel, and set about attempting to interview a local inhabitant, Piotr Karov, who was the tenth and final member of the Dyatlov party, but fell sick at the last minute and had to back out of their expedition. Apparently, he had a mental breakdown after the Dyatlov incident and has been warded in the town's psychiatric facility ever since. The students approach the sanitarium, and an orderly-in-charge (Leonid Lutvinskiy) flanked by two other orderlies comes out, and angrily demands that they stop filming, later imploring that they leave and go home. Holly asks why they can't interview Karov, but the in-charge claims that Karov is dead, and again angrily demands that they leave before storming off. Moments later, the students see an old man in the window of an upper floor, and wonder aloud if that is Karov, before the old man holds up a hand-drawn sign with the Russian for ""stay away"" on it. Naturally, our students don't understand, but before Holly can ask the old man to clarify, he is escorted away from the window by two orderlies.That night, they all find a local bar where they meet Sergei, who offers to take them to Vizhai in his truck. Vizhai is the closest town to the trail-head they'll be going on, and the next morning they get to the town. Sergei asks them if they'd like to interview his aunt, who was one of the searchers who went up to recover the Dyatlov group. At the interview, she relates that there were 11 hikers found, not the official 9 and that the last two had a ""machine"" with them and there was something ""more wrong with them than the others"".The party finally heads out on foot. Andy and Denise begin to become playful with each other. They spend the night in their tents and the next morning find large yeti-like footprints around their tents. However, these footprints begin suddenly and end just as suddenly. JP and Andy are not amused and accuse Holly of making the prints. She denies this strongly. At one point during the day they see more prints, and hear strange noises. They find an abandoned weather station and Holly is shocked when she finds a severed human tongue inside it. At a stop, Holly and Jenson are separate from the others and discuss how they each had events in their lives that foreshadowed this trip. With Jenson it was during an acid trip and with Holly it was recurrent nightmares and seeing ""a door"". In the far background are seen two humanoid-looking figures slipping by, but none of the party notices them.The second night, they arrive early at the pass. Too early as it turns out, something strange has happened to time. Also, none of their GPS devices or compasses are working. Jenson and Holly go exploring and pick up radioactivity on their Geiger counter. This leads them to a heavy metal door buried in a hill side. They note that it locks from the outside (to keep something IN), and that the lock is open. However the door is stuck and they decide to go back and not mention it to the others.Around the campfire, Andy and Denise flirt and retire to a tent together where they make love. Holly and JP also pair off. Just at dawn, there is an avalanche that kills Denise and breaks Andy's leg. The avalanche was started by explosives and some of the party speculate that the military is trying to kill them while others ridicule the idea.After much discussion, they decide to fire off a flare gun to summon the local townspeople. Shortly after doing this two men come up and as they approach ask if they are alright. Holly and Jenson become very suspicious about the men because they have arrived way too soon. They begin to run away, leaving Andy, and the two soldiers begin to fire, killing Andy and wounding JP. The party makes it to the door, gets it unstuck, and enters the bunker.Inside they see a power handle and turn it and surprisingly, the lights come on showing two tunnels leading away. They start down the right tunnel, but the lights pop out and so they turn back. In the dark, Holly feels something brush her.Going down the left tunnel, they come to an abandoned and trashed lab. There is a book containing files of Russian soldiers, each one stamped ""killed in action"". There is a wire cell containing numerous meat hooks. And, they come upon a recently-killed soldier who is missing his tongue. Holly speculates that he was sent inside to see if the threat that caused the place to be sealed up is still there. Going through another heavy metal door, they see several skeletons of weird human-like figures.Holly and Jenson leave JP propped against a wall and continue their searching. Amazingly, they find a camera. Jenson's camera. But he still has his camera with him, filming with it at that very moment. This is an exact duplicate right down to having the videos that Jenson has taken on the expedition. Suddenly they see two tall monstrous figures who attack and further injure (eat?) JP. The creatures appear and disappear, teleporting around the cave. They successfully herd Holly and Jenson through another metal door, and the two lock it to keep the monsters out. Apparently they can't teleport through the doors.Inside this last cave is some sort of a portal. Having passed what could be a day there without light most of the time, they decide to go into the portal together, visualizing the area just outside the bunker and hoping it takes them there. There's a bright white light that fills the screen.Now, we are back in 1959. Two figures (presumably Holly and Jenson) are lying outside the bunker. Another two figures (Sergei's aunt and father) come up and discover the bodies, but immediately Russian soldiers interrupt and send them back to the village. The soldiers take the two bodies into the bunker. One begins to swing Jenson's camera around (which is still recording), and then abandons it where it is found later by Holly and Jenson in 2013. The soldiers remark on the unusual ultra modern dress of the two people. They strip them to their undergarments and hang the two, who we now see have mutated into monsters, on meat hooks, and leave. The last scene of the movie is the two monsters (mutated Holly and Jenson) coming out of their comas and looking around."

At nights, sultry and deadly Abby preys on unsuspecting hypocrites, taking great pleasure in bringing them to their knees, and seducing them to death. Without remorse, she is not willing to stop, knowing that she is the cure to a vicious infection. However, when Abby takes under her wing the young trainee nurse, Danni Rogers, dark and incurable suspicions begin to threaten her mentor's silently aggressive crusade with unforeseeable results. Who dares to stand in the way of the nurse's fury?—Nick Riganas The film opens with Abby Russell at a night club where she explains to the audience via a narration that her ""job"" is to murder cheating men in order to ""keep scum off of the streets""- a job that she thoroughly enjoys. She then murders a man by slicing through his femoral artery and then throwing him off the roof of the club.The following day Abby attends a ceremony where she watches Danni Rodgers, a nurse she had been mentoring, graduate. She then approaches her and meets Danni's mother and stepfather Larry Cook. Despite this joyful moment and all of her preparation, Danni is ill prepared for her first true day of nursing duty and is berated by Dr. Morris for her inability to respond quickly to an emergency situation. Abby views the situation with disgust, as she knows that Dr. Morris is a sadist that enjoys harassing new nurses.Abby is further irritated when Danni chooses to call her paramedic boyfriend Steve for support rather than approaching Abby herself. She's pleased when Danni's call to Steve ends badly due to a fight the couple had had previously that night over Danni's refusal to move in with him. She explains her actions to Abby by saying that she is unwilling to trust her stepfather enough to leave him alone with her mother. This distrust is later justified when Abby and Danni witness her stepfather having an affair while the two women are on their way to go drinking at a nightclub.

However unbeknownst to her Abby spikes her drink with drugs, which enables Abby to get Danni to have sex with both her and random strangers.The next day Danni wakes to find herself in Abby's apartment and leaves despite Abby's entreaties for Danni to skip work and spend the day with her.

He gives her his phone number to contact him anytime she wishes, which seems to confirm Abby's suspicions that Larry is a cheater. She later approaches him while he's leaving his office and convinces him to give her a ride, which enables her to murder him by paralyzing him in his car with vecuronium bromide and putting it in reverse, which causes him to get into a car accident.After hearing of her stepfather's death Danni seeks solace from Abby, only for Abby to grow angry when Danni says that she's going to move in with her boyfriend. Abby comments that she hopes that Larry's genitals were cut off in the car crash, only for Danni to reveal that she had never told Abby how her stepfather had died and quickly leave. This infuriates Abby, who decides that instead of seeking to help Danni, she will now hurt her. She accomplishes this by slowly convincing Detective John Rogan that Danni is mentally unstable and obsessed with Abby.The next day, Abby runs into Rachel Owens, a cheerful new human resources employee that remarks that Abby greatly resembles a girl she knew that was sent to a mental institution. Abby invites Rachel out for drinks and takes the opportunity to harass Danni by calling her via Skype and showing Danni a video of Abby injecting chemicals into Rachel. Danni tries to go to the police, only for Detective Rogan to dismiss her claims as evidence of her trying to hurt Abby because the other woman didn't return her affections. He uses the photographs Abby took as proof to this effect, which Steve sees as a result of Danni calling him to the police station for support. This prompts an argument between the two and Steve leaves in a fit of anger. Danni tries to approach Dr. Morris for help, only for him to use this as an opportunity to blackmail Abby into having sex with him. Abby initially pretends to agree to this arrangement but soon shows that it was only a way for her to get him alone so she could dismember and murder him. That same night Abby also knocks out Rachel and drags her away to her death.Meanwhile, Danni goes to the mental institution that Rachel had referred to, seeking answers about what is going on. There, she learns about Sarah Price, a little girl who killed her father after witnessing him not only having an affair but also severely beating her mother for coming to his office unannounced. Danni also discovers that Sarah was taken in by one of the nurses at the institution, a woman named Abigail Russell. Danni then realizes that that Abby is Sarah and has since taken the name of her caretaker. Danni then tries to call Rachel to warn her about Abby, only to find that Rachel's phone is in her car. She then receives a call from Abby, who implies that she will kill Steve in the same manner as Rachel.Danni rushes to the hospital, where she and Abby begin to get into a violent fistfight. The staff initially tries to intervene, only for Abby to set off on a killing spree and lock herself into a lab. Danni and Steve finally manage to get inside, only for Abby (who had hidden in one of the patients' beds) to stab Steve in the neck and run off.Abby rushes home to grab some essentials but is confronted by Detective Rogan, who tries to arrest her. Noticing that her neighbor Jared is viewing the situation, Abby pretends that Rogan is trying to rob her. Her neighbor then comes outside and hits the detective over the head with a bat, killing him instantly. Her neighbor is horrified to discover that Rogan is a cop, but Abby convinces him to hide the body, saying that Rogan was corrupt and that Jared would be treated badly since he is now a cop killer.In the final scene, Abby is shown to have assumed a new identity at another hospital... that of human resources employee Rachel Owens."
Deseo,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1236434/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A succession of erotic encounters weaved into a daisy chain of delightful sensuality. DESEO is a modern-day adaptation of Reigen, the controversial stage-play by the celebrated XIX century Austrian playwright, Arthur Schnitzler. From a casual encounter between a teenage prostitute and a sailor, we will follow a chain of relationships between archetypal characters representing the different strata of society polarized in Mexico, where sexual desire, due to class, state and racial prejudice, will never develop in love. Although perhaps someone could break the invisible barrier and come to the feeling of what we all desire. DESEO is based on Arthur Schnitzler's 'Reigen' (Viena, 1897), arguably one of the major scandals on the European theatre scene of the 20th Century (recently reconfigured for London's West End by David Hare as 'The Blue Room' -staged by Sam Mendes and performed by Nicole Kidman and Iain Glen).A tragic expose of the decadence of the aristocracy (drawing striking similarities between 19th Vienese and contemporary Mexican societies), it is a fable, a burlesque of the cicle of venereal contagion through all rungs of society, with the cadence of a 'roundelay'; a humorous merry-go-round of illicit erotic encounters.Outrageously faithful to the play's piquant satirical tone, the film sketches the ardors of concupiscence, lust for power, seduction and disillusionment in all walks of life, as it challenges and mocks many sacrosanct notions about prudery and hypocrisy.While Schnitzler's hilarious play was said to depict the ""merciless mechanism of sex"" without actually showing it, the film does have a highly erotic allure, as it is beautifully wrought. However, in it's undercurrent, ""DESEO"" thouches upon more deleterious and tragical hungers.Zavala Kugler aptly intertwtines the distinct passages with artful dexterity. The mesmerizing selection of music underscores the dramatic structure while becoming at times part of the cast which, without exception, is undoubtedly ""la crème de la crème"" of Mexican performing arts.DESEO is a splendid consummation of Schnitzler's play, masterfully adapted to modern-day Latin America.- - by Steffi Meyer"

In the manga illustrated by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after the conclusion of the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukino who had hoped to see him in the park.[7] Also, at the conclusion of the story, Yukino is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her.[8]"

Swaddled in wealth and excess, Scott and Liberace have a long affair, one that Scott eventually begins to find suffocating. Kept away from the outside world by his flashily effeminate yet deeply closeted partner, and submitting to extreme makeovers and even plastic surgery at the behest of his lover, Scott eventually rebels. When Liberace finds himself a new lover, Scott is tossed onto the street. He then seeks legal redress for what he feels he has lost. But throughout, the bond between the young man and the star never completely tears.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> In 1977, 18-year-old Scott Thorson (Matt Damon), who is working as an animal trainer on a movie set, meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula), a Hollywood producer, in a gay bar in Los Angeles. At Black's urging, he leaves his adopted home and foster parents Joe and Rose (Garrett M. Brown and Jane Morris) and goes off in search of better-paying work. Black takes Scott to Las Vegas, where they see a live stage show of Liberace (Michael Douglas). Afterwards, Black takes Thorson to the backstage dressing room of Liberace, who takes an immediate liking to the handsome younger man. However, Liberace's co-performer and fellow piano player Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) is cold and avoids Scott and Bob, despite their attempts to be friendly.Liberace invites the two men to his luxurious home in Las Vegas. Scott observes that one of Liberace's beloved dogs is suffering from a temporary form of blindness, and with his veterinary assistant background, informs the famous pianist that he knows how to cure the condition. After treating the dog, Scott becomes Liberace's ""assistant"" at the performer's request.Scott moves in with Liberace and soon becomes his lover. Scott even becomes part of Liberace's stage act, playing his chauffeur to drive him onstage in a Rolls Royce automobile for his performances. In the meantime, Billy Leatherwood is cut from Liberace's stage act and leaves town after receiving a large payoff from Liberace's management team.After another night of lovemaking, Scott confides in Liberace that he is bisexual because he is also attracted to women. Liberace is sympathetic, informing him that he wanted and tried to love women, but was exclusively attracted to men. Liberace relates a story of a ""divine healing"" where in November 1963 he nearly died from acute kidney failure, but claims to have had a near-death experience in which a ""messenger"" informed him that he would not die, and that God still loved him.However, flaws in Scott's life with Liberace begin to appear. Carlucci (Bruce Ramsey), Liberace's live-in ""houseboy"", disapproves of Scott and privately warns him that Liberace sooner or later will discard him as he's done with ""many teenage boys"" in the past. Liberace's long-term manager, Seymour Heller (Dan Aykroyd), also disapproves of Scott and is overly loyal to Liberace in protecting Liberace's (who is called Lee) sexual orientation from the public at all costs, for he believes that if Liberace would ever come clean about being gay, he would lose literally everything.It gradually becomes clear that Liberace is trying to mold Scott into a younger version of himself. In 1979, after turning 60, Liberace requests his plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe) to do a complete face-lift for himself to make him appear younger. Liberace also requests that Dr. Startz transform Scott's face to more closely resemble his own. Liberace also makes an unsuccessful attempt to formally adopt Scott, as gay unions were not yet legal or typically socially acceptable. Scott soon turns to drugs (first pain pills, and later cocaine) as he becomes more angry and frustrated with Liberace trying to control him, as well as Liberace's obsession to publicly hide their romance at any cost.In 1980, Liberace's mother (Debbie Reynolds), whom he always adored, dies and he holds a funeral. Scott is troubled by Liberace's lack of grief over his mother's death as he remarks that he is ""finally free.""In 1981, Scott's increasing drug abuse and Liberace's promiscuity towards younger men creates a rift that ultimately destroys their relationship. Liberace begins moving away from Scott by viewing gay porn videotapes and even takes Scott on an excursion to an adult bookstore and porn shop just as Scott is going through a drug withdrawal.In 1982, when Liberace suggests to Scott that they begin seeing other people, Scott becomes upset and goes on a drug bender. When Scott learns that his foster mother has died, he goes to Los Angeles for her funeral; when he returns to Las Vegas, he finds that Liberace has taken in yet another young man, a dancer in his show named Cary James (Boyd Holbrook) whom he hires as his new ""personal assistant"". Now Scott becomes cold, angry and withdrawn and begins giving Liberace a hard time (exactly like Billy Leatherwood had done previously when Scott first met him backstage).After an angry and verbal alternation with Liberace, Scott is then thrown out on the street with all his things in plastic garbage bags by Seymour and his personal security guards; Seymour tells Scott, in a rude tone, to never make contact with Liberace again. Scott moves in with Bob Black, who persuades Scott to take Liberace to court with the fact that he should be entitled to half of what Liberace has.In 1984, Scott retains an attorney (Paul Reiser) to seek his financial share of the property by suing Liberace for over $100 million in palimony. During Scott's palimony lawsuit, he gives details about his five-year romance with the entertainer, while Liberace flatly denies any sexual relationship or giving any gifts or items to Scott, with the exception of three valuable gold rings (aware that Scott had already pawned them for cash to buy cocaine for himself). However, Liberace's lawyer (Josh Meyers) offers Scott a settlement which is $75,000 in cash along with three of his cars, and three dogs totaling another $20,000, in exchange for dropping his claim to Scott's $250,000 Las Vegas house that Liberace bought for him as well as sign a clause to prohibit Scott from ever revealing the true nature of his relationship with him. On his lawyer's advice, Scott reluctantly agrees to settle, since no court has recognized a same-sex relationship in a palimony suit, and because he is broke from spending all of his money on drugs.Some time later, Scott is working as a clerk in a post office somewhere in Los Angeles when one day he notices a customer carrying a book about Liberace. Scott goes to a bookstore where he views a copy of Liberace's personal picture book titled 'The Wonderful Private World of Liberace' containing photos of his luxurious homes as well as anecdotes by 'Lee' about his ""straight"" way of life. Scott leaves the store without purchasing the book. He passes by a Los Angeles newspaper stack dated October 3, 1985, with the front page cover detailing actor Rock Hudson's death from AIDS.The following year on Christmas Day 1986, Scott - living alone in a small condo apartment - receives a phone call from Liberace who, speaking in a very weak voice, asks Scott to come visit him at his house in Palm Springs. The following day, Scott drives to Palm Springs and is shocked to find the entertainer bedridden and dying of AIDS. Liberace thanks Scott for coming to visit, saying that he only wanted to see Scott one last time before he died. He gives Scott one of his gold rings by his nightstand as a reminder to him, and makes Scott promise never to tell anyone that he saw him like this, saying ""I don't want anyone to remember me as just another gay queen who died of AIDS.""Not long thereafter (on February 4, 1987), Liberace dies. Despite efforts to hide the true nature of his death by Seymour and Liberace's immediate family, reporters force a legal inquiry which reveals that Liberace indeed died of AIDS. Scott attends Liberace's funeral in Los Angeles, during which he imagines seeing Liberace performing one last time on stage with his traditional flamboyance, before being lifted to Heaven with a stage harness."

The Colony,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160996/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Forced underground by the next ice age, a struggling outpost of survivors must fight to preserve humanity against a threat even more savage than nature. Groups of people - colonies - are forced underground due to another ice age. Colony 7 goes to check on Colony 5, which they lost contact with. When they get there they find that the colony has fallen and there is a whole new enemy that they have to face on their way back.—James Medeiros A terrified woman (Alex Paxton-Beesley) and a man (Eric Murdoc) run in a corridor. They are running away from something or someone. They reach the end of the corridor and they bang on the door, shouting for somebody else to open up the door.In a grim future world, when people have to live underground because on our planet a new Ice Age has begun, the scarce survivors try keep civilization while waiting for a better future. Briggs (Laurence Fishburne) is the leader of one of these underground places, called colonies. Colony 7 has its own problems. The lack of food and medicine make something as ""mild"" nowadays as the flu really dangerous, which can lead to a disaster of epidemic proportions. Briggs tries to keep civilization in Colony 7. He has organized a system of 40-day quarantine, to give people the opportunity to get over the flu. After a flu epidemy has killed twenty people within the colony, he has devised a system in which people who are sick after the quarantine period is given a choice: they may be killed, or they may try to live outside, on their own, and try to survive by their own means. Not everybody agrees with these system, though. Mason (Bill Paxton) kills Hal (Sten Eirik), a man who couldn't get over the flu completely, in fear that he would eventually return to the colony, as there is no way for a single human to survive for long in the frozen prairie which our planet has become.Sam (Kevin Zegers) has told Mason to let Hal go, as he has chosen to leave. Hal says that it's not a choice, it's survival, and one less person will mean more food for the rest. Sam explains that people from the cities which reached one of the colonies considered themselves lucky to reach one of the colonies. At the beginning, they had to make do with crammed conditions, but then, people's life expectancy started to dwindle, and now, they are not crammed at all. At colony 7, attempts to keep seeds for when the Ice Age finishes have been done. Sam tells Briggs that Mason killed Hal - Briggs doesn't like that.An SOS from Colony 5 is pulsing two days after the colonizers had said that they were disconecting the radio for some repairs. All the inhabitants of the Colony are called in for a meeting. Briggs tells Mason off, but he makes his disgust clear. Kai (Charlotte Sullivan) is Sam's girlfriend. She keeps seeds locked - she has her laptop connected to an old satellite. When Sam tells her that Hal ""has died"", she is more accepting. In the meeting, people are on the merge of freezing. Two people are trying to disguise the fact that they are suffering from the flue. Sam says she's already fixed the ventilation system, but for them, it's too late.In this meeting, Briggs says that he'll go to Colony 5, and that he needs two volunteers to go with him. As usual, Mason disagrees - if they bring more people to their own colony, food would be even more scarce. Sam offers himself to go, as Kai will be the person responsible for the turbines' maintenance. Graydon (Atticus Dean Mitchell) offers to go, even though he doesn't have much experience on being on the ground. When Elena ( Kristin Shepherd) coughs, the meeting is called off sooner, as everybody panics. She and her husband are put in quarantine. Briggs says that Kai will be the leader while he's away.That night, Sam dreams of himself as a child (Mitchell Nye), lost in a polar storm, dressed in fur, watching his parents' dead bodies. Sam wakes up and goes to wash his face. Kai also wakes up, They kiss each other.Briggs, Sam and Grayson leave the colony in the freezing cold. Sam looks at the overwhelming frozen desert outside the colony, and reminisces of stories he heard when he was a child. Global warming brought the ice age. One day, it began to snow, and it has never stopped since. Humans tried to change the weather back with some tall structures, - they have to pass the remains of one - but they didn't really work. Later, they have to cross a frozen bridge, full of holes. The river below looks half-iced, but it is not considered safe to cross it on foot. In the middle of the bridge, they find a frozen truck. The dead body of a man lies outside, with a gun by his side; inside lies the dead body of a woman which was shot in the forehead - probably killed by the man outside in desperation when their truck got stuck and they couldn't cross the damaged bridge on it. The three of them also find an emergency helicopter which was used to evacuate people. Inside, they find a caption written on the frozen mist on a window ""HELL HAS FROZEN OVER"". They use walkie-talkies to communicate with their colony: they are told that the couple is still sick with the flu. Briggs tell them to wait until he comes back. They will sleep inside the helicopter and then move onto Colony 7, which they will reach by midday the following day. Grayson looks at two models in bikinis, Nadia and Crystal - Sam and Briggs can see he's enjoying the experience a lot. Sam says he can't remember when he saw the sun for the last time.When they finally arrive to Colony 5, they see a blood trail outside. Briggs says that they have come to help, so that they should enter anyway, in spite of Graydon's concerns. They smell of smoke, threw a light to see how deep the chimney goes, and they go down by the hand ladder. Graydon would have rather wait outside, but Sam tells him to come down with them.Inside, there are pools of blood everywhere. The three men move around quietly. They find a terrified sleeping man who insists in having the door closed. Leland (Julian Richinds) shows them a message they found: a colony has succeeded in making one of the weather towers towers, melting the ice, dispersing the clouds and even bringing in fertile soil. Briggs writes the localization of the spot, which is the only unclear part of the message. The who speaks is sending out a message, as they haven't got seeds to plant on that soil, so they ask for some other colony's collaboration. Colony 7 sent out some people to that place, which lies outside of Briggs' map, but nobody has returned. Briggs wants to take Leland back with them, but he doesn't want to go. He says that there's somebody else in the colony. Some weird noises are heard. Leland pushes the three of them out, and he locks himself in his communications room again.The three travellers wander around the compound in search of the origin of the pounding. They see a man butchering human remains, and some deformed people - they look like the product of miscegenation - feasting on other human beings. The butcher realises they are there and ties to attack them with their butcher's knife. Briggs and Sam shoot some people while running away. They use a hand bomb to give themselves more time to run. Graydon is attacked by several cannibals. Although Briggs and Sam help him, Graydon dies, and his two friends have to leave his body behind.The cannibals run after the two survivors. Briggs and Leader of the cannibals (Dru Viergever) look at each other, measuring their own strengths. Briggs blows out the entrance of the place, saying that the inhabitants of Colony 7 are beyond their help. They have to rest in the helicopter in spite of the danger, because temperatures are descending dangerously. They are sad for Graydon.The cannibals chase them. Briggs and Sam have to hump a huge hole. Briggs uses dynamite to blow up the bridge, delaying them for a while. Briggs has to set fire to the dynamite again. Finally, the dynamite goes off, creating a huge gap in the bridge but killing Briggs at the same time. The leader stares menacingly at Sam, who runs away to his colony.Sam arrives at Colony 7. Mason kills Elena instead of doing the flu test to her. Kai aims her gun at Mason, but at that moment, Sam arrives. Kai runs to him. Sam faints and Mason uses his shotgun to knock Kai down. When Sam wakes up, he is put in the infirmary and is handcuffed by Mason. Mason nominates himself as the leader, saying that he will reduce food rations by half. Mason doesn't believe Sam when he tells about the cannibals.A boy steals the keys to the cuffs - a boy which Briggs had kindly reprimanded before. Sam frees Kai. Mason learns that Sam has escaped. Sam and Kai look for the location of the ice-free area though Kai's connection to that old satellite. They find a spot of a 12-km gap of blue cloudless sky. Sam takes some random seeds and throws them into his handbag. Mason won't let him and Kai go - he doesn't believe Sam's words yet. Immediately, they listen to the bumping made by the invading cannibals. Sam tells that it's too late now, and that he'll be the king of an empty castle. Mason orders everybody to go to the meeting hall in order to defend the colony. Mason accuses Sam of showing the cannibals their location. The power goes off, and back on. The cannibals try to attack them from their back. The cannibals are moving through the ventilating system. Sam kills a cannibal who was attacking Mason on his back.Sam suggests to leave the place, but some of them want to fight. As they are outnumbered by the cannibals, Sam tells everybody to go back to the meeting hall. A few survivors try to leave through the ventilating system, and one of them stays behind to blow everything up. The leader of the cannibals survive. He and Sam fight face to face. The leader looks to be winning - he shows Sam his sharp pointed teeth while the room starts to burn. Sam hits him with an iron bar, beating him repeatedly in a frenzy. Sam is about to leave, but the leader stops him. Sam uses a butcher knife to cut his head in half.A small group of people succeed in leaving Colony 7. Mason stares at the burning remains. Sam shows them a tin of some produce, and he tells them that they have what they need to survive.They are leaving in search of the warm place.---written by KrystelClaire"

Two artificial intelligence engineers come together as they work to create the first ever self-aware artificial intelligence. A veteran AI engineer secretly hopes to develop technology to help his diseased daughter, even if it means funding comes from the powerful Ministry of Defence (MoD). His new partner, a young woman gifted in the field of AI, is brought on after her breakthroughs are recognized by the MoD. Things go wrong when the MoD takes over and advances the researchers' work to the next level, teaching the AI to kill and follow MoD instructions with its new and nearly indestructible body.—Paul Threatt Set in the future and with the world plunged in economic crisis a new cold war with China, Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is on the verge of developing the world's first artificially intelligent robotic soldier. The robot sounds and looks human but has amazing strength, speed, and agility. When the defense project gets close to completion, the AI controlled robot is pulled from the research and testing phase and thrust into military training mode. The child-like AI is traumatized by the transition, the way a pit bull puppy might be when brutalized for similar purposes. In a broad effort to preserve itself and those it has come to care about, the AI robot and a posse of cyborg veterans working within the MoD stage a lethal takeover of the research facility.—Paul Threatt In a near future, with China at war against the West, the UK government develops war machines to fight against them. Scientist Vincent works in a military base developing artificial intelligence for the Ministry of Defense, using soldiers near death in his experiments; however, his true intention is to find a cure to his daughter Mary that has Rett Syndrome. When Vincent meets scientist Ava who has developed an advanced AI, he invites her to work with him for the Defense Department; however, Ava's snoop around the base prompts Chief of Research Thomson into simulating a Chinese attempt to kill her. Vincent decides to use Ava's face and shape to build an indestructible AI Machine. Soon he discovers the Machine developing feelings and growing up as a human being. When Mary gets worse and has to be submitted to surgery, Vincent learns that the Machine has life and is in love with him, but Thomson wants to transform her in a killing machine for the military.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the future, amid a cold war with China, scientists employed by Britain's Ministry of Defence produce a cybernetic implant that allows brain-damaged soldiers to regain lost functions. Scientist Vincent McCarthy sets up a cognitive test for soldier Paul Dawson, a recipient of the cybernetic implant. Upset with Dawson's apparent solipsism and lack of empathy, McCarthy ignores Dawson's requests to see his mother. Dawson turns hostile, kills a scientist and wounds McCarthy, before apologizing and being shot. Afterwards, Dawson's mother regularly protests at the base, though McCarthy denies that her son was ever there.McCarthy's research leads to a series of more stable cyborgs. Although they lose the capability for human speech, the cyborgs develop a highly efficient method of communication that they keep secret. After she demonstrates her latest work in artificial intelligence, McCarthy recruits Ava, by promising her unlimited funds for her research. Thomson, the director, is suspicious of Ava's countercultural politics and sympathy for Dawson's mother but he relents when McCarthy insists that she is the only one who can provide the necessary programme for their latest project, a self-aware and conscious android. McCarthy plans to use this technology to help his daughter Mary, who suffers from Rett syndrome, a neurological disorder. When she finds out, Ava volunteers to help and McCarthy maps her brain.During a demonstration of cybernetic arms that provide superhuman strength, amputee soldier James whispers a cry for help to Ava, who becomes suspicious of the treatment of the wounded soldiers. After she goes exploring in the base, McCarthy sternly warns her to avoid causing trouble. The warning comes too late and Thomson arranges to have her murdered by a Chinese agent, who impersonates Dawson's mother. Grieved by the loss of Ava, McCarthy insists that they use her brain scan and likeness for the new project, whom they dub Machine. Machine turns out to be more human than they expected or even wanted; she shows regret when she accidentally kills a human and refuses orders that violate her sense of morality. As Thomson's demands on her grow more at odds with her morality, Machine becomes increasingly distressed and asks McCarthy to protect her.An antagonism grows between Thomson and McCarthy; Thomson promises that he will relent if McCarthy can prove that Machine is sentient. After Mary dies, Thomson uses her brain scans as leverage against McCarthy, threatening to destroy the scans, unless McCarthy excises Machine's consciousness. Machine, who has come to love McCarthy, offers to sacrifice herself for Mary and he removes a chip from Machine's head. Thomson reneges on his deal and orders Machine to kill McCarthy. Although Machine seems at first to obey, a scientist alerts Thomson that the operation was a sham and it only disabled fail-safe routines designed to destroy Machine. Machine and the cyborgs rebel against the humans and free McCarthy.From his computer console, Thomson disables half the cyborgs but Suri, his cyborg aide, overrides his access before he can kill the rest. Thomson shoots and wounds Suri but Machine corners him in his office; wounded, he first orders her to obey, then begs for his life. Although Machine agrees not to kill him, she lobotomizes him, as he attempted to do to her. After leaving Thomson for dead, Machine downloads Mary's brain scan. Machine, McCarthy and Suri escape the base; outside, McCarthy hands the base records to Dawson's mother and leaves to start a new life with Machine. In the final scene, McCarthy talks to a computer virtualisation of his daughter and she requests to play a game with her mother. McCarthy hands the tablet to Machine, and she is then shown gazing alternately at the device and at a beautiful orange sunset over the Atlantic Ocean."

Between their way towards a cartoon movie they stop for awhile to meet Chaitnya Mishra (Vineeth Kumar), Rahul's best friend for a quick audition of struggling actor Rahul. Kali rejects to come with him and she sits in the car on a crowded Mumbai street and ask Rahul to come back soon. Rahul waits for his friend Chaitnya at his home leaving car parked with Kali in the street.While waiting Kali sees a mask-vendor who is trying to sell animal masks and Kali is attracted (but does not get out of car,presumably) Chaitnya comes after few minutes to meet Rahul and says Kali is not in the car and the door was open. Rahul runs to find and Chaitnya follows him. They ask everyone on street if they saw any little girl but nobody answer. Chaitnya spots the mask vendor Shrilal (Murari Kumar) and ask him but Srilal do not answer and stare instead. Chaitnya sees that Shrilal is having iPhone of Kali and ask him how did he had that phone. Shrilal runs and both Rahul and chaitnya follows. In a long chase, Shrilal gets hit by a car/truck and dies instantly.Rahul and Chaitnya goes to police station to meet Inspector Rane (Sandesh Jadhav) to file missing report of Kali and death of Shrilal. While the continues unwanted, not-so-funny questions by Rane and his team to Rahul, Rane ask Rahul's home number to call. Rane realise after dialing that the number belongs to his Head and Senior Inspector Shoumik BoseRonit Roywho is a very rough, rude but yet respected and honest police officer. Thus concluding that Shoumik is step-father of Kali. Rane calls Shoumik and he arrives instantly at police station. Police goes to Shrilal's house to see if he has kept Kali there but there is only Shrilal's aged aunt who denies having kidnapped any kid. Police search arounds but do not found Kali. Shoumik hits Rahul and Chaitnya very much and we see in flashback that all Shoumik, Rahul and Shalini were in same college where Shoumik and Rahul both wanted Shalini but Shalini was attracted to much handsome Rahul and Shoumik was teased a lot. In today, Shoumik blams Rahul for the kidnapping of Kali because he can't meet her daily and Shalini keeps her away from him because of his drinking habit. But later it is revealed that Kali is not kidnapped by Rahul.Chaitnya, who is having lots of pending dues to pay make a fake call to the Rahul asking for a ransom amount of Rs. 10 Lacs but before Rahul can arrange money Chaintnya's call is traced and Rane catches and again hits Chaitnya very much to find out if he has Kali. Shoumik ask Rahul to talk with Chaitnya to find out where is Kali but it is revealed again after few scenes that Chaitnya is also not behind the kidnapping. Between we again see a flashback that after marrying Rahul, Shalini was not happy since Rahul didn't had any job as actor and they lived in a very small room without money for very long. Kali was born and aged 5 years around. Chaitnya visits Shalini and Shalini who is angry and bored from money-less dull life and fighting life mixes a very little amount of sleeping powder in Kali's milk for her own greed of satisfaction and spends night with Chaitnya. Shoumik married Shalini when once Shalini was beaten cruelly by Rahul but Shoumik never loved Shalini the way a husband do.We are introduced by Rakhi Malhotra who is best friend of Shalini but is having affair with Shalini's first husband Rahul leaving her own husband aside. Rakhi is a struggling actor like Rahul and is out of money. She also takes advantage of Kali's kidnapping by calling for ransom and asking sum of Rupees 20 Lacs. To arrange this money Rahul goes to loot a jewelry store but is failed. Other than this, Shalini's brother Siddhant (Siddharth Kapoor) who is a local smuggler and is out of money also tries to dig gold by calling Shalini for ransom and asks 50 lacs. Shalini, again, greedy for money and bored from husband adds her own amount and ask from her father total of 65 lacs for ransom and says that kidnapper has strictly said not to tell Shoumik about this. Her Father arranges money and Shalini after deducting her own amount and gives rest to Siddhant not knowing that it is him who is asking and not any kidnapper. Shoumik comes to know this and goes to Shalini shouting that she cheated her father - and ask where is remaining amount and Kali is not coming home this way. We see in flashback that Shalini has asked Rakhi to keep 15 lacs secure. but Rakhi runs away with money including team of Chaitnya and Rahul. Shoumik tells this to Shalini and an outraged Shalini shoots Shoumik with gun and Shoumik is injured on shoulder. Siddhanth is caught red-handded with money.Later, Shalini runs away from home without saying any thing. Shoumik, after not finding his daughter seating alone attends a call from Rahul where Rahul tease Shoumik but he is not affected by any of it and says whether or not Rahul is having Kali with him; just answer yes or no. Rahul puts the phone down and hits Chaitnya shouting that Chaitnya ensured Rahul that Shoumik is behind Kali's kidnapping but he does not have her and Chaitnya did all of these for money and Rahul (assumably) kills Chaitnya in that fight. While this, Rakhi runs away with all money alone.Next day we see that police department gets a call complaining about Shrilal's old-aged aunt from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh police station for child-kidnapping. A police detective meets the aunt and tells her if she knows anything about Kali then speak. She does not say anything but later she approaches the same deserted market area from where Kali was missing very early morning and police detective follows her. Later, police detective call Shoumik to come with team at same place as Kali is found. In the last scene of movie, Shoumik and his team comes to that discarded area of market, where Kali was kept bounded from hand and mouth and she is dead. Her whole body is fungus-ed. due to being dead from last so many days. police detective tells Shoumik that she was here the whole time and we could have saved her. She was drugged and kidnapped by Shrilal.The story tells us a reality of the cruel world by depicting money-greed friend, outraged first husband, senseless brother, money derived and betraying friend and wife and rude police officer. All of them wanted more than what they already had and while all of this - they all lost a little innocent girl. It is seen that even though none of them can be blamed - all of them were murderer."

He finds his house, where his sister Adriana (Charlotte Rampling) lives, and soon he discovers that Amadeu is dead. Raimund decides to research the life of Amadeu, who was a doctor and writer that belonged to the resistance against the Dictator Salazar, and his discoveries affect his own boring life.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Professor Raimund Gregorius (Jeremy Irons), a teacher of Classics at a Bern, Switzerland institution, leads a lonely and staid existence. One rainy day while walking to work, he prevents a young woman from committing suicide. After losing track of her, he becomes obsessed with finding her to make sure she's all right, he going solely on what he knows, namely the bridge where she tried to jump, her red coat which she left behind, and a Portuguese language booked titled ""Um Ourives das Palavras"" (A Goldsmith of Words) by Amadeu de Almeida Prado (Jack Huston) and a train ticket to Lisbon in the coat pocket. Dropping everything in his life, Raimund decides to use the train ticket to see if he can find her there. En route to Lisbon, Raimund reads the book and becomes equally obsessed with finding all he can about the author due to the touching philosophies of life contained in the book, such philosophies which Raimund always contemplates, and how the book and/or the author is connected to the young woman. Upon arriving in Lisbon, Raimund initially learns that Amadeu de Almeida Prado was a medical doctor who originally wanted to be a philosopher and writer, that this book is his only published work, of which only one hundred copies were ever printed, and that he died a young man of thirty-three in 1974. If Raimund does learn the entire story, he will discover one of commitment to knowledge, repression, love, and betrayal, those items which still affect the living, such as that young woman, and may ultimately affect what happens in Raimund's own life.—Huggo Raimund Gregorius is a Latin teacher from Berne. When he encounters a book by the Portuguese poet and doctor Amadeu de Prado, he drops everything and takes the night train to Lisbon. He is determined to find out more about this writer who appears to have been obsessed by the very same questions that plague him: the purpose of human deeds and the unrealised potential of each and every life. Bern, Switzerland. While walking over a bridge on his way to a local university, Raimund Gregorius (Jeremy Irons), a Swiss professor of ancient languages, notices a young woman in a red coat standing on the railing, about to jump. Dropping his briefcase, he runs and pulls her down. She helps him gather the papers that have spilled from his briefcase and accompanies him to the school where he teaches. But instead of waiting to talk, she leaves during the middle of his class, without her coat.Concerned, Raimund grabs the coat and runs after her, but fails to find her. He checks her pockets for identification. All he finds is a small book, a memoir of sorts, by Amadeu do Prado. It is stamped with the address of the bookstore, so he goes there. The bookseller remembers the girl purchasing this obscure book. As he leafs through it, a train ticket to Lisbon, Portugal falls out. The train is, in fact, leaving in 15 minutes. Confused and doubtful, Raimund rushes to the station, but the woman is nowhere in sight. At the last moment he decides to use the ticket himself, and during the journey he reads the book.According to the book, Amadeu do Prado lived in Lisbon, so Raimund searches for him, hoping that this will lead to the woman. He finds Amadeu's home, where he is welcomed in by the writer's sister Adriana (Charlotte Rampling). She gives the impression he still lives there. Raimund learns that Amadeu is a doctor, and that only 100 copies of the book were printed. When Raimund asks what happened to their father, Adriana's reaction is hostile. As he is leaving, the maid informs him that he can find Amadeu in the town's cemetery. He finds the tomb: Amadeu died in 1974.On the street, Raimund is hit by a bicyclist and smashes his glasses. While obtaining new glasses from a local optician, Mariana (Martina Gedeck), he narrates his experiences. When he collects the glasses, she tells him in fact that her uncle knew Amadeu do Prado well and would like to talk to Raimund.Raimund and his lovely new-found friend Mariana both go to the nursing home where her uncle João Eça resides (Tom Courtenay). João explains that he and Amadeu were both in the resistance against the Salazar dictatorship, a story told in continuing flashbacks as the film continues.Raimund then visits the priest Father Bartolomeu (Christopher Lee) who taught and also buried Amadeu do Prado. In another long flashback, the priest explains that Amadeu, a smart young boy from an aristocratic background, befriended Jorge O'Kelly (August Diehl), another bright boy in the school though of lowly means. They bonded through their love for knowledge, particularly the philosophical and political knowledge not permitted under Salazar. Amadeu gave a graduation speech that reflected his contempt for the regime, much to the chagrin of his father, a well respected judge.Raimund returns to Adriana and asks for her side of the story, and then visits João again for more information. He learns that Amadeu died of an aneurysm, which he knew he had, but had not told her about. As a doctor, Amadeu never refused a patient, and when a powerful member of the Salazar regime Rui Luís Mendes, called ""the Butcher of Lisbon"", was brought to Amadeu's clinic, he saved the man's life. Amadeu's friends were shocked by this, especially Jorge, who at that time was already in the resistance.Later, Amadeu confronted Jorge and declared that he too would join the resistance. Jorge introduced him to João and to Estefânia (Mélanie Laurent), a beautiful woman who helped the resistance by memorizing people's names and contact information, and who they were both attracted to. When the revolution against Salazar began, Amadeu was able to smuggle Estefânia to safety in Spain. Raimund learns where she went and goes there to see that she is still alive. The older Estefania (Lena Olin) tells Raimund about her romance with Amadeu before her fleeing into exile.Raimund finally meets the woman from the bridge again, in Lisbon; she had felt suicidal because she had just learned from the book that her beloved grandfather was the Butcher of Lisbon, but is learning to accept this.The events become a catalyst to Raimund's life, in a gentle sort of way. He informs the school that he is now returning to his job. In the final scene, Mariana goes to the railway station with him and, at the last moment, suggests he could instead stay."

Tom at the Farm,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2427892/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A grieving man meets his lover's family, who were not aware of their son's sexual orientation. The story of Tom, who is in the grip of grief and depression following the death of his lover. When he meets the family of the deceased, it is revealed the mother was not aware of her son's sexual orientation, or his relationship with Tom either, for that matter.—Indie Montréal based mid-twentysomethings Tom Podowski and Guillaume Longchamp are coworkers and lovers. Upon Guillaume's death, Tom heads to the rural town where Guillaume grew up and where his mother Agathe Longchamp still lives, there where the funeral will be held. Upon Tom's arrival at the Longchamp dairy farm home, he learns that Agathe has no idea of Tom's role in Guillaume's life or that Guillaume was gay. Tom also learns that Guillaume had made up a fake girlfriend for Agathe's benefit, he using a real person in his life, his and Tom's coworker Sarah Thibault, as who he would tell his mother as being his girlfriend. As such, Tom does not divulge he and Guillaume being lovers to Agathe, who in turn is angry that Sarah is not coming for the funeral. Tom further learns that Guillaume has a thirty year old brother, Francis Longchamp, who runs the farm, knew about Guillaume's homosexual orientation and knows Tom's role in Guillaume's life. Without Agathe's knowledge, Francis lets Tom know in no uncertain terms through threats and borderline violence that he does not welcome Tom, but that Tom is to stay for the funeral to provide comfort to Agathe as a touchstone to Guillaume's Montréal life, about which she basically knows nothing beyond Sarah. Throughout Tom's stay with the Longchamps, Francis' treatment of Tom changes to one of passive-aggression. Tom, in turn, begins to get sucked into life at the farm, despite or perhaps because of Francis' violent treatment, as Tom learns more about Guillaume's past, about Agathe and most specifically about Francis.—Huggo"

Warrioress,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723129/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two powerful female warriors must journey across a post-apocalyptic land to fight a ritual duel, and fulfill an ancient prophecy. [Between brackets, I add the clocked time of the film's Internet viewing, in the Viooz version, with end credits, and the YouTube version, without; the editing differs a little, especially in the earlier scenes.](00:00) Production presenters titles.(00:20) The Morrighan (Alison Jones), Celtic goddess of war, introduces us to the time and place: a post-apocalyptic world in which the survivors live in two small villages, mostly like in Medieval times. Once in every generation two warriors must be found to fight a sacred duel and fulfill an ancient prophecy.In times of need, one chosen fighter from each village must travel on a quest across treacherous terrain to a sacred circle formed of ancient stones, to fight a ritual sword duel, each armed with a sacred sword. If the two warriors are of equal skill and wield the sister swords, ""Opener"" and ""Dragon Singer"", they will fulfill the Prophecy, and lead the fight against the Falonex Empire. [The Morrighan's speech is mostly covered by the background music.] The goddess intones well her last sentence, ""that time has come!""(02:12; 02:00 YT) Boudiccu (pronounced Boudissu, played by Cecily Fay, an Amazon 4'8"" tall whom all males look down at in admiration) is taking a bath in her birthday suit (the actress was 32 at the time of filming) in the waterfall. She has to abbreviate her bath, and hastily dress in her mini blue tunic, because she hears her sister Morwenna's (Merrilees Fay, actually Cecily Fay's sister) shrilly scream for help. Morwenna is running through the forest, hunted by 5 thugs.Morwenna is tackled down and the ruffians gang on her, intent on raping her. But Boudiccu arrives in time and starts punching and kicking them, despite they're all taller and heavier than her. She breaks the necks of the first two; the third, a bald head black-man, she sends down with an uppercut and a knee to the groin; taking a knife from the fourth man, she cuts off his right ear; again, disarming the fifth man, she wounds him with his own axe; the black-man attacks her again, only to have his neck broken. Seeing the man running away without his ear, Boudiccu's does a somersault, grabs the knife from the ground and does an expert throw, cutting the man's run short.(04:30; 03:53 YT) Opening credits.(05:15; 04:33 YT) Boudiccu accompanies her sister back home, where the Danan Sidhe Fighters are getting ready for their tests. Finvarrah (Christian Howard) is a young man who looks up (pun intended) at Boudiccu, and asks her: ""What happened?"" She answers, ""The Raiders"", and that is explanation enough...Malik (Ryan Stuart) arrives on horseback, and brings bad news to the Danan Sidhe people: his village, Ragganwold, is gone, after a raid by the Falonex soldiers, who made a number of slaves.(06:15; 05:26 YT) Alone with Boudiccu, he warns her not to enter the tests against him, speaks derisively of her taking ethics too high, and states that he is undefeated. ""You may be undefeated, but you have not fought me yet,"" she answers unimpressed.Finvarrah talks sweetly with Boudiccu during the night fire, and is worried by Malik saying that he will stop at nothing to win... Also, he is worried that if Boudiccu wins after all, she'll have to leave the tribe - and they will be set apart.(08:17; 07:00 YT) Danan Sidhe Guru (Loveday Holly) presides the hand-to-hand fights, five man-to-man and five man-to-woman . All fights are very quick, the men topless, the women lightly clad.Of the four male fights, one is Finvarrah winning fair and square against the hefty tattooed Danan Sidhe Bully (Greg Burridge), and the other is Finvarrah losing to the unfair tactics of Malik, who had warned that after winning, ""I'll have your woman!""The five mixed fights are won successively by Boudiccu and a Redhead (Angelina Treva Riley); two Blondes (Sarah-Jane Honeywell, Tanya Belle-Kearns) are credited but do not appear on the final cut. The fights are shown interspersed with scenes of another test - walking up trees to retrieve cloth ribbons tied on the upper trunks - and a single dagger duel at a campfire, between Boudiccu and a man.(11:10; 09:30 YT) The last mixed fight is Boudiccu vs Malik, and the girl is wise to his foul tactics and beats him. She demands, ""Yield!"" and he does so reluctantly, as the repeated demand is in such a tone that he knew she would break his back if he didn't.At the campfire, the Guru announces: ""The tests of strength, speed, and endurance are over. Boudiccu is the undisputed winner of the trials, and will be our champion. (Then, addressing the girl,) You've earned the honor of bearing the sister swords, the Opener and the Dragon Singer...""She shall cross the moors and go to the sacred circle to fight the champion of the northern tribes to the death. ""However, if by the end of the day there is no winner, that will prove that you're two equal warriors to fulfill the prophecy."" Then, she sends Boudiccu away with the blessing of the Danan Sidhe.(13:00; 11:10 YT) The Morrighan appears suddenly out of the darkness, and addresses the people in awe; then she imposes her hands to Boudiccu's head, and says, ""The wilderness is within you... You'll be the last!...""Budiccu dares to address the goddess, who is already leaving: ""The last!... But that'll mean I'll not fulfill the prophecy!...""""The wilderness is your gift. Embrace it, let if flow through you... or it'll drag you into the dark!""(14:34; 12:27 YT) The Falonex Emperor (Will Brenton) has a conversation with Valexia (Penni Tovey), a blonde who seems to be his best aid. She tells him that taking the swords from the rebellious people, will leave them without the source of their faith, and faith is the only thing they have. Valexia takes leave to go on the mission with other Assassins to rob the swords.(15:32; 13:18 YT) Next morning, Bouddicu says her good-byes to the Guru, her sister, and Finvarrah, who hugs her dearly, then gives her a chaste kiss on the lips.(16:23; 14:00 YT) Meanwhile, in a tavern far from the Danan Sidhe fields, a pretty but strong looking blonde, White Arrow (Joelle Simpson) is being accosted by two Drunkards (Justin Gibson and Barry McGinley).She out-drinks them, and leaves when the tavern has no more than another Tavern Customer (Aslom Ullah) with a little beard, asleep at the end of the room. She goes through the men's belongings, emptying their pockets of money and valuables.(17:55; 15:20 YT) Boudiccu walks through the forest, and starts feeling uneasy as she feels the sensation she's being followed. Then, a white arrow plunges in a nearby trunk. Boudiccu turns and sees Valexia and her four Falonex Assassins: Djhan (Helen Bailey) in the central position and an attitude of command, with her hair falling over her right eye; Valexia and another with red shawls over their leather tunics, and two in plain sleeveless, black outfits. (None has a bow and arrow.)Assassin 1 (Zara Phythian) and Assassin 3 (Lora Dunning) are the first to attack and are both beaten in hand-to-hand combat. Djhan throws them weapons for a second try: they are both disarmed and killed with their own weapons.The other three walk together versus Boudiccu, but neither their kick-boxing nor Valexia's long pole save them from being grounded one after the other.(19:10) Boudiccu walks away holding a sword and is charged by Valexia with her long pole; swiftly she turns away, wrenches the weapon from her, trips Valexia, hits her on the belly with half of her own staff. Falonex Assassin 2 (Diana J. Sigston), the long hair brunette, and Djhan attack again with bare hands, and are again beaten down with the long staff. Boudiccu is not making use of her sword, yet.Assassin 2 stands up menacingly, with a mace at the end of a metal chain she whirls about. Budiccu manages to stay away from the encircling, trapping weapon for a while, but then, she loses her sword, wrenched from her hand by the chain. Now it's long pole versus metal chain, and when it seems that Boudiccu has been trapped and forced against her opponent, she manages to grab the chain and pass it round Assassin 2's neck, and strangle her from behind, to the death.She tells the two survivors, Alexia and Djhan, ""You're disgraced. Leave this place!"" They stand up quietly and obey, leaving behind the bodies of their companions.(20:30; 17:27 YT) Boudiccu continues her journey. In a flashback, Boudiccu recalls a conversation with the Danan Guru in which she is told that ""the prophecy may be more than we know"" because ""the prophecy is incomplete... the Elders translated all they could but there are... substantial gaps"".Yet, the Guru refutes that the prophecy is a lie, and adds more mystery and faith to the matter, convincing Boudiccu to take the tribe's faith as her own.(22:00) Falonex Messenger (Simon Feilder) stutters, which does not help him deliver the bad news to the Emperor... He says that the Raiders' attack on the village met with fierce resistance (that being the earlier scene), but the Djhan and her Assassins are devising a new strategy.(22:34) Three Raiders in the forest are about to be robbed by White Arrow (Joelle Simpson), but one of them, a man, sees her. She knocks him out.The others are Female Raiders (Tracey Carron? Jennie Flader?), and they attack her with long poles, but White Arrow prevails again. She takes a purse, and goes her way. (Three other women are credited as Raiders, but they don't seem to have taken part in the final edit: Danielle Minns, Nina Silvert, Loveday Holly.)(24:45) And Boudiccu's journey continues, until night falls. In a dream, we see Finvarrah making love to the female champion and she riding him until they both fall asleep satiated.(27:10) White Arrow comes across the remains of the village that was razed and set afire by the Falonex army. In a flashback, Tetherin (Brendan Carr), with his trade mark biker glasses on his forehead, leads the operation... Picking up some trinkets from the ground, she seems to guess how Tetherin rounded up a number of Ragganwold girls and made them slaves (Annie Innes, Kathleen Innes, Pam Innes, Hannah Lucas, Lauren Lucas, Linneke Sprinks), then harassed her own sister, Silver Rain (Jennie Flader).(28:50) Days pass, in a arduous journey and sparse food. Then, Boudiccu's finds another person hiding from her behind some rocks - but it's Morwenna, who's came from their village because she stubbornly insists in helping her sister along the way, though she accepts that for the sacred duel it'll be up to Boudiccu alone.Finvarrah has come with her, and his kiss also convinces Boudiccu to accept their company in the next - and most dangerous - part of the way.(31:30) They happen upon an abandoned tower, and Finvarrah says those towers are the towers of the dead, ""No one who enters them ever leaves."" This said, looking across at the pacific Atlantic Ocean, he and Boudiccu do not find Morwenna behind them. Obviously the girl has gone inside the building, and they've got to go after her. They find nothing interesting except: a couple of swastika symbols on the wall; and banners with the F of the Falonex Empire (""A dark empire is rising that seeks to destroy us,"" as the Guru said earlier).At least, a book is found, and Boudiccu sends Finvarrah back with it, for the Elders to decipher. A magnifying glass in a box she keeps with her, just in case.(37:40) ""We've made much progress today,"" exclaims Morwenna. Then she falls dead in Boudiccu's arms, hit with precision with an arrow to her back. Valexia is smiling an evil smile for a job well done, holding her long bow atop her brown stallion and surrounded by Falcon Soldiers in heavy leather uniforms and metal helmets.Boudiccu takes the arrow off her dead sister's back, and her hand is immediately awash in blood. She engages and kills swiftly four soldiers without Valexia loosing her evil grin.When she's dispatching another half a dozen of her soldiers, does Valexia stop smiling; her expression is now one of rage.Djhan escapes on horseback. Valexia dares step down from her white horse, and seems very menacing with her expert handling of a sword, but Boudiccu clobbers her head with a mace of arms with which she had finished the last of the male soldiers, and she too dies at Boudiccu's hands.(39:20) Boudiccu swiftly mount's Pelle, Valexia's black stallion, and gives chase to the fugitive amazon. After a chase through the thick forest, Boudiccu stops, as she sees the horse of the fugitive tied to a tree.""Pathetic!"" says Djhan. ""Just like a man..."" She keeps her game of cat and mouse, escaping and hiding - then tripping the running heroine. Follows a long, bone crunching fight on a grassy knoll overlooking the ocean. A punch makes Djhan bleed. When Boudiccu attempts her often applied neck breaker scissors, Djhan bites her leg and she let's go.More roundhouse kicks and punch exchanges, until Boudiccu takes a kick to her face that makes her nose bleed, too. Boudiccu in a rage delivers two unstoppable kicks to the belly, then a punch and Djhan is knocked out... or so it seems. The best of Falonex's assassins trips Boudiccu, who hits her forehead on a piece of rock.Djhan is upon her in a moment, and bangs her head on it a couple of times - leaving the Danan girl out cold. Djhan walks away, possibly to get at the horses, and Boudiccu surprises her, running and screaming at her.The surprise effect is lost, Djhan turns around, holding Boudiccu's foot and making her fall - only to be kicked down herself by a swirling move of Boudiccu's leg. From the ground, feigning to be dizzy, Djhan throws a four point's star that wounds Boudiccu above her right thigh.Then Djhan runs at Boudiccu and kicks her in the belly, sending the Danan champion hurtling back and over the rocky cost. Djhan looks down to make sure her foe is well buried in the ocean.(42:35) For some reason, only now does Tetherin arrive with his bunch of female slaves to a sort of WW2 outpost. Hiding in the bushes, White Arrow waits for an opportunity to strike.(43:30) Everything that goes into the ocean, the ocean gives back. Boudiccu's necklace with amazonite stones is the first to come ashore... but not far away is Boudiccu herself, bruised and badly battered by the fight and the fall.The courageous warrior has to drag herself up the rock escarpment, then she vents her anger in another deep cry to the wind, and finally she returns to bury her sister, digging a burial site with her bare hands. Then she places a broken tree branch on the tomb, which looks like the inverted peace sign of the 1950s.(45:50) Gravin (Keith Eyles) the scientist, presents himself to the Emperor; he is forced to say that he will make his experiment work to destroy the Falonex enemies, though he started by saying that the six months he has been working on it were not enough due to lack of resources.(46:40) Cameron (Aiden Cook) and Clegg (Josh Elwell) [in the screenplay better described as Scavenger #1 and #2] come upon the tomb of Morwenna and their greed is awakened by a piece of jewelry hanging on it. They make immediate plans to sell it as gold to someone they can deceive.They are surprised, and knocked down by White Arrow with her long pole. ""I think I'll take that,"" says the blonde, picking the filigree necklace. The two men run away, shouting vain menaces. ""Some people have no respect..."" says the blonde to herself, as she replaces the necklace on the tree trunk.Boudiccu had been hidden on the look-out, and now she shows herself, asking why the blonde did not keep the necklace. White Arrow says that she is a Raganwold woman, seems to be sorry for Boudiccu's loss of a friend, and then guesses that the Danan girl is on the quest for an equal warrior.(49:30) Boudiccu: ""Get out of here before I add your blood to the blood soaked ground!""White Arrow: ""I'm not going anywhere. It's a free country... for the moment.""White Arrow makes her camp right there, drinks some wine, offers bread to Boudiccu, who rejects it, and then they discuss matters of faith and fighting.Boudiccu tells that the Assassins have robbed her swords, but she seems not to think the old faith is so important, while White Arrow interprets it differently: the fighting is essential to keep one's freedom. Boudiccu goes up to where Valexia lies dead, strips the body of the outer cloths and drapes herself in them.She returns to White Arrow and says, ""She was more than my friend, she was my sister; and she fought for faith and freedom!"" Retorts the blonde: ""And what do you fight for?"" ""I fight for revenge!""The blonde puts an end to their rest: ""Revenge is not for me. Let's go!"" Reluctantly, Boudiccu accepts her company, and White Arrow tells her how she followed her sister to the Falonex headquarters, so that she may be a valuable guide.(54:35) Next, the two women arrive at the Falonex fortress, and spy on it's strong walls. White Arrow says that the Slaves are there, and alive, as the cells have a window that can be seen from outside.White Arrow says that they need a plan, and Boudiccu answers that ""This is the plan!"" as she charges at the fortress, wielding her sword high and shouting.White Arrow has no choice but to shoot her arrows with deadly precision at 2 men. Meanwhile, Boudiccu engages another man in a sword duel; it takes a while, and a second Soldier comes charging at the girl's back, holding his sword with both hands, like a spear to run her through. The girl does a somersault so that he runs through his comrade with his sword, and Boudiccu falls seated on the second attacker's shoulders, breaking his neck with her hands.White Arrow wants to take down a young man [Ramanan (Jason Beeston)?] that is side-by-side with Tetherin on the highest rampart of the fortress, but he's too quick, turns slightly aside and sneers back at her, having caught her feathered arrow in his left fist. Tetherin roars out, and a number of uniformed soldiers appear on the top of the other walls.The two women smile at each other, accepting their fate. By long range kicks or swordplay, Boudiccu downs three men.White Arrow has set down her favorite weapon and engages a Female Soldier (Katerina Sian Milne?) with a long pole, clobbering her to death. Boudiccu seems unstoppable, as she runs through the ramparts impaling half a dozen more soldiers with her sword. (One of them is wearing an incongruous gas mask.)(56:00) White Arrow throws a knife up into her sister's cell. Just in time, as Tetherin has just decided to pay the slaves a visit.(57:00) Boudiccu with a sword finds herself against a female soldier with two Malay daggers (Bettie Nichols?). After a brief sparring, the female soldier takes one of those devastating high-kicks to her head, and falls aside, further hitting her head on the corner of the wall's parapet - presumably dead by concussion.White Arrow arrives at the top of the tower with her long pole, and even without looking at him, pole axes a raider who's sent flying back and over the parapet to a nasty fall (off camera). Boudiccu is hunting Tetherin in the tower's narrow passages, but he's waiting for her, laughing out loud.Meanwhile, Silver Rain is trying to cut the ropes that tie her wrists, using the dagger that her sister had thrown into her cell.In the dark passages to the dungeon, Tetherin attacks the sword armed Boudiccu, while upstairs the Young Man armed with a war-mace fights White Arrow with her long pole. Tetherin, laughing maddeningly all the time, seems to run away, only to confront Boudiccu with a complex multi-blade weapon. She only gets from her difficult position, when pressed against the wall, by kicking him between the open legs.Tetherin let's fall his weapon and his laughing, and takes a moment before running after Budiccu.(59:30) They arrive close one after the other at the top of the tower, just as the Young Man has downed White Arrow with a mace blow. Bouddicu's interference gives the blonde fighter enough time to recover, and when the Young Man comes closer to finish her, the blonde surprises him by plunging the arrow he had caught earlier in his hand, into his neck, killing him.Meanwhile, Boudiccu takes the better of Tetherin, her kicks and throws a plus in her sparring, and puts her sword to his throat. ""Where's the key?"" asks White Arrow. He laughs and is going to say that he doesn't know, but Boudiccu cuts his throat half sentence.With a smile, she says to her blonde companion: ""This is the key,"" showing her sword. Jumping in the air with her sword high, Boudiccu throws herself against the heavy metal chains and padlocks of the slaves' cell block. Her mighty blow of the sword is enough to break the chains.White Arrow sends her sister with the other girls back to their village, but refuses to go with them, because there is something she must do before.(61:15) White Arrow again takes down two uniformed soldiers guarding another town, in a repeat of her fine shooting at the previous compound. Boudiccu tells her to wait there, because ""This is my fight.""Djhan perceived they were under attack, and hides the sacred swords in a crevice of the wall [in plain view from outside]. She meets Boudiccu and they have a long sword fight. For a moment, Boudiccu is disarmed, and uses her hand-to-hand techniques - namely a knee to the belly - to disarm and throw her opponent.Both women retake their swords and run after each other through the corridors of this second tower, and then on top of the tower, a sort of circular arena. Djhan disarms Boudiccu again and walks confidently towards her.She delivers a mighty swipe but instead of backing away from her, Boudiccu closes in with her foe, side-stepping enough, but guts her with a small blade she had hidden in her fist. Djhan falls dead, surprise in her eyes wide-open.Finally the brunette heroine gets hold of the two sword sisters that had been robbed from her... and marches to the place of the sacred duel.(65:00) White Arrow is sitting in front of the ocean, waiting for her, and offers to accompany her, as she is also journeying the same way.The Messenger informs the Emperor that she [meaning Djhan] had failed, and strangely, it does not upset the dictator. For he too, has a faith: that a New Age has come in which the others' beliefs will not matter. He orders his generals to wipe out all the primitives, once and for all. Meanwhile, the two women camp for the night, and get to know each other better.Next morning, Boudiccu makes use of the magnifying glass she brought from the ""tower of the dead"" to see in the distance a troupe of uniformed soldiers coming in their direction. Boudiccu promises White Arrow: ""A different death for each of them,"" which may seem difficult as they're about a dozen following the Falonex Commander (Charles Ramsay).One dies with a sword thrust, one by an arrow shot by White Arrow; another is garroted by Boudiccu's red scarf; four are killed with punches to the heart and head bashed with a lost metal helmet; the blonde kills another by strangling him with a long whip; another drowns after falling into the water because the hidden Boudiccu cut his Achilles tendons with her sharp dagger; another has his neck broken by Boudiccu's leg scissors...When both women join again in a lawn, the last half dozen soldiers die in the midst of more bone breaking, except two who die by the dagger.(72:15) The Commander finds that he has no more army, and is upset. He is a giant of a man, but between the two, the women also defeat him, and it's up to Boudiccu to finish him with a back-breaker.(73:10) While watching her face on a pond, Boudiccu has another vision of the Morrighan.Boudiccu and White Arrow join again, and during the journey they get more and more into each others culture and faith. So that at one point, White Arrow asks from Boudiccu, ""If I do not survive, will you go my village and teach them your ways?"" Boudiccu doesn't want to ear of it, but ends by promising it.Some time later, ""Friend, warrior sister! There's something I must tell you!""

Madras Cafe,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2855648/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An Indian intelligence agent journeys to a war-torn coastal island to break a resolute rebel group and meets a passionate journalist. An Indian Intelligence agent (portrayed by John Abraham)[9] journeys into a war torn coastal island, to break a resolute rebel group. He deftly maneuvers his resources to make significant breakthroughs, amidst a scenario where the enemy has no face and the only counsel is 'Don't get caught.' At various junctions, he meets a charismatic and passionate journalist (portrayed by Nargis Fakhri) who is following her will to reflect the truth behind the civil war. The story unfolds as their quest for the truth reveals a deeper conspiracy, by a faceless enemy, united to seize a common nemesis - India.—Anonymous From time to time there comes a product that you have to sit up and take notice just because somebody even attempted it. Madras Café, with all its flaws, is one such movie. Ours has been a nation obsessed with Gods and saviors. Even more than the Jews, we Indians have always been looking for a savior to rescue us from the mire that is our lives. Our mythological stories are full of Gods to took human form to save mankind and our recent history is filled with people who are considered demi-Gods by their supporters. From Gandhi to Mamata, our leaders always evoke one of two reactions - total and unquestioned loyalty or complete and utter dismissal.In such an environment, Madras Café tries to tell the story of, arguably, the most important political event of our times. The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, without a doubt, changed the face of Indian politics. Shoojit Sarkar and John Abraham, producer, have to be commended for trying to tell an unbiased story on how Rajiv Gandhi came to be assassinated in a most gruesome manner.The movie traces the story from the point of view of Bikram Singh, a RAW agent, who works undercover in Sri Lanka to undermine LTTE chief Prabhakaran and help get the peace process on track. Along the way, he is double crossed, kidnapped, lied to and loses the most cherished parts of his life. Unfortunately, John Abraham the actor does not live up to John Abraham the producer. Johns limited acting abilities mean that we are left feeling cold and unattached to the main protagonist. This is not the first time John has essayed a promising role in the most lifeless manner possible (check out No Smoking or Shootout at Wadala).The movie is filled with bad actors essaying promising roles or good actors essaying one-dimensional roles. For all the effort, Shoojit Sarkar fails to recreate the magic of Vicky Donor. He is let down by the script and the acting skills at his disposal.But it is not all gloomy. Instead there is a lot to recommend about the movie. For one, the photography is top-class. Shot mostly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Kamaljeet Negi does a fine job of capturing the beauty and horror that must have been Sri Lanka in the Prabhakaran era. The music by Shantanu Moitra is complementary without being intrusive to the storytelling.Then there is the fact that this movie was actually made. This is a moment when you have to put aside your demand for the perfect movie and watch Madras Café just so you can tell Bollywood that youd prefer this brand of cinema to the Khans brand. What John Abraham needs is to build a team of good technicians and actors. If he can continue to support and make money from the kind of cinema he believes in, it would be a turning point for Bollywood.Verdict: Must watch"

The unluckiest boy must parse the mysteries of free will in order to pursue his forbidden love of the luckiest girl. Imagine that your destiny and ability to succeed in life is actually determined by a certain personal frequency that can never be changed. Imagine also that there was a definite way of determining that frequency at a very young age, thus sealing your fate forever as either a success or a failure.During testing, little Marie (Eleanor Wyld) is discovered to have an impossibly high frequency, making her the luckiest girl in the world. At the same testing, Zak (Daniel Fraser) is discovered to have a frequency so low, it measures as a negative number.Zak feels a certain connection to Marie, and subsequently falls in love with her, while Marie, besides being very curious about Zak and being interested in the results of an ultra high and ultra low frequency interaction, does not have any feelings for him whatsoever. In fact, due to the ""side effect"" of a high frequency, she has no emotional feelings at all. ""The higher someone's frequency, the less capable they are of appreciating it."" But, nonetheless, she initiates a series of experiments, though they never last beyond one minute without something bad happening to Zak.Therefore, Zak is desperate to raise his frequency so as to be with Marie, who is herself also earnestly desiring to experience emotion, both of which are considered complete impossibilities. But Zak is determined to find a way. With the help of his higher frequencied friend, Theo (Owen Pugh), he devotes his life to cracking this mystery.After many years, they finally make an immense breakthrough, managing to raise Zak's frequency, at least for short periods at a time. He can finally spend more than a minute with his beloved Marie, as well as offer her the chance to at last be able to feel empathy and emotion. With a touch, a kiss, and some prolonged exposure, the experiment is a success. Not only can Marie feel emotion, but for the first time in her life she is truly happy... and in love, with the man who has always loved her.When she brings him home to her parents, though her mother is skeptical, her father is bursting with joy, not only that his daughter is finally happy, but with the excitement of this new invention that is poised to change the world, level the playing field, and even bring an end to war and poverty! But upon further investigation, it turns out this device is not only a frequency balancer, but is in fact capable of mind control. This comes as a shock, not only to Marie and her parents, but even more so to Zak. As a result, everyone turns on him, especially his beloved Marie, who feels that he has in fact brainwashed her to love him.How will he explain? Will Marie and her family ever forgive him? Will Marie ever love him genuinely?"

Russell is still going on dates with girls, while Kevin will do anything to prevent his football teammates from finding out what he is concealing, Min and Terese tell everyone they're really just good friends, and Ike can't figure out who he is or what he wants to be.

Keven eventually makes it clear to Russell that he does want to have relationship with him, only on the understanding that they do remain in the closet. Kevin's own want to be in the closet is despite Russell learning that Kevin's parents would probably be supportive if they knew Kevin was gay, unlike Russell's father. Russell and Kevin believe they are being blackmailed by Min, a fellow student, when she catches them in an embrace.

The Geography Club goes through growing pains of its own, with the two main issues being if they will be all inclusive, adding the most marginalized students in the school, and if they should make the Club official, meaning that all its members would be outed. The latter would have a direct affect on what happens in Russell and Kevin's relationship.—Huggo"

When Linda dates Arthur, the touching truth about her is disclosed.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Emanuel is a 17-year-old young woman who is still wracked with guilt over her late mother who died giving birth to her. She meets a boy on the train on her way to her job at a medical supply shop named Claude, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Emanuel is also living at her small home in Los Angeles with her father, Dennis, and her stepmother Janice, to whom she is anti-social with because she isn't anything like her mother and tries to accuse her of thinking she is a lesbian, as per her name being Emanuel, as her parents believed she were going to be a boy, as a way to justify her bitterness to her step mother.The following night, a woman named Linda moves into the neighborhood as Emanuel's new next door neighbor and she is shocked when she notices she looked just like her late mother. When Emanuel discovers that she is in need of babysitter for her newborn baby, Emanuel (despite her disliking of children) agrees, claiming she'll need the extra money for her ""souvenir collection"" but it's only because she wants to get to know more about the woman who looks like her dead mother. When Linda agrees to allow Emanuel to babysit her child, her interests are shattered when she discovered that the ""baby"" is actually a doll, and Emanuel believes Linda is mentally disturbed. But as Linda and Emanuel develop a close friendship, Emanuel tries to hide the fact that Linda's ""baby"" is really a doll from others by not letting people near the ""baby."" But that task becomes increasingly harder when her best friend/co-worker Arthur from the medical supply store befriends Linda when she goes in to purchase a baby nasal aspirator, and agrees to substitute for Emanuel as the babysitter when Linda makes mention of being invited to Emanuel's 18th birthday dinner and needing a substitute babysitter the night of the dinner.That evening, Linda arrives at Emanuel's house, and Claude also arrives having received an invite. Before the dinner, Dennis tells the guests the story of Emanuel's birth and her mother's death. This is something Emanuel makes her father do every year on her birthday, and she corrects his telling of the story several times. In the kitchen, while cleaning up the dishes, Janice explains to Linda that Emanuel is troubled and might be misinterpreting Linda's fondness for her (thinking that Emanuel has lesbian tendencies towards Linda). When saying goodnight to Claude, after the birthday dinner, Emanuel treats him rather harshly when he brings up that he's agreed to landscape for Linda. Emanuel thinks that he's following her everywhere because they met on the bus, he has been to her home a couple of times, and now he would be around while working for Linda. Claude tells Emanuel that she won't have to see him anymore and leaves.Emanuel agrees to babysit when Linda goes on a date with Arthur. When Arthur and Linda return from the date, Linda suggests that Arthur go upstairs with her to see the baby, who Emanuel says is sleeping. Emanuel begs for Arthur not to go upstairs to see the baby but after Linda calls him up again, he heads upstairs and realizes right away that the baby is not real. Linda seems to finally realize that ""Chloe"" is a doll and begins to panic about where her baby is. Assuming that Emanuel must have replaced Linda's real baby with a phony one, they call Emanuel several times and ask her where Chloe is. After she tells them Chloe is in her crib, Arthur shows her that the Chloe that is in the crib is a doll, not a real baby, and demands to know where Linda's baby is. While Linda yells and threatens to call the police, Emanuel begins to have an emotional meltdown and takes the doll, resulting in her fainting. As she faints, she has a vision in which she holds tightly onto Chloe while water floods into the room.Emanuel swims out of a window in the room into a deep body of water, still holding the Chloe doll. Emanuel swims for a bit and then sees her dead mother swimming a short distance away. The Chloe doll springs to life and swims to Emanuel's mother, who embraces the baby and swims away. Confused, Emanuel hears her name being called and swims away until she awakens on a gurney with her father and a police officer present. She is then taken to the hospital. When the officer asks Emanuel about the circumstances regarding the baby's disappearance, she claims the baby got away from her in the water and went to Emanuel's mom and that they both swam away.Once out of the hospital, Emanuel visits Claude at his job and makes up with him.Meanwhile, Linda's estranged husband is found, and he comes to town and explains to Emanuel and her parents that after spending a lot of money and time trying to conceive, they finally had a baby. The baby died after a few weeks, and with the autopsy results being inconclusive, no one knew what happened, but Linda blamed herself. After the funeral, which Linda would not attend, she began using a doll to replace her dead baby. When her husband tried to have her institutionalized, she disappeared with the doll, and he filed a missing person's report. Now that Linda has been found, she is being held in a psychiatric hospital, where she can only be visited by family. Her prognosis is not good.Emanuel later asks her father for permission to go see Linda, but only for him to harshly tell her to end her obsession with Linda because she nothing like her mother.Going against her father's bitter advice, Emanuel breaks into Linda's house and steals the doll. She then, with Claude's help, sneaks into the psychiatric hospital where Linda is being held and sneaks into Linda's room, where she tells her that her baby died from drowning, as Emanuel saw in her vision. When Linda asks Emanuel what really happened to her baby, Emanuel describes the vision omitting the part about her own mom, as a way to explain Chloe's death. Emanuel then sneaks Linda out of the hospital and brings her to the cemetery where her (Emanuel's) mother had been buried. Because of how ironic it is that Linda's daughter is dead, and physically never was alive, and that Emanuel's mother died giving birth to her, Emanuel tearfully digs a makeshift grave over her mother's tomb and buries the Chloe doll in it. The movie ends with the two women laying in the dirt, watching the stars in the night sky."

Trapped in the wilderness with no communication to the outside world, Henry finds himself face to face with Clay, a man with a personal vendetta against Henry who has returned for retribution. Now, the two mortal enemies must make a choice: put aside their past and work together, or die alone at the hands of the drug runners, a ruthless gang who will stop at nothing to retrieve their lost cargo.—IM Global In the NE United States, near the border with Canada, a small plane flies low over a lake, suddenly goes straight up, the engine stalls, and the plane nosedives and crashes and sinks.At the nearby King's Island is a one-man Forest Ranger station and tourist visitation center. Forest ranger Henry Taylor (Tom Everett Scott) is the one-man. He continually reminds visitors that there's no cell phone reception on the island and the rules include all visitors must leave by dark, leave no trash, and there is to be no drinking while on the island.As Henry works during that day, he is being observed by a man through a pair of rangefinder binoculars.Henry is one of only two people who live on the island. The other is an old man named Sanderson (Christopher Robbie). Henry goes to check on Sanderson now and again, but his visits and concern are unwelcome.
At a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) station in Baring, Maine, the officers on duty were in the process of trying to determine what happened to the small plane that went down. The correctly surmised that a small plane with it's transponder turned off and flying too low for radar was probably up to no good. The officer in charge decided that the agents would need to patrol the waterways to intercept whomever might be coming for or taking away whatever cargo was on the plane.There's a knock on the door of the ICE station. A handful of mounted Canadian Mounties had arrived to offer help in finding the small plane, its occupants and cargo. The ICE agents refuse the offer, telling the mounties that the paperwork required wasn't worth it.Xander (Jean-Claude Van Damme) then enters the room, speaking both French and English and not looking much like a Mountie, given that he's wearing odd looking shoes. He closes the door and the ICE agents demand to know what he thinks he's doing. Xander wonders if they think he doesn't look like a real mountie. One agent confrims the doubt. Xander looks down at his shoes then explains that he doesn't wear leather, because he's a Vegan. He then suddenly attacks and kills or disables all the agents at the station, without use of a gun, because he hates guns.The other faux mounties come into the station, one of them announcing that they only have 4 hours before the next shift of agents show up.Henry comes across a backpack sitting on a trail. He calls out and a woman answers. Her leg is trapped inside a hole below some downed logs. He helps her to his cabin. Her name is Kayla (Linzey Cocker).Two other ICE agents, who had been out on an errand, arrive and find the slaughtered agents at the station. They notice the GPS signal flashing on the screen, coming from the downed plane. They decide to go find out what's going on.Kayla flirts with Henry. There's a mutual attraction. Henry offers to take her across the water, back to her cabin. She doesn't want to leave her canoe behind, so he escorts her down to her canoe. She gives him her name, phone and address and invites him to come across the lake for dinner that night at 9 p.m. He agrees.Xander and his four men go down to the dock, where they see a man, drinking and obviously very drunk. They kill him so they can take possession of his pontoon boat. They dump the man's body in a nearby dumpster.Henry is changing his clothes at his cabin when there's a knock at the door. It's the man who'd been observing him with binoculars throughout the day. The man claimed that he'd beached his boat across the island and noticed the light on at Henry's cabin, so he came there hoping to find help. However, the man was not acting like someone who was tired, worried, or in need of help. For one thing, he slammed the kitchen door behind him as Henry was getting him some water. He also helped himself to an apple and was asking personal questions of Henry. He told Henry that he was unemployed. Henry noticed an odd tattoo on the man's forearm, and right after he told the guy that he was going out for the night, then approached the door, Henry suddenly pulled a knife he had on him and pointed it at the man. The man just as suddenly produced a pistol and pointed it at Henry.The two ICE agents found the body of the murdered boat owner in the dumpster.Henry learns that the man in his cabin is named Clay (Orlando Jones). Clay's younger brother, Decker, was in the Special Forces, under Henry's command in Afghanistan. Decker had been killed in a firefight in Afghanistan, and Clay heard that Decker had been abandoned by his CO. Clay explained that he had made sure to raise his little brother to be the opposite of him and their father, to excel at everything so he could get out and make a better life for himself. Clay wanted revenge for his brother's dying, and he was blaming Henry.Henry said the command sent them in on bad intelligence, that it wasn't anyone's fault. As CO, he couldn't risk losing more men by sending them after Decker, who'd gotten separated from the unit.The phone rang. It was Kayla, leaving a message that she was running late. Clay shoots the phone. Henry decides he'd better try to help himself, so he attacks Clay. Clay is very good at hand-to-hand and knocks Henry out.Xander and his henchmen are on the pontoon, planning for a diver will go down and retrieve the heroine that is on the plane.Clay drags Henry out across a field and hands him a pistol. He wants him to shoot himself. If he won't, Clay intends to shoot him. Henry explains that a few years ago, he would have shot himself, gladly, but not now. He's come to realize that it wasn't his fault that Decker had died.Just as Clay is about to shoot Henry, bright lights shine on them. It's Xander and his men on the pontoon boat, wondering who they are and what they are doing. Xander and his men claim to be ICE, but Henry knows better. He rushes forward and pushes Clay to the ground, then runs. Xander's men shoot at them. Clay shoots back hits the diver in the chest.The two ICE agents are out on the water in their boat and they hear the gunfire and head that way.Clay starts chasing after Henry through the trees.When Xander determines that his diver won't survive, he first throws a brief fit, then smothers the man using his hands. Xander knows that Henry is an ex-military diver, so he decides they must go find him and have him retrieve the heroine. They will just kill Clay.Two of Xander's men get to Henry's cabin. No one's home. They find a boat at the dock. Xander tells them over a two-way radio to sink the boat.Henry goes to where he keeps a kayak, but he's intercepted by another Xander's men who shoots a hole in the kayak and captures Henry. Clay shows up and slides a shell into the chamber of his shotgun, distracting Xander's man. Henry knocks the man out, but when he bends over to pick up the man's gun, Clay shoots the gun, ruining it.Henry persuades Clay that even if they remain enemies, they should work together to get through whatever's going on with Xander and his men. Henry has presumed that Xander and his men are mercenaries involved in the drug trade.Henry leads Clay to Sanderson's cabin to see if there's a phone. They now have a walkie talkie and can hear Xander and his men speaking on theirs, but when Xander realizes one of his men may be down, he orders the rest of them to speak only in French.The two ICE policemen are now on land, looking for whomever might be in the woods. Xander ambushes and kills them both with a sharp branch. He then sees a wild strawberry and goes over and eats it, just one of the numerous instances indicating he's either bi-polar or otherwise messed up.Xander calls to Clay and Henry on the walkie-talkie. Henry tells Clay not to answer. Xander encourages them to call whenever they are ready to talk, that he's ""in the book"".Clay and Henry continue on to Sanderson's cabin. Henry climbs in through a window of the dark cabin, followed by Clay. He hits Clay when he's coming through and grabs the gun. He tells Clay to go call the police. The phone is dead. Sanderson then turns on a light. He's holding a rifle and orders Henry to lay his shotgun down.Henry and Clay quickly try to explain to Sanderson what's going on. Sanderson explains to them that he had the phone shut off a couple years prior, but kept the phone because it looked nice.Xander calls them again on the walkie-talkie, wanting Henry to come out and he'd leave the other two alone. Sanderson tells Henry and Clay that he's willing to fight. He turns on a panel of bright exterior lights and fires off a warning round. Xander sends a man around back, then orders his other two men to fire their machine pistols at the cabin.Sanderson tosses Henry a knife, the only other weapon he had available. He orders Henry and Clay to go out the back and get away while he distracted the men outside. Henry refused to leave Sanderson behind. Sanderson then goes out the front door, raises his gun and is immediately shot. Henry starts to go out after him, but Clay tackles and stops him. Henry comments to Clay how it's sometimes necessary to stop others from going into harm's way when it doesn't make sense.Henry and Clay go out the back door, where Henry immediately sees one of Xander's men and uses the last shotgun shell to shoot the man in the shoulder. They then get away.Sanderson is wounded, and spunky to the end. He tells one of Xander's men to kiss his geriatric ass. Xander has his two men stand Sanderson up, then tells Sanderson a story about the pet goose he had as a child. He said his grandmother fed the goose to the family for dinner one night and how he killed her for that. That's also how Xander became a vegan. He then stabs Sanderson in the heart.Clay admits to Henry that he didn't really have a boat. The man who dropped him off at the island was due back the next morning to take him out. Henry wants Clay to hide until morning, while he distracts Xander and his men away from him. Henry has only a knife, length of rope, fishing line, and some matches. He builds a bonfire, which Xander's man, who was back on the pontoon boat, sees. He calls Xander for instructions. Xander tells the guy to beach the boat and help find Henry.Xander calls on the walkie and tells Henry he knows he has a son and will find and kill him if he doesn't come help him.Clay runs back to the unconscious man that Henry had cold-cocked earlier, checking him for more weapons apparently. The man wakes up and grabs Clay. They fight and Clay knocks the guy out with a rock.The man in the boat joins Xander's other two henchmen by the bonfire and start searching for Henry and Clay. One of them runs up against some taut fishing line, which trips a stick, to which Henry's knife was tied and it stabs the man in the throat. A second man falls into a booby trap, running a sharp stick through his lower leg. Henry goes hand-to-hand with the boatman, who gets the better of Henry and is choking him out when Clay arrives and runs a knife through the boatman's neck from behind.Clay and Henry shake hands, deciding to trust one another from then on.They go over and pull the wounded man from the booby trap and tie him to a small tree, then proceed to interrogate him. The man is belligerent and uncooperative. Clay threatens to put out the man's eye if he doesn't tell them what's going on. He tells them about the plane, the heroine, the plan to have Henry dive on the wreck, and how Xander is the only one of them left. Before they leave, Clay knocks the man out.Clay and Henry run to the pontoon. Xander sees them and calls on the walkie-talkie. He offers Henry half a million dollars for 10 minutes work. Henry declines. Xander then puts Kayla on the walkie. She had come back to Henry's place and was taken captive by Xander. Xander threatens to kill her if Henry doesn't come help him.Clay wants to take the boat and get away. Henry reminds him that would be abandoning Kayla, and she's someone who should be helped. Henry drops Clay off before he takes the boat and returns to his cabin. He has one of the thugs machine pistols with him and gets the drop on Xander, but then Xander puts a knife to Kayla's throat. It's a standoff, when the thug they'd left tied to a tree shows up and gets the drop on Henry. Xander and Henry then board the pontoon, leaving the thug and Kayla behind to wait.Clay shows up and sneaks up on the thug and swings at him with a boat paddle. They fight on the pier, falling into the water. Clay takes him out, then goes to untie Kayla. Clay wants her to go for the police, but when he turns away from her, she pulls a gun on him. It turns out that she works with Xander.Clay escapes from Kayla by diving off the pier and swimming away as she shoots at him, but misses. She goes looking for him, but then sees a police boat approaching. She calls Xander on the walkie-talkie for instructions and he tells her to take care of the police.Two policemen approach the dock, saying they had reports of loud noises coming from the island. Clay comes running from hiding, shouting at the cops to shoot Kayla. She instead pulls out her pistol and shoots them. Clay then attacks and knocks Kayla out.Henry dives and retrieves the heroine. He comes back up and tosses the bag onto the boat, then climbs on board and produces a gun he found on the plane. He orders Xander to drive the boat back to the dock.When they arrive back at the dock, Henry sees the dead policemen, then sees Clay holding Kayla prisoner. Kayla starts shouting for Henry to help her. Henry is momentarily confused and hesitates too long. Xander knocks the gun from his hands and they fight, while Kayla disarms Henry and they also fight. The four switch opponents in mid-fight and Henry knocks Kayla down. Just as Xander is about to break Clay's neck, Henry calls out to him, grabs the bag of heroine and runs. Xander drops Clay and takes off after Henry, but first he stops long enough to break Kayla's neck, for screwing up.Xander than pursues Henry up a tree and they fight and fall down to the ground, branch by branch. Xander thinks he has knocked Henry out and takes the heroine and runs to the pontoon. As he's taking off, he sees Henry run and jump into the boat. They fight some more and Xander accidentally punches a hole in the gas tank as he swings the anchor at Henry, but misses.Xander knocks Henry over board, but not before Henry grabs a flare, which he uses to ignite the trailing plume of gasoline coming from the hole in the tank, exploding the boat and Xander with it. Xander had a big grin on his face as he realized he was about to die.Henry swims back to the shore where Clay helps him, saying ""Not a fuckin' word."" Henry replies, ""My lips are sealed."""

The Last Days,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935914/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 2013, a mysterious epidemic spreads across the planet: humanity develops an irrational fear of open spaces which causes death within seconds. Soon the entire global populace is trapped inside buildings. As Barcelona descends into chaos, Marc sets off on a quest to find Julia, his missing girlfriend--without ever venturing outside. The sun shines among the trees, with a beautiful lady looking back and smiling.In an office building, Marc Delgado (Quim Gutiérrez), stares at the mess. He picks up some food and then looks out of the window, to some burning bridges in downtown Barcelona. Somebody tells him that he needs to go to the basement. There, they are trying to build a tunnel out of the building with inadequate tools. Marc gets so frenzy when he thinks about his girlfriend, that he's about to make everything tumble down. Finally, they reach the next building: it's an empty underground tunnel, but with some lights on. Later on, Marc joins the queue to get some food. There, he notices a man with a GPS in his backpack.The man is Enrique (José Coronado), who tells Marc that they will talk later if he stays silent now.Flashback to the same office building working, with plenty of workers pushing papers. Enrique is nicknamed ""The Terminator"" behind his back, because he's there to fire people. He calls Mark to his office. Mark is a computer engineer who has to design the security protocol of a new product the company are designing. The work is late. Marc says that it's a complex matter, and that if he doesn't his job well and carefully, there'll be trouble for years and years to come. Enrique replies that the company is having problems, that's why he's there. If the company were profitable, he wouldn't have been called on to begin with. Enrique insists that the security protocol must be ready at the end of the month. Marc has to work late at night, but the protocol isn't working. He calls his girlfriend Julia (Marta Etura), who works at a puppet shop in a shiny shopping center. Andrea (Leticia Dolera) tries to convince her to go out and have fun, to no avail. Another mistake in the program.Marc goes home by tube, knackered out. He's about to sleep while standing. Finally, he reaches home. The neighbour opposite home looks at him. Marc arrives home and smiles when he sees Julia painting another puppet. Marc is afraid of losing his job, and that's his reason for not wanting to have a child with Julia. He suffers from insomnia. At 3:30 in the morning, he gets up to watch the news. The Hekla volcano is active, and it's affecting all the airflight in Europe. In a video, Greg Lafferty (Robert Donaldson), a Canadian teenager, says that his father can't believe him that he couldn't leave his room. Dad thought he just hadn't wanted to leave the room for six months. He picks up a gun and commits suicide. Many workers comment on the news. Marc is the only one who has noticed that Perico has not showered or changed his clothes in a while, meaning that he probably got fired.We come back at the present, with mess and litter all over the building. Marc and Enrique talk in private. Marc wants to search for Julia. He threatens Enrique with telling the rest, but he doesn't look impressed. Marc has a torch, some gas, a penknife, all stolen from Rovira (Pere Ventura). At first, Enrique tells him that he's not interested in getting those items from Marc, but he doesn't want anybody to know that he still has the GPS, as those in the mobile phones don't work at all. Now we know that they have been in the building for three months. Enrique accepts the deal.They start their way on the subway, following the typical leaflet with the station map. Lights flicker. A demented man is showing off an alive rat. Onlookers laugh at them when they speed up at the sound of gunshots. They reach a chaotic tube station crammed with people. It looks like the law of the jungle. A young boy steals the GPS from Enrique. He and Marc fun after him. The boy does parkouring, and creates a small fire on his way out.They say goodbye. The brother of the guy doesn't want to return the backpack. Javier (Isak Férriz), an ex-cop, threatens them with a gun. Enrique fights with him while Marc gets the backpack. Enrique kills Javier and gets his gun. The friends of Javi run after Marc - who has finally recovered the backpack - and Enrique. Enrique has hurt his hand. The screen is broken, but it still works. In spite of the gun, Enrique will keep the deal.Back at 7:00,when a radio DJ (Jordi Basté) is making a substitution. Marc leaves for work, and realises something strange at the nosy neighbour's flat. The door is open and he enters. He's kept bags and bags of rubbish in his flat. He chokes on the disgusting stink. The neighbour attacks him with a knife, and admits that he hasn't left the building in months. He feels he can't, and will be thought crazy by anyone he tells him. At the office, two security officers (Xavi Lite and Lolo Herrero) put him out. Rovira has been sleeping for days in the building; he fights not to be pushed out. Rovira dies as soon as he's pushed out. Somebody calls for an ambulance, Marc tells them to pull him inside and Rovira stops convulsing. It's too late: Rovira is dead. Marc looks at Enrique accusingly. Marc looks at Rovira's things, hidden in a cabinet. Back home, Julia hugs Marc in the balcony. They stare at the city. Marc has noticed that there are many closed shops, people who won't go to work. Julia can't understand him. Marc tells her about the death of Rovira in his arm from a heart attack. Marc admits that he didn't really know him either.When he wakes up, Marc thinks that Enrique has left him. Rats are eaten the corpse of a dead man. Enrique won't tell what he wants to do at the Olympic city. He's got some seeds in a bag. They reach a gutter conduct in the subway, which should take them to the sewer system.Outside, animals run wild among the many abandoned cars. The camera pulls down to the sewers, where Marc and Enrique are crawling. They count forty steps, and they think that they are below Marc's building. Enrique shoots the campsite gas to create an explosion. The first time, he fails. The noise deafens them for a while. Enrique can't shoot straight because of his hurt hand. Marc shoots and fails as well, bleeding from the ears. The second time, he succeeds, and everything goes off. Marc looks paralized, but he recovers soon. There are people all over the place in the building. They crack the door open because Julia was not there. A man shouts that she left. There is a family of foreign-looking people (Abdelatif Hwidar the father, Farah Hamed the wife and Lily Morett the daughter). They haven't seen Julia ever. Marc and Enrique look around. The family hunt pigeons. Enrique picks the unexploded seeds from a bag of microwave popcorn. Enrique gets a kitchen knife. Marc sees the horror puppet and realises that Julia was pregnant when he sees the ultrasound scan of the foetus.Back at Marc and Julia watching the news of the first dead people from what it's now called ""The Panic"". A government spokesperson (Francesc Pagès) tells people that they are working on it, and that people should go to work. It's a global epidemic. Julia is angry with him because she thinks that the Panic is just another of his excuses not to marry her and have children with her. Marc goes to work: very few people on the streets and on the underground. Marc is still angry when he arrives to his office. In a TV debate, nobody really knows what they're talking about: aseptic modern life, a biological agent... Andrea tells Marc that Julia doesn't want to speak with him. Marc shouts to her on the phone. Marc wants to leave the building to go and call on Julia, but as soon as he steps out, he gets dizzy and has to go inside fast. He checks it while still on the floor, but his mobile phone doesn't work. He imagines Julia crying, holding the scan picture.It rains outside, and they pick some water, putting it into buckets. Everybody tries to pick the water. The sewer system gets flooded. Everybody fills bottles, pots and pans. Enrique and Marc leave the flat.Enrique calls off their deal: he'd agreed to go with him to that flat. ""This is not a gynkana in which we walk all over Barcelona until we found her."" Enrique says that Julia may be dead, and that the baby may be lost anyway. In the ensuing fight, they lose the torch. Now, we learn that Enrique wants to find his father. Together again, they find a lighter in a church. They start a bonfire. They try to defend themselves from a bear with spikes. Marc hesitates: should he run away or should he help Enrique, who has fallen to the floor and is about to be eaten by the bear. They are trapped, because they are getting closer to the menacing door. The bear gets impalled when it falls on top of Marc. They laugh when they see an id sign from the Barcelona zoo.

However Jill has left her passport in the house of her aunt Gina and they travel in a car with Gina and Jill's boyfriend Ramon to the town where Gina lives. They drive through a shortcut but they are stopped on the road by Capitan Morales that warns them that the road is flooded and is too dangerous to drive along, but Gina decides to continue.

When Felipe returns with David with the wood and learns that the couple left the room, he runs to the box but is subdued by David. Felipe warns that the girl will kill his family, but they believe that the old man is a pedophile. But soon they discover the truth about Ana Maria.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film opens as a distraught man leans against a wooden door in the dark. Something inside growls and relentlessly attempts to force the door open and the man recounts the events leading up to that present moment...The man, photographer named David Reynolds, has come to Colombia with his wife-to-be Lauren to find his daughter Jill and convince her to come back to the United States to attend their wedding. Jill is currently in Bogota staying with her aunt Gina who's a news reporter and has become romantically involved with Gina's cameraman Ramon.When the group meets up at a restaurant in the city, David attempts to convince his daughter to return home for the ceremony - something she's reluctant to do as she resents him getting re-married even years after the death of her mother Marcela. After much convincing, Jill relents but states that she can't go anywhere until they retrieve her passport from Gina's home in a neighboring town.Accompanied by Gina and Ramon, the family set out onto the rural roads of Colombia as a rain storm rolls in. As David and Lauren become more and more concerned with the weather conditions, a police car appears behind them and pulls them over. The officer - Captain Morales - warns of the treacherousness of the way ahead and possibility of flash floods, insisting that they turn around. After telling the officer they will do just that, Gina convinces David to keep going as she knows the roads and assures him that they'll come to a safer main road in just a few miles.As time passes, Lauren starts to become wary of Gina's supposed knowledge of the area and soon the car veers off and becomes stuck in the mud. Before they can get out and push the vehicle back on the road, a wall of water rushes down the mountainside and send the car rolling further down the hillside.Banged up but alive, the group escapes the overturned vehicle and Ramon spots a footpath leading to a large home atop a hill. Frantically knocking on the door, an elderly man appears and tells them that the inn is closed and they should seek shelter elsewhere. David pleads for help for his wounded and stranded family and the old man hesitates before allowing them entry.Taking them into the lobby, the man introduces himself as Felipe and acts suspiciously - telling them he does not have a working phone or cellphone and commanding them to not leave the room under any circumstances. The group patches themselves up and recovers, Lauren (who's a nurse) discovering that she has several broken ribs. When David asks Felipe if he has wood for the fireplace, the old man signals him to follow outside to gather some - again warning the four others to not leave the lobby while he's gone.Ramon and Gina poke around the front desk and make two curious discoveries: a phone whose line has been cut and a ledger that says that the last time a guest stayed at the inn was in the 1970s. When Jill states that she needs to use the bathroom and intends to find one, she ignores Lauren's reminder of what Felipe said, and Gina tells Ramon to accompany her.Venturing upstairs, Jill and Ramon investigate the dilapidated home - coming across a little girl's bedroom which looks like it hadn't been lived in, or touched, for decades. When Jill finally finds a rather disgusting bathroom she goes about her business before hearing strange noises coming up through the pipes leading into the basement. Nearing the source of the noise, it sounds like the whimpers and cries of a small child.Jill and Ramon proceed to try and find the entrance into the basement and help the child as David and Felipe return, the latter instantly noticing that two of the group are missing and tearing off into the house to try and find them.Hearing Felipe fast-approaching, Jill and Ramon duck into a closet and hide - watching the old man enter and scan the room before opening a secret door in the floor and checking down the stairs for anything unusual. David and Gina then enter and convince Felipe to calm down and return to the lobby - assuring him that the two just went to use the bathroom and would reappear shortly.With Felipe gone, Jill and Ramon open the hidden door and venture into the basement - coming across a number of unsettling things including a dark, dingy room where Ramon wonders if it's where Felipe sleeps at night. Jill discovers a large wooden door and sure enough, a child is locked inside. The young girl tells them her name is Ana Maria and that the old man has been keeping her locked away for quite some time. Thinking that Felipe is a child murderer/sexual abuser, Jill attempts to free Ana Maria but before she can the old man appears and holds them at gunpoint - telling them to step away from the door.David suddenly appears and knocks Felipe unconscious with a shovel. Asking what's going on, Jill shows her father the door and the girl trapped within and he proceeds to break off the padlock and free her. Returning upstairs, they inform the rest of the group what they've discovered and leave Ana Maria with Lauren as David ties up Felipe in his office which is covered in notes and drawings appearing to be related to Satanism and witchcraft.When the old man awakens he frantically speaks to David in Spanish and unable to understand him, David calls for Jill. When his daughter arrives and translates what Felipe is saying she tells her father he's saying they're all going to die. Perceiving this to be a threat, David tightens Felipe's restraints and gags him.As Lauren checks the girl for injuries and tries to comfort her, Gina takes advantage of the situation and goes into the basement and takes video recordings of the ""cell"" that Ana Maria was kept inside, discovering numerous symbols etched into the floor, walls, the inside of the door, and ceiling and a skeletal corpse in the corner. When Gina attempts to interview the girl, she's rebuffed by Lauren who tells her to leave the traumatized child alone.While the group attempts to figure out what to do next, Ana Maria sneaks off to confront Felipe. Removing his gag, the girl teases and mocks Felipe about her release and the old man pleads with her to spare the group and take his life instead. As Ana Maria leaves the room Felipe eyes a knife on the desk and begins to loosen his restraints.Back in the lobby, Felipe suddenly appears and screams for forgiveness from God as he lunges towards Ana Maria with the knife. Ramon, who's in possession of the rifle, shoots and kills Felipe before he has a chance to harm anyone. As the group stands around stunned, one notices that the old man sliced his wrists before attacking and question why he would do such a thing.As David puts Felipe's body back in the office, Ramon finds a set of car keys and searches outside for the vehicle. Things begin to take a strange turn when Ana Maria gropes Jill's chest and thighs and tells her she has a ""strong body"" and later a picture from the 1970s is found that shows a girl who looks exactly like the young girl they've rescued.When Gina searches through the kitchen, Ana Maria appears and holds the reporter's phone asking to interview her. Entertaining the girl, Gina light-heartedly agrees but things quickly turn sinister as girl begins questioning her about her boss - revealing that she inexplicably knows about Gina's attraction to him and how after having sex with him she became pregnant and, not wanting to jeopardize her career, got an abortion without telling him. Horrified and confused, Gina collapses as Ana Maria places her hand upon her stomach and something begins to move inside.Elsewhere, Ramon finds Felipe's car but discovers that the engine is missing.When the others search for Gina they come into the kitchen to find her unconscious and laying next to Ana Maria in the pool of blood. When Gina comes to she tries to explain that the young girl committed suicide in front of her for reasons unknown. David wraps the child's body in a sheet and takes her into the office - lying her next to Felipe.Shaken and confused, the group tries to comfort Gina while trying to figure out what to do next. Suddenly there's a knock on the door and when David answers it's revealed to be Captain Morales. Agitated, Morales holds them at gunpoint and demands to see Felipe. When David takes the policeman into the office and shows him the bodies of the old man and Ana Maria, Morales becomes frantic and ignores David's explanation of events - forcing him, Lauren, and Jill into the basement.When Morales attempts to usher them into the ""cell"", David attacks and disarms him. The tables now turned, David demands to know what is going on. Eventually, Morales begins to explain everything. He tells them that the hill where the inn stands was once the site of a gallows and long ago a bruja (witch) was hanged there. The bruja swore revenge on the men who executed her - one of which was an ancestor of Morales - and promised to return to not only kill them but their bloodlines as well.In the 1970s, the bruja terrorized Felipe's family - leading to the death of his wife and the possession of his daughter: Ana Maria. Morales and Felipe worked together to try and discover a way to fight the bruja and in doing so made two discoveries - that the witch knows everyone's deepest, darkest secrets and that she could only possess the bodies of those that killed her current host. Not wanting to kill his own daughter, Felipe instead chose to lock her away, close the inn, and attempt to find a way to rid Ana Maria of the bruja.When Morales conducts a test to see if any of the three are possessed, it's revealed that either Gina or Ramon must be.Elsewhere in the house, Gina corners Ramon and begins to make sexual advances towards him - telling him she knows he's always been attracted to her and wants to have sex with her. When Ramon weakly resists, Gina reveals she knows that Ramon is a con man: that he makes young women fall in love with him and then manipulates them into smuggling drugs inside their bodies across international borders. When Gina mentions that a number had died from doing so, she mockingly asks if that's what his intentions are regarding Jill.When Ramon begins to violently vomit blood, he throws Gina into a staircase and she snaps her neck on a railing. Not dead quite yet, she recovers and pursues Ramon outside onto a balcony where he uses the rifle to shoot and kill Gina before she can attack him.Hearing the gunshot, the group realizes that whomever just killed the other is now possessed by the bruja - discovering it to be Ramon when Morales stops him from driving away in his police vehicle and forcing the witch to retreat and find other means of escape. Morales tells the others to leave and let him handle the bruja as he's the one she is truly after.As Ramon attempts to enter the house and terrorize them all, David, Lauren, and Jill flee and drive away in Morales' car. Their escape is cut short however when Ramon crashes through a window and a struggle ensues inside the vehicle which causes it to veer off the road and stop short of a body of water. Using a pair of handcuffs, Lauren restrains Ramon and the three exit the car only to watch as it slowly rolls into the water.When Ramon begins to laugh maniacally, David realizes that if the bruja drowns and dies Lauren will be possessed next as she was the one who handcuffed him. He dives into the water and frees Ramon, dragging him back on land and performing CPR to avail as Lauren starts to experience pain and has seizures.Returning to the house, David and Morales attempt to restrain Lauren only for her to mortally wound the latter by biting a chunk out of his neck. The bruja escapes their clutches and shares David's secret: that he pulled the plug on Marcela's life support because he wanted her to die faster. Jill is overcome with grief and disbelief and David attempts to explain that he did so because her mother was in a lot of pain and there was no chance of recovery. Jill, still upset, flees.When Lauren disappears into the depths of the house after Jill, a barely alive Morales offers to kill the bruja himself if David can lead her to him - the idea being that if she possess him as he dies of his wounds she will finally be defeated (which is why Felipe slit his wrists earlier in the film before trying to attack Ana Maria). David looks for Jill and engages in a cat-and-mouse game with Lauren before finally luring her into a room where Morales waits behind a door ready to strike.Aware of the trap, Lauren kills Morales before he can make his move and tries to manipulate David into killing her - wanting to possess a healthy body as Lauren's ribs are broken. David resists doing so and instead leads the bruja into the basement in an attempt to lock her back inside the ""cell"". When the bruja changes her form into that of Marcela, David falls to his knees and apologizes to the specter of his late wife. Once more, the bruja tries to get David to kill her and - overcome with emotion - agrees to do so under the promise that she will leave Jill alive. When the bruja agrees, David is about to kill her but Jill appears and does so instead.Realizing the consequences of her actions, Jill tells her father to lock her in the cell before she becomes fully possessed. Sharing one final tearful moment together before the bruja takes over, David slams the door shut it - deciding to do just as Felipe had done in keeping his daughter locked away and attempting to find a means of exorcising the witch."

Twilight chases the pony into a room within the castle, where the culprit is revealed to be a fiery-haired yellow pony. The crown ends up falling into a strange mirror, and the thief follows right afterwards.The next morning, Princess Celestia explains to the others that the culprit was a pony named Sunset Shimmer. Sunset was Celestia's former pupil before Twilight, but due to not getting what she wanted quick enough, she went through the mirror. The mirror had originally been held in Canterlot, but was later transported to the Crystal Empire, where it was put in the care of Princess Cadence.The mirror also operates on a timer, whereby access to the world on the other side, happens once every 30 moons. Currently, the portal only has 3 days left to remain open, and Twilight is entrusted with the task to go through it to reclaim her crown.Naturally, Twilight's friends are eager to assist her, but are told by Celestia that Twilight has to accomplish this task herself. Twilight goes through the mirror, but Spike (in a panic), quickly charges after her.Once on the other side, Spike finds himself as a dog,and Twilight as a teenage human girl. Naturally, Twilight first freaks out at her new appearance, but soon finds herself in front of a large building. Thinking it to be ""a castle,"" she goes inside, and finds herself among a number of other teenagers. After being helped to her feet by a boy with blue hair, she wanders the halls, studying the other teenagers.Suddenly, she hears one girl berating another about taking something, and speaks up, telling the bullying girl to stop what she's doing. The fiery-haired teenager just smugly walks off, claiming she can do whatever she wants.Once the girl is gone, the other introduces herself as Fluttershy, and tells Twilight that the girl she just talked back to was Sunset Shimmer. When Twilight asks what she was talking about, Fluttershy tells how she came across a crown one day. Unsure what to do with it, she turned it in to Principal Celestia.Twilight then goes to the Principal's office, and inquires about the crown. It soon turns out the crown is to be used as the crown for the upcoming Fall Formal in three days. A trio of picture on a nearby wall shows that Sunset Shimmer has won the crown the last 3 years.Though Twilight could probably ask for her crown back, she tells Spike she's mainly fearful that humans might come through the portal to Equestria, looking for it. Wanting to win fair and square, she decides to run for Princess of the Fall Formal.Encountering Fluttershy in the lunch room, Twilight tells her about her plans, and Fluttershy tells Twilight that Sunset is very vindictive of anyone else running against her (including mentioning how she lashed out at a candidate for the Princess of the Spring Fling earlier in the year). Twilight also notes that it seems there are numerous cliques in the lunchroom, and Fluttershy claims that Twilight will need to convince all of them if she is to win the crown.Fluttershy tells Twilight to meet the head of the Party Planning Committee in the gym to sign up for the Fall Formal, and Twilight is surprised to run into Pinkie Pie! She also encounters Applejack, who also cautions Twilight about what she plans to do.After Twilight leaves, Sunset Shimmer (along with Snips and Snails) come to the gym, where she quickly berates all that Pinkie has done. Pinkie then lets slip about Twilight running for the Fall Formal title, and Sunset quickly leaves the gym.Cornering Twilight in a corner of the school, Sunset lets slip that bringing an Element of Harmony into an alternate world can cause things to happen, but upon finding out that Twilight has no idea what they may be, she just berates her and Spike, claiming there's no chance she can win the Fall Formal, as she has no way this alternate world works.Twilight then goes to the library to study, and awkwardly tries to use a computer, carry a large book load, and even work a copy machine. After several hours, the library is set to close, and Spike leads Twilight to an upper floor, where he has a bed for her, made out of books.Twilight shows Spike a yearbook she found, that shows Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Rarity, all posing in a picture as Freshman students. Twilight notices that they seem to be good friends, but wonders why they aren't this way anymore.The next day, Twilight prepares to win over the various students, but is surprised when they all start chuckling/giggling as she walks down the hall. Before she knows it, Twilight is yanked into a side-room by Rarity, before Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy appear.They then show that video was taken of Twilight's mishaps in the library the previous day, and Sunset Shimmer has posted a video (composed of footage shot by her lackeys, Snips and Snails), showing Twilight 'spazzing' out. Humiliated by what's happened, Twilight is unsure what to do.Several of the girls agree to help her, but a verbal fight breaks out, when they all claim that others are not dependable. Such issues include:-Fluttershy saying Pinkie Pie ruined her silent auction with loud noisemakers.-Rarity claims that she volunteers to help the Party Committee, but is always told her help isn't needed.-Applejack tells how Rainbow Dash offered to have the Soccer Team show up at her bake sale, and then didn't appear.As they talk further, they soon find out that:Pinkie received a text from Fluttershy saying she wanted 'a big party,' but Fluttershy claims she didn't send a text like that.Rarity claims that she received an email saying her help wasn't needed, but Pinkie claims she sent no messages.Applejack also finds out that Rainbow Dash received a message that the bake sale's date has been moved.Upon finding this out, the girls all make up, and are now apt to believe that Sunset Shimmer was behind their divisions.Going to a small coffee house afterwards, Twilight runs into a boy she met previously, but Rarity cautions Twilight to not pursue him, as the boy (named Flash Sentry), was previously Sunset Shimmer's boyfriend (up until she broke up with him 2 weeks before).The group attempts to find some way to change the school's thoughts on Twilight, and Rarity suggests they wear some headbands with horse ears, and tie tails around their waists, which were part of a fashion idea she had a few years ago, to support the schools mascot: The Canterlot Wondercolts.At lunch that day, the girls begin to sing a song about helping Twilight Sparkle ""win the crown,"" and the infectious song soon unites the numerous cliques in the lunch room.The next day, Sunset Shimmer reports to Vice-Principal Luna that the gym has been wrecked, and provides photos showing Twilight doing the destruction. Twilight is unsure what to say when called to Luna's office and shown the pictures, but is saved when Flash shows up. He provides some photos that have had Twilight cut out of them, showing that the photos Sunset presented were doctored. Even though Twilight's name is cleared of wrongdoing, Luna informs them that the damage to the gym means the Fall Formal will need to be moved back an extra day.This news causes Twilight to panic, and she rushes out of the school, and into a dress shop where the others are. In a private corner, Twilight frets about what to do: if she stays longer than that evening, the portal will close, and she and Spike will be trapped in this world for another 30 moons.Spike suggests that Twilight confess to the others just what she is, and what is at stake. At first unsure about telling them the truth, everyone is shocked when Pinkie Pie just spouts off everything that Twilight wants to say, claiming she had ""a hunch."" Even though she's a ""pony princess"" from another dimension, the girls are still willing to help her out.Returning to the school, they set out to try and fix the damage to the gym, with several other students quickly pitching in to help. Pretty soon, the gym looks brand-new, and the Fall Formal is set to go on that night.The girls then return to the dress shop, where they prepare for the evening, and then return for the dance.At the reveal of the Fall Formal princess, the girls cheer when Twilight wins! However, Spike's voice rings out, and Twilight sees Snips and Snails running away with him! The girls chase them outside, to find Sunset Shimmer standing by the portal with a sledgehammer, threatening to destroy it, unless Twilight hands over her crown.However, Twilight refuses, claiming that doing so would cause more harm to the beings in this current world. Twilight's friends happily gush over how selfless she is to help them, causing Sunset to snap and jump Twilight, intending to take the crown from her.A gave of keep-away ensues, with Sunset eventually getting the crown. However, upon putting it on her head, it turns her into a red-skinned, demon-looking entity. She then turns Snips and Snails into the same, and then sends off a mind-control beam that overtakes all the students at the school.Sunset then reveals her true intentions: she intends to lead her ""teenage army"" into Equestria, and take it over. Gloating over how she has magic in this world over Twilight, the other girls rally around Twilight, causing Sunset to send a fireball hurtling at them. But surprisingly, a forcefield builds around the girls, and Twilight claims that the magic within the crown, still gives her power. It then turns the girls into ponified human girls, before they unite in Friendship, stripping Sunset and her minions of their power. The teenagers at the school are also freed of their mind-control as well.In the aftermath, Twilight chastises Sunset that the crown brought out the worst in her, and showed everyone what was in her heart. Sunset apologizes for what she did, and the girls say they will try and teach her about friendship, something she lacked.After a dance in the gym, Twilight wishes her new friends goodbye, before going through the portal.On the other side, Twilight's friends are eager to hear what happened, but she explains she just wants to sleep, tired from all the dancing. As she walks down a hallway, Twilight bumps into a new member of the royal guard, named Flash Sentry. Twilight grows a little quiet, and the others goad her on that she likes the new guy."

In a world where a deadly zombie virus has infected mankind, a single cure has been found. The cure, a treatment called the ""Return Protein"" which stays the effects of the virus in its host.

When it is discovered that the protein stock is running low, chaos hits the streets.

But when Alex's wallet is stolen, Kate's last hope is to get some vaccines from the director of the hospital where she works. Will she succeed?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Twenty years ago, an initial outbreak of a new virus occurred, which turned its victims into flesh and blood ravishingly zombies. One hundred million people died in that initial outbreak. Ten years ago, a natural protein was discovered at least to be a way to manage infections, as that protein, administered initially within thirty-six hours of infection with a booster every twenty-four hours keeps the virus at bay. Any missed dose of the protein leads to irreparable damage by the virus in its host, turning him/her into a zombie. There is still no known cure for the virus. Researchers are working on creating a synthetic version of the protein as the medical community is aware, but what is only rumored to be the case within the public consciousness, is that there are depleting sources of the naturally occurring protein. Those infected are treated at special hospitals and clinics to control the distribution of the protein, and so that the authorities can track those infected, who are called The Returned. Kate, a physician who treats The Returned and advocates for research funding, knows the dire situation of needing to develop a synthetic alternative of the protein. She has a personal connection as her live-in boyfriend, music teacher Alex Green, is a Returned, information which only those that need to know are aware, they only recently having told his longtime best friend, Jacob. Kate has been purchasing doses of the protein on the black market just in case. There are already those who are vehemently anti-Returned and want draconian measures to deal with them, but if the rumors do come to the public consciousness regardless of their accuracy, all out paranoia may ensue, which may place both Kate and Alex's lives at risk, especially if it is discovered that Alex is a Returned and that Kate is stockpiling the protein for Alex's use.—Huggo"

Kayla tries to convince Beth otherwise, but Beth stands with her choice.Beth then asks Paul Lazarini, a veterinarian who lost his license for committing a felony and a friend of Tess to coach the team, to which he agrees. The team starts off rough with infighting among Clementine and Roxie, but Paul manages to get all of them to stop and reminds all of them to use their innate abilities and to use it to their advantage. He even manages to get them more focused with playing. Roxie designs the team's uniforms which Ginger prints up. Roxie then goes to her friend Roy and asks him to serve as Referee for their games as he has taken it up as a second job due to money being tight for him.Beth later discovers that no one's betting in the pool and that they have less than $200. While meeting with the others and telling them about these new problems, Beth tells them that she doesn't know if her marriage is good. Just then Millie and her friends come by and deliver backhanded complements to them.The first game has very few spectators and the betting pools now has $400. Paul convinces them to go and play and tells them that his Aunt died of Breast Cancer as her town didn't have a mobile unit to treat her. Roy is unable to referee the game due to food poisoning, but the Hot Flashes manage to score 18 points, despite losing to the Lady Armadillos who score 37 as well Clementine pulling a muscle and some harassment from the Lady Armadillos' coach Slaughter, who is also one of Clementine's ex-husbands. As the Hot flashes leave, Millie lies by saying that Ginger tried to feel her up.As Kayla and Millie leave, Kayla gives Beth a back handed complement and makes a homophobic insult about Ginger. Beth then gets into an argument with them with Kayla saying that Millie Has followed and respects the bible. Beth rebukes them by telling them that Millie and another boy were making out at the miniature golf course a week earlier and blackmails her to not insult Ginger or she'll put it on Facebook. Kayla then insults Beth and says the Hot flashes are a bad influence and believes that everyone in town will listen to her instead.As Beth does some more practicing for the other games, Lawrence believes she would by tired of this, but Jocelyn is sure that the Hot Flashes are taking these games and the donations seriously. One day, when Beth comes home, she discovers a hair pin that doesn't belong to her or Jocelyn in Lawrence's truck and believes that he's having an affair. When he comes home, he denies it and says something misogynistic to her. When Jocelyn comes home, she's angry at Beth for listening to her phone calls, which is how she found out about the golf course incident. Even though Beth wasn't eavesdropping to get Millie grounded and says that Millie deserved it for what she did to Ginger, Jocelyn's team mates are barely speaking to her.At game 2, the Hot Flashes are more focused and are no longer in fighting. There's also $1,500 in the betting pool and Paul tells the team that they have to win this game or they won't be able to get the third. Roy has recovered from his food poisoning and manages to let the Hot Flashes get away with dirty Techniques, which makes Kayla angry. Millie attempts to insult Clementine, only for Clementine to insult her back. Coach Slaughter also threatens Roy for allowing the Hot Flashes to get away with their dirty playing. The Hot flashes then Win 39 to 38.While celebrating their win at a local bar, Paul notices that Lawrence has left. Beth tells Paul that ever since the Post Office had to layoff several workers, Lawrence has been working overtime every night. Roxie and the others convince her to go down and temp him with a ""special delivery"". A newspaper reporter comes by for Photos and Clementine offers a story on how the team got started as Ginger tells them that she sold her pickup truck and got them some money.Beth asks Roxie to drop her off at the Post Office so she can visit Lawrence. When Beth Visits, she hears Kayla and discovers that Lawrence is having an affair with her. They then discover that Beth has found them out. The next morning, Jocelyn is still mad at Beth, while Lawrence says that his affair with Kayla is due to her husband working on an Oil Rig. Beth doesn't believe him and when he tries to leave, she demands that he be honest. He then says that Beth being with the Hot Flashes makes her feel 18 again and that's how he feels with Kayla.Heartbroken, Beth Doesn't want to attend the game. When her teammates show up at her house, they tell her that they didn't know about the affair either. Beth feels that Lawrence will leave her and that she'll be completely alone when Jocelyn goes to College and that she also helped that playing again would make Lawrence see her the way he used to. However, the other women tell her that they're standing by her. Beth then tells them that she was the reason the mobile unit ran out of money as she forgot to reapply and that she was too ashamed to tell them. Her team mates don't care about that and Florine reads the newspaper article on them and the praise they're receiving, telling Beth that she would be quitting on all of them. This gets Beth back on her feet to practice for the last game.When they arrive at the High School, Slaughter says that School Board has banned the whole team from using the Gymnasium for believing them to be bad influences and their third game has been canceled. He then insults them by calling them inferior. Beth decides to go to the school board's meeting the next night to get them to play there again. She learns that they were banned from playing due to smoking, bribing Roy, ""Promoting homosexuality"" and ""excessive"" Profanity. Beth Looks at the letter and Discovers that Kayla filled the complaint. Beth offers to have the team Improve their behavior, but the men still refuse. Beth tries a new approach, telling them that their wives were High School Cheerleaders and called all of them on her way to the meeting and offered them to do a halftime performance. The men call their wives and after hearing that Beth was telling the truth, decide to lift the ban. When Beth comes home, she tells Lawrence not to come to the last game if he wants to continue his affair.On the day of the last game, Paul tells them that the betting pool has been raised to $25,000, their newspaper interview went viral and that ''Good Morning America'' wants to do a pregame interview with one of them. The women vote Roxie to give the interview and she does well. Before the Game begins, Beth notices that Jocelyn is still mad at her and that Lawrence hasn't shown up while Roxie's husband and Clementine's lesbian lover have.During the halftime performance, Kayla's husband returns from the oil rig, having decided to work back home, while Lawrence shows up near the end of the final quarter, in which Millie trips Beth. During a time-out, Beth notices that Lawrence has shown up while Paul successfully asks Laurie out. When Jocelyn asks Millie why she tripped Beth, Millie Just says it was accidental. Jocelyn then tells three of her other teammates that Millie was having sex with their boyfriends, causing them to ignore her and play in a new manner to make sure that the Hot Flashes win. Beth Manages to score the winning shot and reconciles with Jocelyn, while Clementine is now on better terms with Slaughter.Afterwards, Lawrence tells Beth how proud he is of her, but when she asks why he came so late, she realizes that Kayla left him instead of the other way around and kicks him out. Lawrence says that Beth can't make it alone at her age, but Beth tells him that while he has been completely unsupportive, her teammates have been there for her more than he was. With the new money, the clinic remains opened.Six months later, Laurie is working at the Clinic and is engaged to Paul, while Florine is now the Mayor of Burning Bush. Even though Kayla is still working at the Church, her reputation has been destroyed as Millie got herself Pregnant. Jocelyn is away at College and Beth reveals that her website site has been making a lot of money as she prepares to write about making it alone, showing that she has divorced Lawrence and is doing well for herself."

Detective Conan: Private Eye in the Distant Sea,2013,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3303446/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Conan and his friends search for a foreign spy who might have also committed a murder. At Maizuru Bay, on the dawn of April 20, a coast guard named Masaaki Kurata finds a suspicious boat during his patrol. Upon examining the inside of the boat, he discovers some explosives and immediately reports this to the Wakasa Coast Guard. The discovery quickly hits the news reports, where is it revealed that the boat contains data and components not found in Japan. It's also believed to have entered Japan illegally.On the same morning, Conan Edogawa, Ran and Kogoro Mouri, Sonoko Suzuki and the Detective Boys board an Aegis Destroyer warship, Hotaka, to experience public military exercises after they've won the tickets. Before getting aboard, Conan receives a call from Professor Agasa, who's currently in Osaka together with Ai Haibara, via the newly added satellite-phone on his Stun-Gun Wristwatch. The professor wants to test if the new gadget is working properly, but doesn't forget to leave a quiz for the children before hanging up.After boarding the ship, the participants are gathered at a meeting room. While the Chief Navigator Fumitada Inoue is explaining about the exercise schedule, Ran mentions that her watch was broken and sent to be repaired. Mitsuhiko then lends her his waterproof radio-controlled watch, which sets itself at 5 AM and 5 PM every day according to radio transmitters. Suddenly, they hear a strange loud sound. Fumitada explains that it was just the sound of the pumping system operating, however, Conan wonders whether that was really the case.The participants are guided into the ship's Combat Information Center (CIC), where they are to witness a simulated anti-air combat. However, after having ""shot down"" the two set-up targets, the guards continue to detect a sonar response. An unidentified target of unknown nationality slowly approaches the ship. The tactical action officer quickly reports this to their captain, Yukio Tateishi, who orders them to search for the target, before heading to the CIC himself. Following him is a female Self-Defense Force (SDF) member, Nanami Fujii. The civilian participants are generally impressed by the realistic and tense atmosphere of the training, only Conan realizes that they're truly under attack. Yukio instructs the crews to prepare for an anti-submarine combat. They decide to fire a torpedo towards the unknown object. The ship is slightly hit with the shock wave caused by the impact. Conan then notices a sick boy with no accompanying adult. The crews are relieved that their target is nothing but a shipwreck. Fumitada announces to the participants that the ""exercises"" are now over.The participants arrive at the deck during free time. Conan sees the boy from before, who is called ""Yuuki-kun"" by a man nearby. Conan wonders if the man is Yuuki's father, and finds it suspicious that he didn't notice the shock, and wouldn't show himself until after the free time had started. He decides to follow the two, only to be stopped by Kogoro. Conan then notices Nanami Fujii, who's also on the deck at the time. Conan borrows Mitsuhiko's camera and begs Nanami to take a group photo with them, attempting to get a close-up shot of her. When asked about her specific work on the ship, Nanami answers that she only cooks everyone's meal, a lie that Conan can easily perceive due to her captain-ranked insignia. Before Nanami leaves, Kogoro reaches for one of his flashy business card as he wants to hand it to her himself. Unfortunately, the detective's clumsiness causes the cards to fly all around them. They pick the cards up and give them to Ran.Conan borrows Mitsuhiko's camera again and runs off to a corner. He gives Agasa a call via the satellite-phone and asks him to investigate Nanami basing on the picture that he sent to Haibara, specifically from which department does the SDF member come from. The ship crews detect a satellite transmission from where Conan was calling Agasa. They suspect that ""X"" is among the civilians. Conan then sees some crew members checking his previous hiding spot. He wonders whether they have found out about the call, or it was actually something else.Conan plans to chase after the crew members with the excuse of ""going to the toilet"", but Ran doesn't trust him and suggests that the two go together. On the way, Ran mentions that she almost got lost earlier, which reminds Conan that Ran isn't always good with directions. He remembers the time when Ran also got lost at Tropical Land. However, she wasn't afraid of getting lost again, because she knew that Shinichi would always find her, as he's a great detective; to which Shinichi replied: ""Don't you worry! I'll always find you, wherever you are.""Unsurprising to Conan, Ran gets lost again as their path was blocked with a forbidden sign. Suddenly, they hear a scream coming from a room beyond the limit. Upon arriving, they see a human arm wearing SDF's Lieutenant uniform on the table. They advise the crew members to consult Kogoro.In Osaka, Heiji Hattori gets a call from Conan, who informs him of the situation. He, together with Kazuha Toyama, heads off to Maizuru. The ship crews detect Conan's satellite signal again but don't find any transmitter. It is then that he learns of the person with the code name ""X"". Unfortunately, Conan's phone rings again as he receives a call from Agasa, who's about to inform him that their search for Nanami didn't find any match. However, he manages to hide before the crew members discover him. Conan then looks for a different method of communication, and he comes across a room with strong magnetic field.Meanwhile, inside the bridge, Hotaka's Captain Yukio Tateishi and Captain Makoto Sekiguchi from the Wakasa Military Police discuss the case with Kogoro and Ran. Kogoro deduces that the arm wasn't cut off by a sharp blade and was removed post-mortem. As it was found inside the pumping system's filter, they conclude that the arm was sucked in by the pumping system and got stuck in the filter, making the loud sound from earlier. Yukio hesitantly reveals that the arm probably belongs to Lt. Sasaura from the Wakasa base, whose whereabouts is currently unknown. Kogoro agrees with this assumption after seeing that his clock stopped at 5:30 AM that morning. According to Yukio, Sasaura wasn't in that day's shift. As the pumping system was started when they left Maizuru Harbor, Sasaura's body must have already drifted at the time. Fearing that it would be too late for an autopsy when they get back, Conan hints that they use the helicopter to transport the arm, pretending that it's only a demonstration. Kogoro then informs Inspector Megure of the case, not knowing that Nanami is watching nearby.Conan and Ran encounter Yuuki when they come to watch the ""demonstration"", and notice that his father is missing again. Yuuki doesn't want to let Ran tell the crews about his situation and attempts to run away before dropping some medicines for food allergies. Just as he's about to leave, Yuuki's father appears. Conan comes to the magnetic room and contacts Agasa, in order to avoid being discovered. Haibara tells him about her discovery. Meanwhile, at a shipyard in Wakasa Bay, Heiji and Kazuha find Sasaura's body. Heiji notices a red stain on Sasaura's neck and secretly retrieves it.Inspector Megure, Miwako Sato, Wataru Takagi and two officers from Wakasa Coast Guard, Masaaki Kurata and Tsutomu Munekawa, arrive at the ship in a helicopter. Heiji informs Conan that he's found the body at Wakasa Bay. He surmises that Sasaura drifted there after having his arm swallowed at Maizuru Harbor. After hearing about the red stain, Conan asks Heiji to meet up with Agasa.While the civilians are having lunch, the police suggest an investigation on the ship, considering that the victim might have been sucked into the pump before she ship departed. Conan follows them to the deck, where they find Sasaura's phone. The last email was after 9 PM and the last call was at 5:30 AM. According to the autopsy, his death was between 4 AM and 6 AM and the cause of death is drowning, which means that he was on the ship before falling into the sea at 5:30 AM. Kogoro deduces that Sasaura had a fight with someone on the deck and was eventually pushed down. This also confirms that his body was stuck in the filter before the departure, and the arm was severed when they left Maizuru Harbor. Sato finds an empty micro SD slot on the phone. Kogoro thinks that the card was the culprit's target. Conan then sees Nanami spying on the investigation and gives chase.Nanami enters the captain's office and checks the content of the micro SD card stolen from Sasaura's phone. Conan imitates the captain's voice to trick her out of the room. Conan finds out that she hasn't completely deleted the extracted data and attempts to copy them into the new USB flash drive on his watch. However, Nanami realizes that she was tricked and quickly makes her way back to the office, Conan is thus unable to retrieve all of the data. She wonders why X is interested in the data. To uncover her true identity, Conan deliberately sends the data to Agasa from within the room, creating a detectable satellite signal.The police arrive at the captain's office. They demands that Nanami explain herself, but Yukio and Makoto refuse to cooperate. Conan then comes out and innocently points out all of the contradictory facts about Nanami, forcing her to reveal herself as a member of the Intelligence Security Command. Due to the incident with the foreign boat, they suspect that the spy X, whose target is believed to be classified intel on Aegis Destroyers, might be on board. It's also revealed that the victim was the Director of Intelligence for the Wakasa SDF base. His duty was to guard information on Aegis Destroyers. Because of this, they suspect that X was the killer. Conan wonders why Nanami doesn't talk about the card. He plants a bug on Kogoro before running off.Conan asks Heiji, who's now inside Agasa's car, about the red stain. They learn that it's anti-fouling paint, a special paint used for ships. Conan asks them to check if the paint was from Hotaka. Heiji says that there is no current that could've sent the victim's body from Maizuru Harbor to Wakasa Bay. Conan then asks about the data from earlier, about which Agasa reveals that it's indeed a data of Aegis Destroyers, and was copied from a cloud service. If they have the ID and password, they can get the original data from the cloud. Conan wonders why would Sasaura store such important data on a public cloud service. He instructs Agasa to access the cloud data and send it to the captain's office.Back in the captain's office, Kogoro asks Inspector Fumimaro Ayanokoji, who's just arrived, to share the result of his investigation. Having investigated the victim's actions before his death, Fumimaro reveals that at 5:30 AM, Sasaura was waving a Japanese flag on a cliff at Maizuru Harbor, as witnessed by a crew member of a sightseeing cruise nearby. He then asks Makoto about the interrogation of Sasaura, but Nanami doesn't let the latter answer. Luckily, Agasa sends the data as instructed, forcing Makoto to reveal that data about the ships have been leaked by Sasaura, and sent to a shell company of a spy called Takekawa. This, together with the suspicious boat, indicates that a spy from the same country as Takekawa attempted to board this ship with the victim's help. It also explains Nanami's motive for taking the memory card. Nanami contacts her superior, and learns that Takekawa has been spotted in Kyoto. His plan is to meet up with X, who's currently on board. They then work together to track down Takekawa.Components from the same country as the ones in the foreign boat was found on the shipwreck. As the sailing route of the ship was changed from right to left that morning and only people from the Wakasa base knew about this, X wouldn't have known the true direction to send out the shipwreck. However, the flag that Sasaura waved turns out to be a signal flag, the purpose of which was to inform X of the change. Nanami becomes suspicious of Conan's knowledge.Takekawa was spotted at 12:03 PM in Ponto Town Park (Kyoto), where he's shown dropping something into a trash can. Conan asks Heiji to go to the park before the police do. At 12:10 PM, Takekawa got on an express train to Osaka. They then ask the Osaka Police to cooperate.Heiji manages to catch up before the police arrive and takes a photo of Takekawa's burned memo.Back at the cafeteria, Conan revises the whole case and realizes X's motive for sending the shipwreck. Unexpectedly, Nanami approaches him and questions about his identity. Without telling her the truth, Conan drops his facade and directly asks Nanami whether there is any kind of data that can only be obtained on the ship. Nanami confirms his theory and says that the only two places where such data can be found are the CIC and captain's office. Conan deduces that during the emergency, the captain had to come to the CIC; that's when X made his move in the captain's office. He now realizes who X is and quickly runs off, with Nanami and Ran chasing behind. Makoto then informs Nanami that they spotted Takekawa at Yodoyabashi Station (Osaka). Conan tells Heiji to go after him, while he confronts X himself.The man who claims to be Yuuki Amemiya's father is spy X. Conan tells Yuuki to hide away before exposing that the man's not his real father. X attempts to silence Conan, but then flees because there are two many civilians on the deck. Conan gives chase, but Yuuki, fearing about his real father's safety, intervenes. Meanwhile, after examining the picture of Takekawa's burned memo, Heiji concludes that Takekawa will come to Senshu Airport (now known as Kansai International Airport). He reports this to Inspector Goro Otaki.Conan tells the police that Yuuki's father vanished at Maizuhu Harbor, where Yuuki was forced to board with a strange man. Because Conan also remembers X's face, they invite him to check the camera footage. The Osaka police head to Kansai Airport in chase of Takekawa.X destroys the footage before Conan can locate him. Yuuki wants to help them catch X, so Fumitada goes together with him, only to be assaulted by the spy. X takes Yuuki to the deck and are spotted by Ran, who's looking for Conan. Yuuki tells Ran about X's true identity. Ran fights X, but is eventually defeated and thrown into the sea.At Kansai Airport, Kazuha spots Takekawa and tries to catch him. She chases him to a dead end. Takekawa shoots Kazuha, but Heiji jumps in and takes the bullet for her. Luckily, Otaki arrives just in time to stop Takekawa. Kazuha cries even though Heiji's not fatally wounded.Meanwhile, Yuuki leads the police to X. While Miwako and the others chase X, Conan instructs Nanami to ambush on the deck. X takes a crew member hostage. Conan tells Nanami to rotate the cannon anticlockwise. Before X manages to escape, Conan uses the setting to kick a ball at him.After the two spies are captured, they discover a suspicious voice-mail sent by Sasaura to Takekawa, which was recorded at 5:30 AM. Conan hears sounds of waves, some metallic clicking sounds and a man's voice in the record. Agasa calls him to inform that the paint wasn't from Hotaka, but from a sightseeing cruise, which left Maizuru Harbor and passed by Wakasa Shipyard. Conan deduces that the victim's body was dragged along the cruise from Maizuru Harbor to Wakasa Harbor. After revising all of the evidences, Conan realizes he has been misled.Sasaura's death was an accident. He slipped into the ocean and drowned after being chased by Masaaki Kurata, who thought he was someone suspicious.Direct evidences:The person who stole the card was Nanami, not X, which means that X has no clear motive to kill Sasaura, who's supposed to be his accomplice.
The time when the victim's watch stopped, his last phone call, the voice-mail record, and the sightseeing cruise staff witnessed him waving a flag on a cliff at Maizuru Harbor all match with his estimated time of death: 5:30 AM. This clearly indicates that Sasaura fell from the cliff itself, not from Hotaka.
The same sightseeing cruise, not Hotaka, dragged his body all the way to Wakasa Harbor further proves that he was never on the ship.
It also shows that the last location of his phone would be near the cliff, not on the ship.
Nobody noticed the phone despite being left at a very obvious place. This shows that it hadn't been on the ship since the victim died, but was actually brought recently from the real ""crime scene"" after they departed, during midday. Masaaki was one of the people who had the chance to do this.
The metallic sound heard in the record was the sound made when an expandable baton and a gun bump into each other, both of which Masaaki is wearing. He's the only one to patrol near Maizuru Harbor at the time.Other hints:
At the beginning of the movie, Masaaki is already shown running down the cliff in hurry for some unknown reasons, despite not having even seen the suspicious boat yet. He was trying to find Sasaura at the time, who had just fallen into the sea.Conan breaks down to tears when he believed Ran has certainly died, and reliefs when Ran is found submerged by the helicopter went to rescue her, she was immediately carried to the hospital. After Kurata is arrested, Yuuki reunites with his real father. Fujii asks Conan who he really is, but Conan simply replies he is just an elementary school student."

It's up to Mak to choose love or reality.—anonymous The story is set in mid-19th century Siam, during the era of King Mongkut and at the height of the Rattanakosin Dynasty, when Siam was plagued with wars with its neighboring kingdoms. Mak (Mario Maurer) was drafted to serve in a war, forcing him to leave behind his pregnant wife Nak (Davika Hoorne) at the town of Phra Khanong, not far from Central Bangkok. He was wounded during a battle and sent to a medical camp, where he met fellow soldiers Ter, Puak, Shin and Aey, who later became his best friends after he had saved them from certain death. Meanwhile, in Phra Khanong, Nak struggled alone painfully to give birth to the baby; she calls out for help, but she is too weak to be heard. Shortly after, rumors started circulating the village that Nak had died in labor and was now a ghost of a very powerful form haunting the house. The villagers in the neighborhood then heard her singing lullabies to her baby, terrifying them and forcing them to cower in fear. When Mak and his friends arrive back in Phra Khanong in the evening, they find the town completely silent. The five soon arrive at Mak and Nak's house during the night, and Mak introduces Nak to them. As it is now too dark to continue traveling, Mak's friends decide to stay. The following day, the men visit the village market but are shunned by the fearful community. A drunk villager attempts to shout out a warning to Mak but is forced down and hushed by her son. Mak's four friends then discuss what they had heard, but dismiss the rumors as ridiculous. Shin, however, while he was sent to fetch Mak, saw that the house was a dilapidated wreck that hadn't been maintained for months, that the baby cot that Mak and Nak's son, Dang, was supposed to be sleeping in, was rocking by itself, and then he saw Nak extending her arm to an unnatural length to retrieve a dropped lime under the house. The following day, Ter discovers a decomposed corpse behind the house wearing exactly the same ring as Nak. The drunk villager who had also tried to warn them earlier also turned up mysteriously drowned. Soon, all four friends are convinced that she is a ghost. The friends then try numerous methods to convince Mak of the news, including a game of charades, and come within inches of being murdered by Nak, with only Mak's presence preventing her from doing so, and she scares them away. Worse, Mak dismisses all of their warnings, proclaims that they are no longer his friends, and kicks them out of their accommodations.Later, Mak and Nak go out on a date in the town, visiting an amusement park. Mak's friends' attempt to separate the two by kidnapping Mak, but their plans are foiled when Nak discovers them and chases them away. Suddenly, during the getaway, Mak's old wartime wound reopens. His friends express surprise at how slowly it has healed, but Shin and Ter become convinced that he, not Nak, is the ghost, and their fears are seemingly confirmed when Mak reacts in pain when they attack him with holy rice. The friends then flee from their wounded friend and rescue Nak. While escaping in a boat, Mak 'returns' to them, walking into the river to them, but ends up almost drowning when he suffers cramps. As ghosts are not supposed to feel cramps, Mak is revealed to not have been a ghost, and he is rescued; when asked why he screamed when hit by the holy rice, he reveals that the rice had riddled his wound, making him yell out in pain. In the following confusion, Aey drops a ring identical to the one Mak, Nak, and the body behind the house had been wearing. Aey is immediately pronounced a ghost and kicked off the boat. The others then try to escape, but, as they had lost the paddles to the boat earlier, they cannot move. Nak then somehow produces a soaking wet paddle and hands it to Ter, who suddenly recalls that all of them had been thrown overboard, and had already drifted too far away for a normal person to recover. Ter then stands up on the boat to look between his legs at the group; Nak is revealed to have been the ghost all along, and the four remaining men, including Mak, retreat to a temple.There, the men come under the protection of the local monk, armed with holy rice, holy water, and the temple is fortified with an enchanted 'safety ring.' Nak quickly appears, in her terrifying ghostly form, and attacks. Initially, the holy 'weapons' successfully keep Nak at bay, but, in a panic, coupled with Mak's struggle to get back to his wife, all of the holy rice and water are wasted, and the monk was accidentally kicked out of the ""safety ring."" The monk then fled the temple, leaving the four, who had since destroyed the 'safety ring' while trying to run, to face the angry Nak. A pale Aey then reappears, and it was revealed that he is also human; he was in possession of the ring because he had stolen it off of the corpse behind the house to finance his gambling. Nak angrily shouted at the five that she just wanted to be with her loved one, which the four friends argued against since they didn't believe the living can be with the dead, and accuse her of killing the drunk; Nak furiously denies her involvement and says that the drunk had drowned herself. Nak, in a combination of sadness, anger, and desperation, then threatens to kill Mak and take him to live with her, but stops when she sees how much she had been scaring her husband. Mak then revealed he knew the truth about Nak all along, having had his suspicions raised during the game of charades. He had already looked at Nak between his legs, which revealed her ghostly form, and found her decomposed corpse. However, even then, he is far more afraid of living without her than of her being dead. The two tearfully reconcile. His friends, seeing them reuniting, also tearfully reaffirm their friendship, and vow to never leave each other again. A flashback to Mak and Nak's first meeting is shown.In the credit scenes, Mak, his wife and now his four friends live happily in the village. Nak uses her supernatural abilities to do chores, play charades (and helping Mak win for the first time), scare off villagers attempting to drive her away (who are led by the village drunk's son) and even run the town's 'haunted house' attraction. It is also revealed that her child, Dang, also possesses some of her abilities, even though he is still an infant."

While efforts to convince both the government and the terrorist go awry, Yoon realizes there is a bomb rigged on him and falls in sheer terror.—Studio Yoon Young-hwa (Ha Jung-woo) was once a top news anchor, but gets demoted due to an unsavory incident. Pulled from primetime TV news and recently divorced, he is now the jaded and bitter host of a current affairs radio program. One day during his morning show, Yoon receives a peculiar phone call threatening to blow up the Mapo Bridge, a major bridge that crosses the Han River and connects Mapo District and Yeouido, Seoul's main business and investment banking district; it is also just outside Yoon's studio building. At first, Yoon takes it as a joke or prank call and tells the terrorist to proceed. He watches in shock as the caller follows through on the threat and detonates explosives that cause Mapo Bridge to collapse, killing innocent people and trapping others.Realizing this could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make his comeback as a newscaster, Yoon purposely doesn't call the police. Instead, he sets up a makeshift television studio from his radio station, and negotiates with his former boss, the profit- and ratings-obsessed news producer Cha Dae-eun (Lee Geung-young) who'll do anything to beat the other TV stations in their coverage of the bombing. Then Yoon strikes a dangerous deal with the terrorist to exclusively broadcast their phone conversations live, in real-time, as the whole nation watches.The newsroom erupts in chaos as Yoon, Cha, the police, other broadcasters and the Blue House all exploit terrorism for their own agenda. The only exception is Yoon's ex-wife, a reporter who volunteers to report from the site of the terrorist attack. As the live show progresses, Yoon gradually realizes how little control he has over the situation. The terrorist, who claims to be a 50-something construction worker who lost three of his coworkers in a senseless industrial accident while fixing the bridge, says the families of the victims weren't compensated and demands a public apology from the president for the deaths of his colleagues. With several people remaining on the bridge as hostages, the terrorist threatens a second explosion. He also reveals to Yoon alone that he put a bomb in the anchor's earphone, and that if the president doesn't apologize, the bomb will explode in his ear, live on air."

She used the mantra as a test and got Sun God's son Karna (Anil Kapoor). But she was unmarried and sent Karna down the Ganga river.
Then she married Pandu and bore then 3 god sons (Yudhisthir (Manoj Bajpayee), Bheem (Sunny Deol) and Arjun (Ajay Devgn)). She gave the mantra to Pandu's 2nd wife Madri who bore Nakul and Sahdev. Pandu's elder brother Dhritarashtra (Dhyaan JN) is blind and married to Gandhari. They have 100 sons, Duryodhan (Jackie Shroff) is eldest. All royal sons are trained by Dronacharya (Ashutosh Rana).Yrs later, Pandu is dead and Dhritarashtra is King. A royal competition is organized to introduce the princes to their masses under the watchful eyes of Bhishma (Amitabh Bachchan).
Drona introduces Arjun as the best archer in land, after the fight between Bheem and Duryodhan is a draw. Karna challenges Arjun. Shakuni (Anupam Kher) is Duryodhan's maternal uncle and Dushasana (Vrajesh Hirjee) is his younger bro.. Arjun refuses to fight Karna when Bheem points out that he is the son of a charioteer. Kunti recognizes Karna as her son but keeps quiet. Shakuni finds an opportunity and Duryodhan anoints Karna as the King of Anga to enable him to fight Arjun. The fight is called a draw eventually..Lastly Bhishma and Vidur announce Yudhisthir as the crown prince in the assembly. Duryodhana feels cheated of his birthright and Shakuni prompts him to burn the Pandav brothers alive in a specially constructed palace built from combustible materials. With the help from Vidur, the Pandavas knew about his scheme and are able to escape alive. They are met by Vidur who helps them cross the river. Vidur advises Pandavas to gather allies during their tour away from Hastinapur, incognito.
Bheem protects the Pandavas in the forest. Himdimba is a rakshasa who falls in love with Bheem. Bheem is attacked by her brother Hidimb and Hidimba helps Bheem defeat her own brother, who kills Hidimb. Kunti asks Hidimba to ask for a boon and she wishes to marry Bheem.King Drupad announces the swayamvar of his daughter princess Draupadi. All the kings arrive, including Karna and Duryodhan. Arjun arrives as a sage. Duryodhan misses and Draupadi refuses to marry the son of a charioteer. Arjun approaches as a Brahman. Duryodhan objects and wants to kidnap Draupadi, when Krishna (Shatrughan Sinha) intervenes and reveals Arjun's true identity. Arjun wins the Swayamvar and takes Draupadi home, where Kunti tells the boys to share whatever they got, without realizing they were talking about a woman.
Krishna again explains that Draupadi had asked Shiva for a boon for a husband in her previous life, but asked for it 5 times. So Shiva gave her a boon of 5 husbands in the next life. With this Krishna asks Pandavas to return to Hastinapur after 5 yrs.
Bhishma asks Dritrashtra to divide the kingdom into 2 parts, but Shakuni plays a dirty game by allocating the desert and rocky Khandavprastha to Pandavas. Kunti asks Arjun to pray to Indra, who assigns Vishwakarma to construct a majestic palace and a city, Indraprastha
Then Bheem kills Jarasandha who had captured 100 kings for sacrifice. The 100 kings are released and they side with Yudhisthira, who becomes a king of kings. Arjun marries Krishna's sister Subhadra, who Balram wanted to marry off to Duryodhana. Subhadra gives birth to Abhimanyu.Duryodhan comes to visit the magical palace and is insulted by Draupadi when he falls into a moat of water. Arjun and Yudhisthir tell Draupadi that the enmity between the Kauravas and Pandavas was over, but this insult will stoke the fires of revenge once more.
Duryodhan invites Pandavas to Hastinapur for a gambling match. Gambling is Yudhisthir's weakness. He loses his kingdom, then his brothers, then himself and lastly his wife. Finally he gambles away a 12 yr forest stay + 1 yr of hidden stay. Dushana drags Draupadi to the court and Duryodhan orders to disrobe her in public. Bheem vows to break Duryodhan's thigh and Draupadi vows not to tie her hair till she washes them with Dushana's blood. Krishna stops the disrobing.

After the yr is complete Krishna goes to Hastinapur to ask for Pandavas share of the Kingdom. Duryodhan refuses to part even with the 5 villages that Krishna proposes as a compromise. Duryodhan moves to capture Krishna, but he shows his Vishnu form and walks away.
War prep starts and Bhishma is appointed commander in chief. He says he will not allow Karna to fight in the war. Armies gather for the war. Arjun has the last minute doubts and Krishna gives him the Gita summary and shows him his eternal view and dispel his doubts and convince him to fight the war.
To defeat Bhishma, Krishna puts Shikhandi in front of Arjun. Shikhandi is a man, but Bhishma recognizes him as a woman he had wronged in her previous life. Arjun fires a volley of hundreds of arrows into Bhishma and he finally falls on a bed of arrows.Dronacharya is the next commander and he launches the Chakravyuh when Arjun is away for battle, to capture Yudhisthir. Abhimanyu steps up, but he only knows how to enter and not exit. As Abhimanyu destroys the formations, Shakuni steps off his chariot to hug Abhimanyu as a great warrior of the clan. Then all the kaurav warrior stab him one by one and he dies.
Karna is appointed CIC once Drona dies. Kunti approaches him and tells him that she is his mother. She begs for the lives of her 5 sons. Karna promises to spare everyone but Arjun, to keep her sons count to 5. He also says that he already gave away his solar defensive skins to Indra, when he came under the disguise of a beggar. After a fierce battle, Karna dies when his chariot gets stuck in the mud and Arjun fires an arrow upon Krishna's insistence since Karna also killed Abhimanyu when he was defenseless.
Shakuni is killed by Sahdev. Duryodhan runs from the battlefield while Bheem kills Dushasan after yanking his arms. He takes the blood to Draupadi for her to wash her hair and tie them again. Pandavas track Duryodhan to a pond, where Bheem kills him after breaking his thigh.

In 20xx, the world is divided into two powers: the Western Block and the Eastern Block. Serving as a border zone between the two is ""J-Country."" As such, it is used as a battleground for the two sides in their never-ending conflict. Mylene, an undercover agent from the western block, has been hiding out in J-Country. While investigating human trafficking, she meets a young man named Chris. Mylene finds herself attracted to Chris and after completing her mission and returning to headquarters she is unable to keep him out of her mind. ""Recover Dr. Klein and see to her protection!"" is the newest mission assigned to Mylene from the 00 agency. Abducted by the Eastern Block, Dr. Klein was in charge of the Faust Project and the technology that made Mylene into a cyborg.

""Recover Dr. Klein and see to her protection!"" is the newest mission assigned to Mylene from the 00 agency.Abducted by the Eastern Block, Dr. Klein was in charge of the Faust Project and the technology that made Mylene into a cyborg. During the briefing for the mission she puzzles over a name that sparks memories buried within her cyborg mind. Breaking into the laboratory where the doctor is being held, Mylene is surprised to find Chris being used as an experimental guinea pig. Distracted, she is unable to complete her mission and agents of the east take Dr. Klein away. Failing in her mission, Mylene has her license revoked by the agency. Spurred by the increasing flashes of memories locked away within her, she sets out on a mission of her own: to take back her memories and learn who she really is.—Nikkatsu Corporation It's easy for spies to access J Country, now that The West Bloc and the East Bloc countries are at each other's throats. A girl gets access to Stinger, an underworld boss, and gets into his bed as easily. Spider exposes her as an infiltrated agent, and he is well protected, but the girl defeats them all in hand-to-hand fight and using their guns against them. But Spider points a gun to her head. She drops her gun, then drops the white sheet that she had managed to keep wrapping her body, exposing her breasts to him. Spider downs his eyes from her face to her breasts, as she - with a slight movement of her chest muscles, puts several slugs into his stomach. Slider falls down in a pool of gore, just as he recognizes the girl who killed him is the West Bloc agent 009-1.Slinger's girlfriend, Butterfly, is at the ""morgue"", choosing people to be killed to extract their vital organs for transplants. 009-1 gains access to the place that is protected by fingerprint detection, using Slinger's forefinger, and then she throws Slinger's severed arm at Butterfly's feet, with contempt. 009-1 disposes of a handful of bodyguards in a quick gunfight, then battles Butterfly hand-to-hand, countering the girls' attacks with blade weapons. Before running away, Butterfly calls 009-1, ""Monster!""009-1 remembers in flash-back how she had lost her parents, was chosen by the 00 Department to serve the Western Bloc, and was trained as a spy. The Department head, 020, instructs her to rescue Dr. Clyne, the scientist responsible for Project Faust - the mass production of human beings. Dr. Clyne has been captured in her lab by three East Bloc agents, now waiting for ex-filtration from J Country. 009-1 arrives on the premises, already surrounded by an SMA team, and the Officer taunts her, ending by saying that it's true ""what they say about you, that you're not just human, you're a monster"".Using her cyborg powers, 009-1 bypasses the net of infra-red rays that protects the compound. Yet, she is attacked by the three East Bloc agents in a ferocious battle hand-to-hand and with knives, but she beats them. Agent Shadow receives a message from headquarters, ""There is no rescue."" Shadow can't believe her ears, ""Motherland has abandoned us,"" she says, and the three agents fall in despair. 009-1 simply turns her back on them, and leaves.009-1 unties the ropes binding Dr. Clyne, and tries to bring up the subject that Dr. Clyne is her cyber mother, but the other woman turns her back on her and leaves the room. When they pass through the entrance room, the three agents are about to commit suicide, but 009-1 stops them, arguing that ""Our lives never belong to ourselves.""
East Agent #2 says, ""We get abandoned once we're useless. This is the destiny of spies. You're the same!""
Dr. Clyne picks a gun from the floor and in quick succession, shoots the enemies through their heads, and says ""It's a waste of time."" Turning to 009-1, she adds, ""Don't show me a face like that, you're just a tool."" Dr. Clyne gives orders to the SMA team, and in a brief exchange with 009-1, this one understands that the traffic of organs is something Dr. Clyne is comfortable with.009-1 stays a moment alone with a young man guinea-pig whom she had saved the day before from the ""morgue"". He doesn't remember anything about him, and she names him Chris, ""because your eyes make me think of crystals"", then asks him to sing the lullaby song he had been singing before. Closing her eyes, 009-1 seems to remember (flash-back) her father singing that lullaby to her and her brother when both were children. Sounds of shooting bring 009-1 to the present.Outside, Miriam - a cyborg in black leather - is disposing of the elements of the SMA team, as they find that their automatic weapons are useless against her immediate body reconstruction powers. 009-1 gets out and sees Miriam just as she finished killing the team leader. They fight using karate and some pro-wrestling moves. In a sort of bear hug, 009-1 unzips her red leather top to expose her breasts, and shoot Miriam in the face. But while 009-1 picks her discarded gun from the floor, Miriam has reconstructed herself, and attacks her again.
The appearance of Chris creates a distraction, but then Miriam ends up by shooting Chris - as 009-1 (flash-back) remembers a similar scene when her kid brother was abducted from home. 009-1 is able to perform a medical check on him, and concludes that his life is not at risk.She runs to the rooftop in time to see Dr. Clyne's being taken away in a helicopter that shoots a missile at her. 009-1 runs away in a motorbike, and the helicopter gives chase shooting missiles at her. Some hit at a street full of humble people, who run away. A little girl, Koto, falls, and 009-1 instinctively protects her with her body as (flash-back) her mother had done to protect her, being shot dead by soldiers. Koto's mother watches 009-1's wounds being restored on the spot, and mumbles, ""Monster!""
That downs on her, ""I am... a monster.""Later, Chris is in 009-1's room, in bed - apparently strong already, and they seem to be romantically attracted, with no common memories but that lullaby song. She tells him that her real name is Mirine. [Mylene in a different transliteration] They make love - without stripping.020 is displeased that 009-1 has not gone straight to headquarters after her mission, and that she failed to rescue Dr. Clyne to attend to Chris.
020's Secretary tells her that the other agents will take care of the matter, and asks 009-1 to hand out her gun. As she does, the Secretary says with a mocking smile, ""Bye, monster.""009-1 KO's two armed guards, knocks down the Assistant with a punch to the face, and (flash-back) using the same words of Agent #2, tells 020 that she is not a tool to be abandoned... She runs away on her motorbike, but at her room she finds Chris with his face in blood, and a bomb explodes. 020 receives a report of this, and seems happy.In a rich mansion with a swimming-pool, a magnate - and five young women in bikinis - is playing chess with a set of pieces based on Ancient Egypt. 009-1, disguised as a blonde with a wig and in a bikini, attacks a maid named Sherry, forcing a lesbian scene with her - that some of the girls watching, is interesting.
But while fondling and kissing Sherry against a window in a corner, 009-1 is progressing in her work. ""Is the map of area D really here?""
""Don't worry - The party host, Alan Lau, has it.""
""How do I get it?""
""By playing chess with Lau,"" the undercover agent Sherry answers. ""And betting your body for it.""Some time later, with all the bodyguards and waitresses watching around them, 009-1 is playing chess against Lau, and he acknowledges that she's a good player. Just as she makes a decisive move to checkmate, and demands her pay. He asks a small computer from a servant, and introduces a sort of cylindrical pen in it. It produces a moving image of its content (on a digital screen in the air) that the West Bloc agent recognizes. But Mr. Lau tells her that that military facility is now obsolete, so he wants to know, ""Why are you so interested in this?""
""To say the truth, I'm interested in ruins. The game is over, give it to me.""
Instead, he gives back the computer to the servant, and approaches her, to smell her golden hair. ""It smells so good. Smells like money.""
Suddenly, he lets himself fall on a couch, pointing a gun at her - as all the bodyguards also pull their guns on her. He demands that she tells him the truth.Suddenly the door opens, and Butterfly makes her entrance on the scene, in her usual black lace dress. Using automatic weapons, she kills a number of bodyguards, others with her fan provided with iron fangs.
Five bikini girls hide on another couch, and two maids behind a cupboard. Lau still has his gun, but he has not shot yet. He wants to know who the intruder is.
""None of your business,"" Butterfly says. ""I want the blondie [sic] over there."" Then, addressing 009-1, ""You can never fool my eyes... monster!""
With a look of resignation, the ""blonde"" takes her wig and throws it at the muzzle of Butterfly's hand machine-gun, deviating her line of fire. In a somersault, 009-1 picks a discarded gun from the floor, to shoot back at Butterfly, but she has attacked Lau, and uses his body as a shield.
009-1 shoots at his lower chest and belly, and he falls dying on the couch, yet commenting on her shooting, ""Perfect...""Both rival women throw away their empty guns, and come to grips, whirling around the room and falling on the pool outside. Wrestling in the water is fierce, both women attempting to choke or dunk the other (with underwater camera). They come out of the pool, and Butterfly has the upper-hand, and a gun she picks from the floor from one of the guards. She is shot dead by Sherry, who makes a surprise appearance from inside the house.
After they leave, 020's Secretary appears on the scene (apparently she was in the house already) and looks at the body of Butterfly afloat in the water.Sherry takes 009-1 to her place, despite she tells her that Department D is tracking her down. The relationship between Sherry and her teenage brother Kai, seems to awake some emotion in 009-1. After dinner, the two young women talk about Dr. Clyne, and 009-1 says she is still looking for her, because the scientist may know something about Mirine's past. Sherry dreams of leaving Intelligence, and live a normal life with her brother.Together, they visit the ruins where Department D is located. Mirine's runs after the sound (or fantasy) of the lullaby song, but when she thinks she has reached her mother on a rocking chair (amidst flash-backs of her youth) she is neutralized with a special weapon by someone.
Mirine awakes tied to a gurney, deprived of her red leather outfit but with a metal bra on and still wearing red knee boots. The gurney is large enough to accommodate Miriam, wearing a fetishist black leather outfit, astride Mirine and fondling and kissing her.A man tells Mirine that ""Miriam was made from the prototype of your mama,"" and indeed (amidst of flash-backs of her youth) Mirine associates the face of her mother with that of the woman who's now kissing her. The man comes forward, and Mirine recognizes Chris, who only had pretended to be dead. He explains his plan to help her get her memories back. As he talks, Miriam has taken Mirine off the gurney, though keeping her in control in a choke hold, and now the girl recognizes Paul in the man she had named Chris when they first met.
Now, he proposes that they should unite against those who had wiped off her memories. He had been raised in the East Bloc as an agent, and now he has a plan to make an atomic attack against a West Bloc and an East Bloc targets, so that both blocs annihilate each other in all out war - assuming the first attacker was the other bloc...
""A new world will arise from the ashes of the old.""
""It's wrong!"" Mirine counters. She wants to know where Dr. Clyne is.
He refuses to tell, and Miriam attacks Mirine.
In a moment of respite in the fighting, Mirine adds, ""A full-scale war will send many people to hell. Many will lose their love, like us.""
Paul is determined, though. The two women fight again, but Miriam subdues Mirine, as Paul tells further of his plan to unite his and Mirine's body to create a new generation of people. He tells her that the 00 project had failed, because all the orphans that had been operated on had all died, only 009-1 had survived.
She tells him that there are eight other agents like her, and he counters that she's wrong - she has been lied to by 020.
""Mirine, you are the only monster in this world."" Even the experiments with robots and genetic engineering had failed...
From the darkness of the room, Dr. Clyne steps forward to confirm Paul's words.
It was she who had put Mirine to sleep, and now she considers that mutants like 009-1 are obsolete, and she has developed new tools: living-dead mutants. A dozen zombie-like creatures stagger onto the room, and Sherry is among them.
Mirine attacks Dr. Clyne, who loses her ray gun, but she orders the living-dead mutants to attack. Suddenly, the group gets quite alive, and Mirine has to fight against the group, damaging many. Dr. Clyne is not worried, because ""Despite how badly damaged they are, the living-dead will always stand up again."" Dr. Clyne even laughs about it - the perfection of her work.
Mirine listens to Sherry's thoughts [by telepathy], though: ""I wanna get back to Kai.""
Paul mumbles, ""It's ugly,"" presses a button on a remote control, and the living-dead turn their attack from Mirine to Dr. Clyne. Her laughter changes into worry, she fires a pistol onto the group, without avail.
Sherry has a choke hold on Mirine, as the other living-dead gore and kill the lady scientist.Mirine still refuses to be part of Paul's incestuous plan, and Paul signals Sherry to kill Mirine. The two women fight. Sherry gets hold of Dr. Clyne's pistol, and shoots Mirine down, after Sherry cries tears of blood (literally). Mirine bends to close Sherry's eyes.
""I've finally got it. The reason why I became a monster [looking up to Paul and Miriam] is to finish this crazy world. So I've nothing to lose.""
Paul uses his remote control again, and a new group of living-dead surges from outside to attack Mirine. She mows them down with the gun, and her bare hands, and they all die in gore fashion.
""It seems that your heart is out of control,"" Paul comments. ""So, [looking at Miriam] at least, I want your body."" Then, addressing Miriam, he says, ""Mama, follow me.""Miriam attacks Mirine, and the two women fight using martial arts. Mirine gets the gun back and shoots at Miriam.
Outside, Paul is looking at his watch, finding that Miriam is taking too long to meet him at the helicopter pad.
Mirine tumbles out of the house in ruins, and crawls to Paul's feet.
After her, comes Miriam, poised and controlled as usual, keeping her kicking and punching attack on Mirine, who fights back.
Paul is enjoying the fight, and again calling Miriam ""mama"". Suddenly, a powerful kick sends Miriam against the helicopter's structure, igniting an explosion that blows it - and Miriam - away.
""My sister, why are you against me?"" Paul asks. ""Why?!""
From the helicopter wrecks, Miriam surges, reconstructed, and producing a samurai sword from nowhere. The women fight again, and the quickness of Mirine counters the deadly strikes of the perfect blade.
Then, Mirine disengages from the fight, runs at her brother - who had come closer to better watch the fight - and grabs him by the neck, offering her back to Miriam. Miriam runs at her to impale her through, and Mirine sidesteps just in time for the sword to impale Paul through the stomach to his back.
""Mirine... I love you,"" says Paul dying against Miriam's body.
Miriam steps back, so that Paul's body falls on the floor, and then with a precise strike, she cuts the joint of Mirine's metal bra, which cups fall to the floor, exposing the girl's breasts. Again, Mirine's arches her back a little, firing a number of bullets straight at Miriam's head, disintegrating it.
Miriam's mechanical voice repeats a message implanted in her modified brain long ago, ""Do not fear, nothing to fear"".""Paul, as you said, those who started conflicts should be hated. I'll fight against them,"" says Mirine, getting out of the ruins where Department D was housed. [end credits and inserts of movie scenes]Mirine walks to Department D's main building, holding a metallic cylinder with her,and meets 020's Secretary by the door.
""You've really done it, you deserve to be called a monster,"" the Secretary says.
Without replying, Mirine walks into the building and places the gas cylinder on top of 020's desk. ""I've fetched Dr. Clyne.""
""This?"" asks 020.
""A life-saving device keeps her brain cells alive,"" she explains. ""All the data of Project Faust is in this. My mission is to fetch the ""head"" of the West Bloc, isn't it?""
""I'll report to the commission of investigation, but there are still rules. At least, be prepared for a punishment [returning her her badge and weapon]... 009-1.""
""Bye."" She picks the objects, and turns her back on him.
""And..."" he says, ""It's about Sherry's brother that you took back here. He's been accepted by the facility, and taken good care of.
""To be trained as a future spy?""
""Something's wrong with it?""
""No. It has nothing to do with me.""Alone, 020 calls his superior that 009-1 has turned to be a good agent again, and some day she'll save the world. ""As you planned, Number 0."""

The pigeon flies to the window where nuclear oncologist Dr. Nirupama is in a therapy session as suggested by her friend Bindu. The therapist learns from her that she's unhappy with marriage to her uninteresting and bland husband Vishwanath, who is a dance teacher. Nirupama has recently been in a relationship with her boss Depak, which although having feelings for him also feels guilty about betraying Vishwanath. For this reason under Bindu's advice, she hires a detective named Peter to spy on Viswhanath and find out if he too is having some kind of affair or something else to hide in order to ease her guilt. One night, Vishwanath invites his student Ashmitha Subramaniam, his uncle Jagganath, and his and Jagganath's close friend John Dawkins to brief an unknown mission. Viswhanath confirms that he's somehow aware of Nirupama's affair with Deepak and pretends not to know. Nirupama stays with Deepak at the office late that night and helps him stock up money in his safe, which also contains a gun and thus suggesting caution in his surroundings.The next day Vishwanath and his group do surveillance in the city and Peter follows him after he prays in an Islamic worship place, and the detective discloses this to Nirupama telling him that her husband has hidden his true religion as a Muslim. Viswhanath looses Peter at a trailer complex where he crosses paths with Farukh, a man whom Vishwanath has been tracking for reasons unknown. Farukh becomes suspicious of Peter and kills him. He informs his higher authority Salim, a close friend and partner to the faction's leader Omar Quereshi. They find Peter's diary with information on his clients including Nirupama and that she works for Deepak. Deepak, as instructed by his associates Omar, Salim and Farukh, confronts Nirupama about why she supposedly sent the detective to Farukh. Peter is announced as a murder victim on the news on that night and both Nirupama and Deepak believe Vishwanath has something to do with it, as well as the fact that he lost Peter at the trailer and has hidden that he's Islamic. Deepak calls Farukh and they abduct the couple and take them to a warehouse. Farukh interrogates Vishwanath and demands to know who he is and why he ventured to the trailer park. Vishwanath is uncooperative and seemingly ignorant of the situation, leading to him getting beaten. Under Omar's suspicion and order, Farukh murders Deepak and wonders who Vishwanath really is after Omar seemingly recognizes him from his haunted past. Vishwanath begs Farukh a chance to pray and tricks him into unbinding his hands.Moments after Vishwanath is freed, he gets up and brutally slaughters all the soldiers in the warehouse including Farukh. He and Nirupama escape before Omar and Salim arrive. When the two do arrive, Salim wonders how Vishwanath was possibly able to defeat so many men, and Omar reminds him that he once trained alongside them in the Al Qaeda which Salim remembers. Vishwanath's real name is Wisam Ahmed Kashmiri, an apparent fugitive and traitor of the Indian army who is revered in his fighting skill and persistence and comes to serve as a jihadi under Omar. He becomes close friends with Omar and Salim in Afghanistan at the time and is introduced to the ways of his people, including their dedication to war and the hardships they and their families face during it. He gets to know Omar's family and friends, including the village leader Nasser and a young fellow jihadi Mammu. He also gets to know Kadhija, Omar's wife and Omar's son Nasser(same name as the village leader). Wisam mentors many soldiers and trains them to their extent. Along the way he realizes that families of the soldiers in the group cannot live their lives normally under constant pressure to serve Al Qaeda's cause and attacks by American fronts in the nation. Nasser, Omar's son, wishes to become a doctor inspired by Dr. Glara, who helped Kadhija get better from asthma. Similarly Omar's friend's son Jalal desires to learn engineering and Omar is disappointed in both for having different aspirations than serving Allah. After developing connections to the village, Wisam also comes to know that American forces have been threatening Omar's territory in search of American war hostages that he's keeping. Wisam sees up close the brutality of the soldiers when they murder one of the prisinors. A neighboring village is bombed for it and Omar retaliates by sending Mammu in guise of a woman, carrying bombs to the nearby military base. Mammu kills himself destroying the base, burdening Wisam once more with seeing a young man's life taken.The leaders of the warrior band meet the merchant Thawveeq, a trusted merchant and supplier and good friend of Omar. Thawveeq becomes acquainted with Wisam and gifts him imported opium which he puts away. The next day, Omar, Salim, and Wisam visit Osama Bin Ladin in his hiding place under the village, and at that moment the Americans attack the village. During that time Wisam also meets Munavar who is a spy for the group in Pakistan. The soldiers including head Nasser, Omar, Wisam, and Salim retaliate and fail to defend the civilians from the bombings. The house holding many of them including Jalal, Kadhija, and Nasser(Omar's son) get bombed and the soldiers retreat from the village leaving Wisam behind, who offers to stay behind and see whom he can help. The village leader Nasser also perishes in the attack leading to Omar having to take charge of what remains in the village. In the present, Wisam, Ashmita, Jaganath, and Dawkins preserve their pasts and try to clear confusion to Nirupama. They destroy information devices and drives and evacuate the house when the F.B.I attempts to apprehend them as tipped by Omar for Wisam's history and contribution to the warehouse attacks. Wisam, with little patience has his three friends, sans Dawkins make way to the city to escape the police. Dawkins is sent separately to take guise of Munavar who is tasked to go to an antique shop in order to recover record tapes and prints about a powerful cesium bomb that needs to be planted in the city.Captain Tom Black of the F.B.I arrests Wisam, Nirupama, and Ashmita when they head to the oncology research office. But just before, they find out that Deepak has been supplying Omar and his men with cesium weapons to fulfill their task in a serial bombing in New York. A flashback is seen after Nirupama question's Wisam's past in which it's revealed that Wisam was given a tracking device to lead American forces to Omar's village, thus leading to the air assault. However, Wisam's partner Imtiaz who is also undercover fails to remove it from Thwaveeq's bag where it was placed, leading to him being framed as a spy and beaten and executed, much to Wisam's regret. In the present, the characters confirm that many jihadis including Omar are injured and sick from handling cesium with their bare hands without care. Some patients were resting in the warehouse where they plot to commit a suicide bombing. Wisam, Nirupama, and Ashmita are interrogated by the police who give them a hard time believing they're working with the jihadis, but Jagganath confirms to the leader of the Indian embassy that Wisam is an undercover agent and Tom apologizes. Wisam helps Tom evacuate a school near the warehouse just before the cesium victims bomb the complex, and another bombing takes place at the apartment Omar lived in to divert the police's attention away from a stronger bomb in the middle of the city. As per a plan Omar discussed years prior when Wisam served the Al Qaeda, he attaches pills of cesium to the city's pigeons, killing them and sending radiation detectors haywire. Wisam and Nirupama trace a forgien supply of cesium weaponry to Abasi, a Nigerian customer who works for Omar. Abasi stations himself in an abandoned apartment with a powerful cesium bomb and the F.B.I stake out the complex. They silently infiltrate the building and shoot Abasi before he activates the bomb on Salim's command. Dawkins has obtained the files about the bomb before Munavar but Salim intercepts him and kills him in central park, and he and Omar having finished their work fly to India.Nirupama's knowledge of the bomb allows the police to use a microwave to shield incoming radio waves to prevent cellular detonation. Omar attempts to contact Abasi but Wisam responds on the phone that his plan has failed, leaving Omar and Salim shocked. Wisam is congratulated by the embassy in his work in Afghanistan and ending the assault on New York, and Nirupama believes the battle has been won. But Wisam claims that the war is between him and Omar and one of them must die for that to be true, and the group heads to confront him in India."

Jolly does not lose hope and finds an eye witness but he is reluctant to come to court but tells him to stop searching in New Delhi and search in Gorakhpur where he will find the evidence.The day of the hearing, Jolly questions SI Rathi whether he did the investigation honestly and diligently and asks him to read out loud the names of the 6 who died. Jolly claims that in reality only 5 people died and seeks permission to present the sixth one who apparently died as a witness without prior notice. Rajpal vehemently objects but Judge Tripathi overrules his objections.A Burkha clad Sadakanth Mishra enters the court and recognizes Rahul Dewan as the driver of the Land Cruiser which killed his 5 acquaintances and rendered him a cripple. He also states that SI Rathi left him after taking his yearlong savings of Rs. 30,000 and gold ornaments meant for his sister's wedding. Rajpal asks for a rescheduling but Judge Tripathi does not comply. During the lunch time, SI Tripathi calls Pinky to bring the man he captured, who turns out to be one Ramakanth Sukhla. When the court resumes, Rajpal claims that the police investigation was 'botched' up since it stated that 6 people died in an accident by truck while the prosecution claims that 5 died in an accident by a car. He recommends that the strongest action be taken against SI Rathi as evident from the Prima Facie and questions whether the court should be sending Rahul Dewan to jail on the basis of a botched up investigation. He jokingly adds that foot-paths are not commissioned by Government for sleeping.Jolly, in his submission, agrees with Rajpal that foot-paths are not for sleeping and rhetorically asks why these poor, deprived of work, shelter and food come to tarnish the beauty of the metros. He adds, however, that they do have one right: the right to obtain Justice; one that is given to them by the Constitution of India. Infuriated, Jolly states that if the case lingered any longer, Rajpal would certainly prove that Sadakanth Mishra was Shah Rukh Khan while a train caused the accident, and due to lack of evidence the court would have to comply. He states that foot-paths are not for driving either. This was the 'joke' and he adds that Judge Tripathi's reputation was at stake.Judge Tripathi says that there are two aspects to the case. The first one was that SI Rathi was to be suspended with immediate effect and an investigative process be started against him. The second one was the manipulation of facts, which would be necessary only if Rahul Dewan was guilty. The judge dishearteningly admits that in spite of being fully aware of who committed the crime, he is rendered helpless due to the lack of substantial facts as evidence which are, as evident, prudently kept at bay by the ones whose interests are at stake. He also adds that he was determined to make this one an exception even if it meant exploiting his chair to some extent. He was least bothered to notice whether he would be set free in the impending legal battle.As a result, the court finds Rahul Dewan guilty and sentences him seven years of imprisonment under Indian Penal Code 304. Thus, Jolly wins the case and his self-respect and is congratulated by all and sundry"

They get drunk and pass out, and when they wake up, they find the cops on their heels, blaming them for the disappearance of business magnate Varadarajan.—Shrinivas G. Kulkarni The film opens with a car chase involving cops and two friends, Sugan and Parasuram. As their car jumps from the edge of a flyover, the film starts unfolding in flashback. It is shown that Sugan is a womanizer and this attitude gets him into trouble with his reporter girlfriend Priyanka and the childhood friend Parasu who is unable to get a girlfriend due to Sugan's playboy nature. One day, the duo visits a function for opening a branch of one of their offices, where they meet Varadharajan, the chief guest. In the meantime, a CBI officer Riyaz Ahmed has been deputed to track Varadharajan's illegal activities. Due to some error, Priyanka's paper containing questions for Varadharajan gets misplaced and realizing it's partly his fault, Sugan covers for her by interviewing Varadharajan. He tells everyone about him in detail, which impresses Varadharajan who has no idea Parasu is helping him with all the information via internet and an earpiece. Varadharajan is impressed with Sugan and wants to make him his son-in-law, which gets him into an argument with his elder son-in-law Vijaykrishna.Varadharajan later hosts a cocktail party and invites Sugan who craves biryani after getting drunk and while returning with Parasu, searches for a biryani shop. Finding one, the two stop to eat and Sugan spots an attractive young woman Maya. The two start driving after her and find her car broken down. They decide to give her a ride to her hotel, where she attracts the two men inside, dances with them and gets them drunk. Soon, Varadharajan arrives and it's revealed she's his mistress. Sugan sees him but being heavily drunk, is unable to explain the same to Parasu. The next morning, he wakes up in his car parked outside the Biryani shop and searches for Parasu. He returns to the hotel to find Parasu unconscious with a gun next to him. The duo then find some blood on the bed and as they're trying to flee, cops looking for Varadharajan since his unexpected disappearance nab them. Riyaz meets Vijaykrishna and AC Sampath, Varadharajan's family police officer, and decides to tag along as the latter leaves for the hotel. The cops, on the other hand, try to interrogate the duo, revealing the hotel was booked in Sugan's name and he was caught on camera bringing Varadharajan to the room. Realizing they're being framed, Sugan fights back. A fight ensues, resulting in their escape in the car inside the trunk of which they discover Varadharajan's corpse.Arriving at the crime scene, Sampath and the cops discover the evidence and conclude the friends are the perpetrators. Sugan and Parasu try to think of ways to dispose of the corpse, but run into trouble when the police vehicles chase after them. A huge car chase ensues, during which the two are publicly declared suspects and Varadharajan is considered kidnapped. Near the end of the car chase, the flyover reaches a dead end and their car jumps, leaving behind the cops and escaping. Back to the present time, the duo enlists the help of a friend, and forward Maya's photograph, clicked during her dance, to all their friends. The next day, one friend finds Maya at the Egmore Railway Station, where a female assassin disguised as a cop is ordered to take her out. As she pursues Maya, a flash mob creates public distraction and Sugan takes Maya inside the train, making her reveal she spiked their drinks on the orders of a cop. However, the assassin manages to kill Maya by pushing her in front of a train, and Sugan chases after her. Following a brief hand-to-hand fight, the assassin manages to escape but leaves her phone behind in a rush. Sugan retrieves it and gets it decoded with the help of a friend. They learn she is not a cop but an assassin whose next target is Sugan's sister Varalakshmi. Sugan tries to alert his friend and brother-in-law who are returning from a temple with Varalakshmi. The trio's vehicle is attacked by goons, the men are beaten up badly and Varalakshmi is taken away as Sugan arrives and helplessly chases after the van. However, the goons are ordered to return and get hold of Sugan instead, and this results in another big fight as an enraged Sugan beats up the goons while the assassin flees with the van containing Varalakshmi. Sugan realizes it but in vain. His brother-in-law is admitted to the hospital and somehow manages to survive. Sugan receives a call from Vijaykrishna asking him to hand over Varadharajan in exchange for Varalakshmi's return.Sugan decides to make Parasu impersonate Varadharajan for that to happen. They arrive at the chosen spot, where Sugan and Vijaykrishna start fighting while the assassin fights Sampath. Sugan's friends, lead by Priyanka, discover Varalakshmi and free her along with Riyaz. The plan plays out well when during the fight, Parasu emerges as Varadharajan and fakes his death before telling Viaykrishna he (Parasu) and Sugan are innocent. It is revealed that Vijaykrisha doesn't know anything about Varalakshmi's whereabouts and came because he believes Sugan asked for money in exchange for Varadharajan. Sugan also fights the assassin who is then shot by an officer named ACP Vikram. Sugan and Parasu's names are cleared, but are charged with attacking cops and property. A few days later at Varadharajan's funeral, Sugan learns the truth about Varadharajan's death. Avinash was in love with Varadharajan's daughter for money only, but Sugan and Parasu stopped their love on the way to the new branch opening. Avinash uses his brother to get his love back by bringing Sugan and Parasu using Maya and that Maya used drugs to make Sugan and Parasu very drunk. Then, the assassin comes by killing Maya so that she does not tell the truth to Sugan. Sugan figures out that it was no one other than Vikram, Avinash's brother who was behind everything. Soon Riyaz and Vijaykrishna also find out the truth. Riyaz tells Sugan to kill Vikram, Sugan fights with Vikram, and they both fall from the office into the swimming pool below. What happens to either of them is unknown."

Hunt), finds out that the orc horde he has been leading has attacked a human friary, strictly against his orders.

She informs Keltus that General Drennon (Danny James) keeps a Shadow agent in his outpost's dungeon. Keltus' mission is to question him by any means necessary to get new information.Nemyt enters that outpost just before Keltus. He sees that the elf is cursed and follows her but Nemyt only wants her bounty for Fangtor's head. Drennon dismissively refuses to pay the full amount offering a lesser sum instead. Enraged, Nemyt replies that she should more rather than less for having been cursed and demands a cleric to remove the black sigil. The mark can't be removed, Drennon replies, in fact, she will now be considered a Shadow agent. His men seize her. Nemyt puts up a good fight but is finally knocked out and put into jail.Keltus now enters Drennon's office and they discuss the problem that dwarves, and now even elves, are being drafted into the Shadow Cabal.

He becomes impressed that an elf is now a part of the Cabal. He confides in her, revealing that if she is able to get free she must retrieve a box of gold and take it to Garret's Crossing at a specific time. There she must exchange the gold with Kullimon's raiders for the sacred vessel, an artifact the Shadow is seeking. Nemyt asks where she can find the gold and Maggut tells her that she can find it close to the bleeding stone. She must also collect the blood from the altar but only at dawn. When Nemyt asks, where the bleeding stone is Maggut becomes suspicious that maybe the elf is a spy. As a Shadow agent Nemyt should already know the place. Maggut tries to kill her, but he is no match for the huntress.Keltus enters the cell and finds Maggut's body and asks Nemyt if Maggut spoke before he died, but the elf refuses any answer. Changing his tactics he takes her into his custody by authority of the prophetess. The duo is stopped by a veiled woman (Eve Mauro) with a handcart as they prepare to leave. The woman tells Keltus that death is upon him, that a hero is known by his deeds but is judged by his heart. She asks him who his heart belongs to and leaves.Once in the wilderness Keltus takes off Nemyt's handcuffs,but the elf attacks knight immediately. To quiet her, Keltus assures Nemyt that a priestess of the Order will remove the mark IF Nemyt is willing to help him infiltrate the Shadow. Knowing that the mark will kill her at some point, she agrees and tells Keltus, that they have to go the bleedng stone.On the way Keltus learns that Nemyt is a high elf of the GaruunDan, who survived the Orc Wars as a child.explaining her violent hatred of orcs. Crossing forest they discover Kullimon tied to a cross but still alive. The elf wants to kill him, but Keltus stops her and frees the Orc in exchange for information. Kullimon tells them that Mulgrut has attacked a monastery of mendicants to steal the bone-vessel for the Shadow. The artifact contains the holy ashes of Amun-Khan. Disbelieving, Keltus asks for the place of the exchange. Kullimon offers to take them there to get his revenge on Malgrut, but Nemyt reveal the place and time--Garret's Crossing at new moon. Kullimon notices the elf's mark of the elf, refuses accompany them any longer inciting Nemyt to attack him. The fight ends in a draw. Keltus, acting as mediator, gets them to agree to work together for the common good.Together they reach the Bleeding Stone, an ancient meeting place for warlocks. Nemyt tells the others that she is supposed to collect the blood dripping from it. Kullimon thinks that it must be important for the Shadow. Keltus decides they might need the blood at some point of their mission. While they wait Nemyt sneaks away to collect Maggut's gold, hidden close by. In her absence a horde of undead and an Abomination attack her two companions, wounding Keltus. They are outnumbered and held by the hulking monster. Upon Nemyt's return the undead stop fighting, recognizing her as one of them. Kullimon takes advantage of the respite and kills the monster. Nemyt kills all the rest.Keltus discovers the gold, enraging the elf again. She asks, if the prophetess will really able to help her. Keltus affirms his previous statement, calming Nemyt. He sees that she is beginning to change. They collect the blood and leave to Garret's Crossing.Kullimon expresses the thought that Nemyt must be evil since she was cursed and the Shadow can only claim souls, which are filled with murder and hatred. But Keltus defends Nemyt. He tells the orc about Fangtor's fate, his curse for Nemyt and also that Nemyt is a child of the GaruunDan. Kullimon understands, and is also thankful, that she killed the shaman, since Fangtor turned Malgrut evil.At Garret's Crossing they wait for Malgrut's orcs, who should bring them the bone-vessel. Keltus wants Nemyt to pretend that she is the Shadow agent, who is buying the vessel with Maggut's gold. After the exchange the Order should destroy the bone-vessel. Without the two others knowing Keltus prays again to his prophetess to report his findings and his plan. He tells the prophetess that he promised, that a priestess of the Order will remove Nemyt's mark. The prophetess disagrees and orders Keltus to kill Nemyt, when she gets useless. As a murderer and servant of Goth Azul she has to die. Keltus agrees.
When the orcs arrive, Nemyt meets them at the crossing. Mulgrut is sceptical, but the elf can persuade him with the gold and her sword to make the exchange. Just when she is leaving, the real Shadow agent appears, and the orcs stop Nemyt, wounding her seriously. The agent takes the vessel, curses the orcs and tells them to come to the Dimwood pass. Then he leaves. Mulgrut is happy about being immortal now and serving the Shadow. The orcs leave for the Dimwood pass together with the injured and captivated Nemyt.
Keltus decides to follow the agent for the vessel, while Kullimon wants to follow the orcs. The orc is disapointed, that Keltus is leaving Nemyt to a terrible fate after she did her part to help him. Keltus excuses his behaviour with his responsibility to the prophetess.Keltus can catch up with the Shadow agent, who tells the knight, that he will belong to Goth Azul, since his soul is empty. Keltus wants the vessel back and attacks the agent. He loses and is stabbed. In addition he is cursed with the mark and unable to attack the agent any longer, since his faith is too weak. The agent goes away with the blood and the vessel, leaving Keltus to die and to become an undead servant of Goth Azul. Keltus prays to his prophetess to save him, but she and their goddess turn him down and forget him.Meanwhile Kullimon gets closer to Mulgrut's horde. He has to cross a lake and is nearly killed by evil mermaids. Mulgrut's horde is taking a break, and Mulgrut wants to abuse and torture the captive Nemyt. Kullimon arrives just in time, challenges Mulgrut and kills his former captain. He refuses the cursed horde, and tells them that his revenge is now complete. Mulgrut suddenly comes back to life. As a shadow warrior he can't be killed, he explains. Kullimons frees Nemyt and wants to leave. But the elf wants her sword, takes a knife from Kullimon and runs to the horde. She stabs Kethku (James Gaisford), Malgrut's captain, several times insanely, since that orc hurt her badly at Garret's Crossing and also intended to abuse her. She gets to her sword, kills many more orcs and leaves with a bewildered Kullimon. During their escape she is shot in the back, but Kullimon carries her and they can escape.Keltus is dying. The veiled woman with the handcart approaches him and tells him that he is now so very alone with an empty heart. She drops her cloak and reveals that she is a prophetess of the goddess Tarsa or even Tarsa herself, the god of light. She explains Keltus, that she is his oldest and only friend, that she has been watching and judging him, but that he is unable to defeat Goth Azul. She claims Keltus as her own and explains that Goth Azul has no power over the living. She takes his arm and enchants him.Kullimon is taking care of Nemyt's wound, while she is unconcious. She awakes and is disappointed that Keltus is not there. Kullimon admires Nemyt's resistance to the curse and is sad, that his men are lost to the Shadow. Nemyt offends the other orcs again, but she admits, that not all of them seem to be bad. She thanks Kullimon for saving her and wants to go after the Shadow. Kullimon insists on helping her.On their way to Dimwood Pass they are ambushed by the dwarf Gyarmuck, who did not die in the explosion during his fight with Keltus. Nemyt and Kullimon are not able to defeat the heavily armed dwarf. Nemyt is nearly killed and unconcious, while Kullimon is defenseless. The dwarf wants to kill Kullimon, but is beheaded by Keltus. Keltus heals Nemyt's wounds with his magic given by Tarsa. He admits, that he was wrong about her, and that he lied, when he said, that her mark can be healed. Nemyt does not get angry and promises to resist the curse as long as possible. Keltus explains, that when the Shadow mixes the ashes and the blood at the pit of demons, an entrance to the underworld, an avatar of Goth Azul will arise to lead an unstoppable undead army. Nemyt leads the trio to the pit for their final battle. The elf notices that Keltus has changed, and he confesses that he now follows Tarsa and shows his new mark of light. Nemyt gets hurt by the sight, but Keltus tells her that there is still hope for her to be healed.At the pit of demons they decide a suicide mission to stop the ritual. While Kullimon and Keltus should distract the horde, Nemyt should approach the Shadow agents and steal the ashes or the blood to stop the ceremony. Nemyt wants Keltus to swear to kill her, if the curse overtakes her. Nemyt and Kullimon shake hands. She tells Kullimon that her vengeance on the orc kind is satisfied. She is happy that she did not kill him and leaves for the pit.
Nemyt is able to get close to the agents and the ceremony. Mulgruts detects her, when Kullimon and Keltus start their attack. The elf leaves her cover and wants to attack the agents, but the main agent is able to intensify her curse and orders the elf to commit suicide with her own sword. Suprisingly she is still strong enough to resist, but is shot by Mulgrut in her side. The ceremony continues and the blood is spilled into the pit. Mulgrut tortures Nemyt again, but Kullimon can get Mulgrut away from her. Nemyt gets angry again, pulls out the bolt and starts killing the agents in the ceremony. While Keltus is still fighting the horde, Kullimon cuts of Mulgrut's head, killing him once and for all. In the meantime Nemyt got to the final main Shadow agent and forces her sword into his head. In death the agent pulls the sword out, strikes Nemyt seriously and falls into the pit together with the ashes.
The remaining horde stops attacking, and Kullimon helps Nemyt. She tells him that she failed, but the Orc calms her down and tells her that it is now Keltus' turn.
The avatar of Goth Azul rises and starts killing everyone with a large black spear of shadow. Keltus stabs the monster with his sword but without effect. The avatar sends another spear after Keltus but misses. The knight picks up the spear and with Tarsa's magic it turns into a spear of light. Keltus throws the spear right into Goth Azul's chest and destroys the monster.
Keltus finds Nemyt and Kullimon and notices that Nemyt's marks is gone and that she is now free. Nemyt dies in Kullimon's arms. Keltus prays to Tarsa to give Nemyt back, and the elf comes back to life. Nemyt picks up Mulgrut's gold and they leave the battlefield, discussing how to split the money,"
