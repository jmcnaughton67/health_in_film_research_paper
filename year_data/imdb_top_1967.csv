The Jungle Book,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061852/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Bagheera the Panther and Baloo the Bear have a difficult time trying to convince a boy to leave the jungle for human civilization. Abandoned after an accident, baby Mowgli is taken and raised by a family of wolves. As the boy grows older, the wise panther Bagheera realizes he must be returned to his own kind in the nearby man-village. Baloo the bear, however, thinks differently, taking the young Mowgli under his wing and teaching him that living in the jungle is the best life there is. Bagheera realizes that Mowgli is in danger, particularly from Shere Khan the tiger who hates all people. When Baloo finally comes around, Mowgli runs off into the jungle where he survives a second encounter with Kaa the snake and finally, with Shere Khan. It's the sight of a pretty girl, however, that draws Mowgli to the nearby man-village and stay there.—garykmcd Based on Rudyard Kipling's book, Disney's ""The Jungle Book"", tells the story of how a young boy named Mowgli was raised by a pack of wolves, the young man-cub has adapted into the jungle and its surroundings quite well. Bagheera, a wise panther, must take Mowgli to the man-village to ensure his protection from the treacherous tiger, Shere Khan who wants to kill the boy in an effort to maintain balance within the jungle. Mowgli isn't ready to leave his home just yet and a fun-loving sloth bear named Baloo takes the man cub under his wing, but it proves to be an adventure for him and his best friend. Mowgli encounters King Louie, who wants to know how to make fire from the man-cub and he has a run in with Kaa, a hungry python who wants to eat the young man-cub. Mowgli must decide wether he belongs in the jungle or the man-village.—dawsonpersi Disney animation inspired by Rudyard Kipling's ""Mowgli"" story. Mowgli is a boy who has been raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. When the wolves hear that the fierce tiger, Shere Khan, is nearby, they decide to send Mowgli to a local ""man-village"". On his way to the village, Mowgli meets many animal characters in this musical tale. When Shere Khan learns of Mowgli's presence, he tracks him down.—Rob Hartill The story of ""The Jungle Book"" concerns a young man-cub named Mowgli. A panther named Bagheera one day comes across an abandoned boat, in which a small baby is seen. Taking pity on the baby, Bagheera takes it to a small family of wolves, who adopt the boy.10 years pass, and Mowgli has grown into a wiry young boy, who has long since been adopted into his wolf pack, despite his differences. However, word has reached the pack that the tiger Shere Khan has been spotted in the jungle. The pack knows of Khan's hatred of man, and wish to send Mowgli away for protection. Bagheera volunteers to take Mowgli to a man-village some distance away.Mowgli and Bagheera set out sometime after dark. They stay in a tree for the night, but are disturbed by Kaa, a python with a hypnotic gaze, who tries to hypnotize both of them, before being pushed out of the tree by Mowgli.The next day, they are awakened by 'The Dawn Patrol,' a pack of elephants led by Colonel Hathi. Mowgli spends a few moments with their son, who one day dreams of following in his Father's footsteps. Bagheera orders Mowgli to continue on their way to the man-village, but Mowgli refuses. After some struggles, Bagheera and Mowgli separate, fed up with the other's company.As Mowgli sulks by a rock, he is suddenly discovered by Baloo, a large bear with a care-free attitude. Bagheera hears the commotion caused by the two of them, and returns, dismayed that Mowgli has encountered the 'jungle bum.' Baloo's 'philosophy' of living care-free in the jungle easily takes hold of the young man-cub, and Mowgli now wishes to stay with Baloo. However, a group of monkeys suddenly appear, and take Mowgli away.Mowgli is taken to some ancient ruins, lorded over by an orangutan named King Louie, who figures since Mowgli is a man-cub, he can help him learn how to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo show up shortly, and after a fierce chase, get Mowgli away from King Louie.As Mowgli rests from the ordeal, Bagheera explains to Baloo why Mowgli must leave the jungle, and after telling Baloo of the danger that Shere Khan poses to him, Baloo reluctantly agrees to take Mowgli back, even though he had promised Mowgli he could stay in the jungle with him. When Mowgli finds out about this, he runs off again.After some time going through the jungle, Mowgli encounters Kaa, who hypnotizes the boy. Kaa is just about to eat Mowgli, when he is alerted to Shere Khan. Kaa manages to carry on a conversation with the tiger, and just barely hides the fact that the man-cub is nearby. Once Shere Khan leaves, Kaa's plans to eat Mowgli are foiled when Mowgli comes out of his trance, and is able to escape.Sometime afterward, Mowgli chances upon a group of vultures, who are willing to take him in as one of their own. However, before they can do so, Shere Khan appears. Even though he is feared by the vultures, Mowgli refuses to run. Just as it seems that Shere Khan may devour Mowgli, Baloo appears, and wrestles with the tiger, who ends up clawing at the large bear. In the ensuing chaos, Mowgli ties a flaming branch to Shere Khan's tail, and the fire spooks the tiger, sending him running away.Just when it appears that Baloo has died, he recovers from the ordeal. Bagheera soon joins the group, and the three of them set off back through the jungle.It seems that Bagheera's plan to get Mowgli to the man-village has failed, when a beautiful song wafts through their ears. As the three of them look through some bushes, they see the man-village, and by a small stream, a little girl appears, gathering water. This intrigues Mowgli, who tries to go for a closer look. Seeing the boy, the girl pretends to spill her water jug. Mowgli retrieves it, refills it, but instead of taking it, the girl leads him back to the man-village, humming her 'siren song.' Baloo whispers for Mowgli to come back, but the boy follows the girl into the village.Bagheera happily explains that Mowgli is now where he belongs, and Baloo accepts this fact, before wrapping an arm around the panther, and the two of them return to the jungle."
The Graduate,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A disillusioned college graduate finds himself torn between his older lover and her daughter. Benjamin Braddock returns home to California after successfully completing college. He gets a hero's welcome from his parents but Ben isn't quite sure what to do with the rest of his life. He is soon seduced by Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's partner, who methodically pursues the inexperienced young man. Soon, they are meeting regularly in hotel rooms. Warned by her to stay away from her daughter Elaine, his father goads him into taking her out on a date. He finds he quite likes Elaine but when she learns he's been having an affair with her own mother, she'll have nothing to do with him. He's smitten however and pursues her.—garykmcd After a successful stint away at an eastern college, twenty-one year old Benjamin Braddock returns to his parents' Los Angeles area home a graduate. Although the world should be his oyster, Ben is instead in a state of extreme anxiety as he has no idea what to do with his life, which is made all the more difficult since everybody asks him what he plans on doing or tells him what he should do. In his confused state during which he would rather be alone to wallow in self-pity, he is easy prey for the aggressive Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner who he's known all his life and who seduces him. Thinking about and then eventually succumbing to her advances only adds to his anxiety and confusion as he hides what they're doing from the rest of the world, and as he needs more than just sex in a relationship, sex which is all she wants from him. His confusion is lessened but his life becomes more complicated when he is reacquainted with Elaine Robinson, the Robinsons' daughter who too is home from college at Berkeley and who he has not seen since high school. Despite a rocky start directed largely by the wants of Mrs. Robinson, Ben and Elaine start to fall for each other. In this complicated situation, Ben has to try to figure out how at least to start to strive for what he believes should be that successful post-graduate life.—Huggo Benjamin Braddock has just finished college and, back at his parents' house, he's trying to avoid the one question everyone keeps asking: What does he want to do with his life? An unexpected diversion crops up when he is seduced by Mrs. Robinson, a bored housewife and friend of his parents. But what begins as a fun tryst turns complicated when Benjamin falls for the one woman Mrs. Robinson demanded he stay away from, her daughter, Elaine.—Jwelch5742 During a party given by his parents to celebrate his graduation, Benjamin Braddock (Hoffman) is seduced by Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), the wife of one of his father's closest friends. They have an affair, but Benjamin then falls in love with her daughter, Elaine (Ross). Jealous and angry, Mrs. Robinson does everything to keep the young couple apart. The film explores the life of 21-year-old Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) shortly after earning his bachelor's degree from an unnamed college in the Northeast. The school is widely believed to be Williams College, Webb's alma mater (in the opening sequence of the movie, Dustin Hoffman, playing Benjamin Braddock, is wearing a Williams College tie). Benjamin is seen arriving at LAX International Airport over the opening credits.The movie really begins at a party that same evening celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles. Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by his parents' friends. He remains aloof while his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. Benjamin escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the neglected wife of his father's law partner, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he reluctantly does. We never learn Mrs. Robinson's first name (or, indeed, the first names of any of Benjamin's and Elaine's parents) during the course of the film (in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs. Robinson's first name is G).Arriving at her home, she pleads for Benjamin to come inside, saying that she doesn't like to enter a dark house alone. Once inside, she forces a drink on him, and later exposes herself to him offering to have an affair with him. This scene, known as the ""Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me"" scene, as said by Benjamin, is said to be one of the most iconic scenes in the film. She, for no clear reason, does attempt to seduce him, removing her clothing. Mr. Robinson arrives home a few minute later, but does not see or suspect anything. Initially flustered and shocked by her advances, Benjamin flees into the night.A few days later Benjamin contacts Mrs. Robinson and clumsily organizes a tryst at a hotel beginning their affair. A now confident and relaxed Benjamin spends the summer drifting around in the pool by day and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. Benjamin is clearly uncomfortable with sexuality, but he is drawn into the affair with the older, but still attractive, Mrs. Robinson. Their affair appears to last most of the summer. All of their scenes pass in a musically-backed montage, showing the endless pass of time. One scene is edited so that it appears Benjamin is walking directly from his parents' dining room into the hotel room he shares with Mrs. Robinson. This seems to accent the separation of he and his parents, though they still live under the same roof. Benjamin discovers that they have nothing to talk about but, she refuses to talk and only wants sex. After pestering her one evening, Mrs. Robinson tells Benjamin that she was forced to give up college and marry someone she didn't love when she became pregnant with her daughter Elaine.Meanwhile, Benjamin is hounded by his father to select a graduate school to attend. Benjamin, clearly not interested in pursuing his studies, shrugs off his father's wishes and spends his time lounging about and sleeping with Mrs. Robinson. His affair may serve as an escape from his lack of direction or ambition, and his fear and anxiety of his impending future. Mr. Robinson, unaware of his wife's budding affair, encourages Benjamin to call on his daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross). Benjamin's parents also repeatedly encourage him to date her. During one liaison, Mrs. Robinson forces a promise from Ben to never date Elaine. Whether out of fear of Mrs. Robinson, or sensing that getting involved with the daughter of his lover could be disastrous, he tries to avoid it. However, because of the three parents' persistent intervention, he is essentially forced to date her.Therefore, he tries to ensure his date with her will be a disaster so she would not want to pursue a relationship with him. He drives recklessly, practically ignoring Elaine, and then takes her to a strip club where she is openly humiliated and silently begins to cry. After making her cry he relents and explains he was mean only because his parents forced him to ask her out. He awkwardly kisses her to try and cheer her up and they go and get a burger at a drive-in. Benjamin discovers that Elaine is someone he is comfortable with and that he can talk to her about his worries.From here, Benjamin's life falls apart. The jealous Mrs. Robinson threatens to reveal their affair to destroy any chance Benjamin has with Elaine, so Benjamin rashly decides he has to tell Elaine first. Upset over hearing about Benjamin's tryst with her mother, Elaine returns to Berkeley refusing to speak with Benjamin.Benjamin decides he is going to marry Elaine in order to have a future with her and goes to Berkeley where he rents a room in a local flop house, and begins to stalk her. He contrives a meeting on a bus while she is on her way to a date with her classmate Carl. The next day, an angry Elaine bursts into Benjamin's room and demands to know what he is doing in Berkeley after he ""raped"" her mother by taking advantage of her while she was drunk that evening of his graduation party. Shocked by what Elaine said, Benjamin tells her it was her mother who seduced him that night, but Elaine refuses to believe him and doesn't want to hear the fact that her mother is a crafty vixen. Benjamin says he will leave Berkeley and go somewhere else for her sake. Elaine tells Benjamin not to leave until he has a definite plan at what he wants to do with his life.The next day, Elaine comes into Ben's apartment in the middle of the night and asks him to kiss her. Over the next few days, the two hang out in Berkeley while Benjamin keeps pressing her to get blood tests so that they can get married. Elaine is unsure about this and tells him she had told Carl she might marry him.Mr. Robinson, who has found out everything about Benjamin and his wife's affair, goes to Ben's apartment in Berkeley where he threatens Benjamin with violence and forces Elaine to drop out of school and takes her away to marry Carl. Benjamin tells Mr. Robinson that his wife is the bad person and she manipulated him into having an affair with her. But Mr. Robinson also is skeptic and refuses to belive Benjamin. Benjamin is left with just a note from Elaine saying that she loves him but that her father is really angry and it can never work out.Benjamin drives back to Pasadena and arrives at the Robinson house that evening looking for Elaine. After getting no response by knocking on the front door, goes around to the back of the house and forces open a screen door. Benjamin quickly sees that Elaine is not there, but finds Mrs. Robinson instead. She coldly tells him he won't be able stop Elaine and Carl's wedding and she immediately calls the police and play-acts by claiming that a man broke into her house and is assaulting her. Finally seeing the sociopath that Mrs. Robinson really is, Benjamin flees and drives back to Berkeley to hide out there.The next morning, Benjamin goes to the Delta Chi Fraternity house to look for Elaine or Carl where he learns from Carl's frat brothers that the wedding is in Santa Barbara that very morning. Benjamin then speeds off towards Santa Barbara, stopping only at a gas station to ask for directions to the church. Benjamin is in such a hurry that he rushes off without refueling.Consequently, Ben runs out of gas and must sprint the last few blocks. He arrives at the church just as the bride and groom are about to kiss. Thinking he is too late, he bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams out ""Elaine!"" repeatedly. Elaine turns around, hesitates by looking at her parents and her would-be husband, but then screams out ""Ben!"" and starts running towards him. A brawl breaks out as everyone tries to stop her and Benjamin from leaving. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who claims ""It's too late!"" for Elaine apparently already said her marriage vows, to which Elaine replies, ""Not for me!"" Benjamin holds everybody off by swinging a cross ripped from the wall, then using it to jam the outside door while the pair escape. They run down the road and flag down a bus. The elated and smiling couple take the back seat. But in the final shot, Benjamin's smile gradually fades to an enigmatic, neutral expression as he gazes forward down the bus, not looking at Elaine. Elaine also seems unsure, looks lovingly across at Ben but notices his expression and turns away with a similar expression as the bus drives away, taking the two lovers to an uncertain future."
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061735/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A couple's attitudes are challenged when their daughter introduces them to her African-American fiancé. After a vacation in Hawaii, Joanna ""Joey"" Drayton returns to her parents' home in San Francisco bringing her fiancé, the highly-qualified Dr. John Prentice, to introduce him to her parents. Her mother, Christina Drayton, owns an art gallery and her father, Matt Drayton, is the publisher-editor of the newspaper, The Guardian. Joey was raised with a liberal education and intends to marry Dr. John Prentice, a Black widower who needs to fly to Geneva that evening to work with the World Health Organization. Joey invites John's parents to have dinner with her family and the couple flies from Los Angeles to San Francisco without knowing that Joey is white. Christina also invites the liberal Monsignor Ryan, who is a friend of her family. Throughout the day and evening, the families discuss the problems of their son and daughter.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil When Joanna Drayton, a free-thinking white woman, and black doctor John Prentice become engaged, they travel to San Francisco to meet her parents. Matt Drayton and his wife Christina are wealthy liberals who must confront the latent racism the coming marriage arouses. Also attending the Draytons' dinner are Prentice's parents, who vehemently disapprove of the relationship.—Jwelch5742 After a ten-day Hawaiian vacation, Joanna Drayton (Houghton) returns to her San Francisco home with John Prentice (Poitier), her brand-new fiance. Although he's a successful doctor, her parents, Christina (Hepburn) and Matthew (Tracy), are taken aback when they discover John is Black. While he quickly wins over Christina with his charm and intelligence, Matthew is more hesitant. Joey Drayton brings her fiancé, Dr. John Prentice, home to sunny San Francisco to meet her affluent parents. Their liberal persuasions are now put to the test. The young man is an ideal choice - he's highly and internationally respected in the medical field, impeccably mannered, handsome, well dressed, and of a respectable California family - except he's Black. The film, which covers one busy day in the Drayton home, is essentially a drawing-room comedy, a series of cross-conversations between the young doctor and the girl's parents, and finally between all sets of parents and offspring. A simple dinner invitation is extended the doctor's parents, who fly up from Los Angeles for the evening, and the crusty but benevolent old Irish priest, a friend of the family. Thus, the title of the film . . .—filmfactsman The movie concerns Joanna Drayton, a young white American woman (Houghton) and a man with whom she's had a whirlwind romance, Dr. Prentice (Poitier), an African American she met while on a holiday in Hawaii. As the movie opens, they're at the San Francisco Airport preparing to tell her parents, Matthew (Tracy) and Christine (Hepburn) Dayton their plans: to marry and live in Switzerland.Kramer and Rose intentionally debunked ethnic stereotypes; the young doctor was purposely created idealistically perfect so that the only possible objection to his marrying Joanna would be his race, or the fact she only met him nine days earlier. He has graduated from a top school, begun innovative medical initiatives in Africa, refused to have premarital sex with his fiancée despite her request, and leaves money on his future father-in-law's desk in payment for a long distance phone call he has made.The plot is centered on Joanna's return to her liberal upper class home overlooking the San Francisco Bay. Her mother, while surprised, is supportive from the beginning, but her father isn't buying the marriage. He is joined in his concerns by the family retainer Tillie (Sanford) and the young Doctor's father (Glenn), a retired postal worker who flies up to Los Angeles for dinner.The action builds to a stirring speech by the father (the last by Tracy on film) in which Matthew Drayton comes to grips with the differences between his daughter and his future son-in-law and makes clear that what others think of the marriage of Joanna and Prentice means nothing, all that matters is that the two young people love each other and that the real crime would be if they allowed outside criticism to deny them their mutual love.His words move his wife to tears, and after allowing the weight of his words to sink in, Matthew breaks the ice by demanding to know when dinner will be served."
The Dirty Dozen,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061578/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During World War II, a rebellious U.S. Army Major is assigned a dozen convicted murderers to train and lead them into a mass assassination mission of German officers. A Major with an attitude problem and a history of getting things done is told to interview military prisoners with death sentences or long terms for a dangerous mission; To parachute behind enemy lines and cause havoc for the German Generals at a rest house on the eve of D-Day.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> US army Major John Reisman, based in London, is an inventive man who often thinks outside the box which causes many problems in the structured military. But it is because of this mentality that in March 1944, he is assigned, or as his superiors put it volunteers for a near suicide mission. Prior to the Allied forces invading continental Europe, he and his team, who he will train personally with Sergeant Bowren as his second in command, will infiltrate a highly fortified and guarded French château being used by the Nazis as respite house and meeting place primarily for high ranking German officers, kill as many of the officers as possible and take out the communications tower. His squad will consist of twelve of the most heavily sentenced GI convicts, many whose sentence is death. Reisman, who doesn't like the assignment because of the involvement of the convicts, adds one caveat to doing this job: that the convicts have their sentences commuted if they survive. Reisman quickly learns that besides a resentment to authority, the twelve convicts are a disparate group, each with their own button issues and motivations. Reisman not only has to get them to cooperate, but work as a team, which includes having a zero tolerance policy for the group as a whole on issues such as escape attempts while under his command. Even if he can achieve these goals, Reisman also faces the obstacle of Colonel Everett Breed, who is the antithesis of Reisman and who will be at the parachute training base at the same time as Reisman's squad, for which Breed has disdain.—Huggo During the World War II, Major Reisman is a tough and efficient military with problems with his superiors. He is assigned by General Worden for an almost impossible top secret suicide mission: to kill as much senior German officers as possible in a retreat on the eve of the D-Day. He must train twelve undisciplined convicted soldiers, most of them sentenced to death, to accomplish the mission. He joins the twelve men under the positive leadership of Joseph Wladislaw and the negative leadership of the insubordinate Victor Franko and tries to form a team with the support of Sergeant Bowren. He makes General Worden to promise to release them all if they are well succeeded. Meanwhile his enemy Colonel Everett Dasher Breed tries to make his life more difficult but Reisman and his twelve men need to prove that they are efficient.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil It is 1944 and the Allied Armies stand ready for a major invasion of Germany from bases in England. As a prelude to D-Day, US Army Intelligence orders a top secret mission where convicted criminals will be offered a pardon in return for parachuting into the Reich on a suicide mission.—Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> WWII Army Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) has a history of bucking authority, including that of his former commander Col. Breed (Robert Ryan). Now under the authority of General Worden (Ernest Borgnine), Reisman is asked to lead a commando unit. Their mission: a stealth attack on a posh vacation chateau for Wehrmacht officers in occupied France, in hopes of disrupting German command before an Allied invasion.It's essentially a suicide mission, and the proposed soldiers are bizarre. After reviewing their qualifications, their crime history, and an interview, twelve military convicts sentenced to death or life prison terms are asked to volunteer in return for full pardons. The convicts include Wladislaw (Charles Bronson), a German-speaking former officer who attacked a superior rather than follow a stupid order, black activist Jefferson (Jim Brown), gangster Franko (John Cassavetes), psychopath Maggott (Telly Savalas), and mentally slow Pinkley (Donald Sutherland).With the aid of Sergeant Bowren (Richard Jaeckel), the men are taken to a heavily guarded remote camp for training. Nonconformists by nature, Reisman must resort to harsh discipline and incentives to motivate the uncooperative group. When Reisman deprives them of warm water for shaving, Bowren labels them, ""the Dirty Dozen"". As time passes, they finally begin to learn how to work together as a group.As a reward, Reisman brings in a group of local hookers for a party for the men, isolating the misogynist Maggott in the guard tower for safety. When Colonel Breed finds out about this breach of regulations, he demands that Reisman's unit ""prove themselves"". Arrangements are made for them to participate in a local war game. Major Max Armbruster (George Kennedy) is assigned to monitor them, and is impressed by their ingenuity in avoiding capture and ""thinking outside the box"" in order to achieve their objective.Training for their mission commences in earnest. Rather than having complex instructions that the men might not remember, Reisman develops a chant for them all to memorize each part of the attack plant. ""One: down to the road block, we've just begun; Two: the guards are through; Three: the Major's men are on a spree; Four: Major and Wladislaw go through the door; Five: Pinkley stays out in the drive; Six: the Major gives the rope a fix; Seven: Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven; Eight: Jiménez has got a date; Nine: the other guys go up the line; Ten: Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen; Eleven: Posey guards points five and seven; Twelve: Wladislaw and the Major go down to delve; Thirteen: Franko goes up without being seen; Fourteen: Zero-hour, Jiménez cuts the cable, Franko cuts the phone; Fifteen: Franko goes in where the others have been; Sixteen: we all come out like it's Halloween."" The group recites this constantly to drive it into their minds.When they parachute into France, Jiminez (Trini López) dies on impact. The plan proceeds as planned ... until a lone woman brings out Maggot's inner demons. He tells her to scream, then stabs her, then starts shooting, alerting the Germans to the attack. Gilpin's (Ben Carruthers) leg gets trapped as the roof gives way, forcing him to sacrifice his life in order to explode the antenna tower. The Germans run to an underground bomb shelter, disrupting the original plan. Reisman and Wladislaw lock the victims inside and pour gasoline in the air vents, and Jefferson throws live grenades in afterwards.Germans have been picking off the convicts one by one the entire time, and now only four are left. As Franko exclaims that they've made it, he is shot. Reisman, Wladislaw, and Sgt. Bowren escape with their lives.Back in Allied territory, General Worden decrees that the dead convicts will be listed as soldiers who gave their lives honorably in the line of duty."
Valley of the Dolls,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062430/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Film version ofJacqueline Susann's best-selling novel chronicling the rise and fall of three young women in show business. Anne Welles, a bright, brash young New England college grad leaves her Peyton Place-ish small town and heads for Broadway, where she hopes to find an exciting job and sophisticated men. During her misadventures in Manhattan and, later, Hollywood, she shares experiences with two other young hopefuls: Jennifer North, a statuesque, Monroe-ish actress who wants to be accepted as a human being, but is regarded as a sex object by all the men she meets, and Neely O'Hara, a talented young actress who's accused of using devious means by a great older star (Helen Lawson) to reach the top, pulling an ""All About Eve""-type deception in order to steal a good role away from her.—filmfactsman The film opens with a voice-over narration from Anne Welles (Barbara Parkins). She reveals how she started a journey toward success by leaving her small New England town for New York City. When she gets to the city, she takes a work assignment with a talent agency, and immediately she starts to discover the harsh realities of show business. The agency sends her to a local theater to deliver contracts to renowned performer Helen Lawson (Susan Hayward). Helen's agent warns Anne not to let her guard down around Helen, and Helen's abrasiveness shocks Anne, who was expecting Helen to be true to her glamorous image. Instead, Helen is tough talking, uses vulgar language, and Anne's idle chatter with Helen sparks a terrible reaction and she sees first hand the evil and selfish woman that Helen really is. When Anne comments that a young woman singing down the hall is very good, Helen agrees, and immediately decides to have the girl fired from the show because the egotistical Helen fears being upstaged. Helen sends Anne back to the office with the contracts in shreds, threatening to leave the agency if Anne's boss doesn't get rid of the competition.The young girl that Helen sees as her rival is Neely O'Hara (Patty Duke), a talented up-and-coming singer. She is distraught when she finds out that her musical number has been cut from the show. Since all that remains for her is just a few lines of dialogue, she decides to leave the show all together. Also part of the show is a lovely showgirl named Jennifer North (Sharon Tate), who sympathizes with Neely when she's cut from the show.When Anne returns to the office to give the news about Helen (whom Anne now refers to as an ""evil queen bitch""), she instead finds the agency's younger partner, Lyon Burke (Paul Burke). Burke and Anne are immediately attracted to one another, and when Anne tells Lyon that she wants to leave the agency after her frightening brush with the mean-spirited Helen, Lyon persuades her to stay. Pulling some strings for Anne's new friend, Lyon sets up Neely to appear on a popular telethon, where she is immediately noticed. Neely and her boyfriend, Mel (Martin Milner), live in a humble apartment in New York, but after her career takes off they are married. Neely's popularity skyrockets and her demanding schedule for concerts and singing gigs leads her to start taking pills. Neely first takes caffeine pills to wake her up in the morning as well as amphetamines keep her going during the day, then takes downers to help get to sleep at night.Anne and Lyon embark on a tenuous affair. Anne seems shy about spending the night with Lyon, and she brings up the idea of marriage. Lyon firmly declares himself a bachelor, however, and does not approve of the idea of marriage. When Anne's mother dies, she goes back to her home town to mourn, and Lyon joins her there later. They have a moment of reckoning; Anne makes it clear that she feels cheap for being sexually involved with Lyon knowing that he will never marry her. Lyon leaves a farewell letter for Anne the next day, telling her that he can no longer see her. Simultaneously, Anne gets a sudden opportunity to model for a cosmetics company, and she becomes a nationally known figure. Anne's face now appears on TV commercials, billboards, newspaper and magazine advertisements.Meanwhile, Jennifer begins an affair with Tony Polar (Tony Scotti), a lounge singer whose career is also mounting. Tony's sister, Miriam (Lee Grant), manages every aspect of Tony's life, and reacts to the relationship with icy disapproval. A little later, Jennifer and Tony get married secretly, and Miriam is despondent.Elsewhere, Neely's fame eventually proves to be too much for her. Her Broadway stardom leads to a career in the movies as she relocates to Hollywood, but her addiction to pills (which she refers to as 'dolls') sabotages her life. She loses Mel when he becomes weary of her vicious and unpredictable behavior, as well as her rumored affair with a Hollywood designer named Ted Casablanca (Alexander Davion). When Mel leaves Neely after filing for divorce, she becomes associated with Ted and ultimately marries him.Jennifer's married life with Tony seems happy enough, although Miriam lives with them and obviously imposes on their marriage. After moving to Los Angeles, Jennifer and Tony settle in a house while Jennifer's modeling career flourishes, Tony's career has peaked, having made the crossover into motion pictures without the same drug-induced success as Neely. One evening, Tony begins to lose control of his motor functions, and Miriam finally reveals to Jennifer why she never wanted Tony to marry: Tony suffers from a rare motor-reutron disease called Hunington's Disease, (similar to A.L.S.) that will ultimately render him senseless and eventually kill him. The disease is genetic and was passed down to Tony from his father who died from the disease several years ago. Jennifer is mortified, because she has just discovered she is pregnant.Some months later, Anne and Lyon rekindle their affair after her modeling success, with Anne leaving behind another beau to reunite with Lyon and relocate to Los Angeles (as well as keep in close touch with both Neely and Jennifer), but she still seethes inside over the knowledge that Lyon isn't interested in marrying her. Neely shows up at her house one night while Lyon is on a business trip, and she tells Anne that Jennifer called her wanting to know where she could get an abortion. Neely also offers Anne some of her pills to help her get through her lonely period with Lyon gone, but Anne bitterly refuses. Neely's conversation with Anne sparks something in her; when she confides in Anne that her marriage with Ted is on the rocks, Anne encourages her to try and renew the spark in their relationship. Neely returns home to her home in the Hollywood Hills only to find Ted frolicking in their backyard swimming pool with another woman. They have a bitter fight and Ted walks out on her.Sinking further into alcohol and pills, Neely is thrown off of the current film project she is working on due to her drunkeness and verbal fights with the crew. When Lyon attempts to get her to a sanitarium to dry out, she sneaks off to San Francisco and spends a few days wandering while drunk and stoned. After she is robbed by a strange man, she is finally picked up and taken to a clinic in L.A. by Lyon and Anne. While there, she goes through some horrible withdrawal symptoms and has some bizarre run-ins with the other residents in the sanitarium. However, she is inspired when she discovers that Jennifer's husband, Tony, is also in the same hospital, now almost completely debilitated. Neely and Tony sing a song together in the hospital recreation room before he lapses back into senselessness. This incident prompts Neely to struggle back to sobriety.Jennifer, meanwhile, is struggling with her own demons. She also begins taking pills and booze to help her cope with Tony's absence as well as an escape for her loneliness. Consistently told by her selfish and manipulative mother that she has no real talent and is only known for her beautiful body, Jennifer turns to making ""art"" films with a French director to make money. She feels her integrity is compromised by doing this, as she is still loyal to Tony and did most of her sexually provocative work before she was married to him. The high cost of Tony's hospital and sanitarium bills forces Jennifer to do the work, and the situation is made worse when she finds herself locked into an oppressive contract with the director which makes Jennifer slide into taking more pills and booze to suppress her emotions. She continues making softcore and hardcore ""art films"" while completely numb of feelings.Emerging from the sanitarium with what seems to be a fresh outlook, Neely makes a cryptic statement to Anne about ""stealing her man"". When Lyon takes Neely to New York to prepare for her comeback to the stage, the two of them share a hotel room, and it becomes clear to Anne that they are involved on a physical level. This is made more hurtful when Anne sees her name in the gossip column, the columnist commenting about how she is a ""big loser"" due to Neely and Lyon flaunting their affair all over New York. Anne finally succumbs to the lure of the ""dolls"", at first taking Neely's old pills and then getting a prescription of her own.In New York City, Lyon gives Neely strict orders to stay out of sight until the debut of her new Broadway show, but when he goes to a party in honor of Helen Lawson's new show, Neely makes an uninvited appearance. The photographers and reporters present give her a huge welcome, much to Helen's chagrin, and she slips off to the ladies room to avoid the ruckus. Neely, however, goes after her, and the two of them have a cat-fight in the ladies lounge. When the fight turns really ugly, Neely winds up tearing off Helen's wig, revealing her unflattering grey hair color underneath. Throwing Helen's wig in the toilet, Neely renders her unwilling to step back out into the party. Helen momentarily considers slipping out the back, until she resolves to face the party again with her hair wrapped in a colorful scarf.Back in Los Angeles, Jennifer's story comes to a sudden and sad close when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She learns that she must have a mastectomy and checks herself into a hospital to have it done. But this is the final blow for her, as she feels that now she won't be able to support herself without her lovely body to rely on. After coming home from the hospital and following a friendly visit by Annie, Jennifer commits suicide by taking an overdose on pills. Her body is discovered the next day.Alone one day and devastated over Jennifer's death as well as the loss of Lyon to Neely, the drunk and stoned Anne wonders down the beach beside her house and after passing out in the surf, she returns to her house and smashes several furniture to pieces. She then decides to leave it all behind and a few days later, she returns to her snowy New England hometown where she is welcomed back by her aunt.In New York, Neely blows her big chance for her Broadway comeback when she gets into an argument with Lyon beforehand. She disregards him by saying ""Who needs you? You're just an agent!"" Lyon abandons her, no longer able to tolerate her egoistical behavior, and in response, Neely turns to a secret stash of pills. When it comes time for her stage entrance, Neely is completely disoriented and unable to perform, giving her understudy the chance to perform on opening night. Neely spends the night getting drunk in a nearby tavern, ultimately finding herself alone and disoriented in a deserted downtown alley.The next morning, Helen Lawson has a candid conversation with Lyon. She predicts that Neely will come back yet again from her latest blunder, simply because she has true talent, but that ultimately she'll destroy herself. She also warns Lyon that he should stop being so careless with his love life and settle down with Anne, before it's too late.Lyon seems to take this advice to heart and he travels upstate to Anne's snowy hometown where he proposes marriage to Anne, but it is indeed too late for them. Anne admits that she has waited so long for Lyon to propose that she now feels nothing when the offer's been made. Having emerged from her brief drug episode with a fresh outlook, Anne seems to be the only one among the three ladies who has learned from her experience. After pouring all her liquor bottles and pills down a sink, she walks off alone into the snowy landscape of her home town and ponders her next move alone and without the need for drugs or alcohol."
You Only Live Twice,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"James Bond and the Japanese Secret Service must find and stop the true culprit of a series of space hijackings, before war is provoked between Russia and the United States. During the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union lose one spacecraft each after they are both seemingly swallowed whole by a second unidentified spacecraft. The two superpowers are quick to blame one another for the disappearances, causing tensions to skyrocket. The United Kingdom has an alternate theory regarding the disappearances however, a theory involving Japan, and sends their number one spy, James Bond, to investigate there. With the help of the Japanese Secret Service, he uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have ever imagined.—goddangwatir As the fragile relationship between the United States of America and the Soviet Union teeters on the brink of collapse, with a series of mysterious spaceship hijackings adding fuel to the fire, Her Majesty's Secret Service swings into action. As a result, the intrepid Agent 007 finds himself in Tokyo to investigate potential Japanese involvement and shed light on the puzzling space disasters. However, the tentacles of the nefarious SPECTRE organisation have spread across the Land of the Rising Sun. Is the world prepared for a violent confrontation between the superpowers? Will British MI6 spy James Bond survive a brush with danger and his old nemesis, SPECTRE Number One Ernst Stavro Blofeld?—Nick Riganas When an American space capsule is swallowed up by what they believe to be a Russian spaceship, World War III nearly breaks out. The British Government, however, suspect that other powers are at work as the space craft went down near Japan. S.P.E.C.T.R.E. is the force behind the theft, as James Bond discovers, but its motives are far from clear, and he must first find out where the captured space capsule is held before America and Russia initiate another world war.—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> During a routine U.S. space mission, a manned American rocket mysteriously disappears while in orbit. The Americans naturally suspect the Soviets and threaten retaliation. However, the British are more cautious after one of their tracking stations indicates that the space craft may have come down near the Sea of Japan. James Bond is sent to investigate, but when the Soviets lose one of their space craft in similar circumstances, 007 has only a few days to locate the launch site and prevent the outbreak of World War III.—Dave Jenkins <david.jenkins@smallworld.co.uk> Orbiting over the Earth is Jupiter 16, a US space capsule manned by two astronauts. As they maintain radio contact with bases in Hawaii and Houston, one of the astronauts ventures outside to make routine repairs, when radar picks up another spacecraft closing fast. Radio contact is lost and the spacecraft opens up and swallows Jupiter 16, in the process severing the other astronaut's lifeline and leaving him to die in space.In Hong Kong, James Bond is enjoying a romantic encounter with a Chinese woman. She leaves the bed and pushes a button that levers it into the wall. Two men burst into the room with machine guns and spray the bed. When the police arrive, the woman has disappeared and James is found dead.A contentious meeting between US and Russian diplomats follows, brokered by a member of Britain's foreign service. The US believes the unidentified spacecraft is Russian in origin, having tracked the ship in orbit before it ventured into the atmosphere; the US is to launch another capsule in three weeks and will regard interference with the ship as an act of war, and will launch a military attack on Russia should the capsule come under attack itself. Great Britain, however, believes the unidentified ship landed in the Sea of Japan based on information from a tracking station in Singapore, and state that there is a British official in Hong Kong that is following this lead.MI6's best agent, James Bond, is buried at sea from the HMS Tenby, before divers recover his body from the sea floor and ""revive"" him, revealing that his assassination in Hong Kong was a ruse to trick his enemies into believing he was dead so he can continue his mission undetected. James is sent to Tokyo to investigate. There, at a sumo match, he is approached by a Japanese secret service agent named Aki, who takes him to the home of Dikko Henderson, an MI6 operative living in Japan who has discovered information about the rogue spacecraft. Henderson theorizes that a third power is using Osato Chemicals, a vast multinational corporation, to launch spacecraft from Japan to attack US and Russian spacecraft and trigger war between the two superpowers. However, Henderson is stabbed to death before he can reveal more. James subdues Henderson's killer, then takes his clothing to disguise himself as the assailant and requests the driver of the getaway car drive him to Osato Chemicals, where the driver is subdued. Inside, James battles with a large bodyguard and defeats him before he finds a safe in the office of the company's President, Mr. Osato, containing paperwork and a film negative that he takes before being pursued by security guards.James is rescued by Aki in a Toyota 2000GT, but he is now mistrustful. When Aki stops her car near a subway entrance James chases her, only to fall into a ""trap"" set by ""Tiger"" Tanaka, the head of the Japanese secret service and the most secretive official in Tokyo. After verifying Tanaka's credentials via a code-word, James works with him and they examine the paperwork James stole from Osato's safe. It details the smuggling of LOX - technical shorthand for liquid oxygen for rocket fuel and which is also the name for smoked salmon, and the perfect cover. The film negative is of a supertanker, the Ning Po, and contains a microdot message that it was taken by an American tourist who was subsequently killed (by whoever works for Osato Chemicals) as a security precaution; the picture shows not only the ship but a small boat of fishing women, indicating the area is an outer island on the way to Shanghai. James theorizes that the international criminal consortium SPECTRE has a role in the space hijackings given their history of using private organizations for the actual legwork of a conspiracy in the service of other foreign powers.James spends the night at Tanaka's house, where he is given exotic hospitality in the form of being bathed by ""very sexy"" young ladies and given a relaxing massage by one. James's massage is taken over by the shapely and scantily-dressed Aki, who has fallen in love with him, a love the two consummate in James's bed.The next day James is arranged to meet with Mr. Osato in the guise of businessman Jim Fisher to negotiate a bulk-purchase of important chemicals. Osato surreptitiously X-rays James, finding he is armed, and James is given a drink by Osato's secretary, Helga Brandt, who is more than just an efficient aide-de-camp. Both Osato and Helga are revealed to be SPECTRE agents. Osato orders hit-men to kill James, but he leaves the building. Outside, assassins fire at James before he is rescued by Aki a second time. Osato's hit-men pursue James and Aki until Tanaka dispatches the hit-men's Toyota Crown into the Sea Of Japan via a transport chopper sporting a giant magnet.Tanaka radios James and orders him and Aki to drive to Kobe, where the Ning Po is being loaded for departure. James then urges Tanaka to contact M in London to dispatch ""Little Nellie"" and her father - an auto-gyro gunship built under the supervision of quartermaster Major Geoffrey Boothroyd, also known as Q. After arriving at Kobe, James and Aki find tanks of liquid oxygen but the two are attacked by a gang of dockworkers. James fights them off to allow Aki to escape, and it appears James himself will get away - until he is ambushed and knocked unconscious.He is bound to a chair in Helga's room on the Ning Po, where she questions him about snooping around the dock and holds a plastic surgeon's instrument dangerously close to James to pry information from him. But she is also aroused by James's masculinity and allows herself to be seduced by him; after consummating their arousal she flies James in a private plane, then bails out and locks him in, but James manages to escape, land the crippled plane, and escape before it explodes.Returning to Tiger's house, James is given photos of the Ning Po showing she stopped at an outer island and offloaded an enormous stockpile of equipment, shown by a vastly lower waterline. James, Tiger and Aki meet Q and Little Nellie, who is assembled by Q's crew of specialists. Sporting a variety of powerful weapons, James flies over the area's islands, and near a volcano he is attacked by four helicopter gunships which he shoots down, leaving no doubt as to the presence of SPECTRE and confirming that the enemy base is close by.A scheduled Russian space shot, meanwhile, goes off, and is grabbed by the enemy rocket, which is tracked by the US Air Force before disappearing, seeming to confirm to the US that the Russians are behind the space hijackings and will now use the excuse of losing their own spacecraft to shoot down the next Jupiter launch. The unidentified spacecraft returns to its extensive base hidden inside the volcano.Both Osato and Helga Brandt meet with their leader in his headquarters after the rogue craft returns to its base. The man's face is not shown however he holds a white cat and finishes a meeting with two scientists who designed the radar jamming system that has cloaked the location of the villain's base. Both men demand more money but acquiesce after his bodyguard, Hans, shows them his leader's pool of piranhas. The two scientists leave and the mysterious villain flashes the x-ray showing James's Walther PPK and expresses his disappointment in both Osato and Brandt for failing to kill him. Both accuse each other of failure. The villain orders Brandt to leave after seemingly giving her one final chance to kill James, but he activates a hidden mechanism and drops her into the piranha pool as she walks across its bridge; she is eaten alive. He then sharply orders Osato to kill James immediately.James is ordered to meet Tiger and Aki at Tiger's palatial estate in Kyoto, which also doubles as a ninja training camp. Tiger also shows James his modern weapons lab and his arsenal of high-tech rocket guns. One item in particular is a tiny rocket hidden in a cigarette. Tiger's plan is to use his army of men to infiltrate a fishing village on the island where the Ning Po last made port. James himself will be disguised as a Japanese man and will train with the rest of Tiger's ninja army; the army will later hide in the island's largest village as local fishermen. James will also take a wife; to his dismay, Aki will not be the woman because she is not from the village. After the procedure which disguises him, James and Aki spend the night together. While they sleep, an assassin sneaks into the rafters above their bed and lowers a needle on the end of a thread. He trickles a powerful poison down the thread towards James, his target, however James and Aki shift in their sleep at the same moment and the poison drips onto Aki's mouth instead. As she struggles and dies, James wakes up and shoots the assassin dead. Tiger comes in and James tells him what happened. James seems more urgent than ever to investigate the plot but Tiger tells him he needs a few more days of training.The next day during a staff match, James is attacked again by another assassin who tries to stab him with a knife hidden in his weapon. James kills the man and Tiger says that the would-be assassin is not one of his own men. The next day, James is wed to a lovely young woman from the fishing village, a student of Tiger's named Kissy Suzuki. They settle into a small house in the village and Kissy rejects James's advances to consummate their marriage. The two also notice a small funeral being held for a young Ama girl who'd been exploring a nearby cave along the shoreline. When the girl's boat floated out of the cave, she was mysteriously dead. At early morning, Tiger warns James that the Americans are launching their next spacecraft that day with a last warning to the Soviets. Bond becomes interested in the cave; the next morning, he and Kissy drift away from the fishing fleet and explore the cave. When they enter it, Bond immediately notices that a poison gas has been released in the cave and they jump over the side of their boat and swim inside. They come ashore and hike up to the volcano's caldera. They see a helicopter fly down into the basin but it disappears. They investigate closer, and by trying to throw a stone into the crater's lake, James reveals that its surface is actually a gigantic metal cover that hides a secret base where the rogue rocket has been hiding after swallowing the USA and Russian spacecraft. James sends Kissy back to find Tiger and his men, while he himself sneaks into the crater when the hatch opens in preparation for another launch of the SPECTRE spacecraft, code-named ""Bird One"" and carrying Soviet Union livery.Inside the volcano, James locates the missing astronauts and cosmonauts being held prisoner. They subdue a few guards and imprison the astronauts that are next to fly into space and capture the next spacecraft launched by the USA. James takes the place of one of them, in the hopes that can sabotage the next capture, however, as he prepares to enter Bird One, the villain notices him mishandling his equipment and orders him to be stopped at the last moment. James is detained and taken to the volcano's command center as a backup astronaut is called to the launch pad to replace him. There he meets the mysterious villain; Ernst Stavro Blofeld, a bald man with a scarred face and leader of SPECTRE, a vast criminal organization. James's personal effects are confiscated and Blofeld, who kills Osato as the price for his failure to kill James, reveals his plan; the capture of both American and Russian spacecraft will trigger a nuclear war between the two superpowers that would eliminate both of them from the world stage, allowing the Asian power who hired Blofeld, which is not stated but strongly presumed to be the People's Republic of China, to move in and replace them as a new superpower.After Bird One's launch, Tiger's ninja army arrives at the crater, but are detected and fired upon by the sentry guns there. Meanwhile, the SPECTRE spacecraft closes in on the American capsule, leading the US forces to prepare to launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. Seemingly helpless watching his allies' fate, James asks for a cigarette as a last request before his impending death, and produces one of the ones given to him by Tiger. He kills one of Blofeld's men with the miniature rocket inside and opens the main crater hatch, allowing some of Tiger's men to storm the base. James slips away in the subsequent confusion. Blofeld orders the hatch to be closed again, but one of the ninjas who made their way inside sticks a grenade to the crater hatch, blowing it open and allowing the remaining ninjas to infiltrate the base. As a fierce battle erupts, Blofeld orders the shutters of the command center to be closed. James and Tiger's men eventually gain the upper hand in battle.When James sees some people running away from the command center to its right, he deduces that there must be another way into the control room, and asks the ninjas to provide covering fire to allow him to climb a flight of stairs that he discovers lead to Blofeld's private quarters. There, James battles briefly with Hans before the two make their way to the bridge across the piranha pool. After James ducks a punch thrown by Hans, he grabs the henchman and throws him off the bridge into the pool. Bond then returns to the control room and struggles briefly with the self-destruct mechanism for Bird One, but eventually presses the button that destroys the craft. When word reaches the Americans that the enemy spacecraft has blown up, they stand down their weapons. Blofeld escapes and triggers a self-destruct system for the base, a bomb that causes the volcano to erupt. Tiger, James, Kissy and the surviving ninjas swim out to the sea through the cave before the eruption destroys the base.As the Japanese maritime forces pick up Tiger and the ninjas, James and Kissy find a life raft waiting nearby and board it. James asks Kissy if it's OK to take their ""honeymoon"" now and she agrees. As they kiss, a British submarine surfaces underneath them and the raft is caught on its forward section. Inside the sub, M orders Moneypenny to tell James to report."
"To Sir, with Love",1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062376/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Idealistic engineer-trainee and his experiences in teaching a group of rambunctious white high school students from the slums of London's East End. Engineer Mark Thackeray arrives to teach a totally undisciplined class at an East End school. Still hoping for a good engineering job, he's hopeful that he won't be there long. He starts implementing his own brand of classroom discipline: forcing the pupils to treat each other with respect. Inevitably he begins getting involved in the students' personal lives, and must avoid the advances of an amorous student while winning over the class tough. What will he decide when the engineering job comes through?—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> A novice teacher (the late Sidney Poitier) faces a class of rowdy, undisciplined working-class students in this classic film that reflected some of the problems and fears of teenagers in the 1960s. Poitier gives one of his finest performances as Mark Thackeray, an out-of-work engineer who turns to teaching in London's tough East End. After searching unsuccessfully for work as an engineer, Mark Thackeray accepts a teaching position at a rough, East End London high school. His colleagues warn him about the impossible brutes he will encounter there, but still he enters his classroom unprepared for their horrible defiance. A classic portrayal of teen angst, where these impoverished, battered kids, who have turned out badly, are determined to brutalize everyone around them. The teachers let them dance between classes to vent some of their aggressive energy, but they all treat the classroom as though it were an unsupervised sandbox. With transcendent dignity, Thackary tames them and teaches them self-respect. As sentimental as the plot may be, the kids' transition is touching, and Poitier is as cool and classy as ever.—alfiehitchie An engineer by trade, Mark Thackeray, a black man, gets a teaching post until he can find an engineering job. His posting is to teach the senior class at North Quay Secondary School in East London, a school in a tough neighborhood where even the most troubled of students are sent. The school is in a primarily white neighborhood where there is a strict moral code amongst the residents of race relations between whites and blacks. Encouraged by his female colleagues but given a sense of resignation by his male colleagues, Thackeray is having trouble with his class, who are openly disruptive. He is having issues with two students in particular, Denham and Miss Dare, issues which he will have to resolve carefully. After an incident which he considers the last straw, he comes to the realization of what his class really does need to learn.—Huggo Negro engineer Mark Thackeray (Sidney Poitier) arrives at the North Quay Secondary School in London's tough East End where he's recently been employed in a teaching position after having been turned down for engineering positions throughout England, and is taking this job to make ends meet while continuing to look for a job in his field.The North Quay staff offer varying opinions about students at the school. The cynical Mr. Weston (Geoffrey Bayldon) is openly contemptuous of them. New hire Gillian Blanchard (Suzy Kendall) is admittedly afraid of them. Deputy Head Evans (Faith Brook) and Clinty Clintridge (Patricia Routledge) warn that while they're mostly good kids, they come from rough homes and excel at riding roughshod over teachers. Headmaster Florian (Edward Burnham) explains that they've been principally rejected from other schools. The audience is informed that their antics drove their last teacher to resign.The students more than live up to their reputation. Led by Bert Denham (Christian Roberts) and Pamela Dare (Judy Geeson), they're an unruly mob who view the classroom as their domain. A battle of wills ensues. As the students' antics progress from mere disruptive behavior to distasteful pranks, Thackeray retains his calm manner and resists being baited. A turning point comes, however, when one morning he discovers something (presumably a sanitary pad) burning in the classroom grate. He angrily orders the boys out of the classroom and excoriates the girls for their disgusting, ""sluttish"" behavior. Dismayed by his lack of self-restraint, he retreats to the staff room, upset that he let himself be manipulated by ""kids.""Returning to the classroom, Thackeray outlines a new approach to teaching his students and sets strict ground rules. The students will be leaving school and entering the adult world soon. His new strategy is to treat them as adults and allow them to discuss issues of their own choosing. He emphasizes this by throwing out all their textbooks. As part of being adults, he insists the students will use proper forms of address (both toward him and amongst themselves) and take pride in their appearance and deportment.While Denham continues to bait Thackeray, the rest of the class is won over. Although Thackeray's humble background is quite like their own, he's made a success of himself by cultivating his language and dress. He insists they can do the same if they wish.Unexposed to the rich history and culture of their own city, the students are especially excited when he suggests they go on a class outing to the British History Museum. The Headmaster is reluctant but issues approval, and Thackeray arrives on the morning of the trip to find a classroom of well-dressed, well-scrubbed students. The outing is depicted in a photo montage of the students enjoying themselves among the sculptures and art.There is a darker turn when the gym teacher, Mr. Bell (Dervis Ward), insists that Carl 'Fats' Buckley (Roger Shepherd) participate in vaulting, despite his classmates' objections. The vault collapses and breaks under Buckley's weight. Although Buckley is not seriously hurt, the boys are angry at the coach for forcing him to attempt the jump. Picking up the vault's broken leg, Potter (Chris Chittell) threatens Bell with it. Thackeray is called to defuse the situation.In class, Thackeray demands that Potter apologize to Bell for the incident even if he believes Bell was wrong. At this point Thackeray has lost the support of much of the class, especially the boys. They refuse to invite him to the class dance, and when Seales' (Anthony Villaroel) mother dies, the class takes up a collection for a wreath but refuses to accept Thackeray's donation. At this point, the Headmaster advises Thackeray that as 'the adult approach' has failed, future class outings are cancelled, and Thackeray will take over the boys' gym classes.Pamela's mother comes to speak with Thackeray, concerned that Pamela is staying out late and might be getting into trouble. Thackeray agrees to speak with Pamela, who insists her mother does not care about her and that the presence of male callers at her mother's house excuses her behavior. Thackeray maintains that Pamela still owes her mother respect, and disillusioned, she angrily accuses him of being 'just one of them'. She also refuses to take the flowers to Seales' mother's funeral. Thackeray's split with the class is complete.Thackeray's search for an engineering position has continued throughout the movie, and at this low point in his relationship with his students, he is ecstatic to receive a job offer.In gym, Denham insists they have a boxing lesson, beginning with him and Thackeray. Thackeray reluctantly agrees. Despite getting in some early blows, Denham is disabled when Thackeray throws a massive abdominal punch that knocks the wind out of him. Thackeray draws back his fist to hit Denham again but gains control of his emotions and declares the fight over.Afterward, Denham waits to speak with Thackeray in the stairwell. Although Denham admits he was trying deliberately to hurt Thackeray in order to convince him to resign from teaching, Denham is surprised that Thackeray did not capitalize on his advantage. For his part, Thackeray admits that he lost his temper but that he understands the apparent unfairness of some of his decisions. Thackeray then offers to recommend Denham for a position as a boxing instructor to the younger students next term.Surprised that he would be regarded as a potential teacher, Denham nevertheless promises to consider it. Denham is clearly impressed, and expresses his admiration for Thackeray to his fellow students. By winning Denham over, Thackeray wins back the respect of the rest of the class, and he is invited to the class dance. When he shows up at the Seales funeral, he is greeted by the entire class, who has come to pay their respects.At the dance, all has clearly worked out well. Weston admits that Thackeray is really quite a gifted teacher and should reconsider leaving. The Deputy Head concurs, suggesting that he should go to another school, if nothing else. Barbara Pegg (Lulu) announces a ""ladies' choice"" dance and Pamela singles out Thackeray as her partner. After the ""ladies' choice"" dance, Denham announces that the class has 'something special' for Thackeray. While Barbara Pegg sings the movie's theme song, Miss Wong presents him with beautifully wrapped gift. Thackeray is too moved for words and retires to his classroom.Alone in his classroom we see that Thackeray's student have gifted him a pewter mug. He lets the accompanying card fall to his desk as he sinks deep in thought. Breaking Thackeray's solitude in the dark silence of his classroom, a young boy and girl burst in, not aware of the teacher's presence. Upon seeing him they begin mocking his gift and joking that they will be in his class next year. When they leave, Thackeray rises, ponders his situation, then retrieves the job offer from his inside pocket and in a moment of clarity, rips it to pieces.Credits roll as the theme song is reprised as we see Thackeray leave the classroom."

Camelot,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061439/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of the marriage of England's King Arthur to Guinevere. The plot of illegitimate Mordred to gain the throne and Guinevere's growing attachment to Sir Lancelot, threaten to topple Arthur and destroy his ""round table"" of knights. The story of the marriage of England's King Arthur to Guinevere is played out amid the pagentry of Camelot. The plot of illegitimate Modred to gain the throne and Guinevere's growing attachment to Sir Lancelot, whom she at first abhors, threaten to topple Arthur and destroy his ""round table"" of knights who would use their might for right.—Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com> After the arranged marriage of Arthur and Guinevere, the king gathers the noble knights of the realm to his Round Table. The dashing and stalwart Lancelot joins, but soon finds himself enraptured by the lovely Guinevere. When Arthur's illegitimate son, Mordred, reappears in the kingdom and outs the secret lovers, Arthur finds himself trapped by his own rules into taking action against his wife and closest friend.—Jwelch5742 Merlin taught King Arthur well. He establishes the perfect kingdom of Camelot, the best knights in the world at the Round Table, and even finds himself a kind, loving wife in Queen Guenevere. Then, along comes the French knight, Lancelot. At first hated by all, he eventually proves himself and becomes the King's best friend and the best knight of the Round Table. He also becomes the Queen's lover, no matter how guilty both feel. Alas, Camelot cannot last! For Mordred, the king's treacherous illegitimate son, catches on, and works to undo everything Arthur worked for.—Tommy Peter During the opening credits, like the Broadway production, the studio orchestra plays a potpourri overture that features the ""Camelot March"" and the title song. The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from ""Guenevere."" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur ""Wart."" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings ""I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?"" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (""Camelot March"") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings ""The Simple Joys of Maidenhood."" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and ""kith not kill their kin"" for her. The procession halts for a rest so the royal hairdresser can prepare Guenevere to meet her mate. While everyone is busy, Guenevere sneaks away into the woods. She kneels in the snow and prays (sings) to St. Genevieve, her patron saint. Arthur, who is listening from a nearby tree, steps on a rotten branch and falls to the ground. Startled, Guenevere starts to run away, but Arthur promises he won't harm her and asks her not to leave. When Guenevere expresses her reluctance to go through with this arranged marriage, Arthur claims Camelot is unique and in the song, ""Camelot,"" describes the joys of life in his kingdom, including an extremely equitable climate. He claims it is an excellent place to live happily forever. When some of Arthur's attendants and Guenevere's entourage find them, Guenevere is shocked to discover that Wart is the King. Once all the attendants withdraw, Arthur tells Guenevere the story of how, at the age of eighteen, he pulled the sword from the stone and became king. He admits he never wanted to be king, but when he saw her for the first time, he wanted to be the wisest, most heroic, most splendid king who ever sat on any throne. Arthur offers to find someone to accompany her back home, but she slowly and tenderly sings a short reprise of ""Camelot,"" which was her way of agreeing to marry him. As they enter the city, a chorus sings a reprise of the song, which continues through their wedding ceremony.Four years later, Arthur laments to Jenny that England is made up of a mess of ill-begotten kingdoms ruled by immoral lords. He tells her that might shouldn't always mean right. After a considerable amount of thinking to himself and talking to Jenny, Arthur formulates the idea of creating a new order of chivalry where might is only used for right. Jenny is skeptical that knights would ever agree to do peaceful things, so Arthur decides to make it a great honor to be in the order. To avoid jealousies and superiority, Arthur further decides to use a round table so there is no head. Then in a reprise of the melody of ""Camelot,"" Arthur and Guenevere sing about spreading the word of this new order of knighthood. As the song continues to play in the orchestra, heralds and carrier pigeons are dispatched to carry the news.Soon the first recruits arrive at Camelot. When news of Arthur's new knighthood order reaches France, Lancelot du Lac sings a short reprise of ""Camelot"" from his castle walls as he fervently anticipates going to England to join Arthurs order. That short reprise segues into the song ""C'est Moi!"" Lancelot, who is far from modest, intends to use his considerable invincibility to serve the Round Table. He claims to be so pure, so godly, that if he had been Eve's partner they would still be in Eden. During the song he embarks on his journey to England. When he nears Arthur's castle, he dismounts, kneels and praises Arthur for creating a new order of life.Suddenly, a horseman rides by so closely that Lancelot topples over. He quickly gets up and challenges the horseman to a fight and knocks him off his horse; it is King Arthur. Once Lancelot realizes that he almost killed the King, he begs Arthur's forgiveness, but Arthur congratulates Lancelot for his fighting skills. Arthur wants to knight him immediately, but Lancelot begs to be allowed to prove himself first. A bit embarrassed, Arthur tells Lancelot that since it is the beginning of May the Queen and the Court have ""gone a-Maying."" Lancelot is incredulous that knights are doing such civilized things as attending picnics and gathering flowers.Guenevere and the Knights and Ladies of the Court are thoroughly enjoying the spring weather. In ""The Lusty Month of May,"" Guenevere recommends defiance of gentility in deference to giving in to ones amorous whims. The Knights and Ladies join her song and perform a spirited dance. At the end of the song, the revelers see an elderly man in rusty armor in the woods. He appears to be lost, so they offer assistance. The old man introduces himself as King Pellinore (Lionel Jeffries). He has mislaid his kingdom and can't find his way back. When Pellinore learns he is in Camelot, he remembers having spent a lovely day there years ago with a young lad name Wart. Guenevere informs Pellinore that Wart is now King Arthur of England and her husband. The Queen invites the old fellow to spend the night so he can see Arthur again. Pellinore quickly accepts; he hasn't slept in a bed since he left whatever the name of his kingdom was.Shortly after Pellinore leaves, Arthur arrives and introduces Guenevere to Lancelot. When the King asks Lancelot to explain some of the plans they have been discussing, Lancelot can't believe a woman would find the details of chivalry interesting. Guenevere assures him that she never tires of anything chivalrous. Lancelot proceeds to explain a training program for knights, but quickly points out that he would never expect any of the knights to live by his exalted standards of physical and spiritual perfection. When Lancelot claims to have achieved physical perfection, Guenevere doubts his boasts. She also questions his spiritual quest since he obviously has no humility.When Arthur and Lancelot depart, Guenevere begins to plot to have the three best jousters challenge Lancelot. The Queen sings ""Then You May Take Me to the Fair"" while she visits with Sir Lionel, Sir Sagramore and Sir Dinadan (Gary Marshal, Peter Bromilow, & Anthony Rogers respectively) individually to incite each of them to teach Lancelot a lesson. Pellinore doesn't trust anyone who doesn't drink, doesn't have a lady and talks to nobody but God and the King. He can hardly wait to see if the Frenchman's claims of physical prowess can withstand the three knights in the joust the next day. When Pellinore retires for the evening, Arthur discovers that the Queen has agreed to allow the three Knights to carry her kerchief in the tournament. Exasperated, he begs her to withdraw her permission, but she refuses unless he commands as King.When she exits, Arthur curses Merlyn for not teaching him how a ruler rules a Queen. He paces and sings ""How to Handle A Woman"" as he tries to remember Merlyn's advice pertaining to women. He finally remembers: ""The way to handle a woman is to love her."" The following day the jousting arena has a circus-like atmosphere. Lancelot easily defeats all three knights and appears to kill Sir Lionel with his jousting lance. Jenny rushes to Lionel's side. Lancelot cradles his defeated rival in his arms, weeps, bows his head in prayer and begs over and over again for the lifeless body to live. Suddenly, Lionel gasps for breath. Guenevere walks over to Lancelot and kneels before him with her hand over her heart, weeping over his rescue of her from the guilt of having caused Sir Lionel's death. Lancelot then kneels and kisses her hand. The look on Arthur's face suggests that he instinctively senses his wife's and Lancelot's mutual attraction. As Lancelot rises and walks away, the entire crowd kneels in homage to him for resurrecting Sir Lionel. The next few scenes show Guenevere sleeplessly thinking about Lancelot, Lancelot in torment as he thinks about Guenevere, and Arthur talking to Pellinore about being in love. When Lancelot comes to Jenny's room expecting to find Arthur, he can't hide his feelings for her and she confesses her feelings for him. Arthur interrupts when he arrives to inform Lancelot that he has proved himself worthy of being knighted.After a very regal knighting ceremony, Arthur walks into an adjacent room where he ponders what to do about the problem he senses. He readily admits that if he could choose any woman on earth, it would be Jenny. He also admits that if he could choose any man on earth as his brother, his son, or his friend, it would be Lancelot. He loves both of them, but he feels they must be punished for betraying his trust. At first, Arthur wants vengeance, but when his temper subsides, he realizes that it would not be civilized to destroy what he loves. He also begins to sense their pain and torment. Since they are both completely devoted to him and the Round Table, Arthur resolves that they will face whatever the future holds together. The Intermission comes at this point with Entracte music featuring an orchestral version of ""Camelot.""As the action commences again, Lancelot bests another knight in a sword fight. The defeated knight accuses him of having been the Queen's lover for years. Lance demands the knight defend his accusation, but the knight stands by his statement. Later, Lance and Jenny sneak into a secret garden for a clandestine meeting. Lance assures her that Arthur knows about them and, therefore, will never leave the castle without one of them with him. Lancelot realizes that he should leave at once and never return, but in ""If Ever I Would Leave You,"" he sings that the right moment never comes. Jenny feels a great deal of shame and guilt, but can't help remembering their past (while the orchestra plays more of the song, the film shows several significant scenes of their romance which apparently spans years; when Lancelot sings again, there are appropriate scenes for the seasons of the year that match the lyrics to the song). At the end of the song, they are back in the present and they embrace.Pellinore tells Arthur if he does not face the truth his Round Table is doomed (the King has been banishing every knight who accuses his wife and Lancelot of adultery). Suddenly, they are interrupted by a pompous young fellow named Mordred (David Hemmings). Arthur seems to be shaken when he learns the man's name because he realizes the young man is the son of a woman with whom he had a one-night stand, Queen Morgause of Orkney, making him Arthur's illegitimate son. Arthur invites Mordred to become a Knight of the Round Table, but the unpleasant youngster quickly admits to detesting swords, spears and horses and he is suspicious of virtues.Mordred has come to Camelot after discovering he is Arthur's bastard son in hopes of gaining the throne for himself. Lancelot advises Arthur that Mordred is trying to destroy the Round Table and is raising an army consisting of the banished knights, but the King is already aware of Mordred's deceitfulness. Lancelot wants to kill him, but Arthur forbids it. Arthur continues to hope that somehow he can make his only son worthy of the throne. After Lancelot leaves, Arthur tells Jenny he needs to talk about trivial things. This wish leads into the song ""What Do the Simple Folk Do?"" When Arthur says the simple folk find relief in whistling, he and Jenny try it, but quickly give up in frustration. Then when Arthur describes a young lad who sings when he is sad, they launch into a happy madrigal-style song. That doesn't work either. Next, Arthur says he had heard that the simple folk dance a fiery dance until their minds are blank. So they spin and twirl, but dancing is no more of a cure than whistling or singing. By the end of the dance they are distraught that these peasant remedies haven't work to relieve their strain Arthur can't escape the problems of ruling England and Guenevere can't forget Lancelot or abandon Arthur. In the following scene, Mordred's army arrives to battle the remaining Knights of the Round Table. During the fight, the Round Table itself is broken into pieces. Arthur and Lancelot watch helplessly in disbelief. Arthur leaves while the fight continues and goes into the legendary forest where Merlyn schooled him.The song ""Follow Me"" is sung by an off-screen chorus as the King rediscovers some of the woodland creatures that Merlyn had taught him about many years before. When he pretends to be Wart again, he imagines that Merlyn is there. Arthur and Wart, who is suddenly standing in front of Arthur, ask Merlyn for a remedy for sadness. Merlyn tells him (or them) to learn something. A little later, Merlyn turns Arthur (or Wart) into a fish and a hawk to help him learn (the film audience doesn't actually see a fish or a hawk). Arthur's lesson is interrupted by Mordred's arrival in the forest. Mordred continues his wickedness by slyly accusing the Queen and Lancelot of deception and infidelity. To test Lancelot's and Guenevere's loyalty, Mordred convinces Arthur to remain in the forest all night. Mordred returns to the court to tell them that Arthur will be hunting all night and will return by mid-morning the next day. Shortly after Mordred delivers his message, Lancelot visits Guenevere in her chambers and begs her to go away with him. Even though she loves Lancelot, the Queen still loves Arthur and is determined to stay with him as long as he wants her. Under those circumstances, Lancelot promises never to ask her to leave again and promises to never come to her again. Jenny similarly swears and she and Lancelot sing ""I Loved You Once in Silence."" As the song concludes, they kiss and walk together wrapped in each other's arms.Mordred and several knights confront them and accuse them of treason. Lancelot manages to escape, but Guenevere is captured. As Lancelot rides away, he encounters Arthur, who is attempting to return to the castle before something happens. Arthur immediately senses the truth and Lancelot covers his face in shame. When Arthur returns to the castle, he stands by helplessly as Guenevere is lead away to prison. An unseen chorus sings ""Guenevere,"" which narrates what happens in her trial and sentencing to be burned at the stake. As preparations for her sentence are being carried out, the chorus questions if Lancelot will be able to save her. Early in the morning Guenevere is marched to the stake. Everyone except Mordred hopes for her rescue. Mordred, on the other hand, mocks Arthur by saying, ""Let her die, your life is over. Let her live, your life's a fraud. Kill the Queen or kill the law.""Just as the fire is touched to the wood, Lancelot and the knights of the Joyous Gard arrive. Arthur is tremendously relieved! Mordred is pleased to see Lancelot and his troops slaughtering Arthur's knights. Lancelot rescues Guenevere and heads for the channel to take her to France. Lance sends a note asking Arthur to meet him in the forest at sunup (this section returns to the film's opening when Arthur is in pre-dawn darkness). Lancelot and Guenevere offer to return to England to face their punishment, but Arthur will not allow Guenevere to be burned at the stake or Lancelot to be beheaded. Instead, he urges Lance to take Jenny to Joyous Gard where she will be safe. Lancelot informs him that she has joined a convent. Arthur bids them goodbye, and seems to have forgiven them.As Arthur returns to his camp to prepare for battle, he encounters a young boy named Tom - the future Sir Thomas Malory, who really existed and who wrote ""L'Morte d'Arthur"", the definitive text on the King Arthur legend in 1471. The boy has only heard stories of the Knights of the Round Table, but those tales have inspired him to want to become a knight. Arthur is encouraged that the ideals of Camelot and the Round Table live on in this young lad. So he orders the lad to return to England to perpetuate the ideals of chivalry and tell future generations that once there was ""a fleeting wisp of glory called Camelot"" (Arthur sings his orders in a reprise of ""Camelot""). When Pellinore arrives with Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Arthur knights Tom and orders him to return home and carry out his orders. Arthur feels victorious. What he accomplished with the Knights of the Round Table and his civilized government will be remembered. As the closing credits scroll across the screen, a chorus sings a climactic reprise of ""Camelot."" The Exit Music consists of an instrumental version of ""Camelot."""

The Fox,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062990/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based onD.H. Lawrence's novella about two young women - sickly, chattering Jill Banford and quiet, strong Ellen March - who are trying, hopelessly, to run a chicken farm in Canada. A gentle but powerful man named Paul Grenfell who used to live on their farm returns and puts things in order. But his proposal of marriage to Ellen awakens the homosexuality dormant in the girls: Jill uses her weakness to make Ellen feel protective, and the women become active lovers.—alfiehitchie A fox in a hen house and a dying oak tree are used as analogies to tell the story of the intersecting lives of three people in rural Ontario. Following college where they met, Jill Banford was able to convince her friend Ellen March to live together as chicken farmers in relative isolation from the rest of the world. It is the middle of their first winter on the farm, their livelihood with which they are struggling financially, it not helped by being plagued by a fox routinely raiding their hen house, Ellen who has been unable to kill it. While Jill is chatty but dependent on Ellen to make this venture work, Jill handling the books and domestic chores, Ellen is the strong but relatively silent one handling most of the heavy farm work. Into their lives enters Paul Grenfell, the grandson of the farm's previous owner. Being a merchant marine, Paul was unaware not only that the farm was sold to Jill and Ellen, but that his grandfather passed away. Two weeks until he needs to return to his ship with he having planned to spend the time with his grandfather, Paul and Jill/Ellen come to an agreement for Paul to stay on the farm in return for doing some of the heavier farm work. Outwardly, Paul's interaction with the two women is much like the two women interact with each other: Paul is chattier with Jill, but he and Ellen seem to have a non-verbal means of communicating. Without any romantic encounters up to this point, Paul announces to Ellen that he fell in love with her on first sight and knew that he would marry her, she who agrees to the proposal. This news to Jill forces the two women not only to examine their situation, but also their relationship and the reason that they both, unspoken, entered into this outwardly hard life.—Huggo Jill Banford and Ellen March are a couple of soon to be spinsters whom are struggling to support themselves by raising chickens on an isolated farm in rural Ontario, Canada. Dependent Jill tends to household chores and finances while the self-sufficient Ellen deals with heavier work, such as chopping wood, repairing fences, and stalking the fox that keeps raiding their coops, although she is hesitant about killing it. Jill seems content with their secluded existence, but the frustrated Ellen is less enchanted by the solitude.In the dead of winter, merchant seaman Paul Grenfel arrives in search of his grandfather, the now-deceased former owner of the farm. With nowhere else to go while on leave, he persuades the women to allow him to stay with them in exchange for helping with the work. Tension among the three slowly escalates when his attentions to Ellen arouse Jill's resentment and jealousy.Eventually Paul tracks and kills the fox. Just before his departure, he makes love to Ellen and asks her to leave with him, but she confesses she would feel guilty about abandoning Jill.

Wait Until Dark,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062467/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A recently blinded woman is terrorized by a trio of thugs while they search for a heroin-stuffed doll they believe is in her apartment. Susy was recently blinded and recently married. Susy's husband, Sam, is asked to hold a doll for a woman he doesn't know as they get off an airplane. The woman disappears. Later, she's found dead by her former associates, Mike and Carlino, small-time hoods, in Susy's basement apartment. (Both occupants of the apartment are then absent.) The doll woman's newer partner in crime, Harry Rote, who murdered her for self-dealing, presses Mike and Carlino into a scheme to recover the doll, which contains a fortune in smuggled heroin. After disposing of the body, the thugs return while Susy is present to continue their search. They assume Susy's blindness will enable them to search her apartment under her very nose for the doll. In Sam's absence, Mike pretends to be an old friend of Sam's, while the three together spin for Susy a story of a murder investigation of her husband from which only the finding of the missing doll can save him. Rote is a predator, and his stalking of Susy becomes ever more obvious as the blind woman's predicament becomes ever more desperate.—Morganalee While trying to smuggle a cache of heroin hidden in a doll into the United States through JFK from a flight originating in Montreal, Lisa spots an adversary at JFK, so she hands off the doll to an unsuspecting man she just met, a New York photographer named Sam Hendrix, from who she plans on retrieving the doll later. However, Sam misplaces the doll once he gets home. That adversary, a sadistic criminal named Harry Roat, using an argument they can't refuse, convinces two of Lisa's just released from prison associates, Mike Talman and Carlino, to assist him in retrieving the doll from Sam's Greenwich Village apartment, them without even knowing what's inside, or without any of the three knowing that Hendrix has no idea where the doll is anymore. Roat, Talman and Carlino believe their task is all the more easy when they learn that Sam's wife, Susy Hendrix, is blind. As Susy is still adjusting to her recent blindness, Sam does whatever he can to make her as self-sufficient as possible, which she often still resents. They concoct a seemingly innocuous plan to infiltrate Susy's life while Sam is conveniently sent out of town on business. If the plan goes awry at any point, Susy would have no idea that her life would be in danger. What Roat, Talman and Carlino may be unaware of is that Susy does have eyes in the form of the Hendrix's precocious adolescent neighbor, Gloria, who knows more about the missing doll than she initially lets on, and that Susy may have certain advantages in life due to her blindness.—Huggo After an airplane trip, a young woman asks Susie's husband, Sam, to keep a doll for her to avoid spoiling the surprise of her daughter's gift. But the real reason is to avoid her partner, Harry Roat, whom she hopes to cheat of the drugs hidden in the doll. Harry discovers her treachery, murders her and leaves the body in Susie's apartment, where he has tracked Sam and the doll. He concocts an elaborate plan, involving Mike and Carlino, small-time hoods, to get Susie, who recently lost her sight in a fire, to reveal the doll's hiding place. They lure Sam away and take advantage of Susie's blindness, posing as an old friend, a police detective, and a father-son pair of eccentrics. Susie eventually catches on and, with the help of her young neighbor, Gloria, shows everyone that she is indeed a ""world-champion blind lady.""—Joe Jurca When Sam Hendrix carries a doll across the Canada-US border, he sets of a chain of events that will lead to a terrifying ordeal for his blind wife, Susy. The doll was stuffed with heroin and when it cannot be located, its owner, a Mr. Roat, stages a piece of theatre in an attempt to recover it. He arranges for Sam to be away from the house for a day and then has two con men, Mike Talman and a Mr. Carlito, alternately encourage or scare Susy into telling them where the doll is hidden. Talman pretends to be an old friend of Sam's while Carlito pretends to be a police officer. Despite their best efforts they make little headway as Susy has no idea where the doll might be, leading Mr. Roat to take a somewhat more violent approach to getting the information from her.—garykmcd The film opens in a Montreal apartment on a cold winter morning, where Lisa (Samantha Jones) waits for an old man to sew bags of heroin into the cloth body of a rag doll. As Lisa leaves the apartment with the doll, we see the man watching her leave, then dialing someone on the phone. Lisa takes the doll with her on a flight to New York City, but when, on disembarking, she sees a man watching her, she becomes worried and gives the doll for safekeeping to fellow passenger photographer Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.). The man who'd been watching Lisa then roughly escorts her away. Later, when Lisa calls Sam to ask for the doll, Sam and his wife are unable to find it.Some time afterward, small-time con artist Mike Talman (Richard Crenna) and his partner Carlino (Jack Weston) arrive at the basement apartment where Sam lives with his blind wife, Susy (Audrey Hepburn). The two men watch until both the apartment's occupants have left, then enter. They have an appointment with Lisa, who'd been their partner in crime prior to the recent imprisonment of both, but they are met instead by Harry Roat, Jr. (Alan Arkin), whom the audience recognizes as the man who watched and met Lisa at the airport. He offers them $2,000 each if they find Lisa's doll, which is somewhere in the apartment.After discovering Lisa's dead body hanging in a garment bag, Talman and Carlino want to make a quick exit, but Roat points out that they have left their fingerprints all over the apartment, while he has worn gloves. Roat is then able to prevail upon the two to help him dispose of Lisa's body (he claims that he killed her because he caught her going into business for herself). Roat orders Talman and Carlino to help him try to find the heroin-stuffed doll.The next day, Susy's neighbor leaves for the weekend, and Sam leaves on a business trip. Once Susy is alone, the criminals begin an elaborate con game: In order to gain entry into the apartment, Talman arrives posing as a friend of Sam's, Carlino poses as a police officer, and Roat poses first as an old man and then as the man's son. Using first an innocuous story about Sam and the doll, then a darker one implying that Lisa has been murdered and that Sam will be suspected, the men persuade Susy to help them find the doll. Talman gives her the number of the phone booth across the street as his own after falsely warning her of a police car stationed outside.Susy meanwhile has grown suspicious of Carlino and Roat, and Gloria (Julie Herrod), a neighbor who is paid by Susy to help her with errands, has been going in and out of the apartment, sometimes without Susy's noticing. After Talman leaves, Gloria sneaks into the apartment carrying the doll, which she stole earlier. She tells Susy there is no police car outside, and Susy discovers the doll. Wanting to confirm her suspicions about Carlino and Roat, Susy tells Gloria to go home and watch the phone booth that is next to Roat's van parked outside. If a man goes into it, Gloria is to phone Susy, let the phone ring twice, and hang up. Gloria tells Susy she can signal her by banging on the pipes.On Carlino's next visit, after he calls Roat at the phone booth, Gloria sends Susy the telephone signal, and she sends the signal a second time after Susy calls Talman to tell him she has the doll. Finally realizing that Talman is a criminal in cahoots with the two others, Susy hides the doll. When he walks in with Corlino and Roat following quietly, she tells him the doll is at Sam's studio. The three criminals leave after Roat cuts the telephone cord.When Susy bangs on the pipes, Gloria comes in and Susy sends her to the bus station in a taxi to wait for Sam. When Susy discovers that the telephone cord has been cut, she prepares to defend herself by putting the criminals in the dark along with her, breaking all the light bulbs in the apartment's light fixtures. She also pours a chemical into a bowl.When Talman returns, she refuses to cooperate when he demands that she hand over the doll. Talman has spent the most time with Susy and he has come to admire her for her quiet strength and ability to stand up to the three criminals despite her disability. He admits to her that he and his confederates are part of a criminal plot and that Sam, as Susy suspected, is completely innocent of any involvement, while Roat is a particular danger. Susy needn't worry, though, Talman says, as he has sent Carlino to kill Roat.However, having anticipated that the others would turn on him, Roat has instead killed Carlino by running him over. As Talman prepares to leave, pausing to say something to Susy as he stands in the doorway, Roat suddenly appears and stabs him in the back.Intent on acquiring the doll, Roat chains the door shut in the dark apartment, pours gasoline on the floor, and sets a piece of newspaper on fire. A desperate battle follows in which Susy throws the chemical solution in Roat's face and forces him to put out the fire as well as smashes the last lightbulb in the apartment. The battle ends when Roat obtains light by opening the refrigerator, whose door he props open with a rag in the hinge. Susy, weeping (because she forgot about the refrigerator light), pulls the doll out of its hiding place and hands it to Roat. While Roat cuts open the doll and gloats over the treasure inside, Susy is able, unnoticed by him, to arm herself with a butcher knife.Roat then announces his intention to rape Susy, but, as he leads her to the bedroom, she manages to stab him in the belly. As she stumbles across the floor toward the kitchen window to scream for help, Roat leaps out from the darkened bedroom and grabs her ankle. Screaming, Susy wrenches free, but the dying Roat doggedly pursues her, using the knife with which she stabbed him to drag himself across the floor. Susy is at the refrigerator, trying to close its door and thus extinguish its light, unaware of the rag that is preventing its closure. She then gropes for the refrigerator's cord, murmuring desperately, ""Where is it?"" As the reeling Roat stands with his last strength and staggers toward her with the knife, the refrigerator light finally goes out, and Susy's scream merges with the sound of a police siren.The scene switches to the arrival of police cars outside the apartment. When the police enter with Sam and Gloria, Sam finds an unbroken light bulb, and we see the room littered with the bodies of Talman and Roat, but no Susy. Finally, as Sam calls out for her, the door of the unplugged refrigerator moves, and Susy emerges from behind it, shaken but alive."
Cool Hand Luke,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061512/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A laid-back Southern man is sentenced to two years in a rural prison, but refuses to conform. Luke Jackson is a cool, gutsy prisoner in a Southern chain gang, who, while refusing to buckle under to authority, keeps escaping and being recaptured. The prisoners admire Luke because, as Dragline explains it, ""You're an original, that's what you are!"" Nevertheless, the camp staff actively works to crush Luke until he finally breaks.—alfiehitchie Lucas Jackson, natural born world shaker, someone with more guts than brains, a man who refuses to conform to the rules he has been given. Sent to a prison camp for a misdemeanor Luke soon gains respect and becomes an idol. He has some fun in jail doing things for the hell of it, after his mother dies the Bosses put him in the box afraid he might want to attend the funeral. When he gets out he runs and gets caught and runs and gets caught, the bosses try to break him but he just won't break.—Sandra Spence Luke Jackson is a cool, aloof man incapable of conforming to the societal demands of his surroundings. After being arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters, Luke is sentenced to two years in a Florida prison farm where he quickly develops a reputation as a man with an unbreakable will and whose spirit simply can't be broken. Idolized by his fellow convicts while simultaneously detested by his superiors, Luke's bravado in the face of adversity makes him both a hero and a villain in the rural prison. But how long will it take before Luke's body gives out?—Kyle Perez When petty criminal Luke Jackson is sentenced to two years in a Florida prison farm, he doesn't play by the rules of either the sadistic warden or the yard's resident heavy, Dragline, who ends up admiring the new guy's unbreakable will. Luke's bravado, even in the face of repeated stints in the prison's dreaded solitary confinement cell, ""the box,"" make him a rebel hero to his fellow convicts and a thorn in the side of the prison officers.—Jwelch5742 It is about May of 1948 in a small northern Florida town. As the film opens, Lucas Jackson (Paul Newman) is using a pipe cutter to cut the tops off of parking meters. He is drinking, possibly drunk, but not violent. When the police arrive, he is peacefully arrested.Luke and three other men arrive at a rural Florida prison where they serve on a road gang performing hard labor. When he arrives at the prison, the warden reads his record. He remarks that Luke had been in the Army, attained the rank of Sargeant, was awarded several medals, but was discharged as a private. Something he did got him busted back down to the same rank at which he entered the Army. Luke is sentenced to two years.Dragline (George Kennedy) is clearly the leader of the prisoners. He is uneducated and illiterate, but smarter, stronger, bigger, and does not hesitate to exercise his power over them. Most of the prisoners willingly submit to Dragline, but Luke does not. There is no open opposition to Dragline, just a casual refusal to change his behavior in order to please others. Nevertheless, Dragline sees this as a threat to his power and dominance.The men leave at sunset and perform over 12 hours daily of grueling hard labor under intense heat and humidity on the side of the road cutting grass with a sickle or shoveling dirt. One of the new prisoners passes out the first day and another one tries to get out of the detail by sweeping, which was a trick played on him. Luke makes it the first day, but exhausted and barely able to get back into the truck.At the end of the first day for the new men, Alibi, the one who tried to get out of the hard labor by sweeping, is made to sleep in the box the first night, a cramped isolation unit outside to learn a lesson to not challenge the guards.After Luke says something that Dragline takes as a challenge to his authority, Dragline arranges for he and Luke to have a boxing match. Being much larger, Dragline simply pounds Luke into a pulp, but Luke will not give up, or stay down on the ground. What begins as a boxing match with enthusiastic prisoners and guards watching slowly turns into a sad spectacle. Prisoners begin to plead with Luke to lay down and refuse to get back up, and eventually Dragline himself pleads with Luke to simply stop fighting back, but Luke will not stop. The prisoners begin to walk away, unable to watch the sad scene any longer. Dragline himself wants the fight to end, and at one point has to catch the beaten and exhausted Luke from falling down, carrying him across his shoulder and gently setting him on the ground, only to have Luke use what little strength he has left to tap Dragline with one last punch. Finally, even Dragline cannot continue. The only men who are still watching are the guards and the warden, but the warden seems concerned about Luke's stubbornness and the guards remain indifferent.Luke becomes the prisoners' hero, and even Dragline is now respectful of Luke during a card game that night of having tricked a fellow opponent on betting with a bad hand dealt, giving him the name ""Cool Hand Luke.""On the chain gang, Luke encourages the other prisoners, by his own attitude and energy, to excel at their menial tasks. This not only encourages camaraderie among the prisoners, it deprives the guards of a stick to hold over the prisoners' heads. The prisoners are forced to shovel sand over a freshly tarred road, and they perform the job so quickly and with such a sense of competition that they complete the job early, and thus by default earn a few hours of relaxation, because there is no more road on which to work.On a Sunday, Luke's mother comes to visit him, visibly ill and dying of cancer or emphysema and still chain-smoking, and it is clear that Luke gets his independent streak from her. He admired her ability to live life on her own terms, and has tried to emulate that, but with much different results.During one very hot and rainy night, Luke decides out of the blue that he can eat 50 eggs. Most of the other prisoners oppose and that it's impossible or will kill him, but Dragline begins to take bets. Luke barely succeeds at it and collects all the money from bets. Soon after, Luke receives a telegram that his mother has died.The warden uses the death of Luke's mother as an excuse to lock him in ""the box,"" solitary confinement in a hot wooden shed. The warden claims that men will often run away when their relatives die, so he locks Luke up until after Luke's mother is buried. This has the opposite effect, and Luke promptly escapes after being released from solitary.Luke is later caught, after mailing a picture and magazine back to his former fellow prisoners. He is double-chained, but escapes a second time. Again, he is recaptured. While Luke is becoming the ""hero"" of his fellow prisoners, it is a role he does not want. He admonishes them to ""stop feeding off me,"" to stop living life vicariously through his acts.The guards and warden determine to break Luke's will. They force him to dig and bury, then re-dig and re-bury, a ditch. He is beaten and tormented, until he finally begs God to spare him from the warden and guards. They take this as a sign that he is finally a broken man, and Luke himself later admits that it did break him.A few days later, the guards have now made Luke a trustee. Nonetheless, when he is later given an opportunity, he seizes it and escapes again, stealing one of the prison trucks to make his get-away. This time, Dragline decides to go with Luke. Only later, after their escape, does Dragline weigh out the consequences. He had only two years left on his sentence, but now - if caught - will probably have many more years in prison.Dragline wants to team up with Luke, but Luke tells him that he wants to go alone. Luke has always been an individual, not a conventional leader, and does not want to take on that role now. Luke goes into a church, after being completely irreverent to God through the entire film, and asks God to help him escape. But the warden and guards arrive, and when Luke mocks them from the church window, he is shot.The local police want to take Luke to the hospital, but the warden insists that they take him back to prison instead. It is clear that Luke will not make it that far, but the warden heads off with Luke in his car. The one guard who always wears sunglasses is attacked by Dragline, and though Dragline is subdued, he managed to take off the guard's mirror-like sunglasses (and the warden runs over them with his car).In the final scene, Dragline is regaling the prisoners with stories of Luke's final moments, and it is clear that Luke is dead. He is the true anti-hero, never wanting to be anybody's role model, just wanting to live life on his own terms. But like the guard's sunglasses, Luke managed to unmask the injustice and hypocrisy of the system in which he was confined. Basically, he gave up his life over a parking meter, but in the final analysis he could not be broken by the system."
Doctor Dolittle,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061584/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the animal communicating veterinarian goes too far for his clientele, he and his friends escape their hometown to the sea in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail. Dr. John Dolittle lives in a small English village where he specializes in caring for and verbally communicating with animals. When Dr. Dolittle is unjustly sent to an insane asylum for freeing a lovesick seal from captivity, his animals and two closest human friends, Matthew Mugg and Tommy Stubbins, liberate him. Afterward, they join Emma Fairfax and set out by boat to find a famed and elusive creature: the Great Pink Sea Snail.—Jwelch5742 Doctor Dolittle (Sir Rex Harrison) is a world-renowned veterinarian who speaks a wide array of animal languages. He sets off from his home in Puddleby-on-the-Marsh, England, in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail. In so doing, he and his friends meet such exotic creatures as the Pushme-Pullyu and the Giant Lunar Moth. This musical is the source of the hit song, ""If I Could Talk To The Animals"".—Randy Goldberg <goldberg@nymc.edu> During the opening credits, which feature animations of various animals, the orchestra plays an overture of three songs from the film, most notably ""Talk to the Animals."" The action begins in the quaint 19th century English seaside village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. Matthew Mugg, an Irish fishmonger, meets his young friend Tom Stubbins, as Matt wheels his fish barrow around the wharf collecting fresh seafood for his customers. Matthew rescues an injured duck from a fisherman who intends to eat it for his dinner. As soon as Matthew finishes his rounds, he tells Tom they will take the duck to John Dolittle, the greatest animal doctor in the world. Matthew explains that Dolittle talks to the animals to determine what ails them. To explain further, Matthew sings ""My Friend the Doctor."" During the song Tom accompanies Matthew as he makes his deliveries to his customers. By the time the song ends, they have arrived at Dolittle's house. When a chimpanzee and a parrot answer the door, Matthew introduces Chee-Chee and Polynesia to Tom. After the introductions, they go into the library where Dr. Dolittle is trying to converse with some goldfish. He explains to Matthew and Tom that he is attempting to gather information about the legendary Great Pink Sea Snail. He soon plans to embark on a voyage to find the creature. Tom takes the duck out of his coat where he has been keeping it safe and hands it to the doctor. After a few quacks back and forth, Dolittle is certain that the drake has had a row with his wife. The doctor invites Tom and Matthew to dinner and instructs Polynesia, the parrot, to prepare for two more guests. Tom and Matthew had encountered a thunderstorm on the way to Dolittle's, so the good doctor furnishes them with dry clothes. When they return from changing out of their wet togs, Chee-Chee is frying sausages and bacon while a pig is squealing his displeasure. The doctor doesn't join them for dinner. He explains that he doesn't eat meat; it upsets the animals and besides one shouldn't eat their friends. In ""The Vegetarian,"" Dr. Dolittle explains further. Instead of meat, he eats such things as apple cores, plain brown bread and drinks parsnip juice. He admits, however, that the sausages look very good and begins to waver in his conviction. At that point, he calls such things as turnip pie and peanuts filth and rubbish and proclaims: ""I'm a cheat! I love meat!"" However, when he hears Gub-Gub, the pig, squeal, he returns to being a reluctant but sincere vegetarian. When Tommy asks how he became a veterinarian, Dolittle explains that his sister, Sarah, started it all. At that point, the film flashes back to an earlier time when Dolittle was a human doctor and his sister was his house keeper. Sarah complains when her brother brings animals into the house and gives them sleeping space all over the inside of their home. Presently, Lady Petherington arrives to see the doctor. Her nerves are frayed because during a dinner party the previous evening a mouse had scampered across her table. While she is explaining this to the doctor, little white mice are crawling on her chair and onto her enormous bonnet. Soon the village's Vicar arrives with a terrible sneeze. He explains to Sarah that the Bishop is coming to visit and the Vicar needs to be in good health when he arrives. Then the village Magistrate, General Bellowes, arrives with a bandaged foot. Suddenly, Lady Petherington screams and runs from the doctor's office. Her screams cause other accidents that cause more problems for the Vicar and Bellowes. By the time they all leave, Sarah presents an ultimatum to her brother: either the animals go or she goes. Dolittle chooses the latter option. Later that evening when Matthew stops by for a friendly visit, Dolittle is despondent. He admits to Matthew that he is not a good doctor because he really doesn't care about his patients. He doesnt have anything in common with the human race. From its perch, Polynesia says, ""Be an animal doctor."" Dolittle immediately likes the suggestion. After all, he says, there's not one good animal doctor in the west of England. When he learns that Polynesia, a 199-year-old parrot, speaks 2,000 animal languages, he asks if he could I learn to talk to animals? The parrot assures the kindly doctor that he could and that she will teach him. Dr. Dolittle is so keen on this idea that he expresses his feelings in ""Talk to the Animals."" Later, Matthew, Tommy and Polynesia join the doctor in the song. During the song, Dolittle goes to bed still thinking about all the animal languages he can learn so he can speak to each animal when he encounters them. In the morning, he is still awake and continuing to sing (in his mind). Once he dresses for the day and goes downstairs, Polynesia helps him say good morning to Gub-Gub, the pig, by combining sounds with foot and leg movements. The doctor is so excited with his success in communicating with the pig that he informs Polynesia that he wants to say good morning to every animal in Puddleby (and the song continues as they greet various animals). After the song, the film returns to 1845. Dr. Dolittle informs Tommy that he has learned 498 animal languages. The doctor is reminded that he'll need more than languages if he intends to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail. He'll also need lots of money. One of Dr. Dolittle's patients is a short sighted horse, which he furnishes with gigantic glasses. However, the horse's owner, General Bellowes, bursts into the doctor's office and accuses the doctor of being a horse thief. A mother fox and her babies get extremely nervous at the sight of Bellowes; he has been hunting foxes lately and has chased the mother. When the mother fox runs away, the horse bolts and runs out of the office too. Bellowes chases them , but is foiled by some skunks. Dolittle explains to Tom and Matthew that he imported the skunks from America to help protect the foxes. He assigns each skunk to a fox to disguise their smell from the foxhounds. Emma Fairfax, Bellowes' niece, had accompanied her uncle to Dolittle's office. She chides the doctor for his irresponsibility and rudeness to her Uncle. She would like to be a man so she could take revenge. For her feistiness, Matthew gives her the nickname ""Fred."" Her horse had been spooked by the skunks, so she is forced to walk home. During her walk across the countryside and through streams, Emma sings ""At the Crossroads."" In the lyrics, she admits that her life is not the one she intended to lead. Later, Dolittle and his friends find a huge package in his yard. When they open it they discover a two-headed llama-type creature from Tibet, the Pushmi-Pullyu. A picture message from Dolittle's friend, Long Arrow, accompanied the package; the message encouraged Dolittle to use the Pushmi-Pullyu to make the money necessary for the voyage to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail. Matthew, Tommy and Dolittle take the creature to a nearby circus owned by Albert Blossom. Once Blossom sees the creature, he is so excited he sings ""I've Never Seen Anything Like It."" He calls all the circus performers out to see this amazing animal. Dr. Dolittle sings about the Pushmi-Pullyu's dance ability and he and the creature demonstrate with a minuet-type dance. Once Blossom agrees to share the profits, he and Dolittle finally agree on a deal. The Pushmi-Pullyu becomes the star attraction of the Dolittle and Blossom Circus and crowds flock to see the creature dance. Emma is seen among those in the audience. Later, Emma comes to the circus to complain about Dolittle exploiting the animals, but Matthew defends his friend. Matthew, who is infatuated with ""Fred,"" attempts to help her understand by singing ""Beautiful Things."" He sings that our lives are full of beautiful things. By the end of the song, Emma seems to have changed her mind about the doctor. When the circus seal can't catch the ball thrown by his handler, Dr. Dolittle befriends the seal named Sophie and discovers that she misses her husband who is at the North Pole. Dolittle decides to take her to the Bristol Channel so she can swim to her husband. That night he sneaks her out of the circus dressed as a baby in a pram (perambulator). Once it is daylight, he dresses the seal in a woman's hat and clock he took from a tavern, so they can catch the coach to Bristol. When the road is blocked by police a few miles from Bristol, Dolittle and the seal transfer to a hay wagon. Once the driver stops, Dolittle talks to the horses into delivering the seal and the doctor to the rocky Bristol Channel shoreline. Just before he helps the seal into the sea, Dolittle sings ""When I Look Into Your Eyes."" Dolittle kisses Sophie goodbye and tosses her into the ocean still in the lady's clothing. When he turns around, two men are standing there; they think he has thrown a woman into the water, so he is hauled off to court.
Unfortunately, the Magistrate for Dolittle's hearing is General Bellowes (Emma is seen in the court room). Of course, everyone thinks Dolittle is daft when he claims the seal asked him to help her get to her husband. The Doctor attempts to prove his ability to talk to animals by staging a conversation with Bellowes' Great Dane, Rufus. When Dolittle translates the dogs report of the gigantic dinner the General consumed the previous evening, Bellowes takes offense and dismisses the court until the following day. When Tommy and Matthew visit the doctor in his cell, Emma brings Tom and Matthew dinner and tells Dolittle that Rufus was correct about her Uncle's meal. The next day, the General announces that Dr. Dolittle has been acquitted, because the lady who owned the stolen clothes refused to prosecute (there seems to be some indication that the lady is Sarah, Dolittle's estranged sister), however, the General and a couple of other judges agree that Dr. Dolittle's talking to animals necessitates his being committed to an asylum. As his last speech before being taken away, Dolittle sings a clever song, ""Like Animals."" The doctor admits to not understanding the human race and accuses people of inhumane treatment of animals. He also abhors human phrases like ""treat him like a dog,"" ""working like a horse"" and ""eating like a hog"" (when we mean ""eating like a man""). He also complains that we call a hoodlum a weasel or a rat and a woman of ill-repute a vixen or a cat. He chides the women in the courtroom for wearing furs by asking them if they ever thought they were wearing someone's brother or mother. After his song, Dr. Dolittle is escorted to the jail awaiting transfer to the asylum. Matthew and Tommy plot to break their friend out, but Emma is skeptical that their plan will work. Matthew tells her that he, Tommy and several of the animals will sail away to search for the Great Pink Sea Snail as soon as they break the doctor out of jail. Emma begs Matthew to allow her to come along on the voyage as their cook. Matthew doesnt exactly approve, but he hints that if she were to stowaway he wouldn't know where to look for her. When she kisses him for the idea, he sings ""After Today."" He is confident that one little kiss will change his life.
On the day the doctor is being transferred to a police wagon to take him to the asylum, Polynesia talks the horses into running away before the policemen board. She also convinces the police horses to buck and rear allowing the wagon to get away. Chee-Chee steals the keys to the police wagon so it can be unlocked to free Dr. Dolittle.
In the next scene, their ship, the Flounder, is at sea. Dolittle quickly discovers that Emma is on board and has prepared a vegetarian meal, seaweed pie, for them. When Dolittle objects to having a woman on the voyage, Emma assures him that she expects to be treated as one of the crew... and, as a matter of fact, she often ends up with the hardest and dirtiest jobs. During dinner, Emma asks where they are going. Dolittle explains that he randomly sticks a pin into any page of the map and they simply end up there. Emma can't believe their destination is determined so haphazardly. She begs the doctor to take them to exotic locations in the song ""Fabulous Places."" Matthew, who is still infatuated with Fred, also joins her in the song. Their protests are in vain. At the end of the song, Emma drops the pin on the map; it lands on the tiny Sea-Star Island, a floating island. During a fierce storm, the Flounder is torn apart. Dolittle, Matthew and Tom are floating on separate parts of the wreckage, but they have no idea if Emma is safe. As if it were planned, the Sea-Star Island comes floating by, so Dolittle talks a porpoise into pulling him on shore, while Matthew and Tommy paddle their parts of the wreckage. Shortly after they reach shore, Tom and Matthew leave to search the island for Emma. While they are gone, she walks out of the woods onto the beach dressed in her under garments (all of her dresses were lost in the storm). Dolittle and Emma both seem to realize they are mutually attracted to each other and express their feelings in the song ""I Think I Like You."" Suddenly, Emma and John are taken captive by a group of savages. They are taken to the village and are tied up in a hut where Matthew and Tom are similarly captive. Dolittle talks some mice into chewing through the ropes that bind him and he unties the others. When he looks outside, Dolittle discovers frost; the island has been blown off course by the storm. When the chief of the tribe comes to the hut, the doctor says, ""Hello. Me Doctor Dolittle. Here little boy, late for school, here very cold. They all go home Puddleby, yes?"" And in perfect English, the chief replies, ""What a funny accent."" The chief's name is William Shakespeare, the Tenth. He explains that they name their children after their favorite authors. Lots of ships have wrecked on the island and they have collected numerous books and treasures and have become quite educated and civilized. However, they do have some strange laws, such as the person who brings winter must die - meaning Dolittle. The doctor quickly learns that the climate change has caused health problems for the other living things on Sea-Star Island, so he, of course, doctors them. The chief, who is known as Willie, is impressed by Dolittle's healing powers, so the death sentence is lifted. Dolittle then gets the idea to ask a blue whale to push the island back on course, but when the island begins to move, a revered balanced stone falls into a volcanic crater. Disturbing the balanced stone also carries a death sentence. Just before that sentence is carried out, the whale pushes the island back into the African mainland where it belongs. Once again, the death sentence is lifted. Dr. Dolittle resumes his task of treating the island's creatures. When several of the island's children gather, Matthew, Tommy and Polynesia sing ""Doctor Dolittle"" to welcome the children to the doctor's wonderful world where crocodiles talk and elephants sing. After the song, they hear an unusual noise. The sound is the Great Pink Sea Snail sneezing. Dr. Dolittle concocts a tonic for the snail and in gratitude it offers to transport them back to England. Since the snail's shell is watertight and has room for several passengers, Dolittle sends Matthew, Tommy, Emma and his animals back, but decides to stay behind on the island since he would be sent to the asylum if he returned. During his goodbye to Emma, Dolittle tells her he plans to explore the moon on the Giant Lunar Moth. Emma wants to remain with Dolittle, but finally kisses him goodbye and tells him she will miss him. Once she gets inside the shell and the snail sails away, she starts to cry. A little while later, Sophie, the seal, and her husband turn up at the Sea-Star Island. She tells Dolittle that the animals of England have gone on strike until he is allowed to return and the authorities are anxious for him to come back. The doctor quickly constructs a saddle and arranges for the Giant Lunar Moth to fly him back home that very evening. As the film ends with Dr. Dolittle astride the huge insect, a chorus sings a reprise of ""My Friend the Doctor."""

After 17 years, things have become too predictable and stale. They argue, they visit a marriage counselor, Richard (drunk) visits a prostitute. They split up. After meeting other people, they are re-united at a night club where they realize that their marriage was better than their divorce. With two teenage children, Richard and Barbara Harmon, both from working class backgrounds, have hit a rough patch in their 17 year marriage. Richard cannot understand why Barbara isn't happy while he feels he has slaved for years, just within the last few years finally to become a business success and good breadwinner. Barbara feels he doesn't communicate well or understand her emotional needs, and that he changed ever since he became that business success which is more important than her in their marriage. Their sexual dry spell is difficult on both, as neither has even contemplated being unfaithful. Taking advice from others, they take measures to protect their individual selves, in the process exacerbating the issue of divorce, which had not even been a possibility before these measures. As they work toward divorce, they have to figure if they truly want a future without the other. Adding to the complicated situation is long divorced couple Nelson and Nancy Downes, the former who is trying to marry off the latter in order not to have to pay alimony anymore and get himself back on his feet. Nancy, in turn, does want to remarry to someone as she is lonely, but will only do so if it makes economic sense. For Nancy, Richard fits the love side of the equation, but not the economic side as long as he has to pay alimony to Barbara. So Nelson and Nancy go on a mission to get Barbara remarried to someone else."

Flint finds that a group of women have banded together to take over the world through subliminal brainwashing in beauty salons they own.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> You have to watch this with tongue firmly in cheek. I feel the Flint movies are the best satire of the James Bond superspy motif. This is the second movie but obviously can enjoy it without having seen first. Patently ridiculous plot about secret organization taking over the world, but who is it and why?? Women have joined together and using beauty spas have been serrupticiously hypnotizing women around the world. I think one of the funniest jokes is one I missed first time I watched it: the names of the three male scientist who joined with women to conquer the world...small joke but type of thing this movie has in it all over the place that a lot of time is I think is missed because so much of rest of movie is ""over the top,"" as you might say."

Bianca is eyed and courted by a number of good-looking and well-to-do young men who follow her to her home. However, Baptista announces that Bianca cannot be courted or marry until her elder sister, and his older daughter, Katharine (Elizabeth Taylor) is wed. As Katharine is out-spoken and far from demure, none of the men in the town want to marry her, so Bianca remains unwed even though many suitors hover to woo her.Lucentio sees the competition and devises a plan in which he disguises himself as a Latin tutor, named Cambio, in order to woo Bianca behind Baptista's back and at the same time has Tranio pretend to be him.Meanwhile, two noblemen named Hortensio (Victor Spinetti) and Gremio (Alan Webb), plot to try to woo Katharine hoping to either marry her or find someone to marry her off too. Their debate changes when Petruchio (Richard Burton), a rough-and-ready land owner, arrives in Pauda, accompanied by his personal servant Grumio (Cyril Cusack), having left Verona (the same city which 'Romeo and Juliet' takes place).

She is refused food and clothing because nothing - according to Petruchio - is good enough for her; he claims that perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress doesn't fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also disagrees with everything that she says, forcing her to agree with everything that he says, no matter how absurd; on their way back to Padua to attend Bianca's wedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims ""if you please to call it a rush-candle. Henceforth, I vow it shall be so for me.""Meanwhile, Hortensio has married a rich widow. In the final scene, there are three newly married couples; Bianca and Lucentio at their wedding party; the nameless widow and Hortensio, and Katherina and Petruchio. Because of the general opinion that Petruchio is married to a shrew, a good-natured quarrel breaks out amongst the three men about whose wife is the most obedient. Petruchio proposes a wager whereby each will send a servant to call for their wives, and whichever comes most obediently will have won the wager for her husband. Katherina is the only one of the three who comes, winning the wager for Petruchio. She then hauls the other two wives, including Bianca, into the room, giving a speech on why wives should always obey their husbands.

Set in the Haiti of ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier, this movie tells the story of a sardonic Welsh hotel owner and his encroaching fatalism as he watches Haiti sink into barbarism and poverty. Complications include his inability to sell the hotel so he can leave, a friendship with a rebel leader, some politically ""charged"" hotel guests, an affair with the German-born wife of a South American ambassador, and the manipulations of a British arms dealer who's in over his head.—Max Chandler <netropic@speakeasy.org> Chapter One: ArrivalA cruise ship arrives in Port-au-Prince, Haiti with four passengers: Major H. O. Jones (Alec Guinness), a British businessman with a letter of invitation to do business with the government; an elderly American couple, Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Paul Ford and Lillian Gish) who have the idea to invest in the nation to set up a vegetarian complex for education and nutrition for the locals; and the central character, a cynical, washed-up individual named Brown, (Richard Burton).Upon arrival Major Jones presents his credentials to Captain Concasseur (Raymond St. Jacques), a law enforcement officer, who notices that the official who invited Jones has been deposed and imprisoned. Concasseur and his men rough up and imprison Jones.Brown has been bequeathed a hotel in the capital from his late mother but has been unable to sell it in his trip to New York. Brown also has an ongoing affair with Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), the wife of the British ambassador Pineda (Peter Ustinov). When Martha and Brown have an argument, Brown goes to Mere Catherine's brothel where he discovers that not only has Jones been released, but he's a guest of Captain Concasseur and is being treated to enjoying the hospitality of Brown's favourite tart, Marie Therese (Cicely Tyson).Jones has gained the favor of the new 'Papa Doc' Duvalier regime who are keen to receive a supply of arms that they have paid a down payment on. Jones claims the weapons are impounded in a warehouse in Miami, but the weapons may be imaginary and a confidence trick by Jones. Once bitten, twice shy, the government will not allow Jones to leave the island until they are sure the weapons exist.Meanwhile, Mr. Smith, a former Vegetarian Party candidate for the Presidency of the United States against Harry S. Truman, is given a tour of a suburb of Port-au-Prince, an empty shantytown called Duvalierville. During the evening he and Mrs. Smith follow a local procession that they believe is a religious ceremony but turns out to be an audience for executions by firing squad. The evening's fun and frivolities continue as Captain Concasseur and his men enter Brown's hotel and beat him up until Mrs. Smith bluffs the thugs into leaving by announcing that she will inform her husband, the American Presidential Candidate. The Smiths depart from Haiti the next day.Chapter Two: Brown's FriendsOver the next few weeks, Brown watches as the Duvalier regime seeks to put down any dissent with an iron fist. He becomes friends with Dr. Magiot (James Earl Jones), a rebel leader.As Brown becomes a reluctant participant in the planned insurrection, the rebels recruit Major Jones to provide military leadership. Jones has been regaling the other expatriates with his tales of heroism as a Commando officer in the World War II Burma Campaign that Brown does not quite believe, comparing him to Errol Flynn in 'Objective, Burma'. Brown hosts a meeting of the group, including Magiot, Jones, and Ambassador Pineda. But trouble ensues soon thereafter--Duvalier spies from the Tonton Macoute are watching Brown's Hotel Trianon and his every step.The day after the meeting, three assassins confront Magiot while he's performing surgery, and cut his throat with a scalpel knife in the operating theatre. Upon learning of the brutal murder, Brown reluctantly agrees to drive Jones, who escapes by dressing as Brown's female cook wearing drag and blackface, into the countryside to the rebel base under the cover of night. When picking him up that evening, he realizes that Jones has apparently become involved with Martha Pineda. Brown leaves town with him in a jealous rage, and the inebriated Jones makes matters worse by bragging about his conquest. Driving carelessly up the treacherous, winding road, Brown hits an embankment and breaks the cars front axle. The two continue their journey on foot, arriving at a remote cemetery, the designated meeting point, too late. They settle in for the night with Jones admitting that his jungle war stories were total fabrication; his wartime career was running a cinema in India.In the morning, the omnipresent Captain Concasseur and a Tonton Macoute accost Brown as he tries to find rebels in the area. They demand to know where Jones is, but Brown denies that the Major is there. As soon as Brown has finished speaking, a sleepy Jones approaches, unaware of the Macoutes presence. The two command him to stop, but Jones turns around and runs uphill into the cemetery. They open fire, killing Jones. Then they order Brown to get into their jeep with them. As he does so, shots from rebels ring out, and the two drop dead.Chapter Three: Helpful OutsiderUpon being asked about Major Jones, Brown tells the two rebels in dismay: ""You arrived two minutes too late."" He then shows them the body of Jones. The taller of the two, after hearing that Magiot has been eliminated as well, comments: ""They have killed the best of us.""The two rebels then plead with Brown to assume the role of Jones, seeing this as the only hope they have left. Brown hesitates, commenting that he is no military man. But he finally relents after being asked whether he wants to continue living like this.After a long walk, the three meet up with a small, ragtag group of poorly equipped rebels. The group buys the deception, believing that Brown is Jones, and he gives a cynical, taunting speech, apparently without being understood, since the rebels speak Creole French and Brown only speaks English.The camera then cuts to the Pinedas, as they are about to leave the island. Petit Pierre (Roscoe Lee Browne), a journalist friend of Brown, sees them off, telling them about a battle between government troops and rebels, and stating that two rebels have been killed and noting that one of the rebels was the bellhop at Brown's hotel and the other rebel was ""unidentified"". The Pinedas plane takes off, and Martha notices smoke on a hillside of the island.The question whether Brown has survived the skirmish remains unanswered, although Petit Pierre's cryptic remarks on the two rebels killed in the recent battle between government forces and rebels seem to indicate that Brown was the unidentified rebel who was killed in the fighting."

Her chief consolation now is the companionship of her effete houseboy, Anacleto, who shares her cultural interests, while disdaining the crudities of her husband. Tonight, they are being observed by Private Williams, hovering in the darkness outside, fascinated by Leonora's attention that afternoon. The next morning, Leonora goes riding, accompanied by both Langdon and her husband. To their amazement, they see Private Williams, stark naked, also riding through the woods. When the Pendertons are asleep that night, in separate bedrooms, Williams returns, squats besides Leonora's bed, staring at her until dawn, then returns to his barracks. When he leaves the house, he is observed by Alison. Alison questions Leonora, next day, when she comes to borrow Anecleto to work at her party that night, but the idea strikes Leonora as being ridiculous. Penderton now decides to prove himself by secretly taking out his wife's horse. Firebird runs away, with Penderfon getting badly scratched by trees in the woods. He beats the horse before dropping with exhaustion. To his horror, Penderfon discovers that he has been observed by Private Williams, sunbathing on a rock. Leonora's party in progress, Penderton returns to the stable, stares, fascinated, at Williams caring for the horse's cuts, before tending to his own wounds. Penderfon returns home with a phony story that causes Leonora to go to the stables to learn the truth. She returns to the party and whips her husband across the face with a riding crop. Alison, meanwhile, is in her sickbed across the way, visited briefly by Captain Weincheck (IRVIN DUGAN), who is being forced into retirement by Penderton, for his lack of ""leadership qualities."" Unable to sleep, Alison again thinks she sees a figure standing near the Penderton house. Anacleto sits with her, after, and talks about his dreams. In the following days, Penderton's fascination with Williams grows more intense. The Major has difficulfy with his lectures, cutting one short to ride out in search of the sunbathing soldier. After a boxing match, Penderton sfalks the boy, picking up his discarded candy wrapper to add to his secret collection of fetishes, including an antique silver spoon stolen from Captain Weincheck. That night, Alison awakes and from her window sees somebody stealthily enter the Penderton house. She puts on a coat, rushes after the dark figure. Bursting into Penderton's study, she tells him her husband has gone up to Leonora's bedroom. She rushes upstairs, sees Williams instead. Not doubting her, but hoping to avoid a direct confrontation, Penderton eases her back to her own house, where they are greeted by her husband and Anacleto. Alison confronts her husband with the news that his mistress is deceiving him with an enlisted man. With the assistance of Anacleto, she begins packing, planning a separation and divorce. Langdon is convinced that Alison, gone mad, hasn't seen anybody in Leonora's bedroom. The doctors concur and the next day Alison is taken to a sanitarium in Virginia by Langdon and Anacleto. Before Langdon can return to the post, Alison dies of a heart attack and Anacleto vanishes. Langdon and Leonora have difficulty renewing their passion, with Alison dead. They go out to the woods, leaving Penderton to exercise with his barbells. Pressure mounts within Penderton. The strain finally shows on Private Williams, as well. He provokes a fight in the barracks latrine. Unable to control his voyeur instincts any longer, he later gets up from bed, makes his way through a thunderstorm to the Penderton house and Leonora's bedroom. This time, standing by an upstairs window, Penderton sees him. He takes his pistol and shoots the young soldier as he squats by Leonora's sleeping body. The shot startles her awake; Langdon rushes across from his house."

The Producers,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063462/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A stage-play producer devises a plan to make money by producing a sure-fire flop. Down-on-his-luck theatrical producer Max Bialystock is forced to romance rich old ladies to finance his efforts. When timid accountant Leo Bloom reviews Max's accounting books, the two hit upon a way to make a fortune by producing a sure-fire flop. The play which is to be their gold mine? ""Springtime for Hitler.""—Scott Renshaw <as.idc@forsythe.stanford.edu> Brash and loud Max Bialystock was once a successful Broadway producer who now resorts to wooing and seducing elderly women, each with their own specific sexual peccadillo, to raise enough money for his shows. Leo Bloom, a nervous man prone to hysterics, is the latest person Max's accounting firm has sent to audit Max's books. The two decide to join forces to produce a Broadway show after an innocent passing comment by Leo: that a producer can make more money with a flop that closes after one performance than a success as the producer would not have to pay back the investors as the investors have bought into a specific percentage of the show. Thus their goal is to raise as much money as possible to produce a guaranteed flop that closes after one performance. Their first task is to find the worst show ever written, which they believe they have in the offensive ""Springtime for Hitler"", a musical love story to the famed dictator written by patriotic and deranged Nazi German, Franz Liebkind. Max then goes into overdrive to raise the money from his regular stable of elderly female investors and those of a similar ilk. He is so successful in this venture, selling 25,000% of the show, that Max decides to get a human plaything as his short term reward. And they are able to hire who is considered the worst director in the business, Roger De Bris, and miscast the lead role with an actor who goes by his initials, L.S.D., which truly does match his nature. But with all these pieces to produce a sure-fired flop, have they actually created the perfect storm?—Huggo Max Bialystock is a washed up Broadway producer. Leo Bloom is a mousy PA (public accountant). When the two meet, their combined expertise points them toward the ultimate scam: Raise more money than you need for a SURE-FIRE Flop Broadway Show. No one will expect anything back and you can pocket the difference. They need the worst play to do this. They find it in the musical ""Springtime for Hitler"".—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The once-great Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) had once been the toast of Broadway, but now he has been reduced to a washed-up, aging, fraudulent, corruptible, and greedy Broadway producer who barely ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women (""angels"" in theatrical terms) in exchange for money for his next play. Accountant Leopold ""Leo"" Bloom (Gene Wilder), a young man who is highly nervous and prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to do his books and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, Leo has a revelation: a producer could make a lot more money with a flop than a hit by overselling shares in the production, because no one will audit the books of a play presumed to have lost money. Max immediately puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max eventually convinces him that his drab existence is no better than prison.After reading many bad plays (including a stage adaptation of Franz Kafka's 'The Metamorphosis'), the partners find the obvious choice for their scheme: Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden. It is ""a love letter to Hitler"" written in total sincerity by deranged ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). Max and Leo persuade Liebkind to sign over the stage rights, telling him they want to show the world ""the Hitler you loved, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler with a song in his heart."" To guarantee that the show is a flop, they hire Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett), a director whose plays ""close on the first day of rehearsal."" The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic, but only semicoherent, flower power hippie named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known as L.S.D. (Dick Shawn), who can barely remember his own name and mistakenly wandered into the theater during the casting call. After Max sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors (dozens of lustful little old ladies), they are sure to be on their way to Rio.The result of all this is a cheerfully upbeat and utterly tasteless musical play purporting to be about the happy home life of a brutal dictator. It opens with a lavish production of the title song, ""Springtime for Hitler,"" which celebrates Nazi Germany crushing Europe (""Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for Poland and France""). After seeing the audience's dumbfounded disbelief, Max and Leo, confident that the play will be a flop, go to a bar across the street to celebrate and get drunk. Unbeknownst to them, the audience ends up finding L.S.D.'s beatnik-like portrayal (and constant ad-libbing) hilarious and misinterprets the production as a satire.During intermission, some members of the audience come to the bar at which Max and Leo are drinking and rave about the play, much to Max's and Leo's shared horror. The two decide to return to the theater after intermission to hear what the rest of the audience has to say, which echoes what the others already said.Meanwhile, L.S.D.'s portrayal of Hitler enrages and humiliates Franz, who after going behind the stage, untying the cable holding up the curtain, and rushing out on stage confronts the audience and rants about the treatment of his beloved play. However, someone behind the curtain manages to knock him out and remove him from the stage, and the audience assumes that Franz's rant was part of the act. Springtime For Hitler is declared a smash hit, which means, of course, that the investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out. Bialystock is frustrated and miserable. I was so careful, he laments. ""I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast...where did I go RIGHT?!?""As the stunned partners turn on each other, a gun-wielding Franz confronts them, accusing them of breaking the ""Siegfried Oath"". After failing to shoot Max and Leo, Franz tries to shoot himself, but runs out of bullets. Leo comforts Franz, while Max tries to convince Franz to kill the actors, but Leo intervenes. After a reconciliation, the three band together and decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are injured, arrested, tried, and found ""incredibly guilty"" by the jury. Before sentencing, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for changing his life and being his friend (while also referring to him as ""the most selfish man I have ever met in my life""), and Max tells the judge that they have learned their lesson.Max, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary. There they produce a new play called Prisoners of Love... a show which proves to be even worse than Springtime For Hitler (mostly because, this time, Leo and Max are actually striving to make a good play instead of a bad one). While Max and Franz earnestly supervise rehearsals, Leo continues their old scam - overselling shares of the play to their fellow prisoners, and even to the warden. The song ""Prisoners of Love"" plays while the credits roll."
2 or 3 Things I Know About Her,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060304/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A day in the life of a Parisian housewife/prostitute, interspersed with musings on the Vietnam War and other contemporary issues. In this film, 'Her' refers to both Paris, the character of Juliette Janson and the actress playing her, Marina Vlady. The film is a kind of dramatised documentary, illustrating and exaggerating the emotionless lives of characters in the new Paris of the 60s, where commercialism mocks families getting by on small incomes, where prostitution is a moneyspinning option, and where people are coldly resigned and immune to the human nightmares of Vietnam, and impending Atomic war.—D.Giddings <darren.giddings@newcastle.ac.uk> One day in the life of Parisienne Juliette Jeanson is presented. Married to garage employee Robert Jeanson, they with two adolescent children, Juliette generally lives a carefree life, which she is able to do on Robert's salary, but which is supplemented by her occasional daytime work, sometimes with her friend Marianne, as a prostitute, she treating that work without emotion. Her day is set within commentary by her, Robert, their children, others in their lives, random Parisians, and/or a whispering off-screen narrator (Jean-Luc Godardhimself), often breaking the fourth wall, about anything and everything from the Vietnam War to the infrastructure boom in Paris making the city more of a modern urban concrete jungle. Human existence within this global environment, both in a practical sense and an existential sense, is often at the core of that commentary.—Huggo"

Having all the time in the world, and with her days filled with nothing but meaningless social engagements, Séverine becomes increasingly fascinated by the tantalising idea of working in a Parisian brothel. Now, as her pale, firm body quivers at the very thought of being touched by perfect strangers, Séverine sets foot in Madame Anaïs' discreet establishment and plucks up the courage to work there in the afternoons. But desire can be dangerous, and swaggering, violent Marcel grows increasingly jealous and possessive. Can Belle de Jour prevent a scandal and a catastrophe?—Nick Riganas Séverine Serizy (Catherine Deneuve), is a 23 year old. beautiful, newlywed housewife, married to the respectable and uninteresting surgeon, Dr. Pierre Serizy (Jean Sorel). Despite their love for each other, Séverine is frigid and sleeps in a separate bed, rejecting his sexual advances. Her sexual life is restricted to elaborate fantasies involving dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and bondage. Although frustrated by his wife's frigidity, he respects her wishes.While visiting a ski resort, they meet two friends, Henri Husson (Michel Piccoli) and Renée (Macha Méril). Séverine does not like Husson's manner and the way he looks at her. Back in Paris, Séverine sees Renée again and learns that a mutual friend, Henriette, has turned to prostitution for money. At her home, Séverine receives roses from Husson and is unsettled by the gesture. At the tennis courts, she bumps into Husson and she asks him questions about Henriette and brothels.

He tells her he'd like to spend time with her -- without her husband being present -- but Séverine rejects his advances.Haunted by childhood memories involving her father, Séverine goes to address of the high-class brothel, leaves, and then enters, meeting Madame Anaïs (Geneviève Page). Reluctant at first, she responds to the ""firm hand"" of Madame Anaïs, who names her ""Belle de Jour,"" and has sex with her first john. After staying away for a week, incurring Madame Anaïs wrath, Séverine returns to the brothel and begins working everyday from two to five o'clock, returning to her unsuspecting husband each evening. One day Husson visits her at home, but Séverine refuses to see him, although she fantasizes about having sex with him in her husband's presence.

Casino Royale,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061452/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In an early spy spoof, aging Sir James Bond comes out of retirement to take on SMERSH. After the death of M, Sir James Bond is called back out of retirement to stop SMERSH. In order to trick SMERSH and Le Chiffre, Bond thinks up the ultimate plan: every agent shall be named James Bond. One of the Bonds, whose real name is Evelyn Tremble, is sent to take on Le Chiffre in a game of baccarat, but all of the Bonds get more than they can handle.—simon An unofficial and secret cooperative of the heads of British/French/American/Soviet intelligence try to persuade the original Sir James Bond 007 - known to be the greatest spy in history - to come out of retirement to work on a specific case: discover and stop the unknown forces that are murdering their collective agents. The womanizer who took over Sir James' name and number - who Sir James detests as sullying that good name and number by relying too much on gadgetry to get the work done - has moved onto other things, and Sir James' nebbish nephew Jimmy Bond has proved to be a disappointment as a spy and a man, and thus are not candidates for the job. Sir James politely declines, until a specific incident not only brings him out of retirement, but places him in the top job at MI6. Sir James eventually learns that it is SMERSH who is behind the murders. As such, Sir James amasses a team of agents all who are to named James Bond 007--even the women--to confuse SMERSH. Among the ranks of new James Bond 007's, each who his or own specific duty, are: Coop, who is irresistible to women but will be trained to deny those feelings in return, as it has been proved that the demise of most of the agents was due to falling prey to sex; the Detainer, a newly devised secret weapon in a truly feminine form; wealthy Vesper Lynd, a former agent whose main role is to be the recruiter and handler for the next Bond on the list; Evelyn Tremble, a baccarat master who will challenge SMERSH's financial agent, Le Chiffre, to a game at Casino Royale, this the primary means SMERSH is financed; and Mata Bond, Sir James and Mata Hara's illegitimate daughter, a dancer who will infiltrate an au pair service in East Berlin known to be a front for SMERSH's training center for their young, female operatives. Even if all the James Bond 007's are able to carry out their roles successfully, Sir James and the team will still have to discover the mastermind within SMERSH and his/her specific motive for the agent murders.—Huggo In the face of a common threat, with someone killing secret agents globally, the world's principal spy agencies decide to set their differences aside to face the new menace. So, to thwart the sinister plans of the evil criminal organisation known as SMERSH, retired legendary super-spy Sir James Bond agrees to lend a hand and return to active duty. As Bond puts his ingenious plan into effect, aiming at creating confusion, the British Secret Service enlists the help of a suave baccarat master to beat SMERSH card ace Le Chiffre at his own game. Now, greed and betrayal raise the stakes. However, the question remains. Who is behind the stealthy assassinations?—Nick Riganas The freewheeling farce begins when aging Sir James Bond is persuaded to rejoin Her Majesty's Secret Service and head an operation to smash SMERSH. His mission? Topple Le Chiffre, whose baccarat winnings support the evil organization. Before you can say ""double-oh-cross,"" enticing Vesper Lynd recruits baccarat ace Evelyn Tremble to impersonate the suave super-sleuth and confront the villain. Adding to the mayhem is Sir James' neurotic nephew, Jimmy Bond, a SMERSH defector.—Official Synopsis Casino Royale (1967)Sir James Bond (David Niven) retired at the height of his powers when forced to betray his lover Mata Hari, and now lives in an English country house, surrounded by lions, devoting himself to Debussy and cultivating black roses, attended by his butler (Erik Chitty). However, alarmed by the mounting losses of their spies, he is visited by the heads of the British ('M' or McTarry; John Huston), French (LeGrand; Charles Boyer), American (Ransome; William Holden) and Russian (Smernov; Kurt Kasznar) Secret Services (collectively driven by M's chauffer John LeMesurier), who petition him to return. He refuses, considering himself to belong to a nobler tradition, and them all gadget-ridden ""jokeshop"" spies, and deploring the handing on of his legend, name and number to a ""sexual acrobat"". Even a letter from the Queen does not sway him, and as a final desperate trick M signals for Sir James' home to be blown up by the Army: the attack also kills M (but not, apparently, the others).Smersh Authority (the villains) learns that ""Sir James Bond is back, with his morals, his vows and his celibate image. We must destroy that image"".Sir James, thus forced out of retirement, travels to Scotland, taking M's toupee (the only surviving relic or heirloom) to M's widow, Lady Fiona, who has been substituted by Smersh agent Mimi (Deborah Kerr). She explains the rituals surrounding the death of The McTarry, which include a banquet (with fresh goat haggis and lots of whisky), dancing, and a memorial grouse shoot (""Whenever a McTarry dies, the grouse come into season""). The castle is filled with beautiful girls, agents of Smersh, pretending to be M's eleven 16-19-year-old daughters (""some of us are adopted"") including Heather (Tracey Crisp) and Meg (Alexandra Bastedo), who undress Sir James for his bath (""be careful, that's my loose kneecap""), Buttercup (""Daddy's little thermometer"", Angela Scoular) whom Sir James discovers actually in his bath, as well as Eliza (Gabriella Licudi), Peg (Elaine Taylor), and Michele (Frances Cosslett).Sir James drinks all the others under the table at the banquet, but when later approached by Mimi in his bedroom claiming he ""comfort her"" as her ""widow's due"", upon rejecting her, she calls him a ""ninnogaywillycouf"" and summons the pipers for a 'worzle', a contest which involves picking up and attempting to throw large stone cannonballs. This he wins, largely as the five pipers (Robin, Jock, Sandy: Bob Godfrey, Percy Herbert) injure themselves in trying to pick up the balls, whereas he manages to pick one up, throw it and catch it. Mimi is so impressed the other girls decide she is a risk and lock her in her room.At the grouse shoot, one of Sir James' cape buttons has been substituted with a homing beacon, and the girls send rocket-launched explosive-laden dummy grouse towards him. Assisted by Mimi, who has escaped down the rather unsafe drainpipe from her room, Sir James uses his braces to fire the button back into the rocket launcher, blowing it up. Mimi, injured, wins a farewell kiss from Sir James (""Madam, are you quite sure you're dying?"") before entering a convent, and tells him that their orders came from ""Authority: International Mothers' Help, East Berlin"" (1).Driving back from Scotland, Sir James is trailed by a remote-controlled booby-trapped milk float (control girl Penny Riley), but manages to escape so that it kills yet another Smersh agent (). In London, he takes over as head of the British Secret Service, whose only surviving members are his secretary Miss Moneypenny (or rather her daughter; Barbara Bouchet), and his assistant Hadley (or rather his son; Derek Nimmo), who explain that all the secret agents apart from Sir James' replacement (now doing television) have been killed in sexually suggestive situations (""stabbed to death in a ladies sauna bath"", ""burnt in a blazing bordello"", ""garrotted in a geisha house"", etc.) with the possible exception of Sir James' nephew, Jimmy Bond (Woody Allen), last seen in the Caribbean escaping a firing squad (""I have a very low threshold of death"") with an exploding cigarette, only to end up in front of another firing squad. Sir James decides to call up all the auxiliary staff, and to create the ultimate 'Anti-Female Spy Device' - a man whom all women desire, but who is indifferent to them. Miss Moneypenny is tasked with finding one such (""your mother did some of her best work at night""), and she finds Cooper ('Coop': Terence Cooper: ""Sounds like something for keeping birds."" ""That's me""). Coop, a holder of the 'Kama Sutra Black Belt', is then sent for his anti-female training, against a gym-full of a variety of exotic, exotically dressed Bond girls (Yvonne Marsh, Veronica Gardnier - there are over 200 beautiful girls in the film), overcoming them all but eventually meeting new secret weapon The Detainer (Daliah Lavi), who also becomes 007 (""I don't do anything, but, unless you're one of them, you do""), Sir James having decided that to create confusion all agents, both male and female, will become 'James Bond, 007'.Sir James personally recruits two new 007 spies. The first is wealthy Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress: assistant Valentine Dyall), who Sir James persuades using a £5m tax arrears demand (2). Vesper is given the task of approaching and recruiting Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers: ""Isn't Evelyn a girl's name? No, its mine""), an expert in baccarat at the Buckingham Club, whom Sir James wants to use to defeat Smersh's treasurer, Le Chiffre (Orson Welles), currently gambling with Smersh's money at Casino Royale. She does this, seducing Tremble at her Mayfair flat (to which she has lately had Nelson's Column removed) and also encouraging him to dress up in a number of costumes (including Napoleon - complete with 'Sunny Elba' pamphlet - Hitler and Toulouse-Lautrec: ""Come on, you have more to do"". ""More?!""). Tremble, now also James Bond, 007, goes to Q (Geoffrey Bayldon) and his fey assistant Fordyce (John Wells) in their cellars full of inept inventions (where he is also shadowed by a dwarf dressed as a garden gnome ""He's our security man"") for his fitting with a gadget-filled suit (""a little bit tight about the..."" ""Poison capsule compartment?"").Sir James then recruits his own daughter by Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet), currently working as a living Eastern goddess (""Celestial Virgin of the Sacred Altar"" ""Figuratively speaking, of course"": temple guard Milton Reid, monk John Hollis): there is a superb temple dance sequence. Mata Bond is sent to West Berlin by London taxicab (taxicab driver Bernard Cribbins) to infiltrate International Mothers' Help, known to be a Smersh cover for the Mata Hari School of Dancing, a spy training school, with rather complex neo-Cubist décor, presided over by the formidable Frau Hoffner (Anna Quale) and the diminutive Polo (Ronnie Corbett). Revealing her identity as Mata Hari's daughter, she is shown by Polo to her mother's old room (""What an enormous bed!"" ""The German army was very large in those days""), where she discovers a secret passageway activated by the cistern, which leads to a projection suite: she also discovers 'little Otto' one of her mother's lovers (""Is he dead?"" ""Hard to tell. He always looked like that""). She learns that Le Chiffre is, via his agent (Vladek Sheybal) auctioning his art collection of blackmail photographs to raise money: the auction in the auditorium is attended by officers from the British (Jack Gwilliam, Richard Wattis), Chinese (Burt Kwouk), American (Hal Galili) and Russian armies. Warned by the taxi-driver (revealed as Carlton-Towers of the Foreign Office) to prevent Le Chiffre raising the money, as the bidding for the first lot escalates (""Seventy million tons of rice!"" ""Sixty tons of caviar!""), Mata returns to the projection room, seizes the case of projector slides and flushes them away: she then escapes Polo by unplugging his external heart battery, Frau Hoffner is shot by Otto, and Mata, using a foam fire-extinguisher on the assorted military, makes good her escape with Carlton-Towers (first trying a drain, but on hearing 'What's New, Pussycat', by taxi back to London). Le Chiffre's agent, telephoning him to report his failure, and that Smersh's leader Dr. Noah now knows what Le Chiffre has been up to, is blown up in his telephone box (the explosion also destroys part of the Berlin Wall).Tremble now travels to Casino Royale, where after meeting Matthis, a French inspector of police (with an improbable Scots accent; Duncan Macrae (3)) , and having a car-wash with many eavesdroppers (yet more beautiful girls), in his room meets Miss Goodthighs (Jacqueline Bisset) ""the management of the Hotel Tropical present their compliments"" who attempts to drug him with doped champagne. Vesper arrives, 'takes care of' Miss Goodthighs, and rouses Tremble.Vesper and Tremble go the Casino: they deposit £100,000 (cashier Graham Stark) and then meet the casino director Slimmington-Jones (Colin Gordon) in his office. Tremble spots that Le Chiffre is using infra-red spectacles to cheat: Vesper steals these: Le Chiffre shows off with some magic (assistants Jennifer Baker, Susan Baker), and then Tremble and Le Chiffre play a very-high-stakes baccarat game (50 million francs: ~£3.6m or $10m at the time), which Tremble ultimately wins. Tremble takes his winnings as a cheque drawn on a Swiss bank.On the way out of the Casino, Vesper is kidnapped: Tremble, advised of this by the doorman (John Bluthal) follows in a racing car (the racing car driver Sterling Moss, as himself, having run off) but is also captured by Le Chiffre, who wants the cheque. Placed in a very elaborate but broken chair in Le Chiffre's dungeon, he suffers torture - not physical, but mental - eventually becoming a Scot in full Highland costume attacked by four Scots marching bands (including Peter O'Toole), he is rescued by Vesper using a machine gun disguised as bagpipes, who then, however, betrays and kills him (and presumably takes the cheque: ""Never trust a rich spy'). Le Chiffre is then killed by Smersh agents sent by Dr. Noah.Back in London, Sir James goes to see the Prime Minister, leaving Mata to sight-see (""Mummy would have taken me in"" ""Mummy took everyone in""): she is captured by a Household Cavalry officer () on horseback and taken by flying saucer, which lands on the now-vacated site of Nelson's Column, to Casino Royale, where, it is now revealed, the secret headquarters of Smersh's leader Dr. Noah are located (announcer Valentine Dyall). Advised of this by former agent Mimi, now a nun collecting donations (""This department has always been very helpful to needy girls"") Sir James and Moneypenny follow to Casino Royale: attacked in the casino director's room (which is a lift connecting to Dr. Noah's HQ, activated by pushing the eye of a stuffed tiger) they eventually win through to an audience hall with chairs made of gold ingots to see Dr. Noah himself - who turns out to be Sir James' missing nephew, Jimmy Bond. Jimmy is however speechless in his uncle's presence: ""I never should have let Nellie send him to progressive school... I'm beginning to think you're a trifle neurotic"". Dr. Noah/Jimmy reveals part of his plans (using a taped message); to release a bacillus which will leave all women beautiful and all men shorter than himself; and then hits a gong to summon his staff and have Sir James and Moneypenny incarcerated.Dr. Noah then reveals to The Detainer, whom he has also captured, stripped and strapped down to a couch (""I learnt that in the Boy Scouts""), his desire to outshine his uncle, and the rest of his plans: to substitute robot doubles for all world leaders (some of which he has already done). He also shows her a pill he has invented, which ""looks like an aspirin, it tastes like an aspirin, but it is not an aspirin"" - it is in fact an atomic bomb, which goes off after 400 chain reactions. Feigning interest in him, she is released, steals the pill, and manages to slip it into his champagne, and he starts his hiccup-visualized countdown.Sir James, Mata, Moneypenny and Coop (captured earlier) now manage to escape the psychedelically-decorated room in which they have been imprisoned (using exploding 'vaporized lysergic acid' (4)), and making their way back to the audience hall (""Super place for a coming-out party"") and meeting up with The Detainer, find their way back to the Casino (with the aid of Frankenstein's monster: David Prowse). Whilst The Detainer escapes, Sir James tries to call London for aid, but is stopped by Vesper; ""Dear Vesper. The things you do for money"": who has, however, apparently fallen in love with him, and everything that has happened has been a plan to lure him to her at Casino Royale. He overpowers her, and then he and the remaining James Bonds initiate an attack on the Smersh agents in the Casino, aided by the French (Jean-Paul Belmondo: translates 'Merde!' as 'Ouch') and the Americans, both horse-riding Cowboys and tomahawk-wielding Red Indians (air-dropped with tepees as parachutes: Ransome reappears also): George Raft (as himself) shots himself during the affray, and the Keystone Cops have a cameo. Dr. Noah appears with the final chain-reaction countdown hiccups, and the Casino is explosively completely destroyed, killing all five remaining James Bonds (Sir James, Coop, Vesper, Mata, Moneypenny), as well as Dr. Noah/Jimmy Bond. The closing song explains that six James Bonds (including Tremble) go to ""a heavenly spot"", Jimmy to ""a place where it's terribly hot"").Notes:
(1) For younger readers: During the Cold War, the city of Berlin was divided by the Berlin Wall (1961-1989) into West Berlin (under Allied control: the Wall surrounded this) and East Berlin (under Soviet control). One of the motifs of the film is that the International Mothers' Help building straddles the border, this being reflected in the interior décor and lighting, and a symbolic rope bisecting the auditorium.
(2) In 1967, £5m was half of art auctioneers Christie's annual turnover. Nowadays (2009) it buys 10% of a Titian.
(3) There is also a brief pre-credits scene where Tremble (as James Bond) and the Inspector meet in a pissoir
(4) Lysergic acid is a precursor for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD - very Sixties). As its melting point is 240oC, and its (theoretical) vaporization point considerably higher (it degrades), a certain technical liberty is taken by considering it to be an explosive vapour collectable in a seat-cushion-cover in the film(Original version retained below - fades a bit to the end)Any movie directed by 5 different people is bound
to be confusing. This is, off course, no exception.The movie starts off with James Bond (Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers)) meeting Lieutenant Mathis
(Duncan Macrae) of the Special Police in a pissouir in Paris. After Bond checks Mathis' credentials, he follows him out.The credits roll.4 cars come in from different directions - a Citroen, a Cadilac, a Bently, and what appears to be something Russian. The 4 chaufers wait by their cars as the 4 passengers get into a Rolls Royce, driven by a fifth chaufer.Through conversations between M (McTarry (John Huston)), Ransome (William Holden), Le Grand (Charles Boyer), and Smernov (Kurt Kasznar), we learn that this is the home of the original James Bond. He is pure of mind and body. They property is protected by many lions.James is exercising as the gentlemen arrive. He has a stutter. He complains that the agent that replaced him as James Bond 007 is leaving a trail of dead women behind; that the new gadgets have taken the honour from the profession.He takes them outside to show them his black rose. Each spy head complains that they are losing agents at an alarming rate. They want James to come out of retirement to fix their shared problems.James interrupts them to play some Debussy. We learn that Bond retired because he had to lure his lover, Mata Hari, to her death. He returns from playing. M shows him a letter from the Queen. Still, he refuses the request to return to duty. M lights a cigar as a signal, and British troops bomb the property. His mansion is destroyed and M's toupee is blown off.Cut to a Smersh control room. We hear the head of Smersh (Authority) tell them that James Bond is back, with his morals, vows, and celebate image in tact. He tells them to initiate Plan B to attempt to destroy that image.We see James driving his Morgan (?) through the British countryside into Scotland. Various spys report his progress. We learn that he is heading for M's (McTarry's) castle. Plan B is in operation with Agent Mimi taking the place of M's widow (Lady Fiona) because she has the best Scot's accent.Sir James presents the remains of M to Lady Fiona (Deborah Kerr). They explain that they'd heard of the death from the Grey Piper. The room is full of women, mourning. They prepare a traditional hagis feast for midnight, where they will dance the traditional Scotish Fling and drink Ouskabar. It is explained (there's a lot of explaining going on, but it really doesn't help) that they drink until they drop in their tracks, then after an hour's rest, the piper awakes them for the morning grouse shoot.James is shown to his room, where Meg and Heather help him undress for his bath. The room is full of paintings of nude women. Meg and Heather tell him that they are 2 of M's 11 daughters - all between the ages of 16 and 19. As they walk down the hall to the bath, they walk past a series of bedrooms, each with a gorgeous girl peering out.James goes into the bath room and starts to undress, when he notices that 17 year old Buttercup is in the tub - testing the water temperature (""Daddy's little thermometer""). She invites him in to scrub his back. James has to turn on the cold water to avoid certain embarassment.Cut to James' room, where we see Meg and Heather swapping a button on his coat - but they are speaking French! We learn that the button is to be used only as a last resort - that Mimi's never failed before.At the hagis feast, everyone is drinking scotch. Two girls have their legs entwined with James at the table, as he listens to Mimi pass on some of the McTarry folklore. Everyone eventually passes out except James, who takes his cup and the scotch decanter up to his room.He's enjoying a nightcap as Mimi comes in and declares ""her Widow's Due"", insisting that James ""doodle her"". He refuses, so she insists that he ""pay the piper"". She blows a silly trumpet solo on a hunting horn, and calls the huge Scottish pipers in. They are going to ""wassle"" - play catch with heavy stone cannon balls.The first 5 do themselves in trying to lift and throw the balls. The sixth manages a throw that James catches and throws back. The piper catches the ball, but the weight forces him back, into an armour display, which falls on him and knocks him out. James then picks up the last wassle ball and karate chops it in 2. Mimi is stricken. She praises him in French, blowing her cover. The other girls realize, and lock Mimi in her room.The next morning, James is out for the grouse shoot. Mimi's locked in her room, and realizes that James is in trouble. The truck that brought the beaters is actually a launcher of exploding grouse. Mimi escapes by sliding down a drainpipe outside her window, and come to warn James that the button on his coat is actually a homing device. He shoots the grouse before they can get too close, and tells Mimi to take off his braces. They use them like a slingshot to fire the button back towards the beaters. The beaters use a garter belt to fling the homing button back. James grabs the return shot, and Mimi is able to fire it into the grouse launcher. Mimi is injured, and commits herself to a nunnery. She tells James that they are run by International Mother's Help in Berlin.James leaves the McTarry estate, but is followed by a woman driving an E-Type Jaguar. The women in the Smersh control room activate a rigged milk truck. Through some tricky driving, James gets in front of the Jag, and the milk truck loses its visual feed to Control. Control has to set the truck to automatic. James drives into his gated estate and gets the gate closed as the Jag spins into them. The milk truck plows into the Jag, and they both explode.James shows up at MI5, sees Moneypenny, and gives her a big kiss. Moneypenny enjoys it, but explains that she is actually Moneypenny's daughter. James is on a mission, and has lost his stammer. He meets Hadley, who is also the son of the original Hadley.Hadley goes over the state of MI5's agents. Most have been lured to their death by enemy women agents. The replacement James Bond has quit to ""do television"". James' nephew, Jimmy Bond was working as a spy in the Caribbean, but hasn't been heard from in a while. In a flashback, we see Jimmy (Woody Allen) about to face a firing squad. He escapes using an exploding cigarette.James assigns Moneypenny to find a replacement 007 agent that is desireable to women, but can be trained to resist them. She selects agent Cooper, and spends the night confirming that he is good with women.

Young adults Bonnie Parker, a waitress, and Clyde Barrow, a criminal just released from prison, are immediately attracted to what the other represents for their life when they meet by chance in West Dallas, Texas. Bonnie is fascinated with Clyde's criminal past, and his matter-of-factness and bravado in talking about it. Clyde sees in Bonnie someone sympathetic to his goals. Although attracted to each other physically, a sexual relationship between the two has obstacles. They decide to join forces to embark on a life of crime, holding up whatever establishments, primarily banks, to make money and to have fun. They don't plan on hurting anyone or killing despite wielding loaded guns. They amass a small gang of willing accomplices, including C.W. Moss, a mechanic to fix whatever cars they steal which is important especially for their getaways, and Buck Barrow, one of Clyde's older brothers. The only reluctant tag-along is Buck's nervous wife, Blanche Barrow, a preacher's daughter. The gang's life changes after the first fatal shot is fired. After that, their willingness to shoot to kill increases to protect themselves and their livelihood. Their notoriety precedes them, so much so that no matter what one's opinion is of them, most want to have some association to the Barrow gang, to help them, to be spoken in the same breath as them, or to capture and or kill them. Of the many people they encounter in their crime spree, the one who may have the most profound effect on their lives is Texas Ranger, Frank Hamer, who seeks retribution.—Huggo Bonnie Parkeris bored with life and wants a change. She gets her chance when she meets a charming young drifter by the name ofClyde Barrow. Clyde has dreams of a life of crime that will free him from the hardships of the Depression. The two fall in love and begin a crime spree that extends from Oklahoma to Texas. They rob small banks with skill and panache, soon becoming minor celebrities known across the country. People are proud to have been held up by Bonnie and Clyde; to their victims, the duo is doing what nobody else has the guts to do. To the law, the two are evil bank robbers who deserve to be gunned down where they stand.—filmfactsman Clyde Barrow, recently out of prison, has turned to bank robbery. He meetsBonnie Parkerand together the two form the nucleus of a gang of bank robbers who terrorize the southwest in the 1920s. Based on the true story of a pair of notorious bank robbers, the film personalizes them while still showing the violence that went along with them.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Adrift in the Depression-era Southwest,Clyde BarrowandBonnie Parkerembark on a life of crime. They mean no harm. They crave adventure -- and each other. Soon we start to love them too. But nothing in film history has prepared us for the cascading violence to follow. Bonnie and Clyde turns brutal. We learn they can be hurt -- and dread they can be killed.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> In the middle of the Great Depression, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker meet when Clyde tries to steal Bonnie's mother's car. Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued with Clyde, and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime. They do some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative.The duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss. The three are joined by Clyde's brother, Buck and his wife, Blanche, a preacher's daughter. Soon a long-simmering feud between Bonnie and Blanche begins; the once-prim Blanche views Bonnie as a harpy corrupting her husband and brother-in-law, while Bonnie sees Blanche as an incompetent, shrill shrew.Bonnie and Clyde turn from pulling small-time heists to robbing banks. Their exploits also become more violent. When C.W., the get-away driver, botches a bank robbery by parallel parking the car, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face after he jumps onto the slow-moving car's running board. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, including Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, who is captured and humiliated by the outlaws, then set free. After a raid kills Buck, injures Bonnie and Clyde, and leaves Blanche sightless and in police custody, Hamer tricks Blanche, whose eyes are bandaged, into revealing the name of C.W. Moss, known in the press only as an unnamed accomplice.The Ranger locates Bonnie, Clyde and C.W. hiding at the house of C.W.'s father, who thinks Bonnie and Clyde -- and an elaborate tattoo -- have corrupted his son. He strikes a bargain with Hamer: in exchange for a lenient jail sentence for C.W., he helps set a trap for the outlaws. When Bonnie and Clyde are ambushed while stopped by the side of the road, the police riddle their bodies with bullets in a blood bath."

As more and more students reach their homes, the only ones left traveling are Khoma Brut [Leonid Kuravlev] and his two friends, Khaliava [Vadim Zakharchenko] and Gorobetz [Vladimir Salnikov]. As evening approaches, it becomes foggy and the road has disappeared, so they start looking for a place where they can spend the night and get a glass of vodka. Just when it looks like they're going to be forced to spend the night under the stars, they come to a house. An old woman [ Nikolai Kutuzov] answers their knocks on the gate.

The Rector informs Khoma that he has been contacted by a famous Sotnik [Aleksei Glazyrin] living near Kiev.

Against his will, Khoma goes along with the servants sent by the Sotnik to fetch him. It's a long drive in a horse-drawn wagon, and Khoma tries to get away several times. Each time he is prevented from leaving by the servants. Yet, when he asks the servants why the girl needs to have such solemn prayers said for the deliverance of her soul, they are strangely silent.When Khoma gets to the Solnik's house, he learns that Pannochka, has requested that he, Khoma Brut, say prayers over her for three nights in a row. Kohma is roundly questioned by the dead girl's father about his chastity, but Khoma denies ever knowing her that way. The vigil is set to start that night. Pannochka's body is moved into the church, and Khoma is served dinner, during which the villagers tell stories about how Pannochka has bewitched men in the past. Later that evening, Khoma is locked in the church where Pannochka's body is lying in state. He lights candles to chase away the gloom, sets up a pedestal, and begins to pray.

For the rest of the night, until cockcrow, Khoma prays as Pannochka searches the room and circles the pedestal looking for a way to get to him.The next day, Khoma eats his borscht and, when asked how the night went, he admits only to hearing some noises. Calling himself a Cossack, he convinces himself that Cossacks have no fear. When night comes, armed with a bit of vodka, Khoma bravely agrees to be holed up in the church for his second night. He again draws a circle and begins his prayers. Pannochka awakens and, for the rest of the night, she circles the room, riding in her coffin, looking for Khoma and calling out his name. At cockcrow, she again returns to her coffin.Day three. Khoma emerges from the church, dancing and singing mindlessly until he takes off his hat and the villagers notice that his hair has turned white. Khoma pleads with the Solnik to let him return home, but the Solnik offers him a thousand pieces of gold or a thousand lashes. Once more, Khoma tries to escape the village, but he is met by two Cossacks who stop him. Armed with several flasks of vodka, Khoma enters the church for night three. Once again, Khoma draws his circle and begins his prayers. This night, however, Pannochka summons demons from hell. They rise from the floors, crawl out of the walls, and drop from the ceilings. Then, Pannochka summons the big demon, Viy. Viy points his finger at Khoma and directs all the other demons to get him. The demons penetrate the circle and jump on Khoma.When the villagers open the church doors at sunrise, they find Khoma dead. Back at the Seminary, Khoma's friends Khaliava and Gorobetz discuss Khoma's desmise. Their conclusion: Khoma didn't have enough faith in God. Or maybe he had too much vodka.

The meeting, initiated by Dick, is to plan and eventually carry out a robbery based on information he had received from a fellow inmate about $10,000 cash being locked in a hidden safe in the home of the farming Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas. After the robbery, they plan on going to Mexico permanently to elude capture by the police. Each brings a necessary personality to the partnership to carry out the plan, Dick who is the brash manipulator, Perry the outwardly more sensitive but unrealistic dreamer with a violent streak under the surface. Perry literally carries all his dreams in a large box he takes with him wherever he goes. The robbery does not go according to plan in any respect, the pair who ultimately hogtie and execute all four members of the Clutter family, only coming away from the home with $43 in cash. As Perry and Dick go on the run, a murder investigation ensues, led by Topeka based Detective Alvin Dewey. If Dewey and his team are able eventually to identify the pair as the murderers and capture them, they, if they understand the two, may get their much needed confessions in dividing and conquering. Perry and Dick's fates may also be regardless of who literally pulled the trigger.—Huggo Two young men are ineffectual individually, but when together become violent criminals. They break into a wealthy farmer's home only to find that there is nearly no money at the home and murder the entire family to avoid identification. The first part of the film details the search for them, the second, their trial and execution. Taken from the actual events chronicled by Truman Capote in his book.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Truman Capote wrote the 'non-fiction novel' from which the film is drawn, using the novelist's craft to render reality. The reality was that at two a.m. on November 15, 1959 in the rural town of Holcomb, Kansas, the four members of the Clutter family were roused from their sleep, bound and gagged, and then brutally murdered by two unknown assailants. After the latters' capture, sentencing and imprisonment prior to execution, Capote researched the case thoroughly, spent weeks talking with the prisoners, Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, jurors, police, friends and neighbors, trying to unearth why such a senseless act was committed, and what society's response might have been.—filmfactsman November 13, 1959.Perry Smith (Robert Blake), a dwarfish, dreamy, soft-spoken man of Cherokee Indian and Dutch descent has been paroled from prison for the past few months. He's on a Greyhound Bus drifting from an unknown location to Kansas City, Missouri and strumming his guitar. A little girl is fascinated by his strumming, but after he spots her, she walks away. He is to meet up with an old prison buddy, Willie Jay. But he's also expecting to meet with Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson), another former prison buddy from the local area that had written him a letter about a ""perfect score"" they could make in western Kansas and that he will meet him at the bus terminal.Dick Hickock is a charming young man from a simple farm family that own a small tract of land and live just outside of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. His father is ill and dying of cancer. He informs his father that is coughing badly outside the outhouse that he will get them a better place. With his rifle in the backseat of his 1949 Chevrolet, he is ready to pick up Perry and begin his journey.At the Greyhound terminal in Kansas City, Perry phones the prison chaplain, Reverend James Post (Sheldon Allman), inquiring about his friend Willie Jay. Perry is upset that he has not yet been released from prison and the chaplain warns him not to set foot into Kansas, since his parole has a condition that he is not to do so.Out in western Kansas in the town of Holcomb, near Garden City, we are introduced of a prosperous farmer by the name of Herbert Clutter (John McLiam) and his family. He is a healthy, vigorous, kindly, yet straitlaced man of 48 years of age that has never used tobacco, alcohol, or caffeine in his life and having a glass of milk for breakfast. His beautiful and sweet 16-year-old daughter gives him a morning kiss informing him of her busy day ahead and he finds his 15-year-old son Kenyon down in the basement, who is sneaking a smoke and painting a box for his older sister's wedding. Herbert smells the smoke and pretends he doesn't know Kenyon is doing it, but knows and dismisses it. Herbert's wife Bonnie is an ailing and frail woman suffering psychosomatic illness and bedridden much of the time.Back at the Kansas City bus terminal, Perry is in the washroom treating his badly scarred knee that he got years ago from a motorcycle accident. Afterwards, he looks in the mirror and imagines himself performing in Las Vegas in a nightclub with empty chairs, but then Dick notices him and gets him out of his trance. They leave the terminal.Dick and Perry are on Interstate 670 entering Kansas. Perry has now broken parole entering Kansas. Dick informs him of the ""perfect score"" about a rich farmer in western Kansas named Herbert Clutter that he was tipped off on by a former prison buddy, Floyd Wells. He was told that Clutter had a safe with probably $10,000 in it and that they could rob it and leave no witnesses, killing everybody in sight. We get to know these two people, Perry, a quiet, introspective, dreamy, but mentally unstable young man and Dick, less intellectual, but more masculine and practical. Dick assures Perry that it was okay he didn't meet up with Willie Jay, because he is ""a flaming faggot"".On November 14, after driving all night, Perry and Dick stop at a hardware store in Emporia purchasing duct tape, rubber gloves, and nylon rope for their victims. At the checkout stand, Dick steals a package of razor blades. They regret not having purchased nylon stockings (so they can use to put over their heads to disguise their faces), but Perry said maybe they could go to a Catholic church and get them after seeing nuns. Dick jokes and says, ""yeah, we'll just go barge in like it was a five and dime store"".During the long trip, we simultaneously see the everyday life of the Clutter family and Perry and Dick traveling. Herbert is writing a check to an insurance salesman for $40,000 in case anything happens to him and they have a television repairman come. Perry and Dick stop at a hamburger stand, Perry dreams of his childhood growing up with his Dutch father and Cherokee mother having rodeos all over the southwest, and they arrive in Garden City and stop at a Fina gas station to refuel. Perry is in the washroom gobbling aspirin and wincing from the pain in his leg and Dick steals some snacks at the counter while his car is being fueled. The Clutter family is about to go to bed and soon afterwards, Perry and Dick arrive at the Clutter house in Holcomb. Perry said they should split and not do this, but Dick talks him into it. They are both slightly drunk.The next morning (November 15), a friend of Nancy's and her parents are repeatedly ringing the doorbell at the Clutter home, but nobody answers. They cautiously enter the home. The girls father finds a severed phone cord and the girl is screaming. Afterwards, police cars and ambulances arrive at the Clutter home to take away the bodies. The postmistress, Sadie Truitt, is surprised at what's going on.Perry is asleep at a hotel in Olathe and Dick is at his parents modest home eating. He asks his father what happened to the basketball game and told it got interrupted because of a murder that happened in Garden City that's on the news. Dick jokes and declares he's never been so hungry in his life.FBI Agent Alvin Dewey (John Forsythe) has been in charge of the case and is a local resident. He and another agent, Roy Church (John Gallaudet), have been dispatched to investigate the scene. They are trying to recover fingerprints and Dewey can't find a clue as to why they have been robbed, because Herbert Clutter never kept large sums of cash on him and did everything by check. They are later at the courthouse in Garden City seeing a slide show of bloody footprints seen of two different kinds of shoes and Dewey informs the men that the press do not get the information. After reviewing the slideshow, Dewey insists he will give only facts, mainly that Herbert Clutter's throat was cut and that the women were not molested. He meets up with a stern, but friendly and easygoing reporter, named Bill Jensen (Paul Stewart) ( supposedly based on the writer Truman Capote). They converse alone in the courtroom and can't figure out the case, but Dewey informs him the two older daughters will get the insurance, even though it was written the same night of the murder. Agent Church is at the Clutter home with the housekeeper and she discovers that Kenyon's radio is missing.Back at the Olathe Hotel, Perry and Dick are listening to the investigation on Kenyon's radio. Perry is disgusted that Dick's prison buddy Floyd Wells lied to him about the money and feels that the story is not true about no clues as to who did the crime. Dick tells him to quit worrying, even though he's a witness.Prisoner Floyd Wells hears the report of the Clutter murders on the radio and is surprised at the $1,000r reward for anybody that has any clue of them. But still the agents have no clue of it. Yet somehow they knew that over $40 in cash was stolen.Meanwhile about two days later, Perry and Dick are shopping in Kansas City, Kansas. Dick plans to write a lot of bad checks for a fitted suit for Perry, whom he says is about to get married, an expensive ring, camera, and a television set. Afterwards they leave and are on their way to Mexico to never come back, hoping to score there.Over the next few weeks, the investigation continues with men dragging a river near the Clutter home to search for the murder weapon. No success. Dewey and Agent Clarence Duntz go back to the Clutter home and find a man staying there they believe to be a suspect, but instead he turns out to be an escaped mental patient occupying the place.Dewey and Bill Jensen meet at Hartman's Cafe, a small restaurant in Holcomb managed by Bess Hartman, a sassy, no-nonsense woman. Dewey receives an immediate phone call there from Harold Nye, another agent assigned to the case, with a phone call from Lansing, Kansas from Logan Sanford, head of Kansas Bureau of Investigation. There is a confession from Floyd Wells, Dick Hickcok's former cellmate about Floyd being a former hired man for Clutter and how he told Dick about Clutter's place and all the money and a safe that he had and that Dick wanted to rob the place. He explains how Dick was obsessed with the Clutter home, but never took him seriously. Sanford insists on a pickup for parole violation for Hickock and that he's also wanted for passing hot checks.Perry and Dick cross the border from Laredo, Texas into Mexico, believing they are now safe and sound and off to live the good life.Somewhere in Nevada in an auto junkyard with a decrepit trailer, Agents Dewey and Church meet with Tex Smith (Charles McGraw), a man nicknamed ""The Lone Wolf"" a reclusive, eccentric, yet courteous 60-ish man that is the father of Perry. They inquire of Perry's whereabouts and if he's seen him, but he says he has not seen Perry since his stint in prison, but they do the math and realize he hasn't seen Perry in years. Smith does most of the talking about Perry's background that he feels he learned his lesson and always taught his kids to be truthful, enterprising, sober, and independent, but that his wife that was a Cherokee Indian that took to drunkenness, sleeping with young men, and the kids living with that and that he put a stop to it. Also telling them of the story when Perry joined him in Alaska after getting out of the Army to prospect gold and building a lodge. The agents find the interview pointless in getting Perry captured and leave.Meanwhile, Perry and Dick are living in a decrepit motel somewhere in Mexico. Perry believes that if they sell the car and buy some deep sea diving gear, they can get the buried treasures in the Yucatan Peninsula to get the Cortez jackpot. However, Dick being practical and realistic tells Perry to forget about it and that he's selling his car for $120 to pay their hotel bill, bar, food, and get a bus ticket to Barstow, California. Much to Perry's extreme disappointment, Dick tells him to knock it off, stop dreaming, and that it's all made up.Dewey and Bill Jensen are back at the Clutter home still trying to find out the motive of the murders. Even with a newspaper article written about how such an incident could happen months before, they still can't figure it out. But Dewey insists that once they are found, they'll hang.In Mexico, Dick is enjoying himself at the hotel with a prostitute, while Perry is packing his belongings. Perry takes a glimpse of the prostitute and she reminds him of his own mother. He has flashbacks of his mother sleeping with a younger man and drunk while he and his siblings look on. His father catches his mother in the act throwing the man out, slapping her bare back with a belt, and pouring her alcohol all over her back. It's made evident Perry had a very traumatic and unhappy childhood, despite his love and devotion for both of his parents and siblings.Another weeks or so later in mid December 1959, Perry and Dick are somewhere in the California desert hitching a ride. Dick comes up with a plan that Perry sit in the backseat and when Dick asks him to pass him a match, Perry take his belt to garrote the driver and rob him. An elderly man in a jeep stops, but then drives away and changes his mind. Then an African American man (Rosey Grier; a black football star of the Los Angeles Rams) and a friend of his offer them a ride in his pink Cadillac, but they refuse (aware that the two ""negros"" will intend to rob them). They end up taking a ride with a traveling salesman they form a friendly relationship with. Dick asks Perry to pass him a match, but just as Perry is about to garrote the salesman, the man stops the car to pick up a soldier hitchhiking for Christmas.Agent Harold Nye is at the homestead of Walter Hickock, father of Dick, and discovers a 12 gauge shotgun he suspects is the murder weapon. Mr. Hickock tells the man he can't understand how Dick would ever commit such a crime and tells the detective about Dick's history that he's still a good man despite what has happened, but the detective seems disinterested at the testimony and takes the weapon.Perry and Dick end up at a barn in a farmhouse somewhere in Iowa and discover a Pontiac convertible with the keys in it and steal the car. Afterwards, they decide to pass a lot of bad checks in Kansas City and swap license plates to avoid detection. Agent Duntz is in Kansas City and got a report of them buying two tires with a bad check at an auto parts store from a worried clerk and tells Dewey about it. They intend to meet Perry and Dick at the Hickock farm. Duntz is going to meet them at the Hickock farm. Perry and Dick are just about to cross into Kansas through a toll booth, but detect a police car. Perry turns the steering wheel around and he and Dick and go back before approaching the toll booth.Back in Garden City, Alvin Dewey is studying a map of Kansas about their possible travel route, then telephoned that Perry and Dick have eluded detection. He can't figure out why they came back to Kansas, otherwise.December 30, 1959.Somewhere in the desert southwest, Perry and Dick pick up a boy and his grandfather. Dick is reluctant, but Perry insists on doing it. They go through it and the boy tells them if they pick up a bunch of old soda bottles, they can make some money. They end up picking up numerous bottles. By the time they drop off the boy and his grandfather in Las Vegas, they make over six dollars from it. Perry and Dick are in good spirits and want to gamble the five dollars. Perry picks up his belongings from the local post office he has picked up from Mexico. Before they can go to the casinos, they are pulled over and arrested by local police.Perry and Dick are in the Las Vegas jail and informed they have visitors. Church and Nye are interviewing Hickock and Dewey and Duntz and interviewing Smith. They are initially believed to think they are being charged with passing a series of hot checks and driving a stolen vehicle, but subconsciously realize they are being investigated about the Clutter murders. Both of them are in separate interrogation rooms making up a story that Perry was to go to Fort Scott to get money from his sister, but it turned out she moved, then they slept with a couple of prostitutes in Kansas City that they don't remember the names of. After Dick is inquired about the Clutter murder case, he flies off the handle. But they know Dick is lying about going to Fort Scott because Perry's sister never lived there and the post office is closed Saturday. Perry is told directly by Duntz directly he killed the Clutter family that day. Dick feels they are putting him on, but after they show him proof of the footprints, he spills the beans and admits Perry did all the killing. Dick faints afterwards.The next day, Perry and Dick are taken from the Las Vegas jail to Garden City, Kansas. Perry tells Alvin Dewey the story of what happened that night......In a long flashback to the early morning hours of November 15, Perry and Dick reluctantly entered the house and did not find the safe, took Herbert Clutter and his son Kenyon down to the basement, with Nancy and the mother upstairs tied up. After a lot of frustration and finding only a small sum of cash, Perry's legs are hurting him and he has a flashback of his father pulling a gun on him saying ""I'm the last living thing you're ever going to see"". He cut Herbert Clutter's throat, then shot him, then Kenyon, Bonnie, and Nancy Clutter. Perry concludes that his murder of the Clutter's was not personal, he just did it and thought Herbert Clutter was a very nice man.The next day, they arrive in Garden City, Kansas at the courthouse and both are jailed. Sometime later (in March 1960), their court case is presented by the prosecutor (Will Geer) as a motive simply for money and that they need the death penalty, because life imprisonment would mean possible parole in seven years. He also quotes The Ten Commandments ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"". Both Perry and Dick are found guilty of murder and under state Kansas law (at that time) carries a mandatory death sentence by hanging.Perry and Dick are taken to Lansing, Kansas to the death row section. They spend the next five years there living a mundane life of isolation from the other prison inmates, entirely of sitting in their cell with a weekly shower and only reading and writing material to keep themselves occupied outside their own thoughts. Bill Jensen narrates about the mundane life on death row before execution and that neither one of them would have ever done the crime alone, but together, they formed a third personality, which is the one that did it. Perry spends most of his time painting portraits and Dick doing research about his rights to not be executed. Three times their case went to the Supreme Court and all three of their appeals were rejected.After a little over five years of waiting, Perry and Dick are executed by hanging on just after midnight on April 14, 1965 at the gallows nearby. Dick is the first one and makes a final testimony that he has no hard feelings and is being taken to a better place. During Dick's execution, Perry and Reverend James Post, whom he talked to on the phone at the bus terminal, is present. Perry tells the chaplain about the story of he and his father in Alaska prospecting and building a lodge, but it was a complete failure and not a single client ever came and over time when food was running low, Perry's father got cross and blamed him for being greedy when he was eating a biscuit. They got in a fight and he pulled a gun on Perry saying ""I'm the last living thing you're ever going to see"", from the vision he had before killing the Clutter's. Perry declares he hates his father, but loves him as well.Dick has now died from hanging and his dead body is cut down. Bill Jensen declares to a young reporter that the executions are not solving anything except three families broken up and more speeches from politicians and everyone passing the buck over who is to blame for this crime; the criminals or society for rejecting them. Perry is brought over in a police car to be hanged. Right after being brought up to the gallows and before hanging, he envisions the leathery and impersonal hangman looking like his father. The trap door opens and Perry is hanged."
Hombre,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061770/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"John Russell, disdained by his ""respectable"" fellow stagecoach passengers because he was raised by Native Americans, becomes their only hope for survival when they are set upon by outlaws. John 'Hombre' Russell is a white man raised by the Apaches on an Indian reservation and later by a white man in town. As an adult he prefers to live on the reservation. He is informed that he has inherited a lodging-house in the town. He goes to the town and decides to trade the place for a herd. He has to go to another city. The only stagecoach is one being hired for a special trip paid by Favor and his wife Audra. As there are several seats, others join the stagecoach making seven very different passengers in all. During the journey they are robbed. With the leadership of John Russell they escape with little water and the money that the bandits want. They are pursued by the bandits. As they try to evade the bandits they reveal their true nature in a life threatening situation.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Bill G. Walsall England Pale-skinned, blue-eyed, but reared by the fearsome Apache Indians, taciturn John Russell is a white man who has embraced the ways of his fellow Apaches. When his father dies--leaving him a boarding house--John finds himself in a dusty stagecoach along with a mismatched septet of passengers, including his Mexican-American friend, Mendez; landlady, Jessie, and the brutal Cicero Grimes, after deciding to sell the property. Before long, the travellers will show their true colours, unbeknownst to them, however, that ruthless bandits have set their sights on robbing them. Now, the only person who stands between the murderous cut-throats and the helpless commuters is John; a man of few words who knows how to handle his deadly rifle. Is Hombre their only chance of survival?—Nick Riganas It's the late nineteenth century in the Arizona Territory. John Russell was kidnapped by the Apaches when he was a child, they who raised him as Apache. Even after his biological father found him later in life and brought him home, Russell decided to return to life up in the mountains with the Apaches partly in having faced discrimination by the white community for now being a ""savage"". Russell learns that his biological father has just passed and has bequeathed to him his property in Sweet Mary, which has been used as a boarding house run by Jessie Brown. Not turning his back on his biological father this time, Russell decides to sell the house instead of taking Jessie up on her offer to continue it as boarding house, he needn't have even been there or lifted a hand while money went into his pocket. Shortly thereafter, Reverend Alex Favor, the aging Indian agent, and his proper younger wife Audra Favor are anxious to leave town, and with the stagecoach line having just shut down with the onset of the railroad, they, with Audra leading the transaction, decide to buy whatever required from the stagecoach company, including the rig - the only one available, a mud wagon - and the horses, to protect the company if the Favors decided to sue in the case of any issue, and hire the ethnic Mexican stagecoach manager Henry Mendez to be their driver. They, in turn, offer the other spots on the wagon to anyone wanting a ride. The other passengers are: Russell who is heading back to the Apaches; Jessie, who has no reason to stay after her male companion, Sheriff Frank Braden, refuses to marry her, he regarding his refusal as a favor to her; young married couple Billy Lee and Doris Blake, he who no longer has a job as he worked for the stagecoach company and she who hated life there anyway; and stranger Cicero Grimes, who seems as eager to be on that specific wagon as the Favors were to get out of town. Early on in their trip, the Reverend learns of Russell's Apache background, and using Mendez as his intermediary, quietly banishes Russell from the inside of the wagon, Russell instead to travel the rest of the way on top with Mendez. Things take a further turn when they discover the reason Grimes wanted so desperately to be on that specific wagon, his reason which threatens the lives of everyone else on board. Russell seems to have the best handle on what to do to get them out of this predicament, with the primary question being what the Favors will do with their specific goals and their view of Russell. Caught somewhat in the middle is Jessie, who cannot witness human suffering no matter what wrong said persons may have done up to this point in life.—Huggo John ""Hombre"" Russell (Paul Newman) patiently waits for a black stallion to lead its herd to a waterhole so he can trap the herd. He and his San Carlos Apache tribesmen will sell the horses to a local stagecoach line. Henry Mendez (Martin Balsam) tells John the stagecoach line is shutting down because of the railroad and urges John to return to his White Man's roots and take over a boarding house left to John by his deceased stepfather.John inspects the boarding house and tells the landlady, Jessie (Diane Cilento), that he intends to sell the place and head to Bisbee, Arizona. Alex Favor (Fredric March) and his wife, Audra (Barbara Rush) shows up in town and charters one last stagecoach to Bisbee.

John is asked to ride on top with Henry when Alex finds out John is a White Man raised as an Apache.Bandits hold up the stagecoach and Cicero is their leader. They take Audra and thousands of dollars from Alex, who embezzled the money from the San Carlos Apache tribe. As the bandits leave, John kills two of them and recovers the saddlebag of cash. John and the passengers head back to town through the mountains. They stop at an abandoned mining site and rest in a shack on a hill.The bandits show up at the mine and Cicero offers to trade Audra for the cash. John shoots Cicero during the negotiation. A bandit ties up Audra, leaving her in the hot sun to die. Audra begs for help and the passengers want to trade the money, but no one is brave enough to go down the hill, except for Jessie. John stops Jessie, gives the cash to a passenger with instructions to return it to the San Carlos Apache tribe. John heads downhill with the saddlebags. John cuts Audra loose. She heads up the hill, blocking a clear shot of the bandit from the shack. The wounded Cicero confronts John and discovers the saddlebag is empty.

Point Blank,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062138/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After being double-crossed and left for dead, a mysterious man named Walker single-mindedly tries to retrieve the money that was stolen from him. Mal Reese is in a real bind--owing a good deal of money to his organized crime bosses--and gets his friend Walker to join him in a heist. It goes off without a hitch, but when Reese realizes the take isn't as large as he had hoped, he kills Walker--or so he thinks. Some time later, Walker decides it's time to get his share of the money and starts with his ex-wife Lynne, who took up with Reese after the shooting. That leads him on a trail--to his wife's sister Chris, to Reese himself, then onto Big Stegman, then Frederick Carter, then up the line of gangsters in an effort to get money from people who simply won't acknowledge that they owe him anything.—garykmcd Walker, an lone gangster who used to be partners with Mal Reese, is shot and left for dead at Alcatraz. Knowing that he has been betrayed by his own partner in crime, Walker is determined to even the score and get revenge by taking the $93,000 that was taken. He enlists help from Chris, a woman who knows Mal, and continues his personal vendetta through the city of Los Angeles, using violence as a tool of intimidation for the bad guys.—blazesnakes9 Based on the theme of the individual pitted against the large, impersonal organization. Here the central character is an old-fashioned loner of a gunman embroiled with a large-scale, corporate criminal operation behind a respectable-looking 'front'. Without delving into psychology or motivation, the film places emphasis on action and surface appearances, superbly capturing the glossy, depersonalized feel of a 1967 Los Angeles--a nightmare landscape of concrete, glass and coiling freeways.—alfiehitchie Lee Marvin plays Walker, a man who loses his share of $93,000 when he's double-crossed on a heist. His old pal Mal Reese (John Vernon) filled him with bullet holes and left him to rot, presuming he was dead or would die soon anyway. Reese needed all the money to pay back his debts to the Organization. Walker's wife also came along for the ride, but she didn't know what was going to happen. The job took place at the dark and dreary old prison, Alcatraz, where money pick-ups are made. After being shot up, Walker apparently made it out alive. During this sequence, and throughout the film, there are flashbacks to provide the backstory. They help convey Walker's thoughts and feelings, even if it seems like he doesn't have them anymore. He is portrayed as austere, terse, and slightly aloof.Now all Walker wants to do is get his money back. At the inception of this storyline we see Walker stomping down a corridor, his footsteps loud, repetitive, pounding. Walker is fiercely determined, a man on a mission. Walker does a lot of walking throughout the movie, going from one place to another until he finds justice. That's the only thing on his mind. Shots of his wife getting out of bed, going out, and coming back home play while the pounding of his footsteps overshadow it. Since his wife is the person closest to him, and because she had an affair with Reese, Walker goes straight for her first. As the sound of footsteps come to a halt, we see Walker uninhibitedly barge in his wife's front door with a gun in hand, knock her down, and head right for the bedroom-blasting away several rounds at the bed. Reese wasn't there as he'd hoped. Now it's up to Walker to hunt down Reese through his connections. Reese is a top man in the syndicate this time around, so getting to him is not easy. Walker enlists the help of his wife's sister (Angie Dickinson). Since Reese wouldn't give him the cash, Walker disposes of him and move to the next guy in line. The bill gets passed down. Walker simply holds the whole Organization accountable. He won't relent until his gets the money.It all comes down to Walker going back to the place that haunts his memory: Alcatraz. That's where his money will be dropped. Once again, an act of treachery is in the works. Walker is set up to be hit by a sniper. He observes the drop-off point from overhead, waits it out, and makes the men believe he didn't show up. At the last moment, all you see is Walker dissipate into the darkness like a ghost. The ending doesn't fill in the blanks. Will he retrieve the money? Has this all been a dream from the beginning when he was left to die? The answers are left up to the viewer."

Counterpoint,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062829/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A famous orchestra conductor is captured by the Germans in WW2, and is forced to perform at private concerts for the Nazi generals. During a December 1944 German offensive in Belgium, a USO symphonic orchestra entertaining the front-line American troops is captured by the Germans. Initially, the Germans want to execute them, in accordance with orders received from Berlin. However, the orchestra leader, world-famous conductor Lionel Evans, persuades the Germans to spare their lives, arguing that his orchestra members are just civilian non combatants. Taken to the HQ of a German tank division, Lionel Evans and his orchestra members meet the German commanding officer, General Schiller, an avid music lover. General Schiller has respect for the musicians and he's hesitating about the standing order of executing all prisoners. However, the general's second-in-command, Colonel Arndt, is a blood-thirsty, by-the-book, type of fanatical officer who wants the prisoners shot. The general requests that Evans and his orchestra perform one more time, for him personally. Evans, out of pride and patriotism, refuses. But some members of his orchestra feel that performing for the General would keep them alive. A battle of wills between the General and conductor Evans ensues. The prisoners are kept in a castle's chapel, near the division's HQ. In the following days, the prisoners are fed and are allowed to practice their music in the chapel. When an orchestra member panics and tries to run, the German guards kill him. This prompts Evans to agree to perform one last concert for the German general and his officers. In the meantime, 2 American soldiers who had hid among the musicians before their capture, continue to pretend to be musicians, despite suspicions from the part of Colonel Arndt. Evans secretly agrees to allow the 2 soldiers to escape and seek help from the nearest Allied troops. During the escape attempt, one soldier is caught and shot. The other, is found dead in a field by the Belgian resistance. As the day of the concert approaches, one Belgian resistance member, posing as a local peasant, contacts Evans to tell him that an upcoming resistance attack will try to free the orchestra. The resistance attack would coincide with the concert for the Germans. General Schiller's tank division receives fuel and orders to join the offensive. Schiller orders his division out, while he remains behind for the concert. However, Colonel Arndt and a few men also remain behind to dig a mass grave in the castle's courtyard and to prepare the execution, after the concert. Tension builds up as the orchestra members, dressed in their official concert attire, file past the mass grave, to the chapel where the concert is to be performed. Conductor Evans wonders whether General Schiller will really have them executed or freed. Evans also wonders if the Belgian resistance attack will come in time to save them.—nufs68 December 1944. With the war looking like it is near its end, the USO has resumed entertainment services on the European mainland. One such USO performer is an American symphony orchestra under the direction of famed Lionel Evans who, on their tour, are currently in recently liberated Belgium. They are caught in an ambush under a German counteroffensive and taken into custody to a castle commandeered by the Nazis, that unit under the direction of General Schiller. The primary standoff in this situation is Schiller's want for the orchestra to perform in a concert for him with Evans conducting, which Evans refuses to do. The command structure between the German military and the orchestra has many parallels including dissension among the ranks under their dictatorial leader. Many of the orchestra members want Evans to do what Schiller asks in believing it their best chance of survival, while Evans believes they will be killed regardless and does not want to provide Schiller the satisfaction. Who may be able to influence stubborn Evans is cellist Annabelle Rice, the wife of the concertmaster Victor Rice, she who is Evans' former girlfriend, there still being feelings between the two. On the other side, Schiller's second in command, Colonel Arndt, views the orchestra members as any other prisoners that are to be executed immediately. What influences the decisions on the orchestra's side is the fact that two US Army infantrymen have been able to hide among the orchestra in the melee, some orchestra members who see them as threats to their safety as they being caught means almost certain death for them all, versus others who believe the two are their best chance to escape in getting word to the Allied forces of their captivity.—Huggo"

Lisa has have been freed and technicians have had time to mount the new element into bombs. These bombs are loaded onto waiting fighter aircraft and the force takes off and moves in for the attack.Despite heavy losses the Air Force fighters press home the attack; eventually enough of the new element is dropped on the creature to cause a reaction. The monster is shrinking and finally becomes no larger than the spore they originally found.Once neutralized it is decided the creature cant be destroyed on Earth and the final scene of the movie shows our intrepid crew flying into space to dump the alien spores in orbit around the sunChapman_glen@yahoo.com"

The Night of the Generals,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062038/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1942, a Polish prostitute and German Agent is murdered in Warsaw. Suspicion falls on three Generals, and Major Grau of German Intelligence seeks justice which ends up taking decades. In 1942 Warsaw, a Polish prostitute is murdered in a sadistic way. Major Grau (Omar Sharif), an Agent from German Intelligence who believes in justice, is in charge of the investigation. An eyewitness saw a German General leaving the building after a scream of the victim. A further investigation shows that three Generals do not have any alibi for that night: General Tanz (Peter O'Toole), Major General Klaus Kahlenberge (Donald Pleasence), and General von Seidlitz-Gabler (Charles Gray). The three avoid direct contact with Major Grau and become potential suspects. As Major Grau gets close to them, he is promoted and sent to Paris. In 1944 Paris, this quartet is reunited, and Major Grau continues his investigation. Meanwhile, a plan for killing Adolf Hitler is plotted by his high command, a romance between Ulrike von Seidlitz-Gabler (Joanna Pettet) and Lance Corporal Kurt Hartmann (Sir Tom Courtenay) is happening and Inspector Morand (Philippe Noiret) is helping Major Grau in his investigation. The story ends in 1965, in Hamburg, with another, similar crime.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The murder of a prostitute and German Agent in Nazi occupied Warsaw draws Wehrmacht Major Grau (Omar Sharif) into an investigation where the evidence points to one of three high ranking Generals. The trail leads Grau from Warsaw to Paris and into conflict with the 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, of which two of the Generals are involved. Grau's case goes unresolved, and it is not until 1965 when the true killer is brought to justice.—Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> In 1942 German-occupied Poland a prostitute and German agent is murdered in her Warsaw apartment and Maj. Grau, German Army Intelligence, is called in to investigate the crime. The only clue is that the murderer wore German uniform pants with a red stripe and Grau realizes that the suspect is one of three high ranking German generals. General Kahlenberg is single and focused on his position. General Von Seidlitz-Gabler is married to a Nazi supporter and is a womanizer. General Tanz is a war hero from the Russian front who is close to Hitler and has been sent to Warsaw to deal with the resistance that is tying up German forces. Tanz and his tactics prove he is merciless and violent. Corporal Hartmann, a supposed hero from Russian action recovering from being wounded, gets assistance from a relative on Kahlenberg's staff to get an administrative job and not return to action. Hartmann begins a secret affair with Ulrike Vom Seidlitz-Gabler, the general's daughter. Before Grau can complete his investigation, one of the generals take steps to have Grau promoted to Colonel and posted to Paris.
Two years later, in Paris, all four officers come together again and eventually another prostitute is murdered. There are similarities in the crime to the one in 1942 and Maj. Grau again takes charge of the investigation. Two of the generals are involved in the plot to assassinate Hitler and they plot to have General Tanz, a favorite of Hitler, to spend a couple days on leave prior to the assassination attempt. Hartmann is assigned as his driver and Paris tour guide. Ulrike arrives by train to meet up with Hartmann but their reunion is hampered by Hartmann's assignment. Hartmann is used by Tanz to procure a prostitute and then incriminated as the killer and flees Paris. Grau puts the clues together and is about to apprehend the killer but in the confusion of the allied advance and failed assassination he is killed by Tanz when he attempts to arrest him.
The story shifts to 1965 where a reunion of the German military division is planned In Hamburg Germany. A third prostitute is murdered in similar circumstances. A Parisian detective, Morand, involved in the second investigation in 1944 with Grau, and now a member of Interpol, who investigates realizes that the murder is similar to the two previous murders years earlier. He revisits the surviving witnesses from Maj. Grau's original investigations, including Ulrike to trace Hartmann, and finally confronts the killer at the military reunion banquet where Grau's justice is achieved."
How I Won the War,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061789/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An inept British World War II commander leads his troops through a series of misadventures in North Africa and Europe. This movie features Beatle John Lennon and Roy Kinnear as ill-fated enlisted men under the inept command of Lieutenant Ernest Goodbody (Michael Crawford). The story unwinds mostly in flashbacks of Lieutenant Goodbody who has lower-class beginnings and education which make him a poor officer who commands one of the worst units of the Army.—Jenny Evans <J.Evans@uts.edu.au> It's the end of World War II. British Lieutenant Ernest Goodbody (Michael Crawford) is relating the story of how he won the war to a German officer. His ""victory"" is despite the unfeeling power mongering of one of his superiors, Colonel Grapple (Sir Michael Hordern). As he tells the story of the primary mission he led of his Musketeers, the mission to construct a cricket field behind enemy lines in North Africa, his troop members, some no longer in the living, tell both of their own preoccupations with other things in life preventing them from being the best of soldiers, and of Goodbody's ineptitude. Some lament the fact that they didn't kill Goodbody when they had the chance. The actual telling of the story is due to Goodbody's troop being caught in a precarious situation in the Rhine Valley, from which Goodbody commandeers his way out successfully. Are Goodbody's actions actually successful?—Huggo This film contains the memoirs of one Lt. Earnest Goodbody (Michael Crawford) of 3rd troop, 4th Musketeers--albeit presented to us via 2 perspectives.Early on in the film, the lieutenant is captured while attempting to cross the Rhine river and secure the last intact bridge for the Allies (having boarded an inflated raft by himself and been abandoned by his men). He intermittently recounts his story to a German officer (Karl Michael Vogler) while we, the viewing audience, are also treated to what really happened (seeing as he sugar-coats his version of the story).His earliest recollections are of his officer training under Lt. Colonel Grapple (Michael Hordern), who is shown to be as oblivious to the suffering of his charges as Goodbody proves to be. During the introduction of the story (and shortly thereafter), we meet the men under Goodbody's command:Transom--the unit's suffering second-in-command, who proves to be the only true, hard-working soldier in the group. He is reluctant to take charge of the situations they find themselves in but often does. He encourages the others to kill the Lieutenant and resists the temptation several times. Portrayed by Lee Montague.Dooley--the unit's third-in-command. While he and Transom start at the same rank in the beginning (Corporal), he seems more than willing to place most of the rank-induced responsibilities in the other man's hands. In fact, he acts more like a lackey to Transom than an equal. Portrayed by Ewan Hooper.Gripweed--the Lieutenant's batman (appointed personal assistant, as was common at the time in the British Army). He is a compulsive thief and admits to having been a former member of the British Fascist Party. He seems to show some naivete regarding the true nature of war and the incapabilities of his unit and often is found both chiding and being sycophantic towards Goodbody. Portrayed by then-Beatle John Lennon.Juniper--serves as both the unit's crusty old veteran and the would-be comic relief man. He appears more than willing to spur the rest of the group on to do things but is unwilling to do any real fighting. Throughout the film we see him appear in various comedic guises (such as a ventriloquist with a dummy and a clown). He is perceived by the others to be going insane and as the film progresses; he 'promotes' himself both in rank and as a master strategist (using medals taken from dead soldiers). Portrayed by Jack MacGowran.Clapper--the realist of the group. He is constantly harboring the belief that his wife is cheating on him back home (we find out, mere moments before his death, that she was merely making up stories based on the affairs a neighbor of theirs was having). While, like the rest of the unit, he has little respect for Goodbody, he goes to him for advice numerous times. He also endures the most criticism from Transom regarding his general appearance as a soldier (being told he's improperly dressed for merely having his shirt not buttoned right--although Juniper, standing next to him in the particular shot, is dressed as a clown). Portrayed by Roy Kinnear.Drogue--resigned to dying in North Africa (as he points out repeatedly), he is constantly willing off his possessions to other members of the unit. While he's one of the few to show some level of bravery in the film, he is also shown not to be too careful. Portrayed by James Cossins.Spool--the wireless radio operator for the unit (who never gets to do so). The only major fault that can be attributed to him is that he's probably the clumsiest member of the group (he immediately gets a splinter while holding a fake rifle during training and later sets Goodbody up for landing headfirst in a sand pit merely by knocking into him with a ladder). Portrayed by Ronald Lacey.The Melancholy Musketeer (real name not known, even to himself)--the resident coward of the group, who seems to be completely unaware of what he's fighting for, and why he signed up in the first place. He flees for cover in the middle of battle and at one point even abandons the group (only to be picked up later in the film having hidden in a German truck and claiming to have been captured). Portrayed by Jack Hedley.The unit's first assignment is to land behind enemy lines and set up an advance cricket pitch at an oasis. The purpose of the mission: to give Allied soldiers something to look forward to when they take that particular region. Any other unit would have felt disgraced to accept such a mission but Lt. Goodbody takes it with pride (fearing his men will die of boredom otherwise).The mission immediately is bungled when Goodbody accidentally orders signal rockets fired (giving away their position to a nearby German defense post). In the hustle to avoid being cratered, the unit loses half of their vehicles and Dooley is killed.In a twist of surrealism, each soldier that dies under the Lieutenant's command returns immediately after, replaced by a soldier painted to resemble a plastic army man. From Goodbody's perspective, that man is still alive. Footage shown during the death scenes of these characters is tinted a certain color for each incident (green, then pink, then red, then blue), and the dead soldier 'returns' in that color.With half of their vehicles gone and little fuel remaining, Goodbody decides to raid a German fuel dump on their way to the oasis. In spite of mounting excitement from some of the men (Transom and Goodbody, specifically, with Juniper doing a brief standup routine--during which the two others debate whether or not the man has lost his mind), the raid on the fuel dump ends predictably in failure, seeing as only 3 of the men are willing to advance on the outpost once it's realized that the Germans have heavy machine guns. Drogue is killed (foolishly walking out into the line of fire), and Goodbody is nearly killed in a one-on-one fight with an enemy soldier who is promptly killed by Transom with a bayonet. After the retreat, a light plane spots them and attacks. Goodbody ignores the hail of bullets flying around him to point out how to signal an oncoming plane (having mistaken the attacker for an Allied plane) and goes into a minor tantrum upon discovery that their roller full of water is missing. He spots a group of off-duty Italian soldiers playing soccer nearby (who, it should be pointed out, were on the Allies' side by this point) and immediately spouts racial slurs against them and accuses them of stealing their roller. While this is going on, Transom grabs a submachine gun and shoots down the plane--marking their 'first real victory' (as Goodbody puts it).In the ensuing explosion of the plane's wreckage, the Melancholy Musketeer panics and attempts to flee in one of their trucks. Juniper destroys it, leaving the Musketeer to flee with his pants on fire. The rest of the group carries on towards the oasis (eventually having to go on foot, with the dead versions of Drogue and Dooley carrying the water roller). The men stop near the edge of a cliff, only to find themselves in the middle of a minefield. Spool, going mad with dehydration and heat stress, runs to the roller for a drink and begins to throw a fit after the discovery that Gripweed had let the water out to make the roller easy to move. Goodbody ends up being the last one to find out about the mines (having started doing exercises near the edge of the cliff and discovered that the oasis is nearby). In the ensuing chaos, the film breaks the fourth wall and two ladies (played by the actresses who waved to the Beatles early in the film 'Help!') discuss a similar fit suffered by a son of one of the ladies (""He's not dead, they didn't get him. Missing. Turn up he will, missing he is..."").Colonel Grapple arrives moments later (using a jeep he had 'appropriated' from the unit earlier in the film) and gives them some water, and spurs them to carry on and take the oasis. In a lengthy 'death scene' (in which a man in plain clothes delivers a long-winded recount of a joke he gave to his men during the war), the men take the oasis seemingly without a real fight and while rounding up prisoners (the men whistling the theme to ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" all the while), a rifle lands butt-first on the ground, firing off a live round that strikes Spool in the head.While the men are setting up the cricket pitch (the ground is awfully uneven, forcing some of the men to use dynamite to blast open areas), the Melancholy Musketeer turns up having been hiding in an enemy truck at the oasis. Juniper berates him for cowardice, and in his 'rage,' he strikes the Musketeer, as well as Goodbody and Colonel Grapple. He is put on an immediate court martial (with the Musketeer as his appointed attorney) while the other men in the unit attempt to play cricket with the German captives looking on. Eventually, the General who gave them the assignment arrives with another high-ranking officer, who merely points out that the men are 'rotten bowlers.' Juniper hitches a ride with the officers as they leave (we last see him near the end of the film in a straightjacket with his stolen medals pinned on).During the intermissions of these scenes and the ones to come, Goodbody and Odlebog, the German officer, discuss their views on how the war should be fought and Odlebog is appalled to discover that Goodbody is a fascist at heart. The two men seem to have plenty in common (Odlebog seems to be somewhat negligent of his men, as well) in spite of their current circumstances.The flashbacks then take us to the Allied advance towards the Rhine river. Goodbody's men are among those tasked with making a foothold along the river. Goodbody accidentally shoots the Melancholy Musketeer in the foot, cutting his unit short by yet another man. While passing through a village, Gripweed steals a milk bottle while laughing hysterically, accidentally giving their position away to the nearby German forces. The remaining troops hole up in and around a German farmhouse but are forced to retreat as a tank approaches with infantry as support. Clapper is cornered by two enemy soldiers and stabbed with a bayonet (a bit of irony seeing as how Clapper had not taken a demonstration of bayonet use seriously earlier in the film). Gripweed discovers another British soldier holed up in a shelled out barn, looting a corpse. Gripweed derides the man and dismisses him as an amateur thief, but unfortunately is forced to run when German mortars start raining on the barn. As he crosses an open field, a mortar lands right in front of him, perforating him with shrapnel. He solemnly looks at the camera and says ""I knew this would happen. You knew it would happen, didn't you?""As Goodbody and Transom retreat, a German flamethrower operator nearly corners them. They kill the man and Transom flees as the enemy tank approaches. Goodbody yells for him to come back to their cover, and Transom is mowed down by a tank-mounted machine gun in the confusion (spouting regrets of not having killed the Lieutenant earlier in his last breaths).As we return to the present, Odlebog realizes that in spite of his orders to destroy the bridge, he feels it would be much better if he let Goodbody 'have' it as it would end the war and bring his retirement sooner. In what appears to be a slant against capitalism, the two negotiate a price and Goodbody writes him a check for it. Meanwhile, Grapple leads the push to the bridge in a tank and is the first to cross. He runs over Odlebog in the process, leaving Goodbody with a small piece of the cold, hard reality of war that he had missed all those times before (he then shows relief at not having to deal with a bad check as though he hadn't just lost a friend). He then addresses his 'men' (who are now merely just the replacmenets of the dead soldiers from before) with optimism over the inevitable end of World War II.The film ends with a post-war 'reunion' orchestrated by Goodbody, with the Melancholy Musketeer obviously being the only one who shows up. The Musketeer says there was a good reason for fighting, but Goodbody points out that HE had won the war."

She tells him that they are the slaves of Kari and cannot escape because devil guardians protect the land. Every full moon, one of them is sacrificed as a bride to the guardians and never seen again. There are no men to help them. Kari enters the cell and orders Saria to be taken out.That evening, the blonde slave women perform a song and dance ritual for Kari while David is brought out and sat next to Kari. As Kari gives David some food one of the slaves rebels, shouts at Kari and throws some food at her, complaining about them having to be Kari's slaves providing her with food. A brief fight between them ends when the slave is skewered by Kari on a roasting spit. Kari returns to her seat and orders the singing and dancing to continue. Afterwards, David is brought to Kari's chamber. She tries to seduce him, but he resists because of her earlier cruelty. She offers him equality but he refuses, so she orders him to be taken away as her slave.Through a hole in his cell wall, David observes Kari worshiping at the statue of the white rhino and a masked face in the bushes.Saria is thrown back into the cell with her fellow slaves who tell her Kari has taken David as her own, but she refuses to believe them.The next day, in an effort to soften his resistance to her, Kari has David thrown into a cave cell, where there are several men in forced labor.Meanwhile, the blonde slaves all bow down before the statue of the white rhino and the masked face in the bushes before the ceremony of selection begins. Amyak (Stephanie Randall) is chosen to be the bride.While they eat in the cave, an old man explains to David that they had come to this land and hunted the white rhino to extinction, then erected a statue of the animal. They made the dark-haired people their slaves, but Kari escaped and returned with the devils who overthrew them and made the men the slaves. The man explains that Kari's evil came from the men capturing her in the first place and they have to remain in captivity until the real white rhino reappears and the false idol is destroyed.As Amyak is prepared for her bridal ceremony by the other slaves, Saria tries to convince them that David is their savior, if he can be released and exert his influence on Kari. Amyak is taken to the white rhino statue and sat on its back. The slaves and guards all leave, then Kari hands Amyak over to the figure with the mask in the bushes. The figure emerges to take Amyak away.That night, Saria sneaks into the cell where the men are held and convinces David to help them overthrow Kari and their captors. They kiss and he tells her that he will never leave her, but she says it is foretold that after a stranger has helped free them, he will return to his own land.David is brought to Kari and he convinces her that he will do everything she asks. In front of Saria and the others, she dances for him and then orders him to her chamber, but Saria cracks and reveals David is only doing it for her, not for Kari. Outraged, Kari orders David to be taken back to his cell.Saria is prepared for the bridal ceremony to be handed over to the devil guardians. Meanwhile, the other men help David to escape from his chains. As the slaves and guards return from leaving Kari and Saria at the statue of the white rhino, the men attack and overpower the guards. David runs to the statue and attacks the figure emerging from the bushes to take Saria. In the fight, he pulls the mask off, revealing that it is a tribal man. A fight also breaks out between Saria and Kari. A number of other masked figures emerge from the bushes, but at the same time, the freed men appear. The men chase the masked figures through the bushes, where several struggles and fights occur. Then, a real white rhino appears. Kari kneels before it, believing it to be a god, but it attacks and kills her. The struggling rivals disperse in fear.Saria and David return to the statue of the white rhino. She tells him he must return to his own land according to the legend, but that she will love him forever. David touches the horn of the statue, there is a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder and he is back in the cave again with the natives about to put him to death. Before they can do anything, the white rhino statue falls apart. Their leader says they are now free, thanks to David, and the temple of the false idol must be destroyed. They set fire to everything in the cave and leave to celebrate outside.One of David's assistants appears from the bushes and tells him he was only in the cave for a moment. They leave to return to their camp.Back at the camp, David finds a pendant from the prehistoric time in his pocket. As he leaves his tent, he is introduced to some new arrivals to the camp, one of whom is a woman named Sarah looks exactly like Saria."
The Trip,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062395/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A disillusioned TV commercial director is guided by his friend through an LSD trip, during which he evaluates his identity and his relationships with women. Paul Groves (Peter Fonda), a television commercial director, is in the midst of a personality crisis. His wife Sally (Susan Strasberg) has left him for another man and he seeks the help of his friend John (Bruce Dern), a self-styled guru and advocate of LSD. Paul asks John to be the guide on his first ""trip"". John takes Paul to a ""freak-out"" at his friend Max's (Dennis Hopper) pad. Splitting the scene, they score some acid from Max and return to John's split-level pad with an indoor/outdoor pool. Paul experiences visions of sex, death, strobe lights, flowers, dancing girls, witches, hooded riders, a torture chamber, and a dwarf. Most prominent among his hallucinations, however, are two women: Sally, his memories of which, both good and bad, he cannot so easily let go of, and Glenn (Salli Sachse), an acquaintance of Max's whom he has only just met but feels an immediate connection with, as she admires those who dare to try LSD and wishes to see him again soon. He panics, but John tells him to ""go with it, man."" Would you trust John?—alfiehitchie An idyllic seafront. A man in a tuxedo (Michael Nader) and a woman in a shimmering silver dress (Judy Lang) are locked in a passionate kiss. The woman coyly turns to us and declares ""Anything Is Possible... when you use April In Paris perfume"".This is revealed to be part of a TV commercial being directed by Paul Groves (Peter Fonda), whose personal life bares little resemblance to the fantasy he has been crafting: as his crew prepares for the next setup, Paul is visited by his soon-to-be-ex-wife Sally (Susan Strasberg), who chastises him for failing to notify her of his commitment to the shoot, as she has been waiting for him to sign divorce papers with their lawyer. Although they are still affectionate to each other, it is implied that Paul's workaholism has contributed to the rift between them.After the shoot, Paul and his friend John (Bruce Dern) travel to the communal mansion of another acquaintance, Max (Dennis Hopper), a self-styled guru who is hosting a marijuana-fueled ""freakout"". As John and Max make preparations, Paul strikes up a conversation with one of the guests, Glenn (Salli Sachse). He reveals that he intends to embark on a ""trip"" by taking LSD to gain personal insight. A mutual attraction between the pair quickly blossoms - Glenn finds people who try acid ""groovy"" - and they express a desire to see each other again. Paul and John go to the latter's house, where he lays out his procedure: Paul will take a single pill of acid (250 micrograms), that he is to ""turn off his mind, relax, and then float downstream"", and that he must have absolute faith and confidence in John, who promises to not leave him unattended. If Paul's trip turns bad, he will have the option of taking a pill of Thorazine, which will end the trip immediately. The drug - which Paul takes with a glass of apple juice - takes effect earlier than anticipated: his mind unexpectedly flashes back to his encounter with Glenn.On John's advice, Paul begins the trip proper by lying down and wearing an eye mask. In his mind's eye, he witnesses a parade of colors, accented by the beating of his heart, before imagining himself climbing a cliff amid the beaches of Big Sur, where he and Glenn watch as a pair of black-hooded figures ride on horseback. Returning to reality, Paul describes to John the flow of energy that he feels from everything surrounding him; he is especially fascinated by an orange, which to him radiates like the Sun. In his mind, Paul and Glenn are joined by Sally; he has sex with both women (alternately... or perhaps they have merged into one?) as they are bathed in a kaleidoscopic array of clashing, darkened colors. Paul tells John that he loves ""her"" (a possible reference to Sally, Glenn, or both, or even women in general), but that he fears that he will suffer if he does not know what love truly means. He then states that if one opens themself to sex and love, the process is easy.Paul and John take a walk outside (where Paul compares some nearby TV antenna towers to ""crosses on the mount""). In his trip, Paul encounters Glenn, a dwarf (Angelo Rossitto) peddling a witch's brew, and the hooded riders, who chase him into a cave leading to the mansion of Roderick Usher (as seen inHouse of Usher (1960)). At the same time as he traverses through the house, he runs across a field of sand dunes. In a secluded room of the mansion, he finds himself hanging from a noose; meanwhile, the Paul running through the dunes collapses in a Christ-like pose. Paul then undergoes a multitude of funeral processions - some more violent than others - and Sally mourns his passing. In reality, Paul (now swimming in John's pool) fears that he is about to die, and begs for the Thorazine; John pulls him out of the pool and towels him off. He calms Paul down and assures him that his fear of dying is ""all in [his] mind"", and advises him to ""just go along with it"" if he dies within the trip again. As John briefly leaves him alone to get him his clothes, Paul stares into a mirror and watches as an array of light and shadow sprout out of his and Sally's mouths; he tells John that he can see into his brain, and that he agrees with what he said about it being all in his mind.Returning to his hallucinations, Paul is led by the hooded riders to Sally and Glenn, where he walks with them through a forest and (in the nude) through a field of flowers. However, the scene suddenly turns to a vision (or perhaps a memory?) of Sally having sex with another man (Michael Blodgett). The scene transforms unexpectedly again: within a fun-house-like setting, Paul is strapped to a chair beside a carousel being ridden by another dwarf (Roger Arroyo), while Max is dressed like a judge and behaves as such. Paul's disjointed conversation with Max eventually turns to his profession as a commercial director, and the inherent inauthenticity of commercials themselves. Paul insists that it is a way of making a living, and that he is ""not guilty"". Max then turns to the topic of Sally: he makes Paul admit that he failed her as a lover, resulting in her having an affair. As they ride on the carousel together, Max encourages Paul to admit to his guilt, telling him that the pain he feels due to the fallout with Sally is a natural part of being one with the universe, but that he should not wallow in his suffering.Outside the house, night has fallen. Paul picks up a shell on John's desk and drops it into the pool, claiming that he has ""saved"" the universe. His hallucinations become more intense and erratic; he feels that he is dying again, but John encourages him to touch his hand, and reaffirms that he is his friend. John leaves the room briefly to get some more apple juice for Paul; alone, Paul checks out a nearby closet, but feels claustrophobic inside it. Upon coming out, he sees what appears to be John, slumped over dead with a bloody gash on his head. This prompts Paul to flee the house... just as the real John returns with the juice.Running through the neighborhood, Paul sees the glare of a car's headlights as a group of assailants beating him with shovels. Finding himself in a suburban home, he turns on the living room TV to coverage of the ongoing Vietnam War. He then encounters one of the home's occupants, a little girl named Alexandra (Caren Bernsen), who he helps get a glass of milk. Alexandra's awakening father (Tom Signorelli) mistakes Paul for an intruder, prompting him to again take flight.Paul finds himself on Sunset Strip, where he is dazzled by the blinding neon lights and marquees. He then goes to a laundromat, where a lonely and sarcastic woman, Flo (Barboura Morris), is eating fried chicken. At first amused by Paul's strange mannerisms and the attention he gives her, Flo becomes enraged when he pulls her laundry out of a dryer (as he believes Sally to be trapped inside), and rushes to call the police. Paul seeks refuge in Bead Game, a go-go club run by John's friend Cash (Dick Miller). Recognizing that Paul is stoned, a waitress (Luana Anders) ominously warns him that people sometimes unintentionally kill themselves while tripping out. Enraptured by the sights and sounds of the club - particularly a duo of painted topless dancers (Frankie SmithandSusan Walters) and a band playing an improvisational rock tune - Paul's attention is broken when he notices Glenn. As he mills through the crowd to reach her, he spots two police officers, and flees from them through the back entrance as Glenn leaves the club.As his mind is bombarded with images of a massive love-in, Paul rushes to Max's mansion. Max assures Paul that John is alive, and that he has been looking for him. Paul confides to Max that he is afraid; Max's girlfriend, Lulu (Katherine Walsh), confirms Paul's feelings while sharing a brief, intimate moment with him. Describing the events that have transpired since John's ""death"" (and, in Max's words, separating ""the facts from the trip""), Paul believes that the police are after him as a result of his encounters with Alexandra and Flo. Concerned that Paul might unintentionally lead the police to the mansion and bust him for the large quantities of drugs in his possession, Max advises Paul to go to a restaurant on the Strip, where John will pick him up. At the restaurant, Paul finds Glenn, who is elated to see him again. Paul tells her of his concerns about being caught by the police, but Glenn tells him that she ""[doesn't] believe in police"". Paul, feeling the effects of the LSD wearing off, fears that he is about to ""lose something"" (Sally); Glenn advises him to let his feelings go. She drives Paul to her beach-side house, during which he flashes back to earlier moments of his trip and the day (especially his meeting with Sally), and imagines himself being chased by the hooded riders onto Big Sur. Paul spends the final moments of his trip passionately making love with Glenn. The hallucinations and flashbacks intensify until Paul is corned by the riders, who finally unmask themselves to reveal Glenn and Sally.His trip finally over, Paul lets Glenn sleep as he walks onto her porch, and watches as the sun rises over the beach. Unexpectedly, his life now bares something of a resemblance to the farcical April In Paris commercial he had been making the day before. We then hear a conversation he has with Glenn once she awakens: she asks Paul if he found the insight he was looking for; he tells her that he thinks he loves her, ""and everybody else"". Her tone turning more ambiguous, she tells him, ""It's easy now. Wait 'till tomorrow""; in response, Paul says ""Yeah, well... I'll think about that tomorrow"".[The original theatrical prints end with Paul's image shattering like glass, as if to imply that his trip has permanently fractured his state of mind. In the Director's Cut, there is no such effect, leaving the audience to decide for themselves how Paul's trip has impacted him, and what he will do with his renewed capacity for love.]"

Enter Laughing,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061626/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young would-be actor seeks his first break. David Kolowitz, a nice young man living with his parents in New York City in 1938, works at a machine repair shop. His parents want David to study to become a pharmacist. But what he really wants is to be an actor like his idol, Ronald Colman. One day, at his friend Marvin's suggestion, David tries out for a part in a play, and gets it, despite his obvious lack of acting experience (not to mention ability). True, it's a rather small part in a low-rent production. Leading the troupe is a washed-up, alcoholic actor who hires David at the urging of his actress-daughter, who finds David ""cute."" To play his part, David must come up with his own costume - a tuxedo - and pay the house five dollars a week, ostensibly for tuition. But it is David's first acting job, one which calls for him to ""enter laughing."" And if it doesn't work out - well, there's always pharmacy school.—Eugene Kim <genekim@concentric.net> New York City, 1938. David Kolowitz, who still lives at home with his parents - overbearing mother Emma and milquetoast father Morris - has his whole life planned by them: that beyond his current job working in Mr. Foreman's machine shop, he will eventually, preferably sooner than later, go to pharmacy school whenever they can afford to send him. David has other things on his mind, one being girls. Despite being in a relationship with Wanda, the two who probably love each other, his mind and eyes often wander to other girls, like Miss B, the bookkeeper of one of Mr. Foreman's regular business customers, Harry Hamburger. The second is movies, especially those ofRonald Colman. As he is always mimicking Colman in reciting lines from his movies, David dreams of becoming a movie actor despite having no experience. Regardless, on his friend Marvin's suggestion, David decides to go to an open casting call, not for a movie role but for a way off Broadway position within Harrison B. Marlowe's theater troupe. Unwise to the entertainment and acting businesses, David does get the position, which includes a small but pivotal supporting role in the current production, but, excited into this foray into acting, doesn't comprehend the reason for the small interest is that it, unpaid, requires the successful applicant to make financial investments of his own, specifically for ""tuition"" (as the position is seen as a learning one within the company) and for his costume of a tuxedo, money for which he doesn't have. The other catch is that David goes on stage in two days, meaning that he not only has to learn his lines by then, but fit in much needed rehearsals, all within his other time commitments especially in his day job with an already exasperated Mr. Foreman. David also has to convince his parents, who he knows would be against him doing anything outside of their set goals for him, and Wanda, who is probably okay with this acting job as a side to his life, but perhaps not okay in he being passionate with his leading lady, Marlowe's daughter Angela who has to feel what she is performing.—Huggo"

Tobruk,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062377/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Canadian POW major is rescued by a special British military unit made up of Germans to help lead an attack on a major Nazi fuel depot in Tobruk, Libya. September 1942 - With Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps on the march through Egypt, a British special forces unit, composed of German Jews who serve with the British despite the mutual resentment between both, kidnap a Canadian officer who is an expert topographer and who is held prisoner by the Vichy French in Algeria. The officer, Donald Craig, must negotiate a company of British and German-Jewish commandos through 800 miles of the Sahara to aide a pending amphibious landing against Tobruk's massive fuel storage base - a mission that sees one impediment after another, and which discovers an undetected German armored force ready to win the battle of Egypt.—Michael Daly <fanstp43@aol.com> British commandos, German Jews and an American demolition's expert must contend with the desert, German patrols and a traitor while on a mission to blow up Rommel's fuel supplies in preparation of an amphibious landing on the North African coast.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> September 1942, northern Africa. The German Afrika Korps is some ninety miles from the Suez Canal, and the British have been bombing Marshall Erwin Rommel's supply lines and his supply bases in Tobruk in Libya to little effect. But hundreds of miles east in an Algerian port, Vichy French are holding varied soldiers of the warring nations as prisoner aboard a ship - among the soldiers so imprisoned is Canadian Army Major Donald Craig, an expert in the topography of the Egyptian theater who'd been captured by the French after escaping the Germans across the Sahara.The ship is boarded by German-speaking commandos, who shoot several guards, set fire to the ship, and open the holding cell to take Craig. Craig tries to escape but is knocked unconscious and taken by motorboat to a seaplane. When interrogated by Captain Bergman, the commando leader, Craig grabs a gun and tries to hijack the plane, but is shocked when it is being escorted by a Royal Air Force fighter, a lend-lease P-40 Warhawk of Number 112 Squadron. Captain Bergman then identifies his unit as the Special Identification Group - German-born Jews serving under the British.The seaplane lands in Kufra, a desert strip 800 miles southwest of Tobruk, and Craig and Bergman are greeted by Lieutenant Boydon, assistant to Colonel Harker, commander of the Long Range Desert Group, a commando unit. Harker explains to Craig that Staff in Cairo has decided to adopt a plan first submitted by Craig to infiltrate commandos to blow up Rommel's fuel base in Tobruk; Craig's original plan was submitted when German forces were weaker than they are now, but Harker and his men are tasked with driving through the 800-mile section of the Sahara - in a mere eight days - disguised as POWs under guard of Bergman's SIG masquerading as regular Nazi soldiers. Craig's responsibility is to guide the commando unit through territory only Craig is familiar with; once in Tobruk the commandos are to reach Tobruk harbor where they are to destroy antiship batteries at a cove guarding the harbor and guide a landing of soldiers from sea to blow up the German fuel base and then evacuate to ships. Craig is immediately skeptical of the plan, but has no alternative but to participate.Craig then gets his first encounter with the antisemitic attitude of Harker when the colonel remarks to be on guard around the Jews as they can't be trusted, citing his six years experience in Palestine as evidence. Bergman and his men for their part aren't any more trusting of the British army; in a private conversation Bergman and three of his most trusted men, Lt. Max Mohnfeld, Sgt. Krug, and Corporal Bruckner (whom Bergman has known for ten years), agree they will be thrown to the wolves as the Italians have been similarly sacrificed by their German ""allies.""The column of half-tracks and lorries starts on its 800-mile trek; after a full day the unit stops to rest in a valley, but several miles away a column of Italian tanks is spotted and inconveniently sets up camp nearly a mile away. Later that night a German unit appears from the other side. Bergman and two commandos sneak into the Italian camp and silently kill two sentries, then flee to their side as Harker sets up mortars and opens fire on both the German and Italian units, thus tricking them into opening fire on each other.The next day Craig diverts the column away from nearby flats and instead cuts through an area known to be a German minefield, to the surprise and anger of Harker. At the precipice of the minefield Craig spots two mines and painstakingly clears sand away to make them visible; he then orders Bergman to fire on both. The result is detonation of two lines of mines and thus opening of a safe passage.A night later he strikes up conversation with Bergman as the Captain is adjusting the engine of a half-track. The conversation segues into a bitter comment by Bergman about Nazi slave-labor and Craig somewhat defensively notes ""We all know what's going on in Europe."" Bergman for his part notes that, as a Jew, his war won't be done when the present one eventually is - he and his people will eventually return to Israel.Days later the commando column is attacked by a P40 from Number 112 Squadron, the pilot unaware who the column actually belongs to. The column is forced to fight back and the P40 is shot down, but eight men are killed and a lorry with the column's extra fuel is blasted. The commandos are forced to bury the dead and bury the burning lorry, and the ruckus draws out Libyan tribesmen, Taureg, who think it is a German unit and have offered to return two prisoners in exchange for guns.Harker and company have no choice but to agree, and are surprised to find the prisoners are British traitors, Henry Portman and his daughter Cheryl. To Captain Bergman (whom they think is a Nazi officer transporting British POWs) they reveal they are delivering a document of agreement to Cairo, signed by Field Marshall Kesselring and also the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, the violently antisemitic leader of the Muslim world. The document stipulates that anti-royalist officers in the Egyptian army will launch a ""holy war"" to overthrow the British and thus draw the rest of the Muslim world to the Axis powers, Cheryl Portman pointedly noting Turkey can deploy a four million man army against Soviet Russia. The Portmans request transport to the outskirts of Cairo where they are to meet resident agents and thus deliver the Kesselring document. Bergman informs them that their radio was destroyed and they can only transport them to Tobruk, their nearest base, and from there they can transport the two traitors to their rendezvous.Bergman offers to execute the Portmans and thus not blow their cover, but Harker vetoes such a plan, intending to use the Portmans as a guarantee of entry into Tobruk. His increasingly condescending commentary to Bergman increasingly irritates Craig; a night before they are to reach Tobruk the column sets up camp in an abandoned town. Harker leads a final planning session for the raid where he notes a large transmitter is in the center of the city; if the raid must be aborted he intends to seize the transmitter to radio British forces. He further insults Bergman by condescendingly noting how he and his men volunteered for the mission. Craig then confronts Bergman for not defending himself in front of Harker; Bergman calmly replies that for all Harker's ""old school attitudes"" both sides will be there when they need each other.But that night a man sneaks into the room where Henry Portman is sleeping via underground tunnel and puts a gun to his head, telling him the column is a British commando unit, and that Portman and his daughter must leave the camp via the underground tunnel, go to a marker of stones a mile away that denotes presence of underground telephone cables, and fit a field phone to communicate with Tobruk, which will dispatch armored units to the campsite; the unseen traitor can't do it himself as he can't risk leaving the camp.The scared Portmans, with the field phone and a gun, find the cables, but are shot down by an Italian patrol. Bergman and his men, pretending to be Nazi soldiers, get the information they want from the Italian captain, then take the badly injured Cheryl back to the camp. With the girl in bed with a plasma tube, Colonel Harker orders Bergman's men to unload their weapons; the Captain refuses, so Harker has his men disarm the SIG soldiers. Cheryl is then killed via cyanide, and Lieutenant Mohnfeld (who'd been the first to see the Portmans had escaped) reveals that he spotted the traitor in the underground tunnel and when the two confronted each other he succeeded in knifing the man to death - Bergman, Craig, and Harker find it to be Corporal Bruckner, to Bergman's disbelief even with Bruckner's cyanide tablet gone.On the morning the commandos are to drive into Tobruk Craig confronts Harker, clearly fearful the raid will fail and tired of Harker's bigotry, but Harker will have none of it. The column enters Tobruk and passes through, passing the transmitter they may need to seize. It then passes a marshalling area where two German tank divisions have arrived undetected by British intelligence, making an amphibious landing impossible but with the fuel base - assembled via mammoth underground tanks, thus explaining their immunity to air attack - still a viable target.The column reaches the antiship batteries overlooking the harbor and Harker sends Lt. Boydon and Mohnfeld to get to the radio transmitter, just as RAF bombing begins. Boydon and Mohnfeld's half-track is hit by bombs and the radio tower smashed. Upon seeing Allied battleships begin firing on the shore for the landing, Harker has Sergeant Major Tyne use an orders lamp to send morse code to the ships to abort the landing. The commandos infiltrate the main shore guns as they open fire on the landing and succeed in blowing up one battery, while Tyne succeeds in turning the landing around - just as Rommel's tank reserves arrive to counterattack against the landing. A massive firefight erupts and the commandos are trapped on the beach, but Bergman and three others escape via motorcycles, while Krug and the two remaining SIG soldiers stay with Craig. Bergman and his men sneak back to the beach and with flamethrower and satchel charges blast several tanks and a number of German infantrymen, thus allowing Harker to evacuate his men from the beach. Craig, however, leads the three SIG soldiers further inland, where they spot a tank on overwatch and realize they can use it for a desperate final attack on the underground fuel base."

But then the stress of the job and the paranoid spies that come with a sensitive government position get to him, and he runs away. Now spies from all over the world are after him, either to get him for their own side or to kill him and prevent someone else from getting him.—Ken Yousten <kyousten@bev.net> Sidney Schaefer is a well respected psychiatrist, selected by the ""Central Enforcement Agency"" from his work keeping their agents working though some of the cases and activities their positions have required.

Furthermore, this brings him into conflict with the mysterious and dangerous Number 1.—grantss Hanada, who has a fetish in the smell of boiling rice, is widely referred to as the No. 3 hit man in Japan. While most of the others in the top five are known, the identity of No. 1 remains a mystery, some who believe he solely a legend that does not really exist. As a favor to Kasuga, a former associate who has fallen out of favor with the yakuza, Hanada agrees to assist him in a job commissioned by Yabuhara, a yakuza head, to act as bodyguards to ensure a client gets safely to a destination.

While the film does contain some spectacular action sequences, the story is played less as a suspense thriller than as a surrealistic, psychosexual nightmare, filled with grotesque imagery and strange touches, from Hanada's fetish for the smell of boiling rice, to Misako's use of a dead bird's corpse as a rear-view mirror decoration.—Anonymous"

Monica Rivers is the owner and ringmaster of a traveling circus, and she'll stop at nothing to draw bigger audiences. When a series of mysterious murders occurs and some of her performers die gruesomely, her profits soar. She hires high-wire walker Frank Hawkins, impressed by the handsome and muscular young man. They begin an affair which arouses her previous lover Durando's jealousy.

Meanwhile, the dead bodies continue to pile up.—alfiehitchie Being the ringmaster and having her name attached to The Great Rivers Circus, which is currently traveling through Britain, ostensibly belongs to Monica Rivers although she's only co-owner, having sold part-interest after her husband's death 6 years early; he had been one of the performers. She would buy out her business partner (and occasional bedmate) Albert Dorando, the circus' business manager, if she had the funds; only they two know that he is part-owner. The circus is already having a bad season when Monica sees the onstage death of one of her marquee performer as an opportunity: the public's morbid curiosity might just increase their future box-office receipts. (She doesn't see the death as tragic; she has the cold-hearted view that nobody is indispensable.) She is quickly able to replace the deceased's act by that of Frank Hawkins, an unknown quantity who has shown up out of nowhere. On the surface, his act ends up being truly death-defying. When another death occurs at the circus, this one obvious murder, speculation abounds that the first death was also murder. This second death not only starts to panic the other performers, many who believe Monica the killer as she has the most to gain and has shown little grief, but Scotland Yard investigates, assigning Superintendent Brooks to stay with the circus until the murders are solved. Beyond Frank's aggressive behavior since his arrival both in wanting a piece of the circus himself and wanting to be Monica's sole romantic interest, the situation becomes more complicated with the unexpected return of Monica's daughter Angela Rivers from finishing school. Will Monica demonstrate her maternal instincts compared to her cutthroat instincts for the circus business?—Huggo As the co-owner and ringmaster of a traveling circus, Monica Rivers (Joan Crawford) is always preoccupied with filling seats.

Both Martin Sheen and Tony Musante make their film debuts as the hoodlums.—alfiehitchie In the wee small hours of a Monday morning in New York City, a disparate group of 16, most traveling in pairs and trying to make their way home after a night out, are on the same subway car. Most are facing some issues, and their homeward journey is just a continuation of the problem that each faces in his, her, or their day-to-day life. Their tense quiet is shattered when Joe Ferrone and Artie Connors board the same car. Joe and Artie are a couple of menacing punks who just want to cause trouble for their own amusement; they've already violently mugged a man earlier in the evening for a mere $8. While Joe and Artie block the doors to prevent anyone from entering or exiting at any station, all the others on board who are lucid enough want to escape; the others passively watch the proceedings as Joe and Artie systematically direct their menace at each of the 16, one by one. What their terrorizing actions are able to do before the incident reaches its end is to bring to the surface the problems the passengers are facing in their lives.—Huggo"

Tinker Mason (Kenneth Cope) in a van pulls up behind her and adds some anti-freeze to her radiator. He tells her the Swan Inn she is looking for is just down the road to the right. He leaves and she waits for the engine to cool. All at once she hears a high-pitched humming sound.The old tramp goes into his cave where he has been living, but is soon disturbed by a high-pitched humming sound. As it gets louder, something approaches him. He backs away and scrambles to get away from it as it gets closer to him.Angela is seen driving down the road. Hanson steps out onto the roadway just as she passes.Meanwhile at the Swan Inn, Dr. Vernon Stone (Peter Cushing) has been served an ale by Frankie Callum (Sarah Lawson). They listen as the weather forecast is given by a radio announcer. It is said that the temperature is unnaturally high for the island of Fara. They discuss how hot it is.Angela drives up to see Tinker and Bob Hayward (Thomas Heathcote as Tom Heathcote) sitting outside with drinks. They watch as she carries her suitcase inside.Angela asks for Jeff Callum (Patrick Allen) and is told he is away by his wife Frankie. Angela announces that she is Jeffs new secretary. Frankie offers to show her to her room, but Angela requests a drink. Dr. Stone introduces himself and says he will pay for the drink. Bob comes in, bringing the two beer mugs and asks for a refill. He is served one. Angela says she wants to finish her drink in her room. Frankie leads her upstairs to the room and places her suitcase on the bed. Opening the window, Frankie says how hot it is. She notices in Angelas suitcase a copy of Jeffs last novel. Angela says she thought she should read it since she will be working for him. In the bathroom she is observed putting perfume on her neck. Frankie tells her she will inform her husband when he returns.Hanson arrives and asks if Jeff has brought the parcel he is expecting. Frankie tells him he is not back yet. Hanson insists that Jeff deliver it to his room immediately when he gets back. After he goes to his room, Frankie and Dr. Stone discuss how rude Hanson is. Frankie talks about how mysterious Hanson is, going out each day, setting up cameras and staying in his room the rest of the time. Stone suggests it sounds like material for one of Jeffs novels.Jeff is driving to the inn. As he rounds a corner, Bob is standing there on his bicycle and there is almost a collision. Jeff gets out and questions what Bob is doing there in the middle of the road. Bob looks confused but apologizes, saying he was not thinking. Jeff asks if he is all right. Bob says he is, but that he heard something: a strange whirring noise. Jeff chalks it up to Bob having had one too many.Arriving at the Swan Inn, Jeff greets Ken Stanley (William Lucas) who just loaded something into his vehicle. They joke about the weather and Ken leaves.Inside, Jeff greets his wife, who asks about his trip. He says it was good except for almost running over Bob, who was in the middle of the road. Frankie says Bob was fine when he left here and gets Tinker to agree.Frankie asks about the parcel Jeff brought for Hanson. She tells him Hanson is impatient to receive it. Stone tells him Hanson demanded it be brought up to him right away.

When they get there, they see Angela on the beach in a bikini. She waves to Jeff, who starts down toward her. Tinker leaves.Jeff tells Angela that she had better leave right away. Their former affair led to no writing and almost wrecked his marriage. Angela tells him that he cant just love a girl and then leave. She asks what he will tell his wife (who doesnt know about them). Jeff says that is his problem.They hear the high-pitched whining and wonder what it is. After it dies down, Angela and Jeff kiss.Back at the Inn, Tinker helps Ben Siddle (Jack Bligh) inside as Jeff and Angela drive up. Hanson notices this from an upper window. They sit him down at a table and ask what is wrong. Dr. Stone comes in to examine him. Ben tells them that his sheep are all dead. They take him to a cot in another room. Hanson seems especially interested in what killed the sheep. He goes to his room and places a red lens on his camera. Then he loads it into a bag with some film and leaves. Dr. Stone gives a sedative to Ben and tells them to let him rest.Jeff calls Bens wife to tell her that Ben is not feeling well but he experiences some interference on the phone line. He is unable to complete the conversation and hangs up.Angela goes up to her room to take a bath. Jeff comes in and warns her not to reveal their affair to his wife. Suddenly Frankie comes in, bringing some towels to Angela. Jeff hides in the bathroom with Angela, who takes a towel from Frankie without giving away that Jeff is hiding. After Frankie leaves, Jeff warns Angela again. She is amused.Tinker tells Jeff that the television is having problems. There is static and technical interference. Jeff wonders if it is from static electricity built up by the heat. Meanwhile, Bob also notices trouble on his television and asks his wife Stella (Anna Turner) if she did anything to the set. She replies that she never touches it. Suddenly the television explodes. He tells his wife to get a dustpan and broom. Still examining the television wires, Bob hears the whirring noise and is maddened by the heat. Going out to his car, he drives in misery, crashing through a fence and going over a precipice. His car burns.Meanwhile in the kitchen, Angela cools herself with an ice cube. Frankie and Angela talk about why Jeff would come to live in an out-of-the-way place like Fara Island. Angela suggests that Jeff is running away from something. When Frankie tells her she doesnt know Jeff very well, Angela confesses to the affair. Frankie expresses shock and disbelief. Finally Angela tells her she was lying in anger.Hanson goes out at night to look at the dead sheep. He makes a photo of one sheep. Next he is seen removing a knife from a metal box.Jeff and Frankie are sitting on a patio table as Angela joins them. Talk of the heat turns to the question of whether Jeff has seen Bob. He hasnt. He hands over his manuscript to Angela to type. Frankie goes inside. Jeff lights a cigarette and Angela comes out, asking for a light. When he goes over to her, she feels his trembling hand and places it on her chest.  You know you want me,  she says.The whirring sound is heard again by both of them. Frankie comes out and tells them that she saw something landing that made a whining noise. They go out to the hill and see Hanson returning. Frankie questions what Hanson is doing. They see nothing and Jeff again questions Frankie about what she saw. He tells them to wait while he goes to look. They tell him they dont want to wait in the dark and to wait until morning. He says he is tired of Hansons sneaking around and will go ask him what he is up to.Hanson is developing film in his room under a red light when Jeff knocks on the door and calls to him. He refuses to open the door, and Jeff threatens to break it down. Hanson tells him to wait a few minutes, but Jeff kicks in the door. Hanson angrily shuts the door to protect the photographs from being exposed to the light. Jeff questions Hanson about what he is doing and why he was on the hill that night. When he mentions about a landing, Hanson is eager to know what was seen. Jeff confesses that it was his wife who saw it. Hanson tells Jeff that he has been investigating an alien invasion the past week and that this is the source of the heat. Jeff expresses doubt about this. Hanson tells him that he ruined the photos he was developing. They go out on location where Hanson has the cameras set up. He shows Jeff some black cinders which he says were burned by something hotter than anything on this planet. As Jeff goes to see about a dog whining at the fence, Hanson calls Jeff to see what broke through the fence. They look at Bobs burned car. Jeff says they must warn others about this, but Hanson says not yet. He wants time to gather new evidence to prove the aliens exist.At the Inn, an old man orders a beer and takes it to a table where an old woman sits. Angela comes downstairs and is seen by Tinker and Ken, who wants to know where the girl was hiding. She says she will go to work on the typing.Jeff and Hanson come into the Inn. Hanson goes up to his room, and Jeff orders a bottle of beer. Frankie asks what the matter is, but Jeff snaps that nothing is wrong. He says the heat is bothering everybody. Suddenly the bottles of beer begin to burst. Frankie gets cut by the shattering glass, and Jeff goes to get a first aid kit. He looks for it in the room where Angela is. She is told about the bursting bottles. He looks at her with her blouse open and cant resist kissing her. At this moment Frankie enters and sees them kissing.Tinker, now affected by the heat, comes in and attacks Angela. They struggle and he throws her onto the couch and tries to rape her. She jumps up and hits the floor, where he continues his attack until she is able to hit him on the head. Tinker flees just as Ken, Jeff and Frankie come in. Ken puts Angela on the bed and goes to get Dr. Stone. Jeff and Hanson run after Tinker. Jeff struggles with Tinker, telling him to come back with him to the Inn. Tinker hits Jeff with a stick and runs off. Hanson approaches and Jeff tells him that Tinker got the best of him.Tinker runs to his garage and lights a welding torch. Looking through the door to see who is coming, he is horrified by something approaching which gives off a bright light and a tremendous humming sound. Dropping the torch, he runs behind a car. The car falls as the door slowly opens, the light shining from outside. Tinker covers his ears as the noise grows unbearable and screams. When Hanson and Jeff arrive, they see only burnt areas and a tank from which all the energy has been drained by the aliens.Dr. Stone is discussing what happened with Tinker, saying it is unlikely under normal circumstances. Hanson says these circumstances are not normal. Frankie comes in just in time to hear Jeff say that two men have been killed. She wants to know who. Stone tells her that Tinker met with an accident. She asks Jeff who the other man was. He tells her it was Bob. Jeff is getting excited and Hanson tells him to remain calm. He tells Frankie and Stone that Hanson believes aliens are attacking them. Jeff says the temperature is now 108 and the telephones are out. Stone suggests they go to the relay station where they can radio for help. He offers to go. Hanson brings him a two-way radio to keep in touch with them.Stone reports over the radio that the car is overheating. As he gets close to the station, the car stalls and he says he will have to walk the rest of the way. As he is looking at the car engine, he is approached by an alien force which produces the loud droning sound and emits a bright light. Stone screams as it closes in on him. Hanson and the others can only listen in shock.Jeff volunteers to go next, but Hanson convinces him that he is better equipped to deal with them. He gets the car keys and tells them to lock all doors and windows. Angela screams and Jeff runs to comfort her. She says she must have had a dream. The man was attacking her. He comforts her as Frankie looks on. She leaves the room, lost in thought. Jeff comes out and Frankie confronts him about knowing the girl before. He denies it at first, but finally admits he knew her before and that they moved here to get away from her. Frankie asks if he loves her. He admits that it was strictly a physical attraction and that his love is for his wife. He calls Angela a slut and admits that he wanted her.Angela comes out and wants the doctor. Jeff tells her the doctor cant come. She insists that she needs him. Finally under duress Frankie tells her the doctor is dead. Angela seems distraught.Hanson arrives at Stones car and finds the battery drained. He finds the radio and calls Jeff to report that Stone is dead, burnt up. He also sees a glowing light in the stone quarry and is going in. Jeff tells him to be careful.Hanson sees Stella and her dog searching with a flashlight. He thinks to warn her, but suddenly she and the dog cry out and flames are seen. Hanson retreats to the car, dropping his flashlight, which goes out. At that moment he realizes the aliens are attracted to the light. He calls Jeff and tells him to put out all the lights at the Inn. He says he will drive to the station with no lights on.At the station we see the radar operator (Barry Halliday) as he notices disturbances on the radar screen. He goes to call someone on the phone and the screen explodes. [This scene was also shown at the beginning of the film, just before the titles.] The electrical circuits crackle and pop. The droning sound becomes very loud and the aliens light reflects on the face of the screaming radar operator.Jeff, Frankie and Angela get restless and decide to drive to the station in Angelas car. Meanwhile, Gerald Foster (Percy Herbert), Hanson and Ken are viewing the burned out control room at the station. Ken says the radar operator was burned to a crisp. Hanson tells them that the aliens were attracted to us through the signals we send into space. Needing an energy source, they were drawn here in energy waves and materialized like a television image. Ken says we must destroy them before they destroy us. They go to get some explosives near the quarry.Jeff says the car is about to fail. Suddenly they run off into a ditch. Angela runs into the road and lies down just as Ken drives up. Jeff comes and they stand Angela to her feet. Ken tells them the radar operator was burnt up. He helps them get the car out of the ditch.At the station Ken says he and Gerald will set the dynamite. Jeff questions using the dynamite, which will light the area and attract the aliens. Hanson argues that there are no other ideas. He tells them to watch for his signal flare gun.Jeff tells Ken to look after Angela if things turn bad so he can stay with Frankie. At that time the flare is shot and seen. They advance to the quarry, where Hanson is setting fires with his flare gun. More flares are shot into the sky by Ken and Jeff. All at once Gerald, who has been throwing dynamite at the creature (who is now visible as a glowing glob) gets stuck and cant get out from where he is. Hanson shouts for Gerald to get away, but he is unable. Dynamite blasts go off near the creature. Angela runs down toward the fires with Ken following her. He catches her and tells her to come back with him. She tries to get away, but he persuades her to follow him to a stone building outside the edge of the quarry. Inside, she tells him not to tell her what to do. She curses him but he tries to reassure her that they should not give up hope. As he looks out the window at the explosions, she eyes the gun in his pocket.As lightning and thunder are heard, Jeff shoots more flares and tells Frankie to stay close. Hanson runs up and warns about the storm. Suddenly the creature is seen coming toward Hanson. Jeff shouts for Hanson to run, but he is overcome by the creature.Inside, Angela grabs the gun and turns it on Ken. He knocks it out of her hand, but she grabs it again, saying shed rather not be burned alive out there. He tells her to think of someone else for once in her life and to shoot him first. She curses him and he takes back the gun. The sound is growing louder and she holds her ears. He holds her.All at once rain begins to fall. Ken and Angela come out to watch. The rain kills the creature and they rejoice as it dies off."

It's been losing money for a very long time and the owner, Warren Trent, has been unable to renew the mortgage. His young and efficient general manager Peter McDermott thinks he can arrange a loan from a union, but it will mean giving the union a foothold in the local hospitality industry. Another alternative would be to sell out to Curtis O'Keefe owner of a major hotel chain who would very much like to add the St. Gregory to his portfolio but would destroy its character in the process. Among the guests in the hotel are the Duke and Duchess of Lanbourne. He is on the short list to be named British ambassador to Washington, but has struck a child with his car. Another guest is Keycase Milne, who is in the hotel to ply his trade - he's a thief.—garykmcd The St. Gregory is a grand, old fashioned five-star New Orleans hotel owned by Warren Trent, whose family built it eighty-five years earlier. In this day and age, it is seen as a throwback to olden times, for all its good and bad. The hotel's General Manager, Pete McDermott, who worked his way up the ranks, has tried to reverse its recent sagging fortunes by changing certain aspects where it counts - such as ending its official unofficial segregation policy - while resisting many of the modern yet impersonal conveniences. Regardless, the hotel is in trouble financially, and requires a major influx of capital to keep it afloat. Those problems are known in professional circles, and despite the hotel not being officially for sale, Trent has had an offer from a real estate developer, who wants to tear it down. He also expects an offer from Curtis O'Keefe, a chain hotelier whose hotels run figuratively and literally like machines, and who has come to stay at the hotel with this expected offer. O'Keefe has his own ulterior motives for wanting the hotel beyond expanding his empire. O'Keefe's travel companion is a beautiful Parisienne named Jeanne Rochefort, who doesn't much like O'Keefe but likes what he can provide her. She becomes an unwitting pawn in O'Keefe's bid for the hotel. McDermott is hoping that a deal with a hotel union - the needed capital in exchange for the hotel employees becoming unionized - is what saves the hotel in much its current form. While working through these financial offers, McDermott also has to deal with some day-to-day operational aspects of the hotel, including: a rash of robberies, which hotel authorities believe is being conducted by a known thief named Keycase Milne, whose M.O. is to use errant hotel keys to break into hotel rooms; a constantly missing hotel detective named Dupere; the supposed theft of the Jaguar owned by hotel guests Geoff and Caroline, the Duke and Duchess of Lanbourne, who know more about the theft than they try to let on; the reservation of Dr. and Mrs. Elmo Adams, who didn't mention that they were black when they made the reservation; and an aging elevator, which may play into the fortunes of the hotel more than McDermott realizes.—Huggo"

The Firemen's Ball,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061781/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A volunteer fire department throws a party for their former boss with the whole town invited, but nothing goes as planned. The volunteer fire department in a small town is having a big party when the ex-boss of the department celebrates his 86th birthday. The whole town is invited but things don't go as planned. Someone is stealing the prizes to the lottery and the candidates for the Miss Fire-Department beauty contest are neither willing nor particularly beautiful.—Mattias Thuresson The members of a Czechoslovakian town's volunteer fire brigade have organized a ball for the town, it which will include lotteries for a number of prizes that are prominently displayed on a table, the prizes guarded by one of their elderly members. At the center of the ball will be a presentation made to the now eighty-six year old former chair of the brigade of an ornamental ax. While they have long thought about giving him such a gift for his service, they don't want the appearance that they are only doing so now because he has cancer, the diagnosis about which they know but something they believe he himself has not been told. With a photograph in hand of all the young ladies of the town, most of who are at the ball, the ""entertainment committee"" comes up with an idea to hold a beauty pageant, choosing only eight of the young ladies in attendance to compete - they scanning the room to make their selections - with the ultimate winner of the pageant having the honor of making the presentation of the ax to the former chair. As the evening progresses, one thing after another goes wrong with the ball itself, with the organizers determined to go on as planned, even as disaster of a nature associated with them strikes outside of their four walls.—Huggo Key to understanding this movie is Milos Forman's own filmed ""introduction"" where he responds with faux seriousness to ""the protests by firemen around the country and around the world"" to his movie. He begins saying, ""well you know it's really about firemen, it's about society ..."" and then stops, smiles and says ""But you know what? It _really is_ about Firemen."" This movie was made in the last years before the beginning of the Prague Spring ...Now for the plot. A group of firemen at a station in a nondescript town somewhere in (still Communist) Czechoslovakia decides to honor its retiring chief at the upcoming firemen's ball. The planning committee for dance is hoping to put on a good dance, livening things up with a few small innovations. A raffle of prizes is promised as well as beauty pageant.Well, the committee proves to have no idea how to run a beauty pageant and as the dance continues the door prizes progressively get stolen. Finally, a fire strikes a house near the station. Distracted by the dance, the firefighters can't even get the fire truck out to the fire in time. The older man and his family who had lived in the house that has now largely burned down is found simply praying the ""Our Father"" as the helpless and rather embarrassed firefighters stand helplessly by..."

Marat/Sade,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060668/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In an insane asylum, Marquis de Sade directs Jean Paul Marat's last days through a theater play. The actors are the patients. July 13, 1808 at the Charenton Insane Asylum just outside Paris. The inmates of the asylum are mounting their latest theatrical production, written and produced by who is probably the most famous inmate of the facility, the Marquis de Sade. The asylum's director, M. Coulmier, a supporter of the current French regime led by Napoleon, encourages this artistic expression as therapy for the inmates, while providing the audience - the aristocracy - a sense that they are being progressive in inmate treatments. Coulmier as the master of ceremonies, his wife and daughter in special places of honor, and the cast, all of whom are performing the play in the asylum's bath house, are separated from the audience by prison bars. The play is a retelling of a period in the French Revolution culminating with the assassination exactly fifteen years earlier of revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat by peasant girl, Charlotte Corday. The play is to answer whether Marat was a friend or foe to the people of France. In the primary roles are a paranoiac with a skin condition (much as Marat had himself) as Marat, a narcoleptic with melancholia as Corday, and a sexual manic as M. Dupere. Coulmier feels he needs to intervene anytime during the performance when things get out of hand. The Marquis may have ulterior motives in the telling of this story, he who plays a large role on stage, especially in his discussions with the Marat character about the nature of the revolution and the differences in their individual motives concerning the revolution. As the inmates perform a story of revolution, they may subconsciously be sucked into the story mirroring their own struggles with authority. Real life and the actors' afflictions may also dictate how the performance turns out.—Huggo The Marquis de Sade is locked in the Charenton mental hospital and decides to put on a play. His overseers agree as long as he follows certain conditions. He writes and directs the other mental patients in a play based on the life of Jean-Paul Marat. As the play progresses, the inmates become more and more possessed by the violence of the play and become extremely difficult to control. Finally, all chaos breaks loose.—poco loco"

McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> Bagshaw had accused Bo of deliberately tripping him while taking a run during a game of cricket. Bagshaw's run-out was humiliating to him, as the match was being watched by Jane. Jane believes Bagshaw, and Bo is kicked out of the cricket club.
His reputation brought into disrepute by Captain Bagshaw (Peter Gilmore), a competitor for the affections of Lady Jane Ponsonby (Angela Douglas), Bertram Oliphant (Jim dale) West a.k.a. ""Bo"" decides to leave England and join the French Foreign Legion, followed by his faithful manservant Simpson (Peter ButterWorth).In Sidi Bel Abbes, the pair reach the local cafe with the female owner, ZigZig (Joan Sims).
Simmons peeks into her private cabins and sees a person lying in her bed. ZigZig tells Bo and Simmons how to enlist in the foreign legion.
The legion also has Commandant Burger , Captain Le Pice (Charles Hawtrey), Corporal Clotski (John Bluthal). The legion has received several threatening messages from Sheikh Abdul Abulbul.
Burger believes Bo & Simpson to be English spies as Bo cannot explain why he would want to join the Foreign Legion (gentlemen don't join the legion), and keeps them under close observation.The guy in the bed was Sergeant Knocker (Phil Shivers), who returns to the fort and claims to the Commandant that he was on patrol and killed 53 enemy soldiers. Knocker is decorated for his bravery.
Knocker observes that Bo has Simmons do all the errands for him, including running his bath and dressing him. Soon, they are buried neck deep in sand, when they are late for the morning parade.
Bo and Simmons realize that Knocker is the same guy they saw at the cafe with ZigZig, even though he claimed that he was coming back from patrol. The duo threatens Knockers with reporting to the Commandant about Knocker's truth. Knockers changes his tone and takes real good care of Bo. Breakfast in bed, excused from all parades, a proper bath tub (stolen from Burger) and so on.Meanwhile Lady Jane, having learned that Bo was really innocent (Bagshaw admitted he was lying when he heard that Bo joined the foreign legion, and tried to commit suicide), heads out to the Sahara to bring him back to England. Along the way she has several encounters with men who exploit the fact that she is naive and travelling alone.
After several such run-ins, including with the Legion fort's Commandant Burger (Kenneth Williams) (who incidentally once was her fencing teacher and joined the Legion in self-imposed shame after he had inadvertently cut her finger during a lesson). Burger guides Jane to the Cafe, but Bo had just left. Bo and Knocker have caught the eye of Abulbul, who asks belly dancer Cork Tip to lure them both to her home.
Meanwhile, Jane meets Sheikh Abdul Abulbul (Bernard Bresslaw) and ends up becoming a part of his harem and planned 13th wife.Knocker and Bo are kidnapped by Abulbul after being lured to the home of Cork Tip (Anita Harris), a belly dancer at the Cafe ZigZig. Simpson follows them to the Oasis El Nooki but is also captured. After entering Abulbul's harem and discovering Lady Jane, Bo and Simpson give themselves up while Knocker escapes (or rather is allowed to by Abulbul) back to Sidi Bel Abbes to warn Commandant Burger of Abulbul's plans to attack Fort Zuassantneuf.However, during this time ZigZig has told the Commandant about Knocker's true destination when on patrol and therefore upon his return his story is not believed. It is only when Knocker mentions Lady Jane that they realize he was telling the truth and the Commandant organizes a force to reinforce the fort.Along the way they discover Bo and Simpson staked to the ground at the now abandoned oasis. The relief column marches on towards the fort but heat, lack of water and a sandcastle building competition gone wrong decimates the force to a handful. The remaining members reach the fort to find that they are too late; the attack has already occurred, and the garrison wiped out.After learning that Abulbul's celebration of the successful attack includes marrying Lady Jane, Bo, Burger, Knocker and Simpson rescue her from his tent, leaving Simpson behind dressed as a decoy. When Abulbul discovers the deception, he chases Simpson back to the fort where, through the imaginative use of a gramophone and a German folk-song, gum Arabic, coconuts, gunpowder and a cricket bat, the group holds off Abulbul's army until a relief force arrives. The gramophones create an illusion that the relief forced had arrived much before it actually did, and held Abulbul from attacking full on. The gum Arabic is sticky and stops the attack in its track, as the defenders had laid it out in the attackers path.
However, Commandant Burger ends up as a (and the sole) casualty among the protagonists.
Jane tells Bo that his name is cleared in England, which means he can return home.Back in England the group reunites for a game of cricket, with Knocker having been promoted to Commandant and Lady Jane having conceived a son by the late Burger. Bo is batting but when he hits the ball it explodes. The bowler is then shown to be Abulbul having gained his revenge, to which Bo, with a broken bat and burnt clothes, and with a good nature responds ""Not out!"""

After expelling a ghost from a funeral home, Mitch and Ellen are sent to a small Illinois town to find the identity of a serial killer. But the government sends along a crackpot psychiatrist/playboy, named Dr. Alex Jordan, to oversee the case and possibly debunk Mitch's psychic abilities. When Dr. Jordan turns his sights on Ellen and plots to steal her away from Mitch, she goes to great efforts to prevent that from happening while helping Mitch try to find the serial killer.—matt-282 The film opens with a woman running down a corridor. A murderous and unseen man follows closely behind. The hapless woman falls victim to the unseen man who kills her and walks away with bloodied hands.The film switches to a man falling from an electrical power line pole. In his fall, the maintenance man releases the power line that he was attempting to attach. The cable is intercepted by a passerby named Cronin Mitchell, but before he can clear himself of the high voltage wire, it ominously thrusts into his face. Mitchell falls helplessly to the ground. An ambulance arrives, where the paramedics discover that the maintenance man is dead, but that Mitchell is still alive, but in horrible pain. They place him on a stretcher and take him away in the ambulance.In the next scene, bathed in a colorful psychedelic light show, Mitchell tosses and turns frantically in his hospital bed. Two doctors, named Dr. Roxin and Dr. White, examine him and it is discovered that Cronin Mitchell, due to this near-fatal electrical charge through his brain, has somehow given him Extra Sensory Perception. The two medical colleagues discuss Mitchell's horribly disfigured face and his apparent lack of will to live. One of the doctors, Dr. Roxin, convinces Mitchell's doctor, White, that his ESP is real due to a series of ESP test cards.After the disfigured Mitchell sexually harasses a local nurse who tends to him, she rebuffs his advances because of his scared face and tells him that ""a freak like you should have died!"" After leaving the hospital, Mitchell retreats from the public and dons a black scarf and dark sunglasses to hide his ugly appearance. Having lost his job and everything else, he begins giving private psychic readings out of his house for cheap prices. During a reading, a book titled 'Bible of the Witches' magically appears in his hands. Almost at once, an ugly hag of a woman enters and questions him about his psychic powers. Revealed to be a witch, the ugly hag makes Mitchell a proposition: in return for using her magic powers to restore his face to as it once was, Mitchell must agree to be her lover and slave. Mitchell agrees and his face is instantly returned to its normal state, and the hag disappears.Without delay, Mitchell leaves his house for the first time in months since his accident and begins to explore his renewed and enhanced life. In a dive bar, Mitchell encounters the beautiful Ellen Parker. But to his curiosity, Mitchell cannot read Ellen's mind. They retire to her apartment for some alone make-out time. Suddenly without warning, Ellen transforms into the the ugly hag and reveals herself, and orders him to keep his end of their deal. Mitchell very reluctantly submits to his slave status with this ugly witch.Meanwhile, another young woman is murdered by an unseen man. The newspapers report that this is the seventh murder in the past month. The police contact Mitchell and invite him to the small town of Jefferson, Wisconsin to help solve this latest murder by using his ESP.In Washington DC, Dr. Alex Jordan, karate-practicing playboy and psychic expert, is sent to Jefferson to verify that Mitchell is not a hoax, and to offer his professional assistance in apprehending the prolific serial killer. Detective Maddox of the Jefferson police force meets with Dr. Jordan and takes him to see Mitchell and his assistant Ellen, who is now accompanying Mitchell wherever he goes. Jordan is immediately smitten by the beautiful Ellen, but only Mitchell still sees her as an old hag whereas everyone else sees Ellen as a beautiful young woman. During the meeting to help find the elusive killer, Dr. Jordan suddenly produces a small container from his coat pocket and explains that it contains the hallucinogenic drug LSD. He advises Mitchell to take the drug and to meet with him the next day. Mitchell explains that he has no experience with the drug, but that he will, under the circumstances, do as he is asked.At a party, Mitchell is asked to demonstrate his extraordinary powers. He does so by levitating a chair to the amazement of the onlookers. The next scene is in a church where Mitchell summons a ghost that has mysteriously laid claim to the unfortunate house of worship. The apparition appears, touches Mitchell and leaves. Mitchell states to the priest of the church that the ghost will not return for ""she"" only needed contact with humankind.Meanwhile, Jordan is pursing Ellen to seduce her, but she rebuffs all his advances by claiming that she belongs to Mitchell and he is her one and only lover. Ellen further explains that she and Mitchell are meant to be together until death. Jordan then attacks her in a moment of misogynist rage, but she fights him off. In an act of revenge, Ellen tells Mitchell what happened and insists that he kill Dr. Jordan before he can try to force himself on her again. But Mitchell refuses to kill Jordan by conventional means and decides an alternative. During one evening, Jordan retires to his hotel room bed alone and in a truly bizarre scene, is beset by his blue bed sheets. However, Jordan resorts to karate chopping and ripping the living blankets and escapes unscathed.At the climax, Mitchell finally takes the LSD and during his ""trip"" (which is bathed in red light) he discovers that Detective Maddox is the serial killer. Somehow, Mitchell also surmises that the murderous and corrupt police detective intents to shoot him. Maddox does appear to kill Mitchell and shoots him right between the eyes. Jordan and the police arrive too late to help out, but kill Maddox as well. Despite Mitchell being dead, the case is solved with Dr. Jordan taking all the credit for finding the killer, which he decides to make the move onto Ellen.In the final scene, Jordan is with Ellen in his parked car making the moves on her. Ellen responds to his advances by kissing him in return. But just like Mitchell earlier, she suddenly transforms into the ugly witch hag. In horror, Jordan runs out of the car and flees from the grotesque Ellen/Hag. Jordon unwittingly runs head-on into a fire flare at an excavation site and falls to the ground with part of his face horribly burned. The hag approaches him and offers to heal his injuries and restore his scared face with magic if he agrees to become her lover. Jordan agrees... and the vicious cycle is to continue all over again."

But Foggers and his accomplice attack him, relieve him of the treasure and free Cole...—Guy Bellinger The movie opens with the credits rolling over the visual of two uniformed U.S. Army officers driving a horse-drawn Army wagon up a remote and rocky road in what appears to be the Old West. The audio is Roger Miller (King of the Road) singing the beginning of The Ballad of Waterhole #3: The Code of the West (Lyrics by Robert Wells). Miller never appears in the movie except in voice-over. He will sing a verse or two of the ballad throughout the movie to narrate and punctuate the action.'I'll tell you a story that's never been told
Of rapin and killin and government gold.
The place: Arizona; the year 84.
Sit back and I'll tell you some more.'A thirty-year captain just earning his pay
Was moving a shipment of bullion that day
While men without honor were waiting to test
The unwritten Code of the West.'Its the Code of the West: you must honor your neighbors.
The Code of the West, to your own self be true.
The Code of the West, you must do unto others,
Do unto others before they do it unto you.'The story is about the theft of 100 pounds of U.S. Army gold--an inside job pulled off by Sgt. Henry J. Foggers (Claude Akins), assigned to guard the gold, and his co-conspirators, Doc Quinlen (Roy Jenson), the mastermind of the caper, and Hilb (Timothy Carey), a billy-goat-bearded ruffian.The wagons destination is an Army warehouse. We see it arrive from a point of view inside a shoe parlor located next door to the warehouse. The shoemaker, Ben Akajanian (Harry Davis), is working on the sole of a cowboy boot, when we see that a gun barrel protruding from the rear curtain of the shop is trained on him. A voice says, 'Time to close up shop, shoemaker,' and Ben nervously moves to the door and shuts it, momentarily making eye contact with the Army officer, Captain Shipley (James Whitmore), who has got down from the wagon and is preparing to move the gold to the warehouse. Ben pulls down the shades of the shoe shop's windows.The inside thief, Sgt. Foggers, and his accomplices have built a tunnel from the shoe parlor to the Army warehouse, through which they will remove the gold. Quinlen waves the gun to summon Ben to the rear of the shop, where Hilb, chewing on a carrot says to Ben, 'In your hole, rabbit.' The three men move through the tunnel to the warehouse.Capt. Shipley, an earnest, if gullible, career officer, surveys his surroundings, then moves to the rear of the wagon and opens the covering. Two soldiers emerge carrying a strongbox, heavy for its size, marked 'Property of U.S. Army.' Shipley supervises their carrying the box from the rear of the wagon, to the door of the warehouse, upon which he knocks. Sgt. Foggers, referred to in the ballad as Henry J, is the lone soldier guarding the warehouse. He slides open the warehouse door only wide enough to accept the delivery. The captain apologizes to the sergeant for his inability to provide additional men to assist in guarding the gold, to which the sergeant responds, 'Sir, the Army's my home, and I would protect my home with my life.'As Capt. Shipley resumes his seat in the wagon, the gold is already moving through the tunnel to the shoemaker's shop. Cpl. Blyth, (Jim Boles) seated next to the captain, remarks, 'Thats uh, thats a lot of gold for one inside man to guard,' to which Shipley responds, 'Thats a lot of soldier, corporal.' 'Well, I still say its a lot of gold, sir,' to which Shipley retorts, 'Firm up! We're not civilians.' Through intercut scenes, we see that by the time the Army wagon begins to roll, the removal of the gold from federal custody is complete.'Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold,
You make a man fever, you make a man bold.'In the shoemaker's shop, the thieves are squabbling. Hilb wants to bury Shoemaker Ben in the shaft, but Quinlen says that the shoemaker is temporarily useful as an alibi--his disappearance will make him appear to be the thief, and if things do not go well, Sgt. Henry J. can claim to be meek Ben's hostage rather than a deserter. Ben complains, 'You cannot dispose of my life like it was a chess piece,' to which Quinlen replies, 'No? You do everything right, you have some hope. Do anything wrong, and I'll guarantee you pain.' As Quinlen digs his fingers into the pressure points near Ben's neck, causing Ben to sink to his knees, Quinlen continues, 'You understand pain?'Hilb wants to divvy but Doc Quinlen says he will bury the gold. Henry J. must step between Quinlen and Hilb to prevent a fight. The sergeants face says he is no happier with this plan than Hilb, but his words say, 'That's alright with me.' Quinlen will make a map showing where the gold is, and the three men will meet in the town of Delores in a couple of weeks to divide the loot. Hilb says, 'I may get there just a little earlier,' and Quinlen says, 'If you do, don't let me see you.' Hilb brays like a billy-goat to express his displeasure.Fast forward a couple of weeks: Two cowboys on horseback ride into town past a sign that reads, Delores.'So the town of Delores, that morning in May
Was in for an infamous day.'In a saloon in Delores we first meet Lewton Cole (James Coburn) dealing Three Card Monte to the bartender (Jay Ose) for the price of a cold glass of fresh milk. Cole is setting up the two cowpokes who have just arrived from the range. Enter Quinlen, who owes a gambling debt to Cole. Cole has pinched Quinlen's wallet claiming he is entitled to interest on the debt. When Quinlen shows concern only about one twenty dollar bill, which has written upon it in large letters, 'Mex' above a line, and in smaller letters, 'X Integrity' below the line, followed by an arrow along side three dots, followed by 'W #3', Cole deduces that this particular twenty-dollar note has significance beyond its monetary value. Angry that Cole now knows something, Quinlen challenges Cole to a shootout at sundown, and storms out of the bar.The bartender solemnly hands Cole his glass of milk, and observes that Cole has opened his mouth to the wrong man. Quinlen is a quick draw who will 'cut your pocket out as soon as you start to reach.' Cole replies, 'It does look like I stepped in it a bit,' sniffs the milk, and sits back down at the card table.One of the cowpokes (Buzz Henry) has used the distraction of the exchange between Quinlen and Cole to bend the edge of the Queen of Spades so that when the game of Three Card Monte resumes, he will know which card is the queen. The cowboy wins successive hands, so Cole quits. The cowboy, sensing that he cannot lose, begs Cole to continue, so Cole raises the stakes. He asks the cowpoke how much money he has, and agrees to play one more hand for the man's entire stake, as well as the stake of his buddy. Cole asks, Now you sure you want to do this? and the grinning cowboys eagerly nod, Yes. Their smiles evaporates when Cole's deal reveal that all three cards now have identically bent corners.Sundown has arrived, and as Cole moves to rake in all of the cowpokes money, Quinlen is heard calling out Cole from the street. Knowing that his life can be measured in minutes, because he will surely be shot dead in the street, Cole remarks, Lucky in cards, unlucky in love, then asks, Did I wash you out, boys? and graciously tosses them a few coins.Cole moves to the bar, and drops a few coins for the bartender, who, grave at the prospect of what is about to unfold, slides the coins back to Cole. Cole slides them once more to the bartender, gestures toward the cowpokes, and says, Buy the boys a drink.Cole leaves the saloon, preparing to meet his maker. The soundtrack is a rumble of dirge-like drums. Quinlen taunts Cole from far down the street You're yellow, Cole. Lets get on with it. The doomed man forthrightly moves to his horse, ostensibly for a handgun with which to participate in the duel. Instead, he pulls a rifle and, from 100 yards, guns down Quinlen.Against an early evening sky, Cole moves to Quinlen's lifeless body; out of respect, Cole doffs his Stetson, shakes his head as if to say, What a shame, and then removes the cash from the dead mans inside breast pocket.You don't draw with a stranger if he's faster than you.
You've sung your last ditty,
You've kissed your last pretty
And played your last hand if you do.As Cole rides off, Hilb emerges to stand over Quinlen's body. He rakes his spurs over the sprawled mans chest and kicks his thigh to confirm he is dead, doffs his hat, and emits his trademark billy-goat bray. Hilb replaces his hat and watches Cole ride into the darkening evening. Cole, bathed in the red glow of dusk silhouetted against a purple sky, examines the map and gazes toward the horizon.When fate is the dealer you raise or you call;
A chance-takin man plays the cards as they fall.
A map worth a killin is worth tracking down,
So off to Integrity Town.The next day, a column of Army cavalry led by Capt. Shipley, cantors past a sign above a water trough, Integrity 8 miles. When the cavalry has passed, Lewton Cole surfaces from being submerged in the water trough, sputters to regain the breath he has been holding, and resumes shaving and puffing a cigar.In the town of Integrity, Sheriff John (Carroll O'Connor) and his deputy (Bruce Dern), are discussing the sheriffs reelection bid, and the accounts of the heist in the newspaper. Everyone seems to think that Shoemaker Ben has taken the gold and hightailed it to Mexico. The sheriff has some ideas about how to recover the gold and wishes he had a nice theft to investigate. The deputy observes that Sheriff John has a habit of bringing thieves back dead and bringing back only half of the loot. The sheriff says, Half is better than none, aint it? He shares with his deputy that he had once planned to pull off a gold robbery, but had to give it up because he got elected sheriff. But Im gonna tell ya, if this job weren't so sweet and soft, I might just elect to follow the criminal profession. His deputy observes, You'd be real good [at it] too, John.Cole arrives in Integrity on the back of a wagon, carrying his saddle. His horse has gone lame. He moves to the sheriff and deputy to inquire about buying a new mount. The deputy tell Cole that the sheriff owns the best horse in the county, Old Blue, but the sheriff says the horse is not for sale.Cole, whose face is on a Wanted for Murder poster on the wall, tricks the two lawmen, and locks them in the sheriffs own jail, where he forces them to strip naked. In response to Sheriff Johns question, Why you doin this terrible thing to me? Cole dryly remarks, A naked sheriff makes a slow posse. As he leaves, he says, Being found locked naked, in your own jail, in an election year. Now, to be too noisy about it might be bad politics. Shhh. The deputy looks down at himself and then at the sheriff and says, He sure left us bare, followed by his signature phrase, Ain't that right, John?Cut to the sheriff's ranch outside of town, where the sheriffs fetching daughter, Billee (Margaret Blye), needs three more eggs for the batter of the chocolate cake she is making. She calls for the Mexican stable-hand, Francisco (Alex Tinne), but he is taking a siesta.A yellow-haired woman is early to bloom;
Her laughter is roses, her smile is perfume.
But the child of a lawman can die on the vine
With no man to taste of her wine.So, Billee enters the barn, where the hens nest and Old Blue is stabled, to find Cole changing his drawers. She smiles at Cole, and he returns the smile. Billee is then all business: Alright, what are you doin here? Cole says, Puttin on my pants. She asks, Well, what do you want? and he says, Well, I was gonna get on this big black horse and ride him outta here, butBillee moves toward the door, but Cole cuts her off. She says, Look. Im not alone. Cole points to where the stableman is sleeping in the shade, What? Francisco? What is he gonna do, challenge me to a duel? He dont have a gun. Billee says, Well my daddy does, and he's the sheriff of this county. Cole says, Yeah, I know; I seen him, and then eyeing Billees fine form, says, You must take after your momma. She buttons up her dress, and Cole reciprocates by unbuttoning his shirt. She informs him, You're gonna have to take it, and a wrestling match ensues. When he has her where he wants her, he says, Easy now; you're supposed to wear yourself out lovin not fightin. She gasps, You can't do it this way, and he says, Slow. Slow. Easy. He kisses her, and she returns the kiss.Some minutes later, a rooster crows, and Cole exits the barn leading Old Blue, and mounts him.Its the Code of the West: you don't leave for tomorrow,
The Code of the West, what can be done today.As Cole departs, Billee, disheveled, wistfully emerges from the barn.Its the Code of the West, its a true fact of livin
What's lovingly given will lovingly come back your way.Sheriff John arrives home, and orders his Mexican servant, Francisco to get Old Blue saddled. The sheriff, obviously preoccupied with the preparations to pursue Cole, notices his daughters disheveled condition and asks if she is all right. She is not sure. She says, I think he raped me. Incredulous, the sheriff asks, Who? Francisco? Billee says, dreamily, He was big. And tall, then remembering herself, adds, and mean, and cruel. Francisco interrupts, Padron. Blue. He is gone. What do you mean gone? and Billee says, I tried to tell you. Sheriff John, starting to get the picture, asks Billee, Wait a minute; was your man wearing a gamblers coat and a little brown vest, to which Billee replies, Part of the time. As the painful reality sinks in, the sheriff growls, Cole. The man must hate me personal.Sheriff John prepares to mount an ornery mule to pursue. He took my Big Blue out in that desert. Billee protests, Oh Daddy! Is that all you care about? The sheriff, eager to get after Cole, says to his daughter, Aw Billee, now Ill make it up to you. You know a man picks his pleasure from the nearest tree. Why if you weren't my own daughter--I mean there's worse things. He could've killed you. Now that a been worse, wouldn't it, I think. She angrily says, You bring him back. Yeah, I'll bring him back. My election to a third term as sheriff depends on it. And my honor. YOUR honor? Oh, darlin, I can only keep my mind on one offense at a time.The scene shifts to Cole on Old Blue:The desert was losin its fight with the sun,
As Cole stopped for water at hole #1.
Just what was he chasin he'd sure like to know,
But he still had him two holes to go.Oh the Code of the West: show your backside to evil.
The Code of the West, give the devil his due.
The Code of the West, you gotta do unto others
Do unto others before they do it unto you.The sheriff is checking the trail, but is having difficulty with the mule.Now rapin and killin ain't really so bad.
But stealing Ol Blue, now that made Sheriff John mad.
You don't help yourself to the eggs in the nest
Of a man with a badge on his vest.Sheriff John arrives at Hole #1. He says to the mule, Two waterholes to go. Were gonna get him at one of them. He dips his hat in the brackish water, and asks the mule, Do you want any. He takes a sip and says, Well, it ain't too bad. It ain't gonna get any better at the next one either.Nightfall. We see Old Blue meandering through the desert with Cole asleep in the saddle. The horse finds its own way to Waterhole #2.Poor tumbleweed stumblin from boulder to stone
Your permanent address is places unknown.
You eat when you're hungry, you drink when you're dry
If wishes were eagles, you'd fly.Cole makes camp beside Waterhole #2, puffs on his cigar, and doodles a stick in the dying embers of his fire. He covers the shallow pit with desert dirt, spreads his blanket over the now dead but still warm fire bed and curls up to sleep. Sheriff John, a few miles behind, is also done for the day.Rest your head on your saddle; dream of fortune and fame.Meanwhile, Billee sighs in her bed, and then moves toward the window.When the winds in the willow
A girl hugs her pillow
And wishes that she knew his name.Sunrise. Cole is back in the saddle, breathing in the desert air, and heading for Waterhole #3. A few hours later, the sheriff arrives at Cole's camp, and carefully examines a cigar butt that he has removed from the sand.Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Billee saddles her sorrel, and heads into the desert at the gallop. Cole surveys the landscape and rides on. The sheriff, hot on Coles heels, is still having trouble with the mule, who throws him into a sand dune. Spitting sand, John says, Damn mule, followed by his signature line, I wish you hadn't done that.Cole has arrived at his destination, and is wading waist-deep, peering at the bottom of Waterhole #3. Cole finds the strongbox, lugs it to dry land, when he becomes aware of another presence; he turns and is staring down the barrel of Sheriff Johns rifle. Good morning, Sheriff.Go ahead, go for that gun. I wish you'd go for that gun.Well, I don't need to now, sheriff. I got all of yours.Cole bends to open the box. The sheriff kneels with him, and reads the words on the box, Property of the U.S. Army, and asks, What's in it, General Grant's head? Cole guesses its bullion--the proceeds of the robbery in the news. If it is, its over a hundred pounds of that fine yellow gold.Cole fiddles with the lock. The sheriff says, You just get up outta there. Ill get it open. What the hell, Sheriff. I found it; I get to open it. Again, Cole gets the jump on John with his derringer, which he points at John's chest. Abruptly, Cole trains the pistol on the lock, fires, and holsters his gun. The two men gleefully discover the contents of the Army's strongbox.John regains the advantage. He permits Cole to change into dry britches, and asks him what the gold might fetch in Mexico. I imagine those thieves, if they got across the river without sinking too deep in the sand, and got by those Mexican bandits, and they knew how to make a deal down there, I imagine those thieves might get in upwards to a hundred thousand dollars.The sheriff relieves Cole of his stingy little gun, and has Cole arrange the gun's chain properly in the sheriff's vest pocket. Cole says, A little touch of gold always looks good on a man. The sheriff replies, Now I got something that will look good on you, and applies handcuffs. Cole says, I might just sue you for false arrest. I didn't break any law, Sheriff.No? What about stealin my horse?
I needed that horse to recover the gold.
Lockin me in my own jail?
I wanted you behind me.
Murder?
Self defense.
Rapin?
Assault with a friendly weapon?Cut to Billee, struggling to follow the trail, but determined.Now treat a girl tender, shell preen like a bride,
But take her for granted, she'll come for your hide.
She'll shoot off your head if you leave her behind,
And you'll lose your natural mind.The sheriff is bringing Cole back to Integrity. As the two men travel, the sheriff points out, Even if they don't stretch your neck, you'll be wearing a number into the twentieth century. Cole says, I got a number for you, Sheriff: one hundred and eight pounds of yellow gold in that saddlebag. You show me an honest sheriff and I'll show you a man without money.Cut to Sgt. Henry J. and Hilb, with Shoemaker Ben in tow, also on the trail of the man who stole the map. Back to Cole and the sheriff: Cole continues to use his magic tongue to turn the sheriff into an accomplice:You know, a man with money, he don't touch the principal.
He don't?
No. He lives off the interest. And there'll be lots of interest. He'll subscribe to a little railroad stock, or some cotton futures, maybe some corn, tobacco, sugar, wheat--all from his ranch, where he's got a fancy saloon and his own private gambling hall for a watering hole. And all them sloe-eyed senoritas just a hungerin...
After my money.
True, John, but you will wear out before you go broke.John and Cole stop for a meager lunch of beef jerky. While admiring the beauty of the desert, they share stories of their lives, their career choices and their loves; they bond.Sheriff: How come at your age a fella like you ain't tied down yet?
Cole: Well I was. Once.
What'd you do to her?
Well, I don't know, just got on separate trains, I guess.
That thing with Billee, course not being there I'll never really know, but what was that all about?
Just a hasty love affair. Nothing got bruised but her pride.
Well, you should have stayed to talk a bit. I always talk about five minutes before I run. You left her upside down.
Don't think on it, John. Think about something important like getting our gold to Mexico.John does not object to the concept of our gold. They are now partners, although when Cole lights John's cigar, we note that he is still wearing the handcuffs. Cole sings, Going back, going back, to Durango, and John joins him, where the sun goes down at noon.John and Cole continue on their way, talking. You always been wearin that badge? No, we ran cows after that big dry-up in 73. Cole responds, Yeah, we had some cattle until the government started taxin public land. The sheriff: Well, if it ain't the drought, if it ain't the hoof-n-mouth, the black leg, or the government throwin its hook into everything, it's always some damn thing, always. You're right there, John, and Cole gestures toward trouble: Sgt. Henry J., Hilb and the shoemaker have caught them.Hilb orders the shoemaker to search the men and remove their guns. As the shoemaker reaches for the watch chain attached to the derringer, the sheriff says, It's only a watch. Hilb says, I want it, whereupon the shoemaker turns the guns he has removed from the sheriff on Hilb, who spits and says, Drop them guns or I'll kill ya, and Ben, shaking like a leaf, drops them.Hilb is ready to shoot Cole, the sheriff, and Ben, but Henry convinces Hilb that murder at this juncture would not be advisable. Hilb points his gun at Ben, He knows everything, that shoemaker. Henry replies, What do we care; we'll be swappin tequilas with Ortiz at the presidential palace. Hilb points his gun at Cole, He killed Quinlen. Henry says, Well, you should thank him; you get a bigger cut. Now, ya see how everything works out? Turning to Cole, Henry asks, Not that it matters but, how did you know about Quinlen? Cole replies, You got time for a long story, sergeant? Henry smiles and says, Nah. Cuff em, shoemaker, on their ankles.Hilb says, We divvy, and Henry says, Why not. He throws a cord to the shoemaker to tie the men back-to-back. Henry moves the gold to his saddlebag, but first hugs it.Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold,
You make a man fever, you make a man bold.
Youre won like a woman, a treasure to hold,
Sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold.Henry stares at the bullion, Kind of makes your tongue coat up, and Hilb brays like a billy-goat. In the distance, the cavalry column gallops by. Henry says, My old outfit. To Cole and the sheriff, tied together, Bye now. The thieves mount, and as they depart with the gold and the horses, Henry says to Cole and John, As we used to say in the cavalry, Without a horse, a man's afoot.You make a man fever, you make a man bold
Sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold.Cut to Billee on her horse, checking the ground for signs of the track.Cut back to Cole and John struggling to free themselves, while Cole tells the long story that the sergeant did not have time for. And there was this twenty dollar bill with a bunch a doodlin on it. I didn't know what it was until Ol Quinlen made it important by not lettin me go without a shootout. Asked why he didn't stick around to clear his name, Cole says, I don't know, John. I guess I was just in a hurry to see what this man was so willin to die over. The sheriff says, The way things are gonna work out, you're gonna be a hero, and I'm gonna be the town jackass.Unknown to the two struggling men, Billee has arrived on the scene, but remains in the background while the sheriff complains about where Cole's finger is. Billee says, Well now, look at that. Thats something you don't see everyday: two big men, way out here in the middle of the desert, playin grapple-finger. When ordered by her father to cut out the smart talk and get over here and cut us loose, Billee says, Maybe, approaches, and delivers roundhouse blows to the belly of each man.She mounts her horse to go find me some Indians or some red fire ants. The sheriff, with Coles advice, tries to mollify her. I promise you this man, but I gotta have him first. Now you see that, don't you? Its a point of honor, and my duty. Billee, listen to me, I know I'm a fool and a sinner, but it's only your poor dad you'd be turnin loose if you did it. Billee. She reluctantly gets off her horse to help.The only knife is in the front pocket of Cole's britches. She reaches her fingers in and Cole encourages her. Deeper. She frees her father, but refuses to untie, Cole. Instead, she cocks a gun at him. Cole says tenderly, Go ahead [and shoot me]. It was worth it. She looks him in the eyes, and asks, What's your name anyway? and John says, Aw, Billee, quit foolin around. Here, gimme that gun. John takes the gun, saying, His name is Lewton Cole. I thought you knew him.All three climb aboard Billee's horse. As they start off, Cole asks, Where are we goin, John? and the sheriff says, Integrity guards the pass to Mexico, don't it? Well, our best chance is if they lay over in Integrity. Billee, seated between the two men, squirming, says, What about my rape! to which John says, Forget about it. Were after gold!The three alternate positions: one walking and two riding, then the men walking, until nightfall finds Billee and Cole on the horse, with John walking alongside, leading the horse. Cole hugs Billee. Billee says, I should have shot you back there, and Cole laughs and says, You never woulda shot me, and she says, right in that deep pocket. The sheriff smiles. Cole asks, What did you want me to do anyway, bring you candies and flowers? and she says, No. I wanted you to do the decent thing, and Cole asks, Which is what? and she says, Well, if you don't know, what's the use of talking. Cole: What does that mean? Billee: Think about it. Cole laughs and says, Oh, no, Billee, we don't want to start thinking about it. That takes us too far from the point of it all. She looks back and asks, What's that mean? and Cole says, Think about it.Well she thought, and he thought, and like it or not,
The colder she acted, the warmer he got.The horse takes a misstep and the three are thrown, with Cole and Billee tumbling down an embankment, and Cole ending face-to-face on top of her. She says, Has anybody ever said anything about your style? John yells, Thats your fault, Cole. If you hadn't a been doin what you oughtn't a back there, this never woulda happened. Come on Billee, get out from under him, and lets get goin.The thieves have arrived at the outskirts of Integrity. Sgt. Henry J. tells Hilb to stay to guard our flank, while he and the shoemaker head for the hotel, and then to a brothel operated by Lavinia (Joan Blondell). Ben plays the organ, while Lavinia greets Henry. He opens his saddle bag to give her a peek, and she says, Looks like you robbed the Army. He asks, Do I have the house for the night? and she says, Your credit seems good. The place is empty of other customers because the town council is meeting and the sheriff is out chasing a man who locked him in his own jail, and in a very unusual condition.Henry moves to the eight prostitutes and says, All right girls, and in military fashion, Present arms! whereupon the women descend on Henry, squealing with delight. Henry kisses as many as he can.Hilb, at his post outside of town, spots the approaching three on horseback, and hightails it to the hotel, where he barricades himself in an upstairs room. The sheriff, Cole and Billee, riding at the gallop, are again thrown, this time in front of a desert shack. The man inside, pokes his head out the window and says, Get the hell off my lawn.They run into town, and the sheriff exclaims, Cole, there's Old Blue, tied up in front of the hotel. Cole is carrying Billee over his shoulder, his hand firmly on her butt, as she yells, Put me down! Put me down! The sheriff says, Put her down before she wakes up the whole town. Cole: You're gonna have to tell me why you named her Billee. John: Her ma and me was tryin to make a boy. Cole: Well, you didn't even come close.They enter the hotel, check the register, and ask George, the hotel clerk (Robert Cornthwaite) about the men registered as Smith and Wesson in 301. The sheriff asks the clerk for his guns. The clerk hands a pistol to the sheriff, saying, I've got one of two Colts were taken off of John Wesley Hardin by Constable John Selman after he shot Hardin behind the right ear in the Acme Saloon in El Paso on a Monday afternoon.The clerk produces a second handgun: This 32 caliber rimfire Hopkins & Allen was almost smuggled in to Bill Longley before they hanged him high, October 11, 1878, in Giddings, Lee County, Texas. Cole: Does it shoot? The clerk: Beautifully. Cole: Thank you very much, George. Ill try and return it in the same condition.The sheriff and Cole move upstairs.When a showdowns a comin, when a shootout is due,In the lobby, George says to Billee, Oh, I forgot to tell them. The big and the little one checked in, stayed long enough to get some stuff, and then went right out.Billee: Where'd they go?
George: Well, you know...
Billee: Lavinia's! As Billee runs upstairs, George says, Did I mention the scary one?Face up to the danger, throw a slug in a stranger
Before he throws one into you.Billee delivers the current situation to Cole and her father. Cole asks her to go downstairs to ask George for the key to 302, opposite the room in which Hilb is holed up. Billee tells Cole to go down himself, whereupon her father kicks her in the butt and tell her to go on down like you're told and get that there key. As Billee moves away rubbing the place where she has been kicked, Cole observes, She sure moves fine, and the sheriff says, Aw Cole, dammit.At Lavinia's, Henry is having a good old time, while Lavinia herself takes an interest in Ben. He tells her the story of his abduction, and says, I am getting ideas. Lavinia cautions him: Don't get reckless, Robert. He corrects her, Ben.Meanwhile, the sheriff and Hilb eye each other's hotel room doors through their respective keyholes. Cole has taken a position at the window to monitor Hilbs only route of escape. Billee tries to tell her father her side of what occurred in the barn, but John dismisses her with, Not now, Billee. She says, Daddy, don't you care? Doesn't it mean anything? which he ignores, and asks Cole, You reckon he's still in there? Billee moves to Cole and demands to know, What have you done to us? to which Cole replies, Believed your eyes and not your words, Billee. She says, All right. If nobody cares, I don't, and flops on her back on the bed. Cole reacts to her implied offer, and John scowls, Not now, Cole.At Lavinia's, Henry, laughing and wearing a pink garter as a headband, heads upstairs with two of the women, while the others wave. Lavinia takes Ben upstairs.In the hotel room, John is impatient. He asks Cole to tell him again about living off the interest, but Cole says, You gotta grow your own dream. Suddenly worried, John asks Cole if he is thinking of giving him some kind of second-card deal. Cole says, I'm not dealin this hand.You gotta do unto others, do unto others, before they do it unto you.The standoff continues until dawn. A drunk cowpoke, (Buzz Henry, who is also the film's stuntman) rides his horse beneath Hilb's hotel window. Hilb drops a note on his head, written on a pillowcase, HELP HELP. I'm a prisoner in room 301. FiFi LaFlame.The cowboy rides his horse into the hotel lobby, runs upstairs, and is taken by Hilb at gunpoint as a hostage to shield Hilb's escape. In the lobby, Hilb mounts the horse and, amid gunfire from Cole and the sheriff, gallops toward Lavinia's. In his haste, he drops his share of the gold in the middle of the street. As gunfire is raining down, he cannot retrieve the fallen treasure.The sound of the shootout awakens the denizens of the brothel. Whatever Ben and Lavinia have been doing together invigorates Ben and makes him reckless. The sergeant comes downstairs, but is almost struck by bullets from a crazed Hilb, who is returning fire at anything that moves.Crying, My gold! My gold! Hilb wheels his horse, and continues shooting until, out of ammo, he rides out of the movie, crying and braying like a billy-goat.The sheriff moves to retrieve the saddlebag containing half of the gold. Henry takes a shot at him, but retreats. Cole gallops toward John on Old Blue, and dismounts. John places the saddlebag on the horse, and says, Well that's it. I got mine. Cole says, Thats good John. Now you can help me get mine. The sheriff is preparing to leave, and Cole says, Hell, this hand isn't over yet, is it? The sheriff says, All right, Cole, and the two plan how they will attack Henry.Henry is creating a defensive position in Lavinia's, destroying the brothel in the process. Lavinia desperately saves a painting of a younger version of herself, and tells Henry he will have to pay for the damages. He replies, as he frantically moves furniture to create a barricade, I always pick up my broken glass, and tells Lavinia that she has to talk the sheriff out of this fight.The condition of the premises does not improve as Cole and the sheriff take the gunfight inside. Using shotguns, they are taking out doors, walls, mirrors and chandeliers wholesale. When Lavinia screams, You are about to shoot-up my meal ticket, the sheriff says, while reloading, This is official business. I'll get the town council to pay for any refurbishments.As the fusillade intensifies, and a piece of pottery explodes, Lavinia cries, That vase was brought around the horn! This is a home, not just a house, you bastards!During a momentary lull, as the men reload, Cole calls for a hiatus, so We can talk a spell. Henry asks, What's your proposition? The sheriff responds, Your life for that gold. That's the proposition. Well? Henry says, I'm thinkin about it. Do you know how hard I had to work for that gold? The sheriff says, Ain't that terrible, Cole? Why, in another minute he'll have us believin he earned it.Henry then sees out the window Shoemaker Ben being lowered in a sling made of bed sheets. The hookers are helping him escape with the remaining gold. Henry runs outside, and the other two follow. The shooting continues, as Henry is both pursuing Ben and protecting his own hide. John has a strategy, and Cole reluctantly agrees to attempt to execute the more dangerous maneuver.While Ben was playin steal the gold, and make your getaway,
The other three played shoot-em-up and turnabout's fair play.
But Ben had tasted painted lips and heard the sirens song,
So he could hardly keep from goin wrong.From the upstairs windows, the hookers are signaling to Ben with their undergarments to assist his escape.Its the Code of the West: heed the word of your sisters;
The Code of the West, make a left turn from sin.
The Code of the West, keep an eye on temptation; recite the quotation
That says, When-Satan-calls-your-name-it doesn't-matter-how-you-play-the game-cause-all-he-cares-about-is
Did you win?Henry pursues Ben to an outhouse; Ben slugs Henry in the face with the saddlebag filled with gold, and is able to escape. Cole and John are destroying the shack with their shotguns, so that Henry is forced to use a woman's corset to waive the white flag of surrender.Cole demands, Sergeant, where's the gold? and Henry points to the shoemaker mounting Old Blue. All the gold is now reunited on the horse with Ben.Now Cole and John and Henry J. were feelin mighty sad,As Shoemaker Ben escapes on John's horse with the gold, the sheriff says, Oh Blue! Hell let anybody ride him.To bank a little sack of gold, could turn a good man bad,
But when you pick the meek and mild against the brave and bold
The meek inherit all the Army's gold.The three men have forgotten their fight, and join forces to pursue Ben. Billee, on foot, yells, Hey wait for me! and runs to the livery.Now, in the meantime Billee-girl was schemin on her own.
She knew a healthy sweet young thing can't live by bread alone.Billee emerges from the livery stable on her own mount at the gallop.To play the tricky game of life a woman needs a plan.
To play the game of love she needs a man.Ben has ridden Old Blue into the encampment of the cavalry. His three pursuers also gallop into the hands of the Army. Cpl. Blye summons Capt. Shipley from his tent, who dons his cap: Well, what have we here? Corporal Blye, put Sgt. Foggers, Henry J., U.S. Cav., under arrest immediately, and to Henry, You were supposed to be guarding the Army's gold.Henry salutes, Sgt. Foggers, Henry J., reporting sir! He took me as a hostage until I got the best of him; pointing at Ben, The foreign shoemaker, sir.Ben stutters trying to defend himself. Capt. Shipley, Well it fits. It was his tunnel. Sgt. Foggers, if this is true, the Army has lost a deserter and gained a hero.Shipley continues, Cpl. Blye, arrest Lewton Cole for the murder of Doc Quinlen.Cole: Oh captain, captain, sir. Self defense. See, Doc Quinlen found out that I found out that shoemaker and him was plannin that whole gold robbery. I was forced to do it to save the Army's gold.Capt. Shipley: Well, Mr. Cole, if what you say is true, you're in for a nice reward. Turning to the sheriff, Honest John, did all of this transpire as my sergeant and Mr. Cole have related?John: Ah yes, captain. You might say these men were acting as my deputies in the recovery of the gold.Shipley moves toward the sheriff, No reward for us professionals, eh, John? Of course, you'll get your recognition come election time. Corporal Blye! Arrest the foreigner.Ben: I am innocent. I am the only innocent.Capt. Shipley, laughing, They all say that, don't they John?Ben: I was the hostage.Sheriff, sharing the captains laugh: Ain't that terrible, captain?Ben: It is hopeless.Capt. Shipley: Hopeless, eh? You are asking me to doubt appearances. He points at Henry, The Army; at John, The Law, and at Cole, Professional enterprise. Corporal Blye! Haul him away. Careful, he's a dangerous man.Ben refuses to be handled: No man hauls Ben Akajanian. I walk free; alone. Thank you.As Ben is led away, the captain smiles at Henry, Sgt. Foggers, and walks toward him, Henry J., where is the Army's gold?Its in the saddlebag, sir, but there is nothing there except rocks. Get that shoemaker back here!Billee arrives at the camp. Capt. Shipley greets her, What a pleasure to see you here, Miss Billee.She points at Cole: Arrest that man, but the captain says, It turns out that it was a case of self defense.Billee says, I don't care about that. He forced his affections on me.Captain Shipley and Cole exchange smiles, Miss Billee, there is not a court in the land who would convict with a ravishing beauty like you for a witness. And who on the jury would not do the same thing if given the chance.Bens response to interrogation is stony silence. Everyone leaves to find where Ben has stashed the gold, leaving only Billee and Ben in the Army camp. Billee asks Ben, Do you trust me? Cole backtracks in time to see Billee gallop off, leaving Ben alone.Now Lewton Cole knew Billee had some mighty fetchin ways
Ole Ben would tell her everything, and still get ninety days.Billee cantors to a spot in the desert near some boulders.Beneath the rock, beside the trail, that leads to Mexico,
You'll find yourself a hundred pounds, or so.Its the Code of the West: every girl needs a dowry.Billee finds the gold and smiles, Now I've got you, Lewton Cole.The Code of the West, and it don't matter who.Billee loads two of the four bars of bullion into the saddlebag on Old Blue.The Code of the West, when a girl's pushin twenty, shes got to give plentyBillee picks up the other two bars, kisses one of them, and loads them on the horse.To end up with rice in her shoe.A hand holding a small bouquet of native goldenrod enters the foreground of the frame. Cole's voice: Hello there, Billee honey.Billee: You! What are you doin here?
Cole: I just come lookin after you.
Billee: You're after the gold.
Cole: Oh well, that too, but uh, What about partners?
Billee: What kind of partners?
Cole: What kind of partners did you have in mind?
Billee: Full time.Cole takes a moment to think over this proposition, then asks, You take me like I am?Billee melts, walks over to Cole, takes the flowers, smells them, smiles, removes Cole's hat, and kisses him. The two sink out of the frame, leaving the camera unfocused on the desert hills.The cavalry, seen from overhead, cantors on its way to the sound of a bugle. Cut to Ben sitting forlornly on a rock; Lavinia's carriage arrives, driven by her houseman, The Prince (Rupert Crosse). Ben, relieved, says Lavinia. I thought you would never get here. Lavinia smiles, and Ben gets in the carriage. They ride to where Ben hid the gold. The cavalry is also riding to the spot where the gold has been hidden.Cut to Lewton Cole donning his jacket, and placing goldenrod in the band of his hat.Well, Cole had a few other things left to do,
He flowered his Stetson, and boarded Ol Blue.Billee (naked): Hey! Wait a minute! Where ya goin?
Cole (on his horse): Durango. Thats the way I am. Bye bye.The rougher you treat em, the stronger they grieve.Billee, now dressed, reclines on a rock watching Cole in the distance riding off.And the longer they watch when you leave.The sheriff and the sergeant arrive at Billees location and circle her on their horses, but ignore her, asking each other where they are headed. Lavinia's carriage arrives. The sergeant yells to Ben, Hey shoemaker, are you gonna tell us where the gold is? Lavinia pulls a gun, points it at John and Henry, and says, Go and get it, Ben.As Ben gets out of the carriage, the Army arrives. Shipley demands, Where is the Army's gold?Ben: 'Where is it, Miss Billee?'Billee uses the goldenrod bouquet whose aroma she has been admiring to point toward Lewton Cole, who can be seen riding Old Blue on the rim of a distant ridge.Old Mexico is just ahead, so gambler move along.
There ain't nobody there to care if you did right or wrong.
You shot a thief, you found some gold, you stole a kiss or two,
And the world's a better place because of you.Oh the Code of the West: When you're drinkin tequila,
The Code of the West, toast the Red, White and Blue;
The Code of the West, be good to your neighbors--
Your new northern neighbors--
Remember they were awful good to you.THE ENDThe Paramount Picture LogoThat's the Code of the West!Roll the Cast of Characters."

While Charlie's old harem flocks around him as soon as they board the Catalina ferry, Don catches the eye of Charlie's sister, Tina. While he likes Tina, he is attracted primarily to Katrina, who is visiting the island with her fiancé, Angelo. What Don, Charlie and their group of friends are initially unaware of is that Arthur and Anne Duval, the upscale parents of their new friend Tad, are the masterminds behind a recent theft of an ancient scroll from a Los Angeles museum. They have a buyer for the scroll, the cutthroat art collector Lakopolous, who has among his henchmen Angelo. Using Anne's artistic skills, they however are planning on making a duplicate, selling the duplicate to Lakopolous, returning the original, and thus pocketing the $500,000 sale price. Complications ensue when the scroll, in a watertight canister, gets lost in the ocean. The Duvals try to use their son's new unwitting friends to scuba dive for ""lost treasure"", the kids having no idea what they are diving for. But their lives are placed in danger as Lakopolous' men, including Angelo, are also searching for the lost scroll and will kill anyone who gets in their way. But another party, who gets into one scrape after another, seems to be watching every move most specifically the Duvals make regarding the scroll.—Huggo In a mansion overlooking a beachfront, a man named Lawrence (Jim Begg) sneaks through an elaborate art collection, and makes off with an ancient scroll.The next day, Charlie Moss (Brian Cutler) and Don Pringle (Tommy Kirk) arrive in California after finishing their University classes in Arizona. Charlie is bringing Don to visit Catalina Island, as Don has spent his entire life among the desert setting.While on the boat, Don soon becomes enamored with a dark-haired girl staring off into the ocean. Don attempts to get to know her better, when Charlie takes him aside with some other teenagers, and they dance and listen to Little Richard sing a song on board.Eventually, the ship arrives at Catalina Island. As Charlie disembarks, three girls immediately accost him a romantic fashion. Don watches the dark-haired girl depart, and goes to the arms of another boy. Lawrence departs and presents a cane to a man with a sailor's hat. The two depart soon after when a man in a grey suit appears right behind Lawrence.Lawrence and the man in the sailor's hat depart for a boat in the Catalina Island harbor. the sailor-hatted man is Arthur Duval (Peter Duryea), who has come to Catalina with his wife Anne (Sue Casey), and their son Tad (Del Moore). Though Tad doesn't know it, Arthur and Anne have hired Lawrence to steal the scroll. Their plan is to have Anne make a copy of the scroll, and pass it off as the original to a Greek man named Lakopolous (Lee Deane). Once he has purchased the fake scroll, Lawrence will return the real one back to the art collection he stole it from.Arthur, Anne, and Lawrence's moment is spoiled when a young woman in a boat almost sideswipes their yacht. The young woman it turns out is Charlie's sister, Tina (Venita Wolf). After the close-call, Tina meets up with Don and her brother, and the three then meet Arthur, Anne, and Lawrence, along with the Duval's son Tad. Charlie invites Tad to join them on a scuba diving party, but Tad declines. Even Arthur tries to get Tad to go, but the young man suspects his father may be up to some crazy scheme on Catalina.Afterward, Charlie, Don, and Tina go scuba diving not far from the Duval's yacht. However, trouble brews aboard the yacht when a man in a scuba suit comes aboard, claiming to come for the scroll for Mr Lakopolous. A scuffle ensues between Arthur and the man, and the scroll in a watertight case ends up falling into the water. The man attempts to escape, but Don and Charlie see what has happened, and attempt to subdue him. Their efforts are for naught, and the man gets away.Don and Charlie board Arthur's yacht, as well as a member of the harbor patrol. Arthur claims the man was after his wallet, and the others accept this explanation. Once they leave, Lawrence voices his concern that they've lost the real scroll, but Arthur says that he's confident they can get it back before Lakopolous sends his divers to retrieve it.After the excursion, Tina, Don, and Charlie go to a beach party along with Arthur's son Tad. However, the party atmosphere changes when the dark-haired girl Don saw on the boat appears, enchanting almost every other man on the beach. Tina then attempts to hook up with Tad to make Don jealous.Soon after, everyone heads off the beach to another function, but Don stays behind. As he watches the water, he sees the dark-haired girl calling for help. It soon becomes apparent that she has lost her bikini top, and Don gives her his jacket to cover-up with. Upon thanking him, the girl explains that her name is Katrina Corelli.Don attempts to get her to join the others, but she claims she's waiting for her boyfriend, Angelo. When she asks Don to help her, the two venture down the beach where they find Angelo. Angelo is upset to see Katrina with another man, and Don takes his leave. When Katrina asks Angelo what he has been doing, he dismisses her questions, claiming he should not have brought her to Catalina. This causes Katrina to leave him, and return to Don.Don has returned to the others, but when Katrina shows up, Tina gets jealous and wanders off. As Don's talk turns to what happened to Angelo, Katrina reveals that he came to Catalina to help a man named Lakopolous, as well as being hired for his sea-diving abilities. The group then begins to wonder if Angelo may have attacked Tad on his yacht, when Tina is heard crying for help out in the water. However, instead of Don saving her (as she expected), the man with a hat who was trailing Lawrence off the boat does. This leads to every other girl on the beach growing jealous of Katrina, and marching off. Soon afterwards, the teens reconcile on a boat to the sound of a grooving tune.Later on in the day, Arthur and Lawrence find our gang, and proposes a scuba contest, promising a $100 reward if they can find the watertight cases at the bottom of the harbor. The gang goes for it, but during the 'contest,' the previous diver along with Angelo shows up. Another scuffle breaks out, and the two divers get away, but not before Arthur finally confesses to his son why they are really on Catalina.Afterwards, Tad, Don, Charlie and the harbor patrolman discuss a plan to catch Angelo and the other man who attempted to assault Arthur. Their plan soon leads to Angelo being arrested, but not before his accomplice takes off with a container that should contain the scroll. The chase finally ends when the man with the hat from before knocks the accomplice into the water, but manages to retrieve the scrollcase.The man with the hat then identifies himself as Fingers O'Toole, who has been trailing Lawrence and Arthur. He attempts to arrest Arthur, but upon looking in the case, finds the scroll inside is gone! With no evidence against Arthur, Fingers sadly loses his man.The real scroll it seems has been safely taken away by Tad, who has managed to sneak back into the mansion and return it.In the aftermath, Lakopolous leaves Catalina Island, sad that his attempted art treasure has gotten away from him. Back on the island, everyone else is dancing down by the docks to a swingin' tune."

Theatre of Death,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062358/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Theatre of Death in Paris specializes in horror presentations. A police surgeon finds himself becoming involved in the place through his attraction to one of the performers. When bloodless bodies start showing up all over town, he realizes there could be links with the theatre.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Horror, murder, mystery and mayhem make up the principal ingredients
of the Theatre de Morte. New director Phillipe Darvas [Christopher Lee], son of the old
director, vows to dedicate his life to the theatre, as did his father. At
the opening night cast party, patroness Mme Angelique [Evelyn Laye] requests that Darvas
give a preview of coming attractions, so Darvas asks Dani Gireaux [Lelia Goldoni] and
newcomer Nicole Chapelle [Jenny Till] to perform a scene from 'The Witches of Salem'.Darvas first hypnotizes the scared Nicole who then performs so
realistically that Dani's boyfriend, Dr. Charles Marquis [Julian Glover], interrupts the
scene when it looks like Nicole intends to burn Dani's face with the hot
poker she is brandishing. Charles, a police surgeon recuperating from a
hand injury, is meanwhile investigating the deaths of 3 women, all stabbed
in the neck with a sharp item, all drained of blood, a situation known to
police as 'hemaphagia', to the public as vampire. Since the instrument
used seems to resemble knives used in one of the performances at the
Theatre of Death, Charles suspects that Darvas may be involved.Meanwhile, Darvas takes a liking to Nicole and, thinking he can make
an actress of her, he begins to probe her life, her motivations, her inner
secrets. When Darvas asks Nicole to move into his theatre apartment with
him, Dani becomes upset. Her concern is that Nicole is too young and
vulnerable to get mixed up with Darvas, but Darvas sees it as jealousy and
fires Dani on grounds that she is mentally unstable, as she recently spent
two years in a mental hospital. When Charles gives Darvas a ride home and
probes him about the hemaphagiac murders, Darvas becomes agitated. Is
Darvas the vampire?The next day, Darvas's cape is found covered with blood, but no body
is found. The murders stop but Nicole acts as though Darvas is still with
her. Is Darvas really dead? Is Nicole hiding Darvas somewhere? Charles and
Dani decide to 'babysit' Nicole. They move into the theatre apartment with
her and follow her everywhere, but she leads them nowhere. Suddenly, the
murders start up again--a prostitute on the dock, a young woman coming
home from a date. Then Darvas's decomposed body is discovered floating in
a pond. Whatever Darvas might have been, he isn't the hemaphagiac murderer.One evening, Dani, Charles and Nicole have dinner in a Romanian
restaurant. Nicole plays her guitar for the patrons, and the restaurant
owners wife recognizes the tune as Romanian. The names Constantine and
Anna engraved into Nicole's guitar remind them of a gypsy family with whom
they escaped Romania in 1946 by crossing the Italian Alps in February. The
small caravan became entrapped by an avalanche in a little-traveled pass.
One of the men killed the horses, and they ate the meat. But Anna's baby
could not eat meat, so she killed one of the other children and fed his
blood to her child. That child's name was Nicole. Could Nicole Chapelle
and the gypsy baby Nicole be one and the same?Then Dani discovers a script written by Darvas just before his death.
Entitled 'The Caravan', it tells the tale of a gypsy caravan caught in an
avalanche and of a mother killing one child to feed his blood to her baby.
Dani now knows for sure that the baby is Nicole Chapelle. Yes, Nicole
killed those women to satisfy her need for blood. Yes, Nicole killed
Darvas because he was about to unveil her story. Now Nicole must kill Dani
to safeguard her secret.Nicole hypnotizes Dani to confess to all the murders, then she forces
Dani to stab herself. But Charles interrupts them in the nick of time.
Nicole escapes, runs to the theatre where she hides under the stage and is
accidentally speared during the final scene of the show. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Like the previous victims, she has puncture wounds on her neck and there are no leads as to who might be what the London newspapers are calling ""the King Vampire,"" the most cunning, criminal mind ever encountered by Chief Homocide Inspector Marsh [Ron Brogan]. It's as though the vampire knows every move the police intend to make. Inspector John Brenner [Ron Doyle] heads down to Wamsley Lane, the site of the most recent victim. Unfortunately, the residents are extremely tight-lipped, untrusting of the police and preferring to take matters into their own hands. Only one old woman, Mrs O'Shea [Margaret Moore], is willing to describe the king vampire...tall, slender, dressed in black. Look for the face of a corpse, she says, and you'll find him. The next day, Brenner tells Marsh that he's gotten a description of the vampire from Mrs O'Shea. That night, however, Mrs O'Shea is murdered by the vampire. When Brenner returns to Wamsley Lane to investigate the death of Mrs O'Shea, the neighborhood residents have already found a suspect, and they proceed to beat their suspect to death. Did they get the vampire? Apparently not, because three more murders happen after his death. Brenner offers Marsh a theory: Suppose the King Vampire isn't a man but a woman? Nah, couldn't be, Marsh poohpoohs the thought. No woman could commit such heinous crimes. Brenner leaves Marsh's office, after which his secretary, tall, thin Miss Clark [Karen Joy], pounces on Marsh's neck. [Synopsis by bj_kuehl]In the ""Count Alucard"" episode, Harker [Roger Gentry] continues on foot to his destination...Castle Alucard...when the coach driver will go no further. There he presents the Count [Mitch Evans] with the deed to his newly-purchased London home, Carfax Abbey. That night, as Harker sleeps, vampiress Medina [Karen Joy] enters his bedroom. Just as she bites his neck, there is a knock on the castle door. The Burgermeister [Vic McGee] has followed a vampiress to the castle and requests Harker's help finding her. Harker joins the search team in the cemetery where they locate two coffins. They stake the vampiress lying in one coffin, but the other is empty, so they wait. When Medina returns to her coffin, they stake her. Harker returns to the castle, intent on destroying the Count, too, so that the Count can't drain the blood of the villagers. Harker needs it for himself. Harker turns into a werewolf and pounces on the Count. [Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Hallie Rodgers, a background dancer on the Los Angeles based Whiz-Bam music show, has tried to get the show's producer, Fred MacElwaine, to let her be up front and center on the show as a solo singer - she even having had auditioned and impressed - but, despite leading her on, he won't give her the opportunity until she establishes herself as such by producing a record. When Cliff and Hallie meet at Stan's Cellar, a small Palm Springs club owned by Stanley Krumley where Cliff is performing, Cliff senses an opportunity for Hallie based on something he saw her do on the show, that opportunity being a song and dance combination which he names ""The Tantrum"". Cliff will help in any way he can, except what she really wants which is for him to be by her side performing. Cliff's resolve is strengthened when Stan brings in his brother, renowned music producer Tony Krum, an eccentric and neurotic man, whose role would take the place of what Cliff would have done behind the scenes. Part of Tony's grand plan is for Cliff, as the established performer, to do what Hallie wants in this matter in performing with her to give her a jump start in the business. But what Tony also tells Hallie as a task but not Cliff is to make Cliff fall in love with her and ask her to marry him, all as a publicity stunt. Although Cliff and Hallie do fall in love for real, a question becomes if the professional and personal lives of the two can mesh regardless, especially if Cliff finds out about Hallie's secret task.—Huggo"

Sleazy music promoter Boojie Baker convinces a pop band to come work for him. He arranges play dates, publicity, record contracts, and the band's loyalty by getting his hired girls to exercise their feminine charms on all who stand in his way. Thus he creates the new music sensation, The Big Blast, but the band is unhappy about Boojie keeping most of the money. When they try to leave, Boojie sets them up for trouble with the law, but offers to bail them out if they sign the contract. Can't anyone stop this scumbucket?—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> In Chicago, a ruthless and greedy talent manager named Boojie Baker (Dan Conway) ""discovers"" then exploits unknown rock bands. Opening up at a nightclub, one of Boojie Baker's protégé acts, a band called Charlie who have clearly been put through the grind already, griping about the royalties they've been fleeced out of, walk out on him.Undaunted, Boojie and his loyal, but dim-witted assistant Gordy (Ray Sager) walk into a local bar for some cheap drinks and they discover a new band performing, (played by real-life Chicago garage band The Faded Blue). Promising them a recording contract and ensuing fame, Boojie renames the five-man group 'The Big Blast,' outfits them in designer suits, and sets about to prime them for stardom. This is done by utilizing a bevy of attractive and loose women to seduce a recording engineer, photographing him in the heat of the moment, then blackmailing him into letting the Big Blast cut a single. During the Big Blast's first concert appearance, Boojie bribes the same group of young women to run up on stage a rip the uniforms off the group as a way to further promote their supposed popularity.The group cuts their big hit, and Boojie presumably uses similar tactics to promote the record and garner airplay. Soon, Boojie and Gordy take the group on tour through the state from appearances all over Chicago, to concert appearances coast-to-coast. In one take away from the story, Gordy takes the group out one day for some lunch and they stop at a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) place where the manager, (played by none other then the founder of KFC himself, Colonel Harlan Sanders), lets the group perform a musical number right out in front of his restaurant in exchange for giving them five free buckets of fried chicken.As the months draw by, it doesn't take long before the band begins to wonder why they aren't receiving any money for their labors. When the Big Blast confronts Boojie in his office about their suspicions that he is swindling them out of their money, they demand a larger percentage of their sales. A hard line negotiator, Boojie refuses to budge in that respect, and welcomes the boys to seek fame in fortune in other avenues, while he secretly continues to squander all of the money that he receives by buying expensive clothes and luxury items for himself, as well as to squander the cash on prostitutes for his daily carnal urges. To show there are no hard feelings, he even invites them to a party at his apartment.Turns out this party, replete with liquor, women, and marijuana, is a setup, and a ""police detective"", named Lt. Kronsky, shows up to raid it. Coincidentally, this is before Boojie arrives, and when he does, it seems that he also has some pull in the ""police department"". As it happens, he is able to bail the boys out of this serious legal jam if they agree to sign new contracts which will give him a bigger percent of the profits they make, and expands their contract with him by five years instead of two. One by one, each of the five members concedes to Boojie's demands, with the drummer Tom being the last to succumb. Incidentally, after they leave the apartment, the ""detective"" hits up Boojie for some of the grass. It turns out that the Lt. Kronsky is an old friend of Boojie who help him set everything up.Back in the studio, the group begins to unravel, internal bickering starts to swell, and they just can't seem to cut their follow-up hit. During this time, the band makes a background check on Boojie, and they discover that Boojie was fired from his job as a talent agent at a big agency office a few years ago for ""mis-use of funds"" as well as suspected embezzlement of company money, but he was never brought with crimminal charges becase there was no evidence. As a result of this revelation, the Big Blast; Ron, Dennis, Tom, Ralph, and Chris, decide to bring down Boojie at the expense of their own fame and fortune by sabotaging a television appearance Boojie has lined up by showing up drunk and singing a thinly-disguised musical flipping-of-the-bird to him. The group then rips up Boojie's contract to them, in which he and Gordy storm out of the studio, presumably to go look for another rock and roll band to manage and manipulate. ""Oh well, that's show business,"" Ralph of the Big Blast says.The film ends with a zany MOS montage of the band which was clearly inspired by the comic stylings of the Beatles movies of 'Hard Days Night' and 'Help!', which were directed by Richard Lester, even if the end result falls a bit short."

Nishanath as a judge hanged at least eight people, but after his retirement, due to lingering moral regrets, he has sheltered a few homeless people, who have either long criminal records or other qualities that make them social outcasts. Byomkesh listens to everything and accepts the case. Sen pays him the advance and requests that he visit his nursery.Byomkesh meets a Bengali movie expert, Ramen Mullick, and comes to know about the movie producer's son Murari. He learns that, when Murari was making love with Sunayana, he was murdered in his own room. 20,000 rupees and many gold ornaments were also robbed from Murari's room. Suspecting Sunayana's role in the murder of Murari, a court issued an arrest warrant against her, but she disappeared and her whereabouts are unknown. Ramen gives the details about the actress and also about the film and promises to assist Byomkesh whenever he needs him.The next day, Byomkesh and Ajit visit Sen's bungalow and nursery in the 24 Parganas district to meet the residents whom Sen has sheltered. Byomkesh comes disguised as a Japanese horticulturist named Okakura, while Ajit appears as his Indian assistant. Sen shows them the entire nursery including dairy, poultry and an orchid house. He introduces all the residents and Byomkesh photographs everyone. Within a few days, Sen makes another phone call to Byomkesh requesting him to visit again, but the conversation remains unfinished as Mr Sen is bludgeoned to death with a blunt weapon. Byomkesh and Ajit are visited the next day by a police inspector who wants there help on the murder Sen, not knowing of Byomkesh's pre-existing relations with Sen. Byomkesh and Ajit return to the colony and interrogate everyone concerned with Sen's nursery. After a thorough investigation, Byomkesh realizes that the case will not prove easy to solve, as there are several motives and people behind Sen's death. After a few days, another murder occurred inside the Golap Colony: this time the victim is Panu, a deaf-mute and one of the suspects who witnessed Sen's murder. Panu's killer used the same weapon and method as was used to kill Sen.Byomkesh again reaches the spot, examines everything and decides to records the interrogations with his voice recorder. He interrogates all the suspects: Bijoy (Mr Sen's nephew), Rasiklal, Muskil Mian, Brajo Das (employees of Sen), Nepal Gupta (a professor) and Dr. Das (a physician and sitarist), and all the women, including Mrs Damayanti (Sen's widow), Mukul (Nepal's daughter) Nazar bibi (Muskil's wife) and Banalakshimi - one among the list of suspects. Byomkesh takes an old photograph of Sunayana and tries to match it with all the women under suspicion, but he is unable to make a match.Shortly after the latest round of interrogations, Brajo comes to Byomkesh's house and confesses about his lord's personal life. He says that Damayanti Sen was not Sen's legal wife but a live-in partner. Many years ago, Sen sentences Damayanti's husband Lal Singh to death for a criminal case. But Lal is not hanged, but rather imprisoned for 14 years because of the concession given from a high court. Lal later kills a person to steal his car. He takes many parts of the car and throws them through Sen's bungalow window every fortnight to threaten him. Lal often visits Damayanti secretly for money. But Byomkesh's investigation reveals many other possibilities too. He finds a tape of Dr. Das playing his sitar in the doctor's room; this tape was played in the background during the murder of Sen (the tape was heard by Byomkesh through the phone). Byomkesh also finds that Bijoy abandoned Mukul for Banalaxmi. Byomkesh knows that Sen would not have agreed to the relationship of Bijoy with Banalaxmi, so there is a chance that Bijoy murdered Sen in order to marry Banalaxmi and inherit Sen's wealth.In his room, Byomkesh notices a plastic flower, which triggers a new line of thinking in him. He quickly takes the photo of Sunayana and compares it with the four women's photos and goes for a detailed analysis. He calls everyone and finally reveals Dr. Das as the person behind the murder of Sen and Panu. Dr. Das earlier said that he was playing sitar in his room when the murder was happening. But this statement was dis proven when Byomkesh found the tape that was playing in Dr. Das's room during the murder; the argument that he was in his room playing his sitar was Das's alibi. Byomkesh shows them the stolen jewelry and contract papers of 'Sunayana' which Das was hiding for a long time. Banalakshmi, the employee of this nursery, is revealed as the actress Sunayana and the wife of Dr Das. She declares that she underwent plastic surgery to change her face (which Byomkesh realized while contemplating the plastic flower). Finally Banalakshmi confesses that her husband exploited her beauty to make money and how he murdered Murari, Sen, and Panu to destroy all the evidences of his criminality."

It is an ordinary morning. Martin Kleshay and his wife Virginia finish their ordinary breakfast. Frustrated and bored with their lives, they sit back, lost in thought, dreaming away their ordinary reality.Erotic Salad is a morning of their dreams, a mad assortment of secret exploits, a tossed salad of outrageous sex fantasies!With a little imagination, Martin Kleshay, timid, impotent, and confined to a wheelchair, is suddenly the swashbuckling hero of his own melodrama. He is young, dynamic, a devoted photographer, and the wealthy publisher of Fettish, a popular men's photo magazine.He approaches his work with a religious dedication, and his photo sessions are delightful lampoons of their real-life counterparts (such as a mock fetish scene in a bathtub, with the alluring young model ecstatically rubbing raw chickens and chunks of raw meat over her body - complete with an absurd background of ice skating music. Or two girls staging the familiar sado-masochist whip photos to an inspiring orchestral score of cathedral selections).As his fantasy unfolds, he is searching for new and exciting photos for his next issue. His technique, however (sneaking up a fire escape to photograph two people making love through their bedroom window), has its drawbacks - he is discovered, chased madly through the streets and nearly caught.And there is worse to come. He has unwittingly photographed ""Frank the Hat"", notorious underworld figure, who immediately sends his accomplice, the tall, beautiful Carena Zoomex to retrieve the film.In the confusion that follows, Carena finds Martin, but he gives her the wrong film. Angered, she returns, luring him to a bizarre party and finally to her own apartment. In her bedroom, Martin, ever present camera around his neck, and to a funny soap opera organ accompaniment, attempts to make love to her, camera and all.But she has secretly drugged him and he suddenly topples over unconscious. When he wakes up he finds himself on the floor, chained and helpless. Carena stands over him, dressed in black, a wide leather belt in her hands. She beats him sadistically, pours wine in his face to torment him, and revealing her connection with ""Frank the Hat"", tells of their plans to murder him.In this last desperate hour, however, the dynamic photographer comes through. Still chained, but suddenly inspired, he struggles to reach his camera lying just a few feet away. The erotic image of Carena towering over him with her black leather belt and tall sensual body is the perfect photo for his magazine. Grabbing his camera he frantically begins photographing her, promising to make her a Fettish centerfold. She is charmed, she is convinced, she unties him, and they run off together.Meanwhile, back at the breakfast table, Virginia Kleshay, irritable, domineering, and less than alluring in her robe and haircurlers, has dreams of her own.Glamorous and uninhibited in her fantasies, she is busy seducing an unsuspecting plumber who has come to repair a leak in the bathroom. Soon, from another room, Martin calls to her, but Virginia is lost in passion, thrashing about, under the sink.The next dream finds her at the dinner table making reckless advances to an insurance agent who has come to talk over her husband's policy. Suddenly losing control, the agent sneaks under the table, shaking and grabbing at her in wild eyed excitement. Martin, however, sees nothing and continues to discuss his insurance. Finally Virginia and the insurance man sneak off to the bedroom, and while Martin, still unaware, chats to them from the next room, she quickly undresses and tumbles into bed with her new lover.A weekend orgy is Virginia's final exploit. Martin is away at a health spa and a strange assortment of friends fill their apartment, lying around half nude, drinking, smoking pot, and partying.But Martin comes home early, and in a ludicrous scene wheels innocently into the room, to find his wife sprawled on the floor, drunk, nude, legs waving wildly in the air, and making love to another boyfriend.The shock is too much for her devoted husband. His mind shatters, and he enters a bright colored world of hallucination.In the center of an immense stage Martin Kleshay stands transformed - in a long low cut gown, red high heeled shoes, black feather boa, bright red lipstick, blue eye shadow, and black mustache. A glamorous showgirl in his own theater. Nine young figures, dreamlike, and totally nude, appear behind him, and the cast is complete.The audience cheers wildly and Martin breaks into song, moving seductively across the stage and dragging his long feather boa behind.Suddenly his world shifts, the figures turn against him, strange images appear, he is lost in his own play. He cowers on the floor bathed in bright colored lights and surrounded by bodies, jumping, nude, hostile bodies. The audience jeers, scenes flash by, faster and faster. Then everything stops. He is back in his wheelchair, the figures around him are suddenly still - naked characters in an exhibitionist play. He wheels quietly past them.And a timid Martin and a frowzy Virginia drift back to an old reality, back to breakfast, back to each other, back to bored silence and cold coffee."

Aman,1967,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233193/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Meloda (Saira Banu) who was educated in India, speaks Hindi; though she is Japanese. Dr. Gautamdas (Rajendra Kumar) is a UK trained doctor who volunteers to go to Japan to help deal with the horror of the radiation aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They meet in Japan and the inevitable happens when hero meets heroine. Lord Bertrand Russell in London, gives Gautam his blessings and best wishes for his travel to Japan. Russell , a pacifist and anti-war thinker (who appears in a cameo role) sets the tone of this 1967 film. On arrival in Japan Dr Gautamdas takes up a role in a hospital where Meloda's father Dr Akhira (Chetan Anand) is director. The storyline takes us through the stark and sometimes gory suffering that radiation victims endured; as a stark reminder of the long term damage caused by atomic weapons. A majority of the shoot sequences are in Japan, with director Mohan Kumar taking artistic liberties in switching from the Ginza strip, with pan shots of the Mitsubishi tower, the Hokkaido and with glimpses of Mt. Fuji. A scenic gondola ride, ski fields are all part of the package. Lata Mangeshkar's rendering of the fusion song ""aisuru"" is set to a musical score that is drawn from both cultures Shankar. Mohammed Rafi sings a few forgettable, but apt to the storyline songs. A group of fishermen are exposed to radiation from French nuclear tests in the Pacific, Dr Gautamdas mounts a daring rescue to help save the fishermen. Battling angry elements Dr Gautamdas helps the fishermen survive, saving every last one of them - but at what cost? When viewed in the context of India-Japan relationship, beginning with the arrival of Buddism in Japan, formation of the Indo-Japan Society in 1905, Japan's support for Subash Chandra Bose's INA this film takes on a meaning beyond a love story. It is a cry against the horrors of atomic weapons, the enduring damage they inflict and martyrdom for a cause.—mg-gopalan Dr. Gautamdas (Rajinder Kumar) attains his qualifications in London, England, and with the blessings of Lord Bertrand Russell (himself), returns to his home country and his dad (Balraj Sahni). Much to the disappointment of his dad, Dr. Gautamdas decides to re-locate to Japan, which has been devastated by the explosion of atom bombs on two of it's cities - Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There he meets with other doctors, and is given a tour of the patients and their families, and other survivors (Om Prakash, Chand Usmani, Baby Kavita). {Graphic scenes of the atrocities inflicted on innocent people} On a chance meeting with the beautiful Meloda (Saira Banu) he knows that they are destined to be one, and so does she. Meloda's dad is also a doctor (Chetan Anand). Meloda had studied in India and speaks Hindi fluently. Both fall in love amongst the splendour of Japan. This is Bollywood's homage to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a must see movie for all. All the songs are memorable, penned by Hasrat Jaipuri, and Shailendra, and set to the music of Shankar and Jaikishan.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"

He starts talking to the audience about how his life is boring and nothing ever happens around his castle. He complains that the only amusement in his life is a life-sized rag doll which he introduces out of the book (a very freakish-looking Raggedy Ann). King Cole claims that all that 'Rag Doll' does is sleep all day. He continues talking about how it will take a magician to make him feel happy. Then a big booming voice appears and, out a plum of gimmicky smoke, appears Merlin the Magician. Merlin (who when he occasionally talks, speaks in a booming echo voice) proceeds to wake up Rag Doll into a dance routine and proceeds to do magic tricks.After performing more illusion tricks, several more freakish-looking costumed characters run onto the stage whom include Chicken Little, the Honey Bear, etc. where King Cole introduces Merlin to them. After King Cole tells the characters to leave, Merlin captures the Rag Doll and performs another illusion by placing her in a box and using the 'swords through the box' trick. Rag Doll reappears and King Cole sends her on her way. Next, King Cole has a court page produce a large box and asks Merlin what do to with it. Merlin produces a 'Jack' out of the box who does a dance routine.Next, King Cole brings out his three violin fiddlers (one man and two women) to play a violin melody, and then the Jack in the Box has a dance off with Rag Doll. Next, King Cole and his Court Page set up another illusion trick with a large empty barrel drum on top of a plank where Merlin performs another trick involving Rag Doll appearing out of the barrel.Next, Princess Beauty appears and asks King Cole and Merlin to help her find her Prince. After sending King Cole away, Merlin makes the background curtains dark and puts Princess Beauty to sleep where he performs another illusion of levitating her off the floor. After Merlin settles her on a sofa, Prince Charming appears where he sings a song and wakes up the Princess with a kiss and together they perform a song melody ('Never Before And Never Again'). Just then, the tint of the scene turns red and a Wicked Witch turns up to cause trouble for Princess Beauty, Prince Charming and other storybook characters. The Witch freezes the storybook characters when Merlin appears and he and the Witch have a magic duel between them (involving cheesy light and sound effects). Merlin puts the Witch in a box and kills her with another illusion involving fire and the Witch becomes a skeleton.After banishing the Witch's bones away, the red tint fades away and Mother Goose appears out of the large book on stage where she un-freezes everyone and turns the background curtains to normal. Mother Goose tells the Prince and Princess and the other storybook characters to return to the book, which most of them do.Merlin then performs another illusion involving Jack in the Box (now played by a woman) involving the cube box magic trick. Afterwords, Mary-Mary appears looking for her little lamb and faces off against the mute and troublesome Rag Doll over it. After Mother Goose argues with Merlin about how to make Mary happy, he performs another magic trick involving making Mary's bouquet of flowers blossom, which she takes them back into the book with her.Merlin then performs another illusion trick involving the disappearing milk trick. Afterwords, Little Bo Peep walks in looking for her sheep, which Rag Doll starts a fight with her for no clear reason by stepping on Bo Peep's foot and kicking her in the rear. The fight has to be broken up by King Cole and Mother Goose who then calls Merlin out once again who produces a sheep for Bo Peep (a plastic model) who takes the sheep and disappears (due to trick photography).King Cole finally decides that Rag Doll should be punished for her antics and has her placed in the book which she fades out. Mother Goose tells King Cole that he must return to the book, but first he wants to say goodbye to Merlin, only to see that he is no longer around. Then Merlin's booming voice speaks to them from above telling them that he has served his purpose to entertain them and they must continue his work by entertaining for others in the stories of Mother Goose. King Cole then returns to the book and waves goodbye as he fades away. Mother Goose then returns to the book after waving goodbye to the audience. Fade out."
