Top Gun,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As students at the United States Navy's elite fighter weapons school compete to be best in the class, one daring young pilot learns a few things from a civilian instructor that are not taught in the classroom. US Navy Lieutenant Pete Mitchell, call sign Maverick--an impetuous, daredevil pilot ace--is accepted into Top Gun, Miramar's elite Fighter School. But there, the impulsive young pilot will have to compete with the best of the best, including Iceman, a brilliant and highly competitive fellow student. Now, Mitchell must give his all; however, his father's mysterious and untimely demise still haunts him. Can Maverick prove his worth to Charlie, the flying school's no-nonsense astrophysics instructor? Will he be able to suppress his wild nature to win the prestigious Top Gun Trophy?—Nick Riganas Devil-may-care navy pilot Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is sent to Miramar Naval Air Station for advanced training. Here he vies with Tom Kasansky (Val Kilmer) for the coveted ""Top Gun"" award. When not so occupied, Mitchell carries on a romance with civilian consultant Charlotte Blackwood (Kelly McGillis). Shaken up by the death of a friend, Mitchell loses the Top Gun honor to Kasansky. Worried that he may have lost his nerve, Mitchell is given a chance to redeem himself during a tense international crisis involving a crippled US vessel and a flock of predatory enemy planes. Lieutenant Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is an expert United States Naval Aviator. When he encounters a pair of MiGs over the Persian Gulf, his wingman is clearly outflown and freaks. On almost no fuel, Maverick is able to talk him back down to the carrier. When his wingman turns in his wings, Maverick is moved up in the standings and sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School. There he fights the attitudes of the other pilots and an old story of his father's death in combat that killed others due to his father's error. Maverick struggles to be the best pilot, stepping on the toes of his other students.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The aircraft carrier Enterprise is on patrol near the Persian Gulf when radar contact is made with a MiG fighter. The Combat Air Patrol of the Enterprise is vectored to meet the incoming aircraft, and the fighters involved are F-14 Tomcat interceptors, each manned by a pilot and a Radar Intercept Officer. The pilot of the lead ship is Lt. Peter Mitchell (Tom Cruise), going by the call-sign Maverick, a call-sign appropriate for his arrogant rule-bending attitude; his RIO is Lt. Nicholas Bradshaw, call-signed Goose. Their wing-mate goes by the call-sign Couger with his RIO call-signed Merlin. The two F14s split up and are surprised when a second MiG, shielded from radar by riding within feet of its leader, appears. Couger is outmaneuvered by MiG One while Maverick locks his missile radar on MiG Two, who promptly disengages. MiG One stays on Couger and is only chased off when Maverick flies upside down, closes up on the MiG, and flashes an obscene gesture to the enemy pilot. The MiG disengages and the two Tomcats fly to the Enterprise, but Couger is so rattled he cannot land, forcing Maverick, low on fuel and against orders, to abort his own landing and talk Couger to the deck.Couger sees the captain of the Enterprise, known as Stinger, and turns in his wings. This forces Stinger to change his intended disciplinary action against Maverick, for he must send a Tomcat tandem for additional combat training at the Navy's Fighter Weapons School in Miramar, CA, near San Diego, and the Captain is disgusted that Maverick is the only qualified candidate for the assignment.Maverick, however, is quietly overjoyed as he regards the assignment as an opportunity, and upon arrival begins to build a rivalry with a fellow Tomcat pilot, Lt. Tom Kazansky, call-signed Iceman (Val Kilmer), and his RIO, call-signed Slider. At a bar the night after their first day at the School Maverick notices a pretty young blonde in jeans, and hits on her by following her into the ladies room. It seems not to work until the next day she appears at the School, for she is a DoD instructor on enemy aircraft, known as Charlie (Kelly McGillis). She begins to become smitten with Maverick before the official competition begins.In his first exercise Maverick takes on the School's resident ""enemy"" pilot, call-signed Jester, and succeeds in outmaneuvering him and ""shooting"" him down, but in so doing he flies below a set minimum engagement altitude - a hard-deck - and then compounds this faux Pax by overflying a flight tower at absurdly low altitude just to show himself off.
Iceman chews out Maverick for his ""unsafe"" attitude and Maverick refuses to have any of it, even after the School's leader, Commander Michael Metcalf - call-signed Viper - summons him to his office and threatens to expel him should he continue this way. Metcalf, however, knows Maverick, for Maverick's father flew with him in Vietnam and was shot down when he engaged the enemy in ""neutral"" airspace.The contest between Maverick and Iceman continues; in a later exercise Viper and Jester team up against Maverick and fellow F14 pilot Hollywood. Maverick breaks a cardinal rule by abandoning his wing-man to go after Viper, and in so doing Hollywood is ""shot down"" and then the same fate befalls Maverick.
But the worst is yet to come, for Maverick is teamed with Iceman and Maverick, determined to win the School contest, angrily chews out Iceman for taking too long to attack an enemy craft; Maverick takes the shot, but when the two aircraft get close, the backwash from Iceman's Thrusters cripple Maverick's engines and the F14 plunges toward the sea. Goose barely succeeds in yanking open the emergency ejection handles, but when the fighter's canopy pops open, the two pilots eject and Goose crashes into the canopy, killing him.Maverick is devastated by Goose's death and though an inquiry clears him of wrongdoing his confidence is destroyed. He nonetheless graduates from the class and is reassigned to the Enterprise, where an incident with enemy MiGs leads to a fateful battle involving Iceman as well as Maverick. Iceman and Hollywood are launched to intercept a pair of MiGs but are jumped by four additional enemy. Hollywood is shot down and Iceman hopelessly surrounded when Maverick is launched, now with Merlin as his RIO. Maverick quickly arrives at the scene of battle but is surrounded by enemy and when he flies into one ship's jet-wash his own fighter briefly stalls out - and though he regains control he flashes back to Goose's death and breaks off, leaving Iceman (who has long doubted Maverick's courage after Goose's death) trapped as Merlin desperately and furiously yells at Maverick to get back into battle.Maverick is haunted by memories of his dead father & the loss of Goose. He is unable to shake this off, but Viper talks to Maverick & suddenly Maverick begins to engage the enemy. He shoots down 4 enemy MIGs. The remaining MiGs abandon their chase of Iceman. Both land back on the Enterprise. Maverick is the hero."

Platoon,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Chris Taylor, a neophyte recruit in Vietnam, finds himself caught in a battle of wills between two sergeants, one good and the other evil. A shrewd examination of the brutality of war and the duality of man in conflict. Chris Taylor is a young, naive American who gives up college and volunteers for combat in Vietnam. Upon arrival, he quickly discovers that his presence is quite nonessential, and is considered insignificant to the other soldiers, as he has not fought for as long as the rest of them and felt the effects of combat. Chris has two non-commissioned officers, the ill-tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias Grodin. A line is drawn between the two NCOs and a number of men in the platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid. As the war continues, Chris himself draws towards psychological meltdown. And as he struggles for survival, he soon realizes he is fighting two battles, the conflict with the enemy and the conflict between the men within his platoon.—Jeremy Thomson Chris Taylor leaves his university studies to enlist in combat duty in Vietnam in 1967. Once he's on the ground in the middle of battle, his idealism fades. Infighting in his unit between Staff Sergeant Barnes, who believes nearby villagers are harboring Viet Cong soldiers, and Sergeant Elias, who has a more sympathetic view of the locals, ends up pitting the soldiers against each other as well as against the enemy.—Jwelch5742 A gritty and emotional look at the lives of a platoon of American soldiers as they patrol, fight and die in the jungles of Vietnam as seen through the perspective of a young recruit. Two veteran sergeants clash when one of them precipitates a massacre of villagers.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> Chris Taylor has arrived in Vietnam in the year 1967. Initially, he is mostly isolated from the rest of his platoon given that he is new to the unit. Over time, after witnessing combat and getting wounded, Taylor becomes more integrated into his unit. At the same time, tensions emerge following a massacre conducted by members of the platoon and Taylor finds himself caught in the crossfire.—Sam Freeman Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young American who has abandoned a privileged life at a university to enlist in the infantry, volunteering for combat duty in Vietnam. The year is September 1967. Upon arrival in Da Nang, South Vietnam, he sees dead soldiers of American soldiers in body bags being loaded into his plane. Taylor and the other recruits pass by a group of soldiers also departing on the plane who laugh at the ""new guys"", but more distressing to Taylor is the shell-shocked state of a departing soldier with the ""thousand-yard stare."" Taylor and several other replacements have been assigned to Bravo Company, 25th Infantry division, ""somewhere near the Cambodian border."" The platoon goes out on patrol in the trackless and inhospitable jungle dealing with mud, thick bushes, snakes and ants. Worn down by the exhausting work and living conditions of patrolling, Taylor's enthusiasm for the war wanes quickly and he develops an admiration for the more experienced soldiers, despite their reluctance to extend their friendship.One day, another new arrival, platoon commander Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses) discusses the plans for a patrol later that night with the platoon sergeants: the compassionate Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe), harsh but hard core Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), cowardly, sycophantic ""lifer"" Sergeant Red O'Neil (John C. McGinley), and drug addict Sergeant Warren (Tony Todd). Barnes and Elias argue over whether to send the new men out on a patrol that is likely to be ambushed. O'Neil insists that the new troops go out instead of several men under him who are nearly finished with their tours of duty. Barnes agrees, only on the condition that O'Neil goes out as well.That night, North Vietnamese soldiers set upon Taylor's sleeping unit. Gardner (Bob Orwig), a fellow new recruit, is killed, and another soldier, Tex (David Neidorf), is maimed. Despite having passed the watch duty to Junior (Reggie Johnson), a more experienced but consistently irresponsible soldier who fell asleep, Taylor is blamed for the casualties (O'Neil is also to blame, having thrown the grenade that maimed Tex). Immediately after the fighting, Taylor discovers a light wound to his neck, and he is sent to the field hospital for treatment.A few days later, Taylor returns to his unit from the hospital and, through a soldier named King (Keith David), gains acceptance from the ""heads"", a tight-knit group led by Elias that socializes, dances, and takes drugs in a private bunker. Next door in another bunker, Barnes leads the more traditional members of the unit whom drink beer, play cards and don't smoke opium. Taylor becomes a more seasoned soldier as the patrols continue and soon no longer stands out among the others.During one patrol on New Years Day, January 1, 1968, the platoon finds what appears to be an abandoned bunker. Elias explores a series of tunnels connected to the bunker. Two members of the platoon, Sandy (J. Adam Glover) and Sal (Richard Edson) are killed when they stumble upon a booby trap attached to a box of documents. Shortly after, a soldier named Manny Washington (Corkey Ford) goes missing. His mutilated body is found tied to a post close by. The platoon is infuriated by the senseless death of their comrade and are ordered to report to a nearby village of South Vietnamese citizens.The platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered. The other soldiers explore the village. In one house, Taylor discovers a mute and mentally challenged teenage boy and his mother hiding in a hole beneath the floor. Taylor harasses and taunts the retarded boy by shooting his rifle at his feet, but stops himself short of killing the boy. However, Bunny (Kevin Dillon) takes over and beats the boy to death with his gun, even though Sgt. O'Neil orders them to leave the hut. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man's wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man's young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is when Sergeant Elias arrives at the scene and starts a fistfight with Barnes. Lieutenant Wolfe, passive during the shooting of the wife, eventually ends the fight, and relays orders from his own superior officer to burn the village. As the men leave, a group of four soldiers, including Bunny and Junior, drag a young Vietnamese girl into the bushes with the intention of raping her. Taylor comes upon them and stops the group from raping the girl. His comrades ridicule him for stopping them.Upon returning to base, Elias reports Barnes' actions to Captain Harris (Dale Dye), who cannot afford to remove Barnes due to a lack of personnel. However, Harris threatens to court martial Barnes if there is evidence that he murdered an unarmed civilian. O'Neil and Bunny, nervous about the possibility of an investigation, speak to Barnes and Bunny suggests ""fragging"" Elias. A narrating Taylor speaks of this as ""a civil war in the platoon. Half with Elias, half with Barnes."" Taylor talks with Elias one night and Elias tells him that the United States is due for a loss in war because they'd been mostly successful in past wars. He also confesses that he's disillusioned with America's mission in Southeast Asia, that he used to believe it was winnable even a few years ago, but knows now that it's not.On their next patrol, the platoon is ambushed and pinned down in a firefight by unseen enemy soldiers. Flash (Basile Achara) is killed and Sergeant Warren and Private Lerner (Johnny Depp) are badly injured in the resulting skirmish. Lieutenant Wolfe calls in wrong coordinates for artillery support, resulting in the deaths of Fu Sheng (Steve Barredo), Morehouse (Kevin Eshelman), and Tubbs (Andrew B. Clark) and the severe wounding of Ace (Terry McIlvain). Big Harold (Forest Whitaker) has his leg blown off by a trip-wired booby trap while trying to escape the artillery barrage. Elias, with Taylor, Rhah (Francesco Quinn), and Crawford (Chris Pedersen), go to intercept flanking enemy troops. Though Lt. Wolfe is commanding officer, Barnes takes command. He orders the rest of the platoon to retreat to be airlifted from the area, and goes back into the jungle to find Elias' group. After sending Taylor, Rhah, and Crawford (who has been shot in the lung) back, Barnes finds Elias. The two stare at each other for a few moments and then Barnes fires three rounds into Elias' chest and leaves him for dead. Barnes runs into Taylor and tells him that Elias is dead and that he'd seen his body nearby. Barnes orders Taylor back to the landing zone. After they take off, the men see a severely wounded Elias emerge from the jungle, running from a large group of NVA soldiers. He dies after being shot several more times by the NVA while the American helicopters futilely attempt to provide him cover overhead. As they fly from the area, Chris takes a long look at Barnes' hardened face.At the base, Taylor tries to talk his dwindling group of six ""heads"" into killing Barnes in retaliation, claiming that when he'd met Barnes in the forest after shooting Elias, that the look on Barnes' face told him the truth. While King agrees, Doc Gomez (Paul Sanchez) believes they should wait for ""military justice"" to decide Barnes' fate. Rhah reminds Taylor how much he admired Barnes when he first arrived, and that Barnes isn't meant to die, noting that on several previous occasions Barnes has sustained wounds that ought to have proved mortal: ""the only thing that can kill Barnes, is Barnes."" Barnes then appears, very drunk with a bottle of bourbon, having overheard Taylor calling for his murder. He enters the room, daring them to kill him. No one takes up the offer but as Barnes leaves, Taylor attacks him. Barnes quickly gets the upper hand, pins Taylor down and holds a knife to his face. Rhah urges him not to do it, telling Barnes he'll be court-martialed and imprisoned, and he leaves after slashing Taylor under the eye.A few days later, the platoon is sent back to the ambush area in order to build and maintain heavy defensive positions against a potential attack. Rhah is promoted to Sergeant, commanding the remains of Elias' squad. The platoon is so severely weakened, though, that there are numerous gaps in their defense. When this fact is pointed out to him, Lt. Wolfe only replies that he doesn't ""give a fuck"" any more. The troops try to prepare for the incoming battle, during which they know the majority of them will die. Just hours before nightfall, King is allowed to go home as his tour of duty has come to an end. O'Neil tries to use Elias' R&R days for himself in order to escape the impending battle (in which he believes he will die). When he asks Barnes for permission, Barnes refuses, saying, ""Everybody gotta die some time, Red."" Junior tries to escape the battle by spraying mosquito repellent onto his feet and passing it off as trench foot, a ploy that Barnes recognizes right away. Bunny states that he feels no remorse for the murders he has committed, saying that he enjoys Vietnam, and goes on to proclaim himself to be ""Audie Murphy"", a famous and highly decorated World War II hero.Francis (Corey Glover), one of the last few remaining ""heads"", is assigned to the same foxhole as Taylor. That night a large attack occurs and the American defensive perimeter is broken and the camp overrun by hundreds of attacking North Vietnamese troops. Taylor and Francis take on and cut down several attacking enemy troops until they both pause when they hear signal whistles from the unseen NVA sergeants ordering their men to cease fire. Hearing a Vietnamese voice over a bullhorn and understanding that the NVA are ordering RPGs up to the line to blow up the foxhole they are in, Taylor grabs Francis and both of them crawl out of the foxhole seconds before it's hit by an RPG. Taylor and Francis then attack and kill several enemy soldiers that overrun their destroyed foxhole until Taylor loses it during the fight and charges off into the carnage, shooting one enemy soldier after another.Meanwhile, the NVA attack against the base continues relentlessly. The command bunker is destroyed by a NVA suicide bomber (Oliver Stone makes a cameo as the doomed battalion commander inside the bunker). During the massed North Vietnamese Army attack, many members of the platoon are killed, including Lt. Wolfe, Parker (Peter Hicks), Doc, Bunny, and Junior when their foxholes are overrun. The cowardly O'Neil survives only by hiding himself under a dead body. The desperate company commander, Captain Harris, orders the Air Force pilots to ""expend all remaining"" inside his perimeter. During the chaos, Barnes and Taylor come face-to-face. As a crazed Barnes is about to beat Taylor with a shovel, the two are knocked unconscious by the last-ditch American napalm attack.A wounded Taylor regains consciousness the next morning with a serious wound to his lower abdomen caused by Barnes striking him with the sharpened edge of the shovel earlier from the night before. Taylor soon finds Barnes, who is also wounded after being shot in both legs during the battle. Taylor takes an AK-47 rifle from a dead enemy soldier and aims it at Barnes, who lays helpless on the ground. Nonetheless, Barnes feels at first not threatened, and he dismissively orders Taylor to call a medic. When Taylor does not comply, but instead continues to aim his weapon, Barnes (deranged to the last) dares him to pull the trigger by saying: ""Do it!"" Taylor shoots Barnes three times in the chest, killing him. Taylor then drops his rifle, collapses, and awaits medical attention.Interestingly, although not in the script, Taylor is seen on the verge of pulling the pin of a grenade that he found, only to drop it as reinforcements reach him. (Charlie Sheen thought that Taylor would be committing suicide after killing Barnes. Oliver Stone thought that the mistake was good so he decided to keep it in the film.)Francis emerges from his foxhole and stabs himself in the thigh with a bayonet in order to be evacuated as a casualty. O'Neil is found by other Americans, and Harris (much to O'Neil's distress) gives him command of the platoon. As he is loaded onto the helicopter, Taylor is reminded by Francis that because they have been wounded twice, they can go home. Back at the bombed-out command post, hundreds of NVA bodies are being dumped into mass graves. After bidding farewell to Rhah, Francis, Tony Hoyt (Ivan Kane) and Ebenhoch (Mark Ebenhoch) (his last surviving friends in the platoon; the other survivors are Rodriguez (Chris Castillejo), Huffmeister (Robert Galotti), and O'Neil), Taylor boards his helicopter. The helicopter flies away and Taylor weeps as he stares down at the destruction, while he (from a future perspective) narrates that he will forever be in Vietnam, with Barnes and Elias battling for what Rhah called ""possession of his soul"", and that he believes he and other veterans must rebuild themselves, and find goodness and purpose in their lives."
The Karate Kid Part II,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091326/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Daniel accompanies his mentor, Mr. Miyagi, to Miyagi's childhood home in Okinawa. Miyagi visits his dying father and confronts his old rival, while Daniel falls in love and inadvertently makes a new rival of his own. Picks up where the first movie (Karate Kid) leaves off. Mr. Miyagi and Daniel take a trip to Okinawa to visit Mr Miyagi's dying father. After arriving Mr Miyagi finds he still has feelings for an old love. This stirs up trouble with an old rival that he originally left Okinawa to avoid. In the mean time Daniel encounters a new love and also makes some enemies.—K. Rose <rcs@texas.net> Resting on his laurels as an undisputed Karate Champion, Daniel LaRusso and his invaluable dear mentor, Mr Miyagi, return to the latter's hometown in humid Okinawa, after receiving an urgent letter about the sensei's gravely ill father. It's been already many years since the karate master left Japan; however, the need to tie up some loose ends of the past is as imperative as ever, as Miyagi's childhood friend and now an embittered sworn enemy, is still waiting for an opportunity to a lethal fight to the death. Obviously, almost half a lifetime isn't enough to leave the past behind--and to make matters worse--Sato's nephew, Chozen, thirsts to continue the feud by challenging Miyagi's love-smitten apprentice, Daniel, to a no-holds-barred match. But isn't love worth fighting for?—Nick Riganas This sequel to the 1984 surprise hit The Karate Kid reunites Ralph Macchio as high-school student Danny and Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita as Danny's martial-arts mentor, Miyagi. Picking up where the first film left off, The Karate Kid Part II finds Danny and Miyagi making an emergency trip to Okinawa, where Miyagi's father is dying. Here they revisit Miyagi's childhood sweetheart (Nobu McCarthy), who, Miyagi believes, had been wheedled into an arranged marriage with loose-cannon karate expert Sato (Danny Kamekona). Little does Miyagi realize that the woman is still single; Sato is still around as well, however, and intent on resuming the fight with his old nemesis. Morita agrees; meanwhile, Danny is challenged by Kamekona's pugnacious nephew (Yuji Okumoto). A male high school teenager and his martial arts mentor travel to Japan to visit family and experience the culture. While there, the male high school teenager learns more about martial arts, learn the culture, and meet some new friends while supporting his martial arts mentor.—RECB3 The opening of the story recaps events from the end of the previous film: Daniel LaRusso squares off against Johnny in the final match of the All-Valley Karate Tournament and wins the match and the tournament when he plants his mentor's, Mr. Miyagi's, signature move, a ""crane kick"" to Johnny's chin. Following the match, Daniel is showering and suggests to Miyagi that they perhaps go on tour to different karate championships. Miyagi kindly says that Daniel should consider ""early retirement"". Daniel humbly agrees.As they walk out to the parking lot, Daniel is congratulated by the tourney's announcer and referee on his win. Kreese, Johnny's sensei and owner of the Kobra Kai dojo, stalks past, pushing people angrily out of his way. He finds his students in the lot and berates Johnny for not winning the tourney. The scene turns ugly when Johnny talks back, telling his teacher that he's sick in the head. Kreese suddenly grabs Johnny in a headlock and backhands Jimmy, another of his students. Miyagi tells Daniel to wait by their truck and confronts Kreese, ordering him to let Johnny go. When he doesn't Miyagi frees Johnny himself. Kreese furiously tries to punch Miyagi, who easily dodges the blow. Kreese's fist breaks a car window. When he tries to hit Miyagi again, he breaks another car window when Miyagi sidesteps again. Miyagi forces Kreese to his knees and prepares to deliver a seemingly deadly strike to Kreese, growling Kreese' own words about showing an enemy no mercy. He gives a huge yell but stops short of landing the blow and instead honks Kreese's nose and drops him to the ground. Miyagi explains to Daniel that Kreese will have to live with the shame of being publicly humiliated, which is far worse than death.Six months later an angry Daniel arrives at Miyagi's house. The car that Miyagi gave him, a 1948 Ford Super De Luxe, is having mechanical trouble and Daniel, dressed in a tuxedo, is talking angrily about how badly his prom went: his girlfriend, Ali, had borrowed his car and had caused the mechanical trouble. Daniel also grouses about how Ali has found a new boyfriend. To make matters worse, Daniel tells Miyagi that his mother has accepted a temporary transfer to Fresno for the summer and Daniel will have to go with her. Miyagi quickly fixes Daniel's car and takes him to the back of his house where he seems to be constructing a new room. He persuades Daniel to calm down and focus with his breathing technique and shows Daniel how to drive nails with a single shot. Daniel soon feels better and asks Miyagi what the addition to the house is for. Miyagi tells Daniel that the room is for a ""refugee"" from Fresno -- he'd talked to Daniel's mother, who'd agreed to let Daniel stay in Los Angeles with Miyagi for the summer.A few minutes later, the mail carrier shows up and gives Miyagi an overseas letter. The letter is from Miyagi's former girlfriend in Okinawa -- Miyagi's father is dying. Miyagi has to travel to Okinawa to see his father before he dies. Miyagi also tells Daniel more of the story about his leaving Okinawa: he'd fallen in love with a young woman named Yukie who was betrothed to his best friend, Sato. Miyagi talks about how he was young and foolish and had told the entire village that he was going to marry Yukie despite her parents wishes. Sato, whose karate teacher was also Miyagi's father, challenged his friend to a duel to the death. Miyagi chose to leave rather than fight his best friend.When he's about to board his plane, Daniel suddenly shows up, having persuaded his mother to accompany Miyagi on the trip. Miyagi is reluctant and Daniel tells him he'd used his savings to buy the ticket. Miyagi agrees and they both fly to Okinawa. On the plane Daniel studies a book on Okinawan history and is strangely unable to locate Miyagi's village on the map.When they arrive they are met by a young man a few years older than Daniel, Chozen, who has a car waiting for them. Before Daniel gets in the car, Chozen shakes hands with Daniel, menacingly crushing Daniel's hand. Chozen and his driver take the two to a warehouse near the airport. They are met by Sato, who still holds a grudge against Miyagi and reminds him of his actions years ago. Miyagi refuses to fight Sato. Sato and Chozen leave Miyagi and Daniel to find their own way to town.In a taxi, they stop at the US Air Force base, which Miyagi remembers being the location of his village, called Tomi. An Air Force officer tells them that the village was moved years ago when the base expanded. Arriving at Tomi, Miyagi goes immediately to his father's house. He and Daniel are met by a young woman about Daniel's age, Kumiko, and Miyagi's former love, Yukie. Yukie is happy to see Miyagi and reveals that after Miyagi had left, she hadn't married Sato & hadn't ever married. Later, Miyagi's father requests that both his son and Sato see him. He joins their hands together, asking them to make peace between them right before he dies. Sato grants Miyagi three days to mourn and funeral his held.Miyagi takes Daniel on a tour of Tomi. They arrive at the fishing house where Miyagi used to work. Miyagi shares a story about how he was distracted when a large net of fish came in and he was almost impaled on the net hook. To demonstrate, he releases one of the hooks and swivels at the hips and knees, just barely avoiding being killed. Miyagi calls it the ""drum technique"", which is reminiscent of the ceremonial drum of the local villagers. Daniel asks to try himself and is forced to jump off the pedestal and falls into the water. Miyagi announces an end to the lesson, however Daniel tries again, releasing a hook on his own and successfully dodging it. Miyagi agrees with Daniel that it was a stupid thing to do.Meanwhile, Daniel has run afoul of Chozen, who is Sato's nephew and seems intent on harassing Miyagi in his uncle's name. Daniel catches Chozen cheating the villagers for food with fake scale weights. Chozen also seems jealous of Daniel's budding relationship with Kumiko, and harangues him often. When Kumiko sees Daniel practicing the ""drum"" technique he'd learned from Miyagi, she tells him it looks like an ancient Japanese dance called ""o-bon"". Chozen shows up, drunk, and teases Daniel. The confrontation turns violent and Chozen beats Daniel. While on a date with Kumiko, they go into a bar full of locals and American servicemen who, despite their obvious ignorance of martial arts, are trying to karate chop thick sheets of ice for money. None of them have made it through more than two sheets. Daniel explains to Kumiko what they're doing wrong and one of the Americans drops a challenge. Chozen suddenly appears offering 3-to-1 odds that Daniel can't break six sheets. Miyagi steps in, having been found nearby by Kumiko, and takes Chozen's wager. Sato is there too and covers Chozen's bet. At Miyagi's suggestion, Daniel meditates for a few moments and easily breaks all six sheets. Miyagi gives Daniel his share of the money. Later that night, Daniel goes with Kumiko to a 1950s sock hop. Chozen is there and begins to beat on Daniel and takes the money he'd lost back. Daniel hits Chozen in the crotch and gets his money back, retreating with Kumiko.Miyagi meets with Sato at Sato's house. There he finds Sato practicing on a large wood plank. Miyagi knows the plank is the same one they found on the beach as friends. Miyagi appeals to Sato, saying he still doesn't want to fight his old friend. Sato scoffs and walks away. Miyagi also reconciles with Yukie, saying he's sorry for leaving her. She tells him that she'd never married because of Miyagi's conflict with Sato. Daniel and Kumiko later see Miyagi and Yukie engaged in an ancient tea ceremony where they declare their love for each other.When Miyagi's three days of mourning have passed, Sato and Chozen show up at Miyagi's home. When they are unable to find Miyagi, Sato leaves, telling his nephew to ""leave a message"" for him. Daniel is awoken by their voices and goes downstairs to the courtyard and is immediately grabbed by Chozen's friends. Chozen threatens Daniel with a spear, using it to get him in a choke hold while his friends tear up the courtyard garden. Miyagi appears and orders Chozen to let Daniel go. Miyagi then engages all three boys in a short fight, defeating them all, including Chozen who tries to use the spear. Miyagi wrests it away and stops short of stabbing Chozen with it, eventually breaking it in half. He takes Daniel in the house while the boys leave, telling his student they'll leave tomorrow.The next day Sato has part of the local's gardens bulldozed. Miyagi confronts Sato again, telling him that he'll fight him on one condition: no matter who wins, the deed for the land the village sits on will be turned over to the residents forever. Sato scoffs but agrees when Miyagi tells him that it's a small price to pay.Miyagi later talks to Daniel, telling him he's willed the house in Los Angeles and all it's contents to Daniel should he die in the fight. Miyagi goes off to prepare. Daniel passes by a small chapel where he sees Sato meditating. As he walks past, he sees Kumiko sitting alone in another house. When he joins her, he sees that she's prepared a tea ceremony for them both. When the ritual is complete, the two of them kiss. Suddenly a tropical storm kicks up and they're forced to find shelter in an old concrete bunker left over from World War II. Miyagi is there already and he and Daniel see the chapel that Sato was meditating in suddenly collapse. They both run over to find Sato pinned under a thick beam. While Sato yells about Miyagi taking advantage of his helplessness, Miyagi strikes the beam, breaking it in half. They free Sato, who is thoroughly stunned at his quiet rival's sheer might, and take him to the shelter. Daniel breaks off from them to help the little girl who was on a small tower ringing the town's emergency bell. Daniel brings her down from her perch and struggles to reach the shelter. Sato orders Chozen to help Daniel, but he refuses, ashamed. Disgusted at his nephew's cowardice and impressed with Daniel's heroism, Sato runs out and helps Daniel out. When he makes it back to the shelter, he tells Chozen that he's dead to him. Chozen runs off into the storm.The next day, as the villagers are cleaning up, Sato joins them and hands the deed to the land over to Miyagi. At this, Sato bows and begs for forgiveness, which Miyagi answers that there is nothing to forgive. Daniel approaches him and asks if they can hold an o-bon at the ruins of an old temple near the ocean. Sato agrees. The dance is held that night. One of the events has Kumiko performing a traditional solo dance. Shortly after she begins, Chozen suddenly slides down on a lantern rope and grabs her, holding her hostage and challenging Daniel to fight him. Daniel accepts and crosses the small bridge, throwing it into the moat. The two fight, seemingly to a draw. Suddenly Miyagi and the other spectators begin using their small drums. Chozen is distracted and Daniel begins to hit him repeatedly, having learned the counter punch of the technique. Chozen is beaten and Daniel tweeks his nose in the same manner that Miyagi used on Kreese. The film ends with Miyagi smiling and Daniel holding Kumiko."
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092007/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"To save Earth from an alien probe, Admiral James T. Kirk and his fugitive crew go back in time to San Francisco in 1986 to retrieve the only beings who can communicate with it: humpback whales. The most acclaimed Star Trek adventure of all time with an important message. It is the 23rd century, and a mysterious alien probe is threatening Earth by evaporating the oceans and destroying the atmosphere. In their frantic attempt to save mankind, Admiral Kirk and his crew must time travel back to 1986 San Francisco where they find a world of punk, pizza and exact-change buses that are as alien to them as anything they have ever encountered in the far-off reaches of the galaxy. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy return as Kirk and Spock, along with the entire Star Trek crew.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> It is the 23rd century, and a space probe appears over Earth, emanating strange sounds towards the planet, and apparently waiting for something. As time goes on, the probe starts to cause major storms on Earth and threaten its destruction. Admiral James T. Kirk and crew are called upon once again to save mankind. They discover the strange sounds are actually the songs of the humpback whale - which has been hunted to extinction. They have only one choice - to attempt to time travel back into the 20th century, locate two whales, and bring them back to 23rd century Earth to respond to the probe.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> In 2286, an enormous cylindrical probe moves through space, sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling the power of ships it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. Starfleet Command sends out a planetary distress call and warns star ships not to approach Earth.On the planet Vulcan, the former officers of the USS Enterprise are living in exile, after the events of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. Accompanied by the Vulcan Spock, still recovering from his resurrection, the crew - except for Saavik, who remains on Vulcan - take their captured Klingon Bird of Prey vessel (renamed the Bounty, after the Royal Navy ship) and return to Earth to face trial for their actions.Hearing Starfleet's warning, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) determines that the probe's signal matches the song of extinct humpback whales, and that the object will continue to wreak havoc until its call is answered by the whales. The crew uses their ship to travel back in time via a slingshot maneuver around the Sun, planning to return with a whale to answer the alien signal.
Other officers include Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Medical officer, Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) engineer, helmsman Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols)Arriving in 1986, the crew finds their ship's power drained. Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its cloaking device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank to hold the whales they need for a return to the 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy output will enable their ship's power to be restored.Kirk and Spock discover a pair of whales in the care of Dr. Gillian Taylor (Catherine Hicks) at a Sausalito Museum and learn they will soon be released into the wild. Spock does a mind meld with a whale and figures out that it is preggers. Gillian is suspicious of Kirk and Spock, but Kirk manages to charm her and take her out to dinner. Kirk tells her of his mission and asks for the tracking frequency for the whales, but she refuses to cooperate.
Meanwhile, Scott, McCoy, and Sulu trade the formula of transparent aluminum for the materials needed for the whale tank.
Uhura and Chekov locate a nuclear-powered ship, the aircraft carrier Enterprise. They collect the power they need but are discovered on board. Uhura is beamed back but Chekov is captured and severely injured in an escape attempt.Taylor learns the whales have been released early and goes to Kirk for assistance. Taylor, Kirk, and McCoy rescue Chekov and return to the now recharged Bird of Prey. After transporting the whales aboard the ship, the crew returns with Taylor to their own time. On approaching Earth, the ship loses power and comes down in San Francisco Bay. Once released, the whales respond to the probe's signal, causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth and return to the depths of space.All charges against the Enterprise crew are dropped, save one for insubordination: for disobeying a superior officer, Kirk is demoted from Admiral and back the rank of Captain where he is returned to command of a star ship.
The crew departs on their ship, the newly christened USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A), and leaves on a new mission."
Back to School,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090685/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"To help his discouraged son get through college, a funloving and obnoxious rich businessman decides to enter the school as a student himself. Millionaire businessman Thornton Melon is upset when his son Jason announces that he is not sure about going to college. Thornton insists that college is the best thing he never had for himself, and to prove his point, he agrees to enroll in school along with his son. Thornton is a big hit on campus: always throwing the biggest parties, knowing all the right people, but is this the way to pass college?—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Fed up with the shenanigans of his obnoxious second wife, Vanessa, the self-made multi-millionaire clothing manufacturer, Thornton Melon, pays his college undergraduate son, Jason, a surprise visit. When Thornton discovers that his mixed-up son wants to drop out, he decides to go back to school, and enrols himself as a freshman, intent on earning the degree he never had. However, money can't buy everything, and before long, Thornton realizes that he may have bitten off more than he can chew. Has Thornton got what it takes to boost discouraged Jason's morale, and stay in college?—Nick Riganas Thorton Melon is a successful and wealthy businessman who owns a nationwide chain of clothing stores for overweight people. Melon himself came from humble beginnings where his father pushed him to succeed in school, however Melon himself, despite his sharp business skills, never attended college. At a meeting of his top staff, he accepts a few new investment ventures and suggests modifying a few more when his son, Jason, calls him. Jason is a student at a prestigious school, Grand Lakes University. His father asks him how he's doing with his studies, if he's enjoying being in a fraternity and if he's doing well as part of the diving team. Jason tells him all is fine but is actually lying to his father; he isn't in a frat and he's only the towel boy for the diving team.Melon's snooty, mean and spendthrift 2nd wife, Vanessa, holds a dinner party for her rich friends at their luxurious house. Thorton mentions that nearly all the people who attend are only there for free food and drink and want to schmooze her for donations. While he raids the fridge for a beer, he catches Vanessa in a tryst with another man, Giorgio. Thorton has known about the affair for some time and when Vanessa demands a divorce, he presents her with papers and shows her several Polaroids of her having sex with Giorgio.After the party, while he practices diving in his pool, Thorton talks to his personal aide and bodyguard, Lou, about how he's let Vanessa weaken his relationship with Jason. He decides he's going to make a surprise visit to Grand Lakes to see his son. When they arrive, Thorton goes to the wrong Greek house - it's a sorority house - and finds out that Jason isn't in a frat or on the diving team. Jason tells him that he's unhappy at the university because he hasn't made very many friends and the frats & diving team don't want him as a member. Thorton tells him that he needs to stay in college so he can be successful in life. He also tells Jason that he'll join him for a semester at the university, enrolling as a freshman.Thorton has no record of his academic achievement to qualify as a student so he persuades the school's academic dean, Dean Martin, by donating money to construct a new building that will house the Thorton Melon School of Business. The school's dean of the business department, Philip Barbay, is appalled that Thorton is able to bribe his way into Grand Lakes. Thorton counters by saying that he has real world business experience that trumps Barbay's academic credentials.Thorton and Jason register for classes and both take Barbay's business course. In the first class, Thorton counters nearly every point Barbay makes about his lesson plan for the semester where they will learn about theory by building a fictional company that will make and sell a product. Later, Thorton and Jason attend a literature class taught by Diane Turner whom Thorton embarrassingly falls for immediately. Though she's seeing Barbay, she seems to enjoy Thorton's freewheeling personality and dates him as well. When Thorton forgets that he's supposed to meet Jason for a study session, Jason instead meets with a young woman who he's smitten with, Valerie, and they bond, despite Valerie's attachment to a snobby student, Chas. Meanwhile, Thorton, while partying at a local bar, comes to the aid of Jason's roommate, Derek, a politically radical troublemaker who'd earlier disrupted a pep rally for the football team. The team's captain threatens to beat Derek when Thorton has Lou intervene, prompting a huge brawl. Thorton later comments that the football team isn't nearly as tough as his high school team was.Thorton also connects with the school's diving coach; the man knew Thorton when he was an entertainment diver on a pier in Atlantic City. The coach tells him that Jason tried out for the team but didn't do well. Thorton has Jason execute a difficult dive for the coach on the spot.
Thorton soon finds that he likes the fun aspects of college; hanging out in bars, throwing parties, schmoozing with female coeds, but he doesn't like the academic work involved. He brings in his senior staff and hires people from scientific corporations to do his classwork for him. Jason is angered when his father presents him with an astronomy paper that Jason wants to do himself. Jason becomes further disillusioned with his father when, after he makes the diving team, that his father might have persuaded the coach to let him join.One night during a wild party thrown by Thorton in the dorm room he had luxuriously renovated, Thorton is caught in the hot tub by Diane with several young women. His relationship with her is further hurt when she reads the paper he'd turned in on Kurt Vonnegut, saying that he couldn't possibly have written it himself and that the person who wrote it for him didn't know anything about Vonnegut. (Thorton had called in Vonnegut himself (who appears in a cameo) for assistance.)Barbay soon goes to Dean Martin with charges leveled against Thorton of academic fraud. Thorton lies and insists the work he did was his own but Barbay trumps his claim by suggesting that Thorton's final exams be given to him in oral format so he can't cheat. Thorton begins to pack, wanting to leave. Jason convinces him to stay and that he and his roommate, Derek, and Lou will all help him cram for his finals.When Thorton's big day arrives, he's exhausted. Barbay starts the proceedings, giving Thorton a grueling single question composed of 27 sections. Thorton persists and answers all the parts correctly. When he wants to give up, Diane asks him to recite Dylan Thomas' ""Do not go gentle into that good night"". Thorton gets a boost and finishes his exams.The Grand Lakes diving team has a match the same day. Jason does very well, earning high points while Thorton watches and waits for his exam results. When the team begins to fall behind their rivals, the diving coach calls Thorton poolside to execute his famous Triple Lindy dive from his Atlantic City days. Thorton is reluctant but Lou talks him into it. Thorton executes the dive, involving bouncing on several diving boards on 3 different levels of the platform and the team wins the match. Diane finds him after, telling him he earned all D's in his classes and one A from her.Thorton is allowed to give a humorous address to the graduating class. He tells them to stay in college and become successful, drawing laughter from the crowd."
Aliens,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Decades after surviving the Nostromo incident, Ellen Ripley is sent out to re-establish contact with a terraforming colony but finds herself battling the Alien Queen and her offspring. 57 years after Ellen Ripley had a close encounter with the reptilian alien creature from the first movie, she is called back, this time, to help a group of highly trained colonial marines fight off against the sinister extraterrestrials. But this time, the aliens have taken over a space colony on the moon LV-426. When the colonial marines are called upon to search the deserted space colony, they later find out that they are up against more than what they bargained for. Using specially modified machine guns and enough firepower, it's either fight or die as the space marines battle against the aliens. As the Marines do their best to defend themselves, Ripley must attempt to protect a young girl who is the sole survivor of the nearly wiped out space colony.—blazesnakes9 Living in a state of suspended animation for the past fifty-seven years, the sole survivor of the bloody Nostromo massacre inAlien (1979), Lieutenant First Class Ellen Ripley, wakes up in a salvage ship on its way back to Earth. Now, faced with the consequences of her actions, disgraced Ripley reluctantly accepts to escort the junior executive, Carter Burke, along with a tough-as-nails squad of U.S. Colonial Marines to Hadley's Hope, the terraforming and mining colony on LV-426, in exchange for her pilot's licence. But, there, on the dark surface of the remote exoplanetary satellite, multitudes of predatory endoparasitoid creatures known as Xenomorphs, just like the aggressive Stage 3 drone that killed Ellen's companions, prowl the area. This time, it's war, and as the undaunted, acid-spewing space-insects decimate the armed-to-the-teeth troops, once more, Ripley must take her life into her own hands. Can a woman alone put an end to the nightmare of the ferocious Aliens?—Nick Riganas InJames Cameron's superb sequel toAlien (1979),Sigourney Weaverreturns to civilization and is recruited to rescue a space colony on the planet where the first alien reigned. Only one small girl has survived--but a whole nest of 'them' is waiting for new prey. Hellbent on saving the child, Weaver takes on the alien leader, a female protecting her young, in a fight to the death. Fifty-seven years after surviving an apocalyptic attack aboard her space vessel by merciless space creatures, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) awakens from hyper-sleep and tries to warn anyone who will listen about the predators. Although she is ignored at first, when contact with colonists on a planet thought safe is suddenly lost, Ripley and a military team are sent to confront the aliens. After the opening credits, we see a spacecraft drifting slowly through space. Inside is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the only survivor from the previous movie, having escaped in the shuttle of the mining ship Nostromo, which she blew up after an aggressive and hostile alien species was responsible for killing her colleagues. Ripley is still in peaceful cryogenic sleep with the crew's pet cat, Jones, lying on top of her. A proximity alert goes off: the shuttle is intercepted by a salvage vessel. The crew, believing they'll be allowed to salvage an abandoned shuttle, uses a welding torch to open the door and enters, finding that Ripley is still alive.In Gateway Station, a space facility orbiting Earth, Ripley regains consciousness in a hospital. A nurse tells her she is in a medical bay. She is visited by Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), a representative of Weyland-Yutani (the Company from the previous movie, and Ripley's employer) who brings the cat Jones along. When Ripley states that she does not recognize the medical bay, Burke gives her some terrible news: she has been in hypersleep for 57 years, her spacecraft having drifted through space until the salvage vessel discovered it by very fortunate coincidence. Ripley shows clear distress and discomfort, when Jones starts hissing at her as she starts to convulse in the bed. Burke calls for medical attention, and the staff attempt to restrain Ripley. She pleads with them to kill her, before pulling her shirt up to reveal something pushing out of her stomach. Ripley suddenly wakes up bolt-upright in the hospital bed, clutching her chest, revealing the scene to be a nightmare. A nurse on the monitor next to her bed asks her if she needs something to help her sleep, but Ripley declines. The nurse was the one featured in her dream; the dream was a recollection from a real encounter with Burke, apart from the alien bursting out.Some time later, Ripley is sitting in an simulated environment waiting for Burke, who wants to prepare her for a board hearing. The Company has started a formal investigation into what happened with the Nostromo, and wants to question Ripley about her role in its destruction. Ripley is only interested in hearing news about her daughter Amanda. Burke hesitantly hands her a picture of an older woman and tells Ripley that her daughter has passed away from cancer while she was drifting through space. Devastated, Ripley whispers that she promised her daughter that she would be back for her 11th birthday before going off on the Nostromo.During the inquiry, Ripley desperately tries to convince the board of the dangerous nature of the Alien and the potential threat of the derelict ship, which still contains hundreds of eggs. She explains that Company policies at the time gave the Nostromo crew orders to obtain the creature, which killed the crew and caused the destruction of the ship. However, the board is extremely skeptical of Ripley's testimony. Because she admits to having destroyed the Nostromo and evidence of the Alien creature is lacking, they treat her as if she's mentally unstable. The board does not press criminal charges, but revokes her flight license and submits her to psychiatric supervision. Upon asking why no one will go to the planetoid to confirm her story, Ripley is shocked to learn that the planetoid, now known as LV-426, has already been colonized by terraformers for 30 years, who are creating an atmosphere to make the air breathable and the planetoid habitable.Some time thereafter, at the colony headquarters on LV-426, two Company employees discuss recently received Company orders to investigate a certain unsurveyed part of the surface of the planetoid. A surveyor is currently doing the job, wondering if he can make a claim to anything he finds. The higher-ranking man complains how they never got an answer to the question why those particular coordinates were so interesting, but assures him that anything found can be claimed. Outside on the barren and stormy planet surface, the aforementioned surveyor, together with his wife, son Timmy, and daughter Rebecca, whom is called ""Newt"" (Carrie Henn), discovers the same derelict ship previously found by Ripley's crew. He and his wife go in to investigate, but after a very long while, the wife comes back and calls for help on the radio: her husband is lying on the ground with a creature attached to his face (a facehugger like the one that attacked Kane in the previous movie).Released on her own recognizance, Ripley gets an apartment at Gateway Station. Some time later, she is visited by Burke, who is accompanied by Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope) of the Colonial Marines. Burke tells Ripley that contact with the colony on LV-426 has suddenly been lost. Fearing that Aliens are responsible, the Company intends to send a squadron of Marines; they would like her to serve as an adviser, as she has personal experience with this species. Burke will come along, as the Company co-financed the colony. Burke is aware that Ripley has taken a job on Gateway Station, running loaders and forklifts, work that is clearly beneath her. As a further incentive, Weyland-Yutani has agreed to reinstate Ripley as a warrant officer if she goes. Ripley refuses, as she dreads going back to the place where she first encountered the alien, and because she's still frustrated that nobody at the Company believed her earlier story. But as her nightmares continue, she feels that if she does not go on the mission, she will never find any peace. She calls Burke, and when he assures her that the mission to LV-426 is to eradicate any Aliens, not to study or capture them, she gives in. Jones will remain on the station.A massive warship, the Sulaco, travels through deep space. Inside are colonial marines led by Gorman, accompanied by Ripley and Burke. After awakening from hypersleep, seasoned veteran sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) quickly takes command. Ripley discovers that most of the marines are a wisecracking, undisciplined lot who joke around and do not seem to take the Alien threat seriously at all. One tough female marine named Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) refers to Ripley as ""Snow White"", and the marines seem to have a low opinion of their inexperienced ranking officer Gorman, who shows little interest in getting to know his squad members. Ripley is also dismayed to learn that a synthetic named Bishop (Lance Henriksen) is accompanying them on the mission as their science officer; she mistrusts synthetics ever since her altercations with Ash (from the previous movie). Bishop tries to assure her that the new generation of 'artificial persons' (as he calls it) all have behavioral inhibitors and are therefore incapable of hurting humans; however, Ripley angrily dismisses his attempts to befriend her.As the Sulaco approaches LV-426, Ripley tells the marines about her experiences with the Aliens (dubbed 'xenomorphs' by Gorman) during a mission briefing, but they are still rather undisciplined and scoff at the possible threat the creatures pose. During weapons detail, Ripley gradually begins to impress the soldiers, offering to help them load their dropship and displaying her expertise with the large power loader (a hydraulically enhanced suit). Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn) takes a special interest in Ripley, impressed with her strong personality and her way with people.Taking the dropship from the Sulaco to the planet, the marines have no problems with being dropped into the planet's atmosphere, but Gorman seems uncomfortable. He confesses that he has hardly any experience with these kind of missions, further undermining the opinion the marines have on him. One of the soldiers, Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) is loudly boasting his courage and the supreme firepower that they have at their disposal. The dropship clears the clouds and flies over the colony, which is a gigantic man-made structure, but without any visible activity. Burke explains that the facility contains an atmosphere processor designed to make planets suitable for human life, and that Weyland-Yutani manufactures them. The ship lands and deploys an armoured personal carrier (APC) with the marines inside before taking off again. The marines exit the APC and enter the main colony complex door. They sweep the building with motion trackers, but find the building deserted, save for a few laboratory mice left behind. The marines discover evidence of a fierce battle, including several barricades, hits from small arms and acid-burns on the ground, implying that there were casualties among the aliens as well. They conclude the building is safe for now, which Ripley doesn't believe. Gorman, Burke and Ripley enter the building, but Ripley is visibly affected by dark memories. In the medical lab, they finally happen upon evidence of Ripley's story: in a series of stasis tubes, they find several facehugger organisms, the spider-like creature that attaches itself to the face of a host. Two of them appear to be still alive. Bishop finds a file describing an attempt to remove a facehugger from one of its victims before it could implant an Alien embryo; the removal resulted in the death of the subject. Ripley and the others make an even more startling discovery: a little girl, about eleven years old, has survived the Alien assault on the colony. She runs away under the floor grating at the sight of the marines, but Ripley succeeds in winning her trust. Her name is Rebecca (she's the daughter of the surveyor family seen in the movie's beginning). Initially, the girl is non-communicative, seemingly in shock, but Ripley eventually gets through to her; she calls herself ""Newt"", and tells Ripley that her parents and the others are dead. Everyone has become a victim of the Aliens and she would feel safer if she could return to her hiding place in the ventilation system. Ripley assures her that she will be safer with herself and the marines.The cocky Private Hudson tracks the colonists by using homing devices embedded in their skin, and discovers that the entire population seems to be crowded underneath the primary heat exchangers of the facility. The team take the APC to the atmosphere processor, where Apone and the marines get out and Gorman and Burke remain aboard with Newt and Ripley to coordinate the sweep from a distance. While descending into the facility, the marines discover strange organic, hive-like structures that must have been secreted by the Aliens. Ripley realizes that the marines are walking next to the colony's nuclear reactor, and that their armor-piercing weapons could do serious damage to it that could cause it to explode. Gorman orders them to hand in their high-caliber ammunition; however, both Vasquez and Drake secretly reactivate their smart-guns, using spare connectors Vasquez had hidden in her equipment. As the team enters the basement, they find an Alien hive containing the dead bodies of the colonists, cocooned as hosts for the Alien facehugger parasites. One colonist is still alive, but she starts to convulse upon awakening, asking them to kill her. Suddenly, an infant alien (a chestburster) bursts its way out of her chest. The marines kill it with a flamethrower, but the sudden stir awakens the dormant warrior aliens, which are concealed inside the walls which offer them effective camouflage. They begin to attack, causing one marine to misfire her flamethrower, causing an explosion of an ammunition stash. The resulting disorientation proves disastrous, as the disoriented marines have no idea where the attackers are coming from, and are quickly reduced in their numbers. The marines start firing back at random, some with the restricted ammo, but the chaos and noise make it hard for anyone (especially Lt. Gorman and Sergeant Apone) to focus and organize a coordinated defense. Apone is suddenly attacked and incapacitated, causing an unprepared Gorman to panic. Angered and frantically shouting at Gorman for his lack of control, Ripley takes control over Gorman's protests, driving the APC all the way down the service ramps into the nest to rescue the surviving marines. Only four make it back to the APC, and one, Drake, is killed by acid from an exploding Alien shot by Vasquez. Ripley recovers Vasquez, Hicks and Hudson. Hicks manages to kill an Alien that tries to enter the APC with a shotgun blast (""Eat this!""), which results in a large acid burn on Hudson's arm. Gorman is knocked unconscious while Ripley drives the APC out of the facility, crushing an Alien under the wheels along the way and driving straight through a closed metal door. The escape destroys the APC's transaxle, rendering the vehicle largely immobile.On the planet's surface, in the APC, the survivors discover that several of their missing colleagues (Sarge and Dietrich) are still displaying lifesigns on the monitor. Ripley assures them nothing can be done, as they are being cocooned like the colonists to be hosts for more facehuggers and chestbursters. Vasquez recommends they nerve gas the area, but they opt against it, as there is no guarantee that the Aliens are even susceptible. Hudson loses his nerve, and expresses only cowardice and panic. Ripley suggests taking off and nuking the entire site from orbit, but Burke protests, as he is concerned about the dollar value of the facility. ""They can bill me,"" Ripley replies. Burke continues to protest, citing the importance of the Alien species, and claiming that no one has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them. Despite Ripley, Vasquez and Hudson protesting, he refuses to authorize the use of nukes. However, Ripley stipulates that it is a military operation now, and the ranking officer, Corporal Hicks, is now in command. Hicks seconds Ripley's motion of nuking the site from orbit over Burke's objections, and summons the pilots of the dropship. As Private Spunkmeyer re-enters the dropship, finding some slime before closing the ramp. An Alien that has slipped on board kills the pilot (Corporal Ferro) in mid-flight, and the ship crashes as the rest of the marines barely flee the crash site. Part of the dropship collides with the APC, destroying it and most of the team's weaponry.Ripley and the others are now stranded on the planet surface, with no means of returning to the Sulaco, and Hudson is starting to annoy the group with his incessant whining. Newt warns them that they should get back ""because it will be dark soon and they mostly come at night, mostly"". They retreat back into the main colony complex, where Bishop treats Gorman and the rest survey the limited remaining weapon arsenal they were able to salvage from the APC wreckage. The bad news is that there are only a few intact pulse rifles and flamethrowers left. However, amongst the salvaged items are four sentry guns, remote operated machine guns that can target objects automatically. Upon hearing that a rescue team can be expected no earlier than 17 days, Hudson starts panicking again, yelling that the aliens will infiltrate the complex again and kill them, but Ripley finally reprimands him, and points out that Newt has survived an even longer period without weapons and training. The survivors decide to fortify the barricades and seal off all possible access routes for the Aliens into the main colony complex. The plan is quickly brought into action and even Hudson shows some determination again. The sentry guns are placed at strategic locations where the aliens are expected to attempt and enter the building. A test shows that they function optimally.Hicks consolidates Ripley's trust by giving her a small locator to wear on her wrist, so he can find her anywhere inside the complex. Ripley puts Newt to bed and checks inside her doll head ""Casey"" for scary dreams. Newt explains to Ripley that Casey doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic. Newt wonders about what happened to her mother - especially if one of the Aliens came from inside her mother - but Ripley can't give her the answer. She tells Newt about her own daughter, who has also died. Newt is scared to go to sleep, so Ripley puts her locator on Newt and assures her she can find her anywhere in the complex now.Bishop has discovered that the Aliens' acid blood neutralizes after exposure to air. The group is discussing the Aliens, and their way of reproduction: humans are used as hosts for the facehuggers, which come from eggs; but who or what produces these eggs? Hudson proposes a large, dominant female, a queen, such as in a social insect colony. Ripley tells Bishop to destroy the two remaining facehuggers, but he tells her he got specific orders from Burke to keep them alive. Ripley confronts Burke about it; he wants the specimens taken back to Earth because the weapons industry will pay large amounts of money for them. He even tries to enlist her help in smuggling them past quarantine. Ripley refuses; moreover, she has checked the colony log and learned that Burke was responsible for sending the colonists to the derelict ship, after he learned about its existence from Ripley during her trial. Ripley blames Burke for not warning the colonists about the danger, but Burke maintains he simply wanted the colonist to accidentally find it, in order to lay a valid claim on the ship; he puts it aside as a bad call. A suddenly enraged Ripely grabs him by the lapels and angrily vows to expose his treachery when they return to Earth.As Ripley exits the room, the alarm sounds: the Aliens have arrived at the first set of sentry guns inside an access tunnel. The guns kill many of them, but they quickly run out of ammunition, as the Aliens' numbers are vastly superior. Bishop calls in. There is another problem: the nuclear reactor at the terraforming tower has started emergency venting. They learn that damage to the structure has caused it to malfunction; the cooling units have failed and the core will explode within four hours. Damage from the crash has made it impossible to shut down the reactor from their location. Remotely calling the second dropship from the Sulaco is also impossible, as the transmitter was on the APC and was wrecked in the crash. The only option is to go to the uplink tower and manually remote-pilot the Sulaco's second dropship to the surface. Hudson relapses into his desperation act again, refusing to go; however, Bishop unexpectedly offers to crawl through a small conduit to the uplink tower, as he is the only one qualified to pilot the ship anyway.The second set of sentry guns in the lower hallway empties its ammo into the hoard of Aliens. A great many creatures advance on the unmanned guns, but eventually they stop, not realizing that the guns have almost run out of ammunition. Apparently, the attempts to stop the Aliens' advance have temporarily succeeded. Hicks has Hudson and Vasquez check the perimeter. He promises Ripley he will not let her die by the Aliens, preferring to kill them both rather than falling victim to the creatures. He then gives her a crash course in how to use an M41A 10mm pulse rifle, with an over and under 30mm pump-action grenade launcher, and there appears to be a subtle attraction between them. On her way back to Newt, Ripley passes by Gorman, who has regained consciousness, and is clearly embarrassed by his earlier conduct. She returns to Newt and finds her curled up asleep, hiding underneath the bed. Instead of waking her, Ripley joins her underneath for a nap, laying her pulse rifle on the bed for safekeeping.Meanwhile, Bishop has crawled through the narrow conduit and reached the uplink tower, and is preparing the other dropship for departure. Ripley wakes up to find two empty stasis tubes on the floor: the two facehuggers have escaped. They are locked inside the lab and the pulse rifle has been taken. Ripley and Newt are attacked by a scurrying facehugger, but Ripley fends it off and tries to signal the marines through a surveillance camera; however, as Bishop keeps updating Hicks and his crew about the drop ship, Burke slyly turns off the monitor to prevent the others from seeing Ripley's cry for help. Ripley manages to trigger the fire alarm with her cigarette lighter, but this also draws out the facehuggers; Hicks, Hudson, Gorman and Vasquez arrive just as a facehugger attempts to attach itself to Ripley's face, and the second one threatens Newt. The facehugger threatening Newt is killed immediately by Hudson; Hicks and Gorman get the second facehugger off Ripley and throw it into a corner, where Vasquez kills it with a pulse-rifle as it tries to attack again.In the Operations room, Ripley knows it must have been Burke who was acting in retaliation to her promise to expose him; she suggests that Burke intended to impregnate her and Newt with the facehuggers, then sabotage the other marines' cryotubes so as to eliminate any witnesses. He would emerge back at Earth as the only survivor, and smuggle the Aliens in the bodies of Ripley and Newt. Burke denies Ripley's allegations, but the other marines are quickly convinced by Ripley's story. As they debate what they should do with Burke and are about to waste him, the power to the facility is suddenly cut off. Hicks has Vasquez and Hudson walk perimeter. They use motion trackers and register movement coming towards them, already inside the perimeter, and Hudson reports ""there's movement all over the place"".Everyone pulls back in the central Operations room, but the signal keeps approaching, even inside the barricades. They suddenly realize that they have blocked the direct access routes, but forgotten the less obvious ways in; Ripley looks up and Hicks opens a ceiling panel, and sees that an army of Aliens has simply circumvented the barricades by climbing upside-down through the crawlspaces over the ceiling. They open fire, and hoards of Aliens break through the ceiling. As the remaining marines take on the creatures, Burke slips away and prevents the rest from escaping by sealing the med lab door. Hudson puts up a brave fight, gunning down several Aliens, but he is ambushed by several Aliens coming up from the floor grid, who grab and pull him down out of sight. Burke is killed by an Alien that has already found a way inside the med-lab.Newt finds an alternate escape through the air ducts. Bishop reports that the ship is on it's way, E.T.A. 16 minutes. Inside the vent, Vasquez is last and fires all her grenades and pulse rifle ammunition, and draws her handgun, then is attacked by an Alien coming down through a vertical duct. She empties her handgun into it and kills it but the spilling acidic blood of the creature seriously wounds her leg. Gorman comes to help her, but they suddenly find themselves surrounded by Aliens. Once Gorman's handgun is also empty, he triggers a grenade, killing himself and Vasquez and destroying Aliens around them.The explosion causes Newt to fall through a ventilation shaft that leads to the bottom of the facility. Ripley and Hicks take the stairs to the basement, following the tracker signal. They find Newt, still clutching her doll's head, in a sewer below a grid, which Hicks tries to cut open, but Newt is snatched by an Alien before they can rescue her. Ripley screams in desperation when she sees the doll's head floating in the water, but remains determined to rescue Newt, knowing the Aliens will cocoon her to await a facehugger. Ripley and Hicks rush into an elevator to go up. The doors don't close until they pound on the buttons a second time, and an Alien jumps in before the doors close. Hicks kills the creature, but is severely wounded by the Alien's spilling blood, which quickly eats through his body armor. Ripley drags Hicks out through the complex main doors and they meet up on the surface with Bishop, who has just piloted the rescue ship to the surface by remote. However, Ripley refuses to leave the planet and demands that Bishop take her back to the atmosphere processor to rescue Newt.Bishop reluctantly flies the dropship into the atmosphere processor, which is now beginning to overload, and lands on a high platform. Ripley arms herself with a pulse rifle, a flamethrower, and the locator duct-taped together, plus M40 grenades and M-94 marking flares, ignoring Bishop's warnings that the explosion will occur in 19 minutes, leaving a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska. She says goodbye to the wounded Hicks, who, as a sign of trust, tells her his name is Dwayne; Ripley tells him her name is Ellen. She tells Hicks, who has been treating his injuries, not to let Bishop leave, and he confirms that they ain't goin' anywhere.Ripley takes an elevator down, loads the grenade launcher, and stuffs some flares in her pocket. An announcement declares that there are now 14 minutes remaining to reach minimum safe distance. She stalks through the basement, blasting her flamethrower, and leaves signal flares on the floor for backtracking as she infiltrates the Alien hive. She uses the locator signal to find Newt, but only finds the detached wristpiece. She collapses to the floor, stricken with grief, but hears Newt scream: the girl has been cocooned and is threatened by a facehugger hatching from an egg. Ripley kills the creature, which alerts warrior Aliens to her presence. The attacking warriors are quickly gunned down by Ripley and she frees Newt from the cocoon-wall. Several explosions from the failing reactor drive Ripley, carrying Newt, into a chamber full of eggs. It also houses a monstrously large Alien: the Queen of the hive, still laying eggs. Several warrior Aliens close in on them, but when Ripley threatens to destroy the eggs, the Queen signals them to retreat. Ripley and Newt slowly back out of the egg chamber, planning to leave the Queen and eggs to be destroyed in the imminent nuclear explosion, but when an egg hatches next to Ripley, she can stand it no longer. She turns the flamethrower on the eggs, spraying the room with napalm. The Queen goes mad, screeching insanely at the destruction of her offspring. Ripley then fires a series of bullets and grenades into the eggs, several warrior Aliens and the Queen's egg-sac, blowing it to bits. As she and Newt retreat out of the chamber, a warrior Alien ambushes them, but it is quickly gunned down. Ripley throws her grenade belt into the raging inferno, and then retreats towards the elevator. The exploding grenades destroy the remaining eggs, but also dislodge the Queen Alien from her perch. The queen tears herself free from the egg-sac and furiously pursues Ripley and Newt, who make it back to the elevator, then have to wait for it to return. There are four minutes remaining to reach minimum safe distance.As they retreat into the elevator they are approached by the Queen, and Ripley uses the remaining napalm in the flamethrower on the Queen, burning her severely as the elevator carries them up. However, the second elevator opens up in front of the Queen, who tilts her head while looking at it. As they arrive on the platform with two minutes remaining, to Ripley's desperation, the dropship is not there. She curses Bishop. Ripley's ammunition counter reads zero. While the surrounding complex is quickly exploding and collapsing, the other elevator arrives, its door opens, and the Queen emerges. Ripley tells Newt to close here eyes, possibly intending to leap to their deaths rather than let the Queen kill them. Just then the dropship comes hovering over the platform. Ripley and Newt are narrowly able to get on safely and on time. The dropship carrying Ripley, Newt, Bishop and Hicks barely escapes as the processing facility explodes in a massive mushroom cloud below them.Back on the Sulaco, Bishop says he had to sedate Hicks for the pain, but that he would be all right. He explains that he had to take off from the platform, which became unstable, and had to circle while waiting to pick them up. Ripley makes peace with Bishop, thanking him for saving their lives. Suddenly, Bishop is speared from behind by a huge stinger, and ripped in half at the waist by the Queen: she had stowed away by hiding inside the recess for the landing gear. She advances menacingly towards Ripley and Newt. Ripley attracts the Queen's attention and tells Newt to run. Newt dives under the flooring as Ripley continues to call the Queen, then runs and quickly closes a door behind her.The Queen batters the door, then searches the floor and starts ripping the floor plates up until she has the child cornered. Newt screams like a high-pitched siren. Suddenly, Ripley appears, inside the large forklift power loader she used earlier. The exoskeleton-like machine makes her an even match for the giant Queen, and they battle furiously. Ripley punches the Queen several times, grabs her and attempts to dump her into the ship's airlock, but the Queen quickly grabs hold of the power loader, and Ripley gets dragged down into the airlock with her. Ripley manages to get out and climb up the ladder, as the Queen grabs her leg. Ripley activates the controls, opening the outer lock door, causing air to rush out of the ship. Bishop is in bad shape but his head and upper torso are still functioning, white hydraulic fluid everywhere, and as what's left of him slides towards the airlock he grabs on to the floor grill to hold himself in place. The Queen desperately tries to hold onto Ripley's foot, but her shoe comes off and the Queen is blown out into space, screaming and flailing madly. As Newt is also being blown towards the airlock, Bishop grabs her and anchors them both in place. Ripley somehow manages to pull herself up out of the airlock against the enormous air pressure, and closes the airlock, barely pulling her leg out in time. Newt comes up to her and hugs her, calling her ""mommy"". Bishop congratulates her: ""Not bad for a human"", as Ripley and Newt hug.The film ends as Ripley prepares Newt, Hicks, and what's left of Bishop for hypersleep for the journey back to Earth. She assures Newt she can sleep all the way home, and that they both can dream. They are both in deep sleep as the ending credits roll. After the ending credits, the sound of the howling wind and a scurrying facehugger are heard."

But unfortunately for Sam, the kidnappers are sweet-natured Ken (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy Kessler (Helen Slater), who are neither particularly inclined to resort to murder nor fully prepared for Barbara's volatile, spoiled nature. So Sam must juggle the police, who are growing increasingly suspicious of Sam himself, and his own mistress Carol Dodsworth (Anita Morris), who has her own plans to get her hands on Sam's fortune. Meanwhile, Barbara herself warms toward her captors and wonders why Sam's taking so long to organize the ransom.—Scotty Slime ball businessman Sam Stone (Danny DeVito) plots to murder his horrible wife (Bette Midler) for her money, so he can marry his mistress Carol Dodsworth (Anita Morris).

Sam is greedy and grasping. He reveals to Carol that 15 years earlier, he only married Barbara for her money but her father (who was also his boss) took a long time dying. Sam thus built up a small fortune of his own but Barbara is the heiress to a much larger one of over $15 million. Furthermore he hates her choice in clothes and ""modern"" furniture and several of her personal quirks.However, when Sam arrives home at his and Barbara's fancy house in Bel Air, he finds the house empty. In frustration he tosses away the bottle of chloroform he intended to use to put Barbara to sleep before killing her. He then receives a phone call from an anonymous man announcing that Barbara has been kidnapped and that Sam must pay a large ransom of $500,000 or else she will be killed. She will also be killed if he informs the cops or the media. (""or else"" is exactly what Sam has in mind). Before long, the house is swarming with police looking for clues to the kidnapping which is now headline news!!!The kidnappers are revealed to be Ken (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy Kessler (Helen Slater), a married couple who live in a lower class area of the San Fernando Valley and whom are both desperately poor and eager for revenge against Sam. Apparently several years earlier, Sam ""made his fortune"" by stealing a fashion idea from Sandy, along with the Kesslers' life savings to market it. Barbara, Sam's overweight, loud-mouthed wife, is chained in the Kessler's basement, where she proves a handful to the amateur kidnappers. She never stops yelling, cursing, or screaming at the Kesslers. Ken slapping Barbara in the face to subdue her only makes her more angry and aggressive like some wild caged animal that will not calm down. (At this point, it's no wonder why Sam wants Barbara dead.)Things go astray, however, when it becomes obvious that Sam doesn't want his wife back, and is in fact doing everything possible to goad the kidnappers into killing her. Unfortunately for him, the Kesslers, while desperate, are not about to murder anyone.The next day when Sam does not show up for the ransom drop, Ken phones him and offers to drop the ransom first from $500,000 to $50,000, then the following day to $10,000. Sam still refuses.Sam is unaware that the Kesslers are behind his wife's abduction (Sam has apparently forgotten about the Kesslers... as well as all of the other people he's scammed and ripped off over the years). But Sam is also unaware about his mistress Carol's real intentions towards him. Carol is actually a gold-digging grifter in which she and her handsome but moronic boyfriend, Earl (Bill Pullman) are planning to steal all of Sam's wealth for themselves. Believing that Sam made up about his wife's kidnapping to the public, Carol believes that Sam plans to toss his wife's dead body from the Hollywood hills at night, Carol has Earl lie in wait with a video camera. What he actually ends up filming is a rendezvous in a car between a prostitute and her john, who asks her to ""make a lot of sound."" The dim-witted Earl, hearing the woman's screams, mistakenly thinks the murder is happening right in front of him.Without watching the tape, Carol sends an anonymous copy to Sam, who sees the sex act captured and immediately hits on Carol as the one who sent it and announces that he is looking forward to repeating the scene with her. Terrified, she hides out with Earl at his trailer and sends another anonymous copy to police chief Henry Benton (William G. Schilling).... who happens to be the john in the video. When Carol calls him, Benton, thinking that he is being blackmailed, asks her what she wants and she says the answer should be obvious: arrest Sam Stone.The next day, Benton orders the police to conduct a search of Sam's house, planning to plant evidence in it, but he is surprised when real evidence turns up which includes the bottle of chloroform and pictures of Sam with Carol. The kidnapping investigation, led by the stuffy detectives Bender and Walters, which has actually led to Ken himself by now, is immediately called off (just when they begin to close in on the Kesslers) and Sam is arrested. The chloroform was part of Sam's plan to kill Barbara himself but he never did and now faces the dilemma of having to get his wife back in order to prove his innocence.A third complication arises when Barbara reluctantly decides to take up exercise to relieve her boredom in her cell. To her own astonishment, she loses twenty pounds in one week during her confinement. She and Sandy bond unexpectedly over this and Sandy shares several of her fashion designs with Barbara, who loves them and offers to take them worldwide. In their euphoria, Sandy decides to let Barbara go. Barbara leaves, but comes back as soon as she finds out from the newspaper about Sam's mistress which leads her to realize that he wanted her dead. Just as Barbara comes back, a serial killer, known as the Bedroom Killer (J.E. Freeman), who has been stalking the neighborhood enters the Kessler household and attacks Ken, but falls down the basement steps, breaking his neck and dying in the process.Barbara, Ken, and Sandy now hatch a plan for revenge on Sam. Now desperate to prove his wife is alive, Sam offers to pay the ransom the moment Ken calls him again. But now, armed with Barbara's inside knowledge, they have increased the ransom to precisely equal Sam's own net worth: over $2 million. Sam is outraged, but has no choice. He withdraws the cash, but begs detectives Bender and Walters to watch the drop site. They refuse, still thinking he murdered Barbara.Meanwhile, Carol, baffled as to why Sam hasn't been convicted already, goes to a video store and plays the tape in the display model. But the scene of the whore and the client is played on every TV in the shop and Chief Benton's wife, who happens to be there, recognizes her husband.When Sam goes to the bank to obtain as much of the money as possible, Benton can be seen withdrawing his own cash and with a passport, presumably in order to flee abroad.Carol realizes Earl's mistake, and that Barbara really was kidnapped. She calls Sam and learns the time and place of the ransom drop. She tells Earl to go to the place and steal the ransom money.The next day at the ransom drop to be at a local plaza in downtown Los Angeles, Sam waits with the cash (which was all from his account.) Barbara calls Sam from an office across the street instructing him to wait while yelling curses and obsanities at him claiming that the kidnappers are making her do it. She also demands that Sam also deposit his expensive gold Rolex wristwatch and a gold ring to make sure that he does not have any assets left to live on. Sam is forced to comply and she tells him that someone will arrive to pick up the money. The minute after Barbara hangs up, Ken arrives in disguise, wearing a crude clown mask and driving the serial killer's car, to demand that Sam hand over the briefcase with the case. But just when Sam does, scores of hidden police, led by Bender and Walters, arrive. Ken prevents himself from being arrested by claiming to have Barbara killed by his accomplice over a CB radio. Against Sam's protest, the police decide to let Ken go and instead ""follow him home"". But just then, Earl arrives with a gun to steal the ransom money from Ken. In the ensuing confusion, Earl is captured by the police, and Ken drives away in the Bedroom Killer's car, while a whole group of police cars silently follow him.Ken sees the police following him and drives his car off the end of the Santa Monica pier with the ransom cash inside. Money starts rising to the surface and people on the pier jump in to grab it. Sam yells at the police officer nearest him to stop them and pushes him in too. The police search the water and bring up the car, with the body of the serial killer inside... dressed in Ken's clothes.Sam fakes grief, but is ecstatic inside, believing that Barbara will now definitely be killed and her money is his at last. Instead, Barbara appears, telling Bender and Walters that her kidnapper (the serial killer) was insane, believing himself to have accomplices, and so she was able to escape as soon as he left. Bender and Walters walk away in satisfaction and the case is closed with Sam cleared of all criminal charges. Sam meanwhile is taken aback by how beautiful Barbara has suddenly become. As they embrace (out of eyesight of the departing police) she gives him a sound thrashing for his affair and in addition for not even trying to pay the ransom to save her, tells him that she wants a divorce and pushes him off the pier and into the water. Sam presumably swims ashore and although free and clear, is now without his money... and without his mistress Carol (whom no doubt the arrested Earl will rat out to save himself from going to jail).In the final scene, on a beach not far away, Ken emerges from the water in scuba gear, carrying the briefcase with the ransom cash. Apparently Ken hid the dead body of the serial killer in the car, and planned the switch to get away from the police. Sandy runs to meet him and embraces him lovingly and kisses him. Barbara appears, having disposed of her husband, and runs to meet Sandy and Ken and they all dance for joy on the beach with the briefcase containing the $2 million."

After calming Cameron down, Ferris comes up with a plan to run the car in reverse, in place, with its rear wheels jacked up, at Cameron's father's hillside garage, hoping to reverse the odometer.

Cameron calms down and rests himself against the car, but his previous actions have unbalanced it from the jack it was on, the car hits the ground, races in reverse, and crashes through a glass wall, landing in a ravine.

However, Jeanie, apparently having come to appreciate her brother's craftiness, has beaten him home despite her mother's demands and getting a ticket for speeding. She pretends to scold Ferris for trying to walk home from the hospital while he is so ill, and thanks Mr. Rooney for driving him home, making sure to show Mr. Rooney the wallet he left behind when he broke in earlier. Rooney is once again chased by the dog. Ferris races to his room and makes it into bed just as his parents check on him. After they leave, he breaks the fourth wall and imparts some wisdom to his audience: ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.""As the credits roll, Mr. Rooney in his disheveled state is forced to catch a ride back to school on a school bus. In the tag at the very end of the credits, Ferris emerges from the bathroom, pleading to the audience directly, ""You're still here? It's over! Go home! Go!"" before he turns around and reenters the bathroom."

As they travel together, Fast Eddy realizes how much he had lost, and can see the inevitable finale of their relationship as history begins to repeat itself. In an effort to avert tragedy, Eddy severs their relationship, and returns to his first love, pool. Finally, in a big Atlantic City tournament, Cruise returns the favor, and teaches Eddy the final lesson that allows him to finish his quest of re-discovery.—Anonymous The Hustler is back, or is he?Setting his eyes on Vincent (Tom Cruise), a young and talented, but quirky and obnoxious, pool player, rekindles Fast Eddie Felson's (Paul Newman) passion for pool. Vincent has a valuable attribute in Eddie's eyes - anonymity. Eddie is well-known and, consequently, incapable of success as a road warrior in the seedy world of action pool, but in Vincent, he sees a meal ticket, and takes him under his wing. Unfortunately, Vincent needs some schooling, not in playing pool, but in the art of baiting, taunting, and deceiving potential opponents and side bettors to trap them. Vincent has a hard time adapting to Eddie's methods, clearly troubled by the inherent immorality, and it doesn't appear that Eddie's lessons will ever sink in. At his weakest, Vincent is incapable of holding back in a gambling session with America's best big action player, Grady Seasons (Keith McCready). Eddie's lessons will surely sink in at some point. Or will they?Eddie gives Vincent some money to go on the road, and Vincent, at long last transforming himself into the hustler Eddie had always wanted him to be, makes a lot of money. Shortly after, Vincent and Eddie enter the same pool tournament in Atlantic City, but the action is hottest in the practice room. It is at this tournament where Eddie does some soul searching, and when he, surprisingly, turns down a shot at having a piece of Vincent's practice room gambling action, it is the onset of his rejection of pool's seedier side. In Vincent, Eddie sees some of himself, and what he sees repulses him. Eddie now wants to win on merit, rather than through a hustle, and his passion for winning fair and square shows in his exuberance in his tournament matches.All of a sudden, he is the Eddie that beat Minnesota Fats through excellence, rather than the Eddie who had successfully hustled many, and his self-esteem seems to be peaking just when he learns that Vincent dumped their tournament match to turn a large profit in side betting, a clear blow to Eddie's pride. From Eddie's vantage point, dumping has gone from being an undeniable aspect of betting on pool to an objectionable practice. The Vincent he knew had refused to dump or deceive, but now, dumping and deception are art forms that Vincent and his girlfriend and new manager (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) have mastered. Suddenly, the tournament no longer represents Eddie's best chance to regain his self-esteem. Why, one must wonder, is Eddie practicing immeidately after he forfeits his very next match in the tournament?Because he is preparing for the only match out there that matters to him......the one against Vincent.....and his resolve to play and win that match is his new raison d'etre."
Stand by Me,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092005/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the death of one of his friends, a writer recounts a childhood journey with his friends to find the body of a missing boy. It's the summer of 1959 in Castlerock, Oregon and four 12 year-old boys - Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern - are fast friends. After learning of the general location of the body of a local boy who has been missing for several days, they set off into the woods to see it. Along the way, they learn about themselves, the meaning of friendship and the need to stand up for what is right.—garykmcd Shocked by the death of a dear friend, thirty-something writer Gordie Lachance takes a trip down memory lane. And as he reminisces about the hot summer of 1959 in Castle Rock, Oregon, a life-changing adventure comes to life. Back then, Gordie and his three close friends wanted to be the town's heroes by finding the body of a missing 12-year-old boy. Instead, the kids had to compete with local tough Ace Merrill and his bullies. Growing up is a challenge. But finding real friends can be even more challenging. Wouldn't life be simpler if you stood by me?—Nick Riganas In a treehouse at the edge of Castle Rock, a small Oregon town, budding 12-year-old writer Gordie is about to begin an extraordinary trek into the heart of the northwestern forest. His best friend Vern has overheard his older brother and a friend talking about their discovery of a dead body in the woods. Hoping they can get credit for finding the body, Gordie sets off with insecure, frightened Vern, tough guy Chris and daredevil Teddy on an adventure that becomes an odyssey of self-discovery. Gordie Lachance, a writer, looks back on his preteen days when he and three close friends went on their own adventure to find the body of a kid their age who had gone missing and presumed dead. The stakes are upped when the bad kids in town are closely tailing - and it becomes a race to see who'll be able to recover the body first.—Dismal Angel A man (Richard Dreyfuss) sits in his car reading the headline of a newspaper article about a man who had been stabbed to death at a fast food restaurant. He is overcome with a wave of nostalgia and begins to narrate the story of when he was 12 years old and the time he first saw a dead human being.Gordon ""Gordie"" Lachance (Wil Wheaton) is playing cards inside a tree house with his best friends Chris Chambers (River Phoenix) and Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman). Each boy has his own story and a reputation to follow. Chris comes from a family renowned for their dishonesty and abusive nature, which gives him a bad rap despite his tough but kind disposition. Teddy, rather eccentric, is recognizable by the mangled remains of his right ear which his mentally unstable father held down to a hot stove top. His father resides in a mental institution but Teddy speaks highly of him for serving in WWII. The fourth of their group and the butt of many jokes, portly Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), begs to be let in the tree house, saying he has important news. The others make light fun of him until he asks if they want to go see a dead body. They all fall silent as he explains that, while looking for a misplaced penny jar under his porch, he overheard his older brother Billy (Casey Siemaszko) and friend Charlie Hogan (Gary Riley) discuss how Billy found the body of Ray Brower, a kid who had recently gone missing. Gordie and his friends followed the story closely because Ray was around their age, last seen picking blueberries in the woods outside of town. Billy says the kid must have been hit by a train and refuses to report the discovery to the police because he was at the site in a stolen car.Gordie and the others decide to go find the body and accept recognition as local heroes. They make plans to tell their parents they're sleeping over at each other's homes the next day and to meet the next morning on the train tracks leading out of town. Come morning, Gordie goes to fetch his canteen in his older brother's room. A few months prior his brother, Denny (John Cusack), a popular athlete, died in a car accident. Gordie's mother (Frances Lee McCain) has been silent and distant since then and his father (Marshall Bell) asks him why he can't have friends like Denny's or play sports like him. He has no interest in his son's aspirations to become a writer and criticizes Chris for stealing milk money at school. The only support Gordie received was from his brother who gave him an old Yankee cap, something he now cherishes.Gordie meets Chris in town who takes him to a back alley and shows him the gun he swiped from his father's bureau. Gordie lightly takes aim at a garbage can and pulls the trigger, thinking it's not loaded. It is. It fires and sends the two running for the main street where they come across a few members of a gang led by Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland). Chris's older brother, Eyeball (Bradley Gregg) leers at the boys as Ace steals Gordie's cap and threatens Chris with a lit cigarette. They let the boys go unharmed and walk away, laughing. Gordie and Chris meet up with Teddy and Vern at the train tracks where they realize no one's brought food. They take out their money and agree to buy something along the way. As a train approaches, everyone but Teddy gets off the tracks. Teddy imitates shooting an automatic at the train, intent on dodging it at the last second, 'just like my father in Normandy'. Chris, however, pulls him off before the stunt can be performed and yells at him for nearly killing himself.They soon arrive at a local junkyard that is rumored to house a disgruntled owner with a ferocious dog named Chopper which he's supposedly trained to attack any intruders, going right for the person's balls. However, the yard is empty and the four rest in the shade of a car hood for a few minutes while Gordie, after losing a race, goes to retrieve food at the store on the other side. On his way back, he notices the others scrambling over the yard fence and turns just in time to see the owner, Milo Pressman (William Bronder), emerge, yelling for Chopper. Due to the dog's legendary reputation, when Milo shouts for Chopper to 'sick 'em, boy', Gordie imagines that what Milo's saying is 'sick balls'. Gordie frantically runs for the fence with the dog close on his heels but makes it over the top. He turns and sees that Chopper (Popeye) is not the dog he'd expected. Milo rushes over to the fence and berates the four boys for making fun of his dog. Teddy throws a few insults but is shocked silent when Milo calls his father a loony. Teddy breaks down, shouting that his father stormed the beach at Normandy, and has to be led away by the others.Following the train tracks, they come to a bridge. They hesitate to cross, unsure of when the next train is due. Feeling confident, they begin to cross with Chris and Teddy in the lead and Gordie trailing behind Vern, who's chosen to crawl instead of walk. Midway, Vern loses a comb that he packed in his shirt pocket which he'd hoped to use once they found the body and reported it to the local news. Gordie consistently looks back and bends down to feel the rails. A light vibration leads him to see plumes of smoke in the distance. He shouts ""TRAIN!"" and yells at Vern to get to his feet and run. They are barely able to make it to the other side and off the tracks. Chris jokes that now, at least, they know when the next train is.As they continue deeper into the forest, Chris lags behind with Gordie who is despondent about being a writer and doesn't think much of his talents. Chris tries to encourage him, saying that he wishes he was his father instead so that he could give him proper guidance and support. They set up camp for the night and Gordie tells them all a story about a kid named Lardass Hogan (Andy Lindberg), stuck with such a name because of his weight. Sick and tired of being made fun of for his considerable size, Lardass takes revenge on the rest of his town by forcing himself to violently throw up during a blueberry pie eating contest. What ensues is a comedic chain reaction of perpetual barfing.The boys decide to sleep in shifts and Gordie takes the opportunity, while Vern and Teddy sleep, to talk to Chris alone. Chris confides in him that he hates his family name and the association he has with them, wishing to leave to start fresh somewhere and actually make something of himself. He reveals that he did take the milk money at school first but felt remorseful about it and returned it to one of the teachers, who happened to show up to school the next day in a brand new dress. Chris took the heat for the theft but could never atone to it because of his family's reputation.The next morning, Ace and his gang are seen spending recreational time smoking and hitting mailboxes with baseball bats as they drive through their neighborhood. Billy and Charlie draw Ace's attention with their silence and they finally blab about finding Ray's body. Intent on claiming credit for himself, Ace heads out with them, along with Vince Desjardins (Jason Oliver Lipsett) and Eyeball.Meanwhile, Gordie and the others take a shortcut through the woods and land in a swamp infested with leeches. They strip down and Gordie finds one attached to his lower extremities, fainting after removing it. Eventually, they come back to the tracks and discover Ray's body (Kent W. Luttrell), knocked clean out of his shoes and lying in some bushes. They decide to build a stretcher for him and Gordie breaks down, crying that his father truly hates him and knowing that he favored Denny.At that moment, Ace and the rest of the gang appear and demand that the boys leave so they can take the body. Chris insults him and Ace pulls out a knife before Gordie fires the gun in the air. He threatens Ace, saying it'll be all too easy to kill him, and Ace leaves. Gordie announces that no one will get the credit for finding Ray; they will instead report it through an anonymous call.They return to town with Gordie narrating that it seemed so much smaller after their journey. As the boys split up and head home, Gordie narrates that Vern and Teddy grew distant over the next few years. Vern married straight out of high school, had four children, and became a fork lift driver at a lumberyard. Teddy attempted to join the army but was rejected due to his poor eyesight and ear injury. He eventually served some jail time and performed odd jobs around Castle Rock. Chris managed to stick it in school with Gordie and went to college to become a lawyer. However, it's revealed that he was stabbed and killed when he tried to break up a fight in a fast food restaurant; the very article Gordie read at the start of the film.Gordie closes the film as he finishes a memoir he's been writing about his childhood and leaves to take his son and friend (Chance QuinnandJason Naylor) out swimming."

District Attorney Tom Logan is set for higher office, at least until he becomes involved with defence lawyer Laura Kelly and her unpredictable client Chelsea Deardon. It seems the least of Chelsea's crimes is the theft of a very valuable painting, but as the women persuade Logan to investigate further and to cut some official corners, a much more sinister scenario starts to emerge.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26}"
Cobra,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090859/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A tough-on-crime street cop must protect the only surviving witness to a strange murderous cult with far-reaching plans. Criticised for his brutal and unconventional ways, hard-as-nails Lieutenant Cobra is the tip of the spear of LAPD's elite Zombie Squad. But crime runs rampant in the city. As a string of seemingly unconnected assaults on civilians drags the hardened officer into a violent war with the psychopaths of The New World, an underground cult aiming to weed out the weak, Cobra must escort key witness Ingrid to a safe house. However, the Night Slasher and the movement's delusional killers will stop at nothing to track her down. Now, there is no turning back--only one man stands in the way of the disease. Is the murderous cult prepared for swift justice and Cobra's deadly bite?—Nick Riganas A gang of thugs led by the self-proclaimed 'Night Slasher' are breaking into people's homes and cars, then killing them at random. When Lt. Cobretti - an intense, take-no-prisoners cop - confronts a 'New World' and the Night Slasher, Cobretti must protect a young woman, Ingrid Knutsen. Cobretti plans to move the only witness to the upstate, but the thugs follow them. And a battle for survival rages between Cobretti and the thugs.—Derek O'Cain ""Crime is a disease. Meet the cure."" Lt. Marion Cobretti, nicknamed Cobra, is a sunglasses wearing, matchstick chewing cop who is all about getting the criminal and breaking the rules. He has the entire department on his back all the time about his very violent and forceful way of getting the bad guys, normally making the punks end up in a body bag loaded with lead issued from his trusty pearl handled Colt .45.But Cobra is set a real challenge when a killer cult is spreading rapidly in the city. The cult kills innocent people, seeming to pick random victims and slaying them with jagged knifes and getting off on the hunted's fear. But they make a huge mistake when they kill a woman at an bus stop and a young model sees them. She doesn't exactly know that they've killed someone, but is extremely scared when one of the killers, a muscle bound and rather deformed looking man, gives her a spine chilling look. Soon the killers are after her! And they kill her photographer, a security guard and very nearly make her meet their sadistic style of murder. Cobra is soon on the scene, with his junk food loving partner, Sergeant Gonzales. They ask the young model, whose name turns out to be Ingrid, if she saw the killers. She says she only saw some people at the bus stop acting very odd and a man who scared her badly.But Cobra's progress into solving the case is halted by the pencil pushing, fat headed Detective Monte, who is always on his case about too much force. He tells Cobra that he's on the Zombie squad for a reason, he's too violent and doesn't please the press.Much too Monte's disgust, the Chief and Captain Sears decided to let Cobra use his street wise talk to fight the killer. Cobra goes through the entire population of the nocturnal seediness of downtown, where all the prostitutes, pimps, bar flies and cons of the city hang out. But
he doesn't find any kind of help from these people, they have no idea who the killers are.Cobra soon connects a supermarket killing, that involved a psycho who claimed that he was part of ""the new order"" who would wipe out the weak and make the strong survive, to the mass murders ripping at the soft under belly of the capital. But Detective Monte's smart mouth antics and somewhat spineless Captain Sears try to stop him from using aggressive force, not caring that Ingrid almost got killed by one of the cult followers, Night Slasher and that numerous other people were slayed in the hospital at night. The Captain agrees to let Cobra take Ingrid to the countryside with Gonzales and a female cop named Nancy Stalk. Little does he know that the heat is going to be turned up instead
of cooled off when they leave the city. Nancy is in fact a cult member and leading the Night Slasher and his cronies right to where Cobra is taking Ingrid.While in a motel that's off the beaten track, Ingrid and Cobra realize their attraction to one another. The romantic mood is short lived however, and the cult is back on Cobra's trail. They burn down the motel and almost kill Gonzales. Cobra and Ingrid ride off in a pick up truck and almost meet their end by crashing into a burning car that's blocking the road. Cobra still manages to take some punks down though, with a very nice piece of weaponry called the laser mount sub-machine gun.They end up in a steel mill and finally Night Slasher and Cobra come face to face. In a very psychotic speech Night Slasher says that Cobra's law is weak and that their cult will always survive. This sends Cobra off the deep end and Slasher onto a huge metal hook, that rips through his back and sends him off into a molten vat of metal. Nancy however is still alive and tries to kill Cobra, but she is also killed.After all the bloodshed, Cobra and Ingrid emerged slightly bruised and dirty, from the factory. The Captain congratulates Cobra, but Monte is too proud to actually admit that Cobra won the fight. He picks up his bit about too much excessive force, but earns himself a good punch from Cobra, sending him to the ground stone cold. Ingrid and Cobra ride off on a motorbike into the sunset to Kiss singing ""Can you get enough me baby, I can't get enough of you."" In true Stallone/ Cobra style, the day is saved and the conveniently pretty chic is too!"
An American Tail,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090633/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"While emigrating to the United States, a young Russian mouse gets separated from his family and must relocate them while trying to survive in a new country. Fievel is a young Russian mouse separated from his parents on the way to America, a land they think is without cats. When he arrives alone in the New World, he keeps up hope, searching for his family, making new friends, and running and dodging the cats he thought he'd be rid off.—Michael Silva <silvamd@cleo.bc.edu> The film begins in the small Russian village of Shostka as the camera zooms in on the Moskowitz house. Then, the camera pans down to a tiny door marked Mousekewitz, the dwelling of a mouse family that includes Papa (voiced by Nehemiah Persoff), Mama (voiced by Erica Yohn), their son, Fievel (voiced by Phillip Glasser), their daughter, Tanya (voiced by Amy Green), and a baby, Yasha. Inside their tiny living quarters, Papa plays his violin while Mama takes care of the baby. Fievel comes running into the room asking about Hanukkah presents. Papa presents Tanya with a new babushka and gives Fievel a new hat (Papas hat that has been passed down from father to son for generations). The hat is far too big, but the boys mother tells him he will grow into it.
As part of their Hanukkah celebration, the Mousekewitz children encourage Papa to tell them the story of the Giant Mouse of Minsk, who was as tall as a tree and scared all the cats. Mama doesnt like even a mention of the word ""cats,"" and asks them to talk about something else. The children want to hear about America, which Mama thinks is just another fairy tale, but Papa appears to drift off into a dream world as he talks about the opportunity of a new and better life in America where mouse holes are everywhere, bread crumbs are on every floor, mice can say anything they want, and, he knows for a fact, there are not cats.
Just then, they are attacked. Humans and mice run from their homes as the Cossacks attack the humans and their homes, while the ""Catsacks"" attack the mice and their dwellings. Brave little Fievel tries to scare the cats away by banging loudly on a skillet with a spoon, but he is chased and almost killed by the cats. Suddenly, the pogram is over and the Cossacks and Catsacks withdraw. Afterwards, as they survey the damage, Papa whispers, ""In America, there are no cats."" The scene shifts to a Hamburg, Germany shipyard where a band plays an oom-pah tune as the mice, including the Mousekewitz family, climb a rope to board a ship bound for America. Fievel creates problems with his wide-eyed wonder and constant questions. Once they are on board, the mice shout their goodbyes to the other mice on the pier as the ship departs.	During the voyage, Papa plays his violin in the mouses small section of the ship away from the humans. Just like all children, Fievel asks, ""Are we there yet?"" Tanya is afraid theyve made a poor decision to travel to America, but Papa reassures her that everything will be all right as long as they stay together.
Later, Fievel discovers a barrel of herring and Papa tells him about even larger fish in the ocean. The mischievous boy wants to see them. When he tells his mother about the fish, she says theyre lucky they didnt see cats. The dreaded word causes all the mice to shutter. Papa reassures all his fellow mice passengers that America will be wonderful because there are no cats there. His statement leads the mice to tell horror stories of cats as they sing ""There Are No Cats in America."" After Papa sings a verse, all the mice join in the chorus; then, an Italian mouse sings about the cat problems in his country, after which the mice all joyfully sing the chorus; next an Irishman sings a verse, after which the mice celebrate and sing the chorus again.
Soon, a storm hits and the ship rocks, which causes a lot of seasickness. While Fievel is warming himself by the stove, a piece of burning coal burns his tail. When he jumps, he is washed him around the ship until he ends up at the bottom of the stairs leading to the deck. He is fascinated when a wave washes some fish down the stairs, so he climbs up to see more. Out on deck, he is overcome by the storm and the waves. Fievel imagines all sorts of sea monsters in the waves of the storm. After one particularly large wave, Fievel is washed overboard and the ship sails away into the storm.
The following scene is of Castle Gardens, the immigration depot in New York City. As both humans and mice go through immigration, they are given new American names. When the Mousekewitz family passes through they are sad that they are now a family of four not five. The immigration officials change Tanyas name to Tillie. Next, we see a small bottle flowing on the water. As a chorus sings ""Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor,"" the words written on the Statue of Liberty, the audience sees Fievel inside the bottle. As he peers through the bottle, he sees the Statue is under construction. When the bottle washes ashore, a French pigeon, Henri (voiced by Christopher Plummer), who claims to be building the statue, discovers him. After Henri cleans up the little immigrant, Fievel talks despondently about the possibility that he will never find his family. Henri, in a Maurice Chevalier-type voice, boosts the boys confidence by singing ""Never Say Never."" Fievel and three female pigeons join in the song. Afterwards, Henri instructs one of the females to fly Fievel to immigration.
The next scene is the city, which is full of immigrants humans and mice and they are all being hustled by con artists. One of the slickest of the scoundrels preying on the unsuspecting newcomers is Warren T. Rat (voiced by John Finnegan). His constant companion is his cockroach accountant, Digit (voiced by Will Ryan).
Upset that he has made fifty cents less today than yesterday, Warren T. spies the innocent Fievel, introduces himself and claims he can take the boy to his parents. Fievel follows the rat anticipating the reintroduction to his family right away.
Meanwhile, at the Mousekewitzs new home, an old, discarded physicians bag, Tanya tells her parents that she has a feeling that her brother is still alive. Just as she looks out a window, Fievel and Warren T. pass unseen nearby.
When Warren T. takes Fievel into a building and opens a door, Fievel excitedly looks inside for his family. He is grabbed by a mean character named Moe (voiced by Hal Smith). Fievel has been tricked and is now in a workhouse or sweatshop. Warren T. reminds Moe to send Fievels salary to him. That evening, Fievel ties several sheets together and escapes by climbing down the sheets to the street. Tony Toponi (voiced by Pat Musick), an Italian immigrant mouse, gives Fievel an Americanized name, Philly. Once he is out of the workhouse, Fievel unknowingly walks right past his familys home in the doctors bag. As Fievel wanders the lonely streets, we hear ""Poor Wand'ring One."" Once, the boy hears someone calling his name, but its another mother calling her son named Fievel. Later, he hears someone playing a violin and thinks its his Papa. He is very disappointed to discover the sound is coming from an Edison cylinder recording. When the lady of the house changes the cylinder, Sousas march, ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" blasts from the speaker, which causes Fievel to fall into the player. The sight of a mouse frightens the lady who chases Fievel out a window.
After some more wandering, Fievel runs into Tony Toponi again, who volunteers to help find the kids family. At the same time, Tanya and Papa leave their home to search for Fievel and at one point, Tony and Fievel walk directly above Tanya and Papa and neither sees the other.
During their search, Tony and Fievel happen to pass a rally where a pretty Irish mouse, Bridget (voiced by Cathianne Blore), is trying to convince the other mice to organize in order to defeat the cats. Tony is immediately smitten with Bridget. While Tony gets acquainted with Bridget, Fievel tells the crowd they have nothing to fear because his Papa told him there werent any cats in America. Just then, from behind a crate, a cat pounces on Fievel and almost eats him. After a frantic chase where Fievel avoids becoming the cats meal, Bridget suggests she and Tony take Fievel to see Honest John (voiced by Neil Ross), a local politician, who knows all the mice in the city. Just as soon as Tony, Bridget and Fievel leave, the Mousekewtiz family emerges from under the rubble that is left from the cat attack. Mama sarcastically asks Papa, ""there are no whats in America?"" Papa sheepishly snickers.
When the new trio of friends arrives at Honest Johns, Gussie Mausheimer (voiced by Madeline Kahn), the richest mouse in the city, is also there to complain about the cat attack. She recommends a ""wally"" (Gussie cant pronounce ""r""s) of all the mice, rich and poor, to decide a course of action against the cats. When Gussie leaves, Honest John is ready to help Fievel find his family until he discovers that the Mousekewitzs are too new in the country to be registered voters. He is only interested in helping if votes are his reward.
That night, Fievel sleeps in a water tower where Bridget lives. She encourages the boy and tells him she is certain his family is out there somewhere just waiting to be found. After Bridget leaves, Fievel gets out of bed, goes to a knothole in the wall, looks out over the city and, as the moon rises, sings ""Somewhere, Out There."" From her doctors bag home, Tanya joins Fievel in the song. They dream of reuniting their family.
At the rally in the park, Fievel is on the speakers stand with Bridget and Tony, while his family is in the audience, but once again, they dont see each other. Gussie delivers a stirring speech about coming to America for freedom freedom from cats. When she asks for ideas concerning a course of action, no one offers any suggestions until Fievel steps forward and whispers an idea into her ear. She smiles, whispers the idea to Honest John, and then announces to the crowd that they have a plan.
Early the following day, all the mice go to Dr. Digitalus Museum of the Weird and Bizarre, which is located on a pier. They collect various objects from the museum and begin to build a large contraption. Tony wakes up late, so he grabs Fievel out of his bathtub bed and they run towards the pier to help the other mice. Fievel has trouble keeping up, trips and falls into a sewer grate. When he thinks he hears his Papa playing his violin, Fievel drops down into the sewer and follows the music. He finally discovers the source of music in a place marked ""Mott Street Maulers."" The music is coming from a player piano and a violinist. Inside, a group of cats are playing poker. One of the cats is Tiger (voiced by Dom Deluise), a large orange cat, who is pretty dimwitted.
When the camera pans up to the music, the violin player is Warren T. Rat. Warren T. complains he cant play because of his nose, so he removes his false nose and ears, which reveals that he is really a cat. Fievel blurts out ""He's a cat!"" Warren orders the other cats to capture the intruder. Tiger tries to help, but is more trouble than help. A big chase ensues. Just when it seems Fievel has escaped again, a paw grabs him and pulls him back into the sewer.
Back at the museum, Gussie explains the plan to the other mice. They are going to scare the cats onto a ship that is bound for Hong Kong with the contraption they have built. Since the ship departs at 6 a.m., the mice must lure the cats to the pier at that precise time.
Fievel is being held prisoner in a birdcage in the sewer and is being guarded by Tiger. When Tiger finds out that Fievel lost his family, he empathizes because he lost his family too. We also learn that Tiger is a vegetarian cat. Once Fievel and Tiger become friends, they perform a song and dance routine together titled ""A Duo."" Digit, the cockroach, sees the prisoner and his guard frolicking together and tells his boss. Fievel manages to escape, so Warren T. fires Tiger.
Back on the street, Fievel heads to the pier with the cats right behind. Inside the museum, the mice are sleeping, but Fievels frantic screams wake them up. The cats are ten minutes early, but since the cats are there, the mice in charge of the secret weapon release it. Since it is too early, Honest John and some other mice finally stop it. In front of the museum, Tony shoots Warrens fake nose off exposing him as a cat. Then, Warren sets fire to the museum. Gussie, who is watching the clock, commands the secret weapon be released. Fievel grabs a piece of burning wood and burns the rope that is restraining the weapon. When it begins to move, it throws Fievel up against the wall and knocks him out. Out of the burning building the contraption, the Giant Mouse of Minsk (from the story Fievels Papa had told them), comes rolling down the pier and frightens the cats. They run down the pier, into the water and are lifted onto the departing vessel by the ships anchor.
During the mices celebration, Tanya hears Honest John say, ""We owe it all to Philly."" She asks Papa, ""Who is Philly?""
Leaking kerosene causes the fire to spread and the pier is consumed in flames. Bridget and Tony look for Philly but all they find is his hat. Tanya hears them calling Philly and reminds her father that immigration changed her name to Tillie. She runs towards the calls; Papa and Mama follow. When they meet Tony, Mama recognizes Fievels hat. Fievel is revived by the firemens water hoses. The force of the water washes him through a hole in the floor. He ends up in Orphans Alley where he meets a group of street urchins who convince him to give up hope of ever finding his family. They tell him if his family really cared, they would have found him by now. Fievel cries himself to sleep.
The next morning when Fievel awakes, he hears someone calling his name, but he thinks it is just a dream. Gussie, Tony, Bridget, and his family are riding on Tiger searching for him. Fievel finally pays attention when he hears Papa playing his violin. When he shouts ""Papa,"" his father hears him, jumps off of Tiger and runs towards his son for a happy reunion.

Police Academy 3: Back in Training,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091777/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The alumni of Commandant Lassard'sPolice Academy (1984)return to the school to train new recruits and prevent its closure. After completing their mission inPolice Academy 2: Their First Assignment (1985), Officer Carey Mahoney, and the rest of the original graduates from Commandant Eric Lassard'sPolice Academy (1984)find themselves with their backs to the wall. It seems that, due to funding cutbacks, there can only be one police institution in the city, and Commandants Lassard and Mauser must do their best to get Governor Neilson's approval. Of course, conniving Mauser has already concocted an ingeniously evil plan to sabotage his rivals. Can Mahoney, along with a handful of recruits, save the day and their beloved academy?—Nick Riganas The city has two police academies, one is under the eye of Commandant Lassard and the other is under Commandant Mauser. Now Mauser has learned that the State is considering closing one of the academies, and to protect himself, he approaches Blanks and Copeland and instructs them to make sure that Lassard's cadets all foul up. Lassard on the other hand calls his ""favorite graduates"", Mahoney, Hightower, Jones, Tackleberry, and Hooks, and along with their former instructor, Callahan, they try to train the cadets and hopefully save their academy.—rcs0411@yahoo.com From the beginning, they were a breed apart. They were raw, inept, blunderheaded civilians who signed up for the Police Academy. And they became raw, inept, blunderheaded cops. Then, the bumblers in blue took to the streets to confront a crime wave . . . and somehow refrained from waving back. Now the lovable lunkheads with the fun-track minds are at it again. Determined to save their alma mater from getting the ax during a state-wide budget slash are the gifted, goofy original Police Academy grads: Mahoney, Hightower, Tackleberry, Jones, Hooks and Callahan, all led by the befuddled but unbowed Cmdt. Lassard. Also in the arresting cast are several returnees from the school's second adventure, including meddling Cmdt. Mauser.—Official DVD cover The film begins in a large garage structure, where Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) and Commandant Mauser (Art Metrano) meet up with former cadets (now Sgts.) Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson) and Kyle Blanks (Brant van Hoffman) from Commandant Lassard's police academy. It seems one of the two police academies is getting the axe due to the state government's unwillingness to continue financing two academies, and Mauser wants Copeland and Blanks to make sure Lassard fails. The men agree to the plan, knowing this may be their only chance at revenge against Lassard for graduating them at the bottom of their class.The following day, after the governor's Neilson (Ed Nelson) speech in which he will appoint a committee to evaluate which of the two academies should remain open, Mauser starts getting an edge by kissing up to the governor, but Sgt. Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) quickly prevents this by discreetly humiliating Mauser in front of the governor with his noise imitations that sound like belching. Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) gets an idea on how to win: along with now Sgt. Jones and Lt. Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), he calls back Sgt. Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Sgt. Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Sgt. Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), and Sgt. Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) to help train the new recruits.
Among the new recruits are Sgt. Douglas Fackler's wife, Violet (Debralee Scott), whom Sgt. Fackler (Bruce Mahler) is against being trained to be a police officer; Carl Sweetchuck (Tim Kazurinsky) and Zed McGlunk (Bobcat Goldthwait), who have a history from the second movie as a meek small business owner being harassed by a gang led by Zed; Karen Adams (Shawn Weatherly), a beautiful young woman whom Mahoney is attracted to but who rejects his overtures; and Tackleberry's brother-in-law Bud Kirkland (Andrew Paris). Tomoko Nogata (Brian Tochi) is at first a recruit of Mauser's academy, but Mauser transfers him in with Lassard's academy instead in hopes of sabotaging the latter' academy further (as TOmoko is on an exchange program from Tokyo and is not very well trained in English).After a few weeks of training, Nogata is love-struck over Callahan. Sweetchuck contemplates quitting after Zed, whom he was forced to room with, drives him crazy (Zed plays music all night, scares him all the time with sudden moves and so on), but Tackleberry talks him out of it and takes him under his wing. Copeland and Blanks make the recruits do things (Handle live fire drills, go on field assignments and so on which they are not trained for) that would make the committee think they are incompetent. The recruits fail (one police car and one civilian car totaled, 3 complaints, 2 committee members injured) and are teased by Mauser and Proctor. However, Mahoney gets back at them by taping Mauser's eyes closed while doing a taste test. Proctor succeeds in removing the tape, but the tape pulls off Mauser's eyebrows.Both Lassard and Mahoney give a pep talk to each of the cadets before training resumes. Adams finally warms up to Mahoney after his pep talk and bonds with him for the rest of the film. At the police-persons' ball, Mahoney meets up with his prostitute friend from the first film (Georgina Spelvin), and has her do a favor on Proctor after the latter insults Mahoney and Adams. The prostitute tricks Proctor into removing all his clothes and then locking him out of the hotel room, and while trying to get back to his academy (in a stolen car), Proctor accidentally enters the Blue Oyster Bar (the car runs out of gas, and Proctor jumps in the first open door to avoid an incoming squad car). Meanwhile, Mauser insults Lassard in front of the recruits by telling him that he is winning, so Mahoney gets him back by giving a speech at the ball and then putting the microphone in a pitcher of water. When Mauser grabs it, the microphone shocks him.On the final day of the cadet training/evaluation competition, one recruit from each academy attends the governor's ball (Proctor misunderstands and sends in two, one of whom is portrayed by David James Elliott). Copeland and Blanks play with the computer system and send cars to the wrong locations in their attempt to help Mauser win, but they are caught by Hooks, who knocks them out cold.
At the governor's party, a gang of thieves dressed as busboys start robbing the guests and take the governor hostage. Mauser's cadets promptly faint upon being threatened by the thieves, but Lassard's cadet Hedges (David Huband) manages to alert Lassard's team before being taken hostage too, prompting Mahoney and the gang to rescue the governor. Mauser's academy proves to be ineffective to react to the emergency, but Lassard's squad arrives just in time to fight off the thieves and rescue the governor.As a result of the governor's final judgment, Mauser's academy is shut down due to them being ineffective in stopping the robbery at the party, while Lassard's stays open. The epilogue shows Lassard delivering a speech on how the academy is grateful for the ""many, many"" recruits. The graduating class salutes the camera as the film ends."
Heartbreak Ridge,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091187/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Hard-nosed, hard-living Marine Gunnery Sergeant Tom Highway clashes with his superiors and his ex-wife as he takes command of a spoiled recon platoon with a bad attitude. 1983. Thomas Highway (Clint Eastwood) is a well-decorated career military man in the United States Marine Corps, he who has seen action in Korea and Vietnam. His current rank is Gunnery Sergeant. His experiences have led him to become an opinionated, no nonsense man, who is prone to bursts of violence, especially when he's drunk, if the situation does not suit him, regardless of the specifics or people involved. Because of these actions, he has spent his fair share of overnighters behind bars. Close to retirement, one of his last assignments, one he requested, is back at his old unit at Cherry Point, North Carolina, from where he was transferred for insubordination and conduct unbecoming. He is to train a reconnaissance platoon. His superior officer, the much younger and combat inexperienced Major Malcolm Powers (Everett McGill), sees Highway as a relic of an old-styled military. Highway's commanding officer, Lieutenant Ring (Boyd Gaines), the platoon leader, is also a younger man who has no combat experience, but is academically inclined and happy-go-lucky. Highway finds that his team is a rag-tag bunch of slackers, who includes wannabe rock musician Corporal Stitch Jones (Mario Van Peebles), with whom Highway had an inauspicious earlier meeting. The men in the platoon, who truly believe Highway is crazy, hate him, and don't understand why they have to follow his harsh training regimen when the United States is not currently at war. The Major, who is all about efficiency regardless of combat readiness, has the same views of Highway. He is clear that he sees Highway's platoon solely as a training mechanism for his own elite squad trained by Highway's nemesis, Staff Sergeant Webster (Moses Gunn). Things for Highway and his platoon change when the United States enters into war in Grenada. Through it all, Highway tries to reconnect with his bar waitress ex-wife Aggie (Marsha Mason), he even clandestinely reading women's magazines to understand her better. Two primary obstacles stand in his way: Roy Jennings (Bo Svenson), Aggie's boss and current suitor who hates Marines, and Aggie's own remembrance of how dysfunctional their marriage was.—Huggo Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway (Clint Eastwood), a hardened, tough veteran of Korea and Vietnam returns to the United States for his last tour of duty with the U.S. Marine Corps. He is assigned to training a recon unit. Their cool, trendy and ""hippy"" approach to military life is a reminder to him that he is, in the words of his commanding officer, a Major, ""an anachronism"", useful only ""in the event of war"". Conveniently, a war does arise (the invasion of Grenada in October, 1983) and successfully tests both his usefulness and the effectiveness of the new recruits.—Dave Cook <cookd@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca> Marine Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway (Clint Eastwood) has been in the Corps since the Korean War and would like to see some action and a victory before he retires. He requests to be transfered to the unit of which he was once busted out. Upon arriving, Commanding Officer Major Malcolm Powers (Everett McGill) knows of Highway's reputation, especially of his lack of respect for his superiors, and warns him that he is going to keep an eye on him. Highway's assigned to train a recon unit which consists mostly of deadbeats. But Highway's determined to turn them into true Marines and they are not exactly pleased with him, at first. And he is also trying to reconnect with his ex-wife Aggie (Marsha Mason).—rcs0411@yahoo.com The story opens in the drunk tank of a small town jail. Marine Gunnery Sergeant Tom Highway is sharing stories about his combat service with the other prisoners. At one point, he's interrupted by another prisoner who mocks Highway's military rank. Highway immediately beats the man, easily disarming him after he pulls a knife on the sergeant. The next day in court, Highway is given one last chance by the judge after being charged with public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. That doesn't sit well with the cop whose squad car Highway urinated on. He insults Highway, telling him his heroics are old news and that he doesn't give any serviceman discounts. Highway counters with an insult of his own and leaves.Highway returns to his base where he works in supply. He roughly turns down a bribe from another officer who offers him a supply of Cuban cigars. Highway reports to his commanding officer, who tells him he's being transferred to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina where he'll be training unmotivated marines. Highway takes the bus to Camp Lejeune, meeting a young man, Stitch Jones, a budding rock guitarist who had just been kicked out of the club he was performing in for starting a fight with a group of locals. Jones is an instant irritation to Highway with constant chatter while Highway tries to get some sleep. When the bus stops at a roadside diner, Jones waits until Highway goes into the men's room and steals his bus ticket. The bus leaves before Highway can catch up with it and Jones.Highway arrives at Camp Lejeune and reports to his commanding officer. Before meeting with the man, Highway catches up with and old friend, Sgt Major Choozoo. Highway's & Choozoo's new CO, Major Malcolm Powers, used to work in Supply and was a big football hero at Annapolis. He is even stricter than Highway and immediately assumes that Highway, who has a history of conflict with superiors, will be trouble. Highway's past also includes an incident where he struck an officer who was classmate of Powers at Annapolis Academy. Powers assigns Highway to the battalion's ""recon"" (reconnaissance) platoon, one where the men are unmotivated, slightly out of physical shape, and have already gone through several sergeants who failed to get them up to the battalion's expectations. Making matters worse, Highway is saddled with Lieutenant Ring, a milquetoast officer who lacks the necessary stern nature of a platoon leader.Highway leaves the meeting and meets the recon platoon, finding them just as lazy as Powers said they would be. At first, the men are scornful of Highway and pay him little attention. Highway destroys their boom box and suggests they have one last night of freedom before he begins his regimen of training the next day. Just then, Stitch Jones walks into the rec room and is instantly recognized by Highway. Highway drags Jones by the ear to his bunk to pay him for the bus ticket he stole. When Jones' claims he's unable to pay back some money he also stole from Highway, Highway rips out Jones' earring, telling the men to be ready by six AM for training. After Highway leaves, the men conspire to have their biggest unit member, Swede Johanson, currently serving time in the brig, to take care of Highway when he's released.Highway goes to the local bar and apartment house, meeting Little Mary Jackson, the wife of one of Highway's old combat buddies who was killed in Vietnam. She rents him a room and tells him that his former wife, Aggie, is working at a local bar popular with younger Marines. Highway goes there and finds Aggie, who is also seeing the bar's owner, Roy Jennings, a hulking man who hates Marines. While Highway tries to patch things up with Aggie, Stitch Jones performs live. He's heckled by a small group of Marines at one of the tables. Jones fires back easily at his hecklers. A fight nearly breaks out and despite Jones' own defusing of the other Marines, Jennings moves in, shoving the Marines around even after they've calmed down. Highway steps in threateningly, but Jones and Aggie talk the two men out of fighting each other. Jennings throws Highway and Jones out of the bar.The next morning, Highway wakes the recon platoon at five AM instead of six. When they complain, he tells them they need to adapt to any situation. He lines them up for physical training (PT) and orders them to take off their mismatched t-shirts, saying they'll all wear the same or none at all. The platoon begrudgingly complies and Highway orders them to run for the day.The next day, he orders the t-shirts off again, even though they were wearing the same ones. (HIGHWAY: ""Same as me?"") While doing PT, Highway surprises them by shooting at them with an AK-47 assault rifle and live ammunition, announcing that it's the ""preferred"" weapon of their enemy & makes a ""distinctive sound"" when fired.When not training his Marines, Highway studies up on women's magazines, trying to understand how they think. He also keeps an eye on Aggie, who gets escorted home every night from the bar by Roy.One morning, the platoon refuses to muster, several of them mouthing off and Jones introducing Highway to Swede Johanson. Swede tries to hit Highway, who dodges and blocks the bigger man's blow, forcing him to his knees. Highway hits Swede once on the jaw, knocking him to the deck. The rest of the platoon, their plan foiled, runs out for muster. Swede regains his composure & tells Highway he'll wait for the MPs outside. Highway, knowing that his comrades were using Swede, tells him to join his platoon for PT, willing to forget the incident if Swede shapes up.Other little hints begin to form about Highway caring for his men. When Profile accidentally discharges his rifle at the target range and almost hits Major Powers, Highway stays with him while Powers makes him run circles around his marching platoon back to the barracks. Profile soon collapses from exhaustion. Highway says something quietly to his man and Profile suddenly gives a loud war cry and takes up his run again. When Powers asks Highway what he said to Profile, Highway growls ""I told him 'Don't give the prick the satisfaction, Sir.' ""Major Powers arranges a combat exercise involving his own pet project, 1st Platoon, and wants Recon to act as a target to sharpen his unit's skills. Highway goes off book and executes a mock ambush. Powers is ready to arrest him for insubordination, but Lt. Ring, feeling guilty about putting Highway in that position in the first place, takes responsibility for it, saying he'd given Highway permission to freelance the platoon. Before Highway leaves Powers' office, he asserts that if recon went into combat improperly trained, at least half of them would die. Powers threatens to discharge Highway if he screws up again, saying it's in Highway's nature to do so. As Highway leaves, he meets Ring outside who apologizes for the incident. Highway acknowledges Ring's position and his willingness to accept responsibility for the incident.A slightly depressed Highway is met later at Little Mary's place by Choozoo. He laments about how restrictive and incompetent Powers is being and that he'd never lead his men into combat if they're not properly trained. Choozoo tells Highway about a conversation he'd had with Powers recently where Powers told him that marines like them are ""0-1-1""; no wins in combat, 1 tie (Korea) and one loss (Vietnam)"". The thought seems to depress Highway even more. Just then, Little Mary walks in and informs them that they have to report back for unit deployment.At the base, Highway's platoon is frantic, trying to ready their gear and get out to the parade ground for muster. Jones stammers about the missing Aponte (whose prior absence his mates had been covering up), whom he fears will be charged AWOL. At the muster site, Highway asks Powers to issue Ring a set of night-vision goggles. Powers, already going through his strict routine of supplying the battalion with ammo and other equipment, tells Highway he'll have to fill out a request form for the item. Highway is taken aback and tells the battalion chief so when he reports. Just then the announcement comes through that the deployment was a readiness exercise and the base is standing down. Powers is disappointed.Highway finds Jones in the rec room and demands to know where he can find Aponte. After a harsh retort from Jones, Jones takes him to Aponte's house off the base. Aponte tells Highway that what his salary from the Corps isn't enough to support his wife and kids so he took a part-time job. Highway is exasperated but shows he genuinely understands when he agrees to cover for Aponte and gives him a small amount of money to help out. As they leave, Highway tells Jones never to pull another stunt like that again and drives off, leaving Jones to walk back to the base.Highway goes to visit Aggie and tries to talk to her, asking her what he could have done to fix their marriage. She said he was Marine through and through and had a hard time changing. She even accused him of trying to get back in with her by changing up his tactics, throwing him out of her house. A pissed-off Highway gets drunk and ends up in jail, joined by Jones, who got arrested when he protested a fixed band contest at a local bar. Aggie and Choozoo come to bail Highway out, and Aggie reads him the riot act about how hard it was for her to be married to him while he was fighting in Vietnam and not knowing if he would come home alive when so many others didn't. All of her anger came out, and she hits Highway, but she apologizes and breaks down crying in his arms. He holds on to her and comforts her.Back in the bar, Choozoo tells Jones about the history of the place and the Marines who are honored there, mostly in the photographs covering the walls. He also tells Jones about his and Highway's combat experiences in both Korea and Vietnam. One of their guys, Sonny Jackson (Little Mary's husband), was killed at Khe Sanh in 1968. Their combat in Korea was particularly rough, with their entire platoon being wiped out except for Choozoo, Jackson and Highway. Highway himself took out two enemy emplacements, despite extreme exhaustion. Much to Jones' astonishment, Highway won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his efforts. Little Mary offers to make them something to eat and Jones sees that Mary is holding a stack of Highway's t-shirts. When he asks her about them, she tells him she puts out his clothes for him in the morning before he leaves for the base. Jones smiles widely, knowing he's got an upper hand. The next morning when Highway meets his platoon, they're all wearing the same shirt he is, suggesting Jones only had to place a quick phone call to Mary. Highway smiles slightly, impressed with their ability to adapt.Highway leads his now well-motivated Marines into a competition against 1st Platoon, parachuting to a designated target, the Marine Bear Pit, to earn a 72-hour liberty. He even gets Swede, who is afraid of heights, to skydive by admitting he was afraid of heights, too. Recon and 1st Platoon get there at the same time, and despite Powers' insistence Choozoo make 1st Platoon the winner, Choozoo goes to a tiebreaker called a ""Matchup"". Both units get in the Bear Pit and fight each other hand-to-hand to claim victory. The battle eventually comes down to Jones and two of 1st Platoon's men. They seemingly get Jones under control and haul him out of the Bear Pit until Jones viciously grabs their crotches hard and pulls them out instead. Powers claims that 1st Platoon won only because Jones cheated. Highway says Jones improvised, adapted and overcame. When Powers orders Choozoo to declare 1st Platoon the victor, Choozoo decides to let Highway and Powers battle. Despite his bragging that he'll defeat Highway, Powers is defeated by Highway and hauled out, clinching recon's victory.Powers sends Sgt. Webster, 1st Platoon's sergeant, known for kissing up to Powers, to get statements from Recon that Highway used live ammunition on the training exercises, even bribing them with weekend liberty. Recon refuses to inform on Highway, having found new respect for their their own commander.Aggie finds Highway at a Commanding Officer's party and they enjoy a nice dance. Highway admits to reading the magazines and is trying to understand how women think, hoping he could reconcile with Aggie. However, Aggie tells him Roy asked her to marry him. Before Highway finds out her answer, his unit is immediately activated for mobilization for the 1983 invasion of Grenada.On the hangar bay of the USS Belleau Wood, Ring briefs the men of their mission: to helicast on the western side of the island of Grenada and recon in advance of the battalion landing team. Their ultimate goal is to rescue American students of St Georges Medical University who are being held hostage.Despite their nervousness about seeing real combat, Recon boards a UH-1 Huey and drops into the water and swims ashore. While advancing inland they make hostile contact with forward patrols and machine gun fighting positions of enemy soldiers and come under heavy fire. While his men keep the attention of the enemy focused on them, Highway moves in behind and kills the soldiers who try to retreat into the jungle. He looks one of them over, finding a fine cigar and announces they're a small Cuban recon team. He gruffly tells his men to spread out and keep a close watch for more of the enemy.Highway's unit moves in on a lightly-guarded bridge. They come under fire again and Highway orders them to improvise: Jones hot wires a bulldozer to provide cover so they can advance on and destroy an enemy machine gun nest. They take out the nest on the far side of the bridge and take down the Cuban flag flying above it. One of their number asks for forgiveness from a soldier he killed, his first such kill in combat. The recon unit moves towards the university as ordered and secure the area, rescuing the captured students. In a humorous incident, the jumpy Fragetti is surprised by a skeleton in a medical lab and shoots the place up. Highway finds him and tells him he's improved his rifle skills.After linking up with Powers, Highway, Ring, and the platoon are then ordered on another recon mission: investigate a hill where air support spotted an enemy arsenal. They are also given strict orders by Powers not to take the hill until he and 1st Platoon arrive. En route, they're caught under fire, Ring and the platoon make the mistake of trapping themselves in a structure rather than staying out of sight. A blast from a HRAKM armored tank knocks out their radio and kills Profile. Ring is beside himself for leading the men into a trap and getting Profile killed, but Highway gets him to refocus. Ring finds a telephone they could use to order an air strike by calling Camp Lejeune long-distance, but Jones has to go on the roof to find where the line is cut, successfully reconnecting the line and letting Ring use one of Jones' credit cards to pay for the call to Camp Lejeune. Ring gives their coordinates successfully but the line suddenly goes dead. Saying they'll have to improvise, Highway goes out to light a smoke marker to tell their position, and comes under fire, seemingly taking a grenade hit. The men look to Ring to lead, which he does by leading them out to get the unconscious Highway. The air strike comes through, the enemy is routed and Highway is actually uninjured and ready to resume command. Buoyed by their success, the men look to Ring for their next order. Ring rouses them, shouting that they'll take the hill.They make their way to the rebel position, destroy it, and capture the men inside while Highway enjoys the cigar he'd taken earlier, proud to see his men become real Marines. When Powers arrives and finds out, he bawls both Highway and Ring out and threatens Highway with a court-martial, even ready to assault Highway himself, but Highway remains defiant, pointedly telling Powers that he bores him.Their commanding officer, Colonel Meyers, arrives with Choozoo, and Powers reports that Ring and Highway disobeyed direct orders. Meyers asks where Powers came from and Powers said he came from Supply and was good at it. Meyers then tells Powers to stick with Supply since Highway and Ring, despite disobeying orders, took the initiative & came out the victors, completing a difficult mission under harsh circumstances. Proud of how his unit did with the mission, he gruffly tells Highway and Choozoo to leave the area and see to the cleanup operation. As they walk away, Highway tells Choozoo that they're not ""0-1-1"" anymore since they've chalked up a victory in combat.Highway and his men return to the U.S. and are met by a warm reception. Aggie is there to welcome him back, too. To Highway's mock dismay, Stitch informs him that he is going to give up his music and make a career for himself in the Marines, while Highway takes his mandatory retirement. All of the Marines are celebrating with friends and family as Highway and Aggie walk off into the distance of airplane hangars."

The Freeling family move in with Diane's mother in an effort to escape the trauma and aftermath of Carol Anne's abduction by the Beast. But the Beast is not to be put off so easily and appears in a ghostly apparition as the Reverend Kane, a religeous zealot responsible for the deaths of his many followers. His goal is simple - he wants the angelic Carol Anne; but the love of her family and the power of psychic Tangina once again unite, along with an elderly native American, to fight for her life.—Rhino <rhino@blueyonder.co.uk> One year after the events of Poltergeist, Cuesta Verde, the Freelings' neighborhood from the first film, is being evacuated and turned into an archeological paranormal dig, centered around the spot where the Freelings' home stood before it imploded. The excavation leads to the discovery of an underground cave by a ground crew. Its existence is revealed to psychic Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein), who tells a friend of hers, Taylor (Will Sampson), an American Indian shaman. After investigating the cave for himself, Taylor realizes that Kane, a demon disguised as a preacher, has located Carol Anne and goes to defend her.The Freeling family, Steven (Craig T. Nelson), Diane (JoBeth Williams), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), has relocated to Phoenix, Arizona and now live in a house with Diane's mother, Jessica ""Grandma Jess"" Wilson (Geraldine Fitzgerald). Having lost his real estate license, Steve is reduced to selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door while filing repeated insurance claims to cover the missing home. Grandma Jess is highly clairvoyant, and says that Diane and Carol Anne are clairvoyant as well. Grandma Jess later dies from natural causes, but not before telling Diane one last time that she'll always ""be there"" if she needs her.
Taylor shows up as Kane begins his first assault on the home. Unable to get in through the television as the family has removed all television sets from the home, Kane's minions are forced to find another way in, this time through Carol Anne's toy phone. The attack fails, and the family gets out of the house fast. Taylor introduces himself and convinces them that running would be a waste of time since Kane would only find them again, and they return to the house, which Taylor has made safe for the time being.Kane himself shows up at the home one day in human form, and demands to be let in, but Steven stands up to him and refuses. Taylor congratulates him for resisting Kane, and then takes Steve out to the desert and gives him the Power of Smoke, an Indian spirit that can repel Kane. Tangina shows up at the house and helps Diane to understand the history of Kane and how he became the Beast that is now stalking the family: he was once a man, the Reverend Henry Kane, who led his followers into the cave because he believed the end of the world was coming, then refused to let them leave after the date he predicted came and went. Because he was so evil, Kane became a monster after death. Taylor warns the family that Kane is extremely clever, and will try to tear them apart.
One night, Steven lets his guard down and gets drunk, swallowing a Mezcal worm that is possessed by Kane, who temporarily possesses him.

Short Circuit,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Number 5 of a group of experimental robots in a lab is electrocuted, suddenly becomes intelligent, and escapes. Number 5, one of a group of experimental military robots, undergoes a sudden transformation after being struck by lightning. He develops self-awareness, consciousness, and a fear of the reprogramming that awaits him back at the factory. With the help of a young woman, Number 5 tries to evade capture and convince his creator that he has truly become alive.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> Nova Robotics in Damon, Washington, has developed a new line of laser weapon-equipped robots called Strategic Artificially Intelligent Nuclear Transport (SAINT), which have tank-like tracks for movement. At a cost of $11 million each, five robots have been built, each capable of being parachuted into enemy territory and transporting a nuclear bomb into position. SAINT inventor Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenburg) envisioned the robots for non-military uses, but the military establishment sees them as the ""ultimate soldier"" that will follow orders without question.After the robots offer an impressive demonstration to military and government officials, a bolt of lightning hits the generator recharging robot Number Five. While Five initially seems to be fine, it quickly starts bumping into walls and malfunctioning. Five accidentally gets onto a garbage truck leaving the Nova Laboratories compound, but then falls off, landing in a pasture. When Nova officials discover Five is missing, Newton Crosby contacts it, but Five signals back, ""Malfunction. Need input."" Nova officials learn Five's whereabouts with a tracking device and send a team to get it. They are worried because Five's laser weapons are still operational. Nova head Howard Marner (Austin Pendleton) pleads they not destroy Five, but Nova's security chief, Chick Skroeder (G.W. Bailey), tells his men to use any means necessary to put it out of commission. Newton and his assistant, Ben Jabituya (Fisher Stevens), also search for the robot.Five maneuvers aimlessly, seeking ""input."" A security tank catches up as Five crosses a bridge over the Columbia River into Oregon. The tank rams Five and pushes it off the bridge. Five releases its parachute and, unbeknownst to the driver, Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy), lands on top of a ""Snack Shack"" natural foods truck.At home, Stephanie prepares dinner, but notices strange lights going off inside the truck. She finds Number Five, assumes it is an alien from outer space, and welcomes it to Earth. Five audibly responds, ""Malfunction. Need input."" Stephanie invites Five to come inside, but the robot does not understand. However, when she says, ""forward,"" Five comprehends and goes into the house. Five quickly reads every book she has, delighted to have ""input.""The next morning, Five is able to imitate the commercials and do impressions of the voices it heard on television. When Five accidentally falls off the rear deck of Stephanie's house, she sees its Nova Laboratories nameplate on its underside and realizes Five is a robot rather than an alien. She telephones Nova, saying she has one of their missing robots and asks about a reward. Nova officials say they will be right over, but in the meantime, she should stay away from Five as it is malfunctioning. Stephanie tells Five that help is coming and that it needs a ""tune-up."" Five recites the dictionary definition of ""tune-up,"" which includes the synonym, ""disassemble."" Five sees a grasshopper in the yard and tries to jump like it. However, Five lands atop the grasshopper, squashing it. Five asks her to fix the grasshopper and Stephanie explains death to the robot. Five gets upset realizing that death can also mean ""disassemble."" Panicking, the robot gets in Stephanie's food truck, quickly reads the instruction manual, and drives away. Stephanie jumps onto the truck as it pulls out. Five drives erratically, but Stephanie convinces it to stop just before it drives into the river. When Stephanie asks why Five drove off like that, the robot replies that Nova will disassemble him.When Newton Crosby arrives, Five conveys the message that it is alive and wants to survive. The security team shoots at Five. The robot returns their fire with laser beams, destroying many boats in the marina. Newton gets the security team to stop shooting and powers down the robot. As the security team takes Five away, Newton instructs his assistant, Ben, to go with them and be sure not to erase the robot's memory. However, once in the back of the van, Five powers itself back up and replaces its damaged arm. When Ben and the driver see Five operating again, they panic and abandon the van. Five drives away, removing the tracking device attached to it.That night, Five returns to Stephanie's house while she is taking a bath, insisting it is alive. She agrees to let the robot stay the night and later, the two dance together, Five imitating dance moves it observed while watching the movie Saturday Night Fever. The next morning, Stephanie's former boyfriend, Frank (Brian McNamara), arrives to collect the $25,000 reward for the robot. Five responds by disassembling Frank's Trans Am sports car. When Frank fires his shotgun at Five, the robot deflects the bullets and fires its lasers, chasing Frank away.As Newton Crosby searches for Five, Nova chief Howard Marner radios that Stephanie wants to meet with him. Newton goes to the Black Cat Inn, where Stephanie tries to convince him that Five is alive. Newton responds that the robot can seem lifelike, but it is malfunctioning. As they talk, Stephanie realizes that Nova operatives are in the restaurant, waiting to capture Five.Meanwhile, Five is hiding in the woods nearby when the other SAINT robots try to capture it. Five eludes them, then reprograms them to behave like screen comics The Three Stooges. Five goes to the Black Cat Inn and rescues Stephanie from the Nova security team. They drive away together, while the security team chases. They elude their pursuers, then return to the Black Cat Inn where Five kidnaps Newton Crosby. Five insists it is alive and refuses to allow Newton to reprogram it or even look at its wiring. Five says that it is wrong to kill or disassemble. Newton asks how Five knows that and performs various tests on Five, including a Rorschach test. As Five offers human-like responses, Newton is slowly swayed. Finally, when the scientist tells a joke, Five responds with laughter. Newton says that is a spontaneous emotional response and he is finally convinced the robot is alive.Nova security men arrive along with the Army, demanding the robot. They capture Newton and Stephanie, but Five hides in the van. As the men approach, Five dashes out the back and races across the desert. The Army shoots at the robot and a helicopter fires a bazooka at it, destroying it. Devastated by its ""death,"" Stephanie collapses and Newton tries to comfort her. Howard Marner is devastated by the loss of the valuable robot and fires both Newton Crosby and the security chief, Skroeder.As Stephanie and Newton drive away, Five climbs from beneath the flooring in back, explaining that it quickly assembled a duplicate robot out of spare parts in the back of van. Newton mentions they can hide out on the 40 acres of land he owns in Montana. Five takes the steering wheel and announces it wants a new name, suggesting ""Johnny Five"" would be good."

The Fly,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A brilliant but eccentric scientist begins to transform into a giant man/fly hybrid after one of his experiments goes horribly wrong. An eccentric scientist changes the world with his teleportation technology: when his experiment seems to be going well, Dr. Seth Brundle tests his machine on himself and he gets fused with the worst kind of pest on Planet Earth; The Fly. What is the price of a man playing God? Only Seth knows.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), a brilliant but eccentric scientist attempts to woo investigative journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) by offering her a scoop on his latest research in the field of matter transportation, which against all the expectations of the scientific establishment have proved successful. Up to a point. Brundle thinks he has ironed out the last problem when he successfully transports a living creature, but when he attempts to teleport himself a fly enters one of the transmission booths, and Brundle finds he is a changed man. This Science-Gone-Mad film is the source of the quotable quote ""Be afraid. Be very afraid.""—Mark Thompson <mrt@oasis.icl.co.uk> Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum)is a research scientist, employed by Bartok Sciences, who has invented ""Telepods""- two-matter transmission pods that teleport any object through space from one ""Telepod"" to the other ""Telepod"". But, it isn't until Seth meets journalist Veronica Quaife who inspires Seth to correct the system, that Seth achieves successful teleportation. But something goes horribly wrong when Seth uses himself as a guinea-pig in a matter transmission experiment, as he teleports himself, unaware his genes have been fused with a house fly that was trapped in the telepod with him. Seth now finds himself slowly transforming into a terrifying mutant creature known as ""Brundlefly"", fighting in a fierce battle as his mutated genes begins to take over.—Daniel Williamson Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a scientist working on teleportation. Just when he thinks he's ironed out the last bug in his system, the intervention of a common house fly turns Seth into a 6 foot insect. The transformation from man to fly is gradual but horrific, and is witnessed by Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) ; a reporter documenting Seth's story. Seth has some time to try to find a cure, but is there enough time...?—Rob Hartill Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a brillliant and eccentric inventor. At a party thrown by his financier, Bartok Industries, for the press, Brundle meets Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), a reporter for Particle Magazine. He invites her to come back to his apartment, where he shows her his latest invention: teleporter pods, or ""telepods,"" that disintegrate matter, transmit it across space, and then reintegrate it. She realizes this could be the invention of the century, and, over Seth's objections, goes to her boss and ex-lover, Stathis Borans (John Getz), to convince him to publish the story. Borans is uninterested, believing the whole thing to be a magic trick. Brundle comes to see her at work, and is relieved that Stathis didn't want to publish the story, because his telepods are not ready to be made public yet. Although they can transmit inanimate matter, it can't handle living things. He offers to let Veronica track his progress as he tries to work out the kinks, if she will wait to write the story until he is finished. She agrees.Veronica ends up spending much of her time at Seth's apartment while he works, and the two of them become more and more attracted to each other. He attempts to send a baboon through the telepods, but it is re-integrated inside out. Soon Veronica falls in love with Seth, and they make love. During the act, she makes an offhand remark about ""the flesh"" driving women crazy. This gives Seth the inspiration he needs: he will teach the computer to be ""driven crazy"" by flesh. Seth continues to work on the telepods while Veronica goes shopping for a gift for him. While shopping, she runs into Stathis again, who now believes that Seth's project is genuine and should be published.Back at Seth's apartment, Veronica watches as Seth puts a second baboon through the telepods, and this time the baboon comes through unharmed. As they prepare to celebrate, however, Veronica finds a package from Stathis. Inside is a design for a cover story on Seth. She runs back to his office to stop him from publishing prematurely, leaving Seth to celebrate alone. He gets drunk and becomes convinced that Veronica is resuming her relationship with Stathis. He decides to teleport himself, as a way to spite Veronica. However, a housefly inadvertently gets into the telepod with him. He teleports to the other pod, and emerges seemingly normal.Veronica comes back to him that night and they reconcile, but his journey through the telepods begins to show
some strange side effects. Thick, coarse hairs begin to grow on his back. He develops a intense craving for sugar, his body develops an almost instantly more athletic build, and his sexual stamina is seemingly endless. The sex alone begins to wear out Veronica. Seth suddenly believes that Veronica should go through the teleportation herself, perhaps in a bid to make her as virile as himself. She refuses and, in a sudden burst of uncharacteristic anger, Seth leaves in search of a woman who can keep up with him.At a seedy bar, he meets a woman named Tawny, and arm wrestles with another man to compete over who gets to take her home. Seth wins by breaking the other man's arm with his superhuman strength and because of a white secretion from his hands. After a night of sex and a demonstration of his invention, Tawny pours champagne on his skin, which severely irritates him. He then tries to get her to go through the telepods, but she refuses. Seth tells her not to be afraid, but at that moment Veronica arrives, saying, ""Be afraid. Be very afraid.""Tawny leaves, and Veronica confronts Seth about the changes she has seen in him. Not only is his back growing more hairs, but his face is breaking out in blisters. She then informs him that she had some of his back hairs analyzed, and that that are most likely insect hairs. Seth refuses to believe anything is wrong with him, and he kicks Veronica out of his apartment, his thought processes having become more scattered and irrational.In the bathroom later on, though, Seth does notice more severe changes to himself: his fingernails are falling off and his fingers drip more fluid. His face has more blisters and more of the thick hairs are growing there. He concludes, like Veronica, that something must have gone wrong when he went through the telepods. He checks the record of his teleportation, and his computer tells him that there was a ""secondary element"" in the pod with him, which he recognizes as a housefly. When he asks the computer what happened to the fly, it tells him that he and the fly have been spliced together into a single organism at a genetic and molecular level.A month goes by in which Seth and Veronica do not speak, but finally he contacts her and asks her to see him. When she arrives, she sees that he is frightened and heavily deteriorating. His face is lined with pockmarks, and he needs canes to walk. He has to wear gloves to keep from biting his fingernails off. He eats by vomiting corrosive enzymes onto his food and sucking up the dissolved remains. As they talk, his ear falls off. He refuses to take help from any professional doctors, not wanting to be a lab rat.Veronica goes to Stathis, hoping to find some way to help Seth. He warns her not to go back to him, fearing contagion, but then he asks to go ahead and visit him again to document what is happening, so Stathis can see and find a way to help. She returns to his apartment to find him crawling on the walls and ceiling, as he now realizes what is happening: he is turning into a human-fly hybrid he calls ""Brundlefly,"" and wants Veronica to document his metamorphosis. She records a video where Brundle demonstrates his new eating habits and brings it to Stathis, who watches it in horror. Veronica then shocks Stathis further by telling him she is pregnant with Seth's child.Stathis encourages her to talk to Seth before aborting the baby. When she sees him again, he has deteriorated even further. He no longer wears clothes, his skin has become swollen and lumpy, and more of his body parts have fallen off and he barely resembles his old self. He keeps the sloughed-off parts in a cabinet, dubbing it ""The Brundle Museum of Natural History"". He warns Veronica not to return, because his fly instincts are taking over and he will not be able to keep himself from hurting her. She leaves without telling him she is pregnant, and demands Stathis take her to a doctor for an immediate abortion. Seth overhears them talking, however, and follows them to the doctor's office, where he kidnaps her and takes her back home, asking her to have the baby as it may be the only thing left of his humanity. Veronica is too frightened, thinking there is some kind of monster growing inside her.Stathis follows them to Seth's apartment, armed with a shotgun, but Seth jumps down from the skylight, catching Stathis by surprise. Seeing that Stathis means to shoot him, Seth defends himself by vomiting his digestive enzyme on Stathis' left hand and right foot, melting both appendages and sending Stathis into a state of semi-conscious shock. He is about to vomit on Stathis' face and make him a meal when Veronica, who Seth has kept on the roof, intervenes. Seth lets Stathis live, but asks for Veronica's help to make him human again. When she asks him to explain, he shows her the plan he has created: he wants to use the telepods as a gene-splicer yet again, using them to fuse himself with Veronica and their unborn child, in the hopes that her untainted humanity will be enough to stop the metamorphosis. Veronica resists, but Seth tries to force her into it, saying, ""We'll be the ultimate family."" As she struggles to free herself from Seth's grip, she accidentally rips off his jaw, which sparks the final stages of Seth's transformation. His limbs shed the remainder of their human skin, revealing the insect body underneath. The rest of his face sloughs off to reveal a fly's head.The now completely transformed Brundlefly throws Veronica into one pod, activates the computer and steps into the other. As the countdown to teleportation ticks away, the wounded Stathis comes to his senses. With some effort, he uses his shotgun to shoot the cables connecting Veronica's telepod to the computer, forcing it offline and ensuring Veronica's safety. Brundlefly smashes the door to its telepod and attempts to escape, but the teleportation sequence begins as it is halfway out of the telepod. In a flash, a section of the telepod is transported to the third pod with Brundlefly, causing a shower of sparks. Stathis manages to crawl to Veronica's pod and let her out. The computer, in the meantime, fuses Brundlefly with the section of the telepod that it took. The receiving pod door opens, and Brundlefly collapses onto the floor. As a result of the fusion, most of its body is now a mangled, twisted mass of flesh and machinery.Brundlefly crawls toward Veronica, who arms herself with Stathis' shotgun. Rather than try to harm her, however, Brundlefly uses a claw to point the shotgun barrel at its own head, silently asking Veronica to end its life. She is unable to at first, but seeing that the creature which used to be her lover is horribly deformed and in excruciating pain, she gains enough strength to pull the trigger, blowing apart Brundlefly's head. She sobs, as the film fades out and the credits roll."
Hannah and Her Sisters,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091167/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Between two Thanksgivings two years apart, Hannah's husband falls in love with her sister Lee, while her hypochondriac ex-husband rekindles his relationship with her sister Holly. Hannah, Holly, and Lee are adult sisters from a show business family, their boozy actress mother who still believes she's an ingénue that can attract any man she wants, despite still being married to the girls' father, Evan. Hannah, on her second marriage to a man named Elliot, a financial advisor, is the success of the family, taking a break from her acting career to raise her children. Everyone turns to her for advice, while she never talks to others about what she needs or feels. Her first husband, Mickey, is a comedy show writer and hypochondriac, who is going through a crisis as he mistakenly believes he will die soon without a clear belief, as a non-practicing Jew, of what will happen to him in the afterlife. Single Holly is the insecure flaky sister, a struggling and thus continually unemployed actress, who has just started a catering business with her actress friend April, in order to do something constructive with her life. In her own security, Hannah even set up Holly and Mickey together following her own break-up with Mickey, Holly and Mickey's sole date which arguably was the worst night in both their lives. Holly turns to Hannah for everything in her life, including money, despite feeling Hannah overly judgmental about her failures. It's during a catering job that Holly and April meet David, an architect, who seems interested in both of them. Holly's insecurities may threaten her potential relationship with David and friendship with April. Lee, who collects unemployment, is metaphorically the family's piece of clay waiting for the right artist to mold her. She has long lived with artist Frederick, who has contempt for everyone except her, and as such relies on her for whatever his connection to the outside world. This already complex collective becomes even more complex when Elliot contemplates telling Lee that he has fallen in love with her. His attraction to her is as much feeling unneeded by Hannah, who he does not want to hurt regardless of what he decides to do with respect to Lee.—Huggo Three successive family Thanksgiving dinners mark time for Hannah, her younger sisters Lee and Holly, and the men in their lives. Lee is having an affair with Hannah's husband Elliot,and trying to end her Svengali-like romance with artist Frederick. Holly is frustrated by her lack of career fulfillment and her increasing dependence on Hannah's largesse, while being courted by hypochondriac Mickey.—Jwelch5742 The story is told in three main arcs, with almost all of it occurring during a 12-month period beginning and ending at Thanksgiving parties hosted by Hannah (Mia Farrow) and her husband, Elliot (Michael Caine). Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; her own story as a successful actress (a recent success as Nora in A Doll's House) is somewhat secondary, but most of the events of the film connect to her.An adulterous romance between Elliot and one of Hannah's sisters, Lee (Barbara Hershey), provides the main romantic entanglement of the film. Elliot's discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength causes him to look elsewhere. Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick (Max von Sydow). She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her. She leaves Frederick, much to his sorrow (for he has grown dependent upon her), and has a secret affair with Elliot lasting for several months.Mickey, another of Allen's neurotic characters, provides the comic relief. Parts of his story are scenes from his previous marriage to Hannah and his horrible date with the cocaine-addicted Holly (Hannah's other sister, played by Wiest), shown in flashbacks. Mickey's main story is one of a hypochondriac confronting the possibility of an actual serious disease. After a clean bill of health, it turns into a career-pausing existential crisis, and leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to Catholicism and Krishna Consciousness, before a long walk and the fortuitous opportunity to see again the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup (part of the 'joyous' declaration of war sequence is featured) help to remind him why life is worth living. The revelation helps prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms quickly (and mostly off-screen) into a relationship and marriage.Holly's story is the film's third main arc. She's an unsuccessful actress who dabbles in a catering business, funded by Hannah, but competing with April (Carrie Fisher), her business partner and a fellow actress for acting parts and a man (Sam Waterston) ends with Holly losing both. She decides to try her hand at writing. The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency Hannah perhaps welcomes and Holly resents. After writing a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot (a story that Holly sets aside after Hannah objects to just how much of the couple's private life Holly had incorporated into it), she writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced.A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan (played by Maureen O'Sullivan and Lloyd Nolan, who were both in Never Too Late 20 years earlier). They are Hannah's parents, who still have acting careers of their own, careers disrupted at times by Norma's alcoholism. Evan's flirtation and piano playing provide part of the entertainment during the Thanksgiving get-togethers.By the time of the film's second Thanksgiving Lee has ended her affair with Elliot. In a final coda-like act, another year has elapsed and the film ends happily for the three sisters, now all married, and infertile Mickey has somehow impregnated his new wife Holly.Part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from Ingmar Bergman's Fanny and Alexander. In both films, a large theatrical family gather for three successive year's celebrations (Thanksgiving in Allen's film, Christmas in Bergman's). The first of each gathering is in a time of contentment, the second in a time of trouble, and the third after the resolution of the troubles. The sudden appearance of Holly's reflection behind Mickey's in the closing scene also parallels the apparition behind Alexander of the Bishop's ghost."
Three Amigos!,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092086/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three actors accept an invitation to a Mexican village to perform their onscreen bandit fighter roles, unaware that it is the real thing. Three out of work silent movie actors are accidentally drawn to a Mexican village that is being harassed by a gang of outlaws. The three, 'Ned', 'Lucky Day' and 'Dusty Bottoms' play 'Lone Ranger' types in their movies, but must play their parts for real now.—Rob Hartill When silent film stars Lucky Day, Dusty Bottoms and Ned Nederlander get fired, they take a job offer from Mexico: Doing a show with El Guapo, supposedly the most famous actor there. Traveling there in hope of getting good money, they arrive only to learn soon that El Guapo is not an actor, but a cruel gang leader suppressing people. He abducts the mayor's beautiful daughter Carmen (to be his wife) in revenge for the people's cry for help. Now, all hopes of the village folks rest on the weak shoulders of three minor-talented actors, who can't just walk off the set this time.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> In 1916, the notorious bandit El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his gang of thugs are collecting protection money from the small Mexican village of Santo Poco. Carmen (Patrice Martinez), daughter of the village leader, searches for someone who can come to the rescue of her townspeople. While visiting a small village church, she remains to watch a silent film featuring ""The Three Amigos"" and, believing them to be real heroes, sends a telegram to Hollywood asking them to come and stop El Guapo. However, the telegraph operator edits her message down since she has very little money to pay for it.Meanwhile, Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase), and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) are Hollywood silent film actors who portray the heroic Amigos on screen. When they demand a salary increase, studio boss Harry Flugleman (Joe Mantegna) fires them and evicts them from their studio-owned housing. Shortly afterward, they receive Carmen's telegram, but misinterpret it as an invitation to make a film with El Guapo. After breaking into the studio to retrieve their costumes, the Amigos head for Mexico.Stopping at a cantina near Santo Poco, they are mistaken for associates of a fast-shooting German pilot (Kai Wulff), who is also looking for El Guapo and who arrived just before they did. A relieved Carmen picks up the Amigos and takes them to the village, where they are put up in the best house in town and treated very well. The next morning, when three of El Guapo's men come to raid the village, the Amigos do a Hollywood-style stunt show that leaves them very confused. The bandits ride off, making everyone think that the Amigos have defeated the enemy; in reality, the men inform El Guapo of what has happened, and he decides to return in force the next day and kill the Amigos.As the German's real associates arrive at the cantina, proving themselves just as adept with pistols as he is, the village throws a boisterous celebration for the Amigos and their (supposed) victory. The next morning, El Guapo and his gang come to Santo Poco and call out the Amigos, who confess that they have only been acting and are too scared to confront him after Lucky gets shot in the arm. El Guapo allows his men to loot the village and kidnaps Carmen, and the Amigos leave Santo Poco in disgrace. With nothing waiting for them back home, Ned persuades Lucky and Dusty to become real-life heroes and go after El Guapo.Their first attempt to find his hideout fails, but they spot a cargo plane and follow it to him; the plane is flown by the German, who has brought a shipment of rifles for the gang with his associates' help. Preparations are underway for El Guapo's 40th birthday party, and he plans to make Carmen his bride. The Amigos try to sneak into the hideout, with mixed results: Lucky is captured and chained up in a dungeon, Dusty crashes through a window and into Carmen's room, and Ned ends up stuck in the pinata.As Lucky frees himself and Dusty sneaks out only to be caught, Ned falls loose and is also captured. The German, having idolized Ned's quick-draw and gun-spinning pistol skills since childhood, challenges him to a shootout. Ned wins, killing the German, and Lucky holds El Guapo at gunpoint long enough for Carmen and the Amigos to escape - first on horseback, then in the German's plane. Returning to Santo Poco with El Guapo's entire army in pursuit, they rally the villagers to stand up for themselves and plan a defense. The bandits arrive in the seemingly empty village, only to find themselves suddenly being shot at by Amigos from all sides and falling into hidden water-filled trenches dug by the villagers. Eventually all of El Guapo's men either desert him or die in the gunfire, and he takes a fatal wound as well. As he lies dying, the villagers - all armed and wearing replicas of the Amigos' costumes - step out to confront him. El Guapo congratulates them on this plan, then shoots Lucky in the foot and dies.The villagers offer to give the Amigos all the money they have, but the Amigos refuse it, saying (as in their movies) that seeing justice done is enough of a reward for them. They then ride off into the sunset, ready to continue being real heroes."
Little Shop of Horrors,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091419/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A nerdy florist finds his chance for success and romance with the help of a giant man-eating plant who demands to be fed. Seymour Krelborn is a nerdy orphan working at Mushnik's, a flower shop in urban Skid Row. He harbors a crush on fellow co-worker Audrey Fulquard, and is berated by Mr. Mushnik daily. One day as Seymour is seeking a new mysterious plant, he finds a very mysterious unidentified plant which he calls Audrey II. The plant seems to have a craving for blood and soon begins to sing for his supper. Soon enough, Seymour feeds Audrey's sadistic dentist boyfriend to the plant and later, Mushnik for witnessing the death of Audrey's ex. Will Audrey II take over the world or will Seymour and Audrey defeat it?—HannahMontaniwitz Shy amateur botanist Seymour (Rick Moranis) tinkers his nights away in the basement of Mushnik's failing Flower Shop, hoping to create a fetching plant hybridization that will save the 'skid row' business on skids (and his much-needed job). His only other work perk is working alongside floral designer Audrey (Ellen Greene), a lovely girl that looks for love but lands a sadist - Orin Scrivello, DDS (Steve Martin). Seymour's salvation falls to earth in the form of a man-eating plant from outer space - Audrey II - with the power to give poor Seymour everything he lacks in life. When Audrey II's appetite becomes insatiable, Seymour must choose between the high life or the high road. Featuring Tisha Campbell in her film debut and Steve Martin in one of his most iconic performances, alongside appearances from Jim Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Guest, and Bill Murray with Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops voicing Audrey II.—Mae Moreno Seymour, an orphan and a nerd, is taken in and given a job by Mr. Mushnik, the owner of a run down Florists in the seedy part of town. Seymour spends his time doing menial tasks and dreaming of the shop assistant, Audrey. One day, just after an eclipse of the Sun, Seymour discovers a strange plant. He buys it and names is Audrey II. While caring for Audrey II, Seymour discovers the plant's rather unique appetite. The plant grows and grows, as does Seymour's infatuation for Audrey, but who will get her first? FEED ME!—Mark Harding <mah@imdb.com> The narrator (Stanley Jones) tells of an event that once threatened the existence of the entire human race. It occurred in ""the most seemingly innocent and unlikely of places"", Skid Row, in New York. Three teenage girls (Michelle Weeks, Tisha Campbell-Martin, and Tichina Arnold) appear throughout the film as a Motown-singing Greek chorus. They set the scene at the unassuming Mushnick's Flower Shop (""Little Shop of Horrors"").Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis), the meek, clumsy employee of Mr. Mushnick (Vincent Gardenia), lives a dreary life among the other unfortunate residents of Skid Row (""Skid Row/Downtown""). Taken in by Mushnick as a young orphan, Seymour lives in a tiny room below the flower shop and is treated fairly poorly by his employer. The light of his life is his co-worker, Audrey (Ellen Greene), a fragile, battered woman stuck in an abusive relationship. The flower shop is making virtually no money, and Mr. Mushnick is on the verge of closing it for good when Audrey mentions the strange and interesting new plant Seymour has been developing, and suggests that if it is properly advertised, it might attract more business. Seymour presents the plant, a large bud surrounded by layers of leaves. Mushnick is pleasantly surprised when customers begin flocking in after seeing the little plant in the window. Seymour has no idea what kind of plant it is, but explains how he got it (""Da Doo""): While he was shopping for odd new plants, his hobby, a solar eclipse occurred. After daylight returned, the strange plant seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Seymour bought it for cheap and brought it home to examine. He shyly admits that he named it ""Audrey II.""The shop is doing record business until the plant begins to wither. Seymour frantically tries to nurse it back to health, though water, sunlight, fertilizer, and minerals have done no good (""Grow For Me""). When he pricks his finger on a rose thorn and draws blood, Audrey II responds vigorously. Seymour realizes what it lives on, and reluctantly gives it a few drops. Audrey II has a dramatic growth spurt and business picks up, with Seymour becoming a local celebrity (""Some Fun Now""). He does not reveal the secret behind the plant's health.Audrey's boyfriend, Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin), is a sadistic dentist with a leather jacket, motorcycle, and ducktail haircut. He adores his profession because of the constant opportunities to inflict pain on others (""Dentist!""). He enhances his pleasure through his habit of huffing nitrous oxide, or ""giggle gas"", for a euphoric high. Seymour and Mushnick are concerned, as Audrey often comes to work with injuries or a black eye. Orin arrives at the shop one night to pick up Audrey, and Seymour sees first hand how roughly he treats her. Audrey, meanwhile, secretly dreams of an idyllic suburban life with Seymour (""Somewhere That's Green""), but is too frightened to leave Orin.Seymour angrily paces around the empty shop at night, venting his frustrations to Audrey II, who is now roughly the size of an armchair. To Seymour's great surprise, Audrey II responds with a human voice (Levi Stubbs) and demands more food. Knowing that the plant can no longer live on mere droplets of blood (partially because it is too big, and partially because Seymour is now weak and anemic from feeding the plant from his bleeding fingers), Seymour is reluctant to provide it with bigger portions. The smooth-talking Audrey II promises Seymour money, fame, and the girl of his dreams if he continues to nourish it with human blood (""Feed Me (Git It)""). Seymour initially refuses to murder for the benefit of Audrey II, reasoning that he doesn't know anyone ""who deserves to get chopped up and fed to a hungry plant."" Audrey II directs him to the window, where he sees Orin assaulting Audrey across the street. Filled with rage, Seymour agrees to bring back a specific meal for the plant.The next day, Seymour goes to Orin's office with a gun in his coat pocket. The patient before him, Arthur Denton (Bill Murray) is a gleeful masochist who frustrates Orin by actually enjoying the oral torture he receives. After Denton's departure, Orin drags Seymour into his office to get the sadistic fix he had been craving. Though he wants to spare Audrey further pain and has promised Audrey II fresh blood, Seymour is terrified of shooting Orin. Conveniently, Orin dons his special gas mask, which provides him with constant nitrous oxide and increases his sadistic pleasure. The mask malfunctions and Seymour watches his nemesis asphyxiate before his eyes. Seymour drags the body back to the flower shop, where he reluctantly chops it up with an axe and feeds it piece by piece to Audrey II.Seymour is understandably shaken by the incident, and sees the police speaking with Audrey the next morning about Orin's disappearance. He tries to comfort Audrey, telling her that she had deserved a better man all along. While Audrey admits that her low self-esteem kept her tied to Orin, she feels partially responsible for his fate because she had been silently wishing him out of her life. Though he does not reveal the truth about what became of Orin, Seymour promises to stand by Audrey no matter what (""Suddenly Seymour"").Invigorated from finally winning Audrey's love, Seymour returns to the flower shop. He is confronted by Mushnick, who had seen Seymour dismembering Orin's body the night before. Mushnick assumes that Seymour's devotion to Audrey caused him to murder the cruel dentist, but does not suspect that Audrey II is involved, and knows nothing of its grisly diet. Mushnick leads Seymour upstairs at gunpoint, planning to turn him in to the police. He then offers Seymour a proposition: Seymour leaves town forever, and Mushnick keeps the money-making plant. As Audrey II coaxes Seymour to sacrifice Mushnick to clear his own name (""Suppertime""), Seymour nervously backs Mushnick into the gaping maw of the hungry plant, killing two birds with one stone.With Audrey II grown to enormous proportions, Seymour's celebrity increases (""The Meek Shall Inherit""). However, he is miserable and terrified of the plant's eating habits getting out of hand. He begins to fend off the media and turn down large sums of money, feeling guilty for his part in the secret deaths of Audrey II's meals. He finally puts his foot down, denying the plant any further feedings. He and Audrey plan to run away that night and get married, escaping Skid Row forever. However, he buckles when Audrey II seemingly agrees to accept some meat from the butcher instead of a human corpse. Seymour falls for the ruse and leaves the shop. The plant, with its fully mobile tendrils, uses the phone to call Audrey's apartment across the street, begging for water. Audrey, in her wedding dress, comes to oblige, and is amazed that the huge plant can talk. As she fetches the watering can, the plant wraps its vines around her legs and drags her into its mouth (""Suppertime II"").Seymour returns just in time to save Audrey from being devoured. Outside the shop, he explains how dangerous the plant is, and how he only kept it because he thought Audrey would cease to like him if he were no longer rich and famous. Audrey assures Seymour that she loved him from the moment she met him, and still does. They are interrupted by a salesman (James Belushi) who shares with Seymour his idea of collecting trimmings from the plant and marketing miniature Audrey IIs all over the country. Seymour deducts that this was the plant's plan all along: It was an alien that came to earth during the solar eclipse and was bent on world domination. He rushes back into the shop for a final showdown with Audrey II. The plant thwarts Seymour's efforts at killing it, and begins to taunt him as its branches destroy the building and new buds begin to bloom (""Mean Green Mother from Outer Space""). Emerging from the rubble, Seymour grabs a live electric wire and touches it to Audrey II's vine, electrocuting it and causing it to explode into nothing.Seymour and Audrey are married and arrive at their suburban dream home, just as Audrey had imagined. As they enter the front door, a baby Audrey II plant is seen in their garden, a tiny smile on its pod."

In Victorian London, England, a little mouse girl's toymaker father is abducted by a peglegged bat. She enlists the aid of Basil of Baker Street, the rodent world's answer to Sherlock Holmes. The case expands as Basil uncovers the crime's link to a plot against the Crown itself.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> Set in 1897 London, England.

When a young female mouse named Olivia informs Basil about her father's abduction, the detective becomes determined to bring Ratigan to justice. Basil soon gets help from Dr. David Q. Dawson and Toby, a smart yet resourceful dog owned by Sherlock Holmes, in order to stop Ratigan once and for all, who plans on overthrowing the mouse queen during her annual jubilee.—dawsonpersi The clues are in, the chase is on, and the case of the century is about to break wide open in Disney's greatest little mystery in history. Let the creators of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid take you on an adventuresome journey through the cobblestone streets of 1897 London, where some suspicious ""mousechief"" is the suspenseful start to this thrilling musical adventure. Olivia, the brave daughter of a beloved London toymaker, turns to Basil of Baker Street for help with her father's disappearance. Basil's jolly assistant, Dr. Dawson, and loyal dog Toby lend a hand ... and nose ... as they sniff out clues through their charming miniature world. The final chase leads to Professor Ratigan (voiced by Vincent Price), a hard-hearted criminal whom Basil must outwit to save all of Mousedom.—Disney The year is 1897. The place is London. The setting is not our world, but the world of England's mouse population, who live lives not so different from ours, in the mouse holes and basements of the British Empire.Hiram Flaversham, a master toymaker, is kidnapped on his daughter Olivia's birthday. The young girl has no one to turn to for help, so she strikes out on her own, seeking the greatest detective in all mousedom, Basil of Baker Street.En route, Olivia encounters Dr. David Q. Dawson, a mouse recently returned from military duty in Afghanistan. The kindly doctor agrees to accompany the girl in search of Basil.They manage to find his rooms at 221 1/2 Baker Street (in the basement of a very famous address), and the mouse himself soon makes his appearance. Basil is a bundle of energy, running around the flat, ignoring his two visitors, in anticipation of bringing his latest case to a successful conclusion with an experiment in ballistics. Alas, the experiment is a failure, and the detective is thrown into a deep depression, still unwilling to help poor Olivia.When the girl mentions that her father was kidnapped by a peg-legged bat, however, Basil is again galvanized into action. This bat, Fidget, is a thug employed by his arch-nemesis, Professor Ratigan!Ratigan is the worst criminal in London, a veritable Napoleon of Crime. Even as Basil recounts his previous battles with Ratigan, the crimelord is deep in the sewers of London, forcing his victim Flaversham to build some diabolical device. What is Ratigan planning? Nothing less than the demise of the Queen on the day of her Diamond Jubilee and his own ascension to the throne!Ratigan's henchmen sing his praises, but their boss shows his true colors when one besotted mouse forgets himself and sings out, ""Ratigan, the world's greatest rat."" Outraged at being called a rat, although he clearly is one, the professor summons his own personal enforcer: an obese cat named Felicia, who keeps the minions in line and eats those who run afoul of Ratigan's temper.Back in Baker Street, Basil agrees to take the case, and attempts to deduce Ratigan's motive in kidnapping a toymaker, when his cogitations are interrupted by the selfsame Fidget spying in the window!Instantly, Basil is after the villain, with Dawson reluctantly in tow, but all they find are peg-legged footprints and the bat's cap. For a detective of Basil's caliber, these clues are more than enough, and he is off to find the kidnapped Flaversham. Basil wheedles Dr. Dawson into enlisting as his assistant, and little Olivia tags along, too, much to Basil's disgust.The threesome make their way to the human residence above, where they find Toby, a huge hound...well, huge in comparison to a bunch of mice. Toby's keen nose picks up the scent from the dropped cap, and he is swiftly on the trail, a trail that leads to a human's toy shop. Basil skulks about in search of Fidget and finds some puzzling clues: toy soldiers without their uniforms and wind-up toys with all the gears missing.While the detective ponders these clues, Fidget strikes! He stuffs Olivia into a sack and attacks Basil and Dawson with a succession of giant toys, finally escaping through the skylight a hairsbreadth ahead of Basil.Fortunately, Fidget has dropped another clue in the form of a list given to him by Ratigan. Basil's knowledge of chemistry enables him to analyze the paper, finding traces of brandy, coal and seawater, which lead him to deduce that the note came from a seedy pub located where the sewer connects to the riverfront.Basil is also a master of disguise, and he swiftly outfits himself and the protesting doctor as sailors. Together they infiltrate the Rat Trap, a disreputable pub filled with low-life ruffians, just the place to search for one of Ratigan's minions.They do find Fidget, and follow him through the sewer to Ratigan's secret lair, where they spy Olivia held captive inside a huge bottle. While attempting to free her, however, Basil and Dawson are surprised by Professor Ratigan's entire gang, who were just waiting for him to arrive. It's a trap, and Basil fell for it!Delighted at having his greatest enemy in his clutches, the flamboyant Ratigan must destroy the detective in some spectacular way. So, he has Basil and Dawson tied to a mousetrap which will snap when a metal ball drops onto the trigger. Not content with this, Ratigan has set the snap of the mousetrap to fire a gun and a crossbow at the unlucky pair, which will in turn cause an axe to chop them to bits, which will bring an anvil down on whatever is left of the great mouse detective, with a rigged camera to record the results. The entire trap is set in motion when a record of Ratigan's song plays to the end, pulling a string that releases the fatal ball.Alas, Ratigan must away to Buckingham Palace, taking his prisoners and his gang with him, so he provides a camera to automatically record the death of Basil for posterity.Mortified at being outwitted, Basil is once more plunged into depression and puts up no resistance, not so much as attempting to think of a way out of the trap. Dawson's tries to encourage him otherwise, but finally loses his temper at Basil's whining noting that they and the British Empire are in peril while Basil wallows in self-pity. At that, Dawson snaps if Basil has given up, then they are might as well set the death trap off now and get it over with. At that last remark, Basil realizes to his delight the way to escape: setting off the trap now. Although Dawson is alarmed at this suicidal option, Basil works out a complicated but ingenious solution. Their only chance is for Basil and Dawson to snap the mousetrap themselves at just the right moment. The trap clamps down on the metal ball, thus protecting the pair from being caught in its powerful jaws. Moreover, the pressure pops off the mousetrap's hinge, which knocks the gun aside, which shoots the crossbow, which deflects the arrow, which shoots the axe, which comes down between Basil and Dawson, which cuts them free just in time to avoid being splatted by the anvil. In the shockwave of the impact, Olivia is jarred out of the battle she is trapped in and caught by Basil who also grabs Dawson for the photo now marking the detective's triumphant thwarting of the deathtrap.Basil is himself again, ready to tackle Ratigan once more, but first not forgetting to pose for the professor's camera. Toby carries Basil, Dawson and Olivia to the palace, where Ratigan's lackeys, dressed in uniforms stolen from the soldier dolls at the toy shop, have already captured the mouse queen. Basil arrives in the nick of time and pulls Her Majesty from Felicia's waiting jaws.Meanwhile, Ratigan has substituted a mechanical queen for the real sovereign, a machine built by master toymaker Flaversham. This clock-work queen appoints none other than Professor Ratigan as her royal consort, giving the fiend control over the entire British Empire! But Basil soon intervenes, capturing Ratigan's henchmen and exposing the villain for what he truly is: a slimy, contemptible sewer rat!The jig is up, and Ratigan flees with the faithful Fidget and with Olivia as his hostage in his monogrammed, bicycle-powered dirigible. Toby makes short work of Felicia as Basil rigs up a pursuit vehicle out of a Union Jack, a matchbox and a bunch of balloons. He chases Ratigan across the London skies, and the fiendish professor attempts to lighten his own load by tossing Fidget overboard! But he can't escape Basil, who fearlessly leaps onto the dirigible. Suddenly, the Houses of Parliament loom ahead. Basil and his enemy crash into the face of the famous London landmark, the clock commonly known as Big Ben.Inside the tower, Basil and Ratigan battle on the huge mechanism, where any false step could crush them between the meshing gears. Ratigan is much bigger and more powerful, and Basil just manages to scoop up Olivia and head for safety atop the tower. But Ratigan's rage at being thwarted once again causes him to snap. He rips his clothes to shreds and stands revealed as a fierce and deadly rat!Olivia is safely aboard the balloon, but Ratigan tackles Basil and the two go tumbling down to land on the hands of the great clock. The detective is battered mercilessly until he finds himself hanging by his fingernails on the edge of oblivion. The evil Professor Ratigan has won, but wait! He hasn't been paying attention to the time. But Basil has, and he watches with satisfaction as the vibrations from the chiming of the bell when the clock strikes the hour send Ratigan over the edge. At the last moment, the villain manages to pull Basil down with him.Anxiously, Basil's friends watch both detective and crimelord plunge into the fog to the river far below. It looks hopeless, but the remarkable Basil is able to use the propeller from the dirigible to save himself, creating a pedal-powered helicopter that lifts him to safety.The empire is saved, Olivia is reunited with her father, and Basil invites Dr. Dawson to be his partner in crime-detection. As a tearful new client appears at 221 1/2 Baker Street, bringing a new case with new adventures, we take our leave of Basil of Baker Street, the Great Mouse Detective."

When Danny searches the apartment, nothing turns up, and the officers cannot make an arrest. Danny goes out on Snake's balcony, and announces to nearby basketball players that Snake's apartment has poor locks, and $50,000 for the taking.

Logan announces that Gonzales is back on the street thanks to his lawyer. The partners are eager to apprehend Gonzales and return to work. They get a tip that he may be living with his girl friend at the El Camino apartments.As Ray and Danny drive to the location, they recognize Gonzales's Mercedes. Ray takes a can of red spray paint and creates a no-parking zone around the car, and it is towed. Soon, they have a standoff with four of Gonzales's men.

When he sees Danny and Ray, he escapes in a limousine, leaving the nun and priest behind. Ray and Danny give the priest and nun a ride, and a chase ensues. Gonzales's limousine drives onto the elevated railroad tracks and the police taxicab barely misses crashing into an oncoming train. The chase continues until Gonzales's limousine stops for another oncoming train. Gonzales jumps out and disappears into the station just as the train upends his limousine.Back at the station, the partners apologize, saying they mistook the priest and nun to be cocaine smugglers for Gonzales. They cannot find drugs inside the ceramic souvenirs in their suitcases, and the nun and priest are released. Ray and Danny soon realize that the ceramic containers themselves are made of pressed cocaine, and tell the captain. Later, the partners harass Juan Martinez to get new information about Gonzales's whereabouts.On their stakeout, Gonzales arranges for a trash compactor truck to destroy their taxicab with them in it after they refuse to return the drugs in exchange for a bribe that would cover a mortgage for their Key West bar. The partners escape through the back window, only to discover that Gonzales is gone. The next day, they retrieve Gonzales's Mercedes from the impound yard, and drive around town looking for him.

Danny's elevator door opens but Anna's remains shut. He orders her to climb out the top and jump over to his elevator but she is afraid to move. He throws bags of cocaine in the air, and Gonzales is frantic as they burst on the lobby floor. Danny catches Anna and they escape. Ray shoots his way past Gonzales's men and swings onto firm ground. The partners fire away at Gonzales and he goes down. Ray and Danny argue over who fired the fatal shot, but Gonzales pops up again. After another round of shooting, Gonzales collapses dead on a down escalator, and his bloody body lands on the lobby floor. Anna hugs Danny and smothers him with kisses.Danny and Ray agree that the people of Chicago deserve good protection and Frank and Tony could use more seasoning. At this, Danny turns to the rookies and asks if anyone wants to buy his bar."

Also worthy of note are the comical builders and Anna's terrible ex-husband Max who wants her back.—Rob Hartill A young couple sinks their life savings into a house that is falling apart to the extent that it no longer has a main stairway or water. This creates strains on their relationship. Every homeowner will recognize some of the situations they encounter.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> After receiving wedding pictures from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, entertainment attorney Walter Fielding (Tom Hanks) complains to his girl friend, concert musician Anna Crowley (Shelley Long), about his newly married scofflaw father, Walter, Sr. (Douglass Watson). His father might be starting a new life, but he stole the firm's money and ran away to Brazil, and left him and the law firm in debt.The next morning, Walter comments that his father's much younger Filipino new wife, Florinda (Tetchie Agbayani), looks underage. When Anna tells him not to be so conventional, he admits he wants a house in the suburbs, and a wife. When he asks Anna to marry him, she asks for more time to make her decision. Her first marriage to Russian music conductor, Max Beissart (Alexander Godunov), was a disaster, and she is not in a rush to marry again. Suddenly, her former husband's associate, Shatov (Yakov Smirnoff), barges into the bedroom and informs Anna that ""Maestro"" is returning home, and reclaiming his luxury apartment.Walter and Anna are both broke, and cannot afford to relocate elsewhere in New York City. They decide to contact their friend, real estate broker Jack Schnittman (Josh Mostel), for help. Meanwhile, Max conducts his first rehearsal back in town, and criticizes the orchestra for their mediocre performance.While jogging, Jack Schnittman proposes that Walter gather $200,000 in cash by the end of business Friday because the owners of a $1 million property are willing to sell for less. Walter is suspicious, but feels pressured, and agrees to consider the deal. At dinner, Max tells Anna his life is meaningless without her, and he wants to get back together. Anna insists she loves Walter, and Max only loves himself.Anna goes with Walter to inspect the house Jack recommended. The owner, Estelle (Maureen Stapleton), shows them the property, and explains that Israeli Intelligence arrested her longtime husband, Carlos, for being Hitler's ""pool man."" If Estelle can sell the property and the furnishings, she might raise enough money to pay the lawyers. Walter and Anna want time to make a decision, but Estelle claims that Carlos is facing extradition, and she must sell immediately. She offers to include an antique Lincoln car in the deal. Walter cannot resist a bargain and convinces Anna to buy the house. She sells valuables from her divorce to raise her share of the money. Walter persuades his client, a successful boy singer named Benny (Billy Lombardo), to loan him the $200,000 in cash to pay for the new house.As soon as Walter and Anna move in, their house falls apart. When the front door is stuck shut, Walter receives an electrical shock as he rings the doorbell. Upstairs, Anna tries out the four-poster bed they acquired with the house, and becomes trapped when the mattress collapses around her. When Walter knocks to get Anna's attention, the front door falls down. He turns his attention to repairing the staircase, but his hammering loosens the ceiling plaster upstairs.In the bathroom, Anna is revolted when she turns on the bathtub faucet, and gooey, rusty water spurts out. Walter assures her that all houses need maintenance, and encourages her to be more positive. As Anna hangs her clothes in the bedroom closet, the rod and shelving collapse. Outside, Walter repairs the front door. He tests it three times and goes inside, but within seconds, the door frame separates from the structure, falling to the ground.Upstairs, when Anna pulls the dumbwaiter ropes, a raccoon emerges and attacks. Walter hears Anna's screams, but as he races up the staircase, it collapses around him. Walter is convinced the house is ""a lemon,"" and that Estelle swindled them into buying that faulty house, but Anna will not let him quit. However, a rainstorm reveals that there are several leaks in the roof.The next morning, a carpenter named Art Shirk (Joe Mantegna) arrives to do an estimate on a new staircase, and declares that the front door has dry rot. Art's plumber brother, Brad (Carmine Caridi), arrives, and insists on a $5,000 upfront check without even inspecting the house. He claims to have seen the house several years earlier, and does not expect the plumbing problems have been resolved. Later, electrical fires occur when too many appliances are used. The blender and the popcorn popper explode, and the stove doors burst open. The turkey is propelled out one window and bursts through a second floor bathroom window. As Anna and Walter pour buckets of lukewarm water in the bathtub, the rotting floor gives way, and it crashes onto the floor below.The next day, Brad Shirk's foreman, Curly (Philip Bosco), arrives with a crew that looks like a gang of Hell's Angels. Curly encourages Walter and Anna to leave while they work on the house. Walter returns to find piles of debris everywhere after the group had trashed the house even more. Since Walter was not available to sign building permits, Curly and his crew went as far as they could. He promises to return when Walter has his permits approved. The ""permit man,"" Mr. Shrapp, agrees to return if Walter pays a cash bribe. Soon, Walter falls into a hole in the floor concealed by a throw rug. Mr. Shrapp arrives, and believes he hears Walter laughing instead of answering the door. Angered by Walter's rudeness, Mr. Shrapp rips up the permits and leaves. Anna calls Walter to be picked up at the train station, but he cannot answer the phone. She hitches a ride with a truck driver, and finds Walter stuck in the floor. When she attempts to rescue him, he plummets to the floor below. That evening, when Walter puts another log in the fireplace, the chimney comes crashing down, and snuffs out the fire.Four months later, the house is still under repair as a more competent work crew fixes all the damages and patches up the holes in the floor, walls, and ceiling. Walter complains that Curly estimated the job would be done in two weeks. However, things are looking up. A new staircase and running water in the kitchen are the latest improvements, but accidents continue to occur.At an orchestra rehearsal, Max persuades Anna to have dinner at his apartment. Although she claims she will not sleep with him, they drink too much, and in the morning, Max tells her they made love, and she is consumed with guilt. Later, Anna tells Walter that Max took orchestra members to dinner after a brilliant rehearsal. When Walter wants to know if she spent the night with Max, Anna insists he will have to trust her. They argue as Anna lies about her indiscretion. When she finally confesses, Walter spends the night downstairs.In the morning, the fight continues. Walter want to kick her out of the house and refund her money. The workers listen in as she claims the house belongs to her just as much as it belongs to him. Finally, they agree to stay together until the repairs are done, sell the house, divide the money, and split. Anna retreats to the bedroom and sobs.Later, Max makes a surprise visit, and learns that Anna and Walter have decided to break up. He suggests that Anna should rekindle their relationship, but that is not part of her plan. Max confesses they did not sleep together, but lied to sabotage her relationship with Walter. When he sees how much she actually cares for Walter, Max decides to play matchmaker. He warns that it would be a mistake for Walter to throw away his relationship with Anna.Another few days later, when the house is finally renovated and restored, Walter and Anna are confused about where to take their relationship. Walter confesses he will get over Anna's one-night stand with Max. Anna tears up as she reveals she never slept with Max. They fall into each other's arms and kiss. Anna and Walter throw a wedding in their new home and Max conducts a full orchestra as part of the entertainment. Despite the repairs to restore their new house cost more than the $200,000 in cash that they used to purchase it, Walter and Anna are finally happy and that their ""money pit"" of a house is finally livable and everything is great.In Rio de Janeiro, the crafty con artist Estelle and her partner-in-crime Carlos (John van Dreelen) resurface where they offer to sell a house to Walter, Sr. insisting it must be a cash deal... and the vicious cycle is about to start all over again."
Gung Ho,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091159/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a Japanese car company buys an American plant, the American liaison must mediate the clash of work attitudes between the foreign management and native labor. Hunt Stevenson works for a large car manufacturer that has just been bought out by a Japanese firm. Suddenly finding himself having to justify his own job, he's forced to choose between redundancy or the seemingly inhuman Japanese work ethic that the new owners have brought with them.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> In a town in rural Pennsylvania, the car factory has been shut down, leaving the town economically distressed. A Japanese company, Assan Motors, has purchased the factory, but will need to be convinced that it is worth re-opening. Hunt Stevenson goes to Japan to make a presentation to Assan's management, and the result is that Assan sends a management team to America and the factory is re-opened, although the workers will earn a substantially lower wage than they had before the factory had originally closed. Still, Hunt is a hero for having convinced management to re-open.The culture clash is severe, as Japanese management demands far more regimentation and output than the workers are used to, and unpaid overtime is expected when output falls short of productivity standards. Management has little regard for the workers and the quality of their lives, focusing on productivity alone. The workers become agitated and their relationship with management becomes adversarial. Hunt, acting as employee liaison, tries to smooth things over, but is unable, and when a worker intentionally knocks over one of the Japanese managers during a company baseball game, the situation appears beyond repair.Japanese management sees little point in keeping the factory open until Hunt contends that he can match the production of a Japanese factory in its best month, meaning 15,000 completed cars. Amused by this contention, Japanese management agrees that if this output is reached, the factory would remain open and wages would return to the levels in effect prior to the original closing of the factory. Otherwise, it would close.Hunt advises the workers of this deal, but his announcement is met with incredulity, and, to appease them, he falsely relates that a lesser raise would still be earned if output exceeded 13,000 cars. The workers give it a shot, but, despite working long hours and on weekends, they conclude that the goal of 15,000 is unattainable, and decide to go for the raise that would come if 13,000 cars were completed. After attaining this goal, the workers walk out on management when a dispute arises. Now, Hunt must come clean, and tell his town that the made a deal for 15,000 cars, and that failure would result in no raises, which would devastate the town's local economy. Hunt has now gone from hero to goat, and his co-workers are furious.Still, in the end they put their noses to the grindstone and put their differences with the Japanese managers aside as the senior executive from Japan is coming to check on the state of the factory. When the executive comes by, they have fallen slightly short of their 15,000 target, but the Japanese executive is impressed by the team spirit he sees in the factory. Liking the way that the Americans and Japanese are now working together, he decides to keep the factory open, and give the full raises, and the stage is set for an era of understanding among all those working at the factory."

While that strain still exists between him and Max exacerbated by what he learns of his parents' relationship, things take a further turn when it is discovered that Max, who has a ostrich mentality in not wanting to know anything bad, has a potentially life threatening health issue, a manifestation of his diabetes, which ends up trumping all else in David's life.—Huggo Happy-go-lucky advertising executive David Basner (Tom Hanks), who recently got a promotion at his Chicago ad agency, returns to work from a vacation.

Children of a Lesser God,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090830/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A new speech teacher at a school for the deaf falls in love with the janitor, a deaf woman speechless by choice. Having taught at the best institutions in the country aside from other more eclectic jobs, James Leeds, with progressive methods, has just started teaching at a school for the deaf on an island off the New England coast, where he is assigned primarily to a speech class for the upper grades. At the school, he quickly notices the young cleaning woman, who he learns is twenty-five year old Sarah Norman and who, deaf herself, was once a student there and has been there since the age of five. He can see that she is bright, headstrong and angry, on top of which she doesn't speak, the latter issues a result of a troubled home life, her mother, her only touchstone to family, who she has purposefully not seen in eight years. As he is able to get through to most of his students to feel more and more comfortable in speaking for a more holistic life, Jim, with the reluctant blessing of the school's superintendent Dr. Curtis Franklin, who has always and still considers Sarah a proverbial pain in the you-know-where, tries to get Sarah to learn how to speak so that she can reach her full potential beyond being a cleaning woman, which he will further learn is a choice if only as it allows her to live her life somewhat in solitude in her silence and anger. Although unable to break through to her on the speaking side of the equation, he is able to break through on a more humanistic level as they end up falling for each other eventually embark on a relationship. The question then becomes if there is the possibility of a long term future for them, especially in being able to bridge their many divides - not only the divide between the world of the hearing and the deaf - and in Sarah never having had a sense of who she truly is as a complete human being and not just the deaf girl who may now see what Jim is doing as solely his latest ""project"".—Huggo James is a new speech teacher at a school for the deaf. He falls for Sarah, a pupil who decided to stay on at the school rather than venture into the big bad world. She shuns him at first, refusing to read his lips and only using signs. Will her feelings change over time?—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> Somewhere in pastoral New England, an idealistic young teacher, James Leeds (William Hurt), is appointed to the faculty at a state school for the deaf. Given his three years in the Peace Corps and deep interest in his students' lives, in comes as not much of a surprise when he starts getting involved in the life of Sarah Norman (Marlee Matlin). He first sees Sarah working as a janitor and yelling (via sign language) at a cook, and subsequently learns that Sarah is a bit of an outcast at the school. The teachers don't know what to do with her, but James tries to build a relationship with her anyway.James slowly manages to crack Sarah's icy façade, and she finally accepts a dinner invitation. It becomes quickly clear that Sarah is highly resistant to speaking aloud, despite James' encouragement to do so. Although she claims that it's because she already uses sign language, James suspects a deeper reason.James gets a chance to talk to Sarah's mother, Mrs. Norman (Piper Laurie) and learns that Sarah and her sister Ruth were once popular with their male classmates, but simply because these boys wanted only sex. Because of this impersonal treatment, Sarah now mistrusts any hearing man, and would rather not deal with anyone in general. James claims he isn't like the others, but Sarah doesn't trust him. Everything changes when James finds Sarah swimming naked in the school pool; he joins her in the pool and quickly begin a romantic relationship.Soon they are living together, which causes the school dean to warn James that this relationship will ultimately fail. James disregards this advice and continues on with Sarah. Hurdles begin to arise for them, however. For example, James arranges for his students to perform a choreographed dance, which for some unknown reason makes Sarah angry. Sarah later reveals that this is due, in part, to her thinking that James despises her for not speaking.Despite some emotional bonds, James' focus on getting Sarah to speak begins to annoy Sarah, and - again - she feels like he's looking down on her for not speaking. In short, between Sarah's angst and childhood traumas, and James's fundamental inability as a hearing person to appreciate the life of a deaf person, the couple reaches a breaking point in which Sarah finally speaks (her only spoken line in the film), basically saying, ""Here! I'm finally speaking! Is that what you wanted?"" (See the movie quotes for the actual quote).Sarah goes to live with her mother and in the process rebuilds that long-estranged relationship, and finds a job as a manicurist in the meantime. James continues to pursue her but she rebuffs all his attempts. Finally, Sarah and James reunite in a pivotal scene in the school gym. We are left with the impression that they're going to try this relationship again, this time with new knowledge about the other that will help make it successful."
Hoosiers,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091217/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A coach with a checkered past and a local drunk train a small-town high school basketball team to become a top contender for the state championship in 1950s Indiana. Based on the true story of a small-town Indiana team that made the state finals in 1954, this movie chronicles the attempts of a coach with a spotty past, and the town's basketball-loving drunk to lead their high school team to victory.—Thomas Pluck <stripey@winternet.com> A high school basketball coach and the town drunk try to shape the local boys squad into an unlikely contender for the Indiana state championship in this sports fantasy.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> A classic tale of redemption, this film features a volatile coach and a former star player-turned alcoholic leading a small-town basketball team on an improbable run to the Indiana high school championship game. Coach Norman Dale encounters several hurdles in his path: a feisty teacher determined to keep the best player from going out for the team, a town chock full of second-guessing fathers, and a group of undisciplined athletes. Story inspired by the Milan (Indiana) Indians' state title of 1954.—David S. Johnson {davidsjohnson@bigfoot.com} On an October morning in 1951, Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) drives through the Indiana countryside. In the afternoon he arrives in the small rural town of Hickory and enters the high school. He notices, on a shelf in the hall, basketball trophies won in previous years. As the bell rings to end the school day, he encounters teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). She realizes that Norman must be the new basketball coach and teacher of history and civics. She directs him to the office of principal Cletus Summers (Sheb Wooley), where the two men recall how they met many years ago at Buffalo State Teachers College. They had lost touch until recently, when Cletus tracked down Norman and asked him to come coach at Hickory. When Norman thanks Cletus for the opportunity, Cletus interrupts and says, ""Your slate's clean here."" They proceed to the gym, where student Jimmy Chitwood (Maris Valainis) is shooting baskets. Cletus introduces Norman, but Jimmy ignores the new coach and keeps shooting.That evening on his farm, Cletus explains to Norman that Jimmy has been strongly affected by the recent death of the previous coach, who was like a father to Jimmy. Now the young man has withdrawn from almost everything and everyone and has decided not to play basketball this season. Cletus adds that Jimmy is the best player he has ever seen. As they finish talking, Norman cryptically mentions that he hopes things will work out for him this time.That night, Norman meets some of the townsmen in the barbershop, who bombard him with questions. He tells them he last coached 12 years ago, in Ithaca, New York, and that he has been in the Navy for the past 10 years. The men voice their opinions on what Norman should do with the team. They all agree that Jimmy must rejoin the Huskers for them to have a winning season. Losing patience with all the questions and unwelcome advice, Norman cuts short the meet-and-greet and leaves.The next morning, before school begins, Myra tells Norman that Jimmy is her neighbor, and she has been looking out for him ever since his father died. She thinks it best that he stay off the team. After school, the Huskers are already practicing in the gym when Norman walks in. George Walker (Chelcie Ross), one of the townspeople Norman met in the barbershop, is leading the practice and assumes that Norman will continue allowing him to assist. When Norman brusquely makes it clear that he doesn't need any help, George storms off. As Norman gathers the seven Huskers and begins to introduce himself, Buddy (Brad Long) rudely whispers to his teammate Whit (Brad Boyle), who is standing next to him. Norman orders Buddy to leave, and Buddy convinces Whit to go with him. Jimmy is watching, unseen, at one of the far exits. Norman begins the practice and puts the Huskers through drills of passing, running in place, and dribbling while weaving between chairs; they never scrimmage. Norman explains, ""There's more to the game than shooting. There's fundamentals and defense."" He also wants them to be in top physical condition because, if they continue to have only five players, substitutions and rest during games will be impossible. On the second day of practice, several townspeople walk in to observe; they've heard about Norman's unusual drills. Rollin Butcher (Robert Swan), Whit's father, brings in his son and has him apologize for walking out the day before. Rollin then tells the other men to leave, because the coach doesn't want them there.One day, as Cletus and Norman eat pie at the diner downtown, in comes Wilbur ""Shooter"" Flatch (Dennis Hopper), stumbling a bit and wearing a worn-out coat. Shooter, a former basketball player, describes for Norman how he almost led his team to victory in the 1933 sectional game of the tournament on a last-second shot. When Shooter asks Cletus in a low voice if he can borrow some spare change, Shooter's son, Everett (David Neidorf), who has been sitting in another part of the diner, walks up. He insists that Shooter give back the money and then escorts his father outside.One afternoon, as Jimmy shoots baskets at the school's outdoor court, Norman approaches him and asks why he wasn't in class that day, but Jimmy doesn't answer. Norman goes on to tell him that he believes Jimmy has a special talent that belongs only to him. Norman concludes by stating matter-of-factly that he doesn't care if Jimmy rejoins the team, and he walks away. From a window in the school, Myra has been watching them. Entering the school, Norman runs into Myra, who tells him to leave Jimmy alone. They begin arguing about Jimmy's future. She says she thinks Jimmy could receive an academic college scholarship if he concentrates on his studies instead of athletics. She doesn't want him to get stuck in Hickory, where the high point of his life will have been his days playing high school basketball. She doesn't understand why the townspeople place so much emphasis on the sport. She also is suspicious of Norman, wondering why someone like him has moved to Hickory, a town unaccustomed to seeing outsiders. She believes he might be running away from something.At the beginning of an afternoon pep session meant to showcase this season's Huskers, several people in the crowd begin chanting ""We want Jimmy!"" Norman silences them and defends his six-man squad, concluding, ""This is your team.""In the locker room before the first home game, Norman reminds the team what he taught them in practice: they must pass at least four times before attempting a shot. After Rev. Doty (Wil Dewitt) offers a prayer, a kneeling Strap (Scott Summers) continues praying silently, even after everyone else has departed the locker room and begun warming up. Norman tells team manager Ollie (Wade Schenck) that he will substitute for Strap in the game until Strap finishes praying. To Ollie's relief, Strap shows up right before tip-off. Early in the game, the Huskers quickly fall behind, and some of the townspeople in the crowd start yelling at the Huskers to shoot. Jimmy watches from the top row. Myra and Shooter are in the crowd as well. At halftime, Norman chews out the players, again telling them to always make at least four passes before shooting. In the second half, an impatient Rade (Steve Hollar), feeling pressure from the fans, decides to disobey the rule and shoot if he's open. Even though he makes these shots, Norman benches him. Moments later, after Merle (Kent Poole) fouls out, Rade attempts to reenter the game. Norman orders him to sit back down, even though this means Hickory will have only four players on the floor for the rest of the game. The fans yell and boo, but Shooter smiles with amazement. In the locker room after the loss, Norman asks the boys to consider whether they really want to be on the team. He reminds them that his instructions to them are ""the law, absolutely and without discussion!""The next week, Norman encounters Myra and her sports-loving mother, Opal (Fern Persons), outside the feed-and-grain store. Opal invites him to Sunday dinner because she wants to talk basketball. Arriving well before dinnertime, Norman helps the two women grind sorghum on their farm. When he gets a chance to talk to Myra alone, she tells him a bit about her family and past, including the fact that she left Hickory for a few years but later returned. When he asks her if she's ever thought about getting married, she declines to answer, explaining that in Hickory, people tend to mind their own business.A few days later, Shooter unexpectedly calls on Norman at home and offers him unsolicited advice about the Huskers' upcoming game against Cedar Knob. Norman can tell from Shooter's remarks that he is quite knowledgeable about basketball history and strategy and has valuable insights into Hickory's opponents. That weekend, the Huskers travel in the team bus, owned and driven by Preacher Purl (Michael Sassone), Strap's father, to their first away game at Cedar Knob. The game is a tough one, with lots of physical contact. A drunk Shooter is present. Norman begins arguing with one of the referees, and then the Cedar Knob coach, and then one of the Cedar Knob players, who pokes Norman in the chest. Norman slaps his hand away, and Rade decks the player with a left hook. The rest of the boys begin scuffling. Norman and Rade are ejected, leaving a distressed-looking Cletus to take over as coach.The next day, Norman visits Cletus, who is suffering from heart trouble and has been ordered to be on bed rest for a while. After that, Norman goes to see Shooter at his dilapidated cabin in the woods. He offers to make Shooter his assistant coach, on one condition: he must remain sober. Offended and embarrassed, Shooter asks Norman to leave. However, at the next home game, Shooter surprises the players and perplexes the townspeople by showing up in a suit and tie, ready to accept the coach's offer.The next week, after class, Everett tells Norman he has doubts about his father's being the assistant coach, because he's a drunk who will do something stupid. After that, Myra comes in and informs Norman that a town meeting has been scheduled for Saturday, at which Hickory residents will decide if he will be removed as coach.During that Friday's game, Norman receives a technical foul and, after arguing with the referee, is thrown out. An anxious Shooter is forced to take over. The next day, Myra finds Norman standing alone along the fencerow on Cletus's farm, lost in thought. She tells him about an old newspaper article she found at the library, which describes how Norman was suspended from college coaching after he hit one of his players. Myra then says she appreciates how Norman is trying to help Shooter and how he hasn't pressured Jimmy to rejoin the team.At the town meeting that night, which takes place in the church, Norman gives a brief speech in which he defends himself. Myra then steps up to the lectern and prepares to tell the crowd what she has discovered about the coach. But she abruptly changes her mind and tearfully tells them she thinks it would be a mistake to let him go. After the residents vote on Norman's dismissal, as George finishes counting the ballots, Jimmy enters the church. He announces he has decided to rejoin the team, but only if Norman is allowed to stay. George indicates that the majority of votes are for dismissal, but Opal calls for a revote. This time most of the residents vote for Norman to stay.With Jimmy on the team, the reenergized Huskers go on a winning streak. About halfway through the season, Norman counsels Shooter, who is struggling with sobriety, that if he can't resist the urge to drink, he should go to the hospital to dry out. Shooter promises not to fall off the wagon if Norman will promise not to be ejected from any more games. At the next home game, Norman gets himself thrown out on purpose so that Shooter can take over as coach and hopefully gain some confidence. Shooter has the team run the picket fence play, and they win. Everett is proud of his father.At the end of the regular season, tournament play begins. At the start of Hickory's sectional game against Terhune, Shooter is nowhere to be found. During the game, he suddenly shows up and stumbles onto the court, drunk and yelling. After Rollin leads him away, a technical foul is called on Hickory. Everett becomes angry and distracted. When one of the Terhune players shoves Jimmy during a layup, Everett retaliates by punching him. As the two continue fighting, the other players from both teams join in. Everett is pushed hard into a trophy case in the adjoining hallway, cutting his shoulder badly. The fight breaks up and the game continues, with Hickory winning by 2 points.The next day, Norman and Everett go looking for Shooter, who has been missing since he was tossed out of the sectional. They find him lying unconscious in the snow-covered woods. Shooter is soon admitted to the hospital's alcohol rehabilitation unit, where Norman visits him.That weekend, reporters mob Norman and the team as they enter the Jasper gym for the regional game against Linton. In the locker room, Norman advises the Huskers to think about this game only and not to worry about progressing in the tournament. They should focus on the fundamentals, not on winning or losing.With the score tied at 50 with 2:30 to go, one of the Linton players hits Everett in his injured shoulder, causing the stitches to pull out. At first Norman wants Everett to ignore the pain and keep playing, but then he changes his mind and takes him out. Strap, not one of the better players, enters the game and immediately scores several points. When Buddy fouls out, only Ollie is left to substitute; he reluctantly enters the game. With Hickory up by 1, Ollie is fouled. He shoots awkwardly and misses his free throw. Linton then scores. Ollie is fouled as he shoots and misses. Two Linton players try to intimidate Ollie before he attempts his free throws, but Merle steps forward to offer encouragement. Using the same unusual underhand shooting style as before, Ollie makes both his free tosses, winning the game and sending the Huskers to the state finals.The following week, after Norman receives a haircut from Opal at her home, he notices Myra working in the muddy garden. They go on a walk. He asks her if she would like to go to a movie sometime, but she responds by bringing up the incident in which he hit his college player. He says he can't really explain or understand why he did it. They kiss.A few days later, Norman and the Huskers encounter a group of reporters gathered in the Hickory gym, waiting to interview Norman about the upcoming state-finals game. That same week, Everett visits Shooter in the hospital.On the morning of the state finals, Norman and the team enter an empty Butler Fieldhouse and are awed by its enormity. Norman has the Huskers measure the length of the free-throw lane and the distance from the rim to the floor. He reminds them that these dimensions are the same as those in the Hickory gym.In the locker room that night, Norman reviews game strategy with the team. He then tells them that the last few months have been special for him. He asks the Huskers if they would like to say anything. Merle wants to win for all the small schools that never had a chance to get to the state finals. Everett wants to win for his dad. Buddy wants to win for their coach. After Rev. Doty and Preacher Purl offer appropriate Bible verses, the Huskers take the floor. They struggle early in the game against the taller and more muscular South Bend Central Bears. But they regroup and begin to close the scoring gap until they are tied with the Bears at 40. After Rade intercepts a South Bend pass, Hickory controls the ball. With 19 seconds on the clock, Hickory calls time-out. Norman tells his players that, because the Bears will expect Jimmy to take the last shot, the Huskers will use Jimmy as a decoy while Merle attempts the final basket. Seeing the boys' uncomfortable reaction to his plan, Norman demands to know what's wrong. They say nothing until Jimmy declares, ""I'll make it."" Norman hesitates but then realizes that entrusting Jimmy with Hickory's last chance to score is indeed the best course of action. Play resumes, and with only 2 seconds left, Jimmy launches his shot, which sails through the net. The Hickory fans erupt in celebration and spill onto the floor.The final scene shows a grade-school-age boy shooting baskets in a quiet, empty Hickory gym as the camera zooms in on a team photo of the state-champion Huskers hanging on the wall."
Soul Man,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091991/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"To achieve his dream of attending Harvard, a pampered teen poses as a young black man to receive a full scholarship. Sadly, all good things must come to an end, and now, the party is over for the carefree, pampered, and very white California kid, Mark Watson. As a result, with his self-made millionaire father refusing to pay the tuition to attend the prestigious Harvard Law School, Mark's only hope rests on a full scholarship intended for an African-American applicant, and a bunch of tanning pills. Now, with his curly perm and the dark complexion, Mark can fraudulently make his dream come true; however, has Mark ever considered the ramifications, moral and legal, of his deception?—Nick Riganas Mark doesn't expect any problems in going to college: he and his friend have reserved places in Harvard and his parents have the money to pay for his education there. But suddenly his father's neurotic psychiatrist advises him to go on vacation in Hawaii instead of spending more money on his son. Since Mark wants to keep his lifestyle, including a fancy car and a flat shared with his friend, he seeks financial support. The only foundation which still accepts applications is for blacks only -- no problem, with lots of bronzing pills and ""soul in his voice"" he sets out to Harvard. Soon he has to realize that being black will cause some people to handle him differently.—Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> Mark Watson (C. Thomas Howell), a recent college graduate living in Beverly Hills, California, plans to go to law school at Harvard. Mark feels secure that his tuition and other fees for law school will be paid for by his wealthy parents, who had saved money for him. However, during a conversation with his eccentric father (James B. Sikking), he finds out that his parents have reneged and spent the money on a timeshare condominium in the Tropics. In retaliation, Mark hangs his father in effigy, using a Cabbage Patch doll he's dressed up to look like his dad.Mark starts a frantic search for a scholarship program, however, his parent's wealth keeps him from qualifying. He finds one scholarship given to an academically exceptional student from the state of California each year. The only catch is that the student must be African-American to qualify. Mark talks to a friend of his who works as a pharmaceutical technician and obtains experimental tanning pills. Mark exceeds the suggested dosage and darkens his skin to appear black. The ruse works; Mark is able to fool his best friend, Gordon Bloomfield (Arye Gross) (who's also attending Harvard), and the scholarship committee. Mark privately reveals his charade to Gordon while jogging. The astonished Gordon falls off a pier into the ocean.Mark and Gordon arrive in Boston and rent an apartment from an obviously bigoted man named Mr. Dunbar (Leslie Nielson) whose spoiled and outgoing daughter, Whitney (Melora Hardin), will also be living in the same dorm house. She quickly comes on to Mark, saying that she feels the pain of his slave ancestry. She also invites him to her parent's house for dinner which results in an uncomfortable evening for Mark; Whitney's father glares at him thinking he's only looking for a white girlfriend. The rest of the family has their prejudicial opinions of him as well.Mark and Gordon register for classes together, Mark breaking a minor oath with Gordon not to take criminal law - Mark sees that the professor, Mr. Banks (James Earl Jones), is also black and believes he can take advantage of the connection and will coast through the semester. However, Mark finds that Banks' class is much tougher than he thought and that the no-nonsense Banks tells Mark that he does not play favorites, no matter what race they are.Mark also meets a woman named Sarah (Rae Dawn Chong), also a law student and is immediately attracted to her. Sarah comes from a much poorer background than Mark and is working her way through law school. She is also a single mother who has a five-year-old son named George (Jonathan 'Fudge' Leonard) and she sees right through his flirting. Mark gradually wins her over, proving to her that he has the potential to excel academically.One day, while driving through Cambridge, Mark is followed by a policeman, who has blatantly targeted him in a racist manner. Mark follows the traffic laws and controls very carefully until he's forced to swerve from someone opening a car door in front of him; he's immediately pulled over. When the racist white officer asks to see his license, Mark remembers that the photo is of him as a white man and he tells the officer he lost it. He's arrested on the spot and thrown in jail where a group of disgruntled and racist white football fans beat him because their team lost to another team of mostly black players.Mark's incarceration prevents him from writing an important term paper for Professor Banks' class. He races to see Banks who refuses to grant him an extension on the due date. Mark tries to reason with the stolid professor, who seems unmoved by Mark's true story about being held without formal charges and being beat up in jail. Banks grants him a few days to turn in his paper, which finds Mark spending his Thanksgiving vacation completing it. When he reads it, Banks is actually quite impressed.Late in the semester, Mark, while studying with Sarah, finds out from her that she was the other applicant from Southern California for the same scholarship he'd won. Mark is crushed, feeling guilty that he'd stolen her chance to attend Harvard with the grant. Gordon tells Mark to ignore his feelings; if he's exposed, he'll be ruined and be expelled from the college. Mark, en route to tell Sarah the truth, is stopped by Professor Banks who, seeing that Mark's classwork has shown exceptional improvement during the semester, offers him a seat on the university's student judiciary council when the council's only black student had fallen ill and stepped down. The conversation only makes Mark feel guiltier, but he accepts.Mark returns to his apartment and meets Gordon. He tries to tell his roommate about his guilt, but is dismissed. Gordon tells Mark to go into his room where he finds Whitney, mostly undressed and wanting to have sex with him. Mark refuses, knowing that Whitney's father hates him and tries to get her to leave. At that moment, Mark's parents make a surprise visit and Sarah shows up shortly after. Mark frantically tries to juggle talking to all of them but eventually reveals his identity. Sarah storms off, Mark's parents are shocked and Whitney is led off by her father after the superintendent of the building calls him and rats Mark out. Whitney's racist father also hits Mark in the stomach without provocation and the super happily serves him and Gordon eviction papers. After everyone leaves, Mark and Gordon work on a plan to resolve everything.The student judiciary convenes the next day. Gordon goes in ahead of Mark and offers an impassioned defense, saying that Mark feels great remorse for committing fraud and especially for cheating Sarah out of her rightful scholarship. Mark reveals himself to the council and to the astonishment of everyone in the room. Everyone mutters, ""no wonder"" at seeing Mark's true race. Professor Banks is not amused at all.A little later, Mark meets privately with Banks in his office and tells him that he plans to apologize publicly and in writing to the university, allow his future wages to be garnished to pay back Sarah and also allow a future scholarship to be established in Sarah's name. He also asks that he be allowed to continue to attend law school and that Mark's parents will pay for one year of his education until he finds a job. Professor Banks tells Mark that he's learned something that other white students never could; what it feels like to be black and the subject of prejudice as a minority. Mark claims that he didn't learn such a thing because he could have bowed out at any time. Banks believes Mark has learned a great deal more than he thought.Mark takes up a busboy's job much like the one that Sarah had, working in the university's cafeteria. He overhears a couple of bigoted students telling a racial joke within earshot of Sarah and punches them both, sending them flying. The movie ends with the two of them striking up a friendship again."

After being given a riddle for his password, Terry determines the password to be B-flat, after the key in which ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" is supposedly written (as the actual song by The Rolling Stones is recorded in the key of B-flat). Jack sends her to the British Consulate to deliver the message ""Dog's barking, can't fly without umbrella"" to Department C. Despite feeling ludicrous, Terry delivers the message to the head consul Jeremy Talbot (John Wood) who is apparently puzzled and sends Terry away, telling her there is no Department C.

Did she kill him and, if not, is she in danger? Alex Sternberg wakes up with a hangover and no memory of how she ended up in bed with a dead man. She flees, convinced that she has had another blackout and stabbed someone. Her only support, Turner, an ex cop and recovering alcoholic who is unsympathetic to her plight.

Shocked and oblivious to her whereabouts, Viveca notices that the bedroom television is broadcasting an interview with her deceased bedfellow; he is Bobby Korshack, a controversial fitness photographer who was prosecuted on obscenity charges. Finding a knife in Korshack's chest, Viveca stumbles through the studio for a glass of wine, washes blood from her hands, then telephones her hairdresser and confidante, Joaquin ""Jacky"" Manero. When she tells him about the dead man, Jacky advises her to call the police. However, she cannot be sure of her innocence, so she leaves the studio and hails a cab.Surprised to learn it is Thanksgiving, Viveca cashes a check at a local bar, packs luggage, and heads to the airport. When she learns that all flights are booked, she rushes outside and provokes a minor curbside automobile accident. Fleeing the scene, Viveca jumps into a nearby jalopy owned by Turner Kendall, who drives Viveca away from the airport, spouting racial epithets and explaining that he was dropping off his young daughter; the girl is taking a return flight to her mother's home.

Greenbaum is following him. When Viveca discovers Turner in a wig closet, he declares that Korshack's killer framed the actress by having another woman, disguised as Viveca, run through the hall to confuse the photographer's neighbors.

Greenbaum and his policemen arrive, and Isabel pins the murder on Jacky. However, Jacky explains that Isabel murdered the photographer because he was blackmailing her with illicit photographs. Sgt. Greenbaum is sympathetic to Isabel's plea when he learns that her father is a judge, and Jacky realizes he has been had.Sometime later, Viveca, now calling herself Alex, visits Turner at the hospital and reports that Jacky and Isabel are both suspects in the murder.

When Doug's father, an Air Force Pilot, is shot down by MiGs belonging to a radical Middle Eastern state, no one seems able to get him out. Doug finds Chappy, an Air Force Colonel who is intrigued by the idea of sending in two fighters piloted by himself and Doug to rescue Doug's father after bombing the MiG base. Their only problems: Borrowing two fighters, getting them from California to the Mediteranean without anyone noticing, and Doug's inability to hit anything unless he has music playing. Then come the minor problems of the state's air defenses.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Doug, a graduating high school senior, must quickly come to grips with manhood in a time of great emotional stress. He demonstrates leadership of his peers as together they develop materials and information to effect a rescue mission. He interacts with a skilled Air Force veteran to accomplish this daring mission. An underlying theme of the movie is the friendly conflict between children and parents, including several scenes where adults are lampooned as ineffective or easily redirected. Doug must also realize that he doesn't have all the answers, and must rely on the wisdom of a mentor. The pivotal rescue mission and climax showcase the talent of youth and the reconnection with that youth in the heart of the partnering Air Force pilot.=======================================================Doug Masters is a hot-headed high school senior about to graduate. He is the son of a top-rated US Air Force pilot, Colonel Ted Masters, and lives on his father's base. Doug has a network of friends, also military kids, who will often secretly procure information for him and each other by exploiting their parents' positions on the base. Doug himself is often given the opportunity to fly with his father and control the F16 jet they go up in. Doug is often also given time in the base's simulator. Doug also has aspirations to join the Air Force and attend flight school to become a military pilot. He receives a letter that states he's been turned down for admission to an air academy.Doug accepts a challenge from another teenager to race along a dangerous canyon: Doug will fly his small Cessna airplane against Knotcher, who will ride a motorcycle. Before the race begins, Knotcher tinkers with Doug's plane's fuel line so that it will stall out in the last stages of the race. Doug is barely able to win the race but starts a fight with Knotcher. Doug later is grounded by his father for acting in such a reckless and stupid manner.Doug's father takes a mission to fly reconnaissance over a Middle Eastern country. Though the government there is presumed to be non-hostile, Col. Masters and his wingman are shot down. Masters himself is captured and held prisoner by that country's Minister of Defense, Colonel Nakesh. Nakesh tortures Doug's father and proclaims him a rogue terrorist. He sentences him to death.Back at Master's base, the commander informs Doug about his father's capture and that the US State Department plans not to invade the rogue country to rescue his father. Doug is immediately angry, saying that the US government isn't doing enough to help his father, however the base commander tells Doug that their hands are tied but they are continuing to search for a diplomatic solution. Doug talks to an older pilot, a friend of his father's, Col. Charles 'Chappy' Sinclair, who tells Doug to let the government continue their efforts to secure Col. Masters' release. Doug asks Chappy if there's a possibility that a pair of F16s could fly into the hostile country and rescue his father. Chappy says it would be a long shot but also gravely warns Doug not to try it.Doug talks to his friends at their clubhouse -- an old, abandoned bunker on the base -- and asks them to help him gather intelligence information on the country and city where his father is being held as well as their military capabilities. Doug and his friends have built an extensive network for themselves around the base and often fool their parents who work around top secret information.Doug talks to Chappy again telling him that he can get more information for him to plot a mission to rescue his father. Chappy admires Doug's initiative and, knowing that Doug's father is running out of time quickly, agrees to help him.Doug's friends begin to gather the info they need: at one point they set off firecrackers in a main command room, distracting the personnel long enough to gain access to a restricted computer. Chappy guides Doug's crew through the planning process and they formulate a mission to have two, fully-fueled and armed F16s for Doug and Chappy.Chappy decides to take Doug up for a test flight to see how well he can do in combat. While they're up, Doug uses a Walkman to play music (Queen's ""One Vision"" and the Spencer Davis Group's ""Gimme Some Lovin'"") he claims gives him the proper rhythm to hit his targets. Chappy harshly tells him to cut the music but Doug insists and proves that his method works and impresses Chappy. The night before they're supposed to leave, Chappy congratulates Doug's crew on a job well done & insists that Doug get some sleep. Doug is defiant but agrees when Chappy tells him that many pilots have died in combat under his command, but they still followed orders.Chappy and Doug fly out on the mission, refueling along the flight path. When they reach the coast of the nation where his father was shot down, the two engage in air-to-ground combat with the country's outer defenses. Chappy's plane is hit and crashes. Before he goes down, Chappy tells Doug to continue & play a tape he'd prepared for him. Doug listens to it: Chappy gives him encouragement and tells him to stay focused & he'll be fine. At Nakesh's base, Nakesh himself begins to beat Doug's father in retaliation.Doug reaches Nakesh's base and begins an air-to-ground attack that takes out missile and artillery installations. Doug contacts them by radio, bluffing that he's part of a larger force that has come to free his father. When Nakesh won't meet his demands, Doug drops bombs on a nearby oil refinery. Nakesh consents and releases Col. Masters, allowing him to drive to the end of a runway alone in a jeep. Doug is about to land to pick up his father, when a sniper shoots the Colonel in the shoulder. Doug destroys another oil refinery in retaliation, then firebombs the runway to cover his own landing. He meets his father, helps him into the plane and takes off. Low on ammunition, fuel and missiles, Doug engages Nakesh himself in the air. After a brief dogfight, Doug destroys his plane. A small squadron of Nakesh's pilots are waiting for him but bug out when a squadron of American F16s arrives and escorts Doug out of hostile territory. Doug asks the squadron to take up a missing man formation for Chappy, which they gladly do.Back in the United States, Doug's father is debriefed and Doug goes to a military hearing to answer for stealing his plane and taking on an unauthorized mission. The tribunal calls in a special witness, who turns out to be Chappy himself, having survived the crash. When Doug is admonished by the base commander, Doug asserts that no one else seemed to be willing to rescue his father. Chappy testifies, saying that he aided Doug and that Doug also needs to learn discipline and that an air academy would be the best place for him to learn. The commander agrees to endorse Doug's application."

Their reunion is joyful but also stirs up much tension.—Leon Wolters <wolters@strw.LeidenUniv.nl> As children, the now-adult Magrath sisters moved to Hazelhurst, Mississippi to live with their grandparents after their father abandoned the family and their mother subsequently hanged herself in the basement, which made national headlines Lenny, the eldest, still lives in the house taking care of ailing Granddaddy; next door their first cousin, stuck-up Chick Boyle, thinks the scandal of the suicide affected her the most, socially. A frumpy spinster with little experience with men, Lenny is the forgotten one. Meg, the middle sister, is the narcissistic wild child who left for Hollywood to pursue a singing career, which is not going as well as she would like those at home to think. Growing up, she generally got what she wanted as the extroverted one and arguably because she was the one who found Momma in the basement. ""Who"" she wanted was Doc Porter, who now walks with a limp due to an incident with Meg, but would probably run back to her if she returned--despite being married. Becky ""Babe"" Magrath, the youngest, married Zackery Botrelle at 18; now he's a lawyer and state senator but she is the overgrown-little-princess kind of wife. Despite Meg being the one who found Momma, Babe is the one who thinks about the why behind Momma's suicide the most. Meg is called back to Hazelhurst with the news that Babe has shot Zackery. He survived--he's in the hospital recovering from the stomach wound--and Babe doesn't deny shooting him; she claims she was actually aiming for his heart. But she refuses to tell anyone, including her young lawyer Barnett Lloyd, why she did it. The dynamic among the very different but loving sisters plays into how they deal with Babe's situation and their own issues.—Huggo"
Tough Guys,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092105/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two elderly gangsters are released from prison only to find they have trouble fitting in as old men who still take no guff from anyone. Harry and Archie are released from prison ready to collect their Social Security. How could they get into trouble at their age? Let's count the ways; A parole officer who is a famous criminal groupie, Dead end where people don't know they are dealing with dangerous, though older, criminals, a hit man who can barely see, but who still has an outstanding contract on them. Does anyone still rob trains?—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In 1986, after serving 30 years in prison for a failed train robbery, partners Archie Long (Kirk Douglas) and Harry Doyle (Burt Lancaster) are released from prison, and giddily plan to visit members of their old gang. When Archie comes upon a newspaper vending machine, he defies Harry, who insists they are respectable citizens now, by forcing it open and stealing a newspaper. As they read the front page, they notice that the ""Gold Coast Flyer,"" the train they tried to rob 30 years earlier, is being retired. Its last run will occur in one week, but the ex-convicts are annoyed that they are not named in the article in connection with their robbery attempt.Soon, their probation officer, Richie Evans (Dana Carvey), interrupts, and flatters them by observing that they represent a dying breed. As Richie leaves to get his car, an elderly stranger, Leon B. Little (Eli Wallach), appears and shoots at the partners with a double-barreled shotgun, but misses. As Leon scrambles looking for his glasses, the partners escape. When they find Richie, Archie insists on driving, although he finds the latest car technology annoying.At the police station, Sergeant Deke Yablonski (Charles Durning) is not happy about learning to do payroll on a computer, he would rather track recently released convicts like Archie and Harry whom he sent to prison for the train robbery 30 years earlier.At a bank, Archie and Harry notice the wall-mounted surveillance cameras. Harry has no current photo identification, and shows a bank officer a personal photograph instead. Suddenly, two thugs attempt a bank robbery. Harry wrestles the gun from one robber and takes it, but Archie persuades him not to shoot the man to avoid ruining his double-breasted suit. Afterward, Richie compliments the men on their grace under pressure, and the bank officer cashes Harry's check without I. D.At his office, Richie explains the rules of parole. He gives 67-year-old Archie a job assignment and a voucher for a welfare hotel. Being age 72 and within retirement age with a mild heart condition, Harry is given lodging at the Golden Sunset Retirement home, and will receive a monthly social security income of $435. Harry does not like the idea of retirement at all, but Richie says retirement is mandatory for seventy-year-old's. The rules also state that ex-convicts cannot fraternize for three years. Later, Richie's hostile and strict boss reminds him that he is not to play favorites with Archie and Harry. If they violate parole only once, they are to be sent back to prison.Archie walks into Mickey's bar, an old hangout, and leaves when he realizes it is now a bar for homosexuals. Harry meets Archie outside just as Leon B. Little appears with his shotgun, and orders the friends to walk into an alley. Harry and Archie maneuver the poor-sighted Leon into an open manhole, but they are still unable to figure out who Leon is, or the reason for his vendetta.On the way to the retirement home, a street gang tries to collect money from the ex-convicts, but Archie and Harry diffuse the situation with some ethics code banner followed by a few well-placed punches, causing the street gang to flee. Once they reach their destination, Archie is convinced that Harry will be running the place within a week. As the friends say goodbye, Archie senses that Harry is sinking into a depression.At the police station, Sgt. Deke Yablonski tries to convince the captain that Archie and Harry will revert to their life of crime and wants them arrested and put away. The captain orders Yablonski to get back to record keeping, and forget about sending the crooks back to prison.At the retirement home, Harry does not like the food, and starts a mutiny... as if reminiscing about protesting the cafeteria food in prison.Working at a yogurt shop, Archie hates waiting on difficult customers, and dumps yogurt on a boy's head.Harry meets up with Belle (Alexis Smith), a former showgirl, and resident aerobics instructor. She invites him to visit and reminisce.After Archie is fired, he heads to Tunney's Gym to work out. However, the former boxing gym is now an aerobics studio, and he has difficulty acclimating to the unfamiliar equipment. Archie is interested in the manager, a pretty blonde named Skye Foster (Darlanne Fluegel). She invites him to go dancing later in the evening. Archie goes to a mod clothing store where the owner and clerk Derek (Steven Memel), who only appears on a TV video monitor, gives him some advice on what modern and ""hot"" clothes to wear. Archie buys a new blue-colored outfit to impress Skye.That evening, Harry takes Belle on a date to a favorite nightclub still in existence. As they dance to standards, Archie is elsewhere at a underground nightclub, shaking and grinding with Skye to the music of the rock band, Red Hot Chili Peppers.Later, Richie Evans gets Archie a new job as a bus boy at a restaurant. Deke Yablonski visits Archie at the restaurant, and taunts him about his financial circumstances. Archie soon becomes frustrated with demanding customers and his abusive supervisor quits. Later, he tires of Skye's constant partying and breaks up with her. Both he and Harry hear a television news report about the end of the Gold Coast Flyer service.Meanwhile, Yablonski surprises Harry at a local bar and warns that Harry will slip up, and when that happens, he will be waiting to arrest him. Harry is too drunk to hit Yablonski, but Archie appears and punches the sergeant out instead. Harry falls asleep drunk and Archie puts him to bed. In the morning, they decide retirement does not agree with them. They decide to round up old gang members. They first venture to a restaurant where they meet their old mentor and boss Jimmy Ellis (Nathan Davis) who is frail, hard of hearing and travels with a long-term bodyguard named Vince (Monty Ash) who is nearly frail as Ellis. In the restaurant's bar, Harry and Archie meet their old friend ""Philly the Mouse,"" (Billy Barty) a dwarf who is currently a paraplegic.Meanwhile, Leon B. Little resurfaces and demands that Richie Evans tell him where he can find Archie and Harry, but Richie plays dumb. Leon discovers the information in Richie's file cabinet, and takes him hostage.After paying a visit to Dick Schultz (Simmy Bow), the ex-convicts find that he is suffering from dementia, and complain that their cronies have either become crippled or crazy. At the same time, the captain demands that Yablonski stop his surveillance on Harry and Archie or run the risk of getting fired and collecting early retirement.Elsewhere, Leon B. Little and Richie Evans show up at Belle's apartment looking for Harry. On the street, Archie and Harry lament that it is impossible to rob a bank without a gang, and decide to rob an armored car on the spur of the moment. As part of the heist, Harry pretends to have a heart attack. A guard falls for the ruse, and the ex-convicts steal his weapon and the armored car. In an industrial section of town, they realize the armored car contains no cash, only a roll of quarters. When a news report points out that they screwed up the heist, Archie wants to steal the Gold Coast Flyer and ride it to Mexico, going out in a ""blaze of glory."" Harry rejects the foolish plan.Meanwhile at the retirement home, Leon B. Little becomes impatient waiting for Harry and Archie. He leaves the apartment, taking Richie and Belle as hostages. Yablonski shows up at the retirement home and is told that Little is in an apartment with a gun. He investigates as Little sees Archie and Harry on the street and starts shooting at them. The ex-convicts duck to avoid being shot. Richie punches Little, who loses his glasses as he falls. Harry, Archie and Richie use Yablonski's car to escape.At the warehouse and hidden from police, Archie tries to persuade Richie to help him steal the Gold Coast Flyer. Richie refuses to become a criminal, and Archie drives off in Yablonski's car. That night, Harry has a nightmare where Archie attempt to rob the Gold Coast Flyer train on his own and Yablonski is waiting for him in disguise as a train engineer where he shoots Archie dead.The next day, Archie parks his stolen car on the train tracks, blocking the path of the Gold Coast Flyer. As the train stops, Archie takes his Uzi sub-machine gun that he took from the armored truck driver and warns the conductor a robbery is in progress. Harry pops up and sticks a gun (the same gun he took from one of the bank robbers) in the conductor's face. The train is full of reporters, and the ex-convicts stop to have their photographs taken and give interviews. Leon B. Little interrupts the proceedings, where he formally introduces himself to Archie and Harry and explains the reason for his trying to kill them. Leon B. Little claims that an associate and local mob boss, named Vinnie Mendelman, put out a $20,000 contract on Archie and Harry back in 1956 for not giving him any profits from their robbery jobs. Despite the fact that Vinnie Mindelman died a short while later and Harry and Archie have been imprisoned during that same time, Little waited 30 years for Harry and Archie to be released from prison to get the job done.Just then, armed police and SWAT men surround the train. Harry and Archie persuade Little to team up with them until the conflict is over. Yablonski addresses them through a bullhorn, and Harry agrees to hear what he has to say. Yablonski, who plans to join them on the train, warns that they may not come out alive. The journalists are freed, but Richie Evans boards the train in disguise as a police officer, and starts the engine. Although police open fire, the train pushes aside Yablonski's car, and starts down the track. The police fire a barrage of bullets at the departing train, while Archie returns fire with his sub-machine gun, damaging several police cars, but causing no casualties.Yablonski follows the train in a helicopter, and informs the robbers that the track ends before it reaches Mexico. The ex-convicts push Leon B. Little out of the caboose and he lands in a river, with him vowing to kill them for this... even if it takes another 30 years. Archie asks Richie to jump onto the roof of the last car, then detaches it, and reminds Richie that he is not a criminal. If police give him a hard time, he should insist he was coerced.As Harry and Archie put the train engine in full speed, border police officers open fire and then scramble as the train barrels past the end of the track, and comes to rest on Mexican soil. From the hovering helicopter Yablonski insanely laughs at their audacity, and tells the helicopter pilot to take him home. As Harry and Archie jump off the train, armed Mexican Federales surround them to place them under arrest for illegally entering Mexico. Archie and Harry once again put on their 'talk-their-way-out-of-a-tough-situation' routine speech, along with a well-placed kick to the groin..."
F/X,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089118/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A movie special effects man is hired to fake a real-life mob killing for a witness protection plan, but finds his own life in danger. Rollie is an expert in the art of special effects (F/X) and has a reputation built on many low-budget hack-and-slash films (including such titles as ""I Dismember Momma"") and is quite surprised to find that the FBI has a job for him. He is to stage the murder of a gangster who is about to enter the Witness Protection Program. He agrees, but then things get complicated. All the while, a New York City police detective, Leo McCarthy, is investigating the faked murder and can't understand why the FBI is even less helpful than usual.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The story opens at a fancy Manhattan restaurant where an elegantly dressed woman is enjoying a night out. As she and her companion enjoy a fine dinner, another man walks up to her with a submachine gun and begins blasting, killing several people. He confronts the woman last and shoots her dead over her pleas.Suddenly a voice yells ""CUT!!"" The restaurant is actually a movie set and the murdered woman, Ellen Keith (Diane Venora), pops up. The shooting was a illusion created by her boyfriend, Rollie Tyler (Bryan Brown) a visual effects wizard. Tyler, working with his assistant, Andy (Martha Gehman), is approached by a man claiming to be a producer who wants to hire Tyler for his next film. At Rollie's shop in SoHo, the producer, after being scared out of his wits by a giant rubber monster that Rollie has wired to his front door, reveals that he isn't actually in the movie business but is an agent working for the Justice Department named Lipton (Cliff De Young). He wants Rollie to work his expertise in creating the illusion that a mob boss, Nick DeFranco (Jerry Orbach), has been killed publicly. DeFranco is set to testify to a grand jury about the Mafia's inner dealings and Justice wants him to appear murdered until the jury hearing. Rollie is emphatically reluctant at first but when he meets with Lipton's boss, Mason (Mason Adams), he's baited into the job when they mention Rollie's biggest competitor in the business. Rollie decides to take the job.Lipton meets Rollie at his shop and is surprised when he finds Rollie pointing a gun at him. Rollie questions him in a rapid-fire manner and fires a shot with a blank cartridge. Lipton is angered by the exchange but backs off a bit when Rollie shows him how the illusion he'll use works on the monster rigged to his door. It involves a radio transmitter and explosive squibs to simulate bullet hits. Lipton is impressed.Lipton brings DeFranco by to have him rigged for the illusion: Rollie takes a plaster cast of DeFranco's upper chest and head and builds the plates necessary to place the squibs on the mob boss. Mason later meets with Rollie personally and asks him to be the trigger man since he knows the job and can work the equipment better than anyone else. Rollie becomes very reluctant but agrees with the promise that he'll be fully protected.Outside the restaurant where the assassination is planned, Rollie and Lipton get DeFranco ready. Rollie notices Lipton playing with the prop pistol and orders him to put it down. At first DeFranco is hesitant to try the radio box used to trigger the squibs because of his pacemaker but Rollie proves the amperage won't have an effect. DeFranco is sent out to the restaurant and Lipton has Rollie destroy the plaster casting of DeFranco's head.The assassination goes off perfectly and Rollie runs out of the place and jumps in a car with Lipton and a driver. After questioning Rollie about how the stunt went, he pulls a gun on Rollie, saying he's a loose end. Rollie grapples with Lipton and the car careens into a construction site and crashes. Rollie escapes to a pay phone a few blocks away and calls Mason. Mason tells Rollie that Lipton might be a mole they've been looking for. He tells Rollie to stay by the phone and that an NYPD car will pick him up. Rollie gives the phone booth to another person and hides nearby. When the cops show up they riddle the booth with bullets, killing the other caller. Rollie escapes again, going to Ellen's apartment in SoHo. He tries to figure out the turn of events and determines that Mason and Lipton will continue to hunt him.When he and Ellen wake up the next morning, she suggests he call the media. When she steps to the window and opens the curtain, she's immediately shot through the chest. Rollie looks for her killer with a compact mirror and then has to hide when he hears someone approaching the loft door. He surprises the assassin and manages to tie him up briefly. After he checks on Ellen, who's dead, he beats the assassin, demanding to know if he works for Mason. The assassin puts up a good fight but Rollie eventually knocks him cold with a steam iron and beats him to death. Before he leaves her loft, he takes Ellen's body and places it on her bed.The NYPD sends a homicide team to the apartment. One of them, Mickey (Joe Grifasi) calls another detective, Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy) to the scene. After getting some of the details, he reports to police plaza downtown and runs into Lt. Murdoch, who'd just had a meeting with Lipton and Mason about DeFranco's murder. Mason and Lipton had played up the angle that DeFranco had somehow slipped them to get to the restaurant. Though Mason gives Lipton and chewing out, it's a ruse designed to throw Murdoch off the trail. When Leo finds Murdoch, he offers to take the DeFranco murder off his hands -- previously, Leo had been the lead investigator who'd brought DeFranco in. Murdoch refuses to give up the case. Leo checks with a records specialist, Velez (Jossie DeGuzman) and finds out that the dead man in Ellen's apartment, Adams, has virtually no information available as to his current position. Mickey arrives and tells Leo that Ellen and Rollie had been a hot item before her murder and that Rollie had disappeared a couple of days before. Leo charges Mickey with finding Rollie's address and Velez with finding out more about Adams.Rollie places a call to his assistant Andy and tells her to meet him at the boathouse at the Conservatory in Central Park. She arrives, towing a small makeup kit and one of Mason's men. Andy gives the man a boat under the pretext of it being a signal to meet Rollie, but when the man puts the boat in the water, Rollie charges him, pushing him into the pond. Rollie and Andy escape into the park, finding refuge in a hidden chamber under a pedestrian bridge. Rollie explains a little of the situation and disguises them as homeless people. Rollie later calls Mason, using a simple trick with payphones and telling Lipton to meet him at a specific location. When Lipton gets into his car, Rollie throws a garrote around his neck and forces him to drive to a remote location. He takes Andy out of the trunk and puts Lipton in, demanding to know Mason's address. When Lipton refuses, he smashes the rear end of the car into several obstacles until the beaten Lipton agrees to talk.Leo and Mickey enter Rollie's shop without a warrant, scared by the rubber monster. After looking around a bit, Leo finds a connection: the fake bullet hits to the monster match those that killed DeFranco.Before he can clear his name, Rollie needs to get his van out of the impound lot on the West Side. Leo had charged Mickey with watching the van. Rollie and Andy sneak into the lot. Rollie has Andy place several small and harmless explosives around the lot as a distraction. Rollie roars out of the lot and Mickey gives chase, following Rollie through the meatpacking district in Chelsea. Rollie and Andy are able to place a few traps that stop the cops but Mickey persists until Andy throws a mannequin into the street, stopping the chase. Rollie suddenly pulls over, thinking something's wrong with his truck. He fools Andy into stepping out and he takes off, not wanting her to get involved any further.Leo, having found out that DeFranco is staying at Mason's house, wants to go out there and arrest him but his superior officer puts him on suspension for interfering with the case. Leo appears to take it pretty hard but does so to steal the Captain's badge. He goes to Mason's mansion and gets the local police to help him secure the front gate.Meanwhile, Rollie has managed to subdue several of Mason's guards and sneak into the house. He uses sound effects devices and a mirror sheet to fool some of them into killing each other. Rollie also trips a few fuses to cut power to certain rooms. He tricks DeFranco into shooting out several windows in the living room and falls into the room, allegedly shot to death. When DeFranco tries to leave the house, he touches a door rigged by Rollie to shock him. The surge scrambles his pacemaker and he falls to the floor, near death. Mason gets DeFranco to give him the key to a safe deposit box in Geneva that contains all the money he kept or stole from his Mafia days in cash.Rollie finds Mason getting ready to leave the house and hold him at bay with DeFranco's Uzi. Mason tries to talk his way out, giving Rollie the key and promising him a large share of DeFranco's money. Rollie considers it for a moment and lays the Uzi down on a sideboard, hovering over it for a few moments. When Mason grabs the Uzi, Rollie tells him it's unloaded and that he'd smeared Krazy Glue on the grips. Rollie pushes Mason out the front door where he's shot to death by the police when he can't let go of the gun.Leo and the local cops clear the area, finding DeFranco's dead body, as well as that of Rollie. When Rollie's body arrives at the morgue, he slips himself out of the body bag and peels off Latex skin he'd covered his neck and wrists with to fool the paramedics into thinking he had no pulse. He climbs out a window and is stopped immediately by Leo.The story closes with Rollie wearing a mask of DeFranco's face and emptying the safe deposit box in Geneva. He meets Leo outside and the two drive off."
Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091080/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Tommy Jarvis exhumes Jason Voorhees to cremate his corpse, but inadvertently brings him back to life instead. The newly revived killer seeks revenge, and Tommy may be the only one who can stop him. Tommy Jarvis returns to the graveyard to make sure Jason Voorhees is dead and accidentally brings him back to life. Now it's up to Tommy to stop Jason's mindless killing and put him back where he belongs.—Michael Silva <silvamd@cleo.bc.edu> A year after the 'fake' Jason Voorhees (Roy Burns, one of the paramedics who arrived at the scene of Joey's murder within the previous film was killed by Tommy Jarvis. Tommy heads to the 'real' Jason's grave to finally rid himself of Jason for good. However, a sudden lightning strike resurrects Jason to which he once again begins his murder spree. Returning to Camp Crystal Lake (now known as Camp Forest Green), Tommy initially tries to warn the local Police to no avail as he's viewed insane. Though, it's now up to Tommy to stop Jason all by himself this time with the Police hunting him down as well. Superhuman serial killer Jason Voorhees has been dead and buried for six years. However, Tommy Jarvis, who killed Jason in self-defense when he was 12 years old, is still haunted by his encounter, resulting in his having been institutionalized for an extended period of time.Intent on cremating Jason's body to rid himself of his demons, Tommy escapes the mental hospital with his friend, Hawes, and breaks into the cemetery containing Jason's grave. He and Hawes exhume Jason's casket, but before they can cremate the body, an infuriated Tommy begins stabbing it with a steel fence post. The post acts as a conductor for an ongoing lightning storm, and Jason is resurrected from the dead. He kills Hawes with a punch through the heart and throws his body into the exhumed coffin, prompting Tommy to flee the cemetery.Tommy returns to the town of Crystal Lake, the site of Jason's killings, which has now been renamed Forest Green to distance itself from negative publicity. Tommy attempts to warn the town arrogant sheriff, Mike Garris, of Jason's return, but Garris, aware of Tommy's institutionalization, writes him off as disturbed and has him locked in a holding cell.Meanwhile, Jason begins a trek back to the lake that was the site of his drowning as a child. En route, he encounters Lizabeth and Darren, a pair of summer camp supervisors, who are themselves headed to the lake to supervise the re-opening of the summer camp. Jason attacks and kills them, leaving their bodies in the woods.The next morning, Sheriff Garris's daughter, Megan, who is slated to be one of the camp counselors, arrives with her fellow counselors Cort, Sissy, and Paula to report Lizabeth and Darren missing. Tommy cites their disappearance as evidence of Jason's return, but is met with hostility from everyone but Megan, who takes a liking to him. Sheriff Garris sends the counselors off to the campsite and then escorts Tommy out of town; en route, Tommy flees to the cemetery to try and show Garris the open grave, only to discover that the groundskeeper, fearful of being implicated for digging up the grave due to his alcoholism, has covered the grave (and, consequently, Hawes's body) with dirt. Garris handcuffs Tommy and takes him to the city limits, warning him not to return.Meanwhile, a quintent of business people playing paintball in the woods are set upon by Jason, who kills them and steals their supplies. That night, Jason continues making his way back to Crystal Lake, in the process killing the grave digger and a nearby couple having a picnic. Cort meets up with a local girl, Nikki, and leaves the camp to have sex with her in the woods; they end up in Jason's path and are both killed by him. Sheriff Garris ultimately finds the bodies, and believes that Tommy has killed them, living out a delusion of Jason's return.Tommy, meanwhile, has contacted Megan, having figured out a way to defeat Jason after having read books on monsters and folklore: He can be incapacitated by being trapped beneath the surface of the lake where he drowned. Megan attempts to bring Tommy back to the camp, but they are intercepted by one of Garris's roadblocks. Tommy is arrested and Megan is escorted back to the police station to await her father's return from the field. The police's attention on Tommy permits Jason to slip into the summer camp, where he kills Paula and Sissy, but refrains from harming any of the children.Megan and Tommy escape the police station and make it to the lake, where the pursuing police are forced to acknowledge Jason's return when he attacks them. Garris and his deputies briefly incapacitate Jason by shooting him with high caliber weapons, but Jason ultimately recovers and kills them all. He then attempts to kill Megan, but is distracted by Tommy, who beckons to him from the lake. Seemingly remembering Tommy, Jason abandons Megan and wades out to the lake, where Tommy ambushes him with a chain attached to a large boulder. A fight ensues, during which both Tommy and Jason are knocked into the water; as Tommy attempts to swim to the surface, Jason pulls him underwater and he loses consciousness. Megan swims out to save Tommy and is likewise attacked by Jason, but finally incapacitates him by driving a motor boat propeller into his head.Back on land, Megan revives Tommy with CPR and the children celebrate. At the bottom of the lake, Jason floats, attached to the boulder, still alive but powerless to escape."

Watch for Sarah Jessica Parker in one of her first film appearances. Rated PG for language. (Ages 6 and older) --Lynn GibsonA 12-year-old boy named David Freeman (played by Joey Cramer), lives with his parents and younger brother in Florida. On the 4th of July, he is sent to retrieve his brother from his friend's house. David goes through a wooded area and falls down into a ravine, knocking himself out. When he awakens what feels like moments later, he goes back to his house, only to find some other family living inside it! David is reported to the local authorities, who after searching their computer, find that David has been legally declared dead. David is then taken to another house, where he finds his family, now aged. Completely confused, David passes out, and awakes in a hospital, where he learns that 8 years have passed.In order to find out what happened to David, mental tests are conducted at the hospital, showing 'erratic brain patterns,' and even a strange object. This catches the attention of some men at NASA, who have discovered and are harboring a spacecraft very similar to the one that was found in David's brain patterns. Unable to get inside the craft, they think David may hold the key to opening it.The head of the team at NASA, Dr. Faraday (Howard Hesseman), meets with David and his family, and convinces them that he can help them answer the questions they have regarding David's disappearance. David is taken to a special room that is closely monitored at NASA, where he befriends an intern named Carolyn (Sarah Jessica Parker), who visits him regularly with a mechanical helper named R.A.L.F. (Robotic Assisted Living Facilitator). Through her, David learns about what has been going on in the world during the last 8 years, as he's sad to learn that his favorite show 'Starsky and Hutch' was cancelled, and intrigued by 'music videos.'The scientists carry out a series of tests on David's brain. The results reveal alien star charts and other information. Using their equipment, David is shocked when he brain sends electrical impulses to the NASA computer, answering questions that he has no way of knowing. Along with the star charts, the information in David's brain tells the scientists that he has been on the planet Phalon. The scientists surmise that due to David travelling to and from Phalon at the speed of light, this explains why he was able to return 8 years later without having aged. Upset by the whole experience David runs from the room.Some time later, Carolyn appears and tells David that she has overheard that NASA is planning to keep him for a longer stay. David tells Carolyn to tell his parents about this, which she does willingly.The next day, David hears strange voices calling to him. As he listens, the R.A.L.F. robot enters the room, and David gets inside, as the service robot delivers him to the hanger with the spacecraft. As David approaches, the spacecraft opens up, and some steps materialize. Going inside, David finds the ship's pilot, who informs David that his mind contains the star charts he needs to complete his mission. David and the ship manage to escape from NASA, but Dr Faraday and his men are quick to try and follow them.A ways off, David and the ship's pilot have a discussion. The pilot explains that he has been sent to collect specimens from various planets. David was chosen from Earth. As humans do not use all their brain, The ship's pilot decided to fill the extra space with star charts, but the test was unsuccessful, as the information 'leaked.' Due to the frailty of human bodies, the ship was unable to return David to the exact time he came from, which explains why David is now in 1986. After returning David to Earth, the ship crashed into some powerlines, and as a result, it's star charts were erased. David's brain is the only chance the ship has to recover the lost charts and return to Phalon. David then strikes a deal with the alien craft: if David gives him the star charts, the ship will take him home. When the ship classifies itself to David as a ""Tri-maxian Drone Ship,"" David decides to nickname the ship's computer Max.Back at NASA, Dr Faraday is informed that the last person to see David before he got out of his room was Carolyn, who has left the facility. NASA agents track her down to David's family's home, where she has told about David escaping from the facility in the spaceship. Carolyn is returned to NASA for questioning, and David's family is confined to their house, since it is assumed that David will try to return to them.To avoid being found, The ship has plunged into the ocean. As it prepares for the mind-transfer to retrieve the star charts, David finds several other alien specimens that Max has collected. Max claims he will return them back to their own time and planets once he returns David, with the exception of one Called a Pup-muhrr, whose planet was destroyed. David quickly takes a liking to the little creature.Finally, Max is ready, and scans David's brain for the star charts, only to have also scanned in some of David's personality. This gives Max a bit more of a handle on human personality.Eventually, the ship heads towards Florida, where David manages to call his family. Getting ahold of his brother, David explains that he doesn't know where his family's new house is, but his brother assures him that he'll help David find it. Meanwhile, NASA has been tracking David and Max's progress by radar, and surmising he's coming home, send trucks to intercept the ship and David.As night falls, David is able to find the house when his brother sets off fireworks on top of their house. As the ship touches down, Dr Faraday appears, and attempts to coax David away from the ship, along with David's parents. However, instead of leaving the ship, David goes back inside, informing Max to fly off.David explains that he can't stay in 1986, claiming that he'll just be a guinea pig for NASA for the rest of his life. Max once again reiterates that taking David back to 1978 is risky, and he could be vaporized. However, David is willing to take that risk. The two say their goodbyes, as Max then races through space and time.Moments later, David wakes up in the same ravine. As he makes his way home, he hears his Dad calling from the nearby dock, and David smiles, seeing that Max did it, and he is now back in 1978! David acknowledges each of his family members, and as the family takes off in their boat, we see that the little Pup-muhrr has stowed away in David's back pack, and Max can be seen flying overhead, as David is glad to be back home."

As the violent revolutionaries force the captain to fly the crammed-with-people Boeing 707 to Beirut, seasoned deputy commander Major Scott McCoy and his highly trained commandos embark on a suicide mission to rescue the passengers. This time, the men are determined to give the enemy hell and come home in one piece. But this is a dangerous, white-knuckle race against time. Can McCoy's super-soldiers do the impossible and avenge the honour of the United States?—Nick Riganas A 707 aircraft jetliner on its way from Athens to Rome and then to New York is hijacked by two Lebanese terrorists. The terrorists demand that the pilot take them to Beirut. What the terrorists don't realize is that an elite team of commandos led by Major McCoy (Norris) and Colonel Alexander (Marvin) has been called into service to eliminate all terrorists on the jetliner and who's involved in the hijacking and try to retake the plane before the terrorists kill all the hostages.—Shaun Ouimette <xtreemshaun589@hotmail.com> The film opens up on April 24, 1980 during Operation Eagle Claw, the American operation to rescue American hostages being held at the U.S. embassy to Tehran.

Among them is Captain Scott McCoy (Chuck Norris), who, against orders, rescues his wounded comrade Pete Peterson (William Wallace) from the burning helicopter before the team finally evacuates. McCoy expresses his disgust for President Carter as well as the politicians and military hierarchy that forced the mission to launch despite the risks, and announces he is resigning his commission.Five years later, a group of Lebanese terrorists armed with a Colt M1911, PM-63 machine pistol and AK-47s hijack American Travelways Boeing 707 (ATW) Flight 282 that is on a flight from Cairo to Athens to Rome and to New York City.

During the crisis, they separate the Jewish passengers from the Americans by forcing the flight attendant to identify them, who is hesitant to do so because she is German. Unbeknownst to the Lebanese authorities, the Jewish hostages are then taken off the plane and transported to a militant-controlled area of Beirut, while a dozen additional henchmen are brought on board. The plane departs for Algiers, where the terrorists release the female hostages and children.Meanwhile, the Delta Force, led by the veteran Colonel Nick Alexander (Lee Marvin) and McCoy, recalled to active duty.

The Mission,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091530/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Eighteenth-century Spanish Jesuits try to protect a remote South American tribe in danger of falling under the rule of pro-slavery Portugal. Jeremy Irons plays a Spanish Jesuit who goes into the South American wilderness to build a mission in the hope of converting the Indians of the region. Robert De Niro plays a slave hunter who is converted and joins the Jesuit in his mission. When Spain sells the colony to Portugal, they are forced to defend all they have built against the Portuguese aggressors.—mattbballman17 It's the mid-eighteenth century. Unlike his predecessor who was murdered and crucified for his efforts by the people in question, Father Gabriel, a Jesuit priest, is able to gain the trust of the Guaraní to build a mission in their region, above the falls in the border area of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, so that he can bring the word of a Christian god to the Guaraní. Father Gabriel's predecessor's fate was not only because of the Guaraní 's mistrust of him, but their mistrust of the white man in general, they who had previously pilfered many native South American tribes for slaves. Someone who unexpectedly joins Father Gabriel's order in building the mission is Rodrigo Mendoza, a mercenary and slave trader, who is trying to pay penance and repent for some past actions, most specifically an incident involving his half-brother. Father Gabriel's work and the lives of the Guaraní are threatened with the arrival into the area of Cardinal Altamirano, who must decide on the fate of the mission based on the fact that the land on which the mission sits has been ceded by the Spanish to the Portuguese, who are open to enslaving the indigenous peoples as opposed to the Spanish who officially banned the practice despite the former work of people like Mendoza. Cardinal Altamirano will factor into the equation of his decision that the Portuguese may take action against the church as a whole if this one mission is not closed. Father Gabriel and the order have to decide how to proceed, with the possibility that he and Mendoza will end up on different sides of the fence. Mendoza has vowed obedience to Father Gabriel in becoming a priest but may have definite and extreme views based on previously being a mercenary and slave trader. Meanwhile, Father Gabriel wants to protect the Guaraní under the name of God, they who have converted and who are in this position largely because of him.—Huggo Jesuit priest Father Gabriel enters the Guarani lands in South America with the purpose of converting the natives to Christianity. He soon builds a mission, where he is joined by Rodrigo Mendoza, a reformed slave trader seeking redemption. When a treaty transfers the land from Spain to Portugal, the Portuguese government wants to capture the natives for slave labor. Mendoza and Gabriel resolve to defend the mission, but disagree on how to accomplish the task.—Jwelch5742 Father Gabriel ascends the mountains of Brazil to bring christianity to the natives. He is successful and brings about a golden age among them. Mendoza, a slaver, kills his brother in a fit of rage, and only Fr. Gabriel's guidance prevents his suicide. Gabriel brings Mendoza to work at his mission with the natives, and Mendoza finds peace and asks to become a priest. The church, under pressure, cedes the land to the Portuguese which will allow slavers in again. Mendoza breaks his vows and organizes the natives to resist while Gabriel warns him to help them as a priest.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The film is set during the Jesuit Reductions, a program by which Jesuit missionaries set up missions independent of the Spanish state to teach Christianity to the natives. It tells the story of a Spanish Jesuit priest, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), who enters the South American jungle to build a mission and convert a community of Guaraní Indians to Christianity.In the opening scene, a Jesuit missionary is lashed to a cross by the Guarani Indians who live above the spectacular Iguazu Falls. The missionary is then sent over the falls, cross and all, while praying fervently to God. His martyrdom inspires the gentle Father Gabriel to scale the hazardous falls and try to reach out to the tribe. Initially, the Guarani warriors prepare to kill him, but after Gabriel plays an unforgettable solo on his oboe, they allow him to live and he gradually wins their trust.Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) makes his living kidnapping natives and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Cabeza (Chuck Low). Mendoza subsequently finds his fiancee (Cherie Lunghi) and his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn) in bed together. He kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return journey, dragging a heavy bundle containing his armor and sword. After initially tense moments upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, though they recognize him, the natives embrace a tearful Mendoza and cut away his heavy bundle.Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaraní. Moved by the Guaraní's acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson).The Jesuit missions were safe, because they were protected under Spanish law. The Treaty of Madrid (in the year 1750) reapportions the land in South America. The land on which the Jesuit missions were located was transferred to the Portuguese, and Portuguese law allows slavery. The Portuguese colonials seek to enslave the natives, and as the independent Jesuit missions might impede this, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally), a former Jesuit priest himself, is sent from the Vatican to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain.Under pressure from both Cabeza and Portuguese Governor, Don Hontar (Ronald Pickup), Cardinal Altamirano is forced to choose between two evils. If he rules in favor of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if he rules in favour of the missions, the entire Jesuit Order may be condemned by the Portuguese and the European Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their industry and success, both in converting the Indians and, in some cases, economically.At Father Gabriel's mission of San Carlos he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the mission and instructs the Guaraní that they must leave. The Guaraní question his authority, and Father Gabriel and Mendoza, under threat of excommunication, state their intention to defend the mission should the plantation owners and colonists attack. They are, however, divided on how to do this, and they debate how to respond to the impending military attack. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, however, decides to break his vows to militarily defend the Mission. Against Father Gabriel's wishes, he teaches the natives the European art of war and once more takes up his sword.When a joint Portuguese and Spanish force of soldiers attack, the mission is initially defended by Mendoza, Fielding and the Guaraní. They are no match for the military force and Mendoza is shot and fatally wounded. When soldiers enter the mission village, they are slowed by the singing of Father Gabriel and the Guaraní women and children who march in the procession. The soldiers are reluctant to fire at a Mass. In spite of this, the Portuguese commander orders the attack and Father Gabriel, the rest of the priests and most of the Guaraní, including women and children, are gunned down. Only a handful escape into the jungle. Fielding sacrifices himself by killing the Portuguese commander and a few more soldiers before he himself is killed.In a final exchange between Cardinal Altamirano and Don Hontar, Hontar laments that what happened was unfortunate but inevitable because ""we must work in the world; the world is thus."" Altamirano replies, ""No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.""Days later, a canoe of young children return to the scene of the Mission massacre and salvage a few belongings. They set off up the river, going deeper into the jungle, with the thought that the events will remain in their memories. A final title declares that Jesuits and others continue to fight for the rights of indigenous people. The text of John 1:5 is displayed: ""The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."""

Armed and Dangerous,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090660/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A fired cop and useless lawyer sign up as security guards and find they've joined a corrupt union. Frank Dooley (John Candy) , a cop wrongly sacked for corruption, teams up with a useless defense lawyer named Norman Kane (Eugene Levy) in their new careers - as security guards. When the two are made fall guys for a robbery at a location they are guarding, the pair begin to investigate corruption within the company and their union. They soon make enemies of everyone, but can the unlikely duo save the day ?—Rob Hartill Frank Dooley (John Candy) is an ex-cop, thrown out of the force after being framed by corrupt colleagues. Herman Kane (Eugene Levy) is an out of work attorney who quit because he lost his nerve. Both men turn to a private security firm to find employment, but everything goes quickly wrong when the first warehouse they guard gets robbed! Dooley and Kane suspect foul-play, and there's something fishy about the security firm's union, too. Our two heroes decide to investigate, and uncover intrigue and conspiracy, with only their ingenuity and resourcefulness keeping them alive!—Simon N. McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> Officer Frank Dooley (John Candy), a 10-year veteran of the LAPD, is framed for the theft of a television set by two corrupt detectives (who Dooley had actually caught robbing an appliance store). He is dismissed from the force, but escapes criminal punishment at his day in court.The next court case features hapless and nervous defense attorney named Norman Kane (Eugene Levy) attempting to defend a Charles Manson-type white supremacist cult leader named Lawrence Lupik (Glenn Withrow), who threatens to kill him should Kane fail to keep him out of prison. A fearful Kane reveals his ineptitude and the death threat to the judge (Stacy Keach, Sr.), who tells Kane that he will give Lupik ""A sentence so long he won't even remember his own name, let alone yours"" so long as Kane agrees to find another line of work with a ""lot less responsibility"".Dooley and Kane meet for the first time when they both apply for work at Guard Dog Security, a low-rent firm run by the gruff ""Captain"" Clarence O'Connell (Kenneth McMillan) and part of a security guard's union requiring heavy $15 a week contributions that is represented by Clyde Klepper (Jonathan Banks) and Tony Lazarus (Brion James). Becoming licensed armed security guards after a single afternoon of training, Dooley and Kane are made partners by Guard Dog supervisor Maggie Cavanaugh (Meg Ryan) and assigned to night duty at the Carlex Pharmaceutical Company's warehouse.During their first night, after being loudly ordered to take a lunch break by senior guard Bruno (Tom Lister, Jr.), Kane happens upon an armed robbery of the warehouse and quickly calls over the radio to Frank for help, but they prove no match for the thieves (the robbers are Klepper and Lazarus in ski masks) who used machine guns. Kane unwittingly escapes into the ""Annex"" where Bruno had told them to stay away from as it was guarded by the K9 Patrol (Rottweiler's and Doberman's). In there he is chased by the dogs until Frank shows up and fights them off with unusual tactics, including biting one and punching another.The next day, the pair are berated and fined $100 each by O'Connell for their screw up in not nabbing or identifying the thieves despite their contention that they had machine guns and were wearing ski masks. This leaves them suspicious of the company as they hadn't done anything to warrant the hefty fine (almost a week's pay). When Maggie asks about the meeting afterwards, both men vent their anger about O'Connell (Dooley calls him a jerk while Kane calls him a ""Sub-human, moronic, poop head""), only to be informed by Maggie that O'Connell is actually her father.Dooley and Kane then attend a meeting of the union, where after getting turned down in their plea to have the fine revoked and it being revealed that Klepper and Lazarus work for Carlino, Kane pointedly questions union president Michael Carlino (Robert Loggia) about how the union dues each member is required to pay are spent (roughly $4 million per year). After Kane rejects an evasive answer from Union treasurer Lou Brackman (James Tolkan), an enraged Carlino threatens to break Kane's legs should he ever attend another union meeting and then abruptly adjourns the meeting.Over the next few days, Dooley and Kane find themselves assigned to work at a landfill and a toxic waste dump, causing both to come to the conclusion that the assignments are the result of Kane speaking out at the union meeting. At the toxic waste dump, Dooley and Kane listen to a similar story by two burned-out guards about a robbery incident over three weeks ago when they were on warehouse duty and forced to take their lunch break by Bruno which resulted in the warehouse getting robbed while they were away.Convinced something illegal is afoot, the pair track down Bruno at his gym and interrogate him. With the threat of heavy weights crashing down on his head, Bruno confesses that it was O'Connell who had called him that night and instructed him order them to lunch the night of the robbery. After getting Bruno go, the bumbling duo make a quick escape from the gym while an angry Bruno chases after them on foot.The pair then visit an old friend of Dooley's, a retired thief named Cappy (Tony Burton) to get information on Carlino. Upon learning of Carlino's corruption (which cost Kane a weeks pay in bribes for information as Cappy wouldn't take money from Dooley), they bring their suspicions to Maggie, but she rejects them as having no evidence to back them up.Dooley and Kane next crash a formal dinner party thrown by Carlino in hopes of gathering some evidence. Eavesdropping on a meeting between Carlino and Brackman, they learn of Carlino's use of the union's pension fund to finance dealings with a Colombian drug cartel and his plans to have the money robbed from an armored car, with insurance covering the loss. Fearing an investigation by the insurance company in which he will be the fall guy for turning the fund into cash, Brackman urges Carlino not to go through with the robbery. In response, Carlino instructs Klepper and Lazarus to dispose of him. Dooley and Kane attempt to save Brackman, but are too late to prevent his murder and instead find themselves framed for his death. At the party, Maggie asks O'Connell about what is happening, he refuses to give her any answer and tells her to stay out of his business.A long chase beings as Dooley and Kane are chased by Carlino's henchmen from the Hollywood Hills and through downtown L.A., and evade them, only to run into the police which their car goes off the road. After hiding out in a porno bookstore and peep show, Dooley and Kane evade the bad cops looking for them by somehow dressing up as outlandish gay couple (Dooley being a 'Divine' lookalike and Kane as a leatherman), the two spend the rest of the night evading the police.In the morning, the cross-dressing duo meet with the receptive and amused Maggie where they reveal Carlino's intentions and make plans to prevent the armored car robbery. Kane and Maggie take over driving the truck, while Dooley plans to meet them ahead of the would-be robbers. On the 6th Street Bridge, Dooley has problems with his motorcycle and is forced to hitch a ride with ""Cowboy"" (Steve Railsback), a wild trucker who eagerly disobeys traffic laws and uses his truck to ram his way through a traffic jam (while hauling VERY flammable rocket fuel).Meanwhile, Kane and Maggie avoid assaults from multiple cars attempting to hold them up. With the Cowboy's help, Dooley is able to arrive in time to save the armored car from a guided missile strike and foil a final attack from Klepper and Lazarus with his illegal .50 caliber handgun (Dooley tells The Cowboy that they only used the gun to hunt Buffalo ""up close"", and that its only legal in two states, but California wasn't one of them). O'Connell, a willing partner of Carlino's, no longer willing to abide the scheme after Carlino threatened to hurt Maggie if he didn't co-operate with the robbery, arrives having captured Carlino and his associates, the two detectives who originally framed Dooley and had him thrown off the police force.The criminals are arrested and the Police Chief (Bruce Kirby) invites Dooley back to the police force as a plain clothed detective... along with a reluctant Kane who wants to go back to the relative safety of being a lawyer."

Norman meets three new people, one being a beautiful young nun with whom his budding relationship is beginning to make his ""Mother"" jealous.

He meets three new people who come to the Motel: a beautiful young woman who has left the convent named Maureen (Diane Scarwid), a guitarist desperate for money named Duke (Jeff Fahey) and a nosy reporter named Tracy Venable (Roberta Maxwell), who is writing an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. As Norman and Maureen begin having a romantic relationship, someone dressed as Mother begins to kill people around the Motel one-by-one. Is Norman taking orders from Mother again, is Tracy trying too hard to prove that Norman is a viscous serial killer, or is there something much more than the obvious?—btrocksyoursocks The film begins with Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell for what she did. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.She walks through the desert for a while, and finally reaches a highway. A beat-up car approaches and passes her, but backs up upon seeing her. The driver, Duane Duke (Jeff Fahey) offers her a ride. She puts her suitcase in the backseat and in doing so, bumps his guitar. He tells her to be careful with it, because it is his ""bread and butter""--he is on his way to Los Angeles to make it big as a rock-n'-roll singer. She says that she's having car problems, and that the problem is that there is no car.They continue driving into the night during a heavy rainstorm. Duane can barely see ahead of him but keeps on driving aggressively, and the car begins to weave between the lanes. The car is having engine problems, and a loud popping sound causes Duane to swerve the car to the other side of the road. Duane pulls the car off the road, and tells Maureen that they aren't going any further, due to the storm. He advises her to try to get some sleep. During the middle of the night, it is still raining, and Duane makes a pass at her. She struggles to fight him off, and slaps his face. She gets out of the car, and he angrily tosses her suitcase out into a muddy puddle. Duane drives off, leaving Maureen sobbing.The next morning at the Bates Motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) collects some dead birds in a paper sack from the ground, thanks to some poisoned birdseed he kept in a birdfeeder, and stuffs them in the kitchen using his taxidermy supplies. On the table is a newspaper opened up to an article entitled, ""Spool Still Missing."" Norman has a flashback of him killing Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar, from the end of Psycho II), and when he looks down at the bird he is stitching up, he instead sees a hand and arm being stitched together! He is startled when the paper sack moves along the tabletop by itself, and is relieved to see a healthy bird pop out. Norman carefully grasps the bird in his hands and releases it outside. He hears a car horn blaring, and comes down to meet Duane. Duane is interested in the ""help wanted"" sign posted on the office window. Norman offers him a job as an assistant manager for the motel, and Duane accepts, mentioning that he only wants to stay long enough to earn money to fix his car to go to L.A.Norman goes off to the diner (Statlers) where he used to work to get some food. At the diner, Ralph Statler (Robert Alan Browne)--the owner--is having a conversation with Sheriff John Hunt (Hugh Gillin) about Emma Spool. He is confused as to why she would suddenly not show up for work a month ago and disappear, after normally being a stellar employee since he took over the diner from the previous owner, Harvey Leach (Hugo L. Stanger) seven years earlier. --Sheriff Hunt says that her apartment has been searched and nothing seems out of the ordinary. Ralph hopes that nothing serious has happened to her, displaying a worried look on his face. Tracy Veneble (Roberta Maxwell), a nosy magazine reporter, chimes in and suggests that Norman may have had something to do with her disappearance. She came from L.A. to interview Norman about the subject of the insanity defense and the rehabilitation of mentally ill murderers.Sheriff Hunt and Ralph argue with her and tell her to leave him alone in peace. Just then, Norman walks in and sits down in a booth. He orders a meal and gets an order of burgers to go. Tracy sits down across from him and starts to ask him some questions. He opens up to her and explains that what happened to him in the past stays with him and he can't escape the reality of what he did. As they are talking, Maureen gets out of a semi truck and comes into the diner. Norman is horrified to see her initials on her suitcase--""M.C."" Norman has a flashback to the murder of Marion Crane from 22 years earlier-he notices that Maureen is almost an exact look-alike to Marion. He pays for the food and quickly leaves while Tracy keeps droning on and on.Back at the motel, Duane sees an exhausted Maureen walking toward the highway. He apologizes to her for his behavior the night before (he says he was road-weary) and offers her a motel room that she can rest in. She pays him $25 for the room, and he gives her the key to cabin #1. As she leaves, Duane keeps the $5 bill she gave him, folds over the edge of one corner, and puts it in his pocket. Norman walks by and sees her going into the room. He freaks out and goes back to the house. Norman has a conversation with ""Mother (Virginia Gregg's voice),"" the stuffed corpse of Mrs. Spool. He tells ""her"" about Maureen resembling Marion, and ""she"" tells him to get rid of her if her presence upsets him. He refuses, and Mother says that maybe she will do it instead.Maureen unpacks her suitcase in cabin 1. She sees a copy of the Bible on the nightstand, and she has a traumatic memory of her actions at the convent. She starts to cry. In Fairvale, Duane goes into a bar and sees Tracy Veneble. He introduces himself to her and lights her cigarette for her. She initially is turned off by him, but when she sees his Bates Motel matchbook, she decides to have a talk with him.In the motel office parlor, Norman takes a picture off the wall, and looks through a peephole into cabin 1. He sees Maureen stripping and going into the bathroom nude. Norman goes back up to the house and puts on his ""Mother"" costume and goes back to cabin 1 to kill her. Maureen is in the shower, and ""Mother"" pulls back the shower curtain. Maureen is sitting in a tub of rising bloody water. A razor blade sits nearby. She lifts up her hands to reveal that her wrists were slit, with blood gushing out of the wounds. Due to her blood loss, Maureen hallucinates that ""Mother"" is the Virgin Mary coming to save her.Meanwhile, Duane and Tracy continue talking about Norman. Tracy says she will pay Duane for any information he gives her. Unexpectedly, she gets up and leaves. Duane notices a red-haired girl (Juliette Cummins) staring at him.At St. Matthew's Hospital, Maureen is in a room recovering from her suicide attempt. Father Brian (Gary Bayer), a psychiatrist, is sitting by her bedside and introduces himself to her. Outside her room, Norman and Sheriff Hunt are waiting. Tracy shows up and claims that she happened to be passing by the motel and saw the ambulance leaving and decided to follow it. She asks how Norman found out about Maureen. Sheriff Hunt chimes in and says he was bringing fresh towels to Maureen's motel room when he found her in the bathtub after she cut her wrists and he used her room phone to call for an ambulance, repeating what Norman had told him. Father Brian comes out and tells Norman that Maureen wants to see him.Maureen thanks Norman for finding her and calling for help. He is just glad that he was looking out for someone else. He tells her that she can stay at the motel for free as long as she wants until she gets better and can sort her life out. He leaves her room to let her rest, and goes back home. He accuses Mother of hurting Maureen, and says that he is glad that Maureen didn't die. Mother replies, ""She will!""Duane brings the red-haired girl back to the motel. They overhear Norman yelling at Mother. They just assume the noise is due to a loud TV. Red tries to open the ice chest next to the office to get some ice, but it is locked. She bumps into Norman and falls to the ground. He opens the chest for her and she gets some ice and asks him to join her and Duane; he politely declines.Red and Duane make love, and later she comes out of the shower. She goes over to Duane to kiss some more and he isn't interested anymore. She is upset because she wants this relationship to be more than just a one-night fling, and he tells her to leave and gives her $5 for cab fare, the same $5 that Maureen used to help pay for cabin #1. He tosses her and her clothes out the door. She puts her clothes on and goes into to a phone booth nearby to call for a cab. She realizes she put her shirt on backward and takes it off to put it back on correctly. Suddenly, Mother's hand bursts through the glass door, opens it, and stabs her over and over again. Red struggles to fight off Mother's attack, and she severely cuts the bottoms of her bare feet from stumbling on the glass shards on the floor, blood squishing out. Red crumples to the ground and Mother turns around and leaves. Back at the house, Norman cries, ""Mother! Oh God, Mother! Blood! Blood!""The next morning, Duane comes out of his cabin and sees Norman scrubbing the glass walls of the phone booth with soapy water. Duane goes into the office and sees that the $5 bill he gave Red for cab fare is in the cash drawer.At the hospital, Maureen is having a counseling session with Father Brian. She tells him that it was her idea to become a nun, but that as the time grew close to take her final vows of celibacy, she became scared and was dwelling on lustful thoughts. Father Brian asks her why she didn't just leave the novitiate, rather than be tormented by those thoughts.Duane talks to Tracy at the motel about the $5 bill he discovered in the drawer. She tells him it may have helped solve the mystery if he knew the girl's name. The motel is bustling with activity because Fairvale's homecoming football game is later in the day, and several guests have checked into rooms. Norman and Maureen arrive in a cab, and he sees Tracy going up to the house. She wants to continue her interview with him, but he stops her and tells her to leave and never come back. Norman goes into cabin 1, and Maureen is pleased to find that Norman had her wet clothes sent to the dry-cleaner's. He tells her that she'll look good in her pink dress on their dinner date later on.At Mrs. Spool's apartment, Tracy talks with the landlord. He says that other than coming and going for work, Mrs. Spool stayed home. The landlord leaves, and Tracy decides to stay and snoop for a while. She glances at some magazines on a coffee table and a single phone number is written on the covers several times. She dials the number on the phone, and she discovers that it connects her to the Bates Motel.That evening, Norman takes Maureen out to eat at a fancy restaurant in Fairview. After eating, they get up to dance. At first, Maureen doesn't feel comfortable, but Norman teaches her the basic ""box"" step movements.Back at the motel, a cab drops Maureen and Norman off. Maureen goes into her room, and Norman follows soon after. He sees her staring toward the house. He asks her what is wrong, and she says that she must have had too much to drink--she thought she saw a woman up in the window at the house. Uncomfortable, Norman goes to tell Duane that he can take off for the night, and then goes back to Maureen. She tells him she enjoyed her time with him earlier. They lay down on the bed and kiss. Norman stops kissing her, and he says he doesn't feel right about this. Maureen eases his discomfort by suggesting they just lie on the bed and hold each other.Later that night, Maureen is asleep and Norman is gone. Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Reuben), a guest from another cabin, comes in to wake her and warns her about the door being left wide open. She tells Maureen that she'll close it for her, in case one of her drunk friends might happen to wander inside.Up at the house, Mother scolds Norman for letting Maureen come between them. She starts whispering something to him, and he is about to put on the dress and wig. Maureen comes up to the front door and calls out his name. Mother tells him to bring her the knife. He is shocked to see her dead body sit up in bed. Norman takes the knife in his hand, wraps his fingers around the blade, and slams his hand down on a table. He yelps in pain. Concerned, Maureen asks what is wrong. He feigns ill, and tells her to go back to her cabin and lock her door. Soon after, Norman leaves, dressed to kill.Meanwhile, Patsy Boyle is looking for a bathroom to use. She sees the one in the parlor, and sits down on the toilet to relieve herself. Suddenly, she looks up in surprise and sees Mother standing directly in front of her. She tells Mother that the bathroom is ""occupied,"" and Mother thrusts the knife, slitting her throat, and stabbing her in the stomach. Patsy keels over and falls to the floor. Later, Norman goes into the parlor looking for Duane, and he recoils in shock from seeing the bloody mess. Norman takes her body out of the bathroom and tosses it out the window behind the motel. Some partiers are chasing each other around the building, and Norman hides himself and the body momentarily. The guests all get into their cars and leave, burning rubber on their way out to the highway.The next morning, Maureen comes out of her cabin to see the sheriff's car outside. Worried, she asks about Norman. Tracy is there too, and she decides it's time to tell Maureen the truth about Norman. Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo (Steve Guevara) are investigating the disappearance of Patsy Boyle. She didn't ride home with the other revelers, and they go up to the house where they question Norman about it. Norman figures that Tracy assumed he was involved. Deputy Leo searches the first floor level, and then goes to search upstairs. Terrified that they'll discover Mrs. Spool's corpse, Norman runs up after him, with Sheriff Hunt in pursuit. Norman sees that there is no body in Mother's room. Bewildered by Norman's antics, Hunt and Leo leave.Shortly after, Norman is sitting by the ice machine by the motel. Sheriff Hunt apologizes to Norman for their intrusion, and he opens the ice chest to grab a couple of ice cubes to suck on. There are human fingers sticking up out of the ice, but he doesn't see them. He puts bloody ice cubes in his mouth (he doesn't notice this-he grabs them without looking at them) and vehemently ignores Tracy's pleas to take Norman in for questioning about the disappearances of Mrs. Spool and Patsy, because there is no proof that he did anything. Maureen lies to Hunt, and claims that she was with Norman until 6:00 that morning, so he couldn't have done anything wrong. Hunt and Leo leave, and Tracy waits for Maureen to get in her car--she told her everything about Norman, and Maureen tells a disappointed Norman that she'll stay with Father Brian for a while. They drive off.Norman looks around the house looking for Mother. She is nowhere to be found. In the kitchen, he sees a note from Mother: ""Norman--I'm in cabin 12. Come see me."" Norman walks along the front of the motel and approaches cabin 12, which is Duane's cabin. On the TV is a Woody Woodpecker cartoon. Mother is sitting in front of the TV. On the bed, Duane--high on drugs and alcohol--plays his guitar.""What are you doing with my mother?"" Norman asks him.Duane replies, ""Don't you mean, Mummy?"" in a mocking tone. Norman asks him why he took her and left the note for him to find.""I'm just looking out for you Norman,"" says Duane.""And yourself,"" Norman says.Duane continues, ""I have ambitions--dreams, but dreams don't come cheap these days. I could've turned 'mom' over to the cops this afternoon, but all I would've gotten was a pat on the back for doing my civic duty."" He tells her that Tracy would've payed him a big sum of money, but figures that she would lie and take all the credit and earn a big salary and earn a news position somewhere.Duane blackmails Norman into selling the house and motel in order to give Mother over to Norman. Norman tells him that he wants Mother back. Duane tells him he can take her--Duane says, ""You know what I want, and you know what I'll do if I don't get it.""Norman hits Duane in the head with an ashtray. A violent fight breaks out with Norman hitting Duane with a lamp, and ultimately, hitting Duane with his own guitar. ""Watch the guitar,"" Duane mumbles. Norman hits him with the guitar repeatedly, until the guitar is broken into several pieces. Duane crumples to the floor, unconscious.At the diner, Ralph, Myrna (Lee Garlington)--a waitress, and Tracy are discussing Mrs. Spool. Ralph tells Tracy that Mrs. Spool was a good employee, and was already working there when Ralph bought the place. Tracy asks about the diner's former owner, Harvey Leach, in the hopes that she can find out more about Mrs. Spool from him. Myrna says that Harvey is in a nursing home outside of town. Tracy visits Harvey, and she asks him about Mrs. Spool. He tells her that Emma had been put in an asylum for killing someone.At Father Brian's office, Maureen has decided to forgive Norman and wants to be back with him. She has failed other people before, but she won't fail him.At a library, Tracy looks through old archived newspaper articles, and is shocked to see a headline reading: ""Sister arrested in Bates Murder-Kidnapping."" Below it is a sub-heading: ""Child Unharmed in Love Triangle Tragedy.""In Duane's motel room, Norman removes his belongings and wraps his body in the shower curtain. ""I'll be back for you mother,"" Norman says. Norman opens the ice chest and tries to remove Patsy's body from it. One of her arms is wedged against the top of the chest and won't move, and Norman tries with all his strength to pull it loose, but the arm snaps off. He finally gets the body out of the ice chest, and he kisses her on the lips before putting her in the trunk of Duane's car. Norman puts Duane's body in the back seat of the car and drives it over to the swamp. On the way, Duane wakes up and wraps a cord around Norman's neck. Startled, Norman slams his foot down on the brake pedal and the momentum causes Duane to lurch forward into the front passenger seat.Norman pins Duane down on the floor of the car with his foot, and the other foot accidentally presses down on the gas pedal, sending the car into the swamp. As the car fills with water, Norman sees Duane drowning. Norman manages to escape the flooding car and swims away from it. He struggles to see in the murky water, navigating through underwater weeds. He lets out a scream when he sees Red's body--her pale, expressionless face staring back at him. He surfaces, and crawls his way out of the swamp.Meanwhile, Tracy shows copies of the newspaper articles to Father Brian, hoping that if Maureen would see them, she could change her story to the police. He tells her Maureen already left and went back to the motel.In her room, Maureen has showered and put on a nightgown. She hears Norman running up the steps to the house, and she calls out to him. He ignores her and runs into the house. She walks up to the house and enters it. As she walks up the staircase, she calls out to Norman again and explains that she has returned. She says that she never should have left and she forgives him for what happened to him in the past, and emphasizes that he saved her life. Norman appears at the top of the stairs. She asks him what happened. He lies and says that he slipped in the mud.She says that she regrets hurting him by leaving, and asks for his forgiveness. They hold each other's hands and have a brief tender moment. Suddenly, Mother yells, ""Norman!"" Surprised by this, Norman lets go of Maureen's hands, sending her falling backward down the stairs, arms flailing. At the bottom of the stairs, her skull is pierced by the arrow of the cupid statue against the wall. She crumples to the floor... dead. Norman, in shock, runs down the stairs and sees that blood is pooling around her head. He angrily yells ""Mother!!"" at the top of his lungs.Tracy drives up to the motel, and, carrying a tire iron, checks Maureen's cabin. She overhears Mother saying to Norman, ""You get that whore out of my house. Throw it out in the muck and filth where she belongs!"" Norman says, ""I'll get you for this, Mother."" Mother replies back, ""You haven't got the guts, boy!""Tracy goes up to the house and tries to open the front door, but it's locked. She goes around the back and enters the kitchen. She slowly walks through the hallway into the foyer, and sees the living room lit up with dozens of candles. She sees Maureen's body laying on the couch, with a lit candle positioned in her grasped hands. With pity, she says, ""You dumb, stupid naive girl."" She turns around and is shocked to see Norman dressed up as Mother, his mouth fixed in a wide, skeletal smile. ""Why can't you leave my poor son, my Norman, alone?"" says Mother. Tracy drops the tire iron and tries to escape from him. She begins to go up the stairs, with Norman slowly in pursuit.""What set you off again, Norman? Was it Mrs. Spool? You killed her, didn't you? What did she do--come to you and tell you she was your mother? She was crazy, Norman--she wasn't your mother, and neither are you!"" She reaches the tops of the stairs, Norman still following her. ""Mrs. Spool was your aunt, Norman. She was in love with your father, but your mother stole him away from her! Emma Spool killed your father in a jealous rage and kidnapped you when you were just a baby!"" In Mother's room, she turns around and lets out a horrified shriek when she sees Mrs. Spool's corpse sitting in a chair. ""She killed your father because she thought you were her child--the child she should have had with him! She was crazy--they locked her away!""Mother says, ""It's lies! It's all lies! She's a lying whore. She's a slut! Don't let her talk about me like that!"" Norman, seemingly free of Mother's spell, takes off the wig and dress. ""Get her boy, get her! Just like all the others!"" continues Mother. Norman raises the knife, and it looks as though he is going to attack Tracy, but instead, Norman stabs Mrs. Spool's body at the neck. ""Norman! Can't you do anything right?"" says Mother. Norman continues hacking at the neck, with sawdust spraying out. ""How dare you treat your mother that way!"" The corpse slides out of the chair and onto the floor. Norman hacks with the knife until the head is completely severed and rolls to the side. ""So I don't have the guts, huh?"" taunts Norman. Exhausted, Norman rests his head on the chair.The next morning, Sheriff Hunt leads Norman away from the house in handcuffs. A TV news crew is there filming. Tracy and Father Brian are both in shock. Hunt is in total disbelief with Norman, telling him that he believed in him and had faith in him and now that Norman, as ""Mother"" killed more people. He puts Norman in the back of the squad car, and tells him, ""You'll never get out again! They'll lock you up forever!"" In response, Norman replies, ""But I'll be free. I'll finally be free.""As the squad car drives along the highway, Norman reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a victory trophy: the severed rotting hand of Mrs. Spool. He gently caresses it as he smiles as the image fades to black."
The Mosquito Coast,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091557/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An inventor spurns his city life and moves his family into the jungles of Central America to make a utopia. An eccentric and dogmatic inventor sells his house and takes his family to Central America to build a utopia in the middle of the jungle. Conflicts with his family, a local preacher, and with nature are only small obstacles to his obsession. Based on the novel by Paul Theroux.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> American Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) is a genius, especially when it comes to anything mechanical, and an idealist. He dropped out of Harvard to become an inventor, he now with nine patents and six pending. He loves the U.S., but is disillusioned by what it has become in so many different facets. As such, he unilaterally decides to uproot his family - his wife, who he affectionately calls ""Mother"" (Dame Helen Mirren), their two sons Charlie (River Phoenix) and Jerry (Jadrien Steele), and their twin daughters April (Hilary Gordon) and Clover (Rebecca Gordon) - from their comfortable New England life to move to the jungles of Central America, most specifically Mosquitia. There, he hopes to start from scratch to build a society closer to his own ideals, his utopia. He believes he is doing this not just for himself, but for his family, as he wants his children to learn from real-life as opposed to books. Allie will learn that he may have his own view of what he wants to achieve, but that there are external forces, both human and non-human, that may conspire against him. Outwardly, chief amongst his human obstacles is missionary Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory), whose work Allie believes is solely narcissistic propaganda. In turn, Reverend Spellgood believes Allie is a Communist. But what may be lurking underneath the surface as another obstacle is Allie's own family, who may ultimately rebel against something in which they had no input, especially as Allie has a policy of anyone being free to leave if they want, but be excommunicated from the family forever. Allie, too, will have to decide how far he will go to achieve his ultimate dream.—Huggo Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) has never been a man to do things by the book. An avid inventor, he is a troubled genius given to intense moods and an incredible drive. Seemingly on a whim, he shifts his family to the jungles of Central America, telling his children that America ""is gone"". Determined to create a civilization better than the one he has abandoned, Fox's obsession and mania might pull his family through, or it might pull them apart.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> The film opens with Charlie Fox (River Phoenix) explaining that his father, Allie Fox (Harrison Ford), is a brilliant inventor with ""nine patents, six pending."" Allie has grown fed up with the American Dream and American consumerism, believing that Americans ""buy junk, sell junk and eat junk,"" and that there is an impending nuclear war on the horizon as a result of American greed and crime.Allie and Charlie go to a hardware store to buy components for a new invention, an ice machine known as Fat Boy. Upon seeing that the product was made in Japan, Allie refuses to purchase it. After Allie and Charlie acquire the components at a local dump, he finishes assembling his creation. Allie's boss and asparagus farm owner, Mr. Polski (Dick O'Neill) complains that Allie is not tending to the asparagus, which is rotting. Allie, Charlie, and Allie's youngest son, Jerry (Jadrien Steele), meet Mr. Polski, and Allie shows him ""Fat Boy."" The machine leaves Polski unimpressed. As he drives past the fields, a dejected Allie comments on immigrants picking asparagus, and says that where they come from, they might think of ice as a luxury. The home of the migrant workers is in a state of disarray, exemplifying their poverty.That night, Jerry tells ""Mother"" (Helen Mirren), that he believes something terrible is about to happen. Mother rebuffs her son, explaining that she believes something good will happen. The next morning, Allie throws a party for the immigrant workers before telling his family that they're leaving the United States. After they board a Panamanian barge, the family meets Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory), a Christian missionary, his wife (Melanie Boland), and their daughter, Emily (Martha Plimpton). Emily flirts with Charlie. Allie and the Reverend begrudgingly try to get along, despite having entirely different religious views. When the barge docks in Belize City, the families disembark and go their separate ways. Allie, with the consent of the Belize government, purchases a small village called Jeronimo in the rainforest along the river.Mr. Haddy (Conrad Roberts) takes Allie and his family upriver to Jeronimo. Allie meets the inhabitants and proceeds to start building a new, 'advanced' civilization, in the process inventing many new things. The locals take kindly to Allie and his family, but Allie's will to build a utopic civilization keeps them working to their limits. One day, Reverend Spellgood arrives to convert Jeronimo's citizens. In the process, Allie and Spellgood angrily denounce each other, leading to a permanent schism: Allie believes Spellgood to be a religious zealot; Spellgood believes Allie to be a communist. Allie sets to constructing a huge version of ""Fat Boy"" that can supply Jeronimo with ice. Upon completing the machine, Allie hears rumors of a native tribe in the mountains that have never seen ice. Allie recruits his two sons to carry a load of ice into the jungle to supply the tribe. Upon arriving, Allie finds that the load has melted, and that the tribe has already been visited by missionaries.When Allie returns to Jeronimo, he learns that Spellgood has left with much of the populace, scaring them with stories of God's biblical destruction. The near-empty town is visited by rebels, who demand to use Jeronimo as a guerrilla base. Allie and his family accept to accommodate them while Allie constructs a plan to be rid of them. Set on freezing them to death, Allie bunks the rebels up in the giant ice machine, tells Charlie to lock its only other exit, and activates it. The rebels, waking in panic, try to shoot their way through. To Allie's horror, the rebels' gunfire sets off an explosion within the machine. By the next morning, both the machine and the family's home is in ruins. Worse, the chemicals from the destroyed machine have severely polluted the river.Forced downstream, Allie and his family arrive at the coast. Mother and the children rejoice, believing they can return to the United States. Allie, refusing to believe his dream has been shattered, announces that they have all they need on the beach and, lying, tells the family that America has been destroyed in a nuclear war. Settling on the beach in a houseboat he has built, and refusing assistance from Mr. Haddy, a paranoid Allie believes that the family has accomplished building a utopia. One night, the storm surge from a tropical cyclone nearly forces the family out to sea until Charlie reveals that he has been hiding motor components given to him by Mr. Haddy, allowing them to start the motor on the boat. The family becomes physically and emotionally weaker for lack of food, shelter, and other human companionship.Traveling upstream once again, the family stumbles across Spellgood's compound. Coming ashore, Allie sees barbed wire, and mutters that the settlement is a Christian concentration camp. While the rest of the family sleeps, Charlie and Jerry sneak over to the Spellgood home. After finding out that the United States was not destroyed and that Emily will assist them in escaping from Allie, Charlie obtains the keys to a jeep. Before Charlie can convince Mother and his sisters to leave, Allie sets Spellgood's church on fire. Spellgood shoots Allie, paralyzing him from the neck down. The family escapes aboard the boat.The film concludes with the group traveling downriver again, where Allie drifts in and out of consciousness. Allie asks his wife if they are going upstream. She lies to himgoing against the wishes of her husband for the first time. Charlie's final narration reports the death of Allie, but gives hope that the rest of the family can live their lives freely from now on."
Sweet Liberty,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092035/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After selling the rights of his book to a movie production company, a writer finds himself fighting the many egos and varying views around him. Specializing in the American Revolution, Pulitzer Prize winning Dr. Michael Burgess teaches History at a college in Sayeville, NC. Beyond his research, teaching and writing, his life is preoccupied by fencing, attending to his delusional mother, Cecelia Burgess, and navigating a relationship with Literature professor Gretchen Carlsen, she resisting his request to move in together, while he can see that she probably wants to get married instead. Because of the authenticity in locations, a Hollywood movie crew descends on the town to film a version of Michael's novel, Sweet Liberty, he proud of its historical accuracy and its accessibility to readers who may not be familiar with the American Revolution. While most in town become star struck in all that the movie means, the one noticeable exception is Michael upon discovering that the script has little to nothing to do with his book, including not being historically accurate. Screenwriter Stanley Gould, known more for being a hack, accepts Michael's assistance in rewriting the script in seeing it as his transition to the A-list, and as such being the liaison to those that matter, namely Director Bo Hodges, and stars Elliott James and Faith Healy. Bo solely wants to make a movie that caters to the lowest common denominator of the movie-going public, but Stanley knows the way to Bo is through Elliott and Faith who have more clout. Michael and Stanley may have some issue with Elliott, who likes to exemplify his hyper-masculine on-screen persona in his personal life, especially as it pertains to the opposite sex despite being married. The issue with Faith is that Michael starts to fall for her, he arguably falling for her characterization, how he depicted her in his book, rather than Faith as a fully formed human being, one shaped by being a famous Hollywood actress.—Huggo"
One Crazy Summer,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091680/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An aspiring teenage cartoonist and his friends come to the aid of a singer trying to save her family property from developers. With a name like Hoops McCann, he's bound to get that basketball scholarship after high school, right? Wrong! What Hoops really wants to do is write and illustrate a love story. To help him find his way, his friend George invites Hoops to come with him and his sister to spend the summer on Nantucket. The friends Crazy Summer begins when they pickup Cassandra on the way--she's being chased by a motorcycle gang. From here on in, it only gets crazier. Once on the island, Hoops and George, along with George's island friends the Stork twins and Ack-Ack (son of a marine), must help Cassandra save her grandfather's house from the greedy Beckersted Family. Along the way, Hoops must find a way to write his cartoon love story - and maybe a real one of his own.—April M. Cheek <Aravis2713@aol.com> Cartoonist ""Hoops"" McCann (John Cusack) works on a scholarship application to the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), before rushing off to attend his high school graduation ceremony. Hoops comes from a long-line of professional basketball players (his father and grandfather, great-grandfather, etc.) but was rejected for a sports scholarship to his college of choice due to his poor basketball performance on the school team of not scoring a single hoop. Hoops can't even throw a paper wad into a wastebasket from three feet away (a running gag used throughout the movie). At school, Hoops joins his best friend, George Calamari (Joel Murray), who persuades Hoops to spend two weeks partying on Nantucket Island. George stops to pick up his 10-year-old sister, Squid (Kristen Goelz), after school. She and her injured dog, Bosco, join George and Hoops for the trip to Nantucket after Squid shows that she does not tolerate any verbal abuse from others over her dog's ugly appearance. When two young girls make fun of Bosco and contort their faces, Squid slaps them on their backs and their faces stay that way. They both run off screaming.They stop for gas, and Hoops uses the restroom. A group of bikers led by Stain (John Matuszak) check the stalls looking for a woman named Cassandra (Demi Moore). As Stain demands his money, Hoops finds Cassandra's cash hidden in the towel dispenser, and throws the bills up in the air. He runs out, grabs Cassandra, and they jump into George's car. George speeds to the ferry, which is leaving the dock. George's car lands on the ferry deck, while the lead biker, Stain, falls into the bay (and getting little fish harpooned to his spiked pink-colored hairstyle).During the ferry ride, Cassandra informs them that she is visiting her grandfather, Mr. Eldridge, who lives on the island. When they arrive, she suggests they might meet again. George introduces Hoops to his friends, fraternal Stork twins Clay (Tom Villard) and Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait), two dim-witted local auto mechanics who are currently working as private security guards on a Hollywood film set for a movie titled 'Foam 2', a horror film about a dolphin with rabies menacing the community (a nod to the film series 'Jaws'). The group arrives at the home of George's grandparents. Grandma (Billie Bird) fusses over Squid while George's insane Uncle Frank (Bruce Wagner) has locked himself in a bedroom, listening obsessively to the local radio station, trying to win an on-air contest. The crotchety man tells his nephew and Hoops to scram.George and Hoops go to Target Beach, the local artillery range, and meet another friend, Ack Ack ""Acky"" Raymond (Curtis Armstrong), who collects mortar shells for his father, the gung-ho General Raymond (Joe Flaherty), the owner of the local guns and ammo store, who also heads up the local Scout troop. As they drive past a cemetery, Hoops notices Cassandra at her grandfather's funeral.Meanwhile, at the estate of the island's richest and most powerful family, the Beckersteds, Aguilla (Mark Metcalf) asks his spoiled son, Teddy (Matt Mulhern), if he is prepared to win this year's sailing regatta. Teddy has a new sailboat but the stakes are high. Old Man Beckersted (William Hickey), Teddy's wealthy grandfather, has vowed to disown Aguilla and Teddy if the young man does not win the trophy. Aguilla wants to use his father's resources to purchase the late Mr. Eldridge's property and build condominiums. However, his plan will be foiled if Cassandra raises $3,000 to pay Eldridge's back taxes.As Hoops walks with Cassandra on the beach, she explains her financial predicament. In addition, she worries that the friends her grandfather invited to live at the house will soon be homeless. Cassandra decides to sell some of her grandfather's furniture to raise money. Hoops draws cartoons to cheer her up (showing one of several animated sequences throughout the film of a ""Lonely Rhino"" searching for ""Love"" a blind cupid, while evading the evil and wealthy ""Fuzzy Bunnies"").A few days later on the beach, Hoops works at his drawings until George suggests that the Stork twins entertain his friend. As they chat, Teddy's girl friend, Cookie Cambell (Kimberly Foster), asks Hoops, Clay, and Egg to help her launch her boyfriend's sailboat. Hoops declines Cookie's offer to go sailing but agrees to her offer to take in a movie at the local drive-in theater that evening.Later that evening at nightfall, Hoops learns that Cassandra has raised some money selling her grandfather's furniture. Cassandra invites him to the Dew Drop Inn to hear her play guitar, where she hopes to raise more money. Hoops promises to be there, but has already made the movie date with Cookie. He tells his friends that he prefers to watch Cassandra perform, but Cookie shows up at the door, and he feels obligated to go to the movies with her. He asks the Storks to keep an eye on Teddy at his family's house in case he leaves to look for Cookie. On the film set of 'Foam 2', Egg takes over for his brother, watching the costume trailer and gets himself stuck in a Godzilla costume. When he realizes he has to be at the Beckerstead's party at 8:00 pm to watch Teddy, he is forced to go there in the costume. Back at the drive in theater, Cookie is bored, and suggests that they go to ""the Point"" and look at the moon.Elsewhere, Grandma takes Squid on a drive into town for dinner. While at a gas station, the two attendants make fun of Squid's dog, prompting Squid to roll up her car window and trap their neckties. Grandma drives off, dragging them down the road.At the Beckersted estate, Egg (still stuck in his Godzilla costume) hides in the bushes where a fundraiser is being held to raise money for the condo developments on the Elderidge property, and some Japanese investors are in attendance. At the drive-in theater, Hoops buys snacks, and Teddy's friend, Ty (Jeremy Piven), notices that Hoops is with Cookie. Ty telephones his friend and reports that Cookie is on a date with Hoops. The news sends Teddy into a jealous rage.When Old Man Beckersted throws a lit cigar away, it lands in Egg's Godzilla mouth. Egg goes crazy and crashes the party with smoke billowing out of his costume's mouth and stomps on the condo development models (resembling a Japanese monster movie of Godzilla stomping on city buildings) before running away into the night.At the Point, General Raymond delivers a rousing speech to his Boy Scout troop about how their overnight retreat is a perfect opportunity to practice their rescue skills. Just then, Hoops slips and falls, and the scouts descend and wrap him in bandages like a mummy. The scouts chase after Cookie, but she runs away and Teddy picks her up in his car, Cookie blaming Hoops and his friends for her terrified state. George rescues Hoops, and they drive to the Dew Drop Inn, but it is closed for it is after 11:00pm. Egg also arrives still dressed in his Godzilla costume as well as Acky and Clay, and they all help Egg out of the costume. When Teddy arrives with his friends and threatens to beat up Hoops, Cassandra steps in and challenges Teddy to compete against Hoops in a series of free-throw basketball shots (unaware that Hoops is terrible at basketball). Using Ack Ack as a makeshift ""basket"", Teddy makes every shot and Hoops misses every shot. Teddy is eager to rough up Hoops, but Cassandra sprays mace so that her new friends can escape. Hoops thanks her, and apologizes for missing her performance.A few days later, Hoops sees Cassandra at the beach, and offers to use his animation skills to help her fund raise. He creates an animated advertisement for Cassandra's performance, and shows it at the drive-in. He and his friends also hand out concert fliers in town. When Aguilla Beckersted realizes that Cassandra might raise enough money to save her grandfather's property, he enlists Teddy to prevent her from performing. Hoops and his friends fight back by pouring barrels of live lobsters into the Beckersted swimming pool. When Teddy goes for a swim with Cookie, the lobsters attack them both.Cassandra's concert is a success, but when she shows up to pay the tax bill, the meek banker explains that he already sold the mortgage to Old Man Beckersted. In revenge, Aguilla reveals more of his ruthlessness when he kicks and severely injures Squid's dog, who has to go to the animal hospital (staffed mostly by animals).Cassandra is ready to give up, but Acky suggests they enter and win the regatta by beating Teddy. The friends work to repair a shoddy boat, and Cassandra persuades Hoops to be captain. As they finish the boat, they realize they don't have a very powerful engine. Clay shows up with Teddy's Ferrari to have it serviced at their garage. Egg notices that Clay has a black eye given to him by Teddy. Egg becomes enraged, grabs a chainsaw and approaches Teddy's Ferrari...Race day arrives and most people laugh at Hoops' team and their boat, which looks silly next to the higher end sloops. The race begins with each team rowing out of the harbor. When they start to fall behind, George eggs Egg on with negative news about his favorite wrestling star and they begin to make up some distance. Teddy's team pulls way out in front when the rest of the boats hoist their sails for the next leg of the run.After a few miles, Aguilla Beckersted appears aboard Teddy's boat and sabotages Hoops' team by cutting their lanyard line with an arrow from a cross bow. Unable to thread the rope at the top of the mast, Hoops uses a small weight, and on a million-to-one shot, throws the small bearer ball through the hoop at the top (thus ending his curse at not being able to score any hoops). As Hoops, George, Acky, Clay and Egg sail on, Aguilla aims another arrow to put a hole in Hoops' craft, when the mechanical dolphin from 'Foam 2', powered by Squid, rams into the boat. Aguilla falls overboard where the mechanical dolphin ""eats"" him alive. The top hatch pops open and Squid cheerfully waves.In the last lap, the racers retract the sails and engage the boats' engines. Teddy leaves his father in the water and speeds toward the finish. Hoops' team all don anti-aircraft helmets and blow the boat's rear ""hatch"", revealing the engine from Teddy's Ferarri, installed by the Stork twins after Egg's rampage. Hoops and his friends speed to victory (giving 'the finger' to Teddy, Ty and the rest of his snobby friends). Afterward, Hoops offers Teddy the trophy in exchange for the Eldridge house. However, Old Man Beckersted, impressed with the novice team's effort, informs Cassandra that he is returning the Eldridge property to her and there will be no real estate development. Hoops and Cassandra celebrate and kiss for the first time. Also, Squid's dog is alive and returns to her... after giving birth to a litter of puppies at the animal hospital.In the final scene, George's uncle Frank finally wins the radio call-in contest for $1 million, but his phone gets disconnected before he can tell the DJ his name and his prize is given away to someone else; he snaps and promptly uses a rocket launcher to fire a guided missile to blow up the radio station. The Stork twins arrive in their tow truck and head to the fiery remains to roast marshmallows."

A group of eight college friends gather together at an island mansion belonging to heiress Muffy St. John to celebrate their final year of school. They soon discover that each has a hidden secret from their past which is revealed, and soon after, they turn up dead. Yet, are they really dead?

They include Kit (Amy Steel), and her boyfriend Rob (Ken Olandt), Nikki (Deborah Goodrich) and her boyfriend Chaz (Clayton Rohner), and Arch (Thomas F. Wilson) whom are best friends. The rest of the group includes Nan (Leah King Pinsent), Hal (Jay Baker), and Muffy's cousin Skip (Griffin ONeal). On the ferry, Skip and Arch play a game of 'stretch' (throwing a switchblade and both trying to stretch for it), until an irritated Arch throws the blade at Skip and hits him in the stomach. Skip falls off into the water in which the ferry crewman Buck (Mike Nomad) and Rob jump in only to see Skip with a trick knife-belt. Skip and Arch laugh at their April Fool's Day joke which happens to be that very day. Buck stays in the water and tries to hook the ferry as it comes into the dock, and as the group argues, Buck is hit by the ferry. He jumps out of the water with a chopped face. Buck is taken away by the ferryman (Lloyd Berry) in a motorboat screaming ""they did it!""

That evening, the group sits around the dinner table as Skip, still upset over what happened to Buck, stays outside and drinks. Muffy, with a smirk on her face, invites everyone for dinner as Nan sits on a whoopee cushion, and Arch leans back in a breakaway chair. They talk over what they will do after graduation in which Muffy tells them about her inheriting her father's house and talks about turning it into a country inn. They drink to a toast as Muffy's smirk gives away another gag she sets up as everyone spills champagne on themselves from the trick drippy glasses as Muffy laughs.They retire to their rooms for the night as they encounter more gags left behind my Muffy, which includes a trick cigar that blows up when Hal lights it; spurting water faucets, and trick lights that don't turn off. Hal finds snipped newspaper articles about people dying in a fog and a fire, which he apparently was involved in some years back. Arch finds a drug paraphernalia in his bathroom cabinet which he is disturbed by over his past as a junkie. Nikki finds a studded collar with a chain in which her reaction gives away her interest in S&M and bondage. Nan comes out of the shower when she hears a baby cry, and she finds a tape recorder playing in her drawer which makes her upset. Outside, a drunken Skip enters the boathouse near the dock when he is grabbed by someone.The next day, Kit and Rob find Muffy in the kitchen cooking breakfast with her hair astray and acting strange. The group enjoys hanging around the back yard, while Nan tries to chase down Muffy. Rob is still upset about his own discovery in his and Kit's bedroom where his counselor informed her that he was not serious enough to get into medical school. He and Kit go to the boathouse to kiss when Kit sees Skip float by and the two of them run to tell the others. Chaz finds Skip's broken and bloody trick switchblade, but no trace of Skip's body. Arch suggests that it is Buck who has returned to seek his revenge for his being maimed the previous day.Meanwhile, Nan catches up to Muffy and angrily tells her about finding the cassette-tape joke, and Muffy claims not to know what Nan is talking about. Nan tells Muffy that she had an abortion some years back and kept it quiet between them.In the woods, as Arch is running through to the house, he gets caught in a trap when he is hung upside down by a snare, while a snake is on the ground trying to bite him.

Rob tries to call the police on the house phone, but is unable to get through.When the water faucets in the house turn off, Hal and Nikki go to the nearby well.

Aware that there is a killer out there, the group goes around locking all the doors and windows of the house. In the study, Kit finds an old photograph of twins. Nikki says that Muffy has been acting strange all day and looks different from a pasty white face to her Catholic Girls School clothing as well as mentions the clodhopper ""nurse shoes"" that she also is wearing. Hal mentions that he heard Muffy and Nan arguing earlier about something in Nan's room, referencing an abortion that Nan was rumored to have gotten. They talk about the things found in their rooms when Muffy enters and says that she is going to bed. Chaz and Nikki go upstairs to their room as Rob heads up to the attic to keep an eye out for the constable. Kit goes off with Rob while Hal stays to watch the rooms downstairs.As Nikki packs her bags to leave, Chaz tries to calm her down by putting on a leather mask. Annoyed, Nikki pushes him to the bed and leaves the room. Nikki returns to see Chaz lying still on her bed. He does not respond to her and when she moves his hands away from his crotch, she sees blood. She is approached by someone standing behind the door.In the attic, Rob tells Kit that no one is to be left alone with Muffy for he does not trust her. They find a collection of dolls, apparently representing dead people, and a red flare goes off in the distance outside. They run out of the attic and call to everyone, but cannot find the others. The two enter Nikki and Chaz room only to find a bloody room, but no bodies. Kit runs into Muffy's room and finds Hal dead after being tied up and hung.In a panic, Kit and Rob run outside and to the dock where they pull in a motorboat, but no one is on board. They find a letter on the boat addressed to Constable Potter which talks of ""Miss St. John"", a dangerous mental patient who escaped several days ago from a clinic. Kit says it can't be Muffy for she was with her at Vassar all that time. They try to start up the boat to leave, but the keys are gone having been taken by Constable Potter who has gone off. Rob says that there are a spare set of keys to the boat in the house and the two of them return to find the house totally dark with all the doors and windows closed, and the shades pulled down. They enter through a cellar window where they see a bloody trail and find Muffy's clothes from the night before in the basement fireplace. Height measurements are found on one of the basement walls for 'Muffy' and 'Buffy'. Kit recalling the photo of the twins, says that it must be Muffy's twin sister, Buffy, who has been doing all the killing.Kit and Rob see eyes looking at them from behind a painting and, after pulling it away, discover Muffy's severed head. They run up to the kitchen to find the keys for the boat when Muffy/Buffy appears at the back door armed with a large breaking knife, trying to get inside. Buffy forces the door open and pushes Rob into a closet and locks it and goes after Kit, who runs into the dining room and tries to reason with the pasty-faced, wild-eyed Buffy who does not respond and terrorizes her with the breaking knife. Kit pushes Buffy back when she tries to stab her and runs into the adjacent living room to find all of the dead people, alive and well, sitting around the room. Buffy walks in and.... pushes the fake blade of the breaking knife into her hand as she everyone else looks up at Kit and yell... APRIL FOOLS!!!!!!Buck appears in the closet with Rob, pulls off his prosthetic injury, and slaps it on Rob's face and unlocks the closet door for him. Rob runs out and into the living room where everyone laughs some more. Kit and Rob are relived, but not amused at this giant practical joke on them. Muffy thanks all of them for participating and helping out. She tells everyone about her idea about making the house into a country inn, but having a special type of ""whodunit weekend"" where guests are to figure out a simulated mystery and she wanted a ""rehearsal"". Once a person was ""killed"" they were let in on the joke, with Rob and Kit being the last ones left and the winners who figured it all out. Muffy explains that her twin sibling is actually her cousin Skip, Constable Potter is actually her wealthy uncle, and Buck is a make-up artist who constructed all the severed heads and fake bodies. Even the ferryman was in on the whole thing as well. Muffy apologies for some of the more personal jokes, and the group drinks from dozens of bottles of champagne that Muffy brings out and they all have a happy good time.Later that night, a very inebriated Muffy returns to her bedroom for the night when she finds a package on her bed and upon opening it up finds a jack-in-the-box. As Muffy warily beings turning it to open, the jack jumps out when suddenly Nan jumps out behind the bed, grabs Muffy by the hair, gorily slices her throat, and Muffy screams. Nan smiles and shows Muffy the fake knife with the fake blood spraying from it, as a final back-at-you joke. ""April Fools"" says Nan to Muffy, as the jack-in-the-box winks at the viewers."
Labyrinth,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Sixteen-year-old Sarah must solve a labyrinth to rescue her baby brother when he is taken by the Goblin King. Sarah is forced by her father and her stepmother to babysit her baby stepbrother, Toby, while they are out. He does not stop crying and she wishes that he would be taken away. Out of the blue, he stops crying and when she looks for him in his crib, she learns that her wish was granted, and the Goblin King Jareth has taken him to his castle in the Goblin City in the middle of a labyrinth. Sarah repents and asks Jareth to give him back, but Jareth tells her that she has to rescue him before midnight. Soon she teams up with some allies. Will they rescue Toby in time?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Sarah, a petulant adolescent living in an alluring dream world of fantasy and enchantment, finds it hard to swallow that she must babysit her baby stepbrother, Toby. So, without a second thought, she wishes goblins would take the boy away in a fit of pique. But as all-hearing ears grant her horrible wish, Sarah has a change of heart. As a result, she embarks on a dangerous rescue mission to confront the fearful Goblin King Jareth in his impenetrable maze realm. However, sneaky creatures and an eerie mystique rule the ethereal realm. Can Sarah right a wrong and save Toby before she loses him forever in the tangled labyrinth?—Nick Riganas Sarah is left home alone by her father and stepmother, and she has to babysit her baby stepbrother, Toby. But he keeps crying and she, while reading him a story to make him sleep, inadvertently conjures the Goblin King Jareth from a fantasy world. He steals Toby and takes him to his castle in the middle of a labyrinth. Sarah has to rescue him before midnight.—Flavio Rizzardi <spillo@maya.dei.unpid.it> Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) was a teenager with a large imagination and love for fantasy stories, so much so that she enacted her favorite storybook, the Labyrinth, whenever she could. She happened to have been pretending that she was the heroine in her story while wandering in the park near her house when the clock on the near by city hall building struck, informing her it was 7pm. She realized she was an hour late and needed to get home to watch her baby stepbrother, Toby (Toby Froud). After arguing with her stepmother about her tardiness and feeling ignored by her father, Sarah was left alone with her fussy infant brother. Angered that her stepmother had given her brother one of her favorite teddy bears, a tattered toy called Lancelot, Sarah shouted into the air for someone to take her away from 'this awful place.' To get Toby to stop crying, she told him the story of how the Goblin King was in love with the girl who was 'forced to stay at home with the baby' and that he had 'given her certain powers.' But Sarah in no way believed this story could be real.In anger that the child wouldn't stop crying, Sarah did call for the goblins to take her brother. They took Toby away and Jareth (David Bowie), the King of the Goblins, gave her an option; she could take her dreams or spend 13 hours in his kingdom, an ever-changing maze called the Labyrinth. If she was able to get to the castle at the center within the specified time, her brother would be spared from becoming a goblin. Sarah was resolved to save her brother and the king left her to do her task.She immediately met an ancient looking dwarf with a feisty attitude who showed her how to enter the Labyrinth. His name was Hoggle (voiceBrian Henson) and he told her not to take anything for granted in that place; she didn't seem to find him very helpful and basically told him to leave. However, eventually she got herself stuck in an oubliette, and the one sent by the Goblin King to 'rescue' her was Hoggle.But Hoggle was beginning to like Sarah and against the orders he was given to send her back to the beginning of the Labyrinth, having her start all over again, and therefore be late, he made the choice to help her get to the center and reach her brother. This did not bode well with Jareth, who in umbrage at Sarah's haughty attitude took three hours of her time away and threatened to send Hoggle to the most horrible place known in the Labyrinth for his betrayal, a stinky land of slimy mud called the Bog of Eternal Stench. Then Jareth turned to Sarah and asked her how she was enjoying his Labyrinth. When she flippantly said it was a 'piece of cake,' the king sent a machine covered in spinning knives after her and Hoggle, then disappeared. They were able to escape, yet Hoggle got scared by the sound of a howling creature and said he was a friend to no one but himself, leaving Sarah to fend for herself.Sarah forced herself not to be afraid, remembering she had been told 'things aren't always what they seem in this place.' She found Ludo, a giant furry beast and a gentle creature despite his massive size, who became her friend when she saved him from being tortured by a bunch of goblins. But she became separated from Ludo too and found herself in a strange forest where she met the Firies, creatures that were able to dismember themselves and take off their heads. They tried to take off her head, which of course didn't work, but they didn't stop trying to mutilate her, so she threw their heads away. Hoggle came to her rescue, but she didn't know that the Goblin King had threatened that if she ever kissed him, he would immediately be sent to the Bog. As soon as her lips touched the dwarf's bald head in a kiss of gratitude for being rescued, the stones beneath them shook and they fell to the Bog. Thankfully they didn't fall into the muck. They found Ludo there and met Sir Didymus, a fox knight with a sheepdog as his steed, who decided to aid Sarah in her quest for her brother. As the castle was not much further, there was hardly anything left to prevent her from reaching Toby in time.Except one thing. The Goblin King had forced something on Hoggle; he was to give Sarah a peach that would make her forget about Toby. And Sarah was hungry, which left Hoggle no choice but to give the fruit to her. Handing it to her, he left in shame at having to obey the king.By eating the peach, Sarah found herself in a dream, in a ballroom full of masked faces. She wore a beautiful silver gown and the Goblin King held her tightly in a dance, but she knew there was something she had to do so she left his arms and broke free of the crystal ball he had placed her in.She awoke in a junkyard, peach in hand, but she still couldn't remember what she was supposed to be doing. A goblin woman with a collection of knickknacks on her back led her to a room: her bedroom. Sarah ran to her bed and flopped down onto it, burying her face in the pillow. It had all been just a terrible dream. But it wasn't a dream, for as soon as she opened her bedroom door, the goblin woman came in and tried to get her to begin a collection of knickknacks from her room for herself. One of the items happened to be her book of the Labyrinth and she was immediately reminded that she needed to save Toby. Her friends had followed her to the junkyard when she had been trapped in the crystal and pulled her to safety. They quickly hurried to the nearby castle, for she had less than an hour left.They entered the Goblin City, which surrounded the castle, and soon found goblins attacking them in hordes. But eventually they made it through the chaos to the castle. The throne room was empty and a clock on the wall let Sarah know she had less than 5 minutes left to reach her brother. The only direction Jareth could have taken Toby was up the stairs, and Sarah went it alone, to the concern of her friends.When she reached the room at the top she had to hold to the wall to keep from getting dizzy. This room had many stairways that led to nowhere and walkways between. There was no up or down and she didn't know which way to go. But the Goblin King made himself known, standing below her and she gasped when she saw him. He easily walked around the ledge to her, even walked straight through her, trying to intimidate her. With an evil grin he threw a crystal and she watched as it bounced across the multiple perspectives of the room, only to land in the hands of her brother, who seemed to be sitting upside down above her. Now that she knew where Toby was, all she had to do was get to him, but that was the whole problem. Toby would crawl somewhere different the second she thought she had neared him and, unlike her, he didn't know he wasn't supposed to be able to defy gravity and crawl on the ceiling. Finally she found him directly below her, sitting on the floor, dangling his feet over the ledge of a door. Toby was right there, twenty feet below her, and she had no way of getting to him. Sarah didn't know how long this had been taking her but knew she hardly had any time left. All that she knew was that if she didn't hold Toby in her arms in time, he would never be the same again; she had to save him from becoming a goblin. So with a gulp and wincing of her face at the thought of how broken her bones would be once she fell to the ground beside him, she jumped.But she didn't hit the floor. In fact, as she kept falling, the room was breaking up around her. Finally her feet hit a floor and she found the Goblin King slowly walking towards her from out of the shadows. He wore all white, his cape of feathers flowing about him as he neared her. She began to state the lines her story said would defeat him and finalize her brother's safety, but the king stopped her and offered her dreams to her once again; he even offered himself. But her only resolve was to save Toby, so she completed her dialog and found herself back in her home. The defeated Goblin King flew out the window, banished to live in an owl form.Sarah ran upstairs to ensure that her brother had been returned and found Toby sleeping soundly. She went to her room and began to put away those things that were part of her childhood fantasies, but as she did so, she saw the faces of her friends from the Labyrinth staring at her in her mirror. They told her they would always be around if she needed them, and she told them that every now and again in her life, she would."

Under the Cherry Moon,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092133/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two con artist brothers attempt to swindle a soon-to-be wealthy heiress, but things get complicated when one falls in love with her. Two cousins from Miami, Florida are in the Mediterranean, enjoying life by scamming money off of rich women. One day, they read about a young woman, Mary Sharon (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), set to inherit fifty million dollars from her father. At first, Tricky (Jerome Benton) has Christopher Tracy (Prince) talked into romancing her for her money, but as he gets to know her, Christopher falls in love with her. This love comes between the cousins, and Tricky tells all about the plan.—Jathanis <jlevers@ainet.com> At the Venus de Milo nightclub in Nice on the French Riviera, gigolo Christopher Tracy (Prince) raises a glass for a toast and plays piano for the patrons. A voiceover says he lived for money, entertaining rich women of all types, but died for just one woman after learning the true meaning of love. As he plays, a mysterious woman in white appears and sits at a specially placed chair to listen to him play. At a nearby table sits his partner Tricky (Jerome Benton), who has a server pass Christopher napkins with notes on how to win her over, and reminders that they need money. With suggestive eye contact and body language they silently size each other up until she sends over a drink for him and leaves a sizeable wad of money on the table as she leaves, confirming their assignation for the evening.The following morning Christopher has discreetly left a note on the pillow of the woman in white and gone to a private hillside grotto where he keeps a piano and writes poetry and music. Back in Nice, he doles out money to some passing kids and helps a woman select flowers in the market before returning to his apartment. Tricky is making out with the landlady, Katy (Emmanuelle Sallet), who is demanding payment on two months of back rent under threat of turning them out on the streets. After joking and stalling, Christopher gives up a wallet full of money as he heads to their room for a bath. He tells Tricky that Mrs. Wellington (Francesca Annis), the woman in white, is divorced and worth three million dollars. The goal of getting rich through marriage is part of their profession of fleecing people, but Christopher wants a bigger payload. Tricky points out a newspaper headline that Mary Sharon (Kristin Scott Thomas), daughter of a billionaire shipping magnate, has just turned 21 and will receive a trust fund worth $50 million dollars. Christopher says he would consider marrying her for that amount of money. Mrs. Wellington calls and asks Christopher for some seductive poetry on the phone, so he slips into the bathtub and woos her, then laughs with Tricky after they hang up.At the party for Mary Sharon, her father Isaac (Steven Berkoff) has pulled out all the stops, with circus animals and fire breathers, and a guest list of the richest folks on the Gold Coast, but he is absent from the event. A band of observers known as the Jaded Three (Victor Spinetti, Myriam Tadesse, Moune De Vivier) follow the circus parade through the grounds as they gossip about Isaac. Muriel Sharon (Alexandra Stewart) is waiting with the others for Mary, who suddenly shows up in nothing but a sheet, opens it for the assembled guests and asks if they like her birthday suit. She then takes over the drum kit, and the band joins her in an impromptu performance. She sees Christopher, who turns on the charm, but she is not impressed and goes to change into a gown for her party, asking her three friends (Pamela Ludwig, Barbara Stall, Karen Geerlings) to watch over the two party crashers.When she returns her friends fill her in on Christopher, saying he made the rounds twice to check out all the women, and Tricky is also at work. Mrs. Wellington gives Mary a present. Tricky introduces himself and she blows him off as she heads to the fountain away from the crowd. She tosses the present behind her shoulder and Christopher catches it. She tries to put him off with rude retorts as he opens the box for her and finds a deck of tarot cards. When Mary realizes the appearance of Mrs. Wellington has set him on edge, she takes him over to introduce him to Muriel, who is talking with her. Muriel asks if he reads cards professionally, and he replies that he only does things for fun.Tricky gets Mary to join his conga line with the other partygoers, but her friends pull her away to take a phone call from her fiancée Jonathan, who is in New York. After she puts his off-key birthday song on the speaker phone, she sees Christopher is in the room. They exchange insulting banter, and Jonathan overhears it, thinking she is talking to him. Annoyed, she ultimately hangs up on him. Christopher gives her a free pass to the Venus de Milo, but as he rejoins Tricky she orders the bouncers to throw them out. Mrs. Wellington is leaving the party so Christopher joins her. At her home the answering machine picks up a live call from Isaac, who says he will be back home in the morning, giving her and Christopher another night of fun. He plays piano during the message and misses that Isaac said he plans to visit at 7:00 the next night.In the morning Mary has come up with a retort for a remark Christopher aimed at her before being ejected from the party, finally heads to the club and interrupts his playing to deliver it. He asks if she had worked all night to come up with the line. Chastened, she tells him Mrs. Wellington passed her word that she wants Christopher at her house at 7:00 that evening.Tricky dances with Mary and treats her with politeness and respect, making her feel more comfortable. He says he wants a special woman to add new perspective in his life. She invites them to another venue called Le Pavilion to see if they blend into the finer side of life. Christopher cuts in and takes her onto the terrace. They dance and continue to exchange insults until it wears thin and they ask what each wants from the other. Christopher tries to entice her, but has to leave or he will be late to his date with Mrs. Wellington. Pulling up at her home with champagne and glasses, he sees an impressive car parked there. Sitting in the driver seat, he finds the license and sees the car belongs to Isaac. Realizing Mary is using him to get at her father and his own affair with Mrs. Wellington, he yells taunts at the house and pulls away, leaving the champagne behind as the two rush out in disheveled clothes.As the pair dress for the evening, Christopher says Mary knows who she is but not what she wants, and Tricky thinks she will want to marry him instead. She is not accustomed to their way of life, however, and they mull over how to show it to her. At home Mary says she wants to joyride in the boat, and her father objects. She is testing her independence and they argue over the trust, which Isaac has modified to include the condition that Mary wed Jonathan. Christopher teases Tricky, saying Isaac and Muriel would not approve of their union and the police would arrest him, while he would sit by and deny he knows him. They stare each other down and Tricky breaks eye contact first, making Christopher laugh.At the venue Tricky insists Mary likes him better and will dance to his tune, and Christopher gets an idea to bring her down to their world. Inside the restaurant Christopher taunts Mary that she is not familiar with the kind of life in their native Miami. He writes down the words ""wrecka stow"" on a napkin. They prod her to repeat the words loudly, but she cannot fathom the phrase. He and Tricky laugh raucously, and their behavior disturbs the patrons. Christopher finally asks Mary where one would go to buy a Sam Cooke album, and she realizes she is looking at a phonetic urban pronunciation for a record store.The staff clear a space on the floor for dancing, and Tricky hauls a huge boom box to the stage to play their own music, which the patrons gamely dance to. The maître d' has phoned Isaac, who shows up with his bodyguard Lou (Guy Cuevas) and his retinue. They break the boom box and put an end to the evening. Mary says she wanted to do something special for once, but when he says they are going home, she obediently follows him out. Isaac asks Lou to get information about Christopher and Tricky.At the apartment, Tricky confesses that he likes Mary, but Christopher tells him to just keep handling the money in the partnership. Mary calls Christopher, unable to get to sleep, and vaguely suggests that she wants him, so he and Tricky proceed to the house and set up a ladder to a second floor balcony so Christopher can seduce her. He tells Tricky to whistle four times if they need to abort the mission, then enters the bedroom pretending to be a pizza delivery man. He whispers that he will take care of everything, and she replies in a strange voice that she takes medication to sleep. Outside, Tricky spots Mary, whose bedroom is actually on the third floor. He smiles and is about to leave his partner in the predicament when he spots men patrolling the grounds. Unable to whistle through a dry mouth, Tricky climbs the ladder and pitches stones at Christopher to distract him and tell him he is actually with Muriel, and they manage to escape. Isaac comes to bed, and a now seductive Muriel, warmed up by Christopher, takes control of her own satisfaction.The next day Mary visits the two at their apartment and shows them a consolation gift of money from her father for missing her birthday party. They go on a shopping spree. Christopher buys a car from the Jaded Three to give to Mary, while she and Tricky buy pricey clothes and watches. Christopher whispers to her to meet him at the hippodrome after sunset before she goes off for more shopping with Tricky.Later Christopher tells Tricky he wants to leave the business and become an honest man. At a small café they discuss the power of love, and Christopher feels that two people who truly loved each other could never be separated. Tricky tries to stress that they are engaged in business and need to get enough money to return to Miami before Isaac gets them. They do not see Lou watching them, and the place clears out quickly when Tricky sees bats on the ceiling. Later they dress for the evening, and Christopher says he will meet Tricky at the club in two hours, as he must do something before picking up Mary. He waits at the hippodrome for Mary, who drives up in her new car. They race, finally kiss and spend the evening together, and a furious Tricky leaves the club when he realizes he has been stood up.In the car after they share a laugh, Christopher asks Mary why Isaac is so cruel. Still programmed by the class structure she has been raised on, she says he is considered a peasant. He makes remarks about their relationship compared to how she would act with Jonathan, she gets angry and tells him to shut up. He pretends to be indignant and says he is calling her father. He calls Mrs. Wellington from a nearby phone booth, knowing Isaac is there, and pretends to be Lou to speak with him. When he answers the phone, Christopher taunts Isaac by saying that he loves Mary and she will come around to loving him, threatening to tell Muriel if Isaac attempts to separate them. Mary cuts the call short and tells Christopher that her father has the chief of police in his pocket, but he says he can destroy Isaac, and they make out in the booth while Lou, in a concealed car nearby, keeps a watch on them.The next morning Isaac yells at Mary when she finally arrives at home after being out all night. She ignores him until he grabs her arm and rants about how her marriage to Jonathan will increase the net worth for both families, and she realizes he is pawning her off to Jonathan in his greed for more money. At the apartment, Christopher comes home to a drunken Tricky, who yells at him for breaking all the rules they made in their partnership. Tricky says Christopher is jealous because he can steal Mary, and insults him. Christopher leaves to find Mary waiting at the front door for him, hoping they can get away for a while. He takes her in a small motorboat to the grotto, where they make love. Isaac calls Sam (Sam Karmann) to help him deal with the problem.As they drive back to the club, Mary points out to Christopher that a limo sent by her father is following them. Tricky comes out of the bar, where Katy has been trying to smooth things over and curb his drinking, but Tricky brings up the first conversation Christopher had with him, in which he said he would consider marrying Mary for $50 million dollars. Feeling she has been used all along, Mary leaves in the limo. At home Mary confronts Muriel, saying she is hurt by the hypocrisy on which they raised her. Muriel tells her daughter she feels hurt as well. Mary wants to leave for New York immediately.Christopher has entered the club and downed several drinks. An older woman, a former client, accosts him, saying she misses him. Realizing his lifestyle has gotten him nowhere, he runs off and winds up at Mrs. Wellingtons home. She hands him a check from Isaac for $100 thousand dollars to keep him away from Mary, but he writes a classic obscenity on it, hands it back and is ready to leave when she tells him Mary is leaving at midnight on the family plane for New York. As he pulls off, she wishes him good luck.At the airport, Christopher pleads with Mary for five minutes so he can talk to her, determined to seal their love for each other. He drives away with her and parks the car so they can talk in private, while Isaac arrives at the airport and insists that Mary was abducted against her will. Mary says she does not know him anymore, so Christopher gets into the back seat and puts on dark sunglasses, saying nothing while she unloads her frustrations on him, at one point calling him a whore, which visibly affects him. When she says she hates him, he replies he loves her, and after some give and take, she realizes she does love him, and as they kiss he offers a chance to go away together forever.Tricky returns to the apartment, rehearsing his speech to Christopher so they can mend their partnership, but finds Lou and the others there. They rough him up when he refuses to reveal where Christopher is, and knock him out. Isaac receives a call that investigators found the car Christopher drives parked at the harbor. Mary awakens in the grotto to find a poem Christopher has written about being an honest man, noting that, even in death, they would always be together. At the apartment Isaac calls Lou to send the men to the harbor, and Tricky comes to in time to escape with Katy.Christopher meets up with Tricky at the harbor, and Tricky promises to be the best man if the wedding comes off. He and Katy deal with Lou and the men as they close in. Isaac arrives with the harbor patrol on the water, and Christopher heads out in the motorboat to get Mary. She races down from the grotto when she hears the commotion, and a marksman on the boat is told to shoot Christopher. Mary pleads with him to run away, but he gets off the boat onto the dock, saying he will not go without her, and a shot is fired. As a distraught Tricky falls to his knees in prayer, Mary goes to the dock and cradles Christopher, who smiles and dies in her arms. When Isaac arrives to take Mary home, she says she is going with Christopher and accompanies the patrol boat, leaving Isaac alone on the dock.Time passes, and Tricky has returned to Miami in style, driving a Rolls Royce. He has become an apartment manager. Katy brings a letter that has arrived from Mary, who is now his investor. She has stayed single, and notes Christopher was right. She will come to Miami soon to visit, and says for Tricky to give Katy a hug for her. She is ready for her hug, but the tables have turned and a smiling Tricky reminds his tenant that her rent is late and he will throw her out onto the Miami streets. Though Christopher is gone, life will go on for his friends."

SpaceCamp,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091993/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The young attendees of a space camp find themselves in space for real when their shuttle is accidentally launched into orbit. American kids go to a space camp during the summer holidays. They learn how to operate the Space Shuttle. A team consisting of a guy who just entered to meet girls, a wanna be astronaut and an instructor who wanted to go on a mission instead of teaching can sit in the Shuttle while testing the engines. Then they're launched by mistake ...—Ivo Kroone <ab2693@triton.heao.hsa.nl> On February 20, 1963, a young girl named Andie (Hollye Rebecca Suggs) is laying out under the stars somewhere in the rural farmlands of America, trying to see if she can spot Friendship 7 during its return to Earth after its historic orbital mission. She noticed what looks like a shooting star, which blinks in the sky. Taking this as John Glenn winking at her, Andie promises herself that, one day, she too will become an astronaut.23 years later, Andie Bergstrom (Kate Capshaw) flies a T-38 Talon into John F. Kennedy Space Center and meets her husband, fellow astronaut and former moonwalker Zack Bergstrom (Tom Skeritt) on the tarmac. She is now in NASA's astronaut program, but has not flown into space yet. In fact, she's upset that she was passed up for a coming mission. Zack immediately cashes in on a promise she made if she didn't get the flight: he recruits her as an instructor for that summer's Space Camp program.As registration begins, among the arrivals for the program is Kevin Donaldson (Tate Donovan), driving his new Jeep. Initially he rubs Zack the wrong way by parking in his spot. After he moves his Jeep, he notices the young female pilot of a biplane flying in: Kathryn Fairly (Lea Thompson). Immediately smitten, he catches up behind her in the registration line. Wanting to get closer to her, he steals somebody else's credentials so he can end up in the Blue Team, the same team as her.As it so happens, the Blue Team is the one being instructed by Andie Bergstrom, whom Kathryn idolizes as one of the few female pilots in the shuttle program. She realises that Donaldson is not on her list of students, but as Hideo Takamini (Scott Holcomb) isn't around, she just lets things be. In addition to Kathryn and Kevin, three others make up the team. Tish Ambrosei (Kelly Preston) has the look of a valley girl, but is highly intelligent, with a photographic memory and a perfect SAT score. Rudy Tyler (Larry B. Scott) is a young African American man from a military family; he loves science, but isn't very good at it. Last, there's Max Graham (Joaquin Phoenix), a kid with a Star Wars obsession that is still young enough for the junior program. Andie permits Max on the team since he's been in the junior program for the past two years.Andie gives shuttle positions to each of the cadets. To everyone's surprise, the seemingly irresponsible Kevin is made Shuttle Commander, while Kathryn, who aspires to be a real Commander one day, is named the Pilot. The others are Mission Specialists. Tish is responsible for communications, while Rudy is responsible for operations. Max is not given a specific area of responsibility.During the initial tour, the Blue Team is introduced to a ""prototype maintenance droid"", a robot called ""Jinx"" (Frank Welker's voice). He was intended for use on a future space station, but too many bugs in his AI programming relegated him to service work around the Cape. Max hides Jinx in his closet. One night, Jinx is teased by other members of the Space Camp, particularly the Green Team, who ask him to do twenty things at the same time, resulting in frying his circuitry. Max spends the night repairing Jinx, and the two become, as Jinx says, ""friends forever"".For the Blue Team, Space Camp is anything but smooth sailing. Although they develop a camraderie together, they have difficulties working together as a team, largely the result of Kevin not taking his position as Commander seriously. Kathryn, in addition, is frustrated by her inability to master the multi-axis trainer, a prerequisite for any real shuttle pilot.Kevin succeeds in bonding with Kathryn, and gets directions from Jinx to a good place to see the Space Shuttle, Atlantis, on the pad so he can sneak out with her. Unfortunately, Jinx readily rats them out to Zack when they turn up missing. Kevin blames Max for Jinx's betrayal, leading Max to wish aloud, while wandering the camp alone, that he were in space. Overhearing him, Jinx takes it literally and works with other NASA computers to figure out a way to get Max into space. Meanwhile, Andie and Kathryn had the opportunity of having a chat together: Andie complais that Kathryn is much more tougher on her than on the rest, and Kathryn reminds her that she will only be able to command a shuttle if she is best than all the others.Tensions in the Blue Team come to a head when they end up screwing up in a simulation. The Green Team arranges for the electric power to create a circuit malfunction. Kevin didn't take the situation seriously, Tish and Rudy argued about what do; Kathryn left her place as pilot to go and argue some more with Rudy and Tish. All this happening while Max is left outside on the outer arm, being jarred repeatedly and getting dizzy. All this led to disaster: if there had been a real-life situation, they all would have died. While Kevin doesn't think it's a big deal, Andie has to lecture him on responsibility.The Blue Team earns a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: they will sit in Atlantis during a test firing of its main engines. This gives Jinx his chance. During the test, Jinx orders a computer to send a code to Launch Control: a ""thermal curtain failure"" in one of the solid rocket boosters. Unlike the main engines, which can be turned off, the solid rockets cannot be stopped once lit, essentially requiring Atlantis to be launched. Atlantis, with the Blue Team on-board, successfully reaches orbit. However, they have two problems, both caused by the fact that Atlantis was not yet equipped for an actual launch. It does not have its normal communications equipment installed, and it only carries 12 hours worth of oxygen. They do not have enough oxygen to get to the next available window, or opportunity, to safely land at Edwards Air Force Base, the normal Shuttle Landing facility.Unable to communicate directly, with only telemetry relaying between the ground and Atlantis, Launch Control director (Terry O'Quinn) and the Blue Team both think of how to get more oxygen and get home. Andie remembers something: Space Station Daedalus, under construction but already carrying extra oxygen canisters. They could recharge their own oxygen tanks there. During the transit to Daedalus, Tish begins to use one of the telemetry switches, the ""CXT switch"", to attempt to reach Launch Control via Morse code. When they reach Daedalus, Andie begins a dangerous solo spacewalk to get an oxygen tank from the space station. However, she is too big to reach any of the tanks through the station's truss structure. Max agrees to go out, in a suit scrunched down to his smaller size by one of Tish's belts, and he successfully grabs two tanks; one for a backup. Before they get back to Atlantis, Max accidentally ends up hurtling away from the space station, but Andie uses her manned manuevering unit to catch up to him and bring him back safely.During the misadventure, Atlantis runs out of oxygen reserves, leaving those inside with just the air in the cabin. When Andie goes to fill the tanks, there is a problem. She cannot decide which of the four tanks needs to be filled first. Rudy and Kathryn each have a different choice. There are four valves: from left to right, a single-headed blue valve, a red valve, a yellow valve and a double-headed blue valve. They must be filled in the proper sequence. Rudy thinks it's the blue valve next to the yellow, while Kathryn thinks it's the blue valve next to the red. Rudy tells Andie to go for the one next to the yellow valve. It works. The tank is emptied completely into Atlantis, buying them 12 extra hours on orbit if necessary. Finding out that Atlantis has more oxygen via telemetry, Launch Control puts the shuttle on auto, so it will take the next available window to landing.However, Andie connects the second tank to the second head on the double-headed blue valve instead of going to the yellow valve, and blows the tank off of the connection, sending her hurtling into the back of the payload bay. Andie is left unconscious, seriously injured, and floating slowly out to space. Max tries to pull her in by her lifeline, but the payload bay doors close, pinning Andie outside of Atlantis. Kevin makes a choice: he overrides the auto landing, missing the window for Edwards AFB, and reopens the payload bay doors, bringing Andie back inside Atlantis. The Blue Team immediately explores other options to get home, as they again do not have enough oxygen to get to the next window for Edwards AFB, and don't have enough air left in the space suits to return for more oxygen at Daedalus.They begin to explore other places to land, and figure something out: White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, where Columbia had to land at the end of STS-3. Just as they begin their preparations, Jinx, who has discovered Tish's Morse code, reaches Launch Control and brings the contact to Zack's attention. NASA finally acknowledges the Blue Team, and quickly learns the full situation.Andie wakes up, but is still hurt badly, and it's up to Kevin, Kathryn, Tish, Rudy and Max to land Atlantis. Kathryn takes the role of pilot, just as in Space Camp. It's then that her worst fear comes to pass: Atlantis enters a flat spin after its deorbit burn, exactly the situation that the multi-axis trainer simulates. Kathryn manages to regain control of Atlantis. After a tough manual reentry, Atlantis makes it safely to a landing at White Sands."

Jack needs Graham to help him to trace the profile of the ""Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan) serial killer that attacks in the full moon and has killed Mrs. Jacobi (Kristin Holby) in Birmingham, Alabama, and Valerie Leeds (Elisabeth Ryall) in Atlanta, Georgia, and their families. Graham speaks with Molly and accepts the assignment, and he immediately visits the crime scenes and the dangerous Dr. Lecktor in prison to seek help to find the motives. Then Graham asks Jack to send his efficient agent Jimmy Price (Dan Butler) to Atlanta to seek fingerprints on the bodies of the members of the Leeds family. Soon they learn that the ""Tooth Fairy"" has contacted Dr. Lecktor, who gave Graham's address to the serial killer. Will Graham succeed in stopping the killer before the next full moon?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Will Graham (William Petersen), an ex-F.B.I. profiler, quit the job because of the toil his last case, that of serial killer, psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox), took on him. Despite his work directly leading to Lecktor being captured and incarcerated, working on the case not only almost took Will's life, but also his sanity, as he needed to get into psychopathic Lecktor's mind. Will is coerced by his old boss, Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), to return to work to assist with a new case of a serial murderer coined by the media as the ""Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan). The Tooth Fairy has thus far committed two sets of murders, in consecutive months on the night of the full moon. Both sets of murders, occurring in different cities, were of families in their own houses, the family matriarch in each case was the person the Tooth Fairy seemed to place special attention. Will agrees to the job in part because he too is a family man, he assuring his loving wife Molly Graham (Kim Greist) that he will only examine the evidence and not get immersed psychologically into the case like he did last time. Will can't help but consult Lecktor on the case in needing once again to understand the mind of a psychopathic serial killer. Adding to the complexity of the case is Freddy Lounds (Stephen Lang), a reporter with a national tabloid, he who not only sensationalized the Lecktor case, but also capitalized on Will's mental decline during that case. Lounds cannot help but once again try to find something salacious on which to write with Will's involvement in the ""Tooth Fairy"" case. The case may end up being personal against the other for Will and the ""Tooth Fairy"", especially as Will discovers some ties, either direct or indirect, back to Lecktor. What neither Will nor the ""Tooth Fairy"" probably imagined is the entrance of an unexpected person into their lives that may affect what happens. All this becomes more and more important as the next full moon approaches.—Huggo Emotionally scarred but still alive after his close encounter with the charismatic but deranged criminal mastermind, Dr Hannibal Lecktor, the now-retired F.B.I. Agent, Will Graham, is reluctantly back in action. As the psychopathic serial killer known as the ""Tooth Fairy"" is still on the loose, taking great pleasure in decimating entire families, Graham must face his inner demons and Lecktor, his manipulative arch-enemy, to better understand the insane mind of the methodical murderer. Once more, time is against Graham, who will have to go to great lengths to crack this thorny case. Can he find who the Tooth Fairy is before the next full moon?—Nick Riganas Will Graham (William Petersen) is a former FBI criminal profiler who has retired because of a breakdown after being attacked by a cannibalistic serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox). Graham is approached at his Florida home by his former FBI superior Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), who is seeking help with a new serial killer case. Promising his wife (Kim Greist) that he will do nothing more than examine evidence and not risk physical harm, Graham agrees to visit the most recent crime scene in Atlanta, where he tries to enter the mindset of the killer, now dubbed the ""Tooth Fairy"" by the police for the bite-marks left on his victims.Having found the killer's fingerprints, Graham meets with Crawford. They are accosted by tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds (Stephen Lang), with whom Graham has a bitter history. Lounds' paper had run photographs of Graham taken secretly while he was hospitalized. Graham pays a visit to Lecktor, a former psychiatrist, in his cell and asks for his insight into the killer's motivations. After a tense conversation, Lecktor agrees to look at the case file. Lecktor later contrives to obtain Graham's home address by deceit.Graham travels to the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama, where he is contacted by Crawford, who tells him of Lounds' tabloid story on the case. Crawford also patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton (Benjamin Hendrickson), Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize it is from the Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor has removed. It is found to be an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper.The FBI intended to plant a fake advertisement to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake. So they let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which he gives a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims and slides of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the  National Tattler  as a warning.Graham is told by Crawford that they have cracked Lecktor's coded message to the Tooth Fairy: it is Graham's home address with an instruction to kill the family (ending with ""Save yourself. Kill them all,"" revealing that Lecktor believes Graham would find the Tooth Fairy). Graham rushes home to find his family safe but terrified. After the FBI moves Graham's family to a safehouse, he tries to explain to his son Kevin why he had retired previously, and he does so at a supermarket, of all places. At his job in a St. Louis film lab, Francis Dollarhyde (the Tooth Fairy) approaches a blind co-worker, Reba McClane (Joan Allen), and ends up offering her a lift. They go to Dollarhyde's home, where Reba is oblivious to the fact that Dollarhyde is watching home-movie footage of his planned next victim. She kisses him and they make love. Dollarhyde is confused by this newfound relationship, though it helps suppress his bloodlust. Just as Graham comes to realize how much the Tooth Fairy's desire for acceptance factors into the murders, Dollarhyde watches as Reba is escorted home by another co-worker. Mistakenly believing them to be kissing, Dollarhyde murders the man and abducts Reba. When she calls him Francis, he tells her: ""Francis is gone. Forever.""Desperately trying to figure out a connection between the murdered families, Graham realizes that someone must have seen their home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there immediately. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. Graham determines which employee has seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. At Dollarhyde's home Reba is terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. As he struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone inside with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is quickly subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it to wound Crawford and kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen to shoot Graham, but misses because of his injuries and is killed himself when Graham returns fire. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently."
Blue Velvet,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090756/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The discovery of a severed human ear found in a field leads a young man on an investigation related to a beautiful, mysterious nightclub singer and a group of psychopathic criminals who have kidnapped her child. College student Jeffrey Beaumont returns to his idyllic hometown of Lumberton to manage his father's hardware store while his father is hospitalized. Walking though a grassy meadow near the family home, Jeffrey finds a severed human ear. After an initial investigation, lead police Detective John Williams advises Jeffrey not to speak to anyone about the case as they investigate further. Detective Williams also tells Jeffrey that he cannot divulge any information about what the police know. Detective Williams' high school aged daughter, Sandy Williams, tells Jeffrey what she knows about the case from overhearing her father's private conversations on the matter: that it has to do with a nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens, who lives in an older apartment building near the Beaumont home. His curiosity getting the better of him, Jeffrey, with Sandy's help, decides to find out more about the woman at the center of the case by breaking into Dorothy's apartment while he knows she's at work. What Jeffrey finds is a world unfamiliar to him, one that he doesn't truly understand but one that he is unable to deny the lure of despite the inherent dangers of being associated with a possible murder. Still, he is torn between this world and the prospect of a relationship with Sandy, the two who are falling for each other, despite Sandy already being in a relationship with Mike, the school's star football player.—Huggo There is something strange going on in the picture-perfect suburban community of Lumberton, North Carolina, as the grotesque discovery of a severed human ear crawling with ants begins to haunt the inquisitive college student, Jeffrey Beaumont. However, where is the rest of the body? Above all, who could be the owner of the hair-raising finding? Unable to answer these troubling questions, and with the local police officer, Detective John Williams, unwilling to disclose vital evidence, obsessed Jeffrey embarks on a thrilling but equally dangerous mission to unearth the truth, along with Williams' pretty daughter, Sandy. And now, more and more, the pair becomes embroiled in the gloomy, ill-lit world of the troubled nightclub singer with the velvety voice, Dorothy Vallens, and her psychotic, gas-huffing, drug-dealing beau, Frank Booth. Are the unsuspecting amateur investigators prepared to confront the hidden realm of depravity and murder behind the mystery of the chopped-off ear?—Nick Riganas Google-Übersetzung v. Huggo Der College-Student Jeffrey Beaumont kehrt in seine idyllische Heimatstadt Lumberton zurück, um den Baumarkt seines Vaters zu leiten, während sein Vater ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert wird. Bei einem Spaziergang durch eine grasbewachsene Wiese in der Nähe des Familienhauses findet Jeffrey ein abgetrenntes menschliches Ohr. Nach einer ersten Untersuchung rät der leitende Polizeidetektiv John Williams Jeffrey, mit niemandem über den Fall zu sprechen, während sie weiter untersuchen. Detective Williams sagt Jeffrey auch, dass er keine Informationen darüber preisgeben kann, was die Polizei weiß. Detective Williams' Tochter im Highschool-alter, Sandy Williams, erzählt Jeffrey, was sie über den Fall weiß, wenn sie die privaten Gespräche ihres Vaters zu diesem Thema gehört hat: dass es mit einer Nachtclub-Sängerin namens Dorothy Vallens zu tun hat, die in einem älteren Mehrfamilienhaus in der Nähe des Beaumont-Hauses lebt. Jeffrey, seine Neugier, ihn zu überwältigen, beschließt mit Sandys Hilfe, mehr über die Frau im Zentrum des Falls herauszufinden, indem er in Dorothys Wohnung einbricht, während er weiß, dass sie bei der Arbeit ist. Was Jeffrey findet, ist eine Welt, die ihm nicht vertraut ist, eine, die er nicht wirklich versteht, aber eine, der er trotz der inhärenten Gefahren, mit einem möglichen Mord in Verbindung gebracht zu werden, nicht in der Lage ist, die Verlockung zu leugnen. Dennoch ist er hin- und hergerissen zwischen dieser Welt und der Aussicht auf eine Beziehung mit Sandy, den beiden, die sich ineinander verlieben, obwohl Sandy bereits in einer Beziehung mit Mike, dem Starfußballspieler der Schule, ist. A college student (MacLachlan) stumbles across a bizarre mystery after discovering a severed ear and wants to know more, perhaps too much more. The strange world he's found lurking beneath his hometown's picture-postcard veneer is about to become much stranger. In the small logging town of Lumberton, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) returns home from college after his father (Jack Harvey) suffers a near fatal stroke. He stays with his mother (Priscilla Pointer) and Aunt Barbara (Frances Bay) while he takes over working at the local hardware store that his father owns. While walking home from the hospital one day after visiting his father, he cuts through a vacant lot where he discovers a severed ear buried under overgrown grass and puts it in a paper bag. Jeffrey takes the ear to the police station and speaks to Detective John Williams (George Dickerson) whom he knows as a neighbor.Later that evening, Jeffrey goes to Williams' house to glean further details. He finds the detective evasive about the case and receives a stern warning from Williams not to talk about what he found to anyone because it might jeopardize an ongoing police investigation. Outside the house, Jeffrey meets the detective's daughter, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern). She tells him a name she overheard from her father of a woman being investigated, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), a singer who also lives in the neighborhood. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey devises a plan to sneak into Dorothy's apartment that involves posing as an exterminator.The next day, Jeffrey picks up Sandy from her high school and they drive over to the apartment building where Dorothy lives. Dorothy believes Jeffrey's ruse and lets him into her apartment to spray for bugs. Unexpectedly, a man dressed in a yellow jacket (Fred Pickler) knocks on Dorothy's door while Jeffrey's in the kitchen, and Jeffrey takes advantage of the distraction to steal Dorothy's spare keys.That evening, Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's performance at the Slow Club. While Dorothy sings onstage, Jeffrey sneaks into her apartment to snoop. Sandy's parked outside of the building as a look-out in case Dorothy returns, but when she honks the car horn to warn Jeffrey, he doesn't hear it. He only has a few seconds to hide in a closet off the living room when he hears Dorothy approaching and unlocking the door. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, finds him hiding and threatens to hurt him. When she realizes he is merely a curious boy, she assumes his intentions are sexual in nature, and is excited by his voyeurism. She makes him undress at knife point, then performs an act of fellatio on him.Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) interrupts their encounter with a knock on the door. Dorothy urges Jeffrey to return to the closet and he witnesses Frank's bizarre sexual engagement with Dorothy in her living room, which includes gas inhalation/asphyxia with a mask, dry humping, and sado-masochistic acts. One of Frank's fetish objects is a blue velvet robe that he makes Dorothy wear during the ordeal. Frank is a foul-mouthed, violent sociopath whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. When Frank leaves, a saddened and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again. She demands that he also hit her but when he refuses she tells him to leave.The next day, Jeffrey tells Sandy a censored version of what he saw and concludes that Frank might have kidnapped Dorothy's husband Don (Dick Green) and young son Little Donny (Jon Jon Snipes), holding them hostage to extort sexual favors from Dorothy.The following evening, Jeffrey again observes Dorothy's show at the Slow Club, where she performs ""Blue Velvet"" by Bobby Vinton. Frank is also present at the nightclub. Later, in the car park, Jeffrey watches Frank and his three cohorts, Raymond (Brad Dourif), Paul (Jack Nance), and Hunter (J. Michael Hunter) drive away and follows them to Frank's apartment building in a desolate industrial area. Jeffrey returns and spends all night and day staking out the building and secretly photographing Frank and his visitors, which include the man in the yellow jacket (aka the Yellow Man) and a well-dressed man with a briefcase. He also follows Frank to a location where he is seen pointing in the distance to a gruesome drug-murder crime-scene investigation by the police.After reporting to Sandy on the bizarre and dangerous nature of Dorothy's situation, Jeffrey goes to Dorothy's apartment again and makes love to her, this time indulging her demands that he hit her. As he strikes her he notices she smiles. Just as he is leaving, Frank and his thugs arrive at the building and Frank forces them both to accompany him on a ""joyride,"" which ends up at the house of Ben (Dean Stockwell), a suave, effeminate partner in crime. Jeffrey overhears Frank talking to Ben about their accomplice, named Gordon, who murdered a drug courier in order to steal the drugs. Frank allows Dorothy to see her captive son in a back room -- Jeffrey overhears her pleading with her son to remember she's his mother. At Frank's request, Ben lip-synchs Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams,"" sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. He shouts to his crew that they're going for another high-speed joyride.Back on the road, Frank becomes more brutish and confrontational, taunting Dorothy as well as Jeffrey. When Frank pulls over at a sawmill yard and begins to abuse Dorothy, Jeffrey hits Frank, enraging him further. Frank and his thugs yank Jeffrey from the car and savagely beat him as ""In Dreams"" plays on the car stereo. Jeffrey wakes up on the ground the next morning and goes home, where he is overcome with guilt and despair. Jeffrey finally realizes that things have gone too far and decides to go to the police. At the police station, Jeffrey sees that Detective Williams' partner, Detective Gordon (the same ""Gordon"" that Frank mentioned earlier to Ben), is the ""Yellow Man"" and hurriedly leaves. Later, at Sandy's home, Jeffrey briefs Detective Williams on his findings. Williams reminds Jeffrey of the need to keep quiet. Jeffrey does not reveal Sandy's involvement.A few days later, Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance party together, profess their newfound love and embrace. As he drives Sandy home, they're followed and rear-ended several times by another driver. Jeffrey is relieved to discover that it's only Sandy's jealous ex-boyfriend Mike (Ken Stovitz). A confrontation is avoided when they see a naked and distressed Dorothy waiting on Jeffrey's front lawn -- she has been severely beaten and is covered in bruises. They drive Dorothy to Sandy's house where Dorothy reveals her clandestine sexual relationship with Jeffrey in front of Sandy and her mother.From the hospital, Jeffrey tells Sandy (who has already forgiven him for starting a romantic relationship with her while sexually involved with a vulnerable and mentally unstable woman) that he must return to Dorothy's apartment and asks Sandy to send her father there immediately. When he arrives at Dorothy's apartment, he finds the dead body of Dorothy's husband, who is missing an ear and has a swatch of blue velvet cloth stuck in his mouth. Detective Gordon is also there, standing in a daze with a severe head injury. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well Dressed Man coming up the steps and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Det. Williams over Gordon's police radio, but then remembers having seen Frank with a police radio as well. Jeffrey lies about his location inside the apartment, hoping Frank will assume he does not know about Frank's radio. Across town, Detective Williams and his men are engaged in a gunfight with Frank's thugs at his apartment building, and Jeffrey is on his own. Frank enters Dorothy's apartment and taunts Jeffrey about having heard Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. When Frank fails to find Jeffrey in the bedroom where Jeffrey announced over the radio that he'd hide, he returns to the living room. Upon Frank's opening the closet door, Jeffrey shoots him point-blank in the forehead with Det. Gordon's gun, killing him instantly. Det. Williams arrives with Sandy in tow. He points his pistol at Jeffrey and lowers it just after telling him ""it's all over.""Some time later, the Beaumont and Williams families enjoy an afternoon together. Jeffrey's father has recovered from his stroke and he and Det. Williams are talking in the back yard. Jeffrey points out a robin in a tree that's caught a bug. Sandy, who had earlier told Jeffrey about a dream she had involving robins and how they symbolized love, smiles with Jeffrey as they share this moment of contentment and hope.In another afternoon scene, Dorothy and her son play happily in the park together. She embraces the boy and a bittersweet expression comes across her face as Dorothy's voice sings the lyrics "". . . and I still can see blue velvet through my tears."" A pair of blue velvet curtains draw to a close, ending the story."

Radio DJ Vanita 'Stretch' Brock's open request night is plagued by the annoying phone pranking of two road tripping, party-hard, hoodlums, but things take a disturbing turn when the hoodlums meet their demise at the hands of familiar chainsaw wielding maniacs. With the entire gruesome ordeal recorded on tape, Stretch seeks out the help of a former Texas Marshall who's on a personal quest of vengeance against this family of cannibals. While at first he turns her down, he eventually decides to use her tape to his advantage, asking her to air it during her request block- effectively baiting the cannibals to the radio station where he'll personally deal with them.—ahmetkozan In an opening distainer, when Sally Hardesty-Enright (the survivor from the original) escaped from the cannibal family, she reported it to the authorities. Since she was so terrorized and terrified over what happened, she fell into a catatonic state of mental health. As for the authorities, they issued a month-long manhunt for these wanted criminals, but when they arrived at the house, absolutly nothing was found. No suspects were taken into custody, no evidence was obtained. Nothing was found and on the records, it was concluded that the massacre Sally described did not happen.13 years after 1973, after authorities came to the conclusion that there was no massacre in Muerto County, Texas, more brutal chainsaw murders occurred after remaining silent after over a decade of absence. Not only were the massacres of 1986 located in Austin like in 1973, but the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" state-wide killing spree. It wasn't until 14 years after the massacre of 1973 the state-wide massacres occuring across Texas were finally investigated upon.In the opening scene, a year after the massacres began occuring in more parts of Texas, two rowdy high school seniors are seen driving around in a Cadillac and whom are looking for nothing but a good time in celebration of their school football team's victory, started calling up Vantia Brock (also known as Stretch), a DJ for a rock station in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. A little later as it gets dark, the two teenage kids call Stretch again from their car phone drunk and crazy, but they paused on the phone for a second as they were in a car chase with a large pickup truck across a rural bridge. While the unseen driver of the pickup truck chases them in reverse, another man called Bubba (the killer from the first movie, also known as Leatherface as his nickname, which is revealed in this sequel) jumps out and turns on his large six-foot long chainsaw and destroys their vehicle and chops off the top of the head of the teenager driving the car. The other teen, left in the car with out any control over the stearing wheel at the time dies on impact when the car collides off the bridge. Stretch listens on the other line in a pure state of shock along with her co-worker, L.G., are left to wonder after the call what happened out there that night.The next day, local police officers clean up the scene of the crime along with Lefty Enright, an ex-State Trooper or Texas Ranger (the name of Texas State Troopers) now a Lieutenant Detective of a local precinct after most possibly being an official of the Texas State Police for about 40 years. When his commanding officer arrives, Lefty, now affected very very deeply of the loss of his nephew and the condition of his niece (possibly because he is very lonely due to his mental health since he is seen as a nut by his peers) starts to consult with him about how there is very definitely a cannibal family residing in Texas killing people and that how he would make a mistake if not being able to take the case. His superior officer tells Lefty that he will not be included in the investigation as Lefty leaves the crime scene.However, Lefty didn't take his commanding officer's order seriously and put up an ad in a newspaper advertising where he lives in case anyone has any information about the cannibalistic serial killers. Stretch as affected by those people visits Lefty in his apartment telling him that when the kids called her that night, she recorded it on tape and what she could do.After visiting Lefty, Stretch goes to a Chili Cook-Off with L.G. and watched the judges determine the winner in their best-tasting chili contest segment of the festival who evidently turned out to be no one, but Drayton Sawyer (Leatherface's older brother, who was the former owner of the service station in the first one, but now owns a kind-off a meals on wheels or in this case meats-on-wheels kind of food processer who decided to abandon the service station during the manhunt of 1973).After speaking with Stretch, Lefty vowing revenge ever since his family hit the dust, goes to a small hardware store where he purchases three large chainsaws costing hundreds of dollars. Now looking like a soldier, Lefty believes that ""those people should know how it feels like to be cut up in to pieces!!!""Meeting back up with Stretch, Lefty tells her that a great and effective tactic to use on these people would be to play the tape she recorded of their two last victums' grisly and gruesome murder over the radio luring the killers to the radio station for retaliation for ""screwing up their business"". Stretch took Lefty's advice and did so. Meanwhile, Drayton Sawyer, driving in his meals-on-wheels truck, hears the broadcast which angers him and he immediately makes a call from the phone in his truck to someone.Back at the radio station as night begins to fall, Strech is confronted by an obnoxious yet strange looking freak who is so-called Chop Top (another one of Leatherface's brothers who was in the Vietnam War during the first installment and is currently Leatherface's assistant in his killing spree and carries his brother, the Hitchiker, around who was ran over by a semi in the first movie who weared a metal plate in his head until his death that occurred 12 years before, giving him the nickname Plate-Head as well). Chop Top asks Strech at where she got the tape of the broadcast in which she refuses to answer him. Just then, Leatherface appears and attemps to kill her with his huge chainsaw with its six-foot long blade. Leatherface accidently hits Chop Top on his head with his chainsaw, exposing his large metal plate, but Chop Top is more or less uninjured. Stretch manages to briefly subdue Leatherface by spraying him with a fire exinquisher and then locks herself up in her office which has a steel door so that Leatherface cannot saw through the door. But instead Leatherface bursts through a wooden wall and confronts her. Stretch survives after Leatherface ends up looking at her at one point right before he was about to split her up and develops a crush on her and lets her live. Just then, L.G. arrives back at the station where Chop Top attacks him and beats him to death with a hammer. Leatherface then appears and lies by jesturing to Chop Top that he killed Stretch and destroyed the audio tape of their latest killing of the two teenagers on the bridge.The two insane killers then take L.G.'s dead body with them as they leave the radio station and drive away in Chop Top's pickup truck (the same truck involved in the two opening killings). Stretch follows them to their new home, the rundown and abandoned amusement park, called the Texas Battlelands Amusement Park, which is big enough to store the numerous remains of their many victims in as well. However, Lefty also is following Stretch as she pulled out of the radio station parking lot and followes her in his car to the deserted amuesment park. As he finally caught up with her, sort of, she falls through a hole in the middle of the ground filled with skulls and grisly remains of the family's previous victums. Lefty, absoulty furious and drowning in very very deep rage and emotions, takes a belt out of his car able to hold the two other chainsaws he purchased before in as he carries the biggest one he bought along with him as he cuts down the boundries around the park as he makes his way through the cave-like formations in the place where the family is residing and Stretch is trapped in as well.Meanwhile, Stretch is confronted by Leatherface in the slaughter room as he harrasses her and ties her up. Leatherface then tries to show his affection to her by gorily skinning L.G. and placing the skin of his face over hers. But then Leatherface is called out of the room by Drayton for some assistance. Just then L.G., who actually wasn't dead, revives and Stretch asks him to take the knife Leatherface used to skin him and set her free by cutting the ropes tying her together. After he does so, L.G. finally dies. Stretch takes off through the caves terrified and anxious to escape.In another section of the underground cave, the growing insane Lefty is freaked out just as well when he finds the skeleton of his wheelchair-bound departed nephew Franklin Hardesty-Enright who was murdered on August 18 1973 about 14 years ago and is now in display in his old wheelchair. Pure and filled completly with anger, hate, and maddness, Lefty makes his way through the caves in order to find destroy the Sawyer family.As Stretch makes her way out of the cave she ends up running back into Leatherface in which his brothers Drayton and Chop Top also appear to confront Stretch. When Chop Top tells Drayton that Leatherface earlier told him that she was dead, the now angry-than-ever Drayton goes crazy and for all seeing that ""Bubba"" was too much of a ""traitor"" to murder her. Unwilling to kill a person since he is only a cook, Drayton orders Leatherface to kill Stretch, but Leatherface refuses. Drayton angrily snatches the chainsaw away from Leatherface and walks away, ordering Leatherface to follow him back to the kitchen while he orders Chop Top to take care of Stretch for later which he responds by knocking her out with a hammer.Stretch wakes up a little later (with Lefty nowhere to be see) Sally-style, meaning that just like Sally Hardesty-Enright, she is bound to a chair in the family's new cavern-like dining room dinner table now surrounded the the entire Sawyer family which includes the 108-year-old Grandpa ""Grandad"" Sawyer, Bubba ""Leatherface"" Sawyer, Drayton Sawyer the cook, Edward ""Nubbins"" Sawyer's corpse (also known as the Hitchiker), and Robert ""Chop Top"" Sawyer"" all together for another family dinner.And like Sally, Stretch is presented to be the prize kill for Grandpa Sawyer and she almost gets killed by Grandpa with a blow to the head using a mallet. Suddenly, Lefty bursts through a wall in the dinning room and sees Stretch in their grasp. With Chop Top and Leatherface standing by to attack, Drayton has a conversation with Lefty who tells the cook that they took from him his niece Sally and his sanity and his poor deceased nephew Franklin. Drayton is unmoved and tells Lefty that he's just trying to run a business.Lefty then attacks wounds Drayton with his large chainsaw. Lefty then uses his chainsaw to free Stretch and tells to leave as he gives the cannibals exactly what they deserve (!) As the wounded Drayton crawls under the dinner table, he orders Leatherface to kill Lefty and orders Chop Top to go after Stretch to make sure she doesn't escape. Leatherface starts up his chainsaw and has a duel with Lefty in a Star Wars-like manner, but instead of lightsabers, with chainsaws (!)
Chop Top chases after Stretch as she runs through the cave passageways trying to find an exit.Back in the dining room, the duel with chainsaws reaches the climax as Lefty finally gets the upper hand against Leatherface and impales him with his chainsaw as they stand up on top of the dinner table. But Leatherface still will not go down that easily and he still holds his chainsaw after being slammed onto the dinner table as Lefty starts up his two other smaller chainsaws. Drayton continues hiding under the dinner table with the muffified body of the Hitchhiker which Drayton takes out a hand grenade that the Hitchhiker always had on him. Just then, the elderly Grandpa Sawyer stands up out of his chair and throws his mallet at Lefty who ducks and it hits Leatherface instead who drops his chainsaw on the table which hits Drayton underneath who drops the grenade. Lefty then screams a victory call right before the grenade goes off, apparently killing him the Sawyer family and destroying everything in it's path. Lefty's anger and agony he had for a long period of rough times is over (!)Meanwhile, Stretch has escaped the blast and is still being chased by Chop Top which she finds a skylight and makes it outside into the light of day where she finds herself inside the closed amusement park and standing before a large artificial hill. Chop Top continues to chase after her, but she kicks him off a ledge on the hill and continues climbing up the hill. However, once close to freedom, she encounters the muffified remains of Grandma Sawyer in a santuary at the top of the amusement park hill (!)The remains of Grandma apparently has a small chainsaw lodged in her hands and Stretch desperately tries to remove it to defend herself against Chop Top who climbs back up the ledge he fell off of. But Stretch has difficulty starting up the old chainsaw in which Chop Top attacks her with a straight razor cutting her several times on her back, neck, sholders and back of her head (similar to what the Hitchhiker was doing to Sally just before he got run over by a semi-trailer in the first movie). Just as he is about to kill her, Stretch finally starts up the chainsaw and impails him with it. The fataly wounded Chop Top then falls back off the ledge, hits the ground and falls back into the hole leading back into the underground cave where he chased her out of.The eerieness continues as Stretch looses her sanity at that moment, swinging the chainsaw around in the manner in a victory dance atop the hill similar to what Leatherface did as well in the ending of the first movie. The final shots shows the insane Stretch swinging the chainsaw and screaming in reaction to the hell she had been through."

In Wilmington, North Carolina, machines suddenly come to life and attack humans. A marquee sign about a bank displays an insult and an ATM calls a bank customer an ""asshole."" (The bank client is writer-director Stephen King, in a cameo.) The town's drawbridge suddenly lifts itself, spilling cars and trucks off of it, killing several people much to the shock of the elderly bridge keeper and his dim-witted assistant.At the Dixie Boy truck stop outside town, Bill Robinson (Emilio Estevez), a recently paroled prisoner from the state pen, working as the short order cook, meets with his new boss, Hendershot (Pat Hingle), the owner of the truck stop. The nasty redneck Hendershot has a system worked out to make life unbearable for parolees who come to work for him, mostly forcing them to work overtime for no pay (as part of his twisted way to exploit them). Hendershot threatens to send Bill back to prison if he doesn't agree to work for extra hours ""off the clock"".A few of the Dixie Boy's regulars drive up in their semi-haulers. One of them is a man, named Handy (Frankie Faison), who works for Happy Toyz and has a huge green goblin's face mounted on the front of his truck. Some time after he pulls up, his truck starts itself up and moves about 100 feet on its own. Handy can't believe it since he has the keys.While filling a vehicle with diesel fuel, mechanic Duncan Keller (J.C. Quinn) notices that the flow of diesel from the nozzle has stopped. He looks down the nozzle and it suddenly squirts him in the eyes, temporarily blinding him. Fellow employees, Steve (Barry Bell) and Joe (Pat Miller), tend to him.In the video game room, a would-be thief (Giancarlo Esposito) is stealing change from the machines and gets electrocuted by a huge surge of electricity from one of the video games.While tending the stove, the truck stop waitress Wanda June (Ellen McElduff) gets seriously injured when an electric carving knife turns itself on and cuts a deep cash on her left forearm. Bill runs in to tend to her wound and smashes the electric knife with a hammer.Meanwhile, at a junior league baseball game, the winning coach wants to buy sodas for his team. The soda machine swallows his money and then shoots the cans at high speed, hitting him first in the crotch, then in the head, killing him. The machine spits more cans at the players, who run from the field. One of the players, Deke (Holter Graham), a catcher, quickly puts his catcher's mask over his face when several cans fly toward him. Suddenly, a steamroller breaks through the scoreboard and runs over one of the young players. Deke notices that the steamroller has no driver. He mounts his bicycle and races off.On a deserted freeway, a female hitchhiker, named Brett Graham (Laura Harrington), is riding with a gross lecherous Bible salesman and con artist, named Loman (Christopher Murney), who makes inappropriate passes against her. Trying to get a signal on the car radio, Brett briefly hears a vague news announcement, over garbled and static broadcasting, speaking of ""unexplained events"" being reported, as well as about the local microwave facilities being inoperative, and issuing a urgent message to ""get away at once"" from all the local roads or major highways. Brett is forced to grab the steering wheel and pull into the Dixie Boy truck stop when Loman does not stop. They argue over this when the Happy Toyz truck starts by itself while Joe is still filling it with fuel and it moves a short distance. Upon checking the inside to the truck's cab, Bill finds the cabin empty. Brett notices that there are no cars on the road at all, something unusual for 10:30 am in the morning.In town, Duncan's son, Deke, sees that many people have been killed at their homes by machines. He hears another garbled radio broadcast about machines all over the world coming to life and killing people. One of them is a blood-splattered runaway lawnmower, which chases him but he is able to easily outrun it on his bike. He then hides from a driver less ice cream truck, which doesn't detect him in the bushes. Deke waits until the truck is gone and rides for the Dixie Boy where his father works.On another back road, a ditsy redneck newlywed couple, Curt (John Short) and Connie (Yeardley Smith), are driving toward their honeymoon destination. They notice that there are many stalled and wrecked cars along the road. They pull into a local garage to find the mechanic dead, and a tow-truck starting up and trying to run them down. Curt manages to duck out of the way and the tow truck crashes into the garage. Curt and Connie then drive away.Back at the Dixie Boy, Duncan attempts to leave to look for his son despite protests from Bill and threats from Hendershot (implying that Duncan is also an ex-con and that Hendershot is exploiting his background for his own gain). But while walking to his truck, one of the sedate trucks starts up and runs over Duncan, killing him. The con-artist Bible salesman, Camp Loman, runs out to insult the ""driver"" only to realize that no one is driving the truck. The Happy Toyz truck starts up again and chases Loman a short distance and backs up into him, sending him flying and landing in a nearby ditch. Steve and Handy then drag Duncan's dead body back inside and Hendershot orders him to be placed in the basement with the dead body of the video game player. With the phones and CB radios out of order, the group inside the truck stop debates on what to do next when all of the 18-wheeler semi trucks at the truck stop start up and begin to drive in a circle around the truck stop building, trapping the people inside.Back on the deserted highway, Curtis and Connie spot a long convoy of driver less trucks traveling on the opposite end of the road when one of the trucks, an older model flatbed, notices them and begins to chase them. Curtis is able to maneuver away from the truck and cause it to crash off an embankment, destroying it. He sees the sign for the Dixie Boy and takes the exit.Upon arrival, Curtis and Connie see the truck stop under siege by the circling trucks and when Curtis attempts to drive through the circle to reach the safety of the inside, their car is hit and gets toppled over by one of the trucks. Bill and Brett run outside and rescue Curtis and Connie and as they run back, Hendershot walks out with a M-72 66mm LAW (light anti-tank) rocket launcher and blows up two of the trucks with anti-tank rockets, saving them.A little later, Bill asks Joe about the weapons Hendershot has in the basement. Bill and Brett venture to the cellar and discover a huge stash of weapons ranging from assault rifles to rocket launchers to grenades. Hendershot appears and threatens to send Bill back to prison for snooping around, but Bill arms himself and warns Hendershot not to interfere with him. Bill confides in Brett about his criminal past about robbing a grocery store and his predicament and that Hendershot does not seem to take anything seriously.At nightfall, the power in the truck stop goes out as the trucks continue circling the building. Brett notices a bright green light covering the sky and deducts that the passing comet is responsible. Bill suggests traveling to an island where there are no vehicles or machines and hide out until it is all over.A little later, when everyone hears the sounds of the injured Camp Loman screaming from the ditch where he landed earlier, Bill and Curt volunteer to go out to rescue him. Carrying weapons borrowed from Hendershot's arsenal as well as rope, they run to a nearby building past the trucks (many of which are starting to run out of fuel) and lower themselves into a nearby sewer drainpipe to lead to the ditch where Loman is.In the meantime, Deke has made it to the Dixie Boy and crawls through another drainpipe to the creek where Loman is, but the wounded and near-death Bible salesman, by this time has become insane and tries to kill Deke when he approaches him. Bill and Curt come by and grab Deke away as a dump truck spots them and attempts to run them down, forcing them leave behind Loman (whom is presumably dead by this point) and back into the drainpipe. They make it back to the showers building and run across the parking lot back to the Dixie Boy, with Bill blowing up another truck with his rocket launcher. Bill at first refuses to tell Deke where his father is until Hendershot blurts out that Duncan was killed earlier by one of the trucks. Deke is devastated, while everyone (Brett most of all) is angry at Hendershot for being so insensitive. Hendershot remains oblivious to his own actions.The next morning, most of the trucks have stalled, having run out of gas. However, two more trucks arrive, they are a large bulldozer and a small military vehicle with a M-60 machine gun mounted. When the bulldozer crashes into the building, Hendershot (despite the protests from Bill) fires a rocket at it, temporarily disabling it. As a result, the military vehicle opens fire on the Dixie Boy building. In the storm of bullets, Hendershot, Wanda June, and three of the truck drivers are fatally gunned down. Then the military vehicle begins beeping its horn in a Morse code message which Deke translates as ""Someone must pump fuel. Someone will not be harmed. All fuel must be pumped.""When the power for the building comes on again, Bill decides to turn on the pumps, despite Brett's protests not to trust the trucks. Bill points out that they have to with the military vehicle's presence. Over most of the day, in 100F degree heat, Bill, Brett, Deke, Curtis, and a few others take turns venturing outside and refueling all the trucks, plus hundreds more trucks that arrive at the Dixie Boy to refuel. When the fuel runs out, a driver less tanker truck appears and beckons Bill to refill the truck stop's fuel tanks to continue the refueling.Exhausted by the hard work and the heat, Bill retires to rest where Brett comforts him. Bill points out a possible explanation for these events as being a race of aliens using the comet to wipe out humanity and having the machines making them work as their slaves.Handy tells Bill about working on an escape where they will get out through the basement and to a drainage pipe to the outside. Sometime later, Bill walks outside where he talks to another truck driver filling up the trucks where he drops a grenade into the small military vehicle, destroying it. With that, all of the refueled trucks begin circling the Dixie Boy once again.At nightfall, Bill, Brett, Deke, Curtis, Connie and the rest of the survivors escape through the drainage pipe, armed with various weapons from the late Hendershot's arsenal and decide to make a run for the open ocean and to the island where there are no trucks. When the trucks see that the people inside the Dixie Boy are gone, they all smash into the building, destroying it in a series of spectacular explosions.Bill leads the survivors across the back roads and fields in the area to make it to the local marina to find a sailboat to take them to the island. They have narrow encounters with numerous machines including the driver less ice cream truck. Upon arrival at the marina, they all head out to a sailboat when one of the truck drivers, named Brad (Leon Rippy), attempts to steal a diamond ring from the corpse of a woman (Marla Maples) caught in her car passenger window when the leader of the living trucks, the Green Goblin of Happy Toyz, arrives and runs down Brad, killing him. Bill runs from the docks and quickly destroys the Happy Toyz truck with a rocket launcher.In the final shot, Bill, Brett and the rest of the dozen survivors sail away from the marina to find help and safety. A disclaimer in the final shot reveals that two days later a Russian ""weather satellite"" destroyed a large UFO orbiting Earth with nuclear tipped missiles, causing all machines to become sedate. Another two days later, Earth passed through the tail of the comet and everything seemingly returned to normal. It is also implied that the Dixie Boy survivors were the only survivors to the worldwide machine revolt."

The Boy Who Could Fly,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090768/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An autistic boy who dreams of flying touches everyone he meets, including a new family who has moved in after their father dies. Charlene Michaelson, her two children - teen-aged Amelia 'Milly' Michaelson and precocious adolescent Louis Michaelson - and their dog Max move into a new house in a new neighborhood after the passing of Charlene's husband/the kids' father, Donald Michaelson. Beyond life without Donald, they are all nervous about starting a new life, which, for Charlene, means getting back into the workforce after thirteen years. Milly quickly settles into the neighborhood if only because she becomes fascinated with their next door neighbor, teen-aged Eric Gibb, who authorities believe is autistic. Orphaned Eric has never spoken a word, and without having been told about the incident, began to think he could fly at the exact moment his parents died in a plane crash. Many believe Eric's belief is because he felt he could thus save his parents. Eric's guardian is his dipsomaniac Uncle Hugo Gibb. Milly's high school teacher, Mrs. Carolyn Sherman, who used to be a special needs teacher, looks after Eric as much as anyone. Mrs. Sherman believes that having Eric in her class with ""normal"" students is a positive environment for him, unlike the authorities who believe he should be institutionalized. Milly's official and unofficial tasks become to see what lies deep within Eric's psyche, and if there really is any validity to what people think Eric believes.—Huggo Milly and Louis, and their recently-widowed mom, Charlene, move to a new neighborhood. Once there, they all deal with a variety of personal problems, but Milly finds a friend in Eric, her autistic next door neighbor. Eric has a fascination with flight, and as the story progresses, he exerts an enthralling force of change on all those around him.—William Agee <wa0521@broncho.ucok.edu> In the 1986 film The Boy Who Could Fly, Jay Underwood plays Eric Gibb, an autistic boy who lives with his alcoholic uncle Hugo Gibb (played by Fred Gwynne) and befriends the new girl next door, Millie Michaelson. Because Eric is unable to verbally communicate and his parents died when he was five in a plane crash, Eric faces the constant threat of institutionalization by unsympathetic social workers who believe he is a threat to himself and the community because Eric has an affinity for climbing onto rooftops and standing on window sills. Throughout the film, audiences often see Eric standing with arms outstretched and eyes closed, as if he believes that he is flying or can fly. At school, Eric's English teacher Mrs. Sheridan (played by Colleen Dewherst) advocates for him and encourages Millie to bond with Eric. In the months that follow, Eric and Millie form a close bond and Millie begins to suspect that there is more to Eric than appears. Specifically, Millie begins to suspect that Eric actually can fly, especially when he appears to jump from her windowsill to his and when he saves her from falling off a bridge on a school trip to the zoo. While Millie cannot remember Eric flying to save her, she can come up with no other explanation for her miraculous rescue. Unfortunately when Hugo goes on a drinking binge, social workers remove Eric from his home and place him in an institution where Eric is heavily medicated and often restrained. Millie eventually helps Eric escape from the institution and when confronted by social workers and the police at their high school, Eric grabs Millie's hand and the two literally fly away from the school and soar over rooftops to Millie's home. In a scene reminiscent from E.T., Millie and her family face the onslaught of reporters and scientists investigating the boy who could fly while Eric disappears forever into the clouds.—st_rgregory 15-year-old Amelia, called Milly, and her family move into a new suburban home shortly after the death of her father. Milly makes friends with her new neighbor Geneva, and Milly and her eight-year-old brother Louis have difficulty adjusting to their new schools, while their mother Charlene copes with a demotion at work and her inability to learn how to use a computer. Louis is also plagued by bullies down the street who won't let him get around the block. During the first night at the house, Charlene tells Milly she will need her help to make this work. Milly returns to her bedroom and is talking to her pet bird when something flies past the window, but when Milly goes to investigate she sees nothing.Milly and Geneva observe Eric Gibb, an autistic boy living next door with his alcoholic uncle Hugo. Eric has never spoken a word in his life, doesn't like to be around people and exhibits bizarre behavior related to flying, such as balancing on the roof of his house with his arms spread out like an airplane. Milly hears that Eric's parents died in a plane crash, and that somehow, in the instant of their death, he knew; and that he did the only thing he could think of to try to save them, which was to become an airplane. Later that night, Milly and her family watch as Eric (along with Milly's teacher Mrs. Sherman) and three adults appear outside with Eric in a straight jacket and being restrained by two men, with Mrs. Sherman arguing with a woman there about what is best for Eric. Milly later reveals to Geneva that she finds Eric attractive.Although Eric cannot communicate with anyone, he begins to react to Milly, first by mimicking her movements and facial expressions. Her teacher, Mrs. Sherman, observes this interaction and asks Milly to keep an eye on Eric. Mrs. Sherman explains that, because of uncle Hugo's drinking, Eric is in constant danger of being taken by authorities and placed in a hospital; but that when Eric was taken away before, he became so sick that he almost died.Milly works with Eric over the course of the school year and takes notes on his progress, which is slow at first. Milly notes excitedly the first time Eric smiles on his own rather than merely copying her own smile. Eric does nothing when Milly throws balls to him, except for one day when he spontaneously reaches out and catches a stray baseball flying toward Milly's head. However, strange occurrences, like Eric's apparent ability to appear in his own window one instant, and in Milly's the next, begin to make Milly question reality. In her notes, Milly wonders whether Eric is becoming more like her, or the other way around.On a school field trip, with no one present except Eric, Milly falls off a bridge while trying to pick a rose. Knocked unconscious, she dreams that she wakes up in the hospital, with Eric sat on the windowsill. After a conversation with him (albeit wordless on Eric's part), she becomes convinced he can fly. Eric gives her the rose she was trying to reach and then, taking her hand, leads her out of the window and the two begin flying. The two watch a fireworks display from a cloud before they share a kiss and return to the hospital window. After watching Eric fly off, Milly's dream becomes a nightmare as she sees her father in a hospital bed, dead, with a girl called Mona (who Milly told to throw a basketball at her head earlier) throwing a basketball at her which knocks her out of the window.Milly then wakes up in a hospital and tells her mother that Eric can fly and that he caught her as she fell. A shrink called Doctor Grenader talks to Milly, who tells Doctor Grenader that Eric caught her as she only has a concussion and no serious injuries.Upon returning home, Milly notices the rose on her windowsill and now becomes truly convinced that Eric can fly. When she shouts to Uncle Hugo about Eric's whereabouts, he replies by saying the institute has taken him away as Hugo was found drunk again. Despite the efforts of Milly and her family, they are not allowed to see Eric when they visit the institute. As they leave, Eric tries to force the window open and is restrained by two men who try to sedate him. Another attempt by Louis to get around the block fails as the bullies tear his tricycle apart and to make matters worse, his dog Max is hit by a passing car and is taken to an animal hospital.Later that evening, Milly thinks she spots Eric on his roof during a thunderstorm and after climbing into the attic, she finds Eric, who is shivering with cold and still wearing a straight jacket after managing to somehow escape the institute. As Milly helps him, he pulls out a box and from within it, he takes out a ring which he gives to Milly. When the authorities arrive at Eric's house the next day, Milly sneaks Eric out and the police chase them to the roof of the school during a carnival. Eric turns to Milly and speaks her name, the first word he has spoken thus far. Milly asks Eric if he really can fly, and he smiles and nods his head. He holds her hand and the two fall off the building.Just before hitting the ground, Milly and Eric begin flying in plain view of the crowd around the carnival, which follows Milly and Eric down the streets of their town, shocking Charlene, Louis, Geneva and Uncle Hugo. Eric brings Milly to her own window, tells her he loves her and kisses her before he says goodbye and flies away. Milly is heartbroken, but quickly realizes why Eric had to leave.Over the following weeks, spectators, policemen and scientists mob the town, looking for an explanation and taking all of Eric's belongings away to be analyzed. Milly speculates that Eric too would have been taken by scientists had he remained.It is revealed that Milly's father knew he had cancer, but kept it a secret from his family because he did not want them to worry. Rather than seek treatment, he said goodbye and committed suicide. His refusal to fight for life left the Michaelsons feeling helpless and hopeless, but Eric's ability to fly shows them that anything is possible if you believe. Unlike Milly's father, Eric's uncle and the remaining Michaelsons refuse to give up: Eric's uncle beats his drinking problem and gets an excellent job; The Michaelson's dog Max gets better; Louis dominates the bullies down the street (with some help from Max); Charlene masters the computer at work; and Milly regains interest in her life and relationships with those around her. The movie ends with Milly looking out the window, hoping Eric will return someday. As the sun sets, she throws out a paper airplane and the credits roll."
The Name of the Rose,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091605/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An intellectually nonconformist friar investigates a series of mysterious deaths in an isolated abbey. 14. century Franciscan monk William of Baskerville and his young novice arrive at a conference to find that several monks have been murdered under mysterious circumstances. To solve the crimes, William must rise up against the Church's authority and fight the shadowy conspiracy of monastery monks using only his intelligence which is considerable.—yusufpiskin 1327. After a mysterious death in a Benedictine Abbey, the monks are convinced that the apocalypse is coming. With the Abbey to play host to a council on the Franciscan's Order's belief that the Church should rid itself of wealth, William von Baskerville, a respected Franciscan friar, is asked to assist in determining the cause of the untimely death. Alas, more deaths occur as the investigation draws closer to uncovering the secret the Abbey wants hidden, and there is finally no stopping the Holy Inquisition from taking an active hand in the process. William and his young novice must race against time to prove the innocence of the unjustly accused and avoid the wrath of Holy Inquisitor Bernardo Gui.—Rick Munoz <rick.munoz@his.com> The movie opens with the arrival of Franciscan friar William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his novice assistant, Adso of Melk (Christian Slater) at a Benedictine Abbey in Northern Italy in 1327. They are there to attend an important conference.The abbey is in fear, however, over the recent death of one of their young monks, a brilliant illustrator. He was found killed by an impact at the base of a cliff outside the abbey, but there was no access to the roof or through a sealed window from which he could have fallen. Many of the monks fear that there can be only an evil, supernatural explanation.The Abbot (Michael Lonsdale) asks William to help solve the mystery as he is known to be a man of great intellect and a former investigator for the inquisition. William examines the evidence and comes to the conclusion the monk fell from a tower in a different section of the abbey and body rolled downhill to where it was found. He also believes it was suicide as there was no other reason for the monk to be in the tower that time of night and a murderer would not have bothered to carry the body up the stairs to get rid of it.With the Abbot assuaged the conference begins, but immediately another death takes place. A Greek translator (Urs Althaus) is found upside down and head first in a huge pot. When the body is cleaned William finds that the man has blackened fingers on his right hand and a blackened tongue.William and Adso try and examine the desks of the two dead men, but are blocked from seeing the translator's desk by the assistant librarian (Michael Habeck). Later that night, after the monks are done with their work, the two return to see what the assistant librarian was hiding. The assistant librarian is still there, however, chuckling over a book. Upon hearing their approach he takes the book and hides. On the translator's desk William finds a cryptic note that is partly written in invisible ink. It seems to give directions to a secret location in the adjacent library.The assistant librarian tosses a tool across the room distracting the two and escapes. William and Adso go after him and split up to search the Abbey. Adso wanders into the storehouse and hides when monk Remigio da Varagine (Helmut Qualtinger) checks the area for intruders. Adso is surprised when he finds a teenage girl (Valentina Vargas) with him in his hiding place. He is even more surprised when she makes passionate love to him before disappearing into the night.Meanwhile William is outside engaging hunchback monk Salvatore (Ron Perlman) in conversation. Salvatore is a half-wit who, along with Remigio, is a former member of a heretical cult. William finds this out and uses the information to force their cooperation. Salvatore tells him what he has seen happen between the illustrator, translator and assistant librarian.The next day the body of the assistant librarian is found by the abbey herbalist (Elya Baskin) submerged in a bathtub. This body too has blackened fingers and tongue. William goes to the Abbott with what he believes is the explanation for the deaths. He believes that the illustrator traded sexual favors with the assistant librarian to get access to a forbidden book: a comedy by Aristotle. Overwhelmed by guilt over what he had done, the illustrator took his own life, but not before he has passed the secret of where to find the book to his friend, the Greek Translator. The Greek translator also read the book, and later the assistant librarian. Both died of a ""book that kills"". The assistant librarian put the Greek translator's body into the pot to throw suspicion away from himself, before dying while trying to take a bath.The Abbott, underwhelmed by this explanation, burns the paper which is Williams only evidence and tells him he has concluded that he has no choice but to call in the Papal inquisition to get to the bottom of things. Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham), an investigator who nearly got William executed in the past, will be arriving to take charge.William had asked the librarian (Volker Prechtel) for access to the library, but it was denied. Later he and Adso pressure Remigio to help them sneak in and find that the massive library tower is a labyrinth of rooms and passages. They use a copy of the directions to locate what they believe is the entrance to a secret room, but they fail to figure out how to open it.The next day William is interrupted during the conference by the Abbey herbalist who whispers to William that he has found the secret book hidden behind a jar in his building. Before William can excuse himself from the conference, however, the herbalist is killed by the librarian and the book taken back.That night a fire erupts in the storeroom and Bernardo catches Salvatore there with the teenage girl. He concludes that the girl is a witch, the monk has made a deal with the Satan and they are responsible for the deaths. William, however, realizes that it is more likely that the girl was exchanging sexual favors with Salvatore for food. Despite this Bernardo decides to sentence the girl, Salvatore and Remigio (by virtue of his earlier membership in the heretical cult) to burn at the stake. Because he refused to confirm Bernardo's pronouncement, William himself will be brought up on charges.During vespers that afternoon the librarian keels over and dies. His fingers and tongue are black. In the resulting confusion William and Adso manage to slip away from their guards and get back into the tower library. They hope to find evidence that will force the executions to be halted. They find their way to the secret door and solve the riddle of how to open it. Proceeding into the secret room they find Jorge de Burgos (Feodor Chaliapin Jr.), a blind and humorless senior member of the Abbey, with the secret book. Jorge invites William and Adso to examine it. William does, but puts on a glove first (though Jorge cannot see this as he is blind). William then tells Jorge that he knows that Jorge hates the book (as it is comedy and by his lights, evil) and has placed a deadly poison on the pages. That is the reason that all who read the book died (from licking their hand to turn the leaves). When William tells Jorge he is wearing a glove, Jorge snatches the book back and in the ensuing chase a candle is knocked over setting the library on fire. Jorge hides and while hiding starts to eat pages of the book.Outside the Abbey the girl, Salvatore and Remigio have been tied to stakes. Before the girl's can be ignited, however, Bernardo, the monks and guards notice the library tower is on fire. They run back to the Abbey while the girl is rescued by her peasant friends. It is too late for Salvatore and Remigio, however, and they burn to death. Bernardo, seeing the library on fire, decides things are out of control and it is time to leave the Abbey post-haste. The peasants are still mad at his sentence on the girl, however, and topple his wagon off the road and down a cliff where he is fatally impaled on a farm implement.While chasing Jorge, Adso and William are separated. William orders Adso out of the building as he and Jorge are apparently trapped by the fire. Jorge dies of poisoning from the poisoned ink that he ate. Adso makes it out and, at the last minute, so does William after having rescued a handful of important books. They depart the smoldering Abbey and on the way Adso sees the girl one last time. The narrator, Adso in his old age, reports that she was his only terrenal love, but he never knew her name. The credits roll."

Now, women forget all those things they don't want to remember and remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the truth. Then they act and do things accordingly."" - Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God. ""In Brooklyn, New York, graphic artist Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) juggles several lovers, believing this to be normal behavior. She makes love to her boyfriend, Jamie Overstreet (Tommy Redmond Hicks), surrounded by candles. Her former roommate, Clorinda Bradford (Joie Lee), moved out because on weekends she would find Nola's many boyfriends in the bathroom. Nola avoids forming attachments with ""dogs,"" men with crude pick-up lines, who believe that a relationship begins and ends with sex. Jamie's charm is what first attracted her.Another lover, ""Mars"" Blackmon (Spike Lee), is a bicycle messenger with an arrow design sculpted into the back of his head. When Nola invites him to her apartment for the first time, he suggests they could be roommates, but Nola is not interested.

After she hangs up, Jamie asks why she is attracted to Mars, but she does not respond.Mars makes Nola laugh but she believes he is in love with her lovemaking, not with her.

Later, Greer accuses her of being a sex addict, and suggests that she see a therapist. When Nola sees sex therapist Dr. Jamison (Epatha Merkinson), he concludes that she has a healthy sex drive and is not an addict.In time, Nola cooks Thanksgiving dinner and invites all three of her lovers. They proceed to insult each other. Mars accuses Greer of being a Celtics fan, and proposes that he and Jamie do a 60-40 split each week to share time with Nola.

When Nola breaks up with Greer, he insults her. Afterward, Nola ends her relationship with Mars, who takes the rejection gracefully, and makes her laugh.Nola returns to Jamie, and tells him she is willing to commit only to him, but suggests they take a break from having sex.

While descending down a ventilation shaft, he discovers Nina in the locked closet and gets her out. She then agrees to help Quint steal the Black Moon.

This looks like the end of Ponyland, unless all the magical creatures of Dream Valley answer the Little Ponies' call for help.—Brendan Richards <sierra_oscar_85@hotmail.com> At their home, Dream Castle, the ponies are running and playing through flowery meadows and grassy green fields with their animal friends. Elsewhere, Baby Lickety-Split is practicing a new dance step, as Spike, a baby dragon, accompanies her rehearsal on the piano. Meanwhile, at the Volcano of Gloom, a wicked witch named Hydra is planning to ruin the ponies festival, but her two incompetent daughters, Reeka and Draggle, are not up to her family's standards of wickedness, and she laments about it, before sending them off to ruin the festival. During the baby ponies' dance performance, Baby Lickety-Split attempts to add her own dance and ruins the whole performance. She is rebuked by everyone and runs away, followed by Spike, only to end up falling down a waterfall and trapped in a valley. Meanwhile, Reeka and Draggle attempt to ruin the ponies' festival by flooding the area, but thanks to the Sea Ponies, end up getting washed away in an overflowing waterfall.The ponies send out a search party to find Baby Lickety-Split and Spike, while Hydia decides to concoct the Smooze, an unstoppable ooze that will bury and destroy everything in its path. It will also make anyone splashed by it grumpy and woeful. Her daughters go and collect the ingredients for the Smooze, leaving out the flume, an ingredient that they are afraid of retrieving. Hydia releases the Smooze which rages towards Dream Castle, trapping Spike and Baby Lickety-Split inside a mountain. All the ponies are forced to evacuate as the castle and the surrounding land are submerged by the Smooze. The search party continues its attempt to locate Lickety-Split before the Smooze engulfs them.Later, the two Pegasus ponies, Wind Whistle and North Star, travel to the human world to fetch Megan, the keeper of the Rainbow locket, bringing Megan's younger siblings, Danny and Molly, along as well. Megan releases the Rainbow into the Smooze, but it is swallowed up and lost but this does halt the Smooze. The ponies are discouraged by this, but Megan offers the encouragement that another rainbow lies out there. Enraged, Hydia discovers the Smooze was lacking flume and sends her daughters to get the missing ingredient from an octopus-like plant monster that lives on a rocky outcrop near the volcano. The monster punishes the sisters, until Reeka bites a tentacle, thereby injuring the plant, and they escape with some flume. Hydia adds this to the Smooze, which is then reactivated.Megan accompanies two ponies to the Moonchick, who gives the trio a new home (Paradise Estate) and a map to find the Flutter Ponies who might stop the Smooze. A group lead by Megan sets out to find Flutter Valley, while Spike and Baby Lickety-Split run into five ugly but well-meaning creatures called Grundles, whose home, Grundleland, was covered by the Smooze in the past. Meanwhile, on the quest to find the Flutter Ponies, Megan gets lost in a field of giant sunflowers, almost becoming a victim of the Smooze. Hydia sees the Smooze has failed to kill the ponies and send her pet, Ahgg, after them. Meanwhile, Spike, Baby Lickety-Split, and the Grundles almost fall victim to the Smooze, with Spike's tail being smoozed, but they escape but floating down the river on a log, and end up in a clearing by a well, where Baby Lickety-Split, feeling down about the situation she is in, hears echoes in the well and rescues Morning Glory, a Flutter Pony who fell in earlier. She is informed of the Smooze and so promises to lead them to Flutter Valley.Meanwhile, the team on a quest to find the Flutter Ponies press on through Shadow Forest, where they are attacked by sentient trees which fire sharp branches at them. After escaping the forest, they find that the high narrow final pass into Flutter Valley is blocked by Ahgg, a giant spider, and its web, and Megan is once more in danger, but is saved by Wind Whistle. When out of the canyon, the group finds Flutter Valley and meet with the queen Rosedust, who refuses to get involved at first, until Baby Lickety-Split arrives, safe and sound, along the Spike, the Grundles, and Morning Glory. There is much argument about non-involvement in other ponies' problems from the Flutter Ponies. Even though Morning Glory pleads with the queen their help their cousins, Rosedust still hesitates, until after Baby Lickety-Split appears to sway her enough to help in the defeat of the Smooze.The other ponies and forest animals are about to be covered by the Smooze as the witches watch from their ship. The Flutter Ponies come to the rescue and destroy the Smooze, with their magical wind, Utter Flutter uncover the rainbow and drop the witches back into the volcano with the sticky goo. The Grundles are given the ruins of Dream Castle, all the ponies and Spike who were covered in the Smooze are cleaned by the Flutter Ponies by Utter Flutter, and the Rainbow of Light is returned to the ponies. With all problems resolved, the ponies take Megan and her siblings back home."
Highlander,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091203/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An immortal Scottish swordsman must confront the last of his immortal opponents, a murderously brutal barbarian who lusts for the fabled ""Prize"". In New York City, the owner of a sophisticated antique shop Russell Edwin Nash is challenged to a sword fight in the parking lot of the Madison Square Garden by a man called Iman Fasil that is beheaded by Russell. He hides his sword and is arrested by the police while leaving the stadium. Russell recalls his life in the sixteenth century in Scotland, when he is Connor MacLeod, and is fatally wounded in a battle against another Clan. However, he surprisingly survives and his Clan believes he has a pact with the devil and expels him from their lands. Then he meets Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, who explains that he is immortal unless he is beheaded. Further, the immortals dispute a game killing each other and in the end only one survives receiving a prize with the power of the other immortals. Russell is released by the police, but the snoopy forensic agent Brenda J. Wyatt is attracted by the case since she found fragments of an ancient Katana and follows Russell. But the also immortal Kurgan is hunting down MacLeod, and Brenda is in the middle of their battle.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Born in the Highlands of Scotland in 1518, Connor MacLeod is immortal. When he is wounded in battle but does not die, he is banished from his village. He meets another like himself, Ramirez, who teaches him swordsmanship, the only way to kill another immortal is to take his head, and the ways of the immortals. Modern-day New York City is the location of ""The Gathering"", where Connor and the few remaining immortals must battle to the last for ""The Prize"".—Jeff Hansen <jmh@umich.edu> After centuries of duelling to survive against others like him, an immortal Scottish swordsman faces his final opponent: a bloodthirsty barbarian who has chased him across time to 1985 New York City, where they fight for the Prize: the spiritual ability to know everything.—famouscasey Connor MacLeod was born in 1518 in the Highlands of Scotland. In 1536, after facing a mysterious, evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, MacLeod is met by Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches Macleod the awful truth. He is immortal, one of a race of many who can only die when the head is cut from the body. When one immortal takes the head of another, the loser's power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches MacLeod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is tragically killed by Connor's ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan, a murderous immortal brute who lusts for the ultimate power of the immortals, ""The Prize"", enough power to rule the Earth forever. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize. The time: 1985. The place: New York City. The final fight is about to begin, and in the end, there can be only one.—Weapon X <jlseltzer@earthlink.net> In 1985, a man named Russell Nash (Christopher Lambert) is attending a wrestling match at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Looking somewhat forlorn, he feels a strange tremor and is compelled to leave. As he heads to his car, Nash is confronted by a man named Iman Fasil. Fasil identifies Nash by his real name, Connor MacLeod, and challenges him to a duel. Connor reluctantly accepts, and draws a katana. After a fierce sword fight, Connor decapitates Fasil and is enveloped by a mysterious energy which destroys several cars around him. He quickly hides his sword in one of the light racks hanging from the ceiling. Before he can leave the garage he is arrested by the police, who take him for questioning.The story goes back to Scotland in 1536, where an 18-year old Connor is seen with his fiance, Kate (Celia Imrie), and war-weary cousins Angus (James Cosmo) and Dugal (Billy Hartman). Their clan is preparing for war against their longtime rivals, Clan Fraser.Detectives Moran (Alan North) and Garfield (Edward Wiley) are attempting to interrogate Connor. Garfield loses his cool and assaults Connor. This incident, coupled with lack of evidence, results in Connor's release. Forensics expert Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) is intrigued by Fasil's sword, as it is a very valuable historical artifact, probably worth over a million dollars. Later, Connor returns to the garage to retrieve the katana, but before he does he sees that Brenda is looking at the crime scene. She finds some metal shards embedded in a nearby concrete column and saves them for analysis.The scene returns to the Highlands, where the armies of Clan Fraser and Clan MacLeod are preparing to face each other in battle. Clan Fraser's leader, Chief Murdoch (Alistair Findlay), has taken on the services of the Kurgan (Clancy Brown), a imposing mercenary in black leather armor. The Kurgan tells Murdoch that he wants to kill Connor on the battlefield and that nobody else should fight him. The battle begins and Connor, who has never been in battle before, is very scared. He soon finds nobody wants to fight him, but eventually the Kurgan finds him and easily defeats Connor by stabbing him in the chest, shouting ""there are can be only one!"" Dugal and Angus see the Kurgan preparing to decapitate Connor and attack him, forcing him to retreat. Connor is taken back to the village but is so badly wounded everybody assumes he is going to die.We learn that Connor, in his Russell Nash persona, is an antiquities dealer and seems to be quite wealthy. A very pretty older woman named Rachel Ellenstein (Sheila Gish) is his assistant. Later, the Kurgan, now wearingJudas Prieststagewear and sporting a hideous scar on his neck, drives into the city after hearing of Fasil's death. Using the alias Victor Kruger, he takes up residence at a seedy motel and assembles his sectional ""bastard sword,"" made from composite alloys. He practices his technique, taking the occasional break for dalliances with prostitutes.Connor follows Brenda to a bar where they strike up a conversation and Brenda becomes very interested in him. They both leave and as Brenda tries to follow Connor he is attacked by Kruger. They fight but Connor is at an obvious disadvantage without a sword. The fight is interrupted by a police helicopter and everybody flees.Connor has made a remarkable recovery and is now back to normal, in only a few days. While he is happy to be alive, his friends ostracize him. Kate says that his recovery is the work of the devil. Most everybody in the clan mirrors that sentiment. Eventually the townspeople form a mob, tie him to a pole, and take him out to be executed -- but Angus frees him, convincing the villagers to commute the death sentence in favor of exile.Brenda has analyzed the metal fragments and discovered them to be extremely unusual. She makes a date with Connor and they plan to meet at her apartment. Although she tries to make it seem like it's only a date, she actually is trying to entrap him: she has a cassette recorder hidden in a drawer and also has a gun just in case. However, when Connor arrives he's immediately on to her and calls her out on this. Brenda insists that she only wants to know what's going on and that the shards of metal from Connor's sword date back several thousand years, but he tells her to stop digging and leaves.In 1541, Connor has settled in Glencoe, where he works as a blacksmith and is married to a woman named Heather (Beatie Edney). One day they are visited by a well dressed older gentleman (Sean Connery) carrying the katana that Connor uses in the modern era. The man identifies himself as Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez. He explains that they differ from normal men: they do not age, are immune to disease, and will only die if their heads are separated from their bodies. He proves this by knocking Connor (who cannot swim) off a rowboat. Connor does not drown, and actually marvels at some aquatic scenery before bobbing back to surface, seething with confusion and anger. He tries to attack Ramirez with this highland sword but fails; Ramirez simply tells him that they are ready to begin.While training Connor in the finer points of swordsmanship, Ramirez explains a long cycle he refers to as ""the Game,"" where immortals are compelled by an incomprehensible force to hunt each other down. When one immortal decapitates another, the winner receives a transfer of power called ""the Quickening."" The Game is destined to continue until only a few immortals remain, triggering ""the Gathering"", where the survivors feel an irresistible pull towards a far away land and fight until only one remains. The last immortal standing will receive the cumulative sum of every Quickening, which Ramirez cryptically refers to as ""the Prize."" Discussion soon turns toward the Kurgan, who is revealed to be the oldest and strongest of the immortals, descended from an ancient barbaric tribe from Kievan Rus, in the steppes of Russia. He must not achieve the Prize or mortals will be enslaved forever. Connor also learns that all immortals are sterile, and fears how Heather will react when she learns he cannot give her any children. Ramirez reveals that he has been married three times and his third wife, a Japanese princess named Shikiku (the daughter of the man who made Ramirez's katana), was the love of his life. Eventually, Shikiku died of old age, and he was devastated. He urges Connor to let Heather go, and foreswear future mortal relationships, to avoid the same heartbreak. Connor refuses.One night while Connor is away, the Kurgan arrives, demanding to know where ""the Highlander"" is. Ramirez lies, telling him that he has already killed Connor. The Kurgan sees through the deception and attacks. A fierce battle ensues. Ramirez gets an early advantage, slashing deep into the Kurgan's throat (revealing how Kruger got the scar on his neck and how his voice was altered) and wounding him in the side. However, the Kurgan's rage and ferocity eventually tip the battle in his favor. He asks who Heather is and Ramirez again lies, saying she is his woman so that his enemy won't use her against Connor. He decapitates Ramirez and receives the Quickening. After it has surged through his body, he falls from the tower where he and Ramirez had battled. Heather approaches him, thinking he's dead, but he grabs her.After the death of his mentor, Connor attempts to return to a normal life, but as Ramirez warned, Heather succumbs to old age while Connor remains youthful. On her deathbed, she thanks Connor for staying with her until the end, and ask that he honor her memory by lighting a candle on her birthday. After burying Heather, Connor plants his Scottish broadsword in the ground to mark her grave, appropriating Ramirez's katana as his weapon. He destroys all traces of his old life and leaves Scotland.Connor meets an exotic-looking man named Sunda Kastagir (Hugh Quarshie) in present-day Central Park at the Bow Bridge. It becomes apparent they are long-time friends as well as immortals. They talk about how few of them are left and say the time for the final battle is close. They also discuss the possibility that they might have to kill each other.Connor and Kastagir recall meeting in Boston circa 1783. Connor is about to duel a very snooty man and is so drunk he can hardly stand up, but he still attempts to fight. The other man easily defeats Connor by stabbing him, and quickly declares himself the victor. However, Connor gets up and wants to continue the fight. The man is stunned but resumes the fight, easily stabbing Connor again. A humorous situation ensues where the man repeatedly ""kills"" Connor and each time Connor gets back on his feet until he finally apologizes for insulting the man's wife.After much investigation Brenda finds out that Connor should be dead -- Russell Nash is the name of a baby who died at birth. She confronts Rachel and in a flashback we learn that Connor rescued her from the Nazis when she was a child. Rachel tries to keep Brenda away, but eventually Connor explains to Brenda who he really is. He proves it to her by stabbing himself in the stomach. After this revelation Brenda and Connor become lovers, although Connor is reluctant, and the ghostly voice of Ramirez suggests that he let her go.Elsewhere in the city, Kirk, a gung-ho ex-Marine with survivalist tendencies, sees Kruger and Kastagir dueling in an alley. Kruger kills Kastagir and receives his Quickening. Kirk, clearly freaked out by witnessing this event, shoots Kruger, who shrugs off the injury and impales him. Kirk survives, and gives the police Kruger's description. In response, Kruger alters his appearance by shaving his head and covering the scar on his neck with a safety-pin necklace.Connor is at a church, lighting a candle for Heather's birthday. Kruger enters, revealing that Kastagir is dead and he and Connor are now the only immortals left. Kruger taunts Connor by telling him of his defeat of Ramirez and about raping Ramirez's wife. He then realizes that Heather was actually Connor's wife and had never told him about the rape. Connor is furious, but is reminded of the immortals' oldest rule: they cannot fight on holy ground. Kruger finds out that Connor is having an affair with Brenda and kidnaps her in order to draw Connor into the final fight. Connor accepts the challenge and kisses Rachel goodbye, telling her that Russell Nash dies tonight, and that she knew this day would come.The two fighters meet on the roof of Silvercup Studios and an epic sword fight begins. Kruger tries to use Brenda to defeat Connor by tying her to a the studio's massive rooftop sign, but Connor manages to save her. The fight causes major destruction. Both fighters fall into a large warehouse which is surrounded by windows. After a climactic fight Connor defeats Kruger and experiences the sum of all quickenings, which destroys every window in the warehouse. The police assume that Kruger is the headhunter serial killer they were looking for, and that Nash was his final victim.The last scene shows Connor and Brenda in the Highlands and it explains that the Prize gives Connor awareness of the thoughts of all people all around the world and allows him to exert some influence. As a result he can help people cooperate with one another. He is now also mortal, able to have children and grow old. Ramirez tells Connor that he now has power beyond anyone's imagination, and urges him to use it well."

At the same time, they must defend themselves against an all-out attack from the Decepticons. The Decepticons have invaded and taken over the Autobots' home planet, Cybertron. The Autobots are determined to fight back and go to Autobot City on Earth for supplies. Decepticons hijack and take over the ship, resulting in a fierce battle between the Autobots and Decepticons, the result of which is devastating. A new threat to the Autobots appears in the form of Unicron, a massive planet-devouring transformer.—grantss This theatrical movie based on the television series (which was also based on a popular multiform robot toyline) did not go over very well at the box office. The movie takes place in 2005, twenty years after the television series, and chronicles the efforts of the heroic Autobots to defend their homeworld Cybertron from the evil Decepticons. Both factions are seething with anger, and that hatred has blinded them to a hideous menace headed their way. That hideous menace is the colossal planet known as Unicron, who has been ready to consume anything that stands in its way. The only thing that can stop Unicron is the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, which is possessed by the Autobots and which the Decepticons, through Unicron's orders, plan to take away from them.—Christopher E. Meadows <cmeadows@nyx.cs.du.edu> It is the year 2005. The battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons has escalated through their homeworld Cybertron, which the Decepticons have conquered. Without Optimus Prime after a conflict on Earth takes his life, the Autobots must face a destiny which they know nothing about. Megatron and a group of forsaken Decepticons have been reformed by the ultimate transformer, a planet consuming demon known as Unicron into even deadlier warriors. Galvatron, Scourge and Cyclonus must destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership for Unicron's glory or suffer the horrific destruction of Cybertron. However, Optimus Prime has decreed that an Autobot will rise from his rank and use the power of the Matrix to light the darkest hour of the Autobots. With Hot Rod facing responsibility for Prime's death, he feels he may be able to use the power of the Matrix to turn the tide of the Cybertronian Wars and stop Unicron. Until all are one, the future of the Autobots and the Decepticons is uncertain.—Geoffrey A. Middleton <gamidd01@morehead-st.edu> Unicron, a mechanical planet that devours other worlds, approaches the planet Lithone. The mechanoid inhabitants on the planet watch helplessly in horror as their planet is destroyed and ingested by Unicron. Only one ship, with a sole passenger, Kranix, escapes the death of his world. Newly fueled thanks to the resources from Lithone, Unicron turns and heads towards its next prey: Cybertron.In the year 2005, the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons has culminated in the Decepticons conquering their homeworld Cybertron, while the Autobots operate from its two moons preparing a counter-offensive. Optimus Prime sends an Autobot shuttle on a fuel transport voyage to Autobot City on Earth. Thanks to recon data from Laserbeak, the Decepticons intercept the Autobot shuttle and kill most of the Autobots aboard. They sneak past the early warning systems that protect Earth and lead an attack on Autobot City. Many Autobots are killed during this battle. The Autobots inside Autobot City send a distress signal to the Autobot moon bases, hoping that reinforcements will arrive in time.Reinforcements arrive, led by Optimus Prime, who sends the Dinobots in first to stop the Constructicon giant, Devastator, while Optimus prepares to stop Megatron. Optimus Prime and Megatron square off against each other. Megatron is critically wounded in the fight. Optimus Prime dies, but not before passing the Matrix to city commander Ultra Magnus. The Decepticons flee Autobot City after Megatron and several other critical Decepticon warriors are injured or killed. As they travel back to Cybertron, Starscream takes this opportunity to throw Megatron and the wounded Decepticons into deep space to die. He then proceeds to take command of the Decepticons.As Megatron and his fallen minions helplessly drift through space, Unicron pulls them toward him. Unicron would rebuild Megatron and his troops, once Megatron would destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, which has the power to destroy him. After haggling with Unicron, Megatron accepts and was reborn as Galvatron. Unicron places a pain inducing circuit in Megatron's brain, where it could not be removed to keep him under control. Skywarp, Thundercracker, and many Insecticon clones were formed into Cyclonus, Scourge, and the Sweeps.Galvatron arrives on Cybertron just in time to see Starscream being crowned leader of the Decepticons. Galvatron quickly dispatches the usurper to his throne and gains the servitude of all Decepticons present. Soon afterward, Unicron arrives to Cybertron and devours two of its moons and everyone inhabiting them. Galvatron leads another attack on Autobot City. This forces Ultra Magnus and several other Autobots, namely Arcee, Springer, Blurr, Perceptor, Hot Rod, Kup and the Dinobots to lead the Decepticons away in two shuttles. Hot Rod, Kup and the Dinobots are shot down and crash on Quintessa. Ultra Magnus fools Galvatron into thinking that he had destroyed the Matrix, but Unicron knows better. Magnus and his crew crash-land on the Planet of Junk. Unicron informs Galvatron of Magnus and the Matrix's whereabouts, and Galvatron quickly pursues him.Meanwhile on Quintessa, Hot Rod and Kup, separated from the Dinobots, are captured and taken to be put on trial before the Quintesson imperial magistrate in a mock trial and real execution for the Quintesson's amusement. They watched as Kranix, the last survivor of Lithone is fed to the Quintesson's executioners, the Sharkticons. The castaway Autobot Wheelie witnesses Hot Rod's and Kup's capture and seeks out the Dinobots to rescue the imprisoned Autobots. Hot Rod and Kup fight valiantly against the hordes of voracious Sharkticons, but the sheer numbers soon overwhelm them. Just as they were being buried beneath the mob of Sharkticons, the Dinobots kick down the door and trample Quintesson and Sharkticon alike. Grimlock then turns the Sharkticons, who fear and revere his strength, against the Quintessons. Wheelie shows the Autobots where a Quintesson spacecraft can be found.Back on the Planet of Junk, Galvatron destroys the Autobot shuttle. The Sweeps blow up Ultra Magnus, and Galvatron takes the Matrix. He plans on using the Matrix to control Unicron. As the Decepticons leave, the remaining Autobots are attacked by the Junkions, mechanoids indigenous to the Planet of Junk. As the Junkions, who perceive the Autobots as thieves and trespassers, are closing in for the kill, the Quintesson ship with Hot Rod, Kup, Wheelie and the Dinobots arrives. Hot Rod greets the Junkions properly and they soon form an alliance. The Junkions rebuild Ultra Magnus, and inform them that Galvatron left for Unicron with the Matrix. The two groups, Autobot and Junkion both leave to battle Galvatron and his master Unicron and to regain the Matrix.Upon reaching Unicron, Galvatron confronts and threatens Unicron with the Matrix. Unfortunately for Galvatron, he cannot open the Matrix to use against Unicron. Unicron is furious with Galvatron for this treachery. Unicron transforms into a gigantic robot mode. Unicron attacks Cybertron to punish Galvatron. The Decepticons counter-attack without success. Unicron swallows Galvatron, after Galvatron fires upon him.The Autobots and Junkions arrive and join the battle. Hot Rod flies the Quintesson ship through one of Unicron's eyes. The Autobots bail out of the crashing ship. Hot Rod is separated from the group and stumbles upon Galvatron and the Matrix. Galvatron proposes a truce in ordered to fight Unicron, their common foe, but Unicron uses his torture implant to force Galvatron to destroy Hot Rod. As they fight, Galvatron prepares to crush Hot Rod with his bare hands. Hot Rod grasps the Matrix and divine light breaks forth. Optimus Prime's voice speaks from the Matrix ""Arise, Rodimus Prime"", and Hot Rod is transformed into the new leader of the Autobots, with increased size, wisdom and strength. Rodimus Prime easily defeats Galvatron and throws him through the walls of Unicron, sending the Decepticon tumbling through space. Rodimus then unleashes the power of the Matrix inside of Unicron. Rodimus evacuates the Autobots trapped within Unicron by bursting through Unicron's remaining eye, as the Matrix's power shreds the monster planet from the inside out. As his body explodes, Unicron's head is ejected into orbit around Cybertron, replacing the moons he devoured with an eyeless gaze and a shocked expression upon his face.The Decepticons fled Cybertron as their attacks on Unicron proved ineffective, leaving the empty planet for the Autobots to retake virtually without resistance. The new leader of the Autobots declares an end to the Great War and a new age of peace."
The Hitcher,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091209/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young man who escapes the clutches of a murderous hitchhiker is subsequently stalked by the hitcher and framed for his crimes. A young man transporting a car to another state is stalked along the road by a cunning and relentless serial killer who eventually frames the driver for a string of murders. Chased by Police and shadowed by the killer, the driver's only help comes from a truck stop waitress.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> Driving someone else's car from Chicago, Illinois to San Diego, California, a young man named Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) picks up a hitchhiker with a taste for murder. The Police, unaware of the real murderer (John Ryder (Rutger Hauer)), blame Jim. Ryder shows super human powers in his destructive spree.—Rob Hartill Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell), a young man delivering a car from Chicago to San Diego, spots a man hitchhiking and gives him a ride. The man, giving his name as John Ryder (Rutger Hauer), is a brooding, soft spoken man; when Jim passes a stranded car, however, Ryder's personality suddenly shifts. Ryder calmly states that the reason the car is stranded is because he murdered and mutilated the driver, and he intends to do the same to Jim. Ryder produces a switchblade knife and taunts Jim for several moments, before Jim realizes Ryder never put on his seat belt and that the passenger door isn't fully closed and knocks him out of the car.Relieved, Jim continues on his journey, until a station wagon carrying a family on vacation passes, and Jim is horrified to see that Ryder has hitched a ride with them. Jim attempts to signal the family, but ends up nearly totaling his car; when he finally catches up to the station wagon, Jim discovers the entire family has been horribly mutilated by Ryder.The movie shifts into an elongated chase sequence, which finds Jim trying to flee Ryder both on foot and in his car, to no avail; wherever Jim runs, Ryder finds him: It seems that Ryder, impressed with Jim's show of bravery by knocking him out of the car, has decided that Jim is the man who is finally going to put his killing spree to an end.Jim then finds Ryder at an abandoned gas station. Ryder knocks down the gas pumps with a pickup truck and then lights a match. Both cars drive off and the gas station explodes. Jim retreats to a roadside diner, where he meets a pretty young waitress named Nash (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and calls the police. She then serves him a cheeseburger and french fries. He eats these in solitude, until discovering that one of the fries is a severed finger. Realizing that Ryder is nearby, Jim attempts to flee, but is stopped by the police who promptly place him under arrest, mistakenly thinking that he might be responsible for the dead bodies found by the side of the road. At some point, Ryder pick-pocketed Jim, and placed his wallet at the scene of a murder. Jim is taken to a local jail, booked, and placed in a cell.Sometime later in the day, Jim awakens from a nap to find the police station eerily quiet and his cell door open. Jim slips out to discover the bodies of three murdered policemen. Jim panics, steals a gun and runs from the station house as five police cars arrive.Jim comes to a pay phone and sees two cops pull up. Knowing that Ryder has framed him, Jim points his gun at them and takes the troopers hostage, forcing them to drive him away from the scene. He forces the police officers to get him in touch with the captain, and Jim pleads his case. The captain suspects that Jim is telling the truth, and asks Jim to come meet him. Jim agrees, but just then, Ryder pulls up alongside the car, kills the cops with a revolver, shoots out the radio, and drives away.Jim wanders across the desert to a diner and is confronted by Ryder. When Jim asks Ryder why he's pursuing him, Ryder only replies that Jim should know, then calmly reaches across the table and sticks two pennies over Jim's eyes (an ancient funeral ritual performed on corpses, so that their souls could pay Charon to carry them across Styx to the land of the dead). Jim is left terrified and alone with the pennies on his eyes - and a handful of bullets that Ryder left him for his gun. Jim attempted to shoot Ryder, but only to find that his gun has no bullets.Jim leaves the diner and sneaks onto a Greyhound bus. He then sees that Nash is on the Greyhound. He pulls Nash into the bus's bathroom and convinces her that he's innocent.Before the two can act, the police stop the bus and attempt to arrest Jim. But the hot-tempered Trooper Hancock (Henry Darrow) means to kill Jim because one of the policemen murdered by Ryder was his brother. Nash takes Jim's gun and pulls it on the two officers, and she and Jim flee in a police car. They're chased by two more police cars and Jim is forced to blow out their tires and cause them to collide with one another. Then a police chopper arrives and starts taking pot shots at Jim. Then Ryder pulls up, shoots the chopper down and drives away.The pair hide out in a roadside motel, but while Jim is taking a shower, Ryder breaks into the room and kidnaps Nash, dragging her to a truck stop parking lot where he ties her between a Mack truck and its trailer, threatening to tear her in half if he doesn't speak to Jim. The police, now convinced of Jim's innocence, enlist him to try to negotiate with Ryder. In the cab of the truck, Ryder demands that Jim shoot him. Jim refuses, saying that if he were to shoot Ryder, Ryder's foot will slip from the clutch, killing Nash anyway. Furious, Ryder insults Jim and then shifts both the clutch and the accelerator - the truck screams forward, killing Nash. Police swarm the truck and arrest both Ryder and Jim.At the station, the authorities are bewildered, unable to find any information on Ryder: He has no social security number, no driver's license, no indication that he has ever existed. All that the police can determine is that Ryder is a serial/spree killer and a threat which the local department cannot handle, and arrange to have him transported for holding at a state prison. Before Ryder is placed into a transport van, the police allow Jim to see him in the interrogation room. Ryder seems pleased to see Jim and touches his hand. Jim responds by spitting in Ryder's face.The police cover Ryder in shackles and chains and place him in the back of a prison bus, escorted by multiple officers. As Jim is loaded into a police car to be taken to his family, he finally decides to murder Ryder. Jim steals Captain Esteridge's gun and hijacks the squad car, chasing the prison bus. As Jim pulls up on it, the back doors fly open, to reveal the entire police escort murdered and a bloody, still partially chained Ryder clutching a shotgun. As the van veers out of control, Ryder leaps off the back of the van and crashes through the window of the police car Jim is driving. Jim slams on the brakes, throwing Ryder off; the sudden braking, though, causes the police car to stall, and a bloody Ryder lifts himself from the highway, picks up his shotgun, and begins firing it into the police car.Jim avoids the damage of the blasts by lying sideways, repeatedly turning the ignition key and pumping the gas pedal in an effort to restart the car; he eventually restarts the car, and slams it into Ryder, throwing him off the side of the highway. Jim slips out of the car, picks up the still-loaded shotgun, and inspects Ryder's corpse. Satisfied that Ryder is dead, he turns around and heads back to the police car when he hears movement behind him. As he stops, Jim is not surprised that Ryder is alive and standing up. Ryder smiles at Jim and throws his shackles down at Jim's feet. Jim responds by emptying the remaining shotgun shells into Ryder's body, at last killing him, and leaving Jim alone in the desert to light up a cigarette and watch the sun set over the horizon."

Mona Lisa,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091538/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man recently released from prison manages to get a job driving a call girl from customer to customer. After getting out of prison, George (Bob Hoskins) looks for a job, but his time in prison has reduced his stature in the criminal underworld. The only job he can find is to be a driver for beautiful, high-priced call girl Simone (Cathy Tyson), with whom he forms an at first grudging, and then a real, affection. But Simone's playing a dangerous game, and when George agrees to help her, they both end up in deep trouble with Mortwell (Sir Michael Caine), the local kingpin.—Kathy Li After serving seven years in prison, the small-time criminal George is released. He seeks out his daughter, but his ex-wife does not let him talk to her. His friend Thomas meets him and gives back his Jaguar that he kept for him, and explains the new reality when George is impressed with how the neighborhood has changed. George is hired by his former boss Mortwell to work as the driver and bodyguard of high-class call girl Simone. In the beginning George is a misfit for the position, and does not get along with Simone, but gradually he befriends her--and falls in unrequited love with her. Simone looks for someone on the streets of the King's Cross district (London's red-light district in the 1980s) and asks George to help her to find the prostitute Cathy. George is involved with the underworld of prostitution and is chased by the dangerous pimp Anderson. When he finds Cathy, he discovers how Simone is connected to her.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil George is fresh out of prison. Because he has not betrayed his clients or his cronies from before, he thinks they owe him something. His ex-wife wants nothing more to do with him and keeps their daughter away from him. He finds accommodation in the garage of his friend Thomas and gets a job as a chauffeur in the company of his former boss Mortwell. Mortwell is a big player in the local red-light scene and gives George the job of driving the high-class call girl Simone from one john to the next. Simone, with her manners trained on fine customers, and the straight-laced, somewhat plain George first have to get along. But slowly George gets to know and appreciate the person behind the role of the high-class prostitute. Simone takes advantage of George's affection to hire him for a job: For a long time Simone has been looking for her missing friend Cathy, who has slipped into even darker corners of prostitution because of her drug addiction. George asks around on the streets and finds out that his boss Mortwell has something to do with Cathy's disappearance. When he finds Cathy, he is finally caught in the mobsters' crosshairs. George has just been released from prison, and manages to get a job driving an expensive call girl from customer to customer. Initially they don't get along, and he doesn't fit in with the high class customers Simone services. Will they ever get along?—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> Under the opening titles, we see a man crossing a bridge in London carrying a package. He stops off at a florist and picks up a bouquet. When he arrives at his destination, a rowhouse in a lower-class neighborhood, he knocks on the door. A teenage girl in a school uniform answers the door, but the encounter is swiftly interrupted by her mother, who comes out shouting and cursing at him. He responds in kind, and by the time she's closed the door on him for good, a crowd has formed in the street. The man nearly gets into a fight with one of the neighbors, but another man pulls him out of the whole thing.
The man's name is George, played by Bob Hoskins. The teenager is his daughter Jeannie, played by Zoe Nathenson, and the man who rescued him from the fight is his best friend Thomas, played by Robbie Coltrane. Thomas has been keeping in touch with George, largely through sending him mystery novels. George complains that in some of them it's far too easy to figure out who the murderer is, and often posits alternate, better solutions to the stories. We learn over time that George is a low-level gangster who has been in jail for seven years, and it's likely that he went up because he took the heat for someone else's deeds. That ""someone else"" is Denny Mortwell, a big-league player in the local prostitution scene, and he's played by Michael Caine. Because George took that heat, however, he thinks that Denny owes him something, so he spends some time looking for Denny, but apparently he's out of the country at the moment. However, he's given a job to do by one of his capos. He's to be the driver and bodyguard for what we can only assume is a very high-priced call girl named Simone, played by Cathy Tyson. Simone is very hostile to George at first, and it may be because he's rather uncouth and outspoken, and he's hostile to her because he thinks she's putting on airs. She gives him money to get a decent outfit, and the clothes he picks out are no better than the ones he had on previously. Later on they go out shopping for something more suitable. We see a friendship start to grow between the two, but it's still somehow guarded on her side. Occasionally, between jobs, she has him drive to King's Cross, which is one of those areas where the hookers openly solicit customers. As they drive through, she appears to be looking for something, but she doesn't say what. At one point George notes that a couple of the girls are his daughter's age, and when one girl approaches him and he turns her down, she begins to abuse him verbally until her pimp shows up. From his car seat, George beats up the pimp and they drive off.
Later, in her apartment, Simone tells him why they keep going down to King's Cross. In her past, she was one of the girls down there. She had a pimp named Anderson, who would beat her regularly. She had a single friend down there, a young girl named Cathy, who also worked for Anderson. She'd promised to take care of Cathy, but at one point she took the opportunity to escape. She ran away to Brighton and discovered a whole other level of clientele. When she returned to London she realized that these bigger fish also existed there, so she began working on her own, though Denny was finding the clients for her. But she's haunted by the fact that she left Cathy behind and keeps looking for her, knowing that the lifespan of a girl at King's Cross is likely to be limited, especially when they're working for a guy like Anderson. She enlists George's help to find Cathy, reasoning that he'd have an easier time moving through that part of town.
George meets up with Denny and Denny gives him a little lecture on the nature of happiness. He then says that what makes him happy are the small details in life. To that end, he wants George to find out what Simone does when she's with her clients, presumably as a means of blackmailing them or otherwise using the information as leverage.
In between all of this, George has occasional encounters with his daughter Jeannie, by picking her up at school and driving around a little bit, talking with her before dropping her off near her home. Jeannie has no idea why George disappeared for seven years, but she's eager to have him back in her life. George keeps drawing mental parallels between Cathy, who's about Jeannie's age, and Jeannie, and thinks about what could have happened while he was away. And in the meantime, he's increasingly torn between his loyalty to Denny and his affection for Simone. At one point he literally asks her what she does with a client, and she tells him that they drink tea and do nothing else. To underscore the lie, she has someone take a couple of Polaroid pictures of her serving out tea and has them sent to George while he's waiting for her. When George reports back to Denny that she's having tea and actually has photographic proof, Denny gets furious at him and tells him to get his head back in the game.
Now, in between his chauffeuring jobs, George also delivers packages for Denny to various places in the red-light district, so he's been looking for Cathy on the sly. At one point he thinks he's getting close to her but it turns out to be another teenager who bears a superficial resemblance to Cathy. George tries to ""rescue"" her but is unsuccessful. On another delivery trip, he spots a porno tape and tries to buy it, but the owner just gives it to him. When he gets an opportunity, he plays the tape and his suspicions were right: it's Simone in the video, giving oral sex to a man. George confronts Simone about the video and she confirms that the man in the video is Anderson. He's played by Clarke Peters.
Anderson tracks Simone down to her apartment, and tries to slash her, cutting George's arm instead. They manage to get away from him and he stashes her in Thomas' place, which is basically a secluded garage where he works on cars and deals in buying and selling various knickknacks. Because Thomas can get stuff, George asks him if he can procure a gun.
George then goes out and locates Cathy at Denny's house. He takes advantage of a hidden door to sneak her away from her client, but she's badly addled by heroin. It's clear that she's deeply addicted to the stuff. He takes both girls to a hotel in Brighton, and Cathy is in the early stages of withdrawal. Simone sends George to a pharmacy for some drugs to help Cathy, and he gives her the gun, just in case.
Later on, he and Simone go for a walk on the boardwalk. Early on, they get into an argument but he finally gets the whole story out of her: Simone and Cathy aren't just good friends, they're lovers. Suddenly Simone spots Anderson nearby on the boardwalk and the chase is on. Eventually George manages to get away from both Anderson and his henchman, but they know where everyone is staying, so he knows that they won't be safe for long. In fact, it's not long after they get back to the hotel that the gangsters catch up with them. A fight ensues and Simone winds up shooting both of them dead, but then in the heat of the moment she points the gun at George. George is infuriated and strikes her, then takes the gun and leaves.
Sometime later we see George, who's now basically free of his obligations to whatever remains of Denny's organization, and Thomas working together under a car, when we see a pair of female feet walk up. It turns out to be Jeannie, who's still rebuilding her life with her father. The two of them walk out of the garage, chatting happily."

Jean de Florette,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091288/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A greedy landowner and his backward nephew conspire to block the only water source for an adjoining property in order to bankrupt the owner and force him to sell. In a rural French village an old man and his only remaining relative cast their covetous eyes on an adjoining vacant property. They need its spring water for growing their flowers, so are dismayed to hear the man who has inherited it is moving in. They block up the spring and watch as their new neighbour tries to keep his crops watered from wells far afield through the hot summer. Though they see his desperate efforts are breaking his health and his wife and daughter's hearts they think only of getting the water.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} In a hilltop-perched village of verdant 1920s Provence, César Soubeyran, the wealthy patriarch of a dying family, and his only living relative, his nephew named Ugolin, are willing to lose their souls to perpetuate the proud bloodline of the Soubeyrans. With this in mind, the two farmers concoct a foolproof plan, and without an ounce of shame, they rob their romantic next-door neighbour, Jean Cadoret, a city dweller suffering from severe kyphosis, of his unknown treasure: a blocked, long-forgotten spring in his property. Now, deprived of precious water during a long and notably dry French summer, Jean and his family, his supportive wife, Aimée, and young daughter, Manon, have to work twice as hard to fulfil their noble aspiration, as the methodical duo systematically destroys their future, watching Jean fail from afar. Will things work out in the end for Jean de Florette?—Nick Riganas The film ""Jean de Florette"" (1986) and the one which followed it, ""Manon des Sources"" (1986), are the screen rendition of Marcel Pagnol's exquisite novel, ""L'eau des Collines"" (""The Water from the Hills,"" 1963). It is the story of two competing projects, one carried out by the city-dweller Jean Cadoret, and the other by the peasant Ugolin, set in the rustic and picturesque environment of Provence in the 1920s. It is a story of opposites: the city versus the country, modernity versus traditional, good versus bad, and memory versus oblivion.As ""Jean de Florette"" begins, Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), also known as ""Galinette,"" having fulfilled his compulsory military duty, returns to ""les Bastides Blanches,"" his native village. His uncle is César Soubeyran (Yves Montand), ""le Papet,"" who with Ugolin is the last of the Soubeyrans, the most powerful family in the village. ""Le Papet,"" having never married (a bit of a misnomer, since ""papet"" means ""grandfather"" in Provençal), has no heirs to whom he can pass his fortune. He sees in Ugolin his only hope for continuing the Soubeyran lineage.Ugolin returned to ""les Bastides"" with the idea of growing carnations. He sets up a small plot of land, plants his cuttings, and waits for the results. Ugolin keeps his enterprise a secret until the first harvest, when he takes his uncle along to witness the sale of the flowers to the village florist. Impressed by Ugolin's success, César sees in it a way to secure the Soubeyran family's fortune, and he resolves to do everything possible to facilitate Ugolin's success. The enterprise needs more land, and since carnations require lot of water to grow, this land must have a reliable source of water. Nearby, at the domain known as ""les Romarins,"" there is a spring whose existence has almost been forgotten. César and Ugolin know of its existence, and they go to speak to the owner of the land, Pique-Bouffigue, offering to buy his property. Pique-Bouffigue is antagonistic toward César (probably because César never married his sister, Florette) and insults him. A fight ensues, during which César unintentionally causes Pique-Bouffigue's death. The two Soubeyrans arrange his body at the foot of a tree to simulate an accidental fall.César writes to an old school chum, Grafignette, who lives in nearby Crespin, asking to whom he should now address his offer to purchase ""les Romarins."" Grafignette writes back that the Pique-Bouffigue's heir is named Jean Cadoret (Gerard Depardieu). Cadoret is the son of Pique-Bouffigue's sister, Florette, who had just passed away few days earlier. Realizing that ""les Romarins"" would be practically uncultivable without the nearly forgotten spring, César and Ugolin plug it up with cement, and then camouflage it. Furthermore, César makes sure that the rest of the village knows that Jean Cadoret comes from the hated village of Crespin, thereby guaranteeing the silence and complicity of the few villagers who could be aware of the existence of this spring.Jean, ""le bossu"" (the hunchback), his wife Aimée (Elisabeth Depardieu), and his young daughter, Manon (Ernestine Mazurowna) soon arrive at ""les Romarins,"" planning to settle down and raise rabbits. ""I'm here to cultivate the authentic!"" he tells Ugolin, who interprets the word ""othentic"" as some sort of exotic vegetable. Jean's project is in direct competition with César 's for the precious, scarce resources of arable land and water. César is convinced that it is only matter of time until Jean, a city dweller, will fail, sell his property, and return to the city where he was employed in the tax collector's office. He advises Ugolin to befriend Jean, to help him and his family as much as possible in their venture, thus insuring that when Jean is finally desperate enough to sell out, it will be to his true friend and good neighbor, Ugolin.The Cadorets spend their first winter at ""les Romarins"" preparing their project, and the spring heralds their success: the rabbits are growing fat and multiplying, and the kitchen garden gives produce which are the envy of the Soubeyrans. Summer is another story: no rain. Jean's well is now dry, and he, together with Aimee and Manon, must fetch the life-giving water from a spring located more than one mile away, still on the Cadorets' property, at ""le Plantier."" They endlessly shuttle between their garden and the spring as many as five or six times per day. Despite his efforts, Jean cannot keep up with his garden's thirst, and he collapses exhausted: all the rabbits die, and the garden is burned by the implacable Provence sun.Once restored to health, Jean is not ready to give up, and mortgages his property to César. Jean reads in one of his books about the dowsing technique and proceeds to use it to look for a spring on his land. Thinking he has discovered one, Jean digs until he reaches bedrock, and then dynamites the rock. He is injured in the explosion, and dies on his kitchen table. Aimée sells the property to César and prepares to depart. César and Ugolin, not even waiting until Aimée and Manon have left, rush to the hidden spring and unplug it. Manon, who had followed them, is crushed by the spectacle of the gushing water: her beloved father died just as a spring was ""discovered"" on the property.César cups some water from the spring and pouring it over Ugolin's head declares him the ""King of Carnations."""

A monitor in the general's office indicates that the bomb has successfully destroyed the Mars rocket.It is here that General Wilson finally believes David's claim about aliens and speculates that the aliens are from the nearby planet Mars and when they observed the SETI rocket under construction and bound for Mars, the aliens misinterpreted it as an attack on their planet and so they decided to strike first by landing on Earth to destroy the rocket before it could be launched. General Wilson asks David to show him the sandpit at Copper Hill, and orders his soldiers to surround the area, but Sargent Rinaldi (Eric Pierpoint), the general's aide, loses his footing and the sandpit swallows him.Two aliens stand near the cave, eyeing advancing soldiers and Dr. Mark Weinstein (Bud Court), a member of SETI. Weinstein wants to converse with the aliens before the military launches an attack. He returns an alien mechanical part, believing the aliens understand him. Nevertheless, the scientist is vaporized by the alien's ray gun, and the soldiers kill the aliens.David runs into the sandpit hoping to locate his parents, and Linda follows. Both are swallowed up, and the general sends soldiers after them. They lay down explosives and rappel into the hole left by the explosion.Inside a lab at the alien spaceship, David observes as a device is implanted in Sgt. Rinaldi's neck to control humans. Mrs. McKeltch orders other aliens to capture David and Linda. David pleads with the Martian Supreme Being to release his parents, arguing that mind control is wrong, and predicting the aliens' failure in conquering Earth. The head Martian comments that David is ""a poor little guy,"" and the boy punches him in the nose. As he runs away, David knocks over Mrs. McKeltch, who falls into the gaping mouth of an alien and is eaten alive.In the tunnel, realizing Sgt. Rinaldi is under the control of the Martians, the general orders his men to shoot him dead.David leads the soldiers back to the spaceship to destroy the Martian Supreme Being and save Linda from receiving an implant. Many soldiers are vaporized, but American firepower causes the Martian Supreme Being to retreat into a protective eye-shaped shell. As Linda is saved, soldiers plant explosives, and the general orders a five-minute delay to escape before detonation.Upon discovering that the escape route is blocked, David sacrifices a mint copper penny his father gave him to activate an alien weapon that is left behind since the metal copper is the source of the alien's technology. Meanwhile, the wounded Martian Supreme Being orders the aliens to prepare the ship for takeoff.The soldiers escape through the new opening, but David hears his parents calling. He refuses their entreaties to join them on the spaceship, and while he struggles against them near the ridge, the spaceship explodes in the sky. The implants in his parent's necks are apparently deactivated, but the aerial fireball begins to overtake and consume both David and his parents....Suddenly, David awakens in his bedroom. His parents comfort him, and he is relieved to find nothing implanted in his father's neck. The entire Martian invasion and battle was apparently nothing more than David's nightmare. His mother tucks him into bed and reminds him that dreams are not real and tells him goodnight. But sometime later, a thunderstorm snaps him awake. When he opens his window, David sees the exact same Martian UFO spaceship landing on Copper Hill. He runs to his parents' room in a panic. David's nightmare is starting again.... or is it?"

In an attempt of resocialisation, five hopeless juvenile criminals, J.L., a silent boy with 80s fashion sense who murdered his abusive father, Ruben, a Latino gangbanger, Moss, a African American gangbanger and Ruben's mortal enemy, Dorcey, an illiterate runaway car thief, and Carlos, a Cuban refugee turned slick yuppie drug dealer, are sent away from prison into the Everglades for a survival training under Vietnam war veteran, ""Indian Joe"" Tegra. When this is successful, they move back to Miami slums. However this offends the former illegal inhabitants of the rundown two story house they settle in, all loyal customers of drug baron Cream. The conflict escalates into a bloody gunfight, but what the boys don't know is that Cream is just a henchman for the merciless Miami drug lord Nestor, who also has Carlos' girl Nikki with him.—Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> Trained by the military, a war hero takes on the task of reforming 5 youths damaged beyond hope. Using military and basic survival skills, he breaks gang and racial barriers that the youth value and creates family values that bring the youth together and fight the mean streets of Miami. Five young teenage criminals are arrested in and around Miami, Florida, and sent to Youth Hall to serve their sentences. They make up of two rival gang leaders, Ruben Pacecho (Michael Carmine), the Hispanic leader of the Home Boys serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault and armed robbery; Moss Roosevelt (Leon Robinson), the African-American leader of the 27th Avenue Players also serving a three-year sentence for assault and armed robbery; Carlos Aragon (Danny Quinn), a suave drug trafficker serving a four-year sentence after being arrested in a police sting; James Lee ""J.L."" McEwen (John Cameron Mitchell), a violent punk serving a 10-year sentence for manslaughter of his abusive and alcoholic father and various arson charges, and finally Dorcey Jon Bridger (Al Shannon), a car thief serving three-plus years for various auto theft and over 15 escape attempts from various juvenile halls.At the juvenile prison, Ruben, J.L., Carlos, Moss and Dorcey taunt each other as they are transferred and released in the middle of the Everglades, where a group leader named 'Indian Joe' Tigre (Stephen Lang) makes them fend for themselves until the following morning. When Joe returns, he starts a fire, and shares some of the fish he caught. The five inmates demand to know what is happening. Joe informs them that the law has decided to treat them as adults because of their criminal records and the seriousness of their crimes, but the juveniles refuse to learn survival skills. Later, as rain drenches the group, Moss Roosevelt attacks Joe, but fails to take him hostage.Joe teaches the teenagers to use citronella oil to prevent mosquito bites, and how to build a bed from reeds growing in the swamp. Moss steals Dorcey's bed, but later Dorcey sets a trap that leaves Moss hanging upside down.Back in town, Carlos Aragon's girlfriend, Nikki (Lauren Holly), visits drug lord Nestor Quintana (James Remar) to ask if he knows where to find Carlos. Nestor assures Nikki that he will locate Carlos in exchange for sexual favors. As Nestor inhales cocaine, he orders Nikki to take off her clothes in his bedroom.Back in the Everglades, Joe and the group scavenge for food, and soon, a wild boar chases after them. They climb trees to avoid being attacked, and Joe stabs the boar with a spear. They surround and kill the animal, roast it over an open fire, and eat the meat for dinner. Afterward, Joe announces it is exam time. He gives them a map with a destination, and a compass, then leaves.The next day the group sets off in a boat Joe has left them. Moss and Ruben Pacheco get into a fistfight after Ruben drops the compass in the swamp. Dorcey urges them to stop wasting time, and work together. Later, on land, when Moss falls in dense brush, Ruben helps him. After another day and evening in the swamp, they think they are lost, until they hear music. The sound leads them to an outdoor party with people, food, and drink. They see Joe, and he tells them that they are the first group to ever survive the rigors of the Everglades, and announces that their program continues in Miami.Joe and the five teen criminals move into an abandoned halfway house in ""Little Havana"" that Joe purchased from the city for one dollar. In the process, they evict junkies occupying the property, but allow Haitian squatters to remain. Soon, a drug lord named Cream (Laurence Fishburne) drives by the house in a white Rolls Royce convertible to see the reason for the commotion on his turf.Later, Carlos finds Nikki living in an expensive apartment. She claims that a friend lent her the place, but when Carlos does not believe her, she reveals she is working for Nestor. He accuses her of sleeping with Nestor and leaves. Nikki follows him to the apartment building lobby, and Nestor appears. He orders Nikki to his side, and tells Carlos to get lost.Back at the group house, Moss and Ruben prevent their respective former gangs from beating each other, then persuade the local Cubans to help paint the property.One day, Joe and the group are playing basketball when Cream arrives and accuses Joe of muscling in on his turf. Joe pretends to surrender, then overpowers Cream and presses his face against the sidewalk. On Joe's command, Cream's men relinquish their weapons. As the group collects the firearms, Cream vows revenge and leaves with his entourage.Later, the teenagers cannot resist playing with Cream's arsenal and pretending to be big shots. Joe warns them that guns are not toys. He reveals that previous members of his program returned to the streets and fell to drugs and guns. He wants to clean up the neighborhood, and break Cream's dominance. He says it is his mission alone, but his charges agree to help. Joe teaches them teamwork and combat technique.At a meeting, Cream assures Nestor he will destroy the halfway house. Nestor is not convinced, and threatens Cream so that he will carry out his plan. Back at the halfway house, Carlos tells Joe he is leaving in order to reunite with Nikki.Later, Nikki tells Carlos she has saved $10,000, and convinces him to leave Miami. While they are driving, Nikki tells Carlos that she overheard Cream's plan to destroy the halfway house. Carlos turns the car around and heads to Little Havana. Outside the halfway house, a gun battle rages between Joe, the youths, and Cream's gang. As the gunfight winds down, both Cream and Joe are killed. The group realizes that Nestor is the man behind Joe's death, and vow to destroy him.Nestor is busy building three new cocaine-manufacturing plants in Miami, but gives his associate the order to kill Nikki. He does not see Joe's youths as a threat. Carlos, J. L., Ruben, Moss, and Dorcey follow Nestor's men to a compound in the Everglades. The youths devise a plan to blow up Nestor's heavily guarded warehouse. First, they distract guard dogs with a female dog in heat. Dorcey sets off a bomb made with gopher gas, while the others attack. A climatic gun battle commences between the teenagers and Nestor's guards, while a mini-gun turret on the roof sprays machine-gun fire. When Nestor sees Nikki hiding in the shadows, he throws down his gun, and walks toward her. When he reaches for her gun, she shoots him dead. Elsewhere, Dorcey explodes a series of bombs that destroy Nestor's operation.As they drive away, Ruben comments that Joe should have been there in their moment of victory. When their car is stopped at a police checkpoint, they play dumb, and ask what is going on. The officer says he does not know, and after a few questions, he tells them to go easy on the beer, and lets them continue their journey. The five person group, now known as the 'Band of the Hand'; Ruben, Moss, J.L., Carlos, and Dorcey, along with Nikki, drive away into the night to an unknown future."

John feels the need to tell his friends what he did, and in small groups they go down to the clearing to ascertain that he's telling the truth. Another person who knows about the murder is Matt's equally-delinquent 12-year-old brother Tim, who might be even more dangerous than the teens as he does anything to get what he wants, namely weed, and to honor what he sees as the code, not understanding the consequences. Despite Jamie being their friend, no one says anything to the authorities; they feel almost paralyzed because their unofficial leader Layne wants to protect John by getting rid of Jamie's body. The police eventually do find out about the murder, and Layne hides John, using his older ""friend"" Feckler--who generally supplies them with free weed and allegedly killed a young woman when he was about their age--while others try to find out who told the police. While some may want revenge against ""the snitch"", the actions of the collective demonstrate how detached they are about their friend Jamie's death.—Huggo The movie opens with a boy, Tim (Joshua Miller) playing on a bridge. He hears a yell, and sees Samson/John (Daniel Roebuck) sitting on the shore. The boy pedals off, and Samson smokes a cigarette by the naked corpse of Jamie (Danyi Deats).

Manon of the Spring,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091480/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A beautiful but shy shepherdess plots vengeance on the men whose greedy conspiracy to acquire her father's land caused his death years earlier. After the death of Jean Cadoret, his wife has returned to the life of opera singer and his daughter Manon has grown up and become a gorgeous lonely shepherdess. Ugolin is now a thirty year-old wealthy bachelor planting carnations. His grandfather Cesar Soubeyran presses him to get married to carry the name of their family since he is the last man alive. When Ugolin sees Manon on the fields, he falls in love with her. One day, Manon plots revenge against Ugolin and Cesar and the whole town is in despair.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Roaming the rich valleys and the verdurous pastures of 1930s Provence, proud shepherdess, Manon, the beautiful eighteen-year-old daughter of late Jean Cadoret, is still reeling from the sudden death of her father. Unable to come to terms with the irreparable injustice, ten painful years after the events ofJean de Florette (1986), unsuspecting, golden-haired Manon catches the eye of the repulsive, prosperous flower cultivator, Ugolin, who, without an ounce of shame, summons up the courage to declare his love for her. However, the once-fertile soil of the wronged Romarins has a memory, and more than anything in the world, Manon thirsts for revenge. They say the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children. How many more must suffer for Ugolin's blood-red carnations?—Nick Riganas The film ""Manon des Sources"" (1986), together with ""Jean de Florette"" (1986), which PRECEDES IT, are the screen rendition of Marcel Pagnol's exquisite novel, ""L'eau des Collines"" (""The Water from the Hills,"" 1963). It is the story of two competing projects, one carried out by the city-dweller Jean Cadoret, and the other by the peasant Ugolin, set in the rustic and picturesque environment of Provence in the 1920s. It is a story of opposites: the city versus the country, modernity versus traditional, good versus bad, and memory versus oblivion.""Manon des Sources,"" takes place some ten years after ""Jean de Florette"", also in the village of ""les Bastides"" and the surrounding hills. Ugolin's carnation-growing business is prospering, as inferred when he sells his flowers to a retailer who complains about their high prices. Manon (Emmanuelle Béart) is now a beautiful, wild shepherdess, spending her time in the hills and valleys of the area, tending her flock of goats. She totally ignores ""les Bastides,"" and the villagers aware of her presence, reciprocate, calling her ""la sauvageonne"" - the wild child. She lives with her mother and Baptistine (Margarita Lozano), at ""le Plantier."" A new character is introduced, the new village school teacher, Bernard Olivier (Hippolyte Girardot) who is also an amateur mineralogist.One day while hunting in the hills, Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), comes across Manon who is dancing nude, playing a tune on her father's harmonica. This is the proverbial love-at-first-sight. Too shy to approach Manon directly, he continues to spy on her, following her in the hills. He sets traps to capture birds and rabbits, which he then places in her traps as gifts. From then on, Ugolin is obsessed with Manon. César Soubeyran (Yves Montand), ""le Papet,"", who had been pushing a reluctant Ugolin to marry in order to continue the Soubeyran line, is thrilled when Ugolin finally confesses, although in a rather unusual manner, his matrimonial intentions. Ugolin decides to ""move in"" and propose to Manon in a most clumsy and outrageous manner. She is repulsed by ""the toad"" and runs away from him (Actually, in real life, Daniel Auteuil was briefly married to Emmanuelle Béart).Sometime later, Manon overhears two hunters from ""les Bastides,"" Pamphile (André Dupon) and Cabridan (Pierre-Jean Rippert) discussing how Ugolin had plugged the spring on her father's property, and the fact that everybody in the village knew of the existence of that spring and kept quiet about it. Manon runs away, crying and screaming: she is crushed, and she swears to take revenge on Ugolin, César , and the whole village. Her opportunity arrives when she discovers a cave containing the source of the spring which supplies the water to Ugolin's property and to the village's square's fountain. She blocks the course of the spring: this is an unmitigated catastrophe for the whole village.At first, Ugolin fetches the needed water for his flowers from the spring at ""le Plantier,"" the way poor Jean used to do, but this is only a makeshift solution. Without the spring's flow, his carnation business is doomed, as will be the whole village. The village council summons a Government expert who basically tells them that they are on their own.The following Sunday, the church is packed for the high Mass. The priest (Jean Bouchaud) tells the congregation that this disaster is God's response to a criminal act perpetrated by one among them. He calls for a procession to bring the spring back to life. Following the Mass, the entire village gathers in the school yard to celebrate Bernard's birthday.At this gathering, Manon publicly accuses Ugolin and César of having plugged the spring. Her accusation is backed up by Eliacin (Didier Pain), who had been a witness to the bad deed. Although admitting to no wrongdoing, Ugolin totally breaks down and falls to his knees, imploring Manon to marry him. Many of the assembled villagers confess their treachery, as César drags a crushed Ugolin out of the assembly and back to his house.Sometime later, César summons the mayor, Philoxène (Armand Meffre), and Belloiseau (Lucien Damiani), to ""les Romarins,"" where they find Ugolin hanging from a tree, the same tree where young Manon's swing used to hang.Bernard, invoking the memory of her father, convinces Manon to unplug the spring. The two set out in the middle of the night to free the water. The next day, as the priest's procession is taking place, the water starts flowing again from the village fountain. ""Miracle!"" some shout, but for Philoxene and others, it is mere coincidence.Bernard and Manon get married, and soon she is with child.An ancient village resident, the old, blind Delphine (Yvonne Gamy) returns to ""les Bastides."" She often meets with César in front of the church at dusk. During one of these meetings, Delphine recalls to César a certain letter that Florette had sent to him while he was in the army. This scene is the most heart-wrenching that one could imagine. Following Delphine's revelation, César loses all will to live, and one evening, after having confessed to the priest, he takes to his bed, and dies peacefully."

Paul Stephens, a high school student in Ithaca, New York, is generally unmotivated academically despite being a science geek, his interest, as per his age, mostly in those science items that have a wow factor. It is his interest in science that connects him to Dr. John Mathewson, a scientist recently having relocated to Ithaca and who is interested romantically in Paul's soon to be divorced mother, Elizabeth Stephens. It is in that want to impress Elizabeth through Paul that John invites Paul to Medatomics, a medical research facility, so that he can demonstrate some of those ""wow"" type experiments on which he and his colleagues are working. While impressed enough, Paul is nonetheless more interested in something else in the facility that John only makes passing reference to when asked, that ""green goo"" which in combination with other things Paul discovers around the facility making him believe that the facility really a secret government nuclear one, the green goo radioactive material for atomic bombs. Paul and his classmate/girlfriend Jenny Anderman, an aspiring journalist, want to expose Medatomics for what they believe it to be as there was no community notification about operating a potentially dangerous nuclear facility there. While Jenny wants to go the traditional route in writing an exposé, Paul believes there is only one effective way to get their message across to the world while making them both famous. The further Paul, with Jenny's help, gets to enacting his plan to its intended end, the more he may place their lives and that of the community in danger, especially if the authorities discover what he is doing.—Huggo The Manhattan Project tells of how 17 year-old Paul Stephens (Christopher Collet) and his girlfriend Jenny Anderman (Cynthia Nixon) an aspiring journalist, wants to alert their community a secret nuclear facility in their hometown of Ithaca, NY.

While Dr Mathewson is visiting Paul and Jenny steal the plutonium and construct their own atomic bomb for a science fair in New York city. The movie is funny, and at times, frightening, showing how what can really happen if a teenage genius, finding all things possible on the internet, in published books, and unclassified government papers, can really build himself a nuclear bomb, all for a first place or first prize in a science fair."

During what is a midterm election year, Pete has among his clients: Washington Governor Andrea Stannard who is being attacked by her main opponent for her personal home situation rather than her politics; wealthy New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Wallace Furman, whose main obstacles to an election night win are not being a native New Mexican and having little personal charisma; and Roberto Cepeda, a Presidential candidate in a strife and violence-ridden but oil-rich South American country.

'Round Midnight,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090557/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A troubled, but talented musician flees the US to escape his problems, finding refuge and support in Paris. In 'Round Midnight, real-life jazz legend Dexter Gordon brilliantly portrays the fictional tenor sax player Dale Turner, a musician slowly losing the battle with alcoholism, estranged from his family, and hanging on by a thread in the 1950's New York jazz world. Dale gets an offer to play in Paris, where, like many other black American musicians at the time, he enjoys a respect for his humanity that is not based upon the color of his skin. A Parisian man who is obsessed with Turner's music befriends him and attempts to save Turner from himself. Although for Dale the damage is already done, his poignant relationship with the man and his young daughter re-kindles his spirit and his music as the end draws near.—Siddy DeRosser It's worth pointing out that 'Round Midnight was based loosely on the life of Francis Paudras, a friend of many jazz luminaries. Among those who took up residence with him were Bud Powell and Bill Evans. He was also the author and compiler of the tome, To Bird With Love. The 11 CD collection of Bud Powell that he put out (almost all recorded in his home) gives us a glimpse of Bud like never before. He took his own life at 62 in his castle in Antigny, after an illness, and a most interesting life.—Fred Crane Foreshadowing in black and white. It's night. Dale Turner (Dexter Gordon), in what looks like a cheap hotel room, is standing with his back to the camera, looking out at the city lights. Voice from off-screen: 'Is it in the same room where Hershell died?' Dale replies: 'I don't know, Francis. The same raggedy drapes. Crummy wallpaper. They all look the same. All I remember...it was a Friday...the last time I saw Hershell.'New York City, 1959. From black and white to color. Hershell (Hart Leroy Bibbs) is lying in bed in the same hotel room. Dale and Hershell reminisce about playing jazz together. Dale tells Hershell he's going to Paris that night. 'No cold eyes in Paris.'Voice over: 'If you'd seen Dale and Hershell play together, Francis, its something you'd never forget. It was so new and so different, and yet so close. Maybe it was all those memories that made Dale leave for Paris that Friday morning. Maybe what he saw in Hershell's eyes was too frightening and too familiar.'Dale arrives in Paris. Buttercup (Sandra Reaves-Phillips)-friend and de facto business manager--takes him to his hotel room. In the hallway, Dale is stopped by Ace (Bobby Hutcherson), a vibraphone player who spends his days in his bathrobe, cooking. Ace waits until Buttercup is out of sight and says: ""I got a little something for you.' And slips a small bottle into Dale's jacket. 'Better than Harlem!' In his room, Dale drinks straight from the bottle, then throws up. There's a knock on the door and he hides the bottle behind the sink. Buttercup tells him to get some rest. He's going to have to play tonight. Later that day, the bottle is empty.At the Blue Note nightclub that night the piano player, Eddie Wayne (Herbie Hancock) welcomes Dale to the band and to the audience. Band members rise as Dale walks onstage with his tenor saxophone. They play 'As Time Goes By'. Madame Queen (Liliane Rovère), the night club owner, observes Dale is sitting down as he plays and says: 'At least he could stand when he plays.' Ben (John Berry), the club manager, replies, 'He could be on his back and he'd still be great.' The tune ends to rousing applause. Later, at the bar, Dale extends his glass to the bartender but is ignored. 'I must be invisible in here'. Buttercup comes in and collects Dale's money from Madame Queen. She gives Dale a peck on the cheek.Outside the Blue Note, in a driving rain, Francis (François Cluzet) is stooped down, listening to the band through a cellar-level window. A passer-by asks for money. Francis angrily pushes him away. If he had five francs he'd be inside. The band finishes its set and Francis is exhilarated with what he's heard. Back at his apartment, Francis' daughter, Berangere (Gabrielle Haker), is waiting up for him. Annoyed, he instructs her to go to sleep, then sits on the side of the bed next to her: 'He played like a god, that Dale Turner.'Dale is back in his room. Buttercup enters and Dale asks fir a new reed (mouthpiece for his sax). She replies, 'Can't you blow through, everybody else does,' then, 'Well, I'll get it, 'cause you been good.'At the Blue Note, Dale is at the bar after a set. He asks for a drink. The answer is 'no'. Outside, Dale spots Francis in the shadows of a bar across the street, and goes over. 'Hey man, can you buy me a beer?' Francis buys him a beer. He tells Dale that when he was in the army he wanted to hear Dale's music so much he went 'over the wall' and got ten days in jail.' Dale replies: 'You got enough dough for another beer?' Dale invites Francis into the Blue Note and introduces him as 'an old jail buddy of mine.' Francis enjoys a front row seat. The band finishes for the night and the members are paid, except for Dale. Ben pays Buttercup Dale's money. Francis notices Dale's humiliation.Another night at the Blue Note. Francis is watching Dale onstage. Dale dabs at his face as a tear rolls down his cheek. Back in his apartment, Dale tells the story of his time in the army-all Negro unit; all 'pink' officers. One day 'this captain' found a photo of his wife who was lighter-skinned and much prettier than his. The officer made a 'funny' remark, and he, Dale, hit him over the head. Ended up in the cowpoke stockade, where the officers played 'drum paradiddles on my head...for some time...Yeah, I got lucky. I found this Jewish doctor from New York. Wow. Without him it would have been a catastrophe. He got me out of the army...Bebop was invented by the cats who did get out of the army...'Francis, a struggling artist and filmmaker, is experiencing problems with his client, and with Berangere's mother.One night, newspaper in hand, Francis delivers devastating news to the band. 'Hershell died last night.' Later, Dale is in an alley near the Blue Note, playing. He confesses he can't play the tune, can't remember the words to 'Autumn in New York'. Francis sings the words to him. Dale plays the tune later that night. Francis is in the audience. Berangere is at home alone, watery eyed, and looks at a photograph--of her mother, Francis, and herself, smiling at the camera.Ben offers Dale a coke, which he says is a 'free' rum and coke, for being superb. Later, Dale asks an American fan for five dollars, and disappears. Francis looks for him. A young woman finds Dale passed out on the street. Francis arrives at the police station just as Dale is being put into a paddy wagon. Francis screams at the police to let him go. A struggle ensues and Francis is restrained. The police eventually release Dale, and Francis takes him home in a taxi. 'You're not right! Shit! You're Dale Turner! You play too good for this shit!'
Back at his hotel, Buttercup and Francis takes Dale back up to his room. Buttercup: ""What am I gonna do with you? Just like a baby. Gotta watch you every single minute.' When Buttercup leaves, Francis demands Dale have dinner at his apartment the following night. Eight o'clock.Dale is at Francis' place for dinner. Francis adds water to the wine, which Dale notices later in the evening. As Berangere is clearing the table, Dale says: 'You act like my little girl.'Francis walks Dale to his hotel and when he returns home, Bebop is playing loudly on the gramophone. As he enters, Berangere cowers on her bed as if bracing for a blow. Francis sits on the bed next to her. She gets up to turn the gramophone off, but he takes her hand and holds her close.Back at the Blue Note. The band finishes their set. Dale pockets the tip left by a couple at a nearby table, and goes to the bar across the street. He orders two red wines. Later that night Francis hunts him down at a hospital. Not trusting Dale to be on his own, he returns to the apartment he shares with Berangere, and puts Dale to sleep in his bed. He pours two bottles of wine down the sink. The following morning he asks Berangere not go to school and to watch Dale instead.Francis meets Berangere's mother, Sylvie (Christine Pascal) , in a restaurant. He needs '8,000' for key money. He and Berangere need a larger place. 'Dale Turner is living with us!..I want him to compose again. He's terrific. If I'm anything today, its on account of guys like him. I'm working twice as hard: I'll do anything for him. Nobody inspires me like him. I want the greatest sax player to live decently.' Sylvie replies. 'For us three the apartment was always fine...I never inspired you?' 'Will you lend it, yes or no?' 'No.' Francis screams at her, pounds the table, and storms out of the restaurant.Dale is at Francis' apartment with a new reed. Berangere is with him. The doorbell rings. An envelope for Francis. As Dale begins to play, Berangere opens the envelope. A check for 300,000 francs made out to Francis from Sylvie. Berangere reseals the envelope and leaves it on a table.Francis and Dale are checking out of Dale's hotel room. Buttercup intersects them. 'Checking out without saying goodbye, huh?' Dale asks for his passport.Francis' new apartment. Dale's voice over gives a summary of the evolution of jazz from Swing to Bebop. Swing bands were 'straight timing', seventh chords. Then with the Basie band, there was Lester Young, sounded like he came out of the blue, was playing the color tones--sixths, ninths, major sevenths, like W.C.. Then Charlie Parker came along and experimented with elevenths and thirteenths, and flat fives. 'I was going in the same direction.' You just don't go out and pick a style off a tree. The tree is inside you, growing naturally.Back at the Blue Note. Dale has disappeared again. Madame Queen to says Francis, 'Tell him it's the last time.' Francis searches for Dale. The next morning, he's at a hospital and asks a nurse about a black American, Dale Turner. He's told there's no Dale Turner there. A young black woman, cleaning the floors, overhears the conversation. She runs after Francis as he leaves the building, and tells him where he can find his friend-in the same hospital complex, but at another building.Francis finds Dale being interviewed by a psychiatrist. He opens the doorway a crack and listens. Dale says he's tired. He can sleep, but there are the 'dreams.' Dreams about music-playing the saxophone, sound, expanding the music, more, and more. There have been nights where he's been working and playing, and at the end of the night he looks at his mouthpiece, and its all bloody. But he hasn't felt a thing. 'My life is music. My love is music. And its twenty-four hours a day. Do you understand?'In the taxi afterwards, Francis tells Dale that he was listening to his conversation with the psychiatrist. Dale asks: 'Was I good?' and smiles.Night. Dale is brought to Francis' home, drunk again. Francis puts him to bed. On the verge of tears, he looks at his idol, then looks away. From his bed, Dale peaks at his friend who is clearly in emotional pain. The following morning, Francis is sleeping. Dale brings him breakfast. 'Never again, man. Don't cry for me.' 'What else can I do. You're killing yourself.' Dale again promises to stop drinking. Francis says: 'You never stopped before.' 'I never promised anybody before.'At the Blue Note, Dale sips a glass of water. Francis is in the audience with Berangere sitting on his lap. For the first time, Dale stands as he plays.One of Francis' works-a poster for a film-is accepted by his client, and will be used all throughout Europe.Dale asks for a few francs to go get some cigarettes. He heads out and Francis follows from a distance. Dale sits at an outside table at a café and orders orange juice and some Pall Malls. Francis observes, unnoticed, from across the street, and smiles.Dale, Francis, Ben and Buttercup are at the Blue Note. Dale demands he be paid directly, like the other musicians. No more money to Buttercup. Ben says, that's not the deal they made with Goodley. Dale replies, either he is paid directly that night or he won't be back tomorrow. Ben replies he'll have to talk to Madame Queen.Dale is playing standing up. Later that night he returns to Francis' apartment, and waves a wad of francs. 'Tomorrow, a new wallet.' Francis replies: 'A big one!' The next day, Dale serves beef steak he purchased and prepared for Francis and Berangere.A 'light-skinned,' pretty, black woman appears at the apartment: 'Hello, Long Tall.' Dale replies, ' I dreamt you were coming to Paris.' She kisses him on the lips. Darcey Leigh (Lonette McKee) joins the band on stage that evening and sings 'How Long Has this Been Going On?' At dinner, Darcey and Dale reminisce about old times. Darcey: I always thought we'd keep each other company. Dale: We have. Darcey holds his hand and bites her lip, and says: Dale, do you have any regrets? Dale: Only one...I had big eyes to play with Count Basie's band. But he told me one band leader in the band was enough. Darcey: Maybe it was for the better, huh?Francis, Berangere and Dale are at the beach. Berangere finds a toy phone. Francis hands it to Dale 'It's for you.' Dale takes the receiver: 'Yeah, I can't come. I'm having too much fun' and hangs up. Its Birdland, he says, they wanted him to come back.Dale and the band are at a recording session. Francis is watching as the musicians prepare. Sylvie appears. Francis repays some of the money she's loaned him. Sylvie says she'd like to have Berangere back for a bit. Francis agrees and invites her to listen in as the band records. As Sylvie follows Francis to the engineer's booth, she and Dale make eye contact for the first time-a straight, emotionless exchange. 'Does he still inspire you?' she asks Francis. Francis is effusive about the recording session. He sits down and is transfixed by the music. Sylvie quietly slips away. As she's about to leave the building, Francis calls: 'Sylvie.'Francis, Berangere and Dale visit Francis' parents (Pierre Trabaud, Frédérique Meininger) for Berangere's birthday party. Berangere blows out the candles on her cake. They pass Dale a slice, but he is deep in thought, his mind far, far away. Later, walking along the Seine, Dale compliments Francis on his family--they seem to like to live in harmony--then he adds. 'Yeah, Lady Francis. I think it's about time for me to go home.'From the Seine to the East River. Francis accompanies Dale to New York. R.W. Goodley (Martin Scorsese) meets them at the airport and takes them to their hotel. He enquires about Buttercup. 'Buttercup is great. I tell ya, Buttercup is great!' Like Buttercup in Paris, Goodley has made all arrangements for Dale. From instant coffee and peanut butter ('I know you like that') to paying for all of Dale's expenses. 'And whatever comes to you, you don't have to worry about it, it comes to my office at the end of the week.' He offers Dale an advance. Dale gestures to Francis. Goodley throws the money on the bed next to Francis. After Goodley leaves, Dale says; 'S.O.S. Same old shit.'Francis leaves to check out the club. In the hallway he notices two guys quickly exchange a handful of cash for something that's cleverly hidden. One of the guys looks at Francis and walks away.Dale and the band at the club. Dale's daughter, Chan (Victoria Gabrielle Platt), arrives and is given a table at the front with Francis. Dale plays a tune he wrote for her. After the show Dale and Chan are at a late-night diner. Francis sits at another table. One of the guys in the hallway deal appears. Dale acknowledges him: his name is Booker (Arthur French). Booker compliments Dale's playing and leaves. Francis looks worried.Francis is back at the hotel. Booker is waiting outside Dale's room. He wants to see Dale. There's a brief struggle and Booker pulls a switchblade. When a hotel guest appears, he folds and pockets it. He walks away and says, over his shoulder: 'Tell Dale Booker was here. He wants something...he'll find it.'Back at the hotel room. Dale is sitting at the window, looking at the city lights. Francis asks if he was happy in Paris, then says: ""Is this the same room where Hershel died?' 'I don't know. They all look the same.'Under the East River's Williamsburg Bridge, Francis tells Dale that he's going back to Paris. He's made two reservations. For tomorrow. There are two flights, at 7:30 and 9:30. Dale replies: 'If we're going, let's go early. Y'know, Lady Francis. There's not enough kindness in the world.' The following evening, Francis is waiting at the airport. He waits until the final boarding call. He returns to Paris. Alone.In Paris, Francis awakes with a start, sits bolt upright. His face glistening with sweat. He gets out of bed and sits in the living room. Hours later he's sitting in the same chair, staring at the walls. There are footsteps in the hallway. A letter appears under the door: 'Dale died Friday at Cumberland hospital - Goodley.' Berangere appears and Francis embraces her.Francis is with Berangere looking at black and white footage of Dale. Dale says: ""I hope, Lady Francis, we live long enough to see an avenue named after Charlie Parker; Lester Young Park; Duke Ellington Square; and even a street named Dale Turner.'Years later, in an open air venue in front of a large crowd, Eddie Wayne and a large band open a concert with one of Dale's compositions, a tribute to their friend-- 'a great jazz musician' who was always doing things 'ahead of us'--Dale Turner."

As Gloria and Glendon ask journalist Willie Tuttle about the significance of The Phoenix, Justin Kronk interrupts and, once again, announces that he has information for a price. Glendon and Gloria are annoyed by his arrogance and leave, only to be questioned by Joe Go, who claims the clue makes no sense and leaves.Gloria and Glendon part, but back at the hotel, Willie and Kronk reveal that Mei Gan is a grave robber who plundered China Doll's illustrious family vault. Faraday recovered China Doll's family treasures, setting up Mei Gan's desire for revenge. Soon, China Doll gives Gloria and Glendon precious jewels they can use to purchase opium. Although Joe Go tries to rescue them, Mei Gan and his men chase Gloria and Glendon until they are trapped at the waterfront.

When he hands the belt to Mei Gan, a delayed timer sets off an explosive that kills the corrupt officer.Joe Go remarks that it is a shame the jewels were destroyed but Glendon claims that they are safe. He retrieves them from a hiding place in a rowboat tied to the dock. Before Gloria can rejoice, Joe Go steals them and runs away. Gloria and Glendon chase after him, and knock his bodyguard unconscious.

With a few strategic moves, Faraday, who has been disguised as Mr. Burns, parts Willie from his gun and sends the would-be thieves tumbling down stairs. Faraday explains that he was rescued from death by a fisherman's net, recuperated for a year in Osaka, Japan, and plotted his return. He needed help to recover the jewels after China Doll refused to return them, and picked Glendon because he resembled China Doll's former lover. Walter Faraday points a gun and demands that Glendon hand over the ticket to Los Angeles. Before he escapes, Faraday imprisons Gloria and Glendon in separate wicker trunks. Gloria and Glendon thrust themselves down the staircase, and are set free by the real Mr. Burns, who has just returned from Peking, China. They find Faraday aboard a ship, and intend to reclaim the jewels, but Faraday announces the gems are fakes, and China Doll has tricked them all. Faraday offers to share his cabin so that they can return to America. However, Gloria decides to stay in Shanghai, while Faraday boasts that he will make Glendon rich. Glendon decides that his future is with Gloria. He orders a crewman to return Faraday's three wicker trunks to the dock.As the ship sails away, Glendon reunites with Gloria, while Faraday waves and stomps furiously on deck once he discovers his trunks are missing. On the dock, Glendon opens a wicker trunk and discovers opium hidden beneath his supply of glow-in-the-dark neckties."

But they aren't what they seem. A French anthropologist gets murdered in Los Angeles after discovering the existence of ancient demonic spirits, first described in old Inuit legends, that can take human form and prank, possess or even kill people. Before he dies, he reveals this secret to a young female doctor who quickly realizes that his wife is now in danger as well.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> In Los Angeles, a man with numerous injuries is hospitalized. Before he dies, he reveals his secret to Dr. Eileen Flax. It turns out that the man was Charles Pommier, an anthropologist scholar of African and Inuit nomadic groups and their myths. As if possessed by Pommier's memories, Eileen relives his last day of life in a prolonged terrifying flashback and discovers that he was obsessively following a bunch of strange demonic street punks just before he died. She also realizes that his wife is in mortal danger as well.—Anonymous French anthropologist Jean Charles Pommier dies in an emergency room after being terrorized by something. However, Dr. Eileen Flax, who tried to save him, suddenly receives his memories by psychic means, and relieves his last few days in a long flashback. It turns out that Pommier had just recently moved to L.A. with his wife Niki after years of researching African and Inuit nomadic groups, their way of life and their myths.Pommier soon notices a group of street punks and metalheads who apparently live in a black van and frequently hang around his house, especially at night, because a brutal murder of a family had been committed there recently, and this seems to attract them. Pommier becomes fascinated by this group due to their resemblance to a nomadic tribe, and starts following them as well as investigating the murder. It quickly becomes clear that these are no ordinary urban nomads and Pommier soon becomes afraid both for his and his wife's lives, but also their souls. However, Pommier decides that he's in too deep and continues his investigation despite a friendly warning from the ghost of a nun he mistakes for a hallucination.Eventually, Pommier realizes, although too late, that the punks are actually evil spirits and demonic tricksters from ancient Inuit legends that still exist in modern day societies disguised as roaming humans that no one pays attention to. They are attracted by death and violence because they feed on human fear but also human souls. Unfortunately, once the punks realize he knows their secret, they will try to kill him, take his soul and make him one of them. Pommier tries to find a way out of this horrific situation, but to no avail. In desperation, he even confronts one of the punks on top of a skyscraper and during their brawl throws him from it. However, the punk simply taunts him and disappears.In the end, the punks succeed in killing him but not before he's able to transfer his knowledge to Dr. Flax with implied request that she helps his wife escape from the demonic punks. Flax contacts his grieving wife who at first doesn't believe her, but when the punks surround her house, break in, trash the place and corner the two women in the attic while taunting them, Niki realizes in terror it's all true and she and Flax make a run for their lives after the punks eventually retreat for some reason.However, a masked motorcycle rider in black begins trailing their escape vehicle, which terrifies distraught Niki even further, but Flax insists that they drive as fast as they can and do not look back, no matter what. As soon as they make it across the California state limit, the masked biker, who's apparently magically bound by the state's boundary and, unlike the women, can not cross it, stops. The rider lifts his goggles and, as they look back, the two women realize in shock and horror that it's Pommier, now seemingly just another of the demonic spirits that pursue them. However, it seems like he still possesses some knowledge of his former identity, as he emotionlessly but curiously and possibly even melancholically watches as the two women drive away. He then coldly turns his bike around and drives off, presumingly back to L.A. to join the demonic pack of urban nomads he himself now belongs to, possibly forever."

Despite some comforting words, the State Department has no idea where the girl is, which leaves her desperate family out of options. However, Grandpa Winston suggests that they should turn to pulp heroes like Remo Williams (a.k.a. The Destroyer), Mack Bolan (a.k.a. The Executioner) or Jake Speed (a character made-up for the movie) for help. Everyone believes it's just dementia talking until Margaret's best friend Wendy visits her the next day and finds a message addressed to Margaret under the door.

Margaret buys this and agrees to travel there with Jake and Desmond. However, once there, she's attacked, almost blown up and almost sold into slavery by Jake, all as part of his plan which he neglected to explain to her. She eventually begins to suspect that there's something wrong with Jake and his friend and runs away. She finds her way to a consulate that's being evacuated due to heavy fighting. The consul explains that Jake and his friend are two infamous benign fraudsters, who actually believe that they are two pulp fiction heroes.

In private, he confides to his father, widowed businessman and retired Navy officer Frank Jones, that part of his want to leave the job, which also entails eavesdropping on private conversations between Soviet officials on a multitude of everyday topics, is that he believes the British, and by association Americans, are just as corrupt as the Russians in how they infiltrate institutions most of the public see as commonplace, this belief to which conservative, patriotic Frank takes offense. After a specific incident, Bob wants to use that whistle blowing policy to report against the operations of the GCHQ, but not knowing to whom. Shortly thereafter, Frank learns that Bob has died from an apparent fall off of his building roof. Frank begins to think that Bob's death was not an accident, but has something to do with whatever Bob was planning on exposing. Knowing no one in high places, Frank, with Bob's girlfriend Cynthia Goodburn helping, goes on a mission of discovery, at his own peril, to find out why his son was killed, which may forever change his view of what he has believed in all his life.—Huggo"

The two privileged white teenagers talk about a coming revolution, and act as if Bigger is in collusion with them. They browbeat him into taking them to Ernie's Kitchen Shack in the black section of town, where the black staff and clientele are dismayed by the presence of white people, and Bigger is embarrassed.

Bigger places a pillow over Mary's face to quiet her until her blind mother leaves, but when he removes the pillow, Mary is dead.

Though Peggy cannot find Mary in her room, she tells Bigger to drive her trunk to the station, and then he can take the day off. Bigger returns to his neighborhood and visits Bessie's apartment. She is angry that he ignored her at Ernie's, and hints at her fears about his angry outbursts.Later, at the Dalton house, Peggy instructs Bigger to retrieve the trunk he left at the station because Mary never arrived in Detroit.

Britton asks Bigger when he took Mary to school, then smashes a piece of wood against his chair when he fails to speak up. Bigger confesses that Mary ordered him to drive to the Labor Defenders office on Lake Street to pick up her boyfriend Jan. After driving around, they got drunk at a place on the South Side and Bigger took them home around 2:00 a.m.Later, the detective brings Jan Erlone to Bigger's room.

After the others leave, Bigger gets his pistol and walks to the station, but Jan stops him on the way and asks what Dalton and Britton said to make Bigger turn against him. Bigger draws his gun and tells Jan to leave him alone.Bigger runs to Bessie's apartment and prints a ransom note to let the Daltons know Mary is safe. Bigger slides the note under the Daltons' front door. Peggy finds the note and gives it to Mr. Dalton, who gathers several reporters in the basement for a press conference. Peggy informs Bigger he needs to clean the furnace because the house is getting cold, but when he opens the furnace, it is choked from ashes and smoke pours out. The reporters find bones and an earring inside, and Bigger flees the house.On the street, he hears radio reports that police are combing the South Side for a Negro ""rapist"" and murderer. Fleeing to a rooftop, Bigger is trapped by vigilantes, knocked off a water tower by a fireman's hose, and thrown in jail. After several days, Jan Erlone visits Bigger's cell and asks why he killed Mary. Bigger refuses to speak. Jan admits having no idea how socially ""far apart"" they were when he and Mary forced themselves on him. Jan introduces Bigger to Max (John Karlen), an attorney friend from the pro-Marxist Labor Defenders who wants to represent him in court. Then, the racist assistant district attorney Buckley (David Rasche) enters the cell to tell Bigger he has enough evidence to put him in ""a dozen electric chairs.""At the court inquest, the Daltons ask Bigger to confess who helped him kill Mary. Mama Thomas arrives where she gives Bigger a crucifix and begs him to ""go to God."" She humiliates Bigger by kneeling and pleading with the Daltons to stop the law from killing her boy. Buckley tries to soften Bigger by telling him he knows how it feels to be a ""colored man"" cut off from society, but when the assistant district attorney mentions rape, Bigger yells that he did not rape Mary. Bigger insists that Jan had nothing to do with killing Mary or writing the ransom note. At night, a lynch mob of white men outside Bigger's jail burn a cross and scream racial slurs.The next morning, Max enters Bigger's cell and asks about the murder, Bigger explains that Mary's death was an accident and he did not rape her. However, he admits to hating the rich young woman because she presumed to be his friend. Max tries to explain that Mary was naive and innocent. Max explains that all Bigger had to do was let Mrs. Dalton know at the time that he was bringing Mary to her room, but Bigger claims he was ""dead"" the moment he stepped into that room.During the trial, the district attorney tries to implicate Jan by saying his Communist pamphlets inspired Bigger to rape and kill Mary. In her testimony, the racist Peggy blames Mama Thomas for improperly raising her son. Taking the witness stand, Bigger, in his testimony, tells Max in open court that he blames society for the way it treats Negroes. During a break in the trial, Jan privately apologizes to Bigger for patronizing him and not appreciating who he really was. Predictably, Bigger is found guilty of first degree murder by the racist all-white jury and immediately is sentenced to death.A few days later, Max pays Bigger a visit to his cell on Death Row where he thanks Max for treating him like a man and a human being. Bigger claims he now sees himself and others as they are, and knows the racist white people who convicted him hated him as much as he hated them. Bigger feels all right now, because he understands and no longer afraid of death. He asks Max to let Mama know he did not cry, and to tell Jan ""hello"". Max leaves the condemned man's cell."

Relieved, the two gamblers leave Santiago assured that they will be able to repay their loan on time.On the stable grounds, Dooley spots a woman named Nicki Dixon (Stella Stevens) preparing to ride and they banter. Although Nicki clearly wants nothing to do with Dooley, Elton believes that she has a romantic interest in his friend.That night, Dooley and Elton join Lou and Stump for drinks at a local bar, and Lou suggests that Dooley seduce Nicki to get the money rather than accepting DeFranco's loan.Driving to Nicki's luxury hotel in his decrepit car and wearing his best toupée, Dooley asks the valet if the hotel has self-parking. After Nicki offers Dooley cheese fondue and champagne, she asks him to open the bottle and he awkwardly sprays her with the bubbly wine. Using the accident as an excuse to ""slip into something more comfortable,"" Nicki leaves the room, and Dooley lights a cigarette. Nicki's dog jumps into Dooley's lap, causing him to drop his cigarette behind the couch pillows and douse the subsequent fire in the fondue sauce. Nicki returns to the living room and invites Dooley to join her in her outdoor hot tub.

After spending a period of time at a sanitarium, she was unable to relocate Lyle, and now believes that he has disguised himself as Dooley. Determined to ensure ""Lyle"" will never again be unfaithful, she throws the knife at Dooley, pinning his toupée to the patio door.The next day, Dooley and his friends go to DeFranco's mansion where he gives the four losers an envelope containing the cash for Fusco's loan. Before they leave, DeFranco gives them a positive tip on Papa Chippy, a horse owned by Fusco that is also running in the race on Wednesday. Later, as they discuss their situation, Dooley opens the envelope to discover Fusco mistakenly gave them $5,000 extra.On the day of the big race, Stump is late picking up his friends and claims to know a shortcut to the track, but the car blows a tire, and Stump does not have a spare. They flag down a passing pickup truck and persuade the driver to take them to the track.At the track, the four men run into DeFranco and Fusco, who is accompanied by Nicki. As they leave Stump and Elton behind to place the bet, Dooley and Lou go to the stable to slip Santiago their jockey's bribe and make certain that everything will go as planned. Waiting for the race to start, Nicki tells Fusco he looks like Lyle Dorf and suggests they meet after the races, secretly hiding the knife in her purse. Dooley tells Josh, another race track attendee, about their French Majesty tip, but Josh informs him that Santiago is a fraud who rubs chili powder on the noses of small animals, suggesting that the so-called ""mystery drug"" will make the horses run.In a panic, Lou, Stump, and Dooley attempt to stop Elton from placing the bet, but cannot find him in time. As the race is being run, Elton desperately remembers Jelly's story of the horse's last win, and the four friends scatter in search of a red shirt. Dooley rips Nicki's scarlet dress from her back and burst onto the track waving the cloth. Dooley and Stump are arrested before they can learn the winner, but are later bailed out of jail by Lou and Elton, who say that they lost the race. One of Fusco's men threatened Elton for their debts, but when Lou tells Elton to show Dooley and Stump his bruises from the encounter, the men open their jackets to reveal thousands of dollars of winnings concealed inside."

Loosely based on serial killerHenry Lee Lucas, the film follows Henry and his roommate Otis who Henry introduces to murdering randomly selected people. The killing spree depicted in the film starts after Otis' sister Becky comes to stay with them. The people they kill are strangers and in one particularly gruesome attack, kill all three members of a family during a home invasion. Henry lacks compassion in everything he does and isn't the kind to leave behind witnesses - of any kind.—garykmcd Henry likes to kill people, in different ways each time. Henry shares an apartment with Otis. When Otis' sister comes to stay, we see both sides of Henry; the ""guy-next-door"" and the serial killer. Low budget movie, with some graphic murder scenes.—Rob Hartill What would you do if you found out that the person living right along side you is really a serial killer, who engages in bizarre acts of sex with people and animals, living and dead, who killed his own mother? Well, meet Henry. He is a typical under-paid bug spray guy who lives amongst you. He is not Freddy or Jason, he's real. Henry was serving time in jail for killing his mother. He cannot seem to keep his story straight in his head, he can't really recall how he killed that one. She was cruel to him. She made him wear a dress to school, and she made him watch her have sex with dirty old men. He couldn't take it anymore, so one day, he just killed her. No remorse. He hooked up with a friend named Otis, and the two are living together. Otis' sister is moving in too, because she doesn't have any money. They are an interesting trio, each with their own set of morals. Otis' sister begins to fall for Henry, who has wonderful manners and seems to look out for her. Otis on the other hand, he just wants to see his sister naked. Henry and Otis go out for beers one night, and Henry introduces him to the act of murder. They kill a few prostitutes, and a ""hot"" items salesman. There is no limit to what they will do once they get a taste for it. Otis is becoming quickly addicted, and he can't pull himself out of the web Henry has weaved. That poor girl has no idea what is going on with them. She begins to date Henry. The two appear to fall in love. The cops don't have a clue. Henry is too smart for them. If you shoot one, and stab another, they will never make the connection between the two murders. It all becomes so random that it seems normal death to the police. Henry also has transportation on his side. He travels from town to town once the heat gets too heavy. He can pick up a few hitchhikers on the way and kill them. Bingo! A new guitar. This movie is very shocking, because you only see one or two of the fifteen murders happen, the rest you just see the before and after, with no middle. It makes you wonder what the hell was going on in between.—Natalie Wayne In the opening shot, a naked and bloody dead woman is seen lying in grass in a field.In a local diner, a man named Henry (Michael Rooker) finishes his meal, pays his bill, buys a pack of Kool brand cigarettes, and tells the waitress: ""real nice smile you got there"".

He drives to a suburban neighborhood and sees several women walking to their cars in a shopping mall parking lot. He follows one woman to her house, but leaves when he sees a man greet her in the driveway. Henry drives on until he picks up a female guitar-carrying hitchhiker.Meanwhile, a man named Otis (Tom Towles) meets his younger sister Becky (Tracy Arnold) at a terminal at Midway Airport. She has just arrived from Texas to stay with him for a while. Otis tells Becky that she looks terrible (from the bruises on her face). In his car driving from the airport, Otis says he always knew that Becky's husband, Leroy, was no good for her. Becky tells Otis that she is not sure how long she will stay.Otis and Becky arrive at Otis' seedy second floor apartment located at 1801 North Road in Chicago. They are seated at the kitchen table talking when Henry walks in. Henry has the hitchhiker's guitar and gives it to Otis as a gift. Otis introduces Henry to his sister, and Otis tells Becky that Henry is currently heading west and has been staying with him for a few weeks.The next day, Henry is seen working as an exterminator, spraying a kitchen. Henry's boss arrives as he is leaving and tells Henry that this is all the work he has for a while, but tells him to hold onto the spray can.

He gives Otis some money, and Otis agrees to meet with the teen later.That evening at Otis' apartment, Becky is in the kitchen cooking dinner and she asks Otis how he met Henry. Otis tells her that they met in prison a few years ago and that Henry was inside for killing his mother and one of her boyfriends with a baseball bat. After dinner, Henry helps Becky clear the table as well as wash and dry the dishes, while Otis leaves to go to his meeting with the teenager. While playing cards with Henry, Becky asks him about his father, and then tells him that her own father used to rape her. She asks Henry if he killed his mother and repeats what Otis told her. Henry tells Becky that he did kill his own mother but he didn't beat her to death with a baseball bat. He stabbed her. Henry explains that his mother was a prostitute who brought men over and make Henry watch while she had sex with them. When Henry would refuse, she would beat him. When Henry mentions about shooting his mother, Becky reminds him that he told her that he stabbed her. Henry corrects himself.The following evening, Becky again cooks dinner for Henry and Otis and mentions that she got a job as a shampoo girl at a local beauty parlor downtown to help out financially. Otis mentions that Becky's previous job was a stripper and that she used to dance naked at various strips clubs, and asks when she will dance for them. Otis tells Becky to get him a beer. When she comes back to the table with a can, he pulls her by her arm as if to give her a kiss. Henry suddenly grabs Otis' hair and yells ""Don't do that, Otis! She's your sister!"" Henry makes Otis apologize and promise not to do it again. Otis seems upset, so Becky suggests the two men go out for a beer.While driving along a seedy part of Milwaukee Avenue, Henry and Otis pick up a couple of women. The car pulls into an alley where they begin to make out with the two women. In the back seat, Henry suddenly kills her. The other woman, in the front seat with Otis, screams and tries to get out of the car, but Otis grabs her while Henry reaches up and snaps the woman's neck. He pulls the bodies out and leaves them in the alley. Otis is unsettled, but Henry pacifies him by getting him something to eat. At Otis' apartment later, Henry talks about killing people, and Otis seems to agree with Henry's philosophy that ""it is either you or them"".Another evening later, Otis in his living room and getting bad TV reception and kicks in the screen. He decides that they need a new television. Otis and Henry drive to a garage where they meet a portly man surrounded by television sets and other appliances. The three men discuss different TV's and a $500 video camera before Otis settles on a $50 black-and-white TV. The fat man is angry that they wasted his time to settle for a cheap TV and is rude towards Henry, who responds by stabbing him in his hand and then in the stomach. Then the two of them bash the $50 TV over his head and plug it it, killing the fat man. A little later, Otis, Henry and Becky are playing with the stolen video camera at Otis' apartment and watch TV with a new (and stolen) TV set.Another few days later, Otis goes to see his parole officer to discuss his job status. Later, Otis goes to a high school parking lot where he meets with the same teenage boy for a drug transaction. Otis touches the boy's leg, and receives a punch to his face by the homophobic youth who runs out of the car.That evening, a furious Otis tells Henry that he wants to go out and kill someone. Henry and Otis drive around Chicago and feign car trouble at Lower Wacker Drive where Otis shoots and kills a man who stops to offer help.The next day, while out filming with the video camera, Henry advises Otis about his MO for killing and tells him to kill in different ways so that the police will not find a pattern. Henry also says that it is important to keep moving and never stay in one place for too long. That evening, the two men head over to a house where they stage a home invasion. Henry films Otis tormenting a woman, while her husband is lying on the floor bound and gagged. The couple's teenage son returns and Henry drops the camera, runs to the boy and breaks his neck. Otis breaks the woman's neck and Henry stabs the man. Otis fondles and kisses the dead woman, and Henry orders him to stop. Later, Henry and Otis are back in the apartment watching the video. Otis rewinds the tape saying, ""I want to see it again.""Another day or two later, Becky is working at her job at the beauty parlor and during a break, she talks on the phone with her mother long distance and asks how she is doing.Meanwhile, Henry and Otis are driving around in Henry's car. As Otis leans out with the video camera, the camera is hit and broken. Otis throws it out the window and the two men argue. Henry warns Otis that he is getting careless and out of control with his antics. The growing warped Otis says that he wants to stop for a beer, and Henry forces him to get out of the car.Henry arrives back at the apartment where Becky tells him that she just quit her job so she can go back to Texas to live with her daughter and mother, and she asks Henry to go with her. Henry suggests going out to get a steak dinner at a local restaurant so they can talk about it some more. Plus, Henry wants to try out his new credit card (obviously stolen from one of his recent victims).The couple returns a few hours later to find Otis passed out drunk on the living room couch. Becky takes Henry to her bedroom where she takes off her shirt and begins to unbutton his, clearly wanting to have sex with him. Henry seems reluctant. Otis suddenly appears in the doorway and says ""I ain't interuptin' nothin', am I?"" Henry leaves the apartment and goes for a walk. He goes to a convenience store to buy some more Kool cigarettes for himself. He is angry, but backs out on his sudden urge to kill the store clerk. Outside in an alley, he meets a middle-aged woman walking a dog. He follows the woman for a while, but again backs out from killing her and heads back to the apartment.Upon arriving back at the apartment, Henry finds Otis on top of a partially unclothed Becky, clearly raping her while choking her with his shirt. Henry kicks him off and beats him until Otis breaks a liquor bottle over his head. Just when Otis is about to stab Henry with the broken bottle's jagged edge, Becky leaps up and stabs Otis in his eye with the sharp edge of a steel comb. Henry crawls to the wounded and screaming Otis and stabs him in the stomach with his hunting knife, killing him at last. Becky yells at Henry to get the police, but Henry tells her to shut up and let him think. After a minute, he tells Becky help him clean up the mess and pack up so they can leave since their names are not on the lease of the apartment. While Becky cleans up the blood, Henry chops up Otis in the bathtub and puts his remains in several black plastic trash bags and then puts the bags in a suitcase. Henry and Becky leave the apartment carrying several suitcases as well as the guitar case. They drive to a bridge and throw the suitcase containing Otis' cut up body into the Chicago river.While driving out of the city, Henry says that they are going to hide out at his sister's ranch out west and they will send for Becky's daughter. Becky tells Henry that she loves him. Henry replies unemotionally, ""I guess I love you too."" The two of them drive to a rural motel and check in for the night. Becky plays with the guitar while Henry looks at himself in the bathroom mirror. He tells Becky that they need to get some sleep for they have a long drive tomorrow.The next morning, Henry showers, shaves, packs up and leaves the motel by himself. He stops his car a short distance from the motel along a rural road, pops open the car trunk and takes out Becky's blood stained suitcase. He drives away, leaving the suitcase (obviously containing Becky's dismembered body in it) behind."

Called to the scene, Ray finds the body with a large open wound in the face, similar to one that could have been made by an axe.The next day, Chris and J.C. are confronted by the frat brothers, upset over the fact that they believe they are responsible for the previous night's incident. After surviving their encounter, they are then taken in for questioning by the police. Based on the testimony of a janitor that witnessed them running out of university medical center, ""screaming like banshees,"" they confess to breaking in, but deny taking the corpse out. That night, the attendant found dead gets up from his slab and runs into the same janitor.After the dead and buried cat of one of the sorority sisters comes back, Cynthia confesses it to Chris and J.C. and goes on about the dead body found at the sorority house. Although both are skeptical of her story about them being zombies, J.C. sees that she is leaning on Chris' shoulder, and leaves the two alone to go to the bathroom, where the now-possessed janitor enters and lets loose more of the slugs.As Chris walks Cynthia back to the sorority house, he runs into Cameron who has overheard the entire story. Back at Ray's home, the two talk about their high school sweethearts. Ray's story is more elaborate as he goes on about how they broke up and he became a cop and how he was called out to the site where she had been hacked up by a lunatic. He goes on to tell of how he tracked down the escaped patient, killed him and buried him in the same spot on which the House Mother's cottage now sits. Just then, Ray gets a call where the House Mother has been hacked up to death by the axe-wielding corpse that broke in through the floor. The killer is finally tracked down and cornered by the police, but numerous gunshots have no effect. Cameron then takes his shotgun and blows its head off, which releases more of the little creeps.The next night, everyone is getting ready for the formal when Chris notices a tape recorder on which J.C. has recorded a posthumous message to his friend, telling him that one of the things has incubated in his brain and that he had discovered, after lighting one with a match, that heat can destroy them. Chris then runs into the boiler room, where his friend has told him he was headed in an attempt to kill those inside him. Chris then shows up at Ray's place, which Ray has sealed up, and he fills him in. After grabbing his gun and turning off the gas, he takes Chris to a police armory to get a flamethrower. They come to the sorority house just as Cynthia is breaking up with Brad who has become possessed. After killing him, the Delta fraternity brothers show up - despite having been killed in a bus crash. While Chris and Cynthia team up with shotgun and flamethrower to destroy the dead outside, Cameron does likewise inside. After stopping the horde, Chris spots more slugs racing across the ground that are headed into the house's basement. Cynthia remembers that this is where specimen brains are being kept. When they go down below, they find Cameron, tape across his mouth, prepping a can of gasoline. They also find the creatures gathered in a huge swarm in the corner. Cameron begins counting down as he splashes gasoline everywhere. Cynthia and Chris turn and run out of the house, counting down in sync with Cameron. Cameron fills the basement with gas and just as some of the parasites leap at him, he flicks his lighter and the house goes up in a fiery explosion. Watching the sorority house burn, Chris and Cynthia share a kiss. The scene ends when the dog that caused the bus accident returns, opens its mouth, and a slug jumps out."

She seeks help at a sleep disorder research center, but in doing so she encounters some unexpected results ...—Homme A. Piest <piest@pobox.leidenuniv.nl> Struggling musician Kathy Gardner (Kristy Mcnichol) has had her life ruled by her father (Paul Shenar).

He later returns, using his spare keys, and assaults Kathy. Unable to sleep due to nightmares of the incident, Kathy's approached by Michael Hansen (Ben Masters), who's studying the dream movements of animals. However his experimental ""DREAM"" therapy Induces Kathy to act out her nightmares and darkest fears.—Barry J,""Gravesend"" Kent UK. Flutist Kathy Gardner was raised in privilege in Washington, DC by her wealthy, domineering, widowed father, Ben Gardner. In one of her first acts of independence from her father, Kathy decides to join Kevin McCann's jazz combo for a long term club gig in New York City, the two who embark on a relationship, rather than follow Ben's plan of accompanying him on a extended trip to Japan. In New York, Kathy is physically assaulted in her apartment late one night by an intruder. While Kathy is already prone to vivid dreams, usually fantasies on something in her reality, those dreams change to nightmares, always of the events around the assault. Looking for some relief in no longer being able to sleep without the trauma of the nightmare, Kathy turns to many different professionals for help, including a sleep clinic. While the administration of the sleep clinic tells her that it is not a counseling service that can provide assistance to her, Dr. Michael Hansen, a low level researcher at the clinic who overhears her story, believes that he may be able to help her, despite his research to date only being on animal subjects. While Kathy does get some relief from Michael's treatment, she, in turn, begins to trust him implicitly as he gets further into his experimentation on her, which leads to a potentially deadly situation as Kathy's dreams/nightmares blur with reality, especially as it relates to one specific item associated with the assault.—Huggo Kevin McCann (Justin Dears), a conservatory music teacher, praises Kathy Gardner's (Kristy McNichol) flute solo and invites her to join his jazz quartet in New York City for the summer, offering a friend's Greenwich Village apartment that she can sublet.

She claims the class starts in a week, and Claire tells her not to pass up the opportunity. On the way home, Martin warns Claire not to interfere. Claire claims she was only trying to be supportive. Martin responds that her support did not help Kathy's mother and it will not help Kathy. Claire tells him that she does not regret her actions. Ben's possessiveness made his wife seek out lovers. When Ben threw her out, she got drunk and was killed in an accident. Claire blames Ben completely for her death. Later at home, Kathy tells her father she will be happy to go to Japan, but he mulls over the situation, and gives his permission for her to go to New York City.A few days later, Kathy moves into the sublet and accidentally meets Danny (Joseph Culp), looking for his girlfriend, Maggie, the previous tenant.Kathy's first club date is a success and Kevin accompanies her back to the Village apartment. Kevin breaks some mugs showing off his limited juggling skills. After they clean up the broken shards of pottery, they kiss and make love.

She wakes to the sound of sirens in the street, warms up some milk in the kitchen, and notices that her front door is unlocked. When she attempts to reset the chain, Danny appears and dangles a set of keys he claims his girlfriend Maggie gave him. He holds a switchblade to Kathy's chin, and announces that he is going to ""fuck her,"" but wants to know where Maggie is. When she claims not to know, he threatens to hurt her. She throws the boiling milk in his face and grabs his knife and stabs him in the back.Later, as the police interrogate Kathy, her father arrives and asks for a few minutes with his daughter. After hearing about her ordeal earlier, he advises her to change her story because she stabbed an unarmed blind man in the back, and the police may not believe it was in self-defense. He tells her to say that she blacked out and when she regained consciousness, she was standing over Danny holding a knife. She knows it was self-defense, but she complies. After Kathy finishes the police report, her father temporarily sets her up in a hotel room. Soon, Kathy announces that she is going to finish her master class and returns to her apartment. Kevin agrees to move in.At night, sirens outside wake Kathy up. She walks into the kitchen and hears clanking pipes. Later, she wakes from a nightmare about Danny, and Kevin comforts her. She visits a sleep doctor who claims her nightmares will subside with time but refuses to write her a prescription for sleeping pills. She visits a sleep research center seeking relief, but the doctor thinks she would have better luck seeing a psychiatrist. After overhearing her conversation, another researcher named Dr. Michael Hansen (Ben Masters) admits that although his research normally involves animals, he thinks he can help her. In his lab, he attaches electrodes to Kathy's body. After he calms her, Dr. Hansen records her verbal recollection of her nightmare. Afterward, he shows Kathy the data he collected and is struck by how vivid her dream state is.At the club, a record producer named Vaughn Capisi (Matthew Long) approaches Kevin about recording an album in London, England.At night, Kathy uses Michael's technique as she goes to sleep. She remembers her nightmare out loud and stops it at a safe point. She rolls over to look at Kevin, but sees Danny instead. When he grabs her face, she slaps him repeatedly. As she wakes, Kevin is in bed next to her.The next day, Kathy recounts her experience to Dr. Hansen, who wants to refer her to a psychiatrist. She protests that she cannot start treatment with a new doctor because she has to go to London to work on an album. She asks Dr. Hansen to help her again. This time he gives her a technique to make changes in her nightmare. As he observes Kathy sleeping, he watches for signs of distress. In Kathy's dream, she escapes her captor, but then her dream becomes a nightmare. Dr. Hansen wrestles her to the floor and she wakes up. He asks her about the original attack, and she recalls how Danny dropped his knife. She picked it up and stabbed him. She confesses that she never felt so good as when she stabbed Danny. Dr. Hansen assures her what happened is a normal response. Kathy agrees to another session under the electrodes. This time, Kathy's nightmare switches to her Victorian era dream of boating on the lake. Both she and Dr. Hansen are happy that she is able to change the outcome of her dream.Soon, Kathy visits her father in Washington, D. C., before she travels to London. When her father refuses to see her after learning of her plans, she returns to New York City early to find Kevin in bed with another woman. She makes an unplanned visit to the sleep lab. She discovers that Dr. Hansen has taken a drug to help him act out his dreams, and she has caught him in the middle of an experiment. When he sees her, he thinks he might be dreaming until he touches her shoulder and determines she is real. He rewinds the videotape of his experiment and realizes the drug stops the normal paralysis that occurs during dreaming, but he cannot remember his dream.Kathy volunteers to wake him at the right moments so he can document his dreams, but it becomes clear that his dreams are not vivid enough to break the paralysis. When he explains that he has submitted a proposal to do the experiment officially, Kathy agrees to take the drug and undergo the experiment. In her dream state, Kathy wakes up after hearing the siren and goes to the kitchen. She believes her dream stops and she is back in the sleep lab, telling Dr. Hansen the experiment is not working. She rises from the bed and bangs on the locked door. Soon, she discovers a menacing-looking Dr. Hansen in the room with her. He grabs her and has a scalpel in his hand. She breaks free, but he pushes her down on the bed and fondles her. She struggles as he rapes her. She wakes up, blames Dr. Hansen for not stopping the experiment sooner, and leaves. Dr. Hansen realizes that he forgot to give her an antidote that would restore her body chemistry. Dr. Hansen visits Kathy at her Village apartment, but Kathy is already on a plane to London.In the hotel in London, Kathy wanders the hallway in a dream state and realizes that Dr. Hansen forgot the antidote. When she is unable to reach him, she calls her father. Meanwhile, Dr. Hansen travels to London to save Kathy. Ben Gardner's secretary tells Kathy that her father is in London and she meets him at his hotel. When Kathy tells her father about her experiences with sleep doctors and the sleep lab, Ben Gardner's solution is to get her the sleeping pills that were first recommended. It will buy them some time until they return home and can sort out her problems. Dr. Hansen telephones Capisi recording studio and discovers that Kathy is with her father.As Kathy waits for her father to return, she goes to sleep and dreams she is in her childhood bedroom. She hears a knock at the door and sees a lamp from the Village apartment. She walks down a long corridor and stops at a fruit basket with a knife on the table. She puts the knife in her pocket. She opens the door for her father, but it is the Village apartment door. Her father greets her in a tuxedo carrying her prescription. The prescription turns into a flower rose and her father disappears. Danny appears before her with a switchblade. Her father hands her the pills, but she sees Danny dangling the apartment keys. She stabs Danny with the knife hidden in her pocket, runs to the balcony, and crouches on the railing. Dr. Hansen watches Kathy from the balcony of a neighboring room. She sees a bird flying and reaches out to join it, but Hansen catches her before she plummets to her death. They hug and Kathy smiles back at her father."

While this would ordinarily be just another mess, this particular transmission contains a hungry monster who quickly begins snacking on the Puttermans and their guests. Only the son has any knowledge of what's going on, but nobody believes him.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> In the opening scene, a mutant creature disposal unit on the Planet Pluton has gone haywire, sending toxic electrical energy to Earth.In a suburban neighborhood, shrew housewife Raquel Putterman (Mary Woronov) and her 16-year-old punk teenage daughter, Suzy (Diane Franklin), blame husband and father, Stan Putterman (Gerrit Graham), for breaking their televisions when he installs a new satellite dish, but the technology failure has nothing to do with him. Stan asks Norton (Sonny Carl Davis), the satellite dish representative, to fix his problem, but Norton claims the service contract only allows him to help with repairs not installation. In his frustration, Stan damages the dish with a hammer to create the need for repair. However, a bolt of lightning hits the satellite receiver, and the television sets are back in service.As Stan demonstrates the wide range of channels, he and his father-in-law, ""Grampa,"" (Bert Remsen) fight over the remote control. As they break the unit, part of the satellite equipment on the patio overheats and melts. In the Putterman living room, the screen shifts from static to a program titled ""Medusa's Midnight Horrorthon"". Grampa and his 13-year-old grandson, Sherman Putterman (Chad Allen), are engrossed as prehistoric dinosaurs battle each other.Suzy goes on a date with ""OD,"" (Jonathan Gries) her rocker boyfriend, while Stan and Raquel spend the night on the lookout for swinger couples with whom to have sex. Grampa and Sherman stare at a round, gelatinous monster on television, but the channel spontaneously reverts to ""Medusa's Midnight Horrorthon"" and they fall asleep in front of the television. Later, the monster leaps out of the television and scares Grampa and Sherman. When Sherman claims he saw a monster, Grampa retorts that monsters do not exist, and he insists that Sherman saw a burglar.Grampa locks his grandson in the family's bomb shelter, arms himself with rifles, and instructs Sherman on which weapons to use. Grampa questions Norton when he arrives to fix the satellite dish. The repairman has no knowledge of any burglars but notices that the wiring from the satellite box is spilling out like spaghetti. As Grampa searches the house, Sherman hears a scream from the patio. Norton, the repairman, becomes the monster's first victim. Grampa comes face to face with the monster on the television screen, but is not fazed. The monster squeezes Grampa's head. As brain juice and blood matter spill to the floor, the monster devours Grampa and his clothing.When Sherman sees the monster convert to electromagnetic waves and disappear into the television screen, he locks himself in the bomb shelter and calls the police. Officer Nutky (Ian Patrick Williams) believes Sherman's call is a prank, and ignores him, but not before letting him off with a warning. Sherman tries to warn his parents when they bring home another swinging couple couple named Cherry (Randi Brooks) and Spiro (Alejandro Rey). Raquel notices a puddle of blood and brain matter on the floor. Sherman claims that the puddle is all that remains of Grampa, but she demands her son stop telling stories. Stan gives Cherry and Spiro a tour of the house, and shows off the bedroom hot tub. He fiddles with the satellite channels, and ignores a warning from Pluthar (William Paulson), a planet Pluton sanitation captain, of danger that can only be stopped if Earthlings destroy their televisions and other electronic devices.In the bomb shelter, the monster emerges from the TV set and transforms into Grampa. Through the shelter door, Grampa tells Raquel Putterman that everything is fine. Sherman, however, insists that Grampa is dead. Raquel locks her son in the shelter, despite his pleas. Sherman grabs his loaded rifle and searches for his grandfather, but the monster has departed back into the TV screen.Raquel returns to the bedroom, and suggests that Spiro help mix cocktails. Cherry has a bathing suit underneath her dress, and tries out the hot tub while Stan changes into a swimsuit.Sherman listens as Pluthar issues a second warning over the shelter television set. The alien claims that an accident occurred at the mutant disposal unit that could result in the annihilation of Earth should the monster gain access to any TV station. Sherman panics and calls the ""Medusa's Midnight Horrorthon"" studio phone number, but Medusa (Jennifer Richards) does not believe his monster story and hangs up.Meanwhile, Raquel discovers that Spiro is interested in homosexual sex with Stan. When Spiro brings Cherry her drink, Raquel breaks the news to Stan. Spiro joins Cherry in the hot tub, but as he approaches her, two monster arms pull him underwater. When Stan and Raquel return to their guests, they are missing. The monster rises out of the murky water, attacks Stan, and Raquel screams. Sherman hears his parents scream, and calls the police a second time. Officer Nutky threatens him with an arrest. Sherman then uses explosives to blow open the bomb shelter door.A few minutes later, Suzy and OD return home, but do not believe Sherman's rantings about the monster. They make their way to their parents' bedroom. Suzy discovers her parents, their guests, and Grampa in bed together (the monster is using their corpses to impersonate them). They claim to be having fun, and shoo her away.Back in the living room, the monster emerges from the TV set and chases after OD, but decides not to attack because OD's black leather-spiked arm wear, which OD used to shield himself, reminds it of someone important from its childhood. OD offers the monster a snack, and soon, Suzy, Sherman, and OD are teaching the creature English and emptying the refrigerator to satisfy its appetite. They introduce the monster to American rock and roll, and OD plays a cassette tape of his heavy metal band. After the monster learns their names, they teach it about technology. Suzy decides they can promote the creature and make money. Suzy, OD and Sherman agree to be equal partners in the venture. They want their monster to be on television, and call Medusa for help. They invite her to party with the creature, but it is unclear whether she will come or not.Officer Nutky arrives with a warrant for Sherman's arrest. The monster becomes agitated when Pluthar, the Pluton sanitation captain, appears on TV again for the third time and delivers his warning on the screen. This sets the monster off again and, after OD provokes it further in a botched attempt to calm it down, it grabs OD by the face with a monster within the monster's mouth and eats him alive. Officer Nutky announces to Sherman that he's under arrest for making prank phone calls to the station, but Sherman and Suzy escape and hide in the bomb shelter. The monster confronts the policeman, who opens fire on it with his pistol, now realizing that Sherman was telling the truth all along. Unaffected by the bullets, the monster grabs the officer's gun, skins off Nutky's hand, then devours the rest of him as well.After Suzy finds what's left of OD in the living room, Sherman remarks that they have no choice but to kill it. The monster almost approaches Suzy but Sherman blasts the TV to pieces before the monster can appear. They stock up on weapons and search each room of the house for the creature. When Suzy and Sherman return to their parents bedroom, they find the monster has eaten the adults leaving just puddles of blood and slime on the floor and scraps on the bed. Sherman and Suzy then set about smashing every TV set in the house.Sherman and Suzy find the monster back in the living room watching the TV set. Sherman sneaks up on the monster from behind, but slips on the creature's trailing slime. The monster grabs him by the leg with one of its tentacles, but Sherman uses his knife to free himself.A little later in the living room, Pluthar appears in a spacesuit out of the TV set, and announces that he has come to rescue Sherman and Suzy. He explains that, on his planet, ""hungry beasts"" are pets like dogs and cats, but when they mutate they become unstable and must be destroyed. The monster is a hungry beast that mutated and was accidentally sent to Earth instead of being exterminated.Medusa arrives at the house where she lets herself in and mistakenly believes Pluthar is about to hurt Sherman and Suzy. She approaches Pluthar, and damages his space helmet by cracking his helmet, which kills him. The monster then blasts through a wall and Suzy screams. Sherman fires Pluthar's rifle but misses, and then the rifle jams. Sherman, wearing OD's arm spikes and holding his arms in a similar position to the way OD did earlier, is sucked into the monster's mouth, disillusioned into believing the monster will have another change of heart. It then cuts to black.In the morning, the monster, having presumably eaten Sherman and Suzy, is now part-Medusa. Climbing into Medusa's limousine, the new hybrid monster orders the chauffeur to drive to the television studio... implying that it will eat the TV staff and use the technology of the TV station and satellite dishes to spread its image all around the world. With no one to stop the monster now, planet Earth is apparently doomed."
The Sacrifice,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091670/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"At the dawn of World War III, a man searches for a way to restore peace to the world and finds he must give something in return. Alexander, a journalist and former actor and philosopher, tells his little son how worried he is about the lack of spirituality of modern mankind. In the night of his birthday, the third world war breaks out. In his despair Alexander turns himself in a prayer to God, offering him everything to have the war not happen at all.—Gert de Boer It is Alexander's birthday, and his family have gathered at his remote cottage to celebrate. The celebrations are marred, however, first by conventional family intrigue, then by the terrifying news that the low-flying jet planes signalled the start of a nuclear war between the superpowers. As the family attempts to cope, Alexander is troubled by extraordinary dreams, and then informed by the unfathomable philosopher-postman, Otto, that he has the power to redeem the world, including his dear young son, if only he will visit the solitary Maria, who Otto insists is a witch.—Sarah K. Alexander is an aging actor and writer who has taken retirement from acting and writing. He is shown to be playfully talking to a little boy he calls as the ""Little Man"" to whom he describes how his mother and he met. In Alexander's birthday,his family gathers at his cottage in the pastoral lands when the terrifying news that the low-flying jet planes signalled the start of a nuclear war between the superpowers. Alexander's dreams and the real world are somehow shown to have merged into some dreamy scenes which are hauntingly long and uncoordinated. As the family attempts to cope, Alexander vows to God in his dreams that he would ""sacrifice"" everything he loves in order to save this world from the catastrophe caused by nuclear weapons. He is met by the queer post-man Otto in his dreams who tells him to seek help of Maria who is supposed to be a witch with powers and only whose love can bring in peace. At the end it appears like Alexander has woken up from his dream and does distinctly similar things he happened to witness in his dreams. He puts his house on fire and watches it from a distance when his family arrives and puts him into a van that indicates him to be mentally ill and been taken to an asylum. He runs to Maria, the maid for help. At the end ""Little Man"" is shown to water the dead tree he and Alexander had planted looking up to it waiting for it to bloom someday, while Maria cycles and reaches to see the van once again carrying Alexander, indicating ""Little Man"" might as well be the child born out of love between Maria and Alexander, not being able to ever confess it to the world might be the guilt that made Alexander ""Sacrifice"" everything."

Lady Jane,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091374/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of Lady Jane Grey, who was Queen of England for only nine days. The death of King Henry VIII throws his kingdom into chaos because of succession disputes. His weak son King Edward VI is on his deathbed. Anxious to keep England true to the Reformation, a scheming minister John Dudley marries off his son, Guilford, to Lady Jane Grey, whom he places on the throne after Edward dies. At first hostile to each other, Guilford and Jane fall in love. But they cannot withstand the course of power which will lead to their ultimate downfall.—Samantha Santa Maria <TE7441667@ntuvax.ntu.ac.sg> Somerset has lost the power struggle with Northumberland and is executed. Northumberland, ruler of the realm due to Edward VI's minority, sees that the succession is key as Edward is unmarried. He will call on his friend Suffolk, Henry Grey, as Suffolk's wife, Frances Brandon, granddaughter of Henry VII, and their daughter Jane Grey, follow Henry VIII's daughters in the line of succession.
Jane's great scholarship is made evident in a scene in which she interacts with and debates a priest who is a classical scholar. In the next scene, Edward notes ""her learning is an example to us all.""Northumberland advises Frances that Edward is dying and their plotting to deny Mary and Elizabeth the throne begins. The plan is to get Edward to modify the line of succession to exclude his sisters and to have Frances defer the throne to Jane. To consolidate power, Suffolk agrees to have Jane Grey marry Guilford Dudley, Northumberland's son. Jane is cold on the idea, suggesting Edward would disapprove. Jane is beaten by her mother for this remark. Northumberland convinces Edward that the marriage is necessary for the Reformation. Jane is convinced by Edward to marry Guilford ""for me.""Edward's health grows much worse. Northumberland asks the doctor to give Edward arsenic to keep him alive for a few extra days, which will buy Northumberland time to convince Edward to sign the document modifying the line of succession.Guilford is found in a pub and advised he is to be married. In his first meeting with Jane, she makes it clear that her priorities are study and prayer and he notes that he is the type that likes pubs and prostitutes. Their wedding night is absurd, as Guilford falls asleep just moments after Jane enters the bedroom.On a journey together, Guilford and Jane see commoners. Guilford offers one of them coins as alms. The commoner throws the money back, displaying that he wears the brand of a beggar, and yells ""give us back our land,"" which could be a reference to the actions of Henry VIII, but more likely refers to enclosure. It makes little sense to Jane., but when they are next alone, Guilford explains what they had seen. He recounts a) confiscation of land during the dissolution of the monasteries, b) enclosure (fencing in) of common grazing land by landlords that ruined the livelihood of small landowners, c) and the inflation of the English currency. He notes that begging has been made illegal, and that those found begging were forced to wear a brand of disgrace. Jane, it seems, is learning that her quiet piety may not be enough to save the poor and transform England.Northumberland attends to Edward, who is on his deathbed. He proposes the change to the line of succession, noting that Mary's succession would hurt England. Edward notes ""but she's my sister."" Northumberland cleverly replies ""it's the duty of a Christian king to set aside the prejudices of the blood in favor of the greater good of God and country."" Edward is sold on the necessity of modifying the line of succession and signs Northumberland's document.
Back at home, the newlyweds have another chat. ""What do you wish for?"", Guilford asks. When she replies with an idea that would improve England, he drops a glass full of wine, destroying it, and says ""then it is done."" She asks the same of him, gets a similar response, and similarly, but unexpectedly, destroys a wine glass. The game continues, to the delight of both. Jane has come out of her shell, daring to dream with Guilford of a better England. She is no longer a quiet, pious girl too busy with study and prayer to consider the plight of England, but a woman in touch with things a queen might dwell upon, though unaware of the plot to make her queen.Northumberland now seeks the Privy Seal for the document proposing change to the line of succession. Some council members argue that, given Edward's infirmity, ratification might be treasonous, but they acquiesce when reminded that many English lands would revert to Rome if Mary became queen.Northumberland's plot has nearly succeeded, but he is not able to apprehend Mary and Elizabeth. Edward dies and Northumberland fears to proclaim Jane queen with Mary and Elizabeth still at large. However, he decides that he must do so and calls a meeting, insisting that Jane and Guilford attend, but not telling them why their presence is required. Northumberland announces Edward's death and then proclaims that Jane is the new queen.Jane's rejects the crown, shouting ""no, it is not mine!"" She learns that Guilford will be crowned king, and accuses him of having been in on the plot, but he convinces her this is not so. She accepts the crown. Her ascension is announced publicly, but meets more with confusion than joy. In a letter the privy council receives, Mary proclaims herself queen. Northumberland asks Suffolk to assemble an army to repel Mary. Queen Jane, unannounced, walks in on the meeting and changes the subject, demanding social reforms. Northumberland interrupts to request her signature on the document proposing the raising of an army by her father. Queen Jane refuses to sign unless Northumberland himself agrees to lead the troops that will defend her realm. He agrees and she signs. He proceeds to capture several supporters of Mary, but Jane has them all released. She hears that the campaign against Mary is failing. When Suffolk barges in on her and Guilford to advise them that Northumberland has been declared a traitor and that Mary has been named queen, ending Jane's nine day reign, things are clarified. Most unexpectedly, Jane's remark is ""What a relief. Father, can we go home?"" Predictably, though, Jane and Guilford are arrested, separated, and imprisoned in the Tower, as is Northumberland.Mary rides triumphantly into England, and her first act is to free those incarcerated in the Tower for having opposed the Reformation, an ominous sign. Queen Mary speaks to Jane and makes it clear that, although a death sentence is near certain when Jane is tried, she intends to grant a reprieve. As Jane exits, the imperial ambassador enters, and Queen Mary advises him that she does not plan to execute Jane. The imperial ambassador notes that Phillip, with whom Queen Mary is in love, will not visit while Jane lives. Learning that her marriage appears to hinge on this execution grieves Queen Mary, who has suffered greatly from loneliness.Suffolk advises his wife that he will join a revolt (which came to be known as Wyatt's rebellion) against Queen Mary. Jane learns that this revolt, with which she was unfamiliar, failed, and that Suffolk, who was one of its leaders, has been arrested. Jane and Guilford are tried, convicted and sentenced to beheading. Jane learns that Queen Mary, due to Suffolk's treason, will no longer grant a reprieve unless Jane embraces the doctrines of Catholicism, Predictably, Jane refuses.Jane learns that Guilford has been executed on Tower Hill, and then she, herself, is led to the scaffold on Tower Green, where she is beheaded. Though still grievous of having had to execute Jane, Queen Mary is seen leaving the Tower, proclaiming ""I am going to meet my husband.""A priest, the same one that had debated with Jane in the movie's opening minutes, looks to the heavens, reflects on Jane's life and quotes Plato in the movie's final line: ""The soul takes flight to the world that is invisible but there arriving she is sure of bliss and forever dwells in paradise."""

The Green Ray,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091830/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"It's July, and Delphine has nowhere to go for the summer. She feels very bored and ""empty"", but this won't last; one day she accidently meets someone who seems to be totally made for her... In the July summer of 1986, Delphine situates herself in Paris - helplessly alone, with nowhere go. On a sporadic holiday, she fails to enchant herself with romance and connection, while her anxieties cause her to reject the new. Somewhere along the way, she finds what she didn't know she needed. At the start of summer vacation, Delphine (Marie Revière) has just suffered the breakup of a relationship and her traveling companion has ditched her so that her new boyfriend can accompany her to Greece instead. She is left without plans at a time when Paris is emptying for the summer. Another friend invites Delphine to join a beach party for the weekend, but she finds that she's the only one amongst the group who is single so she quickly returns to Paris. Her family pressures her to spend the holidays with them in Ireland, but she resists. She travels alone to the Alps, but is put off by hordes of vacationers and turns around. Traveling restlessly, the theme of the movie (characterized by Roger Ebert) becomes clear: Delphine ""is incapable of playing the dumb singles games that lead to one-night stands."" She meets a new girlfriend, who flirts with two young men and she flees in anger. She recoils from the chat-up lines of the guys she meets in bars and on trains. She simply cannot engage in that kind of mindless double-talk any longer. Beneath her boredom is genuine anger at the roles that single women are sometimes expected to play. While in Biarritz she eavesdrops on a conversation about Jules Verne's novel Le Rayon Vert (The Green Ray). According to Verne, when one sees a rare green flash at sunset, one's own thoughts and those of others are revealed as if by magic. At the Biarritz railway station she meets a young man who is travelling to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. She goes with him and together they observe le rayon vert (the green flash). Delphine's traveling companion cancels two weeks before her holiday, so Delphine, a Parisian secretary, is at loose ends. She doesn't want to travel by herself, but has no boyfriend and seems unable to meet new people. A friend takes her to Cherbourg; after a few days there, the weepy and self-pitying Delphine goes back to Paris. She tries the Alps, but returns the same day. Next, it's the beach: once there, she chats with an outgoing Swede, a party girl, and a friendship seems to bud; then, suddenly, Delphine bolts, heading back to Paris. As she waits at the Biarritz train station, a young man catches her eye; perhaps a sunset and the sun's green ray await.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>"

But then the organisms fell to earth with SkyLab and they are now starting to infect people by brutally killing them off. And these 3 friends and NASA scientist must get an antidote from a NASA Lab nearby and save themselves and the rest of the world.—Dylan Conner In 1973, the space satellite Skylab was launched into orbit. Experiments with a lethal alien microbe were performed by being tested on animals aboard Skylab due to being too lethal to be performed on Earth. The results were horrific. In 1979, Skylab crash landed onto Earth, and a huge chunk of the satellite crashed outside a small village in Spain called Duarte. Now it is 1984. A cow has been exposed to the virus, originally thought to have burned up upon re-entry, among the wrecked remains of Skylab and dies. Wild dogs are later seen eating the corpse of the cow and one of the dogs is swallowed whole by an organism within the cow's corpse. The virus then starts to spread. At the same time, three American teenagers, Michael, Damon and Samantha on a pre-college vacation are spending the summer in Europe traveling in a rented camper with a dune buggy in tow. Their camper breaks down and they are forced to go into the village and stay for the night at a nearby trailer park. The next morning, NASA scientist Dr. W. Tracer has flown in from the United States to meet with a colleague, Captain J.J. Wells to discuss the virus and the infection of the local captain. Back at the trailer park, Michael, Damon and Samantha step out of their trailer for air and meet an Indian Family, the Bhodis, who happen to be camping right next to them. They talk to the Bhodis who are friendly but act somewhat weird at the same time. The three teenagers then decide to go to a diner for lunch.At the diner, Damon tells Michael and Samantha that he is going to make a quick errand and go to an auto parts shop to pick up parts for the camper. When he returns, Damon says that the store was closed but he noticed that the owner was unresponsive. Samantha tells Damon that he was more than likely asleep. Damon further elaborates on weird events that occurred at the store, such as a tire being thrown into the window and the then-awaking owner, despite being badly hurt by the shards of glass, not succumbing to the pain at all. Before leaving the diner, Michael calls for the bill and insists that Damon pay for their meal, much to Damon's chagrin after he says that Michael didn't even like his meal. When the waitress brings the bill, her hair is all messed up and her nose is bleeding as well. Meanwhile, Dr. Tracer and Captain Wells are examining the deformed corpse of the local captain at a hotel. The captain became deformed as a result of the alien virus. Blood from the captain's face splatters on the shirt of Captain Wells. Dr. Tracer and Captain Wells then go to a secret NASA laboratory outside the village to work on a cure. Dr. Tracer intends on using Wells as a guinea pig for the cure. When Wells finds out he is infected due to the Captain's blood splattering on his shirt, he tells Dr. Tracer that is unsure whether to kill the doctor or himself. He then tells Dr. Tracer to find another ""guinea pig"" and commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. As Dr. Tracer runs off, an alien can be heard making its way out of what's left of Wells. Back at the trailer park, Samantha has had enough of being treated unfairly by Michael and Damon and decides to take the dune buggy and look around the village for the rest of the day. While in the village, Samantha encounters Dr. Tracer but ignores the doctor's plea to come with him on behalf of the alien virus. While at a local grocery store, Samantha encounters an infected man wearing a weird mask who then takes her outside to have her smashed by a garbage truck driven by an infected villager. Samantha however, escapes her fate by attacking the masked man and leaves him to get run over by the truck. She is then confronted by Dr. Tracer again who takes her to the local hotel to work on a cure for the alien virus.Later that night, Michael and Damon realize that Samantha has been gone unusually long, and when they hear her via the camper radio talking in a scared fashion to someone (Actually, Dr. Tracer), they think she has been kidnapped. Michael tells Damon to see Mr. Bhodi for help on getting the camper started back up. Damon knocks on the Bhodis' trailer door, but there is no answer. Damon then wanders in to ask for help, only to see the corpses of Mrs. Bhodi and their daughter Baby and presumably alien organisms as well (similar to what was unleashed from Captain Wells). Damon runs out sickened and throws up in a garbage can. Michael thinks that Damon is joking around, but Damon insists that he is not and tells Michael to look in the camper for himself. He opens the door and noticed a spilled bottle of tomato juice as well as Baby's tricycle and doll. Mr. Bhodi's bloody corpse then falls down and shocks Michael, who immediately closes the camper door. Michael and Damon, after quickly repairing the camper, immediately drive the camper back into the village to look for Samantha. At the hotel, Samantha wanders around the hotel hallway and notices that all but one door is locked. She then goes inside the unlocked room and notices, to her horror, the deformed corpse of the captain. An alien then bursts out of the captain's face and nearly attacks Samantha, but she is saved by Dr. Tracer. Tracer later uses the radio board in the hotel to call for a napalm air strike of the village so that the virus will not spread anywhere else.Upon arriving at the hotel, Michael and Damon go inside and find Samantha as well as Dr. Tracer, whom they pin down to the floor under the impression he kidnapped Samantha. Dr. Tracer tells Michael and Damon that it isn't what they think and Samantha tells them to let the doctor go, which they do. Dr. Tracer then explains about what is really going on and about the alien virus. He also mentions that if nothing is done about the virus, then all of Europe will get wiped out in 9 weeks. Michael then drives the dune buggy to the NASA lab, after Tracer mentions a canister that could provide a cure. On his way to the lab, Michael is confronted by a Fiat, which he successfully outruns.At the lab, Michael encounters the corpse of Captain Wells, and an alien that has unleashed itself from Wells' face. Michael manages to kill the alien and finds the canister. The lab alarm then goes into self-destruct mode, but despite losing the card key for the elevator, Michael successfully escapes from the lab with the canister before it explodes. While driving back in the village, Michael is confronted once again by the same Fiat that pursued him earlier. Once again, Michael successfully outdrives the Fiat, this time, causing it to flip over and explode. Arriving back to the camper, Tracer then develops the cure and applies it to the three teenagers. When the three hear the sounds of fighter jets, they suspect Dr. Tracer of trying to cover up the affair and have everyone killed. After that, Tracer reveals that he himself, is infected. Deciding that it is too late for him to inject himself with the cure, he runs out of the camper. Damon tries to convince the doctor that it isn't too late for him to be cured and to come with him, Michael and Samantha so that they can take him to the nearest hospital. The doctor tells Damon to escape from the village while he still can and is immediately run over by the garbage truck. Damon runs back into the camper and he, Michael and Samantha escape. The garbage truck is also in pursuit of our heroes but Damon manages to shoot a tire causing it to slow down. The three successfully drive out of the village alive after the air strike hits the village, destroying the garbage truck as well.While driving on the way to Madrid, the three teens decide to stop at a gas station to refuel the camper. At first, everything seems to be okay, until the gas station attendant coughs up blood and opens his jump suit to unleash a horrible alien from his face and chest cavity. Immediately, the alien leaps onto the camper window. The three teens attempt to escape, without any luck at first, but Damon then turns on the camper windshield to get the alien off the window and the camper eventually starts up. As the alien attempts to bite one of the camper's tires, Damon runs it over and the three move on. While Michael and Samantha are in the back of the camper and as Damon drives the camper into Madrid, Damon scratches his arm and his nose starts bleeding, indicating that he too, is now infected and that Dr. Tracer's supposed cure did not work. As the camper ascends into Madrid, the familiar sounds of an alien munching its way out of Damon's face can be heard. The movie ends there.By the time the end credits finish rolling, it can be presumed that the rest of Europe will be inevitably wiped out in 9 weeks, as Dr. Tracer predicted, and the rest of the world will follow through. It's also implied that Michael and Samantha are already infected too."

The boss, predicting that they'll all be starving soon, asks Pazu to shut off the boiler and oil the machinery, and goes home for the night.Dola has returned to her ship, but her sons are out searching for Sheeta in their flapters. One complains there's too much cloud cover and it's too dark, but Dola won't call off the search. She tells them to call her captain, and they reply ""yes, Mom,"" in unison.The Legend of the Castle in the SkyNext morning, Pazu wakes up at home&mdash;he slept on the floor&mdash;and sees Sheeta, still asleep in his bed. He climbs through a skylight to the roof and opens a window in a brick tower attached to his small wooden house, releasing some white doves. Then he climbs to the top of the tower and plays his trumpet. Pazu's house is perched on the lip of a cliff, and is part of a larger building that's mostly in ruins.The trumpet wakes Sheeta, who climbs the ladder to the roof, following the music. Pazu shakes her hand and introduces himself, then gives her some food to feed the doves. She's surprised to hear from Pazu that he found her floating in the air; she remembers being in an airship, but nothing more. Pazu has a theory about how she can float; he asks to see her necklace. She hands it to him and says her grandmother gave it to her and it's been in her family for generations. The crystal is blue with a gold symbol. Pazu puts on the necklace and jumps off the roof. He doesn't float. Sheeta finds him in a hole; he's broken through a terrace into his own basement. The room is set up as a workshop, with the wooden framework of a plane in the middle of the floor. When Pazu goes back upstairs to see to breakfast, Sheeta notices a photograph on the wall that looks like an island or a fortress surrounded by clouds. Its captioned ""Laputa.""Pazu finds her looking at the picture and says his father, who loved to fly, took it from an airship. He explains that most people think Laputa, the island that floats in the sky, is a legend. There's also a picture of Pazu's father's airship, and his journal, with drawings of the castle on the floating island. But nobody believed he'd seen it, and Pazu thinks that being called a liar killed his father. He says that as soon as he finishes building his plane, he'll prove that Laputa is real.Beware of the PiratesSheeta sees a car pull up outside, and Dola looks out. Sheeta backs away from the window while Pazu exclaims ""a real automobile! You don't see many of those around here!"" Sheeta says the people in the car are pirates, and they attacked her airship. The pirates are much better dressed than they were the night before and look quite respectable, but Pazu immediately accepts that they're pirates and they're after Sheeta.When the pirates come to the door, Pazu runs out, accompanied, apparently, by another boy. He stops when asked if he's seen a girl and says ""there are about 100 little girls in this town&mdash;which one?"" He and Sheeta run off as the second pirate, who went around and got in the back of the house, comes out holding Sheeta's bluish-purple dress and saying she must be in disguise now.On the village street, a pair of pirates in white suits are asking Pazu's boss about a little girl in pigtails and a purple dress. When he says he hasn't seen her, Pazu can be heard in the distance shouting ""Boss! Boss!"" As Pazu and Sheeta come running up the street, the pirate Shalulu (voice:Michael McShane) urges the boss to think harder, saying ""she would be about the age of those two."" Sheeta trips and falls, dislodging her borrowed cap and exposing her pigtails. The pirates try to grab her but Pazu and Sheeta take refuge behind the boss; Pazu tells him the men are pirates and they're after Sheeta. Pazu's boss turns out to be standing outside his own front door. As the pirates approach and threaten the boss, Sheeta, then Pazu are pulled inside and told by the boss's wife to run out the back door.Meanwhile at the front door, Shalulu, the beefiest pirate, tries to intimidate the boss by flexing his muscles and bursting out of his shirt. A crowd gathers, and the boss, who's pretty beefy himself, bursts his own buttons. His wife looks over his shoulder, frying pan at the ready, and remarks that she's not going to mend his now-shredded shirt. The two men fight. Soon the villagers in the street take exception to the other pirates' heckling and the fight become a melee.The car pulls up to the edge of a cliff, from which Dola and a couple more pirates can see the village street. ""Leave it to my little idiots to start a riot,"" she says. Then she spots Sheeta and Pazu running toward the railroad tracks. The kids jump on a moving train, tell the engineer (voice:Matt K. Miller) the Dola gang is after Sheeta, and ask to be dropped off at the police station in the next town. The engineer, who knows Pazu, asks no questions; all he says is ""help me stoke up the engine.""Dola drives through the village to extract Shalulu and his party of pugilists, who are astonished to hear that Sheeta has escaped. The villagers chase the car and throw things as it drives off; Dola throws them a hand grenade ""to remember us by.""The engineer spots the pirates' car approaching the moving train; he says the engine is old and can't go any faster. Dola drives the car onto the tracks and draws closer to the train in a hair-raising chase over rickety trestles. When they catch up, Pazu releases the empty cars behind the engine and the train pulls away, but the pirates' car is moving so fast it pushes the loose cars ahead of it and they quickly catch up with the laboring engine. Pazu cranks up the brakes on the lead car and it slows down, separating the pirates from the engine before they can grab Sheeta. As Pazu waves good-bye from the engine, Dola, sounding like the Wicked Witch of the West, says ""you'll get yours!""The pirates heave a train car off the tracks, but pause as they're trying to jettison the second one because Dola notices a military spy plane, which she thinks is Muska.Meanwhile, the engineer stops because there's an army engine coming toward him. He cheerfully says ""it's the army to the rescue!"" and asks for help for the kids, but Sheeta quickly realizes that the men coming from the military engine look just like the ones who were working with Muska. She says ""good-bye, Pazu,"" and takes off, bad guys in pursuit. Pazu trips them before running after Sheeta. The quick-witted engineer scalds the bad guys with his steam-powered brakes when they try to shoot the fleeing kids.The kids almost immediately see the Dola gang coming at them; they're still on a trestle, but Sheeta runs down a siding, telling Pazu not to follow her or he'll get hurt. The Dola gang catches up to them, destroying the trestle as they approach. Pazu and Sheeta jump off and dangle precariously as the gang's train car passes over them. Dola watches Sheeta and Pazu fall toward the town below and then, with a flash of light, they float back up as Sheeta's crystal saves them.Pazu tells Sheeta, ""this is what happened the first time I saw you&mdash;I knew there was something special about that necklace."" Dola isn't surprised and tells her sons, ""it's the power of the crystal."" The soldiers from the armored train can see the kids too. They float gently down into a mineshaft.The pirates go after them, while overhead, the spy plane watches.Lost in the MineSheeta's crystal, which has been glowing, goes dark when they land at the bottom of the shaft, but Pazu has a lantern. They walk for a bit in the old mine, then sit down to eat. (Pazu is still carrying the fried egg on toast he made for breakfast.) Asked where she's from, Sheeta says ""I come from Gondoa, deep in the northern mountains."" After her parents died, she cared for their farm animals until some men came and took her away&mdash;the same men in dark glasses who are now pursuing her.Pazu realizes that the men and Dola are both after the crystal, which Sheeta didn't realize was so powerful. She says her mother gave it to her before she died, and told her never to show it or give it away to anyone. Pazu says ""we orphans should stick together."" Sheeta apologizes for getting him mixed up in her problems, but Pazu isn't sorry at all: ""this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me!""The children are frightened when they hear someone approaching, but it's an old miner friend of Pazu's, Uncle Pom (voice:Richard Dysart). They tell him there are pirates chasing them and the army is right behind the pirates, and Uncle Pom thinks that sounds splendid. He takes them to his camp by an underground lake and gives them tea. He says that the rocks speak to him, and they've been restless since last night. Then he blows out the lamp, leaving them in the silent darkness.It doesn't stay dark long. Soon crystals on the floor, ceiling, and walls around them start to glow. Pazu wonders what's doing that, and Uncle Pom cracks open a rock to show him; it briefly glows. He says ""it's a long-forgotten element called aetherium. People no longer know how to mine aetherium."" Sheeta pulls out her crystal, which is glowing. The old man says ""that's a pure aetherium crystal!"" Pom tells them such crystals haven't existed since his great-grandfather's time; according to legend, only the people of the floating city of Laputa knew how to make them. It's aetherium that makes Laputa float. After a few minutes Uncle Pom is overcome and asks Sheeta to put the crystal away&mdash;""it's speaking too loudly to me, too sadly.""Uncle Pom's great-grandfather told him that the rocks become restless when Laputa appears over the mine. He tells Sheeta that the crystal's power comes from the earth, and to use it selfishly will bring great unhappiness.Outside, the military spy plane flies off and the disheveled pirates, who are peeking out of the mine, ask Dola if they can go back to the ship. She says it's too quiet; they decide to sit tight.The kids say goodbye to Uncle Pom at another entrance to the mine.CapturedOnce outdoors, Pazu and Sheeta climb a steep hill and stop to admire a huge cloud. Pazu is sure the cloud is hiding Laputa. Sheeta says she hasn't told him the traditional name her family gave her: Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa. While they're talking, a plane spots them and lands nearby; they're captured by army men in green uniforms and a man in a dark suit and dark glasses, who knocks Pazu out with the butt of his pistol. Muska disembarks from the plane and growls ""and about time!"" when told they've been captured.Pazu comes to in a bare cell in a coastal fortress. He hears soldiers drilling outside his arrow-slit window, but can't see them.In a room above, Muska tells a portly general (voice:Jim Cummings) that they'll get what they want, but it will take time. The general responds that they're wasting time; Muska should twist an arm or two and the girl will talk. Muska says military tactics risk wasting more time. The general says military tactics would have saved them from Dola's interference, but Muska replies, ""it was a military transmission that the pirates decoded."" He says the general's job is to mobilize the troops when the time comes. The general says he's in charge of finding Laputa; Muska counters that as the government's secret agent, he's in charge of the general.Sheeta huddles on a window seat in a sunny tower room. Muska walks in and picks up a dress, remarking that it's fit for a princess. Sheeta asks if Pazu's all right and asks to see him. ""Your friend is being treated as if he were the guest of royalty,"" he says.He takes her down in an elevator to show her a battered, broken giant robot. ""Laputa was just a legend until this dropped from the sky."" Muska explains that his job is to figure out the robot's&mdash;Laputa's&mdash;secrets. He points out a small red shield on the robot's chest; it bears the same symbol as Sheeta's crystal. He needs her help to get the crystal to lead them to Laputa. Sheeta tells him to keep the crystal and take Laputa's treasures for himself. Muska, trying to convince her that it's not about the money, says Laputa used to dominate the world, and it's still dangerous. And the stone only works for her. Sheeta just wants to see Pazu. Muska says if she'll cooperate, she can help free Pazu. If she won't, he can't control what the military might do to him. Then Muska calls her by her real name, Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa. ""Toel means ruler in Laputian; Ul means true. You are the legitimate heir to the throne of Laputa, Princess Lusheeta."" Sheeta is stunned.A Broken PromisePazu, meanwhile, is climbing the walls of his cell when a soldier comes to let him out to see Sheeta and Muska. Muska says there's been a misunderstanding; they had no idea how bravely he fought to defend Sheeta from the pirates. Pazu is confused, and still more confused when Sheeta tells him to forget about Laputa. Muska says Sheeta has agreed to help the army search (secretly) for Laputa, and Pazu really should forget about it. Pazu objects, but Sheeta leaves. Muska gives Pazu several gold coins ""to show our appreciation of your efforts."" Pazu walks out of the fortress. As Sheeta watches him go from her window, Muska fastens the crystal around her neck and tells her to remember the words that bring the crystal to life. ""Keep your promise and you too will be free.""In the mining village, it's evening. A small child with a broom chases a pig out of her house. She see Pazu walking slowly up the street and calls her mother, the boss's wife, who comes out to say they've all been worried, and where has he been and what happened to his friend? Pazu only says ""it's over now,"" and runs off. He comes to his own front door and finds the pirates making themselves at home. They discover the gold in his pocket and accuse him of selling Sheeta out; he replies that he only left because Sheeta told him to. ""So you believed her and you came back here?"" sneers Dola. Dola suggests that the army forced Sheeta to make a deal to save Pazu's life, and they're not likely to keep Sheeta alive once they get what they want.A telegraph receiver on the table comes to life. Dola translates the Morse code: ""They're calling for air destroyer Goliath. They're about to take off with Sheeta. We've got to hurry or it will be too late!""Pazu begs to come with them. Dola agrees, thinking he'll be useful in getting Sheeta to cooperate. He grabs his father's aviator headgear, complete with goggles, and opens the dovecote so his birds can get out and feed themselves while he's gone. The pirates take off in their flapters, Pazu riding with Dola.The huge airship Goliath arrives at the fortress as Muska and the general watch. The general asks if the girl has surrendered the information yet; Muska says it will take a little more time. The general says they'll have plenty of time aboard Goliath, and they'll depart at first light.The RescueThe pirates buzz through the night in their flapters. Dola urges them to hurry as they have to get there before sun-up. Pazu thinks of Sheeta.Sheeta's looking out at the night and remembering a time when her grandmother taught her a spell that would help her if she was ever in trouble. Sheeta learned the words in Laputian; in English, they mean ""Save me and revive the eternal light."" She recites the Laputian, and her crystal lights up and emits so much energy that she cries out in distress and tries to cover her eyes. Far below, the robot is activated and its broken parts move together. Muska comes into her room, saying ""the sacred light! The ancient documents were true&mdash;it's not just a legend!""He reaches for the glowing crystal but it seems to hurt him. He pulls his hand back but demands that she tell him the spell. The soldiers guarding the robot think they hear something and open its door, which it blocks when they try to close it again. They get on the phone to say the robot is alive. It bursts out of its prison; at the same moment, the crystal goes dark. When Sheeta and Muska come out of her room, they see the robot climbing the stairs toward them. The soldiers shoot at it, doing no damage, then shut the fire door at the top of the stairs. The robot melts it. Muska is amazed at the robot's power. He realizes the crystal has brought it to life. The robot uses a laser to cut the wooden walkway where Muska, Sheeta, and others are standing; the pieces separate, leaving Sheeta alone on one side. The robot unfurls its wings, flies up the inside of the tower, and follows the terrified Sheeta up the stairs at the top. On the roof of the tower, her crystal flashes again and points through the clouds&mdash;at Laputa, she and Muska both believe, but we can't see it. The robot breaks through the roof of the tower as the soldiers bring their artillery to bear on it. The robot communes with the crystal for a moment before it's hit by a shell and falls. The soldiers try to revive Sheeta, who groans, and then the robot comes back to life. It picks her up and starts shooting with its laser eye. It does a lot of damage to the fortress, leaving much of it in flames, and starts setting fire to the surrounding countryside.From their flapters, the pirates see the fortress lit up in the distance. The sun is beginning to rise. When Sheeta comes to, she tells the robot to stop, climbing up to sit on its shoulder. But by then everything around them is burning.Pazu has spotted them, though, and directs Dola to the top of the tower. In trying to get close enough to grab her, they clip the tower; Dola is knocked out and the flapter plummets toward the water below until, at the last moment, Pazu gets to the controls and pulls out of the dive. Dola recovers and they make another attempt to get Sheeta. The robot, which seems to be in some kind of trouble itself&mdash;burning out from within&mdash;has put Sheeta on the battlements of the tower. Muska sees what they're up to just as Pazu, hanging upside-down from the flapter, grabs Sheeta. ""It's not over,"" Muska promises himself as the pirates fly off.An Adventurous TripAs the general expresses his anger over the loss of Sheeta and the robot and orders a pursuit, one of Muska's men draws Muska away: ""I think we may have found what you've been looking for."" Muska finds Sheeta's crystal on the ground near the tower, still pointing to Laputa. He's able to pick it up. He sends a message to the general that they'll be departing on time.Sheeta cries on Pazu's shoulder as the pirates fly them toward Pazu's home. Dola is annoyed because Sheeta lost the crystal. Pazu asks if they can sail with the pirates. They say they'll work, and Sheeta says she needs to find out about Laputa for herself. They fly over Pazu's house but keep going and rejoin the pirates' airship, the Tiger Moth. One of Dolas sons takes Pazu to the engine room and introduces Pazu to his father, a short bald man with a huge mustache. He's the ship's engineer, and he needs an assistant. Pazu immediately shows his mechanical ability. After conferring with Sheeta about the location of Laputa, Dola announces that Goliath is heading for Laputa and they're going after her. The first to spot Laputa will get 10 gold coins.Dola takes Sheeta in hand, telling her she has to start talking like a pirate (Sheeta's ""shiver me timbers"" is not convincing) and dressing like a pirate (Dola gives her an enormous pair of pink pants). And Sheeta has to clean up the filthy galley (which is piled high with dirty dishes, pots, and pans) so she can start producing the five meals a day the hungry pirates require. Dola gives her an hour. When Dola opens the galley door, most of her sons fall into the room&mdash;they've been outside listening.Later, as Pazu hangs on the hull of the airship hammering at something, one of Dola's sons peers through the galley porthole at Sheeta, who's making soup. He goes in and offers to help. It turns out that several of his brothers are already there with the same idea.In the captain's quarters, Dola and her husband are playing chess. He remarks that its not usual for her to challenge a ship like Goliath. He says the kids are cute, and the little girl reminds him of Dola. Cut to the crew, eating hungrily and asking Sheeta for seconds.That night, one of the sons comes to wake Pazu, who's sleeping on the floor under some bunks; its Pazu's turn to stand watch. The pirate gives Pazu a brown poncho, remarking that it's cold, and sends him up the ladder on the outside of the ship to the crow's nest at the top of the hull. Sheeta, who's been sleeping on Dola's floor, gets up and follows him. She's almost blown away as she climbs into the crow's nest. They talk a bit and Pazu throws the poncho over her, so they're both in it at once. Dola is awake and can hear them through a speaking tube. Sheeta confesses that she's afraid of going to Laputa; she doesn't want anyone else to get hurt. She feels awful about the robot, which died to save her. As Dola listens, Sheeta talks about the spells her grandmother taught her&mdash;not just the one that revived the robot, but a spell to find things, a spell to cure sickness, and a spell of destruction, which her grandmother told her never to use. (To give power to good spells, she had to know evil ones too.) But she never knew the spells were connected to her necklace. She worries that Laputa has the same power as the necklace, and poses the same danger if the power is misused.Pazu argues that even if she'd thrown the crystal away and they'd never met, sooner or later someone would have managed to land on Laputa and claim it. They can't let it fall into the hands of people like Muska. If they run away, Muska will chase them forever. Sheeta feels bad that Pazu is becoming a pirate; he says he isn't going to become a pirate, and Dola will understand&mdash;""she's much nicer than she pretends to be."" He promises that after they find Laputa, they'll go to Gondoa and see her old home. Then they spot Goliath, a shadow in the clouds beneath them, and raise the alarm.Something's WrongDola orders a change of course, but Goliath breaks through the clouds and starts shooting at them. Tiger Moth quickly descends into the cloud layer; they get away without much damage, and Goliath doesn't pursue.On Goliath's bridge, the general argues for chasing the Tiger Moth. Colonel Muska won't let him, saying it's a waste of energy. He has Sheeta's crystal on the compass, still directing him to Laputa.On Tiger Moth's bridge, Dola calls up to Pazu through the speaking tube. She says they can't lose Goliath, so Pazu must keep her in sight. To do that, he'll have to release the crow's nest from its moorings on the hull; it remains attached by a cable and flies like a kite. She explains how to release it and open the wings, then tells Sheeta to come down because flying the kite is man's work. Sheeta points out that Dola is female, and that she, Sheeta, grew up in the mountains, and she can handle this. Dola, laughing, gives in and says once they take off they'll need to use the phone to communicate. Dola's phone immediately rings; when she picks it up, Sheeta's voice says ""you mean this phone?""Pazu releases the kite. The ride is peaceful except when the wind gusts. They can't see Goliath, but Pazu does see a storm coming. As a precaution against the storm, Pazu tells Sheeta to get rope out of his bag and tie them together. On the bridge, the pirates note that the mercury is dropping fast and it's an hour to sunrise. When the sun comes up, Pazu and Sheeta notice that it's in the wrong place&mdash;or more accurately, they're flying in the wrong direction: east, not north. The bridge reports that something is confusing the compass, which is pointing east. Sheeta sees the cloud that covers Laputa, heading right for them. Dola, realizing it's also a hurricane, orders the engines to reverse, but the Tiger Moth is already caught in the winds. When Goliath appears above them, they're sitting ducks.Pazu and Sheeta in the kite and Muska aboard Goliath are determined to get through the storm to Laputa. The kite passes through an electrical field into a weird zone where for a moment Pazu catches site of a familiar ghostly airship, and recognizes the pilot&mdash;his father. Then they break into relatively clear air over Laputa. They're still trailing their cable, but its not attached to the Tiger Moth any more. It drags among the vegetation on Laputa, slowing them down so they come to a softer landing than they might otherwise have done, but it's not gentle. Pazu and Sheeta are knocked out when they land and fall out of the kite.The Wonder of a New PlaceAs they lie there, the fog and clouds disperse. They come to on a sunny, flowery lawn at the top of a tower, still tied together. Thrilled at finally being on Laputa, they laugh and hug each other and twirl exuberantly. They can see old stone structures that look a little the worse for wear, and a huge tree that seems to be the center of the island. A giant robot shows up and picks up their kite. Sheeta thinks it can't know who she is as she doesn't have the aetherium crystal, but she asks it not to take the kite as they need it to get home. The robot pauses and seems to register her remarks, but moves the kite anyway. There's a bird's nest underneath it, holding three eggs. The robot puts the kite down nearby and flashes and burbles at them, which Sheeta understands to mean they should follow. The robot leads them across a bridge, where they see some small animals dive into an ornamental pool. But when they peer into the water, they can see a city down there. The robot is still walking. They run to catch up; it leads them to an enormous garden. The garden is enclosed in nearly invisible walls; at the center is a giant tree that Pazu guesses is a thousand years old. There's some stonework scattered around, and some inside the tree. They see another robot and realize it's not the one they followed; this one is dead and seems to have been frozen in place for a very long time. Looking more closely at the roots of the tree, then can see that they're littered with dead, moss-covered robots.On a flat stone that looks like a grave marker, someone has laid a row of pink flowers. Their robot comes back holding another pink flower, which Sheeta takes with thanks. Some striped animals that look like a cross between cats and squirrels appear on the robot's shoulders and chase each other around its neck. The robot looks at them and goes about its business. The kids think it's probably the only working robot left.In the underground part of the city, a detonator triggers an explosion. It disturbs birds and is followed by several smaller explosions&mdash;or aftershocks. Pazu and Sheeta run off to find the source of the disturbance. They find a section of the city that's been destroyed&mdash;Pazu attributes that to the army.The InvasionSheeta and Pazu spot Goliath, moored at the edge of a large plaza and disgorging crowds of soldiers from two gangplanks. Beside it are the ruins of the Tiger Moth. Sheeta worries about Dola and the boys; Pazu sees that they've been captured. They know the pirates will be hanged if they can't help them escape.
A soldier brings the general a heavy, jeweled necklace; he reports they've broken through the wall and the city is full of treasure. The general taunts the pirates with the necklace and tells Muska to send a radio message about their discovery of the city, adding snidely, ""see if you can make it difficult to decode."" He runs off to keep his underlings from pocketing any jewels, and Muska smugly observes that the jewels have thrown ""those fools off the scent.""Pazu has a plan. He and Sheeta climb down the roots of the giant tree toward Goliath. They peer through a high window into a huge chamber where soldiers are rushing to and fro, grabbing treasure and taking it outside. But there's shooting going on as the looters work. Some other soldiers break through a door, enter the chamber, and fight with the looters. Sheeta says they can't let the soldiers ruin the garden too. Pazu says they have to find the aetherium crystal to protect the garden, then notes that all the storm clouds around Laputa have disappeared. If that hadn't happened, the army wouldn't have been able to land. Pazu thinks they used Sheeta's crystal to dispel the storm, and resolves to prevent Muska from learning to use the crystal. Sheeta realizes that the spell of destruction might be the only way to do that. Just then they hear soldiers nearby, looking for them. They sneak off among the tree-roots.The kids climb down near the Tiger Moth, staying out of sight as much as they can. At the broken foot of an arcade below the plaza where the ruined Tiger Moth and her crew are being held, Pazu has to jump from one pier to the next. But the pier he jumps to crumbles as he climbs. While he struggles to hang on, Muska and two of his men emerge on the walkway Sheeta and Pazu were on a minute before; they're looking for a door. Sheeta is just a few yards away hiding in a niche, and Pazu is in full view behind the men, trying to reach a window. Muska, consulting a little blue book, finds the hidden door and uses Sheeta's crystal to open it. They turn around when they hear Pazu knocking loose another chunk of masonry and one of Muska's henchmen takes a shot at him as he reaches the window. Sheeta rushes them, knocks one over, and tries to run, but Muska catches her by a pigtail. Pazu, too far away to help, shouts at them not to hurt Sheeta. The henchmen shoot again and a bullet grazes Pazu's cheek; he disappears inside as the soldiers on the plaza above him look down. Muska tells them he's caught another pirate, and there's one more under their feet. Pazu shouts to Sheeta that he'll find her. Muska and his party go through the secret door with Sheeta in tow; the opening disappears behind them.The soldiers above Pazu throw a hand grenade through his window; when it goes off, the smoke comes up through the paving stones the pirates are sitting on. Dola pushes a brick down into the hollow space below her. When the soldiers run off, Pazu looks up through the hole. He says he's going to rescue Sheeta, but first he cuts Dola's ropes first and passes her his knife. In return, Dola shakes a large, wide-mouthed handgun and a couple of shells out of her pant leg, so Pazu is armed. In the treasure chamber, the general's men report that Muska destroyed all the radios, and that Muska and his two men were seen heading for the black dome (an inverted dome under the island that presumably houses the tech keeping it afloat). The general orders his men to arrest Colonel Muska. Pazu watches them march off.Muska, Sheeta, and Muska's two henchmen descend into the black dome on an elevator platform. They pass through a shaft made of black stone blocks carved with geometric designs. When they reach the bottom, Muska leaves his protesting men behind, saying only royalty is allowed to enter the central chamber. He and Sheeta descend a little further and enter a chamber that's been infiltrated by tree roots. Muska is angry, saying the roots don't belong there and he'll have them burned. He checks his little blue book again and directs Sheeta down a corridor, also lined with tree roots. Muska pulls some roots aside to expose a door, which glows and opens when he holds the crystal against it. Inside is a bright sort of garden, walled with tree roots, lit by a glowing ball of tree roots at the center, and full of tall plants that reach Muska's shoulders. He's furious at finding more roots and plants here. He pushes through the roots surrounding the glow in the center and reveals a large, blue rotating octahedron. He exults that at last he's found the largest aetherium crystal ever&mdash;Laputa's power source.Muska says the stone has been awaiting the return of its king for 700 years. Looking at his book again, he wades through the plants and finds a slant-topped black stone like a podium, with writing on the slanted surface. Batting aside a cloud of gnats, Muska checks the black stone's inscription against his book and says they're the same. Sheeta asks him who he is, and he says he, too, has an old, secret name: Romska Polo Ul Laputa. He says he and Sheeta share royal ancestors, but their ancestors left Laputa to live on Earth, which Muska considers a mistake.As Pazu clings to a tree root on the outer surface of the black dome, there's an explosion. The soldiers who set off the explosion run to the site of the blast&mdash;they seem to be trying to open Muska's hidden door&mdash;and find that the stone is singed but undamaged. The general is ordering them to try again using all the dynamite they have when Muska's voice over a PA system says there's no need to do that; they may come in. Muska moves Sheeta's crystal over the surface of the black podium stone. Some symbols light up and the big carved black blocks in the central shaft move out of the walls of their own accord and rearrange themselves. Muska's two men, who have been trying to climb out, are knocked loose. They scream and fall. The black dome rumbles and shakes, then starts to open. The vine Pazu is clinging to breaks loose at the top and he falls with it, hollering. It swings and he's able to grab another vine that's still attached. A panel opens above him and a huge stone column that looks like a jet emerges; we can see that there are seven of them arranged in a circle near the bottom of the black dome. Pazu scrambles away.The general and his soldiers are invited to walk through a door Muska has caused to open for them. They still can't see him. A room like a viewing platform opens at the bottom of the dome and the general and the soldiers go in. Pazu can see what's happening from the outside. Muska projects images of himself and Sheeta into the room and announces to the soldiers that they're in the presence of the king of Laputa. He demonstrates the power of the reborn kingdom of Laputa by creating a sort of bomb with the seven giant jets and dropping it through the clouds. They can't see where it falls, but they see the top of its fiery mushroom cloud. ""The fire of heaven that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament!"" gloats Muska. ""The Rhamaniya referred to it as Indra's Arrow. The entire world will once again kneel before the power of Laputa!""The general changes his tone: ""Well done, Muska! You're a credit to our country. As such, you deserve this reward!""He shoots at the projection of Muska, which has no effect except to make Muska sneer at his stupidity. Muska reaches for the black stone; Sheeta bites his hand and tells them to run. Some do, but the general and many soldiers are still standing there when the floor is pulled out from under them. As they fall, Muska laughs and his projection disappears into the ceiling.Surviving soldiers run through corridors in the dome. They pass giant robots coming to life and emerging on all fours from niches in the walls. When the robots get outside, the pirates spot them and decide to run for it in their flapters, which are undamaged inside the wreck of the Tiger Moth. The soldiers are rushing back aboard Goliath, but it pulls away before everyone has boarded, sending those on the gangplanks to their deaths.Once her crew is aboard the flapters, Dola is reluctant to leave without Pazu and Sheeta. In the aetherium crystal's garden chamber, Muska throws Sheeta to the ground and tells her she'd better be gracious to the new king, as she'll be spending a lot of time with him. He uses the black podium to call up an image of Goliath, which is shooting at Laputa. He scoffs that the fools don't understand that it's useless to fight him.Goliath's artillery knocks Pazu from his vine on the underside of the dome. He gets a toehold at the lip of a chute that disgorges a stream of flying robots, which attack Goliath. Once the robots are away, Pazu takes off his shoes and climbs up the chute. At the top of the chute he finds a space filled with gears and other mechanisms; he keeps climbing and shouts for Sheeta.Outside, the robots are destroying Goliath; Muska watches and gloats while Sheeta tells him to leave Goliath alone. She gets loose (her hands have been tied since Muska caught her at the secret door) and rushes Muska, demanding her crystal. She grabs it and runs. She pounds on the door of the garden chamber while Muska strolls over, telling her to be good and give the crystal back. The door disappears before he reaches her&mdash;her crystal lights up&mdash;and she runs again. Muska, still unconcerned and unhurried, continues to follow her. He tells her that no one can hear her, and only he can help her.Pazu uses Dola's gun to make a hole in a wall. He scrambles through and runs, still shouting for Sheeta. Finally Sheeta hears him and runs toward his voice. Just before Muska catches up, Sheeta passes her crystal to Pazu through a tiny opening; she tells Pazu to throw it in the ocean. Muska has a revolver. He tries to shoot Pazu through the chink, then warns him to protect the crystal if he wants to see the girl alive. Pazu blasts a bigger hole in the wall, crawls through, and runs after them.RedemptionSheeta runs into an empty room; Muska follows and shoots. She drops and he tells her to get up, which she does. ""How appropriate that we've ended up in the throne room,"" he remarks.Facing him across the floor, Sheeta answers that it's no longer a throne room&mdash;now it's their tomb. A king without compassion does not deserve a kingdom, she tells him. She recites the words to a song from her home valley of Gondoa: ""Take root in the ground, live in harmony with the wind, plant your seeds in the winter, and rejoice with the birds in the coming of spring."" No matter how many weapons you have, the world cannot live without love. He aims at her again and shoots off one of her pigtails; she barely flinches. He insists that he'll return Laputa to life, that its power is the dream of all mankind. He shoots off her other pigtail and says ""your ears are next unless you get on your knees and obey me. Give me that stone!""Pazu arrives and tells Muska he's hidden the stone. Muska says he'll kill Sheeta if Pazu doesn't produce the stone. Pazu responds that Muska can have the stone if Pazu can talk to Sheeta. Throughout this exchange, Sheeta implores Pazu to take the stone and run. Muska gives them a minute to decide what to do. Pazu embraces Sheeta and asks her to whisper the spell of destruction in his ear so they can say it together. ""Put your hand in mine and trust me,"" he says, showing her the crystal in his hand. He tells her Dola and the boys are free, so she doesn't need to worry about them. When Muska says their time is up, Pazu throws down his gun. They hold out their clasped hands and say a single word, ""Balus.""The big crystal flashes, as does the small one in their hands, dazzling them and Muska, who screams. The big crystal falls, breaking through its enclosure, and Laputa begins to disintegrate. Muska, blinded, stumbles around screaming ""no!"" The pirates finally shove off in their flapters but hover nearby to watch Laputa fall apart. Under the island, it rains masonry and broken robots. Dola realizes Sheeta and Pazu used the spell of destruction to save Laputa from Muska.One of the pirates sees a blue light among the roots of Laputa's central tree. The spell doesn't seem to affect the central tree and the structure most closely attached to it (the garden?)&mdash;or the giant aetherium crystal. Once it has shed the black dome and most of the buildings, the tree floats off, the pale blue crystal glowing through its roots.Sheeta wakes up among the roots of the tree with Pazu. Sheeta says they survived because they protected the tree, and it protected them in return. They find their kite, which looks intact. They climb aboard and take a last flight around Laputa. They see the last robot still tending the garden.When they leave Laputa behind, the kids soon encounter the convoy of pirates in their overloaded flapters. The pirates are overjoyed to see them alive. Dola's husband, the Tiger Moth's engineer, mourns the loss of their airship, and Dola, calling him a big baby, promises to buy him another one. Which it turns out they can easily afford&mdash;every pirate shows off jewelry worth a fortune. Pazu and Sheeta don't stay with the pirates, though; they get back in the kite and fly off into the clouds together. Perhaps they're heading north, for Gondoa."
Chopping Mall,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090837/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of young shopping mall employees stay behind for a late night party in one of the stores. When the mall goes on lock-down before they can get out, the robot security system malfunctions, and goes on a killing spree. The Park Plaza 2000 Shopping Center is implementing a new nighttime security system developed and monitored by Secure-tronics. While part of that system is fortifying the interior with impenetrable doors timed to be secured from midnight to 6AM, the core of the system is three 101 series Protector robots who are programmed to neutralize any non-authorized personnel until the police arrive. On the first night of this new system, eight (four pairs) of the younger shopping center employees are secretly planning on an after hours party at the home furnishings store in the mall, so chosen for the beds and couches for more intimate pursuits. Set up on a blind date, Ferdy Meisel and Alison Parks are the two somewhat reluctant attendees, mild-mannered Ferdy worried about the state of the store after the fact, it where he works, and proverbial girl next door Alison, who has only worked at the mall for a week, not knowing anyone at the party besides her coworker Suzie Lynn. Their party takes a turn when the robots begin to malfunction and decide that their collective mission is to kill anyone in their way. Making the situation worse for the eight is that they are caught inside the shopping center after midnight meaning they are trapped with the killer and seemingly indestructible robots at least until morning, that is if they survive until then. Complicating matters is that they are surrounded within a mall full of merchandise which may work for or against them.—Huggo A group of teenagers that work at the mall all get together for a late night party in one of the stores. When the mall goes on lockdown before they can get out, the robot security system malfunctions and goes on a killing spree. One by one, the three bots try to rid the mall of the ""intruders."" The only weapons the kids can use are the supplies in other stores. Or . . . if they can make it 'til morning when the mall reopens.—Lindsey Wilhite (amity1382@msn.com) with punctuation corrections by Brx Park Plaza Mall has just installed a state-of-the-art security system, which includes security shutters across all exits, and three high-tech security robots, programmed to disable (using tasers and tranquilliser guns) and apprehend would-be thieves.
Four couples (Married pair Rick and Linda, Greg and Suzie, Mike and Leslie, and Ferdy and Allison) decide to have a party in one of the furniture stores where three of them work. They all stay after hours at the mall, drinking, partying, and eventually three of the couples have sex in the furniture store beds, while the fourth couple, Alison and Ferdy, who were introduced by Greg and Suzie, watch old science fiction films on TV.Outside, a lightning storm strikes the mall several times and damages the computer controlling the security robots, which kill their technicians and a janitor, before going on regular patrol in the now empty mall. Two of the teens (Mike and Leslie) leave the furniture store to buy cigarettes, and are subsequently killed by the robots - now the ""killbots"" of the movies original title. The surviving teens witness the killbots kill Leslie, and the men and women are forced to separate, the men into the mall and the women into the air ducts, when the killbots begin their attack.The men break into a sporting goods store (""Peckinpah's"") to arm themselves with guns, whilst the girls take gas and flares from an automotive store after Suzie has a panic attack and leaves the air ducts to help Greg, with Allison and Linda following her, not wanting to leave her in the mall alone.Utilizing a propane tank, Rick, Greg, and Ferdy blow-up and appear to destroy one of the killbots (Though it later recovers). Rick, Greg and Ferdy then rig the mall elevator with a booby trap. A second killbot ambushes the women while the men finish rigging the elevator, and Suzie's screams alert the men that the women are in trouble. They rush to help, but are too late. Suzie is killed as the killbot utilizes its laser, setting fire to her gas can and setting her aflame, while Greg watches in horror. He tries unsuccessfully to shoot the killbot, before Rick drags him away.The teens, now regrouped, are able to destroy a killbot by luring it into the booby-trapped elevator. They then hide out in the restaurant where Allison works. Greg confronts Allison and Linda about leaving the air ducts, which led to Suzie's death. Greg also exhibits signs that he's beginning to crack. The girls try to explain, but Greg has difficulty accepting their explanation, going so far as to pull his gun on Ferdy when he intercedes on Allison and Linda's behalf. Rick manages to calm him down, and Ferdy suggests destroying the main control centre for the killbots, thinking that it will shut them down. Greg and the others support the idea. They begin to make their way to level 3 of the mall where the killbots' control centre is located.Greg, continuing to behave recklessly over Suzie, and despite the others trying to get him under control, gets too far ahead of them and is killed when one of the remaining killbots ambushes him and throws him over the balcony, where he falls to his death three floors below. While on the run, the remaining teens see the killbot that was believed to be destroyed and realize there are still two left to deal with. The final four, Allison, Ferdy, Rick, and Linda take refuge in a department store as the remaining two killbots work to gain access.Hearing one of the killbots gain entrance in the store's lower level, The group sets up store dummies and mirrors in an attempt to confuse the killbot waiting outside the upper-level door, then open it up. The plan works, and when the killbot starts firing at the dummies, one of its lasers reflects back off of a mirror, hitting the killbot and setting it firing blindly. Linda is killed when one of the lasers hits her, and Rick, enraged, drives a store golfcart into the killbot, firing wildly. He is electrocuted by a bolt of electricity, but his actions finally destroy the second killbot completely.Their deaths leave Alison and Ferdy as the only two survivors to search for the control centre in the storage areas of the mall. The third and final killbot corners Alison who is rescued when Ferdy shoots it point blank, damaging its laser, and setting himself up as a target instead - the killbot strikes and appears to kill him as Alison escapes.
Alison falls to the lower mall injuring her leg, and sets another trap for the killbot in a paint store, by mixing paint and chemicals from the shelves. She goads the killbot into the store where it becomes stuck - its tracks unable to find traction on the spilled paint and thinners - and throws the flare into the store where the volatile chemicals explode, destroying the final killbot. As she leaves the store, she hears Ferdy call her from the upper mall, revealing that he was still alive. The film ends with Alison and Ferdy together as the mall is now at daytime, showing that Alison and Ferdy survived the night massacre.After the credits roll, a killbot shows and says ""Thank you, have a nice day"" as then it cuts to black"

They are kind, they look like an old-fashioned marriage and they prepare dinner.There are three more people who appear that night at the mansion: two hitchhikers, Enid (Cassie Stuart) and Isabel Prange (Bunty Bailey), who are a kind of punk best friends - Isabel has the look of Madonna in her  Who's That Girl? phase - and the childish man who pick them up, a kind young man called Ralph Morris (Stephen Lee).

He has even heard Mr Punch speak to him directly. Although he panics at the beginning and he's attacked by the dolls, they accept that he's still a child at heart, so they won't hurt him. As soon as he realises that the dolls won't hurt Jody, he stops destroying the dolls.Meanwhile, Enid is attacked by the alive dolls. She manages to burn many of them, but they are too many, attacking from all directions at once, so she is eventually killed as well.Ralph has become such a friend of the dolls, that he won't use one to defend himself when David attacks him in a rage.

California, 1980Veteran photojournalist Richard Boyle (James Woods) has been taking his camera to the world's trouble spots for over 20 years.

One morning, he finds that his wife has abandoned him, taking their child with her. Broke and with no immediate prospects, Boyle and his best friend, Doctor Rock (Jim Belushi), an out-of-work disc jockey, head to El Salvador, where Boyle is convinced that he can scrounge some lucrative freelance work amidst the nation's political turmoil.

Jessica returns to the house to her prisoner's ""kennel"", where she unties Simpson and tells him that he is free to go.Jessica goes back upstairs to her bedroom, strips off all her clothes, and lies down on her bed, putting the pistol to her head intending to kill herself. Seconds later, the besotted Simpson walks willingly into her bedroom and prevents her from committing suicide by having sex with her as both of them are now drawn into a torrid passion of their own making.

Hamburger: The Motion Picture,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091165/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Russell Proco has been expelled from several schools for lewd, crude and nude conduct. Busterburger University is his last chance for an education and pleasing his disappointed parents. Russell Proco has a grudge: every university he attends expels him for getting too friendly with the congenial coeds. And if he does not receive a college diploma soon, he will be removed from the massive trust fund promised by his parents. Russell's only hope for the massive trust fund is to stop going astray. And there's no better place for him than Busterburger University - where they provide an education on how to manage a Busterburger franchise. All Russell has to do to graduate and receive the diploma he hungers for, is to keep out of trouble. And keep away from the girls. And for this footloose, would-be grill king, that's no short order.—Anonymous Russell Proco (Leigh McCloskey) has been expelled from multiple schools because of his crude behavior, mainly his Lothario ways in having women throw themselves at him (even when he is in no mood). He was given a massive trust fund, but his grandfather's will stipulated that the trust find is frozen unless he earns a college diploma. While trying to mull his problem at a local Busterburger (while having to say no to the overly friendly attractive cashier) owned by a friend of his, who said he had a similar problem and that he earned the equivalent of a college diploma after finishing Busterburger University. Russell agrees that this may be his way to have the trust fund unfrozen.After signing up, Russell runs afoul of Drootin (Dick Butkus), a vicious teacher whose job is to ensure that improper franchise owners will flunk out. Drootin imposes three rules on all the candidates: (1) Outside consumption of food is prohibited. (2) All candidates are to remain on the grounds of Busterburger University until graduation. (3) Since sex and success make lousy partners, all candidates are not to engage in sex while students.Russell tries to focus on work and to steer clear of his bizarre classmates, among them a fellow horndog who lusts after the CEO's trophy wife, a nun who goes to burger school, an obese man who shocks himself to avoid overeating, a sex-crazed female guerrilla from Central America, as well as a black pop musician named Magneto Jones (Chip McAllister) who is kidnapped by police and brought into Busterburger University by handcuffs, in order to improve minority imaging. However, Russell finds himself attracted to another teacher, Mia Vunk (Debra Blee), who is the CEO's daughter and is dating Drootin. When Drootin learns of a rival suitor, he makes this a priority to drum out Russell. After being caught off campus, Drootin punishes Russell by having special sauce dumped on him while being made to listen to the company's jingle several times.Russell manages to pass the first part of the final test, an oral exam conducted by Lyman Vunk (Charles Tyner) and the teachers, and must now pass the second part, whereupon all the candidates will be made to manage a Busterburger for one day. Drootin makes sure that Russell and everyone fails by first having an eating club of obese people to the Busterburger, who will probably exhaust all the food reserves. Russell uses explosive means to dispose of them, then Drootin hijacks the drive thru intercom to insult a black motorcycle policeman's race and profession, who drives off enraged as he was simply trying to grab lunch at Busterburger. A biker girl makes a pass at Russell, who refuses this but is mistaken by her boyfriend, who gets his gang to smash up the restaurant. A bunch of black cops arrive, not to arrest the bikers but also to take part caused by Drootin's early instigation. To underscore, Drootin attempts a cornfield meet with a poultry truck, who swerves into the ruined Busterburger to avoid a car crash.The students are disheartened that they will flunk out, but Russell gives a pep talk that there's no way they cannot handle being franchise owners after these mishaps, himself now having to come to accept the responsibility. Lyman Vunk appears, but is oblivious to the carnage, instead noticing one of the burnt chickens is ideal for his proposed new line of chicken sandwiches. Drootin gets demoted to picking up litter when he smears on Vunk's suit by accident, and Russell begins a relationship with Mia.

Helga has re-written the grandmother's will to inherit everything if Vicky and her grandmother die, but a small catch can foil the entire plot: Due to an irrevocable clause in the original will that had to be left intact in the forged revised will, if Vicky dies before her 18th birthday, the grandmother's fortune will go to the state without an adult heir left alive to inherit.Another evening later, another majorette, named Barbara, is murdered in her parents swimming pool. While investigating this latest killing, Roland suspects that there is a significance to the fact that the victims are being found in water.... in which he surmises it has a symbolic significance, akin to a baptismal purification ritual.

In a climatic series of explosions that Jeff sets off and him literally gunning down dozens of armed bikers, Jeff then chases Mace into the woods where in a final confrontation, kills the gang leader.The shootout and Jeff's hospitalization leads to further confusion among the police and investigators. It is here that after Helga learns about her son's death by the biker gang, she follows through with her plans by killing Vicky's grandmother and then plots to expose the sheriff for the murders, only that Sheriff Braden turns the tables on his blackmailer by strangling Helga and sets it up to look like a suicide, while at the same time destroys the photographic evidence proving him to be the killer. The Sheriff subsequently frames the now-dead Harry for the murders, as he had a history of being a peeping tom.Some time later, Sheriff Braden watches a female coach train a young group of elementary school girls to be majorettes.

El padre las castiga a las dos, y Verónica promete vengarse.Verónica está columpiándose sola. Flavia intenta reconciliarse con ella, pero Verónica sigue enfadadísima.

A cambio de ver cómo se hace la poción, Verónica exige que Flavia le regale a Hippy. Flavia lo hace, llorando. Verónica juega ahora con Hippy, igual que antes era Flavia quien lo hacía.Es de noche, y van a hacer el conjuro. Como no tienen un gato negro, Verónica se lleva a Hippy, que intenta rebelarse y ladra. En el pajar, las niñas encienden velas y preparan un quinqué para hacer el caldo. Mientras Verónica trabaja en el caldero, Flavia, desde la entrada en el piso de abajo del pajar, realmente ve que la sombra de Verónica es la de una bruja monstruosa que se ríe malignamente.Flavia coge una vela encendida y prende fuego a la paja seca. Por si acaso, también retira la escalera de mano, único punto de entrada y salida al piso de arriba. Coge a Hippy y cierra la puerta del pajar con el cerrojo. El fuego está ya muy extendido cuando Verónica nota algo - la niña se asusta y empieza a suplicarle a Flavia que vuelva a ayudarle. El humo empieza a hacerla tosar. Flavia permanece afuera sujetando a Hippy, sin decir ni hacer nada. Verónica golpea una ventana, pero sólo consigue cortarse y ahcerse sangre en las muñecas.Verónica llora y llora, pero Flavia permance impasible; más bien sonríe un poquito abrazada a Hippy. Todo el pajar está ya en llamas - a la luz del incendio, Flavia está tranquila y sonríe.---- Escrito por KrystelClaire"

A man who runs an apartment house for women is the demented son of a Nazi surgeon who has the house equipped with secret passageways, hidden rooms and torture and murder devices.—frankfob2@yahoo.com A young woman walks through the hallways of an apartment building, looking for ""Mr. Gunther"". She walks into a room in the attic and the door closes and locks behind her. Inside the room, she finds rats in cages, as well as a woman (Sally Brown) in cage. Karl Gunther (Klaus Kinski) appears and says of the caged woman: ""She can't talk. I cut her tongue off."" Karl presses a button and a blade is shoved through the woman's back and sticks out of her chest, killing her. Karl smears some of the dead woman's blood from his finger into an inscribed bullet and loads it into a revolver. He points the gun to his head and the gun clicks. He puts the gun down and says: ""So be it.""Sometime later, Sophie Fisher (Tané) is in her apartment in the building, which is located in ""a big city"" somewhere in the USA. A man watches Sophie from her outside window on the ground floor, and Karl is seen also spying on her from behind an air vent. The man crawls through the window and surprises her, but it is only her boyfriend Hank (David Abbott), whom has come to visit her. Hank and Sophie kiss and spend time on her bed as they begin to have sex while Karl continues to watch them.The next day, a man comes to Karl's door of his apartment where he inquires about a vacant apartment advertised in the local newspaper. Karl takes one look at the man and tells him that it has been rented. But seconds after the man leaves, Lori Bancroft (Talia Balsam) enters the small urban apartment building and when she inquires about the vacant apartment, Karl hospitably takes her to it and shows her around the room. Karl introduces himself as the landlord and superintendent of the building and that the apartment was recently vacated by a young woman who disappeared without paying her rent. Karl explains about the building, the neighborhood and of the monthly rent. As Lori looks around the kitchen, Karl turns on the stove and puts his hand over the blue flame while Lori is not looking. Hiding his pain, Karl asks if she will take the apartment. Lori says yes, which prompts Karl to pull his hand away from the flame and shakes her hand with his other one. Later, Karl is back in his secret room in the attic writing in his diary and says that he is addicted to killing for it makes him feel alive. Martha, the tongueless woman in the cage, gives him a note saying: ""Please kill me"". Karl tells Martha that he cannot because he would have no one to talk to.The following day, Harriet Watkins (Barbara Whinnery), another resident of the apartment complex, arrives at her apartment with some groceries. Karl appears in the hallway and helps her with her bags. Seeing the bandage on his right hand, Harriet is about to ask him what happened and Karl tells her that he accidentally burned himself. Harriet talks to him about ""vices"" but he seems reluctant to discuss it.Later, all of the women of the building have a get-together to welcome Lori while Karl spies on them from the air vents. He pushes a few buttons on a remote control device and a small door opens in the room and a rat comes out. The women scream and jump up on furniture, but Lori just sits and laughs at it all.Back in her apartment, Lori hears clicking sounds and goes to Karl's front door. She tells him about the sounds, and he says that its probably just rats. In his diary, Karl writes of once being a doctor, practicing euthanasia (""mercy killing"") and being ashamed at himself when learning, after reading his father's secret diary, that the Nazis used the same word when killing Jews. Karl plays Russian roulette with his gun hoping to someday kill himself to end his killing spree with what little morality he has left.A little later, Sophie is in her apartment playing her piano and singing, while Karl watches her from outside her window. He ducks away when he sees Hank. Hank notices Karl nearby and correctly assuming that he is also spying on Sophie, he moves in with a switchblade, while Karl pulls out a switchblade knife of his own. Later, Karl is back in his apartment where he puts two eyeballs into a jar of formaldehyde. He goes to his back room, points the gun at his head and pulls the trigger and it clicks. He tries the gun again and gets another click. ""So be it,"" says Karl.A few days later, Josef Steiner (Kenneth Robert Shippy) arrives at the building and goes to Karl's front door. When Karl answers, Steiner claims that he has been searing for Karl for almost three years. Karl reluctantly lets him inside, and Steiner calls him a murderer. He says that in the five years that Karl was the chief resident at a hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 67 people under his care (all with routine illnesses) died, one of them being Steiner's brother. Steiner shows a photograph of Karl's father to him, dressed in a Nazi SS uniform, and some papers where Karl's father described instruments of torture for concentration camps and was executed over 30 years ago for ""crimes against humanity"". Karl tells Steiner to leave, and the man brings out a photograph of a young Karl, saluting in a Nazi uniform. When he is alone, Karl weeps.Later, Karl writes more in his diary about accidentally killing a healthy patient when he was a resident at a hospital in Nazi Germany in the early 1940s, and feeling no remorse. He began to understand the feelings that his equally sociopath father wrote about: it was god-like to the able to give life and then take it away.In his crawlspace by the vent, Karl spies on Jessica Marlow (Carl Francis), a local soap opera actress, who arrives back at her apartment with her boyfriend Alfred Lassiter (Jack Hiller). Karl begins to make clicking sounds in the vent by hitting his knife on a steel ball, and continues doing so after Jessica and Alfred are in bed having sex. Karl hears a sudden, sharp scream and he quickly crawls away and back into his apartment only to see that a pet cat of his had inadvertently set off one of his traps, leaving only a detached tail behind. ""Sorry, kitty"", says Karl.Back in Jessica's apartment, Alfred becomes irritated by the clicking sounds and leaves. He hears something outside the hall and goes into Karl's room. A little later, Karl is seen putting a severed finger (with Alfred's class ring on it) into another jar of formaldehyde.As Lori is preparing to take a bath, she hears clicks, and a large rat jumps out at her from the vent in the bathroom. She goes to Karl's front door and knocks but there is no answer. In his room, Karl crawls back and is setting up another trap, pushing a button on the arm of a chair and a spear shoots up from the seat.Another few days later, Steiner goes to Lori's apartment and tries getting information from her about Karl and how much she knows about him. Karl overhears them from his crawlspace behind the air vent and loads a dart gun and prepares to use it to shoot Steiner, but he changes his mind (surmising that it would not be painful enough). Lori asks the nosy Steiner to leave. He then heads up to Karl's door which is open and lets himself inside. Steiner sees swinging steel balls hanging from the ceiling. He sits in a chair and reads from Karl's diary. Karl appears in the room asking what he is doing. Steiner sees him, turns, and accidentally sets off the chair trap. Looking distraught, Karl runs to his back room, loads a single bullet into the revolver, spins it, and pulls the trigger three times only to get three clicks. ""So be it,"" says Karl. He then goes up to his secret room in the attic and runs a film projector showing a movie of Hitler and the Nazis at a political rally. Karl proclaims: ""I am my own god, my own jury, and my own executioner"". He puts on an old SS uniform with a Nazi cap, looks at himself in a mirror and salutes: ""Hail, Gunther!"" He decides that now is the time to kill everyone who knows about him before the police show up looking for Steiner and the other murder victims.Later that same night, Lori returns home to her apartment and finds live rats in her refrigerator. Just then, Karl phones her where he tells her to look in her bathtub. Lori enters her bathroom and finds a dead Steiner floating in the blood-stained water with a swastika carved on his forehead. Lori runs out and sees Karl standing outside her window, wearing his Nazi uniform, with his face decorated up looking pasty white complete with blood red lipstick. He is hitting a small steel ball with a knife. Lori tries to run, but steel bars come down before her in the hallway, preventing her from running out of the building. Lori knocks on Sophie's door, forces it open, and finds Sophie dead, sitting at her piano having set off one of Karl's traps. Lori also finds Harriet dead in her apartment too from another one of Karl's traps.Lori runs upstairs to the secret room in the attic and looks for a place to hide. She finds Martha in her cage who points Lori to a hanging key. Lori tries to unlock the cage, but the two women hear Karl coming towards the front door. Martha points Lori to one of the crawlspace entrances in the floor, but that it is booby trapped. Lori takes off one of her sneakers and puts it in the entrance frame on the floor where a sensor activated blade slices off the top of the sneaker. With the trap sprung, Lori is able to enter the crawlspace and begins searching for a way to escape.Karl enters the room and releases a cage of rats into the crawlspace. Lori crawls around to evade the rats and goes to another crawlspace exit only to find herself in Jessica's apartment with a dead Jessica hanging from the ceiling after being caught in another of Karl's booby traps. Karl gets inside the crawlspace and begins crawling after Lori, and eventually speeds after her with a wheeled grate kept in the crawlspace. Lori manages to make it back to Karl's room again and gets Martha out of her cage with the key. Karl crawls out of the crawlspace and hides. Just then, Lori and Martha hear a reaction from Karl. They find Karl with a blade sticking from his chest before he collapses. Lori and Martha run out of the room. Karl's eyes begin to move, and he removes the ""blade"" from his chest. (This act was staged by Karl apparently to try to lure Lori or Martha close enough so he could kill them... which did not work.)Lori and Martha enter Karl's apartment where they see a phone. When Lori picks up the phone to call the police, she and Martha notice Karl standing in the doorway with a knife. As he approaches the two women, Lori sees the revolver that Karl plays Russian roulette with and grabs it. She points it at him and the gun clicks several times until finally there is a gunshot.""So be it,"" says Karl."

Buck walks alone on a country road. Soon, Jamie pulls up in a chauffeured Rolls Royce convertible, and offers a glass of champagne to celebrate their freedom and expresses his thanks to Buck for saving his life during a prison knife attack some years ago. Buck refuses the drink, but accepts the ride home.As they arrive at River City, Buck's hometown, Jamie invites him to Miami, Florida, to work at one of his family's various legitimate ""businesses"". When Buck declines Jamie's offer, Jamie is frustrated and waits, while Buck meets with Sheriff Copeland (Seymour Cassel) about his parole. The Sheriff is very hostile and unfriendly towards Buck and wants him to leave town. Afterward, Buck's friend, Deputy Sergeant J.B. Deveraux (Yaphet Kotto), accompanies him to a nearby gift store. Before Buck leaves in J.B.'s car, Jamie hands his former prison mate his telephone number in case he ever needs anything.J.B. drops Buck at a ranch, where Buck's 10-year-old daughter, Jennifer (Judith Barsi), greets him with a hug. He hands her a present, then embraces his wife, Christie (Denise Galik). Later, she says he can return to his old construction job, but the boss wants him to start at the bottom and work his way back to foreman. She thinks it would be better to move to a place where they could make a fresh start, but Buck refuses claiming that he was born and grew up in River City and wants to stay.Later that evening, as a nurse named Dawn (Kimberlin Brown) finishes her shift at the hospital, a motorcycle gang surrounds her car, and attacks her. Buck hears her screams, and races to the scene in his pickup truck. There, he sideswipes gang members with his vehicle. Then, Buck and ""Blade,"" (William Smith) the gang leader, stare at each other until Blade orders his fellow gang members to leave. Buck takes Dawn to the hospital, where Sheriff Copeland arrives and openly accuses him of being a vigilante, and warns that any more displays of the same behavior will send him back to prison.When Buck returns home, Melody Mendoza (Amelia Haas), a local television reporter, congratulates him for being a hero. The motorcycle gang hears Melody's report on television, and learns Buck's home address. Meanwhile, Christie informs Buck that the gang distributes drugs, and the sheriff does nothing to stop them. J.B. warns Buck that the gang will seek revenge when he is on the job or alone at home. He asks Buck to avoid any further confrontations.

Buck and the gang leader stare at each other, but J.B. grabs Buck's arm to prevent him from doing anything rash. Later, J.B. points out the gang's drug manufacturing plant in the desert, and explains that the sheriff protects their interests. Since Buck has returned from Vietnam with a bunch of medals, the admiration of the town, and a willingness to confront authority. J. B. says the sheriff fears him and wants him gone. They return to Buck's trashed home, but Buck insists on staying there.Meanwhile, the Sheriff meets Blade in the desert where the Sheriff gets his weekly bribes of cash in exchange for ignoring the motorcycle gang's antics. When the Sheriff advises Blade to tone down his gang's activities which has led to Christie Matthew's death, the violent and sociopath Blade grabs the sheriff by the throat, hands him a stack of cash, and warns him to mind his own business, while Blade will safeguard his own interests. Blade orders the Sheriff to keep Buck out of their way and either make him leave town or kill him.A few days later, a huge unmarked semi-trailer truck arrives in town and delivers a state-of-the-art pickup truck custom outfitted with sophisticated weaponry to Buck's front door (complete with light machine guns, twin mortars, and sharp weapons). Along with the new pickup truck is a short letter to Buck from Jamie living in Miami, which reads: ""Now we are even. Good luck, Amigo. Jamie"".At the hospital, Dawn administers physical therapy to an unresponsive Jennifer. Buck brings his daughter a music box to replace the one destroyed in the attack. However, Jennifer does not respond.In his new truck, Buck listens to a police scanner, and, at night, he sets a trap in town. Buck strings a low-hanging wire across the road, and when three gang members on their motorcycles appear looking for people to harass, they run into the wire. Two of the bikers are decapitated, and another one is mauled and dies as well. After the three gang members are dead, Buck leaves the bodies in the street but removes the evidence from the scene.The next day at the station, the corrupt sheriff interrogates Buck, insisting he is responsible for the deaths of the gang members. Buck dares the sheriff to prove he did the crime. The sheriff responds by hitting Buck and that when he has his proof, Buck will go back to prison for a long time.Some days later, the gang returns to Buck's property, and deposits Christie's coffin (which they dug up and desecrated) in front of Buck's house. When Buck sees the coffin, he is sick to his stomach. As he digs a new grave for his wife, Deputy Roscoe arrives and warns that the gang is toying with him, and will ultimately kill him. When Roscoe warns Buck that his shotgun is a parole violation, Buck dares the deputy to arrest him. Roscoe backs down and leaves, telling Buck that he is already a dead man for picking a war with the motorcycle gang.Soon, Buck visits J.B. at a private airport to request extra protection for Jennifer at the hospital as J.B. works on his airplane.Another day later, Buck ambushes another group of four biker gang members by using his old pickup truck as bait. As the four bikers assault the truck, Buck drives on the scene in his new armed and armored pickup truck and kills all four gang members.Still later, Buck and J.B. wait for the gang's next move, then kill and disable several more members when they assault a gas station garage. During the engagement, they wound and send one of the bikers, who happens to be Blade's brother, Ray, to the hospital with a crushed larynx. At the hospital that evening, Buck offers Dawn a ride home. Later, gang members murder the police guard in front of Jennifer's room, and Buck's friend, Jimmy, standing watch inside.As Buck drinks beer on Dawn's porch and flirts with her, she receives a telephone call that the gang kidnapped Jennifer. Buck returns to the hospital in dressed in a doctor's scrubs and tortures Ray in his hospital bed until he reveals Jennifer's whereabouts. Buck then leaves Ray to die of a heart attack caused by fright when Buck places a fake stick of dynamite up Ray's rectum. As Sheriff Copeland places Buck under arrest, but Father Healey says he has no grounds. The sheriff pulls out his gun and threatens to kill Buck right there as a summary execution, but the priest says the sheriff will have to shoot him first. The sheriff backs down and allows Buck to leave. Outside the hospital, J.B. waits in Buck's truck, and asks him if he has a plan.The next morning, Buck goes to the town's bar and later to a bingo hall to plead for help, but the townspeople, (out of fear of retribution by the biker gang) refuse to help him. Buck curses at their cowardice and leaves.Alone, Buck drives to the gang's camp in the desert, and sees Jennifer imprisoned in a wire cage. Meanwhile, J.B. flies his airplane to assist Buck, who ambushes gang members with a barrage of firepower. Above, J.B. drops grenades and dynamite from the air, destroying several tents and some structures of the biker camp. Buck assaults the camp in his armed pickup truck and causes havoc, killing several gang members with his truck's weapons, rescues Jennifer from her cage, and places her in the truck. Then, he launches a full-scale attack on Blade and his followers. When J.B. lands his airplane on an airstrip after being hit and forced down by small arms fire from the ground, he returns to Buck's truck for safety. A futuristic cannon mounted to the back of Buck's truck kills several more gang members pursuing on motorcycles.Buck drives to town, and stops at a police checkpoint. The Sheriff orders his men to arrest or kill Buck, but the deputies, having had enough of his corruption and abuse of authority, refuse to make a move. When the Sheriff tries to arrest Buck himself, he knees the corrupt law officer in the groin, and forces him into the truck. He asks J.B. to watch Jennifer, and returns to Blade's ravaged camp. As Buck dodges bullets and mortar rounds in the truck from the armed gang members, the Sheriff panics, and offers to cut a deal, giving Buck half of all the bribes he receives. Instead, Buck handcuffs him, and allows the truck to be blown up by a mortar round, with the Sheriff inside.Blade promises his followers that he will finish off Buck personally. The two adversaries fight in a climatic hand-to-hand fight until Buck grabs hold of a shotgun. However, he decides not to use it against Blade, and their fistfight continues. Then, J.B. arrives with a handful of armed reinforcements and Deputy Roscoe arrives with some armed policemen and they watch Buck and Blade's hand-to-hand fight alongside the motorcycle gang. Blade suffocates after falling into a vat of cocaine, and Buck finishes him off with one last punch. With their leader dead, the remaining dozen or so gang members start their motorcycles and retreat. Buck smiles as he approaches J.B. and tells his friend, ""It's good to see you."" The final overhead shot shows the remains of the gang's camp as the surviving motorcycle gang members ride away (presumably to look for another small town to hide out in and terrorize), as Buck and J.B. stand facing each other and look on at the remains of the biker camp.Freeze frame.

Summer Camp Nightmare,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094070/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of campers revolt against their strict camp director and take over the camp for themselves. At Camp North Pines for Boys, the campers, led by the charismatic Franklin Reilly, stage a revolt against the strict owner, Mr. Warren, and lock him and the rest of the counselors up and take over the camp for themselves. But the revolt soon spirals out of control as the boys also lead a takeover of the nearby girls camp as well. Then, Mr. Warren is accidentally killed trying to escape. Friction soon happens between the two boys and girls camps, which only one camper, a certain Donald Poultry, tries to get the word out and unseat Franklin as the leader.—matt-282 Donald Poultry (Adam Carl) is a young, intelligent but somewhat socially stunted middle school boy attending Camp North Pines for the summer along with other middle and high school kids. Riding the bus to the camp, he talks into his tape recorder diary, voicing his concerns. All goes well upon arrival; the kids unpack and are given time to play outside before the introductory camp dinner. Donald is caught by a counselor-in-training and bully, Stanley Runk (Stuart Rogers), whose friends call him Runk The Punk. Runk tells Donald it's time for cabin cleaning, but becomes interested in Donald's tape recorder. Donald fools him into thinking it's a computer that analyzes him in an insulting way, and Donald strikes up an immediate enmity with Runk, only to be saved by another CIT, Chris Wade (Harold P. Pruett), who dismisses Runk.At the dinner shortly afterwards, everyone says hello to the returning counselors Ed Heinz (Rick Fitts) and Jack Caldwell (Chris Hubbell), and Ed leads them in a welcoming applause for the new camp director Mr. Warren (Chuck Connors). Some of the boys recognize him as an old principal from their school and grumble about how strict his ruling of the camp will probably be. Mr. Warren is a middle-aged man with a generally pleasant demeanor, but he is overbearing when it comes to authority, striving to keep things ""appropriate"" for everyone. He is quite restrained, having limited the rec hall television to only receiving broadcasts from a religious channel, and warning everyone away from a dangerous rope bridge that leads to South Pines, the girls' side of the camp.The next day, Mr. Warren invites some of the younger group to a butterfly hunt, revealing that collecting and studying butterflies is his hobby and specialty. Some of the older boys jeer at him behind his back, calling him ""fruity,"" except for Franklin Reilly (Charles Stratton), the CIT of the younger group, who seems respecting of his presence and protective of the young children like Chris.Some of the older boys sneak off to the bridge after the dinner is over, and Franklin climbs the open-rope loop from start to finish, but they are all caught and reprimanded by Ed. Ed reminds them that summer camp is a place to have fun, not charge headfirst into danger. They all head back to the main camp in time for the evening swim. Chris tries teaching Donald how to swim, but is interrupted by a visiting female doctor who introduces herself, much to the approval of the campers. Continuing on his own, Donald accidentally floats out too far and begins to drown, but the counselors don't notice. Franklin looks up from his reading to see Donald in trouble. Surprised, he glances around to see that nobody else is responding, and jumps in to save Donald himself. When the counselors hear the frantic splashing, they reach the boys as they come out of the water. When Jack asks Franklin what happened, Franklin responds angrily that he's just doing their job for them.A few days later, Franklin finds a shy boy named Peter (Scott Curtis) in the cabin by himself. He asks if Peter is okay, the Peter responds that he became scared when Mr. Warren kept lifting him up too high to see some of the butterflies on the hunt. When Runk enters, Franklin implies that Mr. Warren did something inappropriate to Peter, causing Runk to become furious. Franklin convinces Runk to let him take care of the problem on his own.Later that evening, when the boys are bored in the rec hall, Donald and Chris climb up to the roof to fix the rigging on the satellite dish and unlock the disabled channels. Mr. Warren comes in to see the boys all cheering over a music video featuring half-naked women, and he furiously locks down the rec hall. The next night, during a co-ed talent show in which the girls from South Pines visit, he further angers the boys by ending the event early in response to an inappropriate song contributed by Runk and John Mason, and as punishment, he also cancels the upcoming co-ed dance.Some of the boys meet that night, including all of the CITs with the exception of Chris, who has been sent to the ""meditation center"" as punishment for making out with one of the girls after the show. Franklin leads the group in a discussion about how Mr. Warren is ruining their summer, and he proposes staging a coup and shutting away the authority to take control of the camp themselves. When some of the boys appear apprehensive, Franklin assures them it'll be like a game, not serious, and Donald helps by relating the ""game"" to capture the flag. Franklin, impressed with Donald, appoints him to the position of captain in the upcoming revolution. Stunned, but easily won over, Donald accepts. Afterwards, the other boys are more easily sold.The next morning, Franklin gets up early and steals a gun the counselors keep locked away for protection. The day begins as an event called Camper-Counselor Turnabout, where the campers and counselors trade places. Everyone is having fun that morning, even counselor Jack, who usually finds it difficult to get along with some of the younger group due to his heavy-duty fitness regimens. At breakfast, camper Shawn poses as Mr. Warren and with his fake authority, he lists several joking changes to the rules that everyone agrees with enthusiastically. However, he is interrupted by a suggestion from Franklin to free Chris from the meditation center, and the suggestion becomes a demanding chant from more than half of the mess hall, startling the counselors.Franklin and his group quickly run out the back door, pursued by the counselors, who chase them to the meditation center. Though Mr. Warren appears to have the upper hand initially, when he tries to lock Franklin in the building, Franklin takes control by revealing the gun he stole. The other boys help him get the counselors into the meditation center, changing its name to the ""pen,"" and they pull a bewildered Chris out. Chris tries to convince Franklin not to go any farther, but Franklin replies that he's simply made a citizen's arrest. He further states that the ""game"" will only last for twenty-four hours. Paul and Runk stay behind to board up the pen while the other boys run off to begin ""the revolution"". While Franklin and Runk visit the girls' camp to capture the female counselors and take over there as well, the rest of the group take over the main office and disable the phone lines. Donald helps Franklin wire the office's intercom into South Pines, and Franklin announces to the girls what has happened.All the boys and girls gather in front of the rec hall of North Pines, and Franklin explains to everyone that it's time for the campers to have a say in how the camp is run. He appoints some of the boys and girls to ranks and positions, giving them control over certain aspects of the new combined camp. He leads everyone in an oath to the revolution, where the campers all swear not to betray the leaders.That night, a party breaks out in the rec hall, including even the little kids, some of which drink the spiked punch. Chris and his new girlfriend Heather (Melissa Brennan) become shocked at how out of control things are, and they carry off the younger kids and put them to bed. Things get worse when John and Runk drag Mr. Warren out of the pen and into the party to see how he will react to it. Everyone laughs to see him with his mouth taped and his hands tied behind his back. He becomes uncomfortable when one of the drunk girls begins dancing sexily in front of him, but Chris runs back in and stops them. He takes the tape off Mr. Warren and tries to free him, but the other boys take charge again and Franklin pulls Chris outside to have a talk.Runk leads Mr. Warren back toward the pen, but Mr. Warren starts to struggle. He shows surprising physical strength, twisting away from Runk multiple times and bashing him furiously even with his hands tied. Runk pulls out a knife and threatens Mr. Warren, but Mr. Warren charges Runk and runs right into the knife. Runk becomes shocked as Mr. Warren falls dead to the ground. He runs back over to the main office where Franklin is sitting, and blubbering, he tells Franklin what happened. Franklin almost loses control at the news, but then he pulls himself together and orders Runk to take Mr. Warren out to the caves far behind the camp and leave him in there. He warns Runk to keep the incident a secret and do exactly as he says from now on.The next morning, Franklin announces to the camp that the revolution will continue, and he emphasizes that campers who show courage and dedication to the revolution will be named officers. He also promotes Donald to Minister of Propaganda and appoints him to the Supreme Revolutionary Committee. He goes on to name Chris Wade and Heather Long as traitors, and orders everyone to shun them. He warns that anyone seen associating with them will also be named traitors. When Chris and Heather venture out into the main cap that morning, they are stunned to see everyone running away from them. When Donald nervously refuses interaction with them, Chris realizes the situation is worse than he thought, and he and Heather run off. A girl named Laurie (Jennifer McGrath) then asks Donald out to the rescheduled dance that will be held that night, and he accepts, but tells her he doesn't know how to dance. She offers to teach him, and they happily feed the camp animals together.That night before the dance, some of the campers start a bonfire with Mr. Warren's wooden butterfly collection post outside the rec hall. People laugh at it on their way in. Laurie stands with some of her friends, telling them enthusiastically about Donald, and the girls gush when he arrives to dance with her. John leaves the dance with Debbie to go on a walk with her, but he becomes grabby and she tries to leave him. He angrily pushes her to the ground and sexually assaults her, drawing the attention of Donald and Laurie, who are also out walking, and they run to help. They report John to Franklin, and Franklin holds a meeting the next morning with the members of the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, John's friends, and Debbie's. Donald and Laurie attend as well to support her. Treating the matter like a judge in a court case, Franklin demands John tell him the truth, and John claims Debbie went along with the whole thing and is just a dirty little tease. Franklin asks Debbie what she thinks John's punishment should be, and she claims she wants him dead. The meeting erupts into a confused discussion, but Franklin controls everyone and says he will consider this while John sits out in the pen.A little later, Franklin decides to force John to traverse the rope bridge in a ""trial by ordeal"" arrangement, mimicking older societies who punished criminals by making them perform dangerous tasks that could kill them. When John successfully loops the whole bridge, the girls become angry at him. They wait for the other guys to leave, and then they carry John off and hang him from a tree.Donald finds John's body and becomes very upset, deciding things have gone far enough. He jerry rigs the disabled phone lines into the satellite over the main office, using a stolen receiver as a radio. He tries to call through to someone, but only hears static, and he is captured by Officer Blackridge and locked inside the office. Chris visits him and they talk about how the camp has gone nuts, but Blackridge finds Chris and throws him out.The next morning, the camp becomes shocked to learn that Donald will be forced to loop the bridge as well, and some of them begin to realize how dangerous Franklin is. They begin to rally support amongst themselves as the crowd gathers by the bridge in time for Donald's punishment. At first it looks like he might make it, but then Franklin orders Runk to cut one of the ropes on the bridge. The campers realize Franklin wants Donald dead, and they all snap and turn against the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, fighting them off to save Donald.The police arrive suddenly, breaking up the fight, revealing they received Donald's broadcast the previous night. They take Donald's tape recorded diary for evidence, and Donald and Chris are dismissed as unwilling participants. Franklin and Runk are taken into custody by the police. Heather and Laurie wait together by the bus for home, and are both relieved to see Chris and Donald arrive. They all board together, and the bus roars off, leaving the camp deserted."

Chicken [Billy Lau] and Sonny[?], make what they think might be a major find--three
corpses from the Chien Lung reign. One is a woman, another looks like her
son, and the third looks like the father. A family! Not only are they
dressed in clothing and jewels from that period, but the corpses
themselves are perfectly preserved. In fact, their flesh is still soft.
The discerning viewer will recognize, of course, that the yellow talismans
pasted on the corpses' foreheads are wards against the undead. This is not
an ordinary family...it is a family of chiang-shih!Professor Kwok telephones Mr Nelsson, who requests a sample of the
find, so the professor and Sonny transport the boy. On the way, the
talisman is blown off the little chiang-shih's forehead and he escapes.
Meanwhile, Chicken is attempting to discern the meaning to the talisman on
Mama's forehead. He removes it in order to look it up in a book, which
says that the talisman ""touches yin and yang and unites the five elements.
It can exorcise all kinds of spirits. It's called the 'corpse-appeasing
talisman'. Any corpse pasted with it may get provoked. Descendents
shouldn't tear it off or it may resurrect."" While Chicken is reading, Mama [Pauline Wong]
awakens. Thereafter follows seven minutes in which both hopping vampires

awakening them. Thereafter follows 11+ minutes in which both hopping

bite is to get some blood from a chiang-shih, he goes to the morgue where
Mama and Papa have been taken. Jen and Master Lin have also gone to the
morgue in order to spear the hearts of the vampires, but the corpses are
too frozen for the stakes to penetrate. Likewise, their skin is too frozen
for the hypodermic needle to penetrate, so Professor Kwok orders that the
bodies be taken back to his place. While in transport, Mama
and Papa escape, hopping from car roof to car roof and causing major chaos
such that a TV crew shows up to report the damage.Meanwhile, chiang-shih boy has found his way into Mr Hu's [Fung Wo] greenhouse,

waiting police shine intense lights on them.Fortunately, Master Lin shows up. He and Jen manage to drive a stake
through Mama's heart and, after luring Papa into the greenhouse, set the
joint afire. Badly burned, Papa escapes but the police kill him with a

vowing to help OK Boy into ""early, happy reincarnation"", Buddha be

confronted with Chicken and Sonny, both of whom have become vampires.

Alan fights back and kills his attacker with a broken bottle.Alan gets back to the hotel room with his clothes covered in blood. He confesses everything to Lola who takes the clothes away and burns them.

However they are approached by Lucette Beulemans, a white ex-pat shop-keeper, and her lover Theophile Bijou. They reveal that they witnessed the murder and have the broken bottle with Alan's fingerprints. The fact that he did not report the killing himself means that claiming that it was self-defence will be somewhat unconvincing. The bottle will only be returned for $50,000.Lola sets about getting the money by contacting her wealthy relatives and later selling her jewellery and other valuable items to Mrs Burns, a fellow hotel guest.Alan meanwhile learns that the police has arrested a young man called Eustache for the murder.

The mother further reveals that her son is gay and has been jailed because the chief of police wants Eustache's boyfriend for himself ! Alan then finds Theophile who reveals that he has been double-crossed by Lucette, who has disappeared with the money, the bottle, everything. Alan tells Theophile that the best thing to do now is to go to the police and for Theophile to reveal that he witnessed the murder.Presumably driven mad by Lucette's betrayal or fearful of being jailed for blackmail, Theophile instead tries to strangle Alan who fights back and both are seriously injured in the fight.Lola meanwhile is back at the hotel where she is still plagued by the dream of being chased in the metro by the lipstick-wearing man. She even goes to the bar and orders the same drinks as her husband, presumably intending to get drunk as well. At that moment Alan calls her from Theophile's house begging for help.The two men are admitted to hospital where Theophile is kept under police guard. Applying lipstick for the first time in a long while, Lola reveals to Alan that years ago she was almost raped in the metro by the man with lipstick but fought back by stabbing him in the crotch with his own knife.

Hollywood Vice Squad,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091213/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mother goes to Hollywood to find her runaway daughter. The Vice Squad discovers that a dangerous gangster has turned the girl into one of his junkie teen prostitutes. The Squad also investigates illegal betting and a BDSM pornographer. Three different teams of Hollywood Vice Squad officers work on three separate cases involving illegal betting run by the Mob, a sleazy BDSM porn director and a ruthless old gangster who runs a teenage prostitution ring. Officers Chang and Stevens work the streets busting hookers. Chang's favorite m.o. is turning into an exaggerated caricature of a stereotypical Asian tourist to gain the girls' trust and then bust them. Things take a serious turn when one of the girls turns out to be a dangerous man in drag who puts a knife to Chang's throat and forces him to take a ride with him, forcing Stevens to engage in hot pursuit. Officer Betty Melton is a rookie who wants to prove herself but her superiors, officers Chavez and Miller, won't let her. When she accidentally witnesses a sleazy backyard BDSM porn shoot involving what seems to be an underage actor, Betty turns to Captain Jensen in hopes of finally getting a case to investigate by herself, but Jensen orders Chavez and Miller to grow up and help her. Officer Daley and hulking officer Tank investigate a proud elderly African-American bookie named Jesse who takes illegal bets for a mobster called Luchessi. They need Jesse's cooperation to get Luchessi but can they guarantee Jesse's safety in return? Meanwhile, Pauline Stanton, a desperate mother who arrived in Hollywood to find her beautiful innocent runaway teenage daughter Lori, asks Jensen for help. His men suspect that the girl is alive and may be turning tricks for Walsh, a ruthless old gangster who seduces teenage girls with promise of fame and stardom only to turn them into his junkie prostitutes. Worse yet, once he has no more use for them they usually end up dead from ""accidental"" overdose. Jensen gives the case to his top undercover officers Hawkins and Judy. Hawkins pretends to be the new player in town with Judy as his main squeeze to get Walsh and his right hand man Farber to literally sell him Lori. After another hot pursuit involving a rampaging man on PCP who stole a bus full of passengers, Chang and Stevens join Hawkins as backup. However, Walsh also has a backup, his equally ruthless madam Veronica and psychotic shotgun-loving goon Daniello. In Hollywood, California Los Angeles vice squad officer Ray Chang (Evan Kim) poses as a Chinese immigrant in an unmarked car to solicit a transvestite prostitute, who points a knife at Chang and orders him to drive. Chang's partner, Stevens (Joey Travolta), follows and has to drive on the sidewalk when his vehicle is pinned in traffic. When the prostitute realizes they are being followed, he accuses Chang of being a police officer. He admits his identity, struggles to disarm the prostitute, and bites her/his leg. When Chang stops his car, the prostitute runs away. The two officers chase her on foot and into a swimming pool. When Chang asks Stevens for help, he admits he cannot swim. The prostitute is arrested and taken into custody.Some time later, Los Angeles Police Captain Jensen (Ronny Cox) meets with Pauline Stanton (Trish Van DeVere), a mother who has traveled from the mid-west to search for her only runaway teenage daughter, Lori (Robin Wright). Pauline Stanton shows Capt. Jensen a letter her daughter sent to a friend describing a man named James Walsh (Frank Gorshin), who has promised to jump-start her show business career. Pauline says Lori does not know how to cook, clean, or do laundry, and doubts she knows how to support herself. The captain asks his staff to start a file on James Walsh, owner of Pretty Girl Escorts. At his agency, Walsh accuses Lori Stanton of withholding her tips in order to buy heroin for herself. He orders her to stop stealing, then placates her with a ""nickel bag"" of the drug.Back on Hollywood Boulevard, a potential customer tries to entice Betty Melton (Carrie Fisher), a vice officer disguised as prostitute, with his vibrator named ""Mike."" As soon as he offers Betty his services, officers descend to make an arrest, but the perpetrator escapes with a vice officer hanging from his car window. The man drives erratically, hoping to dislodge the officer, but crashes his car and is arrested. Betty Melton snaps at her fellow officers for moving in for the arrest instead of letting her handle it.Later, Betty jogs in her neighborhood, and notices some children peering over a wall. Upon investigation, she witnesses the filming of a sadomasochistic pornographic movie scene from a involving an underage actor. When Betty informs Capt. Jensen of her discovery, he wants her to turn over her information to officers Tom Chavez (Eloy Casados) and Frankie Miller (Tom Everett). Betty tells Jensen she believes the department is prejudiced against women, the captain suggests that her competitive spirit makes it hard for other officers to accept her.Back in Hollywood, as Pauline Stanton walks the streets looking for her daughter, Lori takes a customer to a hotel. Meanwhile, the captain assigns Officer Hawkins (Leon Isaac Kennedy), also known as ""Hawk,"" and his partner, Judy (Cec Verrell), to find Lori. Hawk also wants to dismantle James Walsh's operation by posing as ""Edward Debussy,"" a newly relocated competitor from Detroit, Michigan. Hawk suggests they buy girls from Walsh to start their own stable, and collect enough evidence to arrest him, and Capt. Jensen agrees.Later, Chang and Stevens arrive at a crime scene to find a dead prostitute named Lilly, who worked for Walsh. Capt. Jensen orders them to investigate and share their information with Hawk and Judy. In a hotel room, Candy, a Walsh escort, interviews with Hawk/Edward Debussy. When he makes her an offer to join him, she is surprised when he turns down an opportunity to sample her services. Later, Walsh threatens Candy if she leaves him.Still later, Betty Melton returns to the pornographic film set with Miller and Chavez. They explain that it is necessary to collect as much evidence as possible in order to obtain a search warrant. Walsh sends his associate, Farber (Beau Starr), to discourage Hawk/Edward Debussy from poaching his women, but Hawk lets Farber know that he only wants to deal with the top man. Walsh calls Hawk to set up a meeting. Farber warns Walsh to be careful, but Walsh has a secret weapon: ""Daniello."" At the meeting, Hawk wants to purchase or lease the finest girls and Walsh is agreeable.At night, Betty Melton sneaks into the garage at the movie location. She sees incriminating photographs, and hears the director take a phone call. Later, Tom Chavez notes her actions were illegal, but Betty has come up with more leads.At another meeting, Hawk informs Walsh he wants to buy three of his girls to work a party at a convention. Walsh rejects the party idea because it is too easy for police to arrange a bust, and offers to call shortly with an alternative plan.On the street, Chavez, Miller, and Betty Melton watch the film house until Miller makes a run to the building and hears disturbing noises. Chavez insists they get a warrant, but Miller persuades him to act without one. The officers interrupt filming, and Betty captures the director as he attempts to escape through the backyard.At the station, when the captain tells Pauline that Lori is working as a prostitute and is a drug addict, she is in denial.In Chinatown, Walsh and Farber set up a trap with Daniello to follow Lori to her appointment with Hawk's men. Walsh meets Hawk at Diamond Jim's nightclub, where he offers two girls to entertain Chang and Stevens, who pose as conventioneers. Farber escorts them to their destination.Back at the nightclub, Walsh brags about the assets of his top girl, Veronica, and suggests that Hawk/Debussy look under the table to see for himself. He observes Veronica pointing a gun held between her legs. Hawk tells his partner, Judy, that Walsh has a strange sense of humor.At the Tropicana Motel, Farber informs Chang and Stevens that they can sample a girl, one at a time. As Chang walks to the room, Stevens reminds him to avoid sexual contact or they will lose the case.Meanwhile, Hawk asks that Veronica point her gun somewhere else, but Walsh ignores the request. Veronica remarks that if Chang tries anything funny, there is a shotgun in a closet waiting for him. When Walsh prevents Hawk from using the bathroom, he upends the table. Veronica shoots him in the leg as he and Walsh fight. Partner Judy struggles to grab Veronica's gun, while Walsh escapes. When police arrive, Veronica tells them the name of the motel.As the captain and backup units arrive, they devise a plan to rescue Chang when, after knocking Farber unconscious, Stevens returns to the motel and gives them the room number. Chang stalls for time, making idle conversation with Lori Stanton. Stevens sneaks in through the bathroom window, and motions to Chang to get away. Chang grabs Lori and ducks for cover. Daniello emerges from the closet, and begins shooting. When Capt. Jensen and his men kick in the door, Daniello shoots the first officer who enters. A gun battle erupts and Daniello is shot dead. Lori screams as the captain attempts to calm her.At his office, Walsh grabs valuables from his safe and escapes. Before Walsh can disappear, however, Judy kills him. At a hospital, Lori tells Capt. Jensen that she does not know much about Walsh's business. When he tells Lori her mother is in the hallway, the young woman refuses to see her, but when she learns that her mother dropped everything to find her, Lori changes her mind.Later, Chang and Stevens are back on Hollywood Boulevard looking for prostitutes to arrest. Chang disguises himself as Santa Claus even though it is July, and several prostitutes are amused and proposition him. However, when he announces they are under arrest, they run. He cannot catch them in his costume, and a passerby beats him until Stevens comes to his rescue."

During the night, Kitty (LYNNEA BENSON), a tormented dormitory girl, gets up and jumps off a window to her death, without an intervention from Nurse Stevens (REBECCA ROTHBAUM) and a Guard (MARK LEGAN).Paige (NATALIE O'CONNELL), a bosomy brunette with curly hair, lives with recurrent flash-back images of her rape by her father, Mr. Garfield (DAVID MLOTOK). She escapes home The girl marks down a newspaper ad calling for actresses for a ""beneficent movie"", walking through Times Square, New York, to a photo shoot. She passes a theater which has ""Bubblegum Girls"" and ""Teen Strippers"" up on the marquee. She felt the sleaze coming down at her from the casting office walls and the way Mr. Roland asked her to strip off her clothes. Next he calls Jack - a stud that was reading a magazine in his shorts in the next room - to do a scene with her, but they are interrupted by two Vice Cops (DICK BIEL and JONATHAN BUTNAM).Marina (TERESA FARLEY), a pretty Hispanic with an Afro-style hairdo, was with her Puerto Rican boyfriend Paco (JEFFREY IORIO; also combat scenes choreographer) when he is buying drugs from a couple of punks. The young man gives the alarm, and runs away, followed by Paco, who leaves the white powder in Marina's hands. Two Narcotic Agents (ALVIN HIPPOLYTE and BEN LIZZA) raid the derelict building and arrest the punk girl and Marina.Lori (CAREY ZURIS), has a sad face and blonde hair cut short, and is sentenced into detention because she committed murder. She had sex with her boyfriend Billy (SANDOR BLACK), in his car, only to see him get out and invite two friends - Ray (RYAN SEXTON), and Paul (SHAWN CARROLL) - to take her after he adjusted his trousers. First she tried to fight Ray off her, then she took a pistol from the glove compartment and shot Billy down, as he stood by the driver's door, watching her being screwed by his pal.The three girls eventually meet in the derelict New York Female Juvenile Reformatory. Don Beach (RICK GIANASI) is the concerned social assistant, apparently not as effective as he should be against a malevolent director, Miss Madison (MARITA). Before leaving the institution Doc goes unnoticed to the basement, where he first watches a girl sniffing drugs, and then Lori and five girls taking a shower in the nude.Lori is at the cafeteria when she's approached by the dark redhead queen-bee Lisa (JENNIFER DELORA) who loves to bitch, bully, and brawl, and her assistant, Rebel (DONNA ESKROW aka DONNA ESKRA), the archetypal white bad blonde. Lisa looks at Lori from head to toe, stares at her, and says, ""You've pretty eyes.""The juvenile girls in this detention dormitory come in all sizes and racial combinations, but all have in common the regulation uniform (sleeveless white T-shirts, blue jeans, and sneakers) and all look tough and mean, especially the trio of heavy, bull-dyke types: Dottie (KATE McCAMY), Deke (PARRI SHAHMANESCH) and Lenka (CATHRYN BISSELL).Some couples are formed at the cantina tables, out of love or friendship: Jen (JANE DONADIO), the small breasted curly virgin, arrested for prostitution with her pal Barb (FRANCES RAINES), with long and dark brown hair; Eula (RENATA COBBS), a beautiful black girl who cares for Gloria (SHERRY HOARD), a pregnant black girl.Rebel (DONNA ESKROW, or ESKRA), bumps into Marina (TERESA FARLEY)'s shoulder, and then throws abuse at her. The dark Latina snarls, ""Don't make me get up. If I do, I'll be twisting some tits!"" Of course Rebel dares her to, so Marina stands up from her table, and in a quick move wrenches Rebel's ear-ring off, tearing the left ear lobe in the process. The blonde screeches in pain, and punches the dark girl under the breasts. Cheered on by the other girls, they fall in a tangle and roll on the floor, then on top of a table, until they square up again, face to face, and Marina delivers a straight punch to the jaw that KO's the blonde.Paige strips for the drug addicted Doctor DeMarco (DAN BARCLAY), and entices him to have sex with her in the infirmary, while in a near-by cell Rebel does the same with Tom (MARC UMILE), one of the guards. Marina and a handsome black guard, Zulu (DAVID SOTOLONGO), also have passionate sex in the nude. The girls are using their bodies to get protection from the men, that will eventually prove necessary.Rebel is keeping a lesbian relationship with nurse Stevens (REBECCA ROTHBAUM), a slim woman, to get drugs from her, and with the queen-bee Lisa, whose toughness she admires.During visiting hours, Paco gives a small revolver to Marina, for her to hide in the dormitory, as part of a plan to assault the premises and rob the stocks of drugs stored in the infirmary.Valeska (CHARMAGNE ECKERT), a silver blonde, with lose hair to her waist, entices a guard (MARK LEGAN) into a dark corner, and gives him a blow-job (scene cut in some versions).Doctor DeMarco, under the effect of drugs, forces Jen to have sex with him, and the girl hangs herself afterwards. When the news is passed in secret to Barb at the factory yard, the girl has a hysterical fit, and her companions feel sorry for them.A party is organized by Miss Madison, attended by the girls and their boyfriends, including Paco and others - Roland (HARVE SOTO) and Jack (LANCE BRETT). Many of the girls end up dancing lasciviously to lyrics like ""Innocent pearls can change to bad girls"", but mostly the girls dance with each others. Some are taunting the male guards, to which Zulu is the first to respond, though he is stopped by the frozen stare of Miss Madison.McCoy (WILLIAM PETERSON), a mustachioed guard, pinches Lori's bum, and is slapped by her. Miss Madison is dumb enough to believe the man's false report, and sends Lori to the solitaire cell, with a brunette guard, Sperrazza (DEBRA LESTER). McCoy follows them, and when his female pal goes away, he enters the cell and rapes Lori, while Stevens watches them from a peep-hole, and climaxes with the scene. Afterwards, McCoy leaves, and Lori goes for a nude shower, despite there is a Big Guard (TOM BILLETT) using the facilities himself. He respects her, though. Stevens injects herself with more drugs.Queen-bee Lisa (JENNIFER DELORA), a curly dark brown hair inmate, defies Harper (RACHEL HANCOCK), a blonde guard of Amazonian proportions, with a large mane of curly blonde hair tied in a bun, to a one-on-one fight. No reason is given for the fight. The two women lock themselves in a basement warehouse, and exchange hard slaps, followed by body punches. They don't try to protect themselves, on the contrary, they hold each other close by a good grab on their hairs with the free hand, and they trade blows to the head, but most to breasts and belly, alternatively, except for a short grappling on the cement floor. When both are too exhausted to continue, they fall apart and agree to postpone the fight.Then Lisa goes in a killing spree. Angel-face Rebel entices Valeska to the basement under a false pretext, and Lisa strangles the silver blonde from behind with a piece of wire, cutting off her throat.Paige is forced by Miss Madison to meet with her father at a city restaurant. She starts talking with him, but soon the memory of what happened between them is too strong for her to keep quiet, and she starts denouncing his past actions in a loud voice, disturbing the customers, one of whom asks quickly for his bill (CHUCK MURDOCH), and leaves before the lunch is served, under the astonished stare of the Waiter (JOHN ABBATO) and the Counter Lady (MARIE LOFFREDO).Gloria has her baby in the basement, in secret, with the help of one of the guards - Tom - and her friends Eula, Marina and Paige. The baby (LOVELL DIXON) is going to be hidden before the escape attempt planned by Paco and his gang.Rebel calls Paige to the top of a staircase, where Lisa attacks her. Paige is so dizzy from the first blow to her head that she can't fight back, and is thrown down two flights of stairs, breaking her neck in the fall.Lori meets with the Big Guard, and lets him know the strange goings-on she has witnessed, and the fake suicides to mask Lisa's killings. They make love, to assuage her pains (off camera).The revolt erupts. First two, then a number of girls attack the female guards, and both the strong Sperraza and a small brunette (CAMILLE VALIDUM) go down without almost no fight.Harper goes after Rebel and Lisa, and they find themselves alone in the warehouse. Lisa defies Harper to fight to a finish, this time with the added spice of doing it in front of her lover, Rebel. Harper throws away her service truncheon, accepting a fair duel. It is a long, and brutal fight, in which the guard's advantage of size and weight prevail, exacting sadistic pain with repeated crotch kicks delivered by her heavy boots. Lisa is beaten senseless against a brick wall, under the stare of Rebel, who doesn't move until the butch guard walks away. (The character of Harper is not shown again in the film, creating the possibility that her death, eventually by a treacherous attack by Rebel, was cut before the movie's release.)Meanwhile, another triangle gets untangled in the basement. Paco has come to free his woman and battles with Zulu, both armed with heavy wooden stick and truncheon, respectively, under the eyes of Marina, who is holding Paco's gun. Zulu looks like he is going to be the winner, but Paco hits him in the crotch with his stick, the black guard is paralyzed with pain and falls to his knees, then he is clobbered senseless. Paco sadistically breaks Zulu's skull when he is defenseless on the ground, and when Paco goes to embrace and kiss Marina, she shoots him the belly.Tom is helping Gloria to escape with her baby, helped by Eula and Barb. Suddenly they found the escape route closed, and another guard stands between them and the route back. Barb is holding a shot-gun, and she shoots this guard, aiming at his crotch, thus opening way for their escape.Rebel first joins the revolt, then comes back to the basement, and helps Lisa to come back to her senses, and then they go upstairs together.Lori (CAREY ZURIS) gets a shotgun, kills McCoy and confronts Stevens, Madison and Lisa in the infirmary. Stevens is going to say that the one behind the drugs scheme inside the dormitory is the doctor, when he shoots her in the chest. Lori immediately fires at DeMarco, killing him, too.Madison goes forward, to grab Lori's arms, and Lisa suddenly picks up from under a bed a murderous looking primitive weapon, a big wooden club spiked with large nails. Lori is doubling over, trying to regain control of the heavy shot-gun, and Lisa strikes to her head. Lori is straightening up to face her, and shoots from below, at close range, taking her full in the chest and projecting her lifeless body back. Then she finishes blonde Miss Madison, again with a shot to her chest.The next scene, at the prison's cafeteria, creates a full circle. Rebel brings a New Girl (MAGGIE WAGNER), a pretty black haired girl, to Lori, who is sitting at the place where the late queen-bee used to sit. Lori looks the new girl from head to toe, stares her eye to eye, and says, ""You've pretty eyes."""

Writer Morgan Hanna is having flashback nightmares about the death, believed to be a suicide, of her fiancé Jeremy Crown that happened seven years prior. Thinking she had overcome her grief, she began suffering from writer's block. Her contracts and agent were becoming increasingly impatient. She went through the motions, talking to a therapist and trying to work through her pain that obviously still plagued her. Having repeat nightmares of the tragic night she lost her beloved.She began writing about her experiences and received a letter from Millie Crown (who would have been her mother-in-law) asking her to visit and come out to Orcas Island to be near her, expressing how much she missed her son's beloved.Morgan decided to take Millie up on her offer and flew out to Washington State from New Your City to finally reunite with the family. During the drive back to Millie's house, they drove past the lighthouse that Jeremy fell from. The past wounds were everywhere. The memories were everywhere.Once settled in, there Morgan began writing out a play that, as the story unfolded, seemed to write itself. Writing a free-form of poetry about the unshakable bong between her and Jeremy and how she felt robbed of all happiness because of something that she couldn't understand or explain. She had been carrying around this pain of not knowing why he would kill himself. As she worked more on her play, the more the spirit of Jeremy drew closer. Morgan began seeing him in glass reflections of windows and doors, and felt his presence right there with her the whole time.Millie had arranged for Morgan to work with the local theater company to put on her play that would consist of five different voices and characters speaking in turns as one character that had been shattered. All shadowed in black as the constant rotation of a lighthouse beacon turned.Morgan's play was mainly all about the events that happened regarding the lighthouse and the vows her and Jeremy would make with each other if he had lived. As the haunting intensified, Jeremy would eventually inhabit the body of his brother John Crown, to be able to make love to her. But John had eyes for Morgan for an apparent long time. When John wanted to talk with Morgan the next day about wanting to take care of her and that he loved her, she became distraught and tried to explain that she was with Jeremy and that he (John) wasn't real to her. John then becomes angry and reinforces the belief that Jeremy is gone and that he killed himself.Morgan is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and succumbs to the task of finishing the play and afterward, she'd go back to the lighthouse and join Jeremy.Once the play had been performed in full by her actors, that she could see the whole thing all the way through before leaving, Morgan felt resolution to everything and praising her cast for their moving performance, she would go to the lighthouse.John had raced after her, suspecting she was going to kill herself and desperately went to the lighthouse to stop her. Once he arrived he found Morgan standing by the railing where Jeremy had plunged to his death years ago. In desperation he told Morgan that it wasn't her that he wanted. That Jeremy didn't leave her. That it wasn't her that failed him.That he didn't take his life. John then calls out to Jeremy that he is there.Suddenly as she heard those words, she looked at John with what had to have been a sudden shock that hadn't quite finished resonating within her. A sudden realization that all this time she had been blaming herself for not knowing of Jeremy's despair and for not going with him when he went to the lighthouse to meet up with John. What Morgan learned as a flashback of that night unfolds, is that it was really John that was going to jump. Feeling like the incompetent little brother that would never be able to find the happiness that Jeremy had been so blessed with. It's explained that Jeremy, in an attempt to stop John, accidentally falls over the railing himself and to his death.Once all this is revealed, all the weight of the tragic event that took Jeremy from her, had lifted off of her and she was visibly free of what was haunting her for a very long time. Breaking away from a spell and rushing back down the steps of the lighthouse, Morgan headed back to Millie's. Free of doubt and finally having the knowledge that it wasn't her fault. That John's lies to the family about what happened was to mask what really took place. Morgan being relieved, shocked, shaken, and crying tears through a laughter that could be described as one being freed from a life sentence.Going back to Millie's house to plan and start her life again without the crippling burden that plagued her, she found the final piece of the play written for her by Jeremy's ghost."

A painter goes to a forest to seek inspiration for his next work. He falls asleep under the great elm tree. When he wakes up, he discovers that he can understand and talk to the animals and creatures of the forest. He learns that a mad villainous creature called the Cactus King is building an army of magical living weapons and monstrous machines that can obliterate the forest and its inhabitants in no time. His mad goal is to create a wasteland where only cactus can prosper. The painter teams up with a mead-loving mighty bear, three young brave hedgehog brothers, wise beaver and other animals, to defend the forest from the villain. Since the spirit of the forest lives within the great elm tree, if it falls, the forest dies. The good guys must come up with a plan to infiltrate the Cactus King's foreboding dark castle and defeat him there, but also unite the forest and put up defenses against his army. However, the Cactus King has his own allies in the forest like the spectator raven, the cowardly wizard and the tribe of sinister fungi-people, who don't care about what happens to the world above, since it doesn't affect them. The movie was made in Yugoslavia a few years before the breakup and to this day has the status of a classic among the peoples of former Yugoslavia, due to its high production value close to that of popular western animation, engaging storyline, scary villains and fun characters. The movie was dubbed in English for the foreign markets, but it's by far best known in former Yugoslavia, especially Croatia, where most of the team that worked on the film is from. A sequel called The Magician's Hat was released in 1990, with the wizard from this movie as the hero, but the film was deemed inferior to the original in almost all aspects. A painter falls asleep beneath a magical elm tree and awakens with magical powers that allow him to communicate with the creatures of the forest. In the limited time that he possesses these powers, he must help save the forest from the threat of the evil Cactus King.—Anonymous"

According to Bhajandas, Charandas should marry and start a family of his own.
But Charan is hell bent on becoming a wrestler and is even ready to remain a bachelor until 40 as per the norms of Ustad Mastram Pahelwan (Om Prakash). Rules also include no drinking, no smoking and no dating..
However, one day (2 yrs after meeting Mastram), Charan's thoughts are challenged when he sees Chameli (Amrita Singh) at Kallumal ""Koylewala"" (Pankaj Kapur) Chameli's Father coal depot. Chameli is in school. The attraction is mutual and they start dating. Charan is 12th fail and Chamelie has failed 8th 4 times.
He realizes that to marry her, he may have to leave Mastram's Akhara.Charan does so and seeks help of Adv. Harish (Amjad Khan), a close friend of his brother. Charan wants Harish to help him out smart Mastram. Harish appreciates Charan's love and is ready to help latter. Charan dares to confess his love to Chameli (On Harish's advise, Charan sends Chameli a love letter). Chameli is super excited but her friend Anita is skeptical and wants Chameli to ask Charan about his income etc (Anita says that monthly income should be rs 2000, which Chameli argues and reduces to rs 700). Harish asks Charan to write a response saying that he has a plan to earn Rs 5000/month and asks for a meeting. Anita asks Chameli to invite Charan to the most expensive restaurant in town (and includes that Anita will be coming as well).To prep Charan, Harish gives him some change and a bundle of rs 100 notes (to impress Anita).. Harish also tells Charan to be late by 30 mins and to impress Anita and ignore Chameli. The meeting goes as planned, Anita is totally floored by Charan's looks and personality. Charan also impresses her that his income potential from international wrestling can go upto rs 25000. Chameli is now jealous and decides to pay the entire bill for the meeting.
The next day Anita runs into Chameli and Charan, who were on a date. she takes them to same Pinto restaurant, an Charan is caught without any money. Charan tells Chameli the truth that he has no money and no connections, but Chameli doesn't care and says she loves him regardless. Anita (Roopini), Chameli's best friend is also convinced of Chameli's true love. The lover duo start meeting secretly. One day, however, the love affair stands exposed when a relative of Chameli (Nathulaal (Ram Sethi), Chameli's uncle) spots the duo in the restaurant (Nathulaal works as a waiter there).The respective families soon take up cudgels against their wards and make it clear that they won't allow inter-caste marriage. Chameli is kept under house arrest and her parents decide to get her married to one of their acquaintances (Son of Lachuram, Makhan. Makhan is a law grad, but his father is asking for Rs 50000 dowry).Charan comes to know of this development and decides to ask Mastram for help. Mastram is surprisingly supportive of Charan's love. He explains that just as bachelorhood is a challenge for would be wrestlers, a lover should not back out from the challenge posed by the world. Mastram, along with Charan's friends back the lovers to overcome the obstacles.Here, Champa (Bharati Achrekar) (Chameli's mom) calls in the help of her rogue brother Chhadam Lal aka Chhadmi (Annu Kapoor) against Charan. Champa confiscates Chameli's radio, so Charan gifts her a new transistor radio (which he wins by coming second in the wrestling match. First prize was a cycle)
With help of Harish and all his friends, Charan chalks out a plan to rescue Chameli from her house (Since Makhan is a lawyer, Harish speaks to him and tells him that Chameli is not fit to be his wife). Makhan, under influence of Harish, duly refuses to marry Chameli. His father goes to Kallumal and breaks the engagement. Then Charan incites Chhadmi for a fight and Chhadmi attacks him with a knife (while he is drunk). Chhadi cant hurt Charan, but ends up stabbing an innocent bystander (planted by Charan) and ends up being arrested by the police.
As per the plan, Charan abducts Chameli from her own house (He manages to lock Kallumal inside Chameli's room and takes the key away with him), while Harish sees to it that the duo legally get married (Harish visits Champa and takes rs 50,000 from her by promising that he will get Chhadmi out of jail). Charan and Chameli are initially frightened, but Harish convinces them by telling them that as long as people do not dare to marry outside the caste like them, Indians will never be truly united.Meanwhile, on learning that Chameli is missing, her parents lodge a complaint against Charan. They proceed to the place where Charan and Chameli are going to get married. Meanwhile, Bhajandas also comes with his men to disrupt the marriage. Both the parties have arrived late (and are stopped by Mastram and his troops), as Charandas and Chameli are legally husband and wife now. They vent their ire on Harish, who according to them is responsible for corrupting the duo. Harish takes Kallumal aside and explains that if the marriage is permitted by him, he will garner votes of both the castes in the election because his son in law is the leader of all the young people and also has support from the local gyms.Convinced by the argument of Harish, Kallumal relents because of being enticed by the illusion of winning the local election. Similarly, Harish tells Bhajandas that an influential Kallumal is sure to win the elections. If Bhajandas accepts the marriage, he will get special perks for his coal business thanks to Kallumal. Besides, he will get coal and cement at a subsidized rate from Kallumal. Bhajandas goes greedy and relents. In the end, Chameli and Charandas are united with the blessing from both the parties."

Landscape Suicide,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206871/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In ""Landscape Suicide"" Benning continues his examination of Americana through the stories of two murderers. Ed Gein was a Wisconsin farmer and multiple murderer who taxidermied his victims in the 1950s. Bernadette Prott was a California teenager who stabbed a friend to death over an insult in 1984. Benning's distanced approach to such grisly material is as far removed as possible from sensationalism, however. Although the acts of murder are both bizarre and violent, Benning dwells on them only minimally, emphasizing instead the details of psychological motivation, which in both cases seem frighteningly mundane. Benning has created a script which is a masterpiece of understated colloquial writing, and the actors he employs to re-enact confessional testimony and incidents recounted in trial transcripts perform with a flatly convincing lack of affect reminiscent of Gary Gilmore. The two monologues are embedded in Benning's characteristic meditations of landscape: long shots of the Wisconsin farmlands, general stores, dirt roads and pick-up trucks, and the carefully tended lawns, swimming pools, sprawling bungalows and malls of the middle-class California suburb. These images are offered in the classically spare mise-en-scene which Benning has perfected in his work as a cinematic poet of the contemporary American environment. Here, in his most accessible film so far, the beautiful, open vistas are dense with the significance of the catastrophes they engendered—Anonymous"

Juan, Jean and Roger seem to become friendly. Jean gets hold of the shotgun, but it's unloaded.Harry's plane is old-fashioned, rusty, and many instruments don't work well. Juan and Harry jump the plane with their chutes. Harry jumps on top of some Mexican police officers, and Harry says that a man and a woman dressed to the nines kidnapped him. That rings a bell with the Mexican police officers.Roger tries to drive the plane. He and his ex-wife end up talking about what caused their marriage to fail. At that moment, Roger says that he's ""getting the hang of it"" -meaning flying the plane- and they both laugh out it. Both engines die away, and they can't help but laugh about it. They have to go up to avoid a mountain, which causes a rock to fall away. That rock causes a landslide, which will kill a Mexican criminal (Mario Arreola) who had tied a young husband down and was about to rape the young wife.They take off, and Jean panickes when she thinks that Roger is dead. However, he is not, and even pulls her leg off. Jean gets angry and wants to walk through the desert. They find the skeleton of somebody who died in the desert. They walk up to Gomez (Paco Morayta) and his fellow police officer (José Chávez) who are desperate. The Mexican police officers can't understand who the criminals they were looking for had the stamina to survive the landcrash and leave unharmed on their feet. Trapping the two American runaways was going to be their road to success and to leave that ugly deserted place. At that moment, Roger and Jean appear, and try to ask for help.Gomez and his associate put them in their police car and take them to the police station. Jean and Roger ask to the judge (Jorge Russek) to be taken to the embassy, but nobody listens to them. As Jean is a lawyer, she explains the story. They are put onto a cell, where they argue some more. Finally, Roger admits that he was worried about Jean, and that was why he got angry when she appeared so late after work non-chalantly, and that was why he broke some bric-a-brac at home - which was the last drop for Jean and pushed her to apply for divorce.The judge tells them that the American embassy has already been contacted. They will be freed at the end of the week if the embassy checks their backgrounds. Meanwhile, Juan and Harry were plotting to rob the bank of the Mexican town. However, Juan is already drunk, but the bartender (Víctor Alcocer Gómez) serves him some more. There, he overhears -when Gomez and his mate are celebrating that the Americans are on gaol- that Jean and Roger are at the local prison. Juan tells Harry that there's a change of plans, and they use the dinamite to blow up one of the walls of the prison.Juan and Harry take Roger and Jean to the derelict boat which is waiting for them to sail away. Captain Irvine (Roger Cudney) betrays them and the police arrive. Juan and Harry are left to shoot the police off, and Jean and Roger end up in the boat floating away. The sea storm makes them wet and pushes the boat towards the sea. Inside the boat, Jean and Roger wake up cold, tired, wet, but they talk some more and this time they kiss.Roger tries to control the beat, but it's impossible. He gets thrown overboard by the huge waves. Below, Jean gets knocked out unconscious, and Roger's doctor bag is kept close to her.The boat reaches shore. Some sailors pick unconscious Jean up. She is taken care by a missionary (Ken Hixon), who finds Roger's surgery tools very useful. Jean is well again, but worried about Roger, who couldn't be found.Roger arrived to the jungle. He is woken up by a coconut hitting him on his belly on the shore of some beach. He initiates Jean's search, but falls onto a hunting trap. The tribe from the beginning of the film takes him to the sick daughter, where the witchdoctor has been tied down until he gets sober again. He is released now that Roger is there. Roger tends to the little girl, but he can't do anything until he's got some surgical instrumetns. He tries to mimic that the girl needs to be taken to hospital.The tribe finally understands, and they take the girl to the closest missionary post on a hand-made hammock. The missionary is there because he told a little boy (Roberto Sosa) that Jean's rescue was not a miracle. A rock falling from the helicopter which was taking Jean out of there started a car which crashed onto the mission and tore it to pieces. When Roger comes in with the little girl, the missionary man is being tended to as well. He helps Roger produce emergency surgery on the stop. Later on, the returning helicopter will take the little girl to a real hospital.There, an interpreter (Marie Butler), announces to the family of the girl that she'll be all right in their own language.

A man named Bhagwaan helps Swaroop recover this amount, and asks him to return back to his village, as the city is not a good place for a simpleton like himself. Swaroop decides to stay, and Bhagwaan assists him to find a roof over his head, as well as employment. Swaroop meets with an attractive young woman named Bijli, and he is attracted to her. What Swaroop does not know that Bhagwaan is a notorious gangster known in the community as Bhagwaan Dada, and that Bijli is a woman of questionable character and means, who works during the night as a prostitute.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) A naïve young man new to the big city -- Bhagwaan (Rajnikanth) -- turns to crime to avoid starvation. He is drawn into the gang of slum crimelord dada Shambu (Danny Denzongpa) where he falls into every crime but one: violence against women. When an impoverished but honourable young widow hangs herself after being raped by Shambu Dada, the cries of her orphaned baby awaken Bhagwaan's soul. He rebels against his former master. Bhagwaan vows to atone for his formerly evil life, and adopts the orphaned baby as his own son. The innocent young boy becomes Bhagwaan's source of personal redemption and the inspiration for all that he does.Years later the man now lovingly hailed as ""Bhagwaan Dada"" has transformed the slum where the unfortunate widow had met her evil fate into a poor but honest, safe, and happy neighbourhood where his adopted son Govinda (Hrithik Roshan, aged 12) has become the pride and joy of the whole community. Despite his own dark past, this loving father has worked hard to raise the boy as a good person with sound moral values. Song: Tujhse Pehle Bematalab.At this time, Bhagwaan chances to rescue another naïve young man new to the big city -- Swaroop (Rakesh Roshan) -- when Shambu Dada's gang steal all Swaroop's money. Impressed with Swaroop's education as well as the similarity of situation to his own arrival in the city years before, Bhagwaan takes the ""innocent and simple"" village-born fellow under his protective wing. He arranges a good job, even brings Swaroop home to live with himself and his son, young Govinda. Swaroop and Bhagwaan claim each other as 'brothers'.One day on a roadway nearby the district, members of Shambu Dada's gang assault a beautiful young woman whom Shambu lusts after. Swaroop hears her cries for help and tries to rescue her, believing as Bhagwaan does that: ""It is every man's duty to honour and protect women."" But Swaroop is a gentle bookish soul who does not know how to fight. He is badly beaten by Shambu's men before Bhagwaan can rescue him in turn. The young woman (Sridevi) who gives her name as Bijli insists on tending the wounded Swaroop who bravely tried to help her. Bhagwaan invites Bijli to come live at their house until she can find a place to stay. After some initial confusion when Govinda mistakes Bijli for his new 'uncle' Swaroop's wife, all four of them -- Bhagwaan, Govinda, Swaroop, and now Bijli -- live happily in Bhagwaan's modest home, Govinda remaining impishly determined to matchmake between Swaroop and Bijli.However, what neither Bhagwaan nor Swaroop realise is that Bijli is a streetwalker.Intercepted on her way out to work one evening, Bijli spills Bhagwaan a yarn about how she is secretly an undercover policewoman assigned to pose as a prostitute in order to arrest real prostitutes and their patrons. Bhagwaan believes her. He preserves her 'secret', and all four continue happily in the house just as before, ignorance being bliss.The audience soon learn, though, that appearances are deceiving: Bijli is not, actually, a sex worker but rather working a fraud scam wherein she bilks potential johns of money through clever ruses.Meanwhile, Shambu Dada has sworn revenge against Bhagwaan for foiling his plan to abduct Bijli. After brutally beating to death one of his gangmembers who botched the abduction, Shambu dumps the corpse in Bhagwaan's territory seeking to frame Bhagwaan for the murder.The honest policeman Inspector Vijay (Paresh Rawal), though, is fully aware of Shambu Dada's crime empire activities as well as Bhagwaan's reformation. When Bhagwaan discovers the corpse and duly reports the murder, Inspector Vijay not only fails to arrest Bhagwaan but even goes to the trouble of introducing Bhagwaan to a newspaper reporter -- Madhu (Tina Munim) -- who is researching crime trends in the city, and recommending that she visit the poor-but-peaceful-and-happy neighbourhood, Shantinagar, which Bhagwaan has built from the formerly crime-ridden slum.The street-savvy Bhagwaan helps Inspector Vijay set a trap that allows the police to capture Shambu Dada in possession of the murder weapon. Shambu is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. All seems well.Bhagwaan duly invites Madhu to attend a joyous public celebration in Shantinagar. Song: Ishq Ki Hai Bahar. When young Govinda mischievously invites Bijli to garland his 'uncle' Swaroop, we discover that the blushing Swaroop hides a growing attraction to Bijli. Song: Aaj Dil Tu Le.When Madhu reciprocates Bhagwaan's invitation by inviting him and Swaroop to her birthday party at a fancy hotel, Bijli manages to talk her way along. With comic result. The buxom dancer hired as entertainment for the party sits on Swaroop's lap during her song, whereupon Bijli blows up and slaps the dancer. Hotel management threatens to halt the party. But Madhu herself intervenes along with Inspector Vijay, who is also attending, and smooths things over. Bijli, embarrassed by her earlier spontaneous outburst, now offers to make amends by performing herself. Song: De De Dil. Bijli amazes everyone -- but especially Swaroop -- by singing and dancing a hot song even better than the now departed professional. Peace is restored to the party.Late that same night after returning, Swaroop sits up alone after the household has retired and ponders Bijli's peculiar behaviour at the party. Bijli comes upon him thus, and at his prodding finally confesses how she reacted jealously at the dancer's actions because she has come to love Swaroop, just as he loves her. She tries to explain that no future is possible between them. But Swaroop, ecstatic at learning his feelings are returned, simply won't listen.Unbeknownst to all, however, the evil Shambu Dada gets his gang to arrange his escape during transfer between prison facilities. The escape is successful, but several policemen are killed in the process. He is now a fugitive murderer, but Shambu is free! Knowing that the police will now shoot to kill, he vows to revenge himself upon Bhagwaan at all costs.While warning Bhagwaan of his danger at Shambu's escape, Inspector Vijay happens to mention that Bijli is not, in fact, working for the police at all but has actually been arrested, if released, on suspicion of prostitution. Bhagwaan angrily confronts Bijli. Devastated, Bijli humbly confesses she lied about working with the police. Bhagwaan strikes her and throws her out of the house ... and the whole neighbourhood. When Swaroop returns home he wants to support Bijli but it is already too late: Bijli is gone.All now seems lost for our lovers.But wait! A chance encounter with a doctor at a local hospital reveals Bijli's true story: she has nobly sacrificed her reputation in order to raise money for the surgery and medicines needed to save the life of her sole surviving relative, a little sister, after the rest of their entire family were killed outright during the Bhopal Disaster. [1984 -- cyanide gas cloud]Abjectly chastened, Bhagwaan and Swaroop comb the city for the missing Bijli, and almost abandon all hope.Swaroop finally discovers 'Bijli' -- whole real name is now revealed as Geeta -- at the hospital, and the lovers are reconciled. Bhagwaan then forgives Geeta for having lied to him. Geeta forgives Bhagwaan for having struck her. Bhagwaan begs Geeta to tie a rakhi on his wrist to claim him as her brother. He pledges himself to both pay for the little sister's operation and see his 'sister' Geeta married happily to Swaroop at the earliest opportunity. Swaroop and Geeta fantasize about a blissful wedding night with each other. Song: Aayaa ... Aayaa ... Pyaar.Swaroop's aged mother comes from his old village to welcome Geeta and bless Bhagwaan and Govinda -- who is jubilant that his matchmaking efforts succeeded -- for their role in getting her son married. Geeta's little sister's operation is successful, so she also joins the household. The whole of Shantinagar eagerly helps with preparations for the upcoming wedding.Madhu, who is herself becoming romantically interested with Bhagwaan, comes to Shantinagar on the day before the big event ""to help with wedding work"". Govinda persuades Madhu to help him distribute the last of the wedding cards throughout the community.Hours later Bhagwaan becomes alarmed to discover that neither Govinda nor Madhu has come back -- that in fact neither is now anywhere to be found in Shantinagar. Bhagwaan borrows a bicycle and sets off in search of them.Some distance beyond the end of the city Bhagwaan comes across an exhausted and terrified Madhu, who explains how both she and Govinda had been kidnapped by the gang of the fugitive Shambu Dada and taken to a ruined fort hidden in the wilderness. Shambu intended to rape her, but brave young Govinda had attacked Shambu so that she could escape, asking her to ""Bring Father"" for help.Now in a panic himself, Bhagwaan bicycles alone deeper into the wilderness. After some distance he comes upon a small bullock cart mysteriously left to wander by itself. A weak voice calls out ""Father?"" as Bhagwaan passes. It is little Govinda, who has been horribly mutilated and left to die. Govinda explains in a failing voice how he succeeded in overcoming Shambu's gang with the fighting skills his father taught him, but was unable to defeat Shambu himself. Shambu then vented his rage, at being cheated of Madhu, by brutally crushing Govinda's legs -- ""There were nails in his shoes, Father ..."" -- leaving the boy paralysed and bleeding to death.After receiving final blessing, Govinda dies in his father's arms ... having sacrificed his own all-too-short life to save the life of another.As darkness falls in the wilderness, Bhagwaan tenderly burns his son's remains in accordance with Hindu ritual. Song: Main Tujhse Bichhad (melody reprising Tujhse Pehle Bematalab).Bhagwaan solemnly vows to be avenged upon Shambu, and binds Madhu to silence regarding Govinda's murder lest the wedding be interrupted.The wedding of Geeta and Swaroop goes forward, attended by the whole of Shantinagar. But part way through the ceremonies someone discovers that they're missing the sendur (vermilion) needed to fill the bride's hair parting for the ritual. Bhagwaan rushes off to buy the essential sendur.Shambu confronts Bhagwaan in the marketplace. They fight bitterly, until Bhagwaan at last overwhelms Shambu. Remembering poor Govinda's last words, Bhagwaan dons one of Shambu's horrible nail-studded boots and uses it to finish off Shambu. Or so he thinks. At the very last, the dying Shambu manages to hurl a hidden knife that pierces Bhagwaan's chest.Knowing himself to be mortally wounded, Bhagwaan returns to the wedding just at the point where the ceremony requires him, as the bride's brother, to bless the newly wedded couple -- which he does, using a smear of his own red blood instead of the hard-won sendur. Geeta and Swaroop now realise he is injured and dying, then realise that Govinda, too, is missing. Bhagwaan responds that he is ""on his way to join Govinda"" ... and dies in their arms in his turn.Swaroop and Geeta pledge to continue Bhagwaan's legacy at Shantinagar."

Suhagan,1986,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187528/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Suhaagan is a story about two sisters Janaki and Jyoti who live with their parents. Ramu lives in the same village and makes a living by farming. Ramu loves Janaki but Janaki is not interested in Ramu as she is more attracted to Murli who is wealthier than Ramu.

No living person knew how he came about this blessed village - but initially was shunned by both Hindus and Muslims, especially by Bal Bhate who though Sai was a Muslim and forbade him to enter any Mandir; Rohila, a Muslim, who thought Sai was desecrating the local Masjid by performing Hindu prayers and incantations, attempted to kill Sai, but then he saw both Allah and Bhagwan in Sai's eyes and became a devotee. When Sai was ready to give up his body and resurrect himself after 3 days, just like Lord Jesus, a disbelieving Bal had wanted Sai's body to be cremated within 24 hours - only to find out that Sai had indeed risen, and also became his devotee. As did Bhagoti, a leper, who was cured by Sai. Though Sai had no relations, he did call Tatya's mom his sister; Tatya his maternal nephew; a devotee named Laxmi as his daughter, and an elderly woman as his mother. Sai displayed his true form and opulence to another devotee, Nana Chandorkar. Though he lived in a rebuilt Masjid, Sai urged his devotees to pray to God, as the Creator had only created Humans - never any religion or borders - and to love and respect all living beings. He begged for alms daily so that he could collect sins and wash them away. He always uttered 'Allah Bala Kare' and 'Bhagwan Bala Kare' to both Muslims and Hindus alike. He appeared in a multitude form of deities (Lord Jesus, Guru Nanak Devji, Allah, Bhagwan Shri Ganesh) to cater to the various tastes of devotees. Sai was also fond of Nanavli, a mentally challenged devotee, who often challenged Sai, but was one of the few who really understood and accepted Sai as Vishnu's Avatar. Sai appeared simultaneously in a wealthy man's and Nana's dreams and called upon them to construct a Mandir of Bhagwan Shri Kishan. While the construction was under way, Sai prophesied the death of Tatya but also told them not to tell him and to not worry. Shortly thereafter while bequeathing the nine coins symbolizing nine virtues to Laxmi (which depict Sravan, Kirtan, Smaran, Pagsera, Archana, Namaskar, Dastan, Samveta, & Atmanivrdan) Sai was ready to demonstrate to his devotees why they should not worry about Tatya's impending demise.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
